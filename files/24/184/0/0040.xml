SECRET. Copy No.    *-CP. 40 (27).CABINET.Inter-Departmental Committee on Grants,THIRD REPORT.(Previous Reports : Interim Report, CP. 282 (28) ; Second Report, CP. 410 (26).)To the Lords commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.May it please your Lordships,1. THE Committee was directed to continue its investigations on the following assumptions, viz. : (1) that the scheme is to be a scheme for a general block grant to embraceEducation and Police as well as Health ; (2) that the scheme is to be based exclusively on general characteristics,and to report further (i) on the detailed financial effects of the scheme in rural areas;(ii) on the best method of adjustment of distribution of grant to meet the special case of the London area and other rich towns, which have already provided services in advance of the average;(iii) on the best method of dealing with Part III Education and non-countyBorough Police authorities;(iv) on the administrative arrangements appropriate to the scheme;(v) on the effect of excluding from the block grant the grants at present payable to secondary schools and other institutions not maintained by Local Education Authorities;(vi) as to the basis of distribution of any money which may be provided inaddition to the amount required to ensure that no local authority shall be worse off than at present; and (vii) whether, in the light of these further investigations, any modification in the formula suggested in Part I of the Committee&apos;s Second Report, or as to the guaranteed minimum, is desirable with a view to diminishing possible Parliamentary criticism or opposition by the local autnormes.2. The terms of reference set out above direct us to report on a number of inter-connected questions arising from the recommendations of our Second Report. We have thought it best not to follow closely in the body of the following report the order in which those questions appear in the terms of reference. We have, dealt with the questions put to us under three main heads :-(1.) Under the first we discuss the modifications required in the national formula for the primary distribution of the. general grant among the. County and County Borough authorities.(2.) Under the second we have grouped the various questions arising on the second distribution of grants which is rendered necessary by the fact that the services to be covered by the general grant are administered partly [15731] b[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1927.
by voluntary agencies and partly, within the Administrative Counties, by minor authorities. (3.) The third section deals with the administrative arrangements which will be required in connection with the scheme.I. The National Formula.3. The formula suggested in our Second Report (CP. 410 (26)) (Part II) was designed to distribute any given sum between County and County Borough authorities on a basis of general characteristics. For purposes of illustration, calculations were appended showing what would be the effect of applying the formula to the total grants paid to such authorities or within their areas in the year 1924. As was only to be expected, results differing, in some cases widely, from the existing distribution of grants were disclosed. Generally speaking, the areas which gained were the industrial areas, where population had substantially increased in the last four decades, particularly those the resources of which, as measured by assessable value, were below the level of the rest of the country. The areas which lost under the formula were London and a few of the largest towns where expenditure (on the basis of which grants on the present system are largely determined) was exceptionally high, and a considerable proportion of the counties, particularly those of a predominantly rural character.4. The deficiencies in the rural counties arise in the main from the fact that although under the system of percentage grants those areas are generally receiving a lower amount per head of population than the towns, their receipts under the Assigned Revenues System and under the Agricultural Rates Acts far outweigh any deficiency under this head and give them a substantial advantage over the urban areas. Those counties which are most sparsely populated appear to receive the greatest relative advantage from these sources of revenue.5.   This arises from three causes : (a.) The grants under the Assigned Revenues System are largely distributed on the basis of the grants discontinued in 1888, and these included substantial grants for roads, which were naturally higher in proportion to population in the counties then sparsely populated.(b.) The population of the majority of these counties has increased since 1888 in a far smaller proportion than the population of industrial counties. In some cases the population has actually fallen.(c.) The grants under the Agricultural Rates Act naturally tended to work out at a higher rate per head of population in the sparsely populated counties.6. We have accordingly considered whether the formula might properly be amended so as to improve the relative position of rural areas, though, of course, to do this without prejudically affecting the remaining areas, it would be necessary to make an addition to the total to be distributed. Such a result could be obtained in one or more of the following ways :-(a) to omit from the general grant, the whole or part of the grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts; and either retain them in their present form or distribute an equivalent amount on another basis;(&amp;) to introduce a new factor into the formula giving special weight to rural characteristics, such as sparseness of population;(c) to include in the scope of the general grant in County Boroughs services which in Counties would continue to be aided by direct grants.7. The retention of the Agricultural Rates Act grants is at first sight an attractive solution, if only because their disappearance may provoke some controversy, but we do not think that they are grants which should be retained on a general revision of the grant system. Whatever may have been the case for making a substantial contribution from the Exchequer towards the rate burdens of rural communities whose rateable capacities had been heavily reduced by relief given to agricultural land, we consider that the basis on which that grant was made though perhaps inevitable at the time was, and is, open to serious objections. The grant is in effect a percentage grant of practically all expenditure falling on the rates in rural areas, though it is given without any control either of expenditure or of the assessment on which it is based.  We think therefore that, as the object of our inquiry
is to find a substitute for percentage grants generally, the opportunity should certainly be taken of merging this grant in a unified system of Government subvention, if this end can be achieved without injustice to the rural ratepayers.8. We would feel difficulty in giving any considerable weight to such a factor as sparseness of population, if the services covered by the grant were to be confined to Education, Health, and Police, for although sparseness of population must of necessity influence the standard and cost of these services; it is not easy to disentangle its effect. Of the various grant-aided services, that of road main-tenance is the only one in which the importance of this factor stands out clearly. Hitherto, we had proceeded on the assumption that it would be impracticable to include in a unified grant based on general characteristics the existing grants from the Road Fund for the maintenance of roacls. The difficulty lies largely in the fact that in the Counties the roads which at present attract the largest grants (the Classified Roads) are used to a great extent by through traffic not originating or terminating within the County area. For this reason the burden of their maintenance bears no close relation to the general characteristics of the area. In large towns, on the other hand, the traffic, even on important thoroughfares (e.g., Whitehall), which are classified for the purpose of grants from the Road Fund, is predominantly local, and so related to the size of the town. Making use of this difference between town and county, we believe that it is possible to overcome the difficulty of including road services, by leaving classified roads in Counties to be dealt with by direct grants from the Road Fund, and by including in the general grant the road grants which can be closely related to the general characteristics of the area. The inclusion of roads enables the case of the Counties to be met, because it becomes justifiable, and, indeed, necessary, that the formula should take account of sparseness of population.9.   We propose, therefore :  (1.) to include in the services which the general grant is designed to cover(a) the maintenance of all roads in London and County Boroughs, and(b) the maintenance by all other authorities of all roads except those classified as Class I and Class II roads.(Our proposals relate to Road Maintenance only and exclude grants for new construction and improvement of roads and bridges, which would continue to be made from the Road Fund.) (2.) To introduce a factor of &quot;sparseness of population&apos;&apos; into the formula. One basis would be the population per acre, but the use of this method would be open to the objection that it would fail to distinguish between a County in which the population is evenly spread over the whole area, and one in wrhich areas of comparatively dense population alternate with barren stretches of moorland. As an alternative it has therefore been suggested that the population per mile of road might be taken; but in that case it would be desirable to limit the mileage to roads in the grant-aided categories (Class I, Class II and Scheduled roads), which have a definite traffic value. The suggestion of using road mileage as an index of sparseness originated at a late stage in our inquiry, and may require further consideration; but we think that it produces the more equitable distribution, and the calculations in Appendix I have been worked out on this basis.10. We therefore propose to increase the total of the general grant by transferring from the Road Fund the sum now paid in respect of the maintenance of the roads referred to in (a) and (6) above, about  2f.million. In view of the probability of increase in the cost of Road Maintenance, it would seem reasonable that a proportion of the additional money, which, as we have indicated in paragraph 6, would be required, should be contributed by the Road Fund.11. Before proceeding to set out the revised formula, we desire to refer to the inclusion in our previous proposals of the factor of School attendance. This factor was introduced primarily as a means of modifying the population figure with reference to the general economic characteristics of the areas. Its employment is open to criticism on the grounds that (a.) It would tend to earmark part of the grant for educational purposes and render this part of the formula liable to criticism on purely educational grounds.(&amp;.) A grant calculated in this way would be liable to affect, and in turn to be affected by local administration. [15731] B 2
12. In view of these criticisms we have decided to substitute as a factor in the formula in lieu of the average attendance of elementary school children, the figures of child population up to the age of 5. The general tendency of this factor, like that of school attendance, is to operate in favour of the poorer areas with large working-class population. The use of children under 5 is suggested because it is in this age group that the proportion of children in industrial areas is relatively highest, and it thus preserves most nearly the effect of the school attendance factor. In view of the larger sum which we now suggest should be distributed, we are disposed to think that the weight given to children in the formula in our Second Report should be somewhat reduced. The figures in Appendix I have been worked out on a basis which gives to children only half the weight given to population, instead of an equal weight as previously proposed.13.   The formula we propose is :  (1.) The population of the area is increased or reduced by one-third of the percentage by which the proportion of children below the age of 5 to the total population of the area is above or below the national average. Day population is taken for this purpose where it is more than 1 per cent, in excess of night population.(2.) The population so adjusted is weighted by two factors : (a) for poverty: by-one-quarter of the percentage by which the assessable value per head is below  6,(5) for sparseness of population : by one-half of the percentage by which the adjusted population is below 300 per mile of grant-aided roads.(3.) The figure so arrived at multiplied by X. shillings gives the general grant for the area.Local authorities would retain the proceeds of the local taxation licence duties which are still leviable by them, as. already proposed in paragraph 12 of our Second Report.14. The precise amount of the money factor for the first period of the Scheme (X shillings) cannot be finally determined until the figures for the standard year, say 1928, are available, and it will depend on the amount which the Government of the day can allocate to the relief of local taxation. As an illustration of the working of the formula we have calculated the grants which would be payable on a money factor of 31s. 6d. on the population for 1923, and in Appendix I we show how this distribution compares with the actual distribution for 1924-25.15. It will be seen that, as under our previous scheme, London shows a large deficiency. Of the county boroughs, 12 lose (6 less than Is., 3 between Is. and 2s., and 3 lose 2s. or more), while 69 gain (6 less than Is., 7 between Is. and 2s., and 56 gain 2s. or more). Of the counties, 7 lose (3 under Is. and 4 between Is. and 2s.), one remains unchanged, while 53 gain (4 under Is., 3 between Is. and 2s., and 46 gain 2s. or more). The scheme therefore shows a far more favourable result in the counties than the one submitted in our previous report, under which a majority of the counties were in deficiency. The total amount represented by the deficiencies under the present scheme is  2,089,000, distributed as follows : -	Authorities within the Metropolitan Area.	Other Authorities.	Total.County Boroughs Counties	  82,000 32,000	  107,000 40,000	  1,828,000 189,000 72,000	1,942,000	147,000	2,089,00010. The disparity between the treatment of the Metropolitan area and the rest of the country as shown by the above table is so marked that some modifioa-tion of the scheme in recognition of tho admittedly unique position of this area is,
we consider, essential. An opportunity for rectifying the position presents itself in connection with the Police. The Metropolitan Police Force, alone of Police forces, is administered directly by the Government and not by a local authority, and the fact that the local authorities in the Metropolitan Police District have no control over the expenditure on the Metropolitan Police affords, strong ground for the main feature of the adjustment we propose, namely, the stereotyping of the rate burden rather than the amount of the Exchequer subvention at a fixed figure. If the Metropolitan Police Rate is fixed, say, at the figure for the standard year, and levied as at present by precept direct on the parishes (not by the local authorities), the local funds will, as at present, bear no part of the Metropolitan Police expenditure. But, inasmuch as the general grant covers the Police as well as other services, the local authorities&apos; grants should be subject to adjustments, which may take account of the whole or only part of the amount which is referable to the Police. We suggest that this adjustment should take account of part only of the Police portion of the grant, that this should be calculated in proportion to the assessable values of the several areas, the local authorities being left in possession of any balances that may remain over, and that the amount should be adjusted so as to leave London County neither a gainer nor a loser. 17.   The detail of this plan is as follows : (1.) The Metropolitan Police rate would continue to be levied at the same rate in the   as in the standard year.(2.) From the general grant payable to each county or county borough council wholly or partly within the Metropolitan Police District, there would be deducted and paid to the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District such an amount as would be produced by a rate of xd. in the   over the area of that authority within the Metropolitan Police District.(3.) The value of &quot; x &quot; would be determined by the amount of the grant which London should receive in order to be left without deficiency or gain; the rate, on present figures, would be about 2&apos;3*A*18. It will be observed that the Metropolitan Police District comprises not only London proper, but also the County Boroughs of Croydon, East Ham and West Ham, the County of Middlesex and parts of the Counties of Essex, Hertford, Kent and Surrey. Over these areas the product of the same rate in the   would be deducted as in London under paragraph 2 above. This would remove the deficiency of Middlesex, reduce that of West Ham to Is. 3d., and increase the gains of the other authorities. This adjustment on the basis of the figures for 1924-5 results m reducing the call that might otherwise have&apos; been made upon the general grants of the authorities by a total amount of about  2,600,000, of which  1,900,000 goes to reduce or remove deficiencies and  700,000 represents additional money.19. With the adjustment proposed in regard to London, deficiencies arising under the scheme are reduced to a total of  170,000, of which twelve amounting to  130,000 arise in County Boroughs, and six amounting to  40,000 arise in Counties. If these authorities are to be guaranteed against loss, the total additional cost of the scheme becomes  7,400,000.20. We are asked in Section (vi) of our terms of reference to report as to the basis of distribution of any money which may be provided in addition to the amount required to ensure that no local authority shall be worse off than at present. The scheme submitted in our previous report proceeded on the basis of redistributing the existing total of Government grants, and the cost of making good the deficiencies was therefore the whole cost of the scheme. But the normal * and natural development of the existing services justifies, and indeed requires, the provision of new money, and if, as we propose, road services are included, it is essential to make some extra provision for meeting the rapidly growing cost of road maintenance- In our view it is desirable that such new money should, as far as possible, be given out under the formula. The revised formula which has been suggested has accordingly been framed with a view to the distribution of a con-* Note. The existing direct grant to the City Police Force payable in the standard year would be deducted from the grant to the.County Council like the grant of any other non-County Borough police authority, as proposed in paragraph 43 below. It is doubtful whether the City would desire under the new scheme to approach the County Council for an increase in its grant should circumstances give ground for such a claim, but there is no immediate prospect of the amount involved being sufficient to make the point one of practical importance.. Under the Assigned Revenues system the City declined to receive a grant from the Exchequer Contribution Account of the County Council.
siderably increased total sum, and already provides for additional money in a large majority of cases. In these cases no further distribution is necessary, but as regards the others we think that the simplest plan would be to guarantee that no County or County Borough should gain less than 2s. per head of population. The cost of such an undertaking would be about , 900,000 (including  400,000 in respect of London).21. This raises the total cost of the scheme, on the ba,sis of the figures for 1924-5 to about  8,400,000. The grants for that year which it is proposed should be merged in the scheme amounted to  60,750,000; the total amount distributed under the scheme would therefore become  69,150,000. Of the additional  8,400,000, London would receive  460,000 or 2s. per head of the population, the county boroughs  2,800,000 or 4s. 4cZ. per head, and the counties  5,140,000 or 4s. lOcl. per head.22. This formula appears to us after a careful examination of numerous alternatives to be the most satisfactory both on theoretical grounds and in its practical results; but we are far from claiming that it is incapable of improvement and we do not put it forward as a final solution to which no variant should be permitted.II.-The Distribution of the General Grant within a County or County Botongh.23. The foregoing Section of this Report has dealt with the framework of the General Grant Scheme. There still remains to be considered a series of questions which arise from the application of a General Grant Scheme adapted for services administered by County Councils and County Boroughs to a system of administra-tion which includes also a number of minor authorities as wTell as voluntary agencies maintaining Secondary Schools and other Institutions. Many of these Institutions, e.g., Universities and Training Colleges, are mainly national in character and must clearly continue to receive grants outside any scheme such as we are considering.(A.) Institutions not maintained by Local Authorities.24. As regards institutions which are mainly local in character, it would obviously be convenient and in keeping with the principles of a general grant that they should in future look for any public assistance they require to their county authority which would be receiving an inclusive grant from the Government. We understand that there is at present a tendency for many of these institutions to place themselves in the position of receiving grants solely from the county authority, and that by 1930 the number still in receipt of direct grant from the Government will be considerably reduced. There will, however, still be a sufficient number left to make it necessary to devise special arrangements.25. There would be a strong political objection to stopping all direct Government aid to the remainder, but it would also be very inequitable to give such aid in addition to the general grant as the distribution of such institutions over the country is far from uniform. The whole question is discussed fully in the report of our Sub-Committee printed in Appendix II, and it will be sufficient merely to state here that we recommend that the grant payable to the institution shall as a rule be deducted from the share of the general grant payable to the authority in whose area it is situated. Where the institution serves several areas, I e.g., a secondary school drawing pupils from the county borough in which it is * situated and the surrounding county, or even from further afield, the deduction should be allocated among the authorities mainly concerned.(B.) Minor Authorities for Education, Police, and Maternity and Child Welfare.26. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of our Interim Report (CP. 282 (26)) we referred to the complications resulting from the diversity of authorities by which the grant-aided services are administered, and pointed out that in any readjustment of Exchequer grants on a coherent and logical system the problem would be greatly simplified if it could be carried through in conjunction with a simplitica-tion of the local administrative machinery. Such a simplification is in itself regarded as very desirable by all the Departments concerned, but any attempt to transfer functions froni the smaller local authorities to County Councils would raise most controversial issues, and, if it were proposed as part of a scheme of
block grants, the financial reforms which the Government have in view would undoubtedly be jeopardised. If the minor authorities are to continue to exercise their present functions, they must of course remain under Government control, and if this control is to be armed with adequate sanctions, grants must continue to be paid to them directly by the Government.27.   We have therefore approached this question on the assumptions (1.) That the Government will not desire to make any radical alteration inthe position of these authorities ; (2.) That gi^ants of an amount sufficient to secure Government control shouldcontinue to be paid to them directly by the Government.(i.) Minor Authorities for Education.28. London and the County Boroughs are Local Education Authorities both for elementary and for higher education, and there are no other authorities within their boundaries having any powers for education. In these 83 cases, and in the 14 Counties referred to in paragraph 29, the problem of minor authorities does not arise in regard to education.29. Outside London and the County Boroughs there are different Local Education Authorities for higher and for elementary education respectively. The Local Education Authorities for higher education are the Counties; but the Local Education Authorities for elementary education are (a) the Boroughs with a population in 1901 of 10,000 or more, (&amp;) the Urban Districts with a population in 1901 of 20,000 or more, and (c) the Counties, whose jurisdiction is confined to the area lying outside those Boroughs and Urban Districts. It happens that there are 14 Counties (Isle of Ely, Isles of Scilly, Huntingdon, Lincoln (Parts of Kesteven), Lincoln (Parts of Lindsey), Rutland, Anglesey, Brecon, Cardigan, Carnarvon, Flint, Merioneth, Montgomery, and Radnor) which contain no Boroughs or Urban Districts of sufficient size to qualify them to be Local Education Authorities, and, therefore, in these 14 Counties the County Council is the sole Local Education Authority for both kinds of education.30. The remaining 48 Counties are the Local Education Authorities for higher education over the whole of their area, but for elementary education only over such part of their area as does not fall within those Boroughs and Urban Districts, numbering in all 173, which are Local Education Authorities for elementary education. These Boroughs and Urban Districts are commonly referred tn as &apos; Part III Authorities.&quot; They contain 29 per cent, of the population of the Counties (other than London), and received in 1925-26 31 per cent, of the grants payable for elementary education within the areas of the Administrative Counties (other than London). The proportion of the county population falling within the &apos;&apos; Part III &quot; areas varies widely from 76 per cent, to nil, and the proportion of grants, of course, varies similarly.31. A further important feature is the considerable variations in the size of these Part III areas. Of the 129 Boroughs, 23 have a population of under 15,000, while 11 have a population exceeding 50,000, the extremes being Tiverton (9,712) and Hornsey (87,659). Of.the 44 Urban Districts, five have a population of less than 25.000 and five have a population exceeding 100.000, the largest being Willesden (165,674) and Rhondda (162,717).32. If the Part III authorities in any county are to remain solely responsible for elementary education within their several areas, it is clearly necessary that each should continue to raise such part of its expenditure on this service as is not met from grants by a special rate over its own area. Similarly, the County Council must continue to charge its net expenditure on elementary education over the appropriate county area, i.e., excluding the area of the minor authorities.33. Further, if the minor authorities are to receive a grant direct from the Government, they are not entitled to share to the full in the general grant allocated to the County Council which replaces existing grants in respect of elementary education.34. From this it follows that either the general county rate must cease to-be a uniform rate over the Administrative County, becoming instead the subject of complicated adjustments in respect of elementary education, a service with wdiich that rate is not concerned and we mention this alternative only to reject it or some part of the general grant must be appropriated for the purpose of reducing the special county rate for elementary education, this rate not being levied in the areas of the Part III authorities.
40. In these circumstances we consider that there would be great advantage in not attempting to lay down precise rules at present as to how such part of the general grant to each Administrative County as is not earmarked at the outset to particular funds or authorities is to be dealt with, but that provision should be made in the legislation introducing the general grant for a scheme of allocation to be prepared in each county which contains Part III authorities, such schemes to be submitted for the approval of the Department concerned and to cover the period for which the general grant is fixed. Such a course would enable the distribution of grant to be kept more closely in accordance with the general development of educational policy, and would facilitate the adjustments of that policy to the peculiar circumstances of particular areas.(ii.) Minor Authorities for Police and Maternity and Child Welfare.41. The minor authorities for Police consist of 51 non-County Boroughs distributed among 34 Counties. All but two (St. Albans and Grantham) are also Part III Education Authorities, and of the 34 Counties containing non-County Police Boroughs, all but one (Lincoln, Parts of Kesteven) contain Part III Education Authorities. No Urban District is a Police Authority. Like Part III Education Authorities, the non-County Police Boroughs show considerable variations of size, the smallest being Tiverton (9,712 inhabitants), and the largest Chesterfield (61,232 inhabitants). We recommend that the method of dealing with Part III Education Authorities proposed above should be applied also to these cases.42. It should, in our view, also be applied to a number of minor authorities (including a few rural district councils) who receive grants for maternity and child welfare direct from the Ministry of Health. The total amount is small (about  100,000 outside London), but it has been decided in connection -with the Poor Law Reform Scheme that it will be necessary to make provision for the continued payment of these grants direct by the Department.43. We summarize our recommendations on the question of minor authorities-for education, police and maternity and child welfare, as follows : That as regards those counties which contain minor authorities for elementary education, police, or maternity and child welfare, the grant be allocated as follows,, subject to the necessary certificates (see paragraphs 68-70) from the Departments; concerned : (i.) To each minor authority and to the corresponding special purposes accounts of the County Council an amount equal to the grants for these three services received in the standard year adopted for the purposes of the-national scheme.(ii.) The amount of the difference between the total grants paid within the area of the Administrative County in the standard year, and the total of the amounts allocated under (i) above, to be allocated at the discretion of the County Council.(iii.) In order to provide for the minor authorities, for the purposes of the services in question, an equitable share in any new money which may be assigned to an Administrative County under the national formula, a scheme to be prepared by the County Council in consultation with the minor authorities, and submitted for the approval of the Government; such scheme to show, in addition to the allocation to the minor authorities, any allocation to the relative special purpose accounts of the County Councils. Such schemes should normally cover the period for which the general grant is fixed.(C.) Rural District Councils.44. Under heading (i) of our terms of reference we are directed to report further on the detailed financial effects of the scheme in rural areas.45. We have in the first Section of this Report put forward a possible solution of the difficulties inherent in a scheme which placed so large a proportion of the rural counties in a nominal deficiency. The extension of the scheme to cover the maintenance of certain roads, the inclusion of a factor of sparseness of population, and the addition of a substantial sum of money to the total to be distributed under[15731] c
the revised formula will, it is hoped, go some way to meet the general objections of agricultural interests.46. But these proposals need to-be amplified to cover the difficulties which may arise within a county area. The rural ratepayer will naturally consider how the scheme afreets him personally. The effect of the Poor Law proposals under the Poor Law Reform Bill will be to spread over the county rate area, including both Urban and Rural Districts, the poor law charge which now falls on the respective Poor Law Unions within the county, and there will necessarily be a considerable change in the incidence of rate burden in all districts-, both urban and rural.47. We have given careful consideration to the position of district councils in ten counties for which detailed particulars have been worked out. We find that if the actual amount of rates levied for poor law purposes within each of these counties in the year 1924-25 had been levied by a uniform county rate the position would have been as follows : In 54 Rural Districts there would have been an increased rate (equivalent to an additional charge of  68,162).In 55 Rural Districts there would have been a reduced rate (equivalent to a saving of  64,740).In 1 Rural District there would have been no change.In 70 Urban Districts (and Municipal Boroughs) there would have been an increased rate (equivalent to an additional charge of  62,969).In 69 Urban Districts (and Municipal Boroughs) there would have been a, decreased rate (equivalent to a saving of  66,031).48. These particulars would seem to show that the change in the incidence of rates consequent on the Poor Law proposals is not likely to be substantially different in the case of Rural Districts from that in Urban Districts, and we are satisfied that it would be wholly inequitable, even if it were possible, to give special aid to the Rural Districts on account of the change in the Poor Law burden and withhold it from the Urban Districts.49. If any special assistance were considered necessary it could best be given by an addition to the grant payable to the country as a whole, and we think that any opposition to the Poor Law proposals on this account will be reasonably met by our main proposals, under which every county will gain in grant and many will gain substantially.50. The absorption into the general grant of the Agricultural Rates Act grant  even though the county area as a whole will receive no less in grants than before  will, however, within the county area, increase the burden on the rural ratepayer to the extent of the difference between the grant paid direct to the rural district and its rateable share of the same sum spread over the county. We are of opinion that Rural District Councils should receive compensation for this disadvantage, and we have endeavoured to find the most suitable way in which to give it.51. At first sight an obvious solution appeared to present itself in the matter of road maintenance. There is nothing of which the rural ratepayer has more reason to complain than the heavy and increasing charge which is imposed on Rural Districts by the maintenance of roads which are largely used by external traffic. If the whole burden of road maintenance could be transferred from rural district councils to the County Council (as has, in fact, been done in the counties of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Wight), the county rate area would bear a charge which is now borne by the districts, and the latter would in most cases get a relief more than compensating for the increase of burden resulting from the absorption of the Agricultural Rates Act grant.52. Nor is this the only argument for the change. Most Rural District Councils are not equipped either with adequate capital or personnel to enable them to discharge satisfactorily their duties as road authorities. There is no doubt that a transfer to the County Council would result in a marked increase of efficiency in the service.   In the interest of road administration, the change ought to be made.53. On the other hand, we are assured that any proposal to this effect wrould arouse energetic opposition. The minor authorities such as Urban and Rural District Councils would jealously resent any transfer of function to the County Council. Their situation is in short very similar to that relating to the Part III Education authorities and Non-County Borough Police authorities, with the difference that the Highway authorities are much more numerous.    Furthermore,
if the cost of rural district roads were borne by the county as a whole a substantial increase of burden would be thrown on the urban areas&apos; of the county. In order to compensate the urban areas it would be necessary greatly to increase the road grants, and it is improbable that the change could be made without a considerable addition to road grants generally.54. We are bound to add that if not only Poor Law but also Highway functions were transferred to county responsibility, the more substantial part of the work of Rural District Councils would disappear and there would be a danger that this unit of local administration might become atrophied for lack of occupation.55. We have, therefore, felt it necessary to make proposals which could be adopted if the Government decide to retain District Councils as Highway authorities. In this event the position of these Councils would be very similar to that of the Part III Education authorities and Non-County Police Boroughs, and we consider that they should be dealt with on much the same lines. Thus they Avould receive as a first charge upon the general grant allocated to the county, an amount equal to the grants received in the standard year, whether from the Ministry of Transport or under the Agricultural Rates Acts. Further, as long as they remain highway authorities, they would be entitled to share from time to time in whatever additional money the general grant might provide. It would be the duty of the County Council to provide in their scheme of distribution of the general grant for the allocation to roads of part of the additional money available for the County Area. The arrangement set out in paragraph 43 would make this allocation, like those for the other services, subject to the approval of the central authority. In view, however, of the large number of these authorities, there might be some difficulty, at any rate at the outset, in leaving entirely to the authorities concerned the framing of a scheme for the distribution of the money so allocated, and we think that it might be necessary for the Ministry of Transport to lay down a general basis on Avhich should be made the initial distribution.(D.) Other Road Authorities.56. In the London County area the Metropolitan Boroughs are authorities for roads, and it will be necessary that a scheme should be prepared for the allocation to and the distribution among these authorities of part of the additional money provided for the London area.57. There are also in Counties a few Urban Districts which are regarded as rural for the purpose of grants in respect of scheduled roads. The arrangements-proposed for Rural District Councils would apply to these cases.III. Administrative Arrangements.58. The revised formula which we have set out in this report contains two sets of variables, first, the money factor, which depends upon the total annual sum available for distribution, and, second, the terms expressing the general character-istics (population, assessable value, child.population, &amp;c.) on which the distribution of grant is to be based. These variables are independent each of the other, and the formula can therefore be applied to the distribution of whatever sum of money the Government may decide to appropi-iate for the purposes of the general grant, whether on the introduction of the scheme or in any subsequent year.59. If the total amount of grant to be brought under the scheme at. its introduction is to be based on. the aggregate amount of grants distributed under the existing system in respect, of the standard year, it will be impracticable, even if it were thought desirable,.to specify any particular money factor in the Bill by which the scheme is introduced, and we assume that the formula will be embodied in the Bill in such a.form as will enable it to be applied, in conjunction with any money factor the Government may. decide to adopt.60. In deciding what year shall be adopted as the standard year for the purposes of the scheme it is important to note that the provisions of Section 9 of the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1925, the Local Education Authorities will, as from the 1st April, 1928, contribute to the Exchequer 5 per cent, of the salaries of the teachers in their employ, and that the Board of Education would in the normal course pay grant on those contributions as if they were expenditure on salaries.- The effect,.as estimated in the White Paper (Cmd. 2382) explanatory of [15731] o 2
the Act, would be that the authorities would contribute about  2,500,000 to the Exchequer and receive back about  1,400,000 (say, 56 per cent.) from the Board, so that the net additional burden on the rates would be about  1,100,000 (say&apos; 44 per cent.).61. We assume that this section will remain in force as regards the collection of contributions. Under a general grant system the enactment as to grant payable by the Board in respect of the contributions would cease to be capable of literal application ; but each local authority would be entitled to expect a general grant of amount sufficient to carry out the spirit of the undertaking contained in the section; and this is a point that will have to be borne in mind when it is time to assign a value to the money factor in the formula to operate from 1930 onwards. The increase in the total cost of the scheme attributable to this cause would, however, be more than off-set by the amount of the contributions payable to the Exchequer.62. With regard to the steps necessary to determine the population factors, it will be remembered that the last Census took place in 1921 and that the next Census will fall in 1931. Assuming that the scheme will come into force in the financial year 1930, payments of grant in that year would consist of (1) payments in settlement of the grants for previous years under the old system, and (2) instal-ments of the general grant. The payments under (1) would amount in general to 10 per cent., and we therefore recommend that the instalments of the general grant should be limited to 90 per cent. These instalments could be based on estimates of population to be made by the Registrar General, but for the final settlement of the grant the 1931 Census figures should be used. These may be expected to be available during the following financial year (1931) in which the remaining 10 per cent, of the 1930 general grant will fall due.63. It may be expected that Local Authorities, before accepting the scheme, will require explicit assurances as to the interpretation of the guaranteed minimum grant. If the proposals made in paragraph 20 are adopted, the guaranteed minimum grant may be interpreted in various ways, viz.: (1) as a stereotyped amount consisting of the total of the grant in the standard year, plus a lump sum equivalent to 2s. per head of population as in 1931;(2) as the total of the grants in the standard year, as a stereotyped amount, plus 2s. per head of the population from time to time; or(3) as a rate per head of population, determined by adding 2s. to the amount per head of 1931 population represented by the grants of the standard year.64. The third interpretation affords a prospect of a saving in areas in which the population falls; but we think that any such saving would be more than counterbalanced by the additional expense in areas in which the population rises, and if the guaranteed minimum were expressed as a rate per head, the prospect of bringing such areas within the formula would be reduced. We therefore do not recommend (3), and as between (1) and (2), we prefer (1).65. With regard to future revisions of the grant, we recommend that the grant should be fixed for periods of five years. Local Authorities may ask for assurances that neither the money factor nor the guaranteed minimum will be reduced on future revisions, and as to this it should suffice to say that the amount will not be reduced except with the consent of Parliament.66. We have considered whether the Bill containing the scheme should provide that the amounts to be paid by way of general grant should be charged on the Consolidated Fund or subject to an annual Vote of Parliament. The former course would perhaps have some advantage as marking the intention of Parliament to provide from the Exchequer a stable revenue for local authorities with a larger measure of freedom from Whitehall control, but the greater part of the existing grants is voted annually, and we think it unlikely that Parliament would be willing to sacrifice the right to vote annually the very large sums which will be distributable under a general grant scheme. It is, moreover, quite in accordance with modern practice that payments of statutory grants should be made from Votes of Parliament rather than from the Consolidated Fund, and taking all things into account we recommend that the former course be adopted for the purpose of this scheme.
67. We recommend that the estimate for the grant be presented to Parliament by the Treasury and that the Treasury be charged with the duty of accounting for it, and that the issues of grant be made by the Treasury in monthly or other suitable instalments.68. It is, of course, vital to the scheme that the power of withholding grant be reserved to the Central Departments in the event of a local authority failing to administer efficiently any service with which it is charged, and it should be the duty of the Treasury to withhold in whole or part the payment of any instalment on the application of any of the four Departments (the Home Office, the Board of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transport). It would also be their duty, before making a payment in final settlement, to obtain certificates from the four Departments that, so far as they are respectively concerned, the services have been administered efficiently, and that the grant can be paid in full.69. In the event of any Department suspending an instalment of grant or being unable to issue their certificate, it will be for that Department to specify the amount of grant to be withheld, and eventually to be forfeited, if the local authority does not comply with the requirements in question. In view, however, of the reactions which any such abatement of grant may have on the services with which other Departments are concerned, we think it desirable to provide some machinery by which any such case may be reviewed in relation to the require-ments of the other services, and for this purpose we recommend that a standing Departmental Committee, consisting of representatives of the four Departments and the Treasury, should be set up, and that any abatement of grant should be taken into consideration by this Committee.70. The decision, however, as to the abatement or forfeiture of grant and its amount would be that of the Minister concerned, after consideration of the Committee&apos;s observations, and should be automatically carried into effect, subject of course to confirmation by the Cabinet in the event of disagreement between ministers.Position of Scotland and, Wales.71. In the opening section of our Interim Report (CP. 282 (26)), while pointing out that &quot; in Scotland the system of local administration differs materially from that in England and Wales,&quot; we stated &quot; that our final conclusions, mutatis mutandis, must be applicable to Scotland also.&quot; In view of the line which our investigations have taken, this statement now calls for some modification. Our experience in devising expedients to meet the case of what we have called the minor authorities in England and Wales has made it clear that the existence in Scotland of independent major authorities inevitably introduces a fresh complication. In the limited time at our disposal it has proved impossible for the Committee as a whole to examine carefully the various questions involved. We have, therefore, asked the representatives of the Scottish Departments to deal with them in a special Note for which they alone are responsible.72. While our recommendations apply generally to Wales, we understand that certain special adjustments may be required which will need further consideration.Summary of Recommendations.We append a summary of our principal recommendations arranged under the various questions put to us, together with references to the paragraphs in which the questions are dealt with.(i.) The detailed financial effects of the scheme in rural areas. This question has two aspects : (a.) The Effect on Counties. We propose to include certain road services in the scope of the general grant, to add to the formula a factor of sparseness of population, and to provide for the distribution under the formula of an increased total sum, together with a guarantee of a minimum gain of 2s. per head of population (paragraphs 3-10 and 20)..(b.) The Effect within Counties. If Rural District Councils are to be retained as Highway Authorities, we recommend that they should be guaranteed
a sum equivalent to. their existing grants for roads and under the Agricultural Rates Acts; and should also be eligible for a share in the additional money provided for the county-area in the general grant. This additional money also obviates the necessity for any specific adjustment in respect of the spreading of the Poor Law charge which affects Rural and Urban Districts indiscriminately (paragraphs 44-55).(ii.) The best method of adjustment of distribution of grant to meet the special case of the London area and other rich towns, which have already provided services in advance oj the average.We- propose to provide for distribution under the formula of an increased total sum, and to guarantee that no County or County Borough shall gain less than 2s. per head of population (paragraph 20). In the case of London we propose a. special adjustment in respect of the Metropolitan Police (paragraphs 16-19).(iii.) The best method of dealing loith Part III Education and non-County Borough Police authorities.Assuming that these authorities are to retain their functions, we propose that they should be guaranteed their existing grants and should be eligible to share in the additional money provided for the county area in the general grant (paragraphs 26-43).(iv.) The administrative arrangements appropriate to the scheme.We recommend that the grant formula, but not the amount of the money factor, should, be embodied in legislation : that for the first period of the scheme the population factors should be based on the 1931 Census : that the grant should be paid as to 90 per cent, in the year to which it relates, the remaining 10 per cent, being paid in the following year: that the guaranteed minimum should be interpreted as a stereotyped amount: that the general grant should be fixed for periods of five years: that it should be provided annually by Parliament on a Treasury vote : that power of withholding grants should be reserved: and that questions affecting more than one Department should be considered by a standing Departmental. Committee (paragraphs 58-70 and note by Home Office repre-sentatives).(v.) The effect of excluding from the block grant the grants at- present payable to secondary schools and other institutions not maintained by local Education Authorities.We recommend that, except where such institutions are national in character, grants paid to them should be deducted from the general grant of the authorities concerned (paragraphs 23-25 and Appendix II).(vi.) The basis of distribution of any money which may be provided in addition, to the amount required to ensure that no local authority shall be worse off than at present.We recommend that,there should be distributed under the formula a sum greater than the total of the existing grants, and that oases in which the formula produces a less favourable result than a gain of 2s. per head should be met by an undertaking that no County or County Borough should gain less than this amount (paragraph 20).(vii.) Whether, in the light of these further investigations, any modification in the formula suggested in Part I of the Committees Second Report, or as to the guaranteed minimum, is desirable with a view to diminishing possible Parlia-mentary criticism or opposition by the Local Authorities. The amended formula is set out in paragraph 13.   The principal change not already referred to in the above summary is that for the factor of school attendance we propose to substitute children under 5 years of age (paragraphs 11 and 12). The effect of the formula on particular areas is summarised in paragraph 15 and set out fully in Appendix I.   The full additional cost of our proposals falling to
Note as to Scotland.AFTER the most careful consideration we are convinced that, until the whole arrangements for local government in Scotland have been entirely remodelled, any attempt to introduce a thoroughgoing system of General Grant for Scotland would be politically and administratively impossible. The fact that the control of all forms of education is in the hands of ad hoc authorities, electorally and financially independent of the County and Town Councils, would alone be sufficient to render any such system unworkable. This, however, need not influence the Cabinet in their decision as to the main scheme. In the Finance Bill introduced in May 1914 it was proposed to create a Local Services (Scotland) Account from which should be paid all grants in aid of Scottish services except those in aid of Education, which were to be paid from a separate, but similarly constituted, account. The particular part of the Bill which would have given effect to this reform was dropped as the result of the situation created by the outbreak of the War. But in 1918, when the Education grants for England and Wales were placed upon a basis which was inapplicable to Scotland and legislative action consequently became necessary, Parliament adopted the solution originally suggested in the Finance Bill. This precedent might appropriately be followed now. That is, the arrangement for Education grants embodied in the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, would be extended, by means of a Local Services (Scotland) Account, to cover all grants in aid of Scottish services. The money voted in aid of the various services in Scotland would thus be a General Grant so far as the Exchequer is concerned. It would be for the Minister responsible for the Scottish Departments to arrange for its subsequent distribution, on a service basis, among the 1,327 separate authorities concerned. At the same time, the Ministry of Transport would have to see to it that the interests of Scotland should not suffer if monies were drawn from the Road Fund for the exclusive benefit of England and Wales.GEO. MACDONALD. JOHN JEFFREY.Note by Home Office Representatives.The Committee have not thought it within their reference to express in this or any previous Report any opinions on the policy of extending a general grant system to include the police, but the administrative issues to which attention was drawn in the Second Interim Report (see the second paragraph numbered 36) are so important that we think it right to append a note to this Report by way of amplifying those previous observations.In several important respects the Police Service has the character of a national rather than a local service, and the Home Office must be in a position to secure not only a minimum standard of efficiency but also the adoption of improved methods or organisation or the provision of new equipment, even though the mainbe allocated between the Exchequer and Road Fund, based on a &quot;comparison between the grants for 1924-25 and a general grant based on a money factor Of Sis. 6d., is estimated at  8,400,000 (paragraph 21). Reference is made to the position of Scotland and Wales in paragraphs 71 and 72 and in a note by the representatives of &quot;the Scottish Departments.Signed on behalf of the Committee,G. L. BARSTOW,Chairman.Treasury Chambers,February 4, 1927.
purpose may be the development of general rather than local efficiency, and must also be able to maintain their present control over the conditions of service of the police throughout the country. In these circumstances it may well be that the application of a general grant scheme to a service in which a relatively high measure of central control must be maintained may give rise to difficulties, both in the initial stages and in subsequent administration. In particular, the local authorities may expect a greater measure of freedom than the Home Office would be able to accord and may in many cases be reluctant to adopt measures involving new expense, however necessary they may be in the interests of police efficiency. Generally, we consider that the Home Office would be in a much less favourable position to carry by negotiation necessary improvements of police method or organisation under a general grant system, based on the assumption that the local authorities have the preponderating responsibility for the administration of the grant-aided services, than under the present system, which recognises the partnership of the central and local. authorities in many aspects of police administration by the sharing of expenditure between central and local funds.It is for these reasons specially important that the Home Office should be in a position to impose upon a recalcitrant police authority, without delay, an abatement of grant sufficient to ensure compliance with the Home Office Regulations or other requirements, and we fear that the Department would inevitably be compelled to have more frequent recourse to this power under a general grant system than has been necessary hitherto.A.

APPENDIX I.Effect of the Formula.THE figures below show the unmodified application of the formula put forward in paragraph 13, based on a money factor of 31s. Qd. They do not include the effect of the adjustment proposed in respect of the London area, which improves the position of areas of which the gain or loss is enclosed in brackets and marked *. The effect of this adjustment is shown in the footnote. The areas which lose and those which gain less than 2s. would, if the proposal in para-graph 20 were adopted, receive a grant equivalent to their existing grants plus 2s. per head.The present grants comprise the grants for 1924-25 for Education, Police, Health, &amp;c, as given in Appendix I to the Second Report, with the addition, (a) in the case of London and the County Boroughs, of the grants for 1925-26 in respect of the maintenance of Class I and Class II roads, and (b) in the case of the Counties, of the grants for 1926-27 in respect of Scheduled Rural Roads. It was considered necessary in the case of road grants, which are expanding rapidly, to employ the latest figures available. The increase ol the other grants since 1924-25 is relatively less important, and in some cases later figures could not have been obtained: I.

APPENDIX II.Institutions not Maintained by Local Education Authorities.1. The Committee was instructed to report, inter alia (v), on the effect of excluding from the block grant the grants at present payable to Secondary Schools and other Institutions not maintained by Local Education Authorities.2. No reference to this matter has been made in either of the two Reports that have been presented by the Committee, but for the purpose of the Tables appended to the Report, showing the total amount of the Exchequer Grants, the principle was provisionally adopted of excluding from the figures all grants paid either to Local Education Authorities or to other bodies in respect of Training Colleges and of including the other grants paid to voluntary bodies within the total of the grants shown as paid to the major authority (London, County Borough or County) within whose boundaries the Institutions are situated. (The precise details of the calculation used for the Tables are set out in a note at the end of this Appendix.)3. In the Vote of the Board of Education for the current year the sums taken for grants to non-L.E.A. Institutions amount to  2,042,995, divided as follows: Higher Education     Training Colleges .... ....     079,730Secondary Schools .... ....   1,162,165Technical Schools and Miscellaneous     127,400-- 1,969,295Elementary Education Orphanages       ....          .....        .... 14,400Schools for defective children .... 50,000 Nursery Schools and Evening PlayCentres      ....          ....          .... 9,30073,7002,042,995These grants are chiefly paid on a capitation basis, but a few are at assessed amounts and a small number are on an expenditure basis.4. Non-L.E.A. Training Colleges are for the most part conducted by denomination-tional bodies. They draw their students from a wide area, and in training them they serve to keep up the general supply of teachers. for England and Wales. These are strong reasons for the continuance of the present system of paying grants direct to the bodies which conduct them and for abstaining from charging the grants so paid against the Local Education Authority in whose area the Colleges are situated.5. If grants to non-L.E.A. Training Colleges are taken out of the range of the Unified Grant, we think that the Local Education Authorities which conduct Training Colleges should also receive grants for them outside the general grant, and, if possible, at the same rates as the non-L.E.A. Training Colleges. This was recommended by Lord Burnham&apos;s Committee on Training Colleges (Cmd. 2409, page 168). That recommendation was not carried out, but by an Act passed in 1926 the Board of Education make a levy by way of deduction from grant on those Local Education Authorities which do not conduct Training Colleges up to an amount of  70,000 and distribute it among the authorities which do conduct Colleges. This levy is intended to prevent a charge falling upon the rates of the Local Education Authorities which conduct Training Colleges in respect of students coming from outside their area to be trained.5 a. Briefly the effect of excluding from the block grant the grants at present payable to non-L.E.A. Training Colleges and of excluding also those payable to the L.E.A. Training Colleges will be to place the Training Colleges generally in a category of their own, receiving direct grant as national rather than as local institutions.6. Non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools. The system of grants to 11011-L.E.A. Secondary Schools is undergoing change as a consequence of measures which are designed to end a duplication of grant.   Under the present system the Board of
3 2 GEducation pay grants both directly and indirectly to the same schools; directly, in capitation grants payable to the non-L.E.A. bodies conducting the schools, and indirectly, in expenditure grant payable to the Local Education Authorities which supplement the Board&apos;s aid to the schools.7. The Board of Education at present regulate the duplication in such a way that the indirect grant does not begin until the Local Education Authority has spent as much in aiding the school as the Board have spent in aiding it direct, and the indirect grant is payable in respect only of the excess of the Local Education Authority&apos;s aid over the Board&apos;s direct aid. The financial effect of this is the same as if the Board paid for each school (a) to the Governing Body, the capitation grant, or\b) to the Local Education Authority, one-half of the whole aid required by the school from public funds,whichever is the greater. The object of the change which is now going on is to separate the schools into two classes of grant-receivers corresponding to (a) and (&amp;); but it will still be open to the Local Education Authorities to supple-ment, exclusively at their own cost, the aid given by the Board under (a).8. The regulations provide that Local Education Authorities will not, after the 31st March, 1928, receive grant from the Board in respect of aid given by Local Education Authorities to schools which receive grants from the Board direct. The effect of this will be that part of the money now spent by the Board in giving direct grants to non-L.E.A. schools will be paid by the Board to Local Education Authorities for increasing the aid of those authorities to non-L.E.A. schools. The extent of this reduction in the direct grants to non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools cannot yet be closely estimated; but a reasonable conjecture would be that the future aid to non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools as compared with the present may be: Number of schools receiving direct      Pieseilt- Future,grants       .... .... ....        618 .... 300Amount of direct grants.... ....    1,132,000     ....     645,0009. Thus the regulations of the Board have been framed so as to further the policy of inducing a large proportion of the Secondary Schools to look to the Local Education Authorities as their sole paymasters. The Board have proceeded gradually in this matter, and they consider that an attempt to hasten the pace unduly might provoke so much opposition as to defeat the end in view. A general withdrawal of direct grants from Secondary Schools is certainly not a course which could be commended in the interests of diminishing Parliamentary criticism.10. If direct grants are still to be paid, under the changed conditions described in paragraph 4 above, to a reduced number of non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools, we cannot recommend that the general grant payable to the Local Education Authorities should be unaffected thereby. Such a plan would run counter to the policy of devolving on the local authorities full responsibility for education within their areas and would also involve an unfair distribution of Exchequer grants as between those areas which are served largely and those which are served little or not at all by non-L.E.A. Schools.11. We conclude therefore that, so long as direct grants to non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools continue to be payable, the amount so paid should be deducted from the block grant. There is a choice between two methods of deduction: either to deduct the whole of the Board&apos;s grant to the school from the block grant to the authority of the area in which the school is situated, empowering the authority to recover from other authorities in respect of pupils coming from over the border, or to deduct from the block grants of the authority of each area served by the school a sum proportioned to the number of pupils coming from that area. Neither of these methods is free from objection, but upon the whole we prefer the second, viz., to make the deduction at the source from the block grant of each of the authorities. We do not suggest that a deduction should necessarily be made where the number of pupils coming from an area is. small. The extent to which deductions should be made will depend on the circumstances of the case, and. might be left to be determined by order of the Board of Education.12. The following figures relating to Manchester Grammar School will illustrate, perhaps at their highest, the nature of the difficulties which any

So long as the general grants to each of the areas concerned rest solely on the foimiula it will not be inappropriate to charge each area with the grant disbursed by the Exchequer in respect of any inhabitant of the area. Where, however, the general grant is determined, not by the formula but by the guaranteed minimum, i.e., by the amount of grants paid to the area in standard year, some adjustment of the minimum may be necessary. If, for example, in the fixing of the guaranteed minimum block grant, the Manchester Local Education Authority, in the case quoted above, were credited with the  12,250 grant paid to the school in the determining year, any of the other authorities named would have a grievance if, being in receipt of a general grant at a guaranteed minimum containing no part of the grant paid to Manchester Grammar School in the past, it were to suffer a reduction of its general grant in respect of part of the grant payable to that school in the future.14. Other non-L.E.A. Institutions. We should treat the grants payable to the Technical Schools and the Schools of Art and the schools for defective children (which are wholly residential) in the same manner as those payable to Secondary Schools. We should exclude from the scope of the block grant the grants paid to the Schools of Nautical Training. We should also exclude the Orphanage public elementary schools, which receive direct grants under special legislative provisions (Education Act, 1921, g 25). It may also be thought politic, for special reasons, to continue to pay direct grants for Adult Education without making an equiva-lent deduction from the block grants payable to the Local Education Authorities of the areas concerned.sotefcioa of our problem must b.e designed to meet. The school was attended o the 31st March, 1925, by pupils drawn from sixteen Higher Education Areas i England, as follows :-
15. Minor Authorities A few Minor Authorities receive direct grants as non-L.E.A. managers of secondary schools, but these grants will probably all be discontinued under the arrangements described in paragraphs 6 seq. above.16.   Our recommendations may be thus summed up in tabular form : 	Present Amount of Grants.	Recommendation.	Training Colleges, L.E.A. ,,         ,,      Non-L.E.A. Secondary Schools, Non-L.E.A.

The Education grants contained in that total omitted the grants paid to Training Colleges conducted by non-L.E.A. governing bodies, and so much of the Higher Education grants payable to L.E.As. as was calculated to appertain to the expenditure by L.E.As. upon their own Training Colleges, whether by way of loan charges or maintenance, but did not omit the grants appertaining to expenditure of L.E.As. which do not conduct Training Colleges in contributing to those which do. Expenditure of L.E.As. in giving maintenance allowances to Training College Students does not attract grant, and therefore no such grants appear in the Tables.The Tables also omitted the grants for elementary education payable to voluntary bodies who maintained orphanages, or schools for defective children, or nursery schools, or evening play centres.Subject to these omissions the grants contained in the Tables included all grants paid by the Board of Education whether to L.E.As. or to non-L.E.A. bodies, and assigned the grant received by each non-L.E.A. Institution to the Major Authority (London, or County Borough, or County) within whose boundaries the institution is situated.The Tables took no account of any grants paid by the Board to individuals by way of scholarships or maintenance allowance.
