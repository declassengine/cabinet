MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.The proposals in the memorandum - C.?.  34(27)  - of the Secretary of State for Scotland to meet from the Exchequer the whole or a large proportion of the sums paid by Scottish Parish Councils in relief of minors Dependants during the strike appear to be fraught with possibilities of grave loss to tho Exchequer.Only the alternative of paying the whole cost ( 550,000)  in Scotland will render legislation unnecessary: and Sir John Gilmour admits that if this course were followed &quot;it would bo difficult to resist tho contention that there should be no difference in the manner in which the burden in the two countries was to be met,...&quot;      In other words the English Poor Law Unions would have good ground for claiming that Poor Relief to Miners&apos;  Dependants paid by them, should be a charge on the Exchequer.      The authorised loans of Poor Law Unions in England during the strike period Increased by riot less than  7,000,000,  and the risk that we should bo called upon to find this sum from the Exchequer as well as the  650,000 is a  very real one.The same argument applies, mutatis mutandis, if we pay 75$&apos; or any other proportion.      In that case legislation would in any case be required to legalise whatever percentage is left with tho Parish Councils.-1
0 c&apos;* 10 o %It seems therefore that we mast harden our hearts and at whatever risk of opposition insist that the   charge is a local charge and. introduce the necessary legislation to legalise it0A close precedent for such legislation exists in the Poor Law Emergency Provisions  (Scotland) Act 1921 which has been renewed by an Act of 1925 which authorises Scottish Parish Councils to assist able-bodied unemployed, up to May 1927.     This they were precluded from doing under ordinary Scottish Law.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. February 9th,  1927 0
