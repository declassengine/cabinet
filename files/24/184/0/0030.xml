DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY.&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CRET CABINET Copy No.    4jiP. 30(27). POOR    LAW    REFORM,DRAFT BILL AND CIRCULAR TO ASSOCIATIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.With reference to Cabinet Conclusions 66(26) and 67(26) of the 16th and 17th of December, I now put forward (1) a draft Poor Law Reform Bill and (2)  a draft circular letter transmitting the Bill to the Associations of Local Authorities for their consideration.The Bill generally follows the lines indicated in my memorandum CP.389(26)  of the 18th of November and embodies certain modifications in my. Provisional Proposals for Poor Law Reform designed to meet objections and criticisms which have been made in the course of lengthy discussion with the Associations of Local Authorities and others interested, The ciroular to the Associations explains that the financial part of the Provisional Proposals is omitted from the Bill because the Government have now in mind a wider scheme of block grants.      It explains also that It is not necessary to provide in the Bill for the securing of better correlation between poor relief and unemployment benefit, and indicates how I propose to deal with this matter.There are two specific points to which I should draw the attention of my colleagues. J*-&quot;*Clause 32? of the Bill and the 2&amp;&amp;$m&amp; Schedule sontaln, as directed by the Cabinet., provisions for depriving persons who had been in receipt of poor relief since the last election of the exercise of the Municipal Franchise.The feeling In the Party In favour of this provision has I think made headway since the matter was discussed by the Cabinet and as I believe It to be also right in principle I recommend that it be left In the Bill.     The fact that It will
*attract the violent opposition of the Labour Party is a further point in its favour as this will tend to consolidate our own forces in favour of the Bill.The second point has to do with the continuance In force, or otherwise, after poor law reform, of the Act of last year providing for the supersession of Boards of Guardians In certain circumstances  (16 and 17 Geo. V. cap, 20 The Boards of Guardians (Default) Act, 1926).     My colleagues are aware that a Bill consolidating the poor law statutes made good progress before the Joint Committee of the Lords and Commons during last session.     The Committee issued an interim report strongly in favour of the Bill, and I anticipate that their work on It will be completed and the Bill become law very early in the next session.   ^ Among other things, the Committee decided that the Act above-mentioned should be included In the Consolidation Bill and I think their conclusion cannot be resisted on merits.     It then, however becomes necessary to decide what is to be done in regard to this particular Act in the Poor Law Reform Bill.     That Bill transfers the functions of Boards of Guardians to County and County Borough Councils.      The Guardians  (Default) Act provides for the complete supersession of a Board of Guardians in certain circumstances,     Such complete supersession would be Inappropriate and indeed impracticable in the case of a County or County Borough Council with all its numerous and important other activities.      It might be feasible to provide in the Poor Law Reform Bill for supersession of the County cr County Borough Council only in respect of its poor law functions, This oourse would, hotvever, involve serious administrative difficulties and it would be extremely difficult to defend, since one of the arguments for poor law reform which has been
repeatedly used is that the placing of the responsibility for administering poor relief In the hands of the larger and more responsible public authorities will do away with the need for supersession.      On the whole I am of the opinion that the proper course is to repeal the Guardians (Default) Act In the Poor Law Reform Bill.      I may add thatif the Cabinet accept the DIsfranchisement clause the argument for repeal Is strengthened.N.O.31st January, 1927.

Poor Law Reform.DRAFTof ABILLTo provide for the transfer to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs of the f unc-tions of Poor Law Authorities and the administration of those functions when so transferred, to amend the laws relating to the relief of the poor, and to regulate the relations between Councils of Counties and Councils of County Districts in respect to public health functions, and for purposes incidental thereto.VII.   (2.)29th January 1927.3-4
Draft letter to Associations of Local Authorities enclosing copies of the Poor Law Amendment Bill.S ir,1. I am directed (by the Minister of Health) torefer to the memorandum of provisional proposals for Poor Law Reform prepared towards the end of 19 25 for circulation to Associations of Local Authorities and others concerned as a basis for consideration and. discussion,  and to enclose herewith for the information of the Association copies of a draft Bill (Entitled the Poor Law Amendment Bill) prepared for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme of administration.      It will be seen that the draft Bill generally follows the provisional proposals, subject to certain modifications introduced as a result of subsequent correspondence and interviews between Mr. Chamberlain and representatives of Local Authorities.The Bill is drafted on the assumption that the Poor Law Consolidation Bill now before Parliament will become law in the next Session.2. The draft Bill does not include any provisiongiving effect to the scheme of financial reform which formed part of the provisional proposals circulated to Local Authorities.     The reason i3 that H,M. Government have now decided to undertake a wider scheme of financial reform covering Education and Police as well as Health and the Assigned Revenues, and providing for a block grant applicable to all these services.     negotiations on this matter will be set on foot forthwith with Local Authorities.     Por the present purpose it will be
sufficient to say that H.M. Government propose a material increase in the total Exchequer contribution to Local Authorities, with the general object of relieving the burden of rates.     It will further be a principle of the scheme that none of the main areas of local government shall receive a lower Exchequer   &apos; contribution than that of which thoy were in receipt in respect of the services in question during the period before the new scheme comes into effect. 3. As a consequence of the foregoing deoision ofH.M. Government the draft Bill does not include provision for taking out of the blook grant payable to County and County Borough Councils that part of it which represents the Exchequer grants payable in respect of maternity   and child welfare to Sanitary Authorities who are separate Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities under the Ast of 1918 at the time when legisla-tive effect is given to the proposals.     This does not mean that the provision is abandoned but merely that it is transferred to the sphere of the larger financial proposals contemplated, 4. Mr. Chamberlain does not think that it isnecessary for him in general to comment upon the provisions of the draft Bill, but he hopes that it may facilitate its consideration   if he alludes bi-ieflj&apos; to the principal modifications of the provisional proposals to which effect has been given in framing the Clauses. 5. First,  it will be seen that Clause which deals with the relations between County Councils and County District Councils in respect of public health
?&apos;-? ryfunctions,  restricts the extent of the revisionof the existing law originally proposed, and expressesin definite form the revision now suggested.6, Secondly, Mr. Chamberlain has come to theconclusion that it is unnecessary to include in thepresent Bill the original proposal to improve theco-ordination of public assistance by correlating payments of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and payments of relief under the Poor Law.     It is intended to limit the repeal of any provisions of the permanent law,as consolidated, to repeals consequential on theprovisions of the present Bill as they emerge from parliament, and it follows that in dealing with thecorrelation of unemployment benefit and Poor Lawrelief the Minister of Health will be in a positionto rely upon his existing powers to regulate outdoorrelief, which are stated in section 72 of the consolidation Bills      How far these powers should beexercised is a matter which Mr. Chamberlain proposesto aonsider in connection with the survey which heis making of the results of the recent industrialdisturbances in relation to the poor law.7. Thirdly, the powers of County Councils and county District Councils to make arrangements forthe administration of transferred services similar in kind to services administered by the latter councils are, by Clause 4 of the draft Bill, given continuing
effect so as to provide for reorganisation from time to time in accordance with the facts of growth and development.8. Fourthly in the case of London a modificationof the provisional proposals has been made the affect of which is to substitute for local committees of the London County Council the Common Council of the City of London and the Metropolitan Borough Councils as authorities to whom the administration of out-relief Is to be delegated on conditions to be stated in the scheme of the County Council.9. Fifthly, the future method of discharging thefunctions of BoardB of Guardians as to the registration of births and deaths is expressly reserved by Clause  8 for determination by Parliament.      The Minister hopes at an early date to forward certain proposals on this matter to local authorities for their consideration with a view to the submission to Parliament of a 15111 dealing with the subject.10. In conclusion, I am to say that Mr. Chamberlainhas been authorised to circulate the draft Bill to Associations of Local Authorities at this stage in order that their advice and criticism, which have been of such material assistance to him in framing the Clauses, may again be preferred before the proposals are submitted to Parliament.It will, however, be understood that if this object, which he regards as most desirable, is to be secured,  it will be necessary for  the examination of the
Bill and tho formulation of comments upon it to be treated by the Association as matters of exceptional urgency;   and he feels sure that he may rely upon their co-operation in dealing with them upon this footing.He thinks it well to add that he must ask that any communication which is to be made to him on the subject may reach him, at the latest, by the next.Hs has written in terms similar to those of this letter to all Associations of Local Authorities.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,
