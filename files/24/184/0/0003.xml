HIS DOOTB-ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAlhlC I-AJBBTY! S GOVERNMENT ). EGRET.9 c.P . 3 ( 27 )COPY MO:CABINET.THE SITUATION  IN CHINA,MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE &apos;   COUNCIL o &apos;1,      It seems to me that the rear-guard action which we are now fighting in Chins  is being fought as well as it can he foughtj and I have no immediate change of policy to suggest.      But rear-guard actions, however well fought, are apt to end either in unconditional surrender or in the unpleasant operation of dying in the last ditch,, The question therefore arises whether, if things go on from bad to worse, any alterative is open to us. 2,      fie are ready, as I understand it, to treat an effective Government in any part of China as the best temporary substitute for a non-exi-stent central Government, without prejudice to China&apos;s rights to say for herself whether she wishes to be a unity or a multiplicity of independent states, &apos; 3.      The most efficient of these de facto Governments is the one that predominates in the south;    and it is on our relations with it  that the situation for the present mainly turns.4.      We have made it clear to those in authority that we are prepared to do our part in hastening and supplementing the policy of the Washington Conference so unfortunately postponed, first by the French delay in ratification, and then by the vanishing into nothingness of the Central Government aWe have also adumbrated our general willingness pro-foundly to modify existing Treaties: - though we have never agreed either to regard these Treaties as non-existent,
or prematurely to treat Southern Ohia^!) as an independent ;state.     Respect for international law forbids the first; respect for Chinese self-determination forbids the second. 5. &apos;   But while diplomatically discussing these problems with Canton, things have not been going well In regions over which the Cantonese Government claim supremacy; and it may well be, &quot;as many think, that injury to Great, Britain rather than the interests or&apos;the honour of China lie at the root of the policy which Southern China is now pursuing.6.&apos;    However/this may be,, it seems fairly clear that if this really were the object of those who control the southern administrate ion,.. they would do-exactly what they are doing.    They would make strong-profesrions of their desire to maintain order and protect foreigners, they would in fact leave matters to the mob, &quot;knowing quite well that if foreigners,, when attacked, were left- to protect themselves the very least that could happen would be &quot;regrettable incidents,&quot; which could easily be used to. set all China&apos; in a blaze..7.;     In the face of such a calamity,, the Treaty Powers would,. so far as I can see, be quite helpless.,.     If the South were, really united,, if they were led with even moderate efficiency,, if they had behind them the excited nasslons of a great people,  it is absurd to suppose that the scattered settlements and the not lessscattered policy of the Treaty Powers could offer any effectivedoresistance;-   The most they c ould he&quot;&quot; would be to shoot,, in self defence,., a sufficient number of Chinamen - to make . the positionof foreigners in China practically impossible.8.      From all this I conclude that If the dominant policy of the South is at the moment dictated by the Soviets, they have got the easiest game in the world to play.    It would consist In each case of three moves:.&apos;l&quot;v    The promise to keep order-.&apos; 2&apos;-v   The encouragement of an anti-foreign mob to commit dis-order.3.    The presentation to the foreign authorities of the alternatives of either resisting outrage by the shedding of blood, or the de facto surrender of. /&apos; --ft-
their Treaty rights.The latter inevitably, among other evils, involves a great loss of prestigtheformer would have consequences which I do notventure to calculate, but * hich if the accounts we receive of the Chihino s e temperareaccurate might endanger the safety of every foreigner in Chinao No policy could be simpler or for its immediate object more effective.      That it would be very bad for China aswho rule Chinese policy take that view?If what I have called the   &quot;rear-guard1 action of our diplomacy is destined,  through no fault of its own, to suffer a gradual defeat, how are we to strengthen it? I am sure -the Cabinet would absolutely rule out any serious military effort conducted by the Powers either singly or together.      The objections to it are so obvious that I need not dwell upon them.      We may have to land marines to extricate women and children;    but the idea of landing an army to fight a united China,  or a united Southern China,  is absurd.,A blockade is not absurd in the same way or to the same degree.      The international aspects of it may present difficulties of which I am not in a position to speak. There may be naval difficulties of a technical  and administrative order;      but doubtless these can be overcome;, The obvious objection to It is that it would (at least temporarily) ruin our trade, and hurt us even more than it would hurt the Chinese,,      But it has to be observed,   . in the first place,  that blockade - an act of war - is a weapon which we ought not to use until it is evident that,   I whatever we do,  our economic position is already temporarilywellas for the foreigner is clear enough.-:;;ill those
9 oD aruined or on the way to ruins      In the second place, my hope is that if the Canton Government realised that we should resort to it rather than make a complete surrender of our policy of reform and reconsideration of Treaties at the bidding of Soviet-inspired politicians;, our diplomacy might be greatly strengthened.      At present the tactical advantages enjoyed by the Soviet-Canton policy (if that be indeed the policy of the Southern Government) are so great that I do not see what is to prevent them driving us out of every settlement in turn by a judicious combination of strikes, false promises and mob violence.      But if we make it clear to them that we shall not acquiesce in any illegal fait accompli, that no number of successful mob attacks will either provoke us into sanguinary and futile operations on land, or induce us to accept a complete surrender of our treaty rights;    that at whatever cost to ourselves we should, in the last resort, maintain maritime pressure upon the aggressors,  I think the hands of our Foreign Minister-might be greatly strengthened,All the belligerent Chinese provinces want money, and they want it badly0      They cannot get enough from Ruesiaj nox I suppose can they raise an internal loan.      Indeed thr re are two things which they have not got, and  cannot obtain from the Soviets.      One is money;    the other is sea power.      And if we can (of course, without making overt or unnecessary threats) make them understand that the Chinese question is not to be settled by mob violence, however well directed, by attacks on particular settlements, however successful,  I think the efforts of our diplomatic agents would be greatly aided.      At any rate, this is a line of action which might be worth considering if and when our present policy seems likely to -suffer shipwreckeA. Jo Bohittinghame, -      - -January 11th,  1927o
