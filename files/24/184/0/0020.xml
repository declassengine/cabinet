(THIS D0CUM31JT IS THE PROPERTY Oir HIS 3HITA1JMIC EiJBSWSGOvDHIJMSi-lG?).SECRET..  30(27).copy no.   SoCPCABIHET.ROYAL COMMISSION ON LAND DRAIHAGMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture and Pfisheries,1.I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to thenecessity for a complete and drastic revision of the Law;; relating to Land Drainage in England and 7ales, and to put forward for consideration a proposal for the establishment of a Royal Commission to examine and report upon the question.has been in force since the time of Henry VIII and which can shortly be described as &quot;no benefit, no rate,&quot;   This restriction of the liability for rating to those persons only who can be shown to obtain direct benefit from the drainageworlds concerned is throwing an almost intolerable burclen on a number of comparatively small areas.    Bitter aiid organised resistance has arisen in some districts, and Drainage Authorities generally are finding it increasingly difficult, not only to carry out new schemes, however necessarj;-, but even to maintain existinr watercourses.3. I am of opinion that nothing short of a completerevision of the existing lav/ and the establishment of a new basis of rating will meet the case.    The only satisfactory solution of the problem would appear to be the creation for each watershed of a body which would be responsible for drainage and possibly other natters over the whole area of the wate:.. shed ar.d have power to levy rates all over that area, [I2.The existing drainage lav/ is based upon a principle which
This is not the first time that the creation of one authority to administer the whole of a watershed has beenadvocated.    Similar proposals were put forward by a Select Committee of the House of Lords in connection with ^fonservanc; /Jtaw^ rC   in 1877, by the Vater Power Resources Committee in 1921, and are now  :eing strongly pressed in connection with pollution. The Ou.se Commission also made similar recommendations for the Ouse District in their report published last year,,5. An announcement was made in the House of Lords last session that the Government was considering the introduction of legislation dealing with the whole question of drainage, the intention then being to introduce a general Bill this year on the lines of the Ouse Commission recommendations. Further consideration however .has convinced me that the problem demands legislation (as I have e plained) of such a controversial character that it could not properly be based on the recommendations of a small Commission appointed to deal with a specific area,    I am of opinion that a thorough examination of the whole position should be made in order to create the public opinion necess .ry to carry through the radical changes which are required.6. I therefore propose that a Royal Commission should beset up, with the following terms of reference:To inquire into the present law relating to Land Drainage in England and ITales and its administration throughout the country, to consider and report whether any amendment of the law is needed to secure an efficient system of arterial drainage without undue burdens being placed on any particular section of the community, and to make recommendations, having regard to all the interests c one erne d.
7. If the Cabinet agree to the appointment of theRoyal Commission I suggest that Lord Bledisloe should be appointed chairman.W.Q.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. .25th January, 1927.
