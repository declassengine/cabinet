A* ^ 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.&quot; &apos; 30SECRET. .    Copy No.&apos;- 0 A B I H S T.I. 29  (27).8INEMA LEGISLATION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet has already expressed its concurrence with the view that all reasonable efforts should be made to increase the production of British films. If, as I hope, the Cabinet agree that a Cinema Bill should be included in our legislative programme, I shall be ready within a short time to put before the Home Affairs Committee a draft Bill, prepared after long and elaborate consultation with all sections of the trade. The Cabinet will, however, wish to know the general lines on which I propose to prooeed,I need not urge the importance of encouraging British film production.    The arguments in favour of this were set out in my previous memorandum, and I think all my colleagues agreed with those arguments.    Since then, the matter has been discussed at length by the Imperial conference and the Conference adopted the report- of their Sub-Committee and passed a unanimous resolution emphasizing the need of increasing the output and the exhibition of British films within the Empire.    The Conference also invited Great Britain to give a lead to the other parts of the Empire.Since the Cabinet last discussed this question, time has demonstrated the following facts.The trade has had full opportunity of securing an increased exhibition of British films by a voluntary effort. It is admitted that this effort has failed.The Americans will not help unless there is legislation. They were nervous of. legislation; but as legislation was delayed, they are hoping that nothing will be done; and if they can have the market for nothing, why should they Incur
the expense of collaborating with producers here?Public interest has, I think, steadily increased, which shows that the desire to encourage British films is not a stunt or passing phase.    &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, which in these matters Is careful to reflect public opinion, or at any rate to lead where it. is confident public opinion will follow, has come out flat-footed in favour of a quota.I am satisfied that a quota is neoossary if we are to take any effective action.I am reasonably satisfied that, provided the quota is not placed too high, and that the renter has an incentive to interest himself in British production, sufficient British films will be forthcoming.The Dominions will not move unless we move first.Long and detailed discussions have taken place with producers, renters and exhibitors.    They have seen in confidence the drafts which have been prepared and   have made many useful suggestions.    The Bill will therefore take the form which all sections of the trade agree is the most workable form. If there is to be legislation on the general lines proposed, the exhibitors are most anxious that, if they are to be subject to a quota, the administration should be in the hands of the Board of Trade and not of local authorities.There will be opposition from some renters and from some exhibitors, but those who oppose will have to admit -(a) that a section of the exhibitors have always been in favour of a quota and regarded it as the only wayj(b) that the voluntary effort has failed and that they have no practical alternative proposals;(o) that while they are in no way committed to the principles of the bill, Its provisions have been framed in the manner most convenient to the trade interests.
The legislation which I propose is briefly as follows:-(1) Blind booking will be prohibited, i.e. no film may be booked until It has been trade shown.(2) There should be some limitation on block booking, probably IS months from the date of trade showing.(3) All films to be registered - British and foreign films being distinguished.(4) A quota would be imposed on the renters, beginning in the year 1928 at 7-g$ and rising progressively in each year.(5) A quota would be imposed on exhibitors beginning 6 months or a year after the renters&apos; quota.   The exhibitors quota, in both time and amount, will always lag behind that of the renters,(6) Administration will be In the Board of Trade, fees to be charged to cover expenses, i.e. a registration fee on. films and a licence fee on theatres.(7) An advisory committee will be established consisting of representatives of exhibitors, renters and producers, with an independent chairman, and possibly an independent element, to advise the Board of Trade in the administration of the Act,(8) The penalty for failure to comply with the quota would be a fine and/or the revooation of the licence,(9) A British film would be defined as a film made by British nationals or by companies registered in the British Empire and British controlled, and the scenario at least should be the work of a British author.    The film should be produced in the British Empire by a personnel predominantly British.P.C-L.Board of Trade,28th January, 1927.
