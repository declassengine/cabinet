SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LIGHT LEATHER BAGS AND METAL FITTINGS.    &apos;To The Right Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.3.E., LLC, M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. By Minute of the Board of Trade dated 13th September,1926, we were appointed a Committee to enquire into and report &quot;upon applications made (a) by the National Leather Goods and Saddlery Manufacturers1 Association for the imposition of a duty upon light leather bags and other receptacles, including bags and receptacles of materials made to resemble leather, and (b) by the British Fittings Manufacturers&apos; Association for the imposition of a duty upon metal frames, locks and clasps for bags and other receptacles&quot;.2. We have held 19 meetings in all 14 of which were devotedto the hearing of evidence in the Light Leather Goods case and 2 to the hearing of evidence in the Metal Fittings case. In the light leather enquiry 14 witnesses were called before us and in addition the Committee themselves called evidence from the&apos;&quot;&apos; largest buyer of fancy leather goods in this country.    Only two witnesses were called in the metal fittings enquiry owing to the collapse of the case at an early stage.3. In both cases the parties were represented by Counsel:Mr. B.Faraday (instructed by Messrs. Moreton Phillips and Son) appearing on behalf of both the applicant Associations; and Mr. A.S. Comyns Carr, K.C. and Mr. G. Russell Vick (instructed by Messrs. Stikeman and Company) appearing on behalf of the Opposition in each case.We have throughout treated the two applications referred to us as distinct inquiries and proceed to deal with our
conclusions thereon separately as follows:-A. LIGHT LEATHER BAGS AND OTHER RECEPTACLES INCLUDING BAGS AND RECEPTACLES OP MATERIALS MADE TO RESEMBLE LEATHER. 4. Before dealing specifically with the questions asked bythe White Paper we think it right to make a few preliminary observations.5. (a) Owing partly to the   nature of the industry which iscarried on in some cases concurrently with the manufacture of heavy leather goods, and which to some extent overlaps with box-making,    and partly to the lack of organisation in the industry, it has been found impossible to obtain accurate figures and information on certain of the questions put to us.6. (b) We have throughout treated German competition as thatwhich demands consideration because competition from other countries is admittedly of little importance.7. (c) It has been impossible to give any definite figures as to reduction in employment or as to the loss of trade directly due to foreign competition.    The Applicants submitted a Summary which purports to show the output and employment in the whole of the industry for the years 1919 and 1921-5, but we find ourselves unable to place much reliance upon these figures for the reason that they were almost entirely con-structed on estimates based upon a very meagre foundation of actual figures.    The Applicants claim to represent BO per cent, of the 162 firms stated by them to be at present engaged in the industry; 27 firms gave information to the Accountant who acted for them in this Inquiry, and a further 57 gave their figures of employment in 192.5.    The only actual figures given by the firms making returns were those of employment in the various years.    Average   wages per man per annum and the percentage of total wages and materials to turnover were also
4 9given, and from these data the accountant calculated the turnover, cost of production, and employment of P.5P. firms in 1919 and 1931 decreasing to 182 firms in 1925.    &quot;ven, therefore, had all the firms made returns to the Accountant all the figures except those of employment would still have been arrived at by way of estimate.   As it is, however,.the summary also depends essentially for its correctness upon the 27 firms being a completely representative sample of the whole industry not only in experience viz., loss or maintenance of trade, but also in numbers and organisation, viz. for example, the proportion of women employed to men. We may say that we carefully examined the figures that were furnished to us by the representatives of six of the leading firms in the trade in the course of their evidence with the result that we found that they did not bear out in the essential respects the conclusions which the summary purported to prove:    the turnover of these 6 firms in lc25 and other years accounted for a little more than one-third of the turnover of the 27, and instead of showing a decline 1921-1925 showed on the contrary an increase.    It is,  therefore, obvious that no accurate deduction can be drawn from such figures.(d) It may be well to say here that we have thought it right to disregard in this inquiry conditions which are not peculiar to this particular trade but have affected within the knowledge of everyone all British industries in the period since the war.(e) Upon the question of prices the evidence produced by the applicants was most unsatisfactory for three reasons:-Firstly - In many cases the foreign samples produced were   bought in the country of origin and it is impossible to say without knowing the full history of their purchase whether
they represented a general line of goods sold in this country - in competition with 3ritish goods.    Alternatively some of the British samples had been specially manufactured for the enquiry in sraall quantities to match as nearly as possible the foreign lines produced, and their costings, while no doubt estimated for ordinary quantities, had nevertheless no other basis of actual experience than that of this special production.    We see no reason why the Applicants should not have produced samples of foreign goods bought from the wholesaler in this country and shown us at the same time the actual British article on the market in competition with it in the ordinary course, but this was not done,  or when It was done the British sample was quite obviously of a better quality. 11. Secondly - It was shewn that&apos;there had recently been anumber of bankruptcies in Offenbach, which is the main centre of the industry in Germany, and we have little doubt that a good many articles manufactured by such bankrupt firms were thrown upon the market at prices which in no way represented their normal selling price.    Moreover the Applicants themselves produced samples of foreign articles which were being- old here at 50 per cent,  of cost owing to the failure of a British wholesale house.    We do not consider that the sale of such articles constitutes a sufficiently stable type of competition to be relevant to this Inquiry.12. Thirdly - In many cases it was obvious that the Britishsamples.were made of better material or better finished than the foreign ones and did not afford a fair basis of comparison.13. (f) At the ends of the Applicants&apos;  evidence, Mr. Faraday, asCounsel for the Applicants,  submitted &quot;that the Opponents in the present Application appear either as representatives of foreign manufactures or as merchants solely concerned for
they represented a general line of goods sold in this country - in competition with British goods.    Alternatively some of the British samples had &quot;been specially manufactured for the enquiry in small quantities to match as nearly as possible the foreign lines produced, and their costings, while no doubt estimated for ordinary quantities, had nevertheless no other basis of actual experience than that of this special production.    We see no reason why the Applicants should not have produced samples of foreign goods bought from the wholesaler in this country and shown us at the same time the actual British article on the market in competition with it in the ordinary course, but this was not done, or when it was done the British sample was quite obviously of a better quality. 11. Secondly - It was shewn that&apos;there had recently been anumber of bankruptcies in Offenbach, which is the main centre of the industry in Germany, and we have little doubt that a good many articles manufactured by such bankrupt firms were thrown upon the market at prices which in no way represented their normal selling price.    Moreover the Applicants themselves produced samples of foreign articles which were being -sold here at 50 per cent, of cost owing to the failure of a British wholesale house.    We do not consider that the sale of such articles constitutes a sufficiently stable type of competition to be relevant to this Inquiry.IS. Thirdly - In many cases it was obvious that the Britishsamples were made of better material or better finished than the foreign ones and did not afford a fair basis of comparison.IS. (f) At the end of the Applicants&apos; evidence, Mr. Faraday, asCounsel for the Applicants,  submitted &quot;that the Opponents in the present Application appear either as representatives of foreign manufactures or as merchants solely concerned for
their profits&quot;  (but not as representatives of any other industry that might be affected) &quot;and that in neither capacity is their opposition relevant to the terms of reference&quot; on the ground that:  &quot;The Safeguarding of Industries Rules, while recognising that in order to safeguard and secure employment the goods concerned must be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom, relate solely to questions of employment in production in the United Kingdom and no argument has been raised by the Opponents on the present case or has evidence been offered that employment in any other industry would or could be affected&quot;. 14. We undertook to mention this submission in our Report,but are of opinion that there is no substance in it, more especially on the ground that it was essential that the evidence of the witnesses should be tested by cross-examination which could only be conducted by persons conversant with the trade, and we have had no regard to merchants1 profits, nor to the interest of foreign manufacturers, in reaching our conclusions.15. To sum up, we have arrived at the conclusion that^thoughthe competition may be keen it is not in any sense unfair and that the imports of fancy leather goods are not abnormal, and we do not, therefore, consider that a case for a duty hasbr-en made out by this industry.    In view of the large and rapidly increasing imports of artificial leather goods we considered whether a case had not been made out on these goods taken alone.    It does not appear to us, however, that any really serious attempt has been made in this country to establish an industry in this class of goods while evidence produced on behalf of the opposition tended to show that artificial leather can be produced and profitably sold in this country in
competition with similar German goods.   We are of opinion that the artificial leather goods industry taken alone can not he said at present to be a substantial industry in this country, and we have, therefore, treated it in our report as a part of the general light leather goods industry.Having stated broadly our conclusions, we proceed to consider the questions put to us by the terms of the White Paper more in detail.(l) &quot;Whether the applicant industry is by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates or by reason of the nature of the goods produced an industry of substantial importance&quot;.16. The substantial importance of the industry was not seriously questioned, except as regards artificial leather goods which point we have disposed of in our previous observations, but the Opposition drew attention to the fo.ct that this industry is only a part of the fancy ladies&apos; bag industry which deals also with bags of bead, silk and other material, and that it overlaps on the one side with the heavy leather industry and on the other side with that of box-making, and they questioned whether it can be considered separately from these.    ?/e are of opinion that for the purposes of this Inquiry this industry can be considered separately, and that, by virtue of the number employed, so far as these can be ascertained,  it is an industry of substantial importance.(P.) &quot;Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities&quot;.17. The answer to this question gives rise to more difficultythan any other.       In the first place the official figures
1 R i 0relating to the imports of these goods into this country from abroad are difficult to interpret for the following reasons:-1. The imports in our own trade returns were not distinguished for this trade before 1920 and they are only shown in values which are difficult to apply strictly, (a) the fancy leather goods heading must cover a number of fancy leather articles which are not recej^tacles and are, therefore, not relevant to this enquiry, (b) it is clear that in the years since 1921 there must have been considerable fluctuations both in the value of similar articles and in the class of articles imported,  (c) it has been pointed out to us that a large quantity of goods, especially in artificial leather, contain movable fittings which are not made by the producers of the leather containers, but ivhich are sometimes of considerable value and which no doubt swell the import values,  (d) imports by parcels post are not distinguished as to the class of articles in our Trade Returns and are, therefore, not included under the ordinary import headings. The Applicants suggested that the goods covered by this application are particularly well adapted to be sent by parcels post, and we are Inclined to agree with them that, especially for the Christmas trade, there must be a considerable importation by this means.2. Vfe have obtained particulars of the export to this country of  this type of goods (mainly leather or artificial leather receptacles) from Germany, which is the only substantial country of origin, both in 1913 and in the years since the War, These are shown in weights as well as in values but it has been pointed out to us that the articles sold to-day would probably weigh considerably less and cost considerably more than those
1 igoods on the market before the war, and that for this reason it would be unsafe to take weights as an absolute standard any more than values.We attach at the end of the Report tables relating to fancy leather goods extracted from our own Trade Returns (Table I) and from the German Trade Returns (Table II). 18. In the second place we have found great difficulty in arriving at a standard   year for comparison for the purpose of deciding whether the imports now are abnormal.   The applicants have throughout contended that 1921 should be taken as a normal year.    We should have some difficulty in regarding the year 1921 as a &apos;normal&apos; year from any point of view, but, if a year since the war is to be taken to stand for normal, we think that 1921 is at least as normal as any other.      On the other hand the contention of the Opposition was that 1913 should be the basis for comparison both on the ground that there has so far been no strictly &apos;normal&apos; year since the war, and on the ground that the fancy leather industry was in existence in this country before the war, and they contend that even if the industry is mainly post war here, it is not poBt war in an international sense. 19. If the manufacture of light leather goods is to beregarded as a post war industry In Great Britain, and if we are to have regard only to the amount of such goods (including those of artificial leather) which are imported into this country now compared with 1921, the imports may certainly be considered to be abnormal, but we have thought it right to give weight to the following considerations.1. It is clear that the manufacture of ladies&apos; handbags is almost entirely a post war trade in this country, but the application does not relate only to ladies&apos; handbags, ar-d it is equally
clear that there was a well established, though small industry in other light leather goods in this country before the War. In view, therefore, of the fact that both the imports and the British production cover articles which were made in this country before the War, it is difficult in our opinion to consider the imports now entirely without regard to what they were in 1913.2. The imports from Germany which is the main country of origin (see Table II) have not reached anything like their pre-war dimensions in weight, and, in spite of the admittedly large expansion of the market compared with 1913, are still only 75 per cent, of their value in that year.3, Even had the imports proved to be abnormal in themselves this, In our opinion, would not, without having regard to the course of British production in the same period, have been conclusive evidence of abnormal competition in view of the expansion of the market for these goods in the relevant years. The Applicants did not suggest that the imports of these goods are anything like as large as the British output&quot;&quot;&quot;, but simply that the proportion of retained imports to production is steadily increasing, and we have no doubt that the German manufacturers have been regaining a portion of their former trade.    On the other hand the aggregate turnover of the six firms who produced their Trading Accounts to the Committee, a statement of which is set out below, and which should, we think, be a fairly reliable guide to the general course of the industry shows an advance of six per cent,  in 1925 compared with 1921.    There is no doubt that there has been an expansion of the market for these goods since that time, but on the other hand it was estimated that costs of production had fallenootnote.    According to their own estimate of production here the retained imports amounted in 1925 to 21.4 per cent, of the British output.
in this period, both as regards wages and as regards raw materials.Turnover of the six firms who produced balance sheets.1921......................... 339,2461922 ......................... 352,6761923 ......................... 337,8141924 .......... ............... 351,9161925 ......................... 360,51720. In all the circumstances -&apos;e have come to the conclusionthat while imports are steadily growing they are not abnormal within the meaning of the White Paper.(5) &quot;Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom&quot;.21. The elucidation of this question has been somewhatcomplicated owing partly to the nature of the industry and partly to the view taken by the applicants of the meaning to be put upon the word &apos;similar&apos; as applied to the products of this particular industry.22. In the first place it was clear that the applicantsconsidered that the competition of low grade with higher class articles was competition of a kind which ought to be recognised by this Committee as competition of similar articles within the meaning of the above section provided the two articles were of the same general type.    Thus it was urged that the British Manufacturer makes an expensive leather article, and that this article is copied by the foreigner in much cheaper material (whether artificial leather or cheap real leather) so cutting out the more expensive article.    Indeed two witnesses admitted that they did not complain of the foreigner being able to make
their articles cheaper hut of his copying their articles in very much inferior stuff and thus &quot;spoiling&apos;  the market for the more expensive article.    We were invited to treat artificial leather imports as competing with leather goods both for the reason given above and because artificial leather is in fact substituted for real leather value for value.      It was clear from the evidence that artificial leather is to a small extent  1 passed off as real leather, and that perhaps 25 per cent.of the artificial leather sold displaces the real leather article, the other 75 per cent, being bought on account of price.    We are satisfied that artificial leather does affect the fancy leather trade, but the production of artificial leather goods is not confined to foreign countries, and a duty would not protect the manufacturers of real leather goods from this competition \n so far as it comes from British Makers.    It was shown by the Opponents, who produced samples, that a manufacturer who had devoted himself to the production of artificial leather goods on a large scale in this country was able to do so profitably in competition with Germany and is increasing his business in It.    At the present time the large majority of manufacturers in this country do not appear to have endeavoured to compete with the foreigner to any great extent In the manufacture of artificial leather or very cheap quality leather goods, and for the most part stated that they did not care to touch this line of goods.23. We are of opinion that if the market demands the lower grade goods while British Manufacturers only produce the higher class articles, such competition cannot be considered to be competition of Similar&apos; articles within the meaning of the White Paper.
24. Eliminating the competition referred to above therestill remains, a good deal cf difficulty In obtaining strictly comparable samples.    We fully appreciate the fact that the comparability of samples in a trade in which novelty in design is admittedly a first essential must necessarily be one of general quality and type rather than of absolute similarity, but we are of opinion that the applicants should have produced samples of their own lines and of the corresponding German article of the same general type and quality (though not necessarily of exactly similar design) which was in every day competition with them on the British market and then demonstrated that the latter was able to undersell the former. We cannot see that there should have been any difficulty in doing this, but the evidence of the applicants on this point was most unconvincing.    It was clear from the evidence that the Germans cannot compete with us in high class real leather goods which incidentally, we are able to sell very successfully in competition with the Germans in the United States Market where quality is highly valued and where price is not as a rule a deciding factor to the extent it is in Europe.    It was also apparent from the evidence as stated above that Artificial Leather Goods can be profitably produced in this country in competition with the imported article.25. The m6-j.ority of the evidence related to medium and low class leather goods.    The applicants produced samples of these which may in many cases have been bought under exceptional circumstances and then proceeded to produce an English sample made for the purpose of the Inquiry.    Apart from the consideration before mentioned, viz. that the German sample was not in the majority of cases proved to be a line of regularly Imported goods, it was frequently apparent that
9 his hithe foreign and British samples were not strictly comparable, the English article being in most cases superior.    In the case of one manufacturer who did produce comparable samples and was able to prove satisfactorily that the bulk of his type of goods sold on this market was of foreign origin it was clear that a considerable part of the value of the article concerned consisted of movable fittings which were not made by him.26. Moreover, very convincing evidence was produced showing that the largest buyer of real leather fancy goods in this country was able to make 87 to 90 per cent. of his purchases from British manufacturers as cheaply as or even more cheaply than he could have done from foreign houses, and another buyer stated that he bought a large proportion of his fancy leather goods in this country.27. Having regard to the evidence of more than one substantialbuyer in this country as to the percentage of British goods in competition with foreign which they are able to buy, and having regard also to the fact that the evidence of samples produced has not satisfied us that fancy leather goods of the kind covered by this enquiry cannot be produced profitably at competitive prices in this country, we are of opinion that the applicants have not made out their case under this head of the White Paper.(4)  &quot;Whether, by reason of the severity and extent of &quot;such competition, employment in the manufacture or &quot;production of such goods in the United Kingdom is being, or flis likely to be, seriously affected&quot;,28. There are no official returns of employment and unemploy-ment in this industry owing to the fact that the Ministry of Labour Gazette includes under a single heading &quot;Saddlery, Harness and other leather goods manufacture&quot;.   The applicants claim not so much that there is a great deal
of unemployment in the industry at the present time as that there is serious under-employment in the earlier months of the year, and that, owing to the unsatisfactory condition of the industry, large numbers of persons have left the trade.     On the latter point, they relied upon their estimated summary before referred to, and upon a calculation relating to the Saddlery and Harness, heavy leather and light leather industries together based upon the return of the Census of Occupation 1921 and the Ministry of Labour Returns of insured workers under this head for July, 1925.   We are unable, as has been before indioated, to place much reliance upon the figures contained in the applicants  summary, but we have examined the second calculation suggested by the Applicants, and we find that, on this basis, employment In the three industries manufacturing leather referred to above has dropped from round about 30,000 in 1921 to some 26,000 in 1925. 29. With regard to the suggestion that there Is a large amountof under-employment in this trade, it appears to us that this is a necessary feature of the particular industry- which is admittedly a seasonal one, and that the same would probably be true of the German factories - the Applicants admitted, moreover, that there was no unemployment or under-employment in the busy season, viz. three or four months before Christmas, and that a considerable amount of overtime is worked in those months.30. The Opponents submitted a list of advertisements forfancy leather goods workers extraoted from the recognised papers, in London and in Birmingham and Walsall extending throughout the year October 1925 to October 1926,, and suggested, in the first place, that if the trade was advertising for hands throughout the year there could not be much unemployment, and, in the second place, that there was a scarcity of skilled labour
id 4in the industry.    We do not attach too much importance to these advertisements, the trade being a seasonal one, but on the other hand we do think that they afforded evidence of a scarcity of skilled labour in this industry a oircumstance which was admitted by Applicant witnesses who stated it to be due to the bad prospects held out by the trade.There- was some evidence that the industry in this country is considerably handicapped by the competition of goods at cut prices made under sweated conditions of labour by so-called 1 garret workers&apos;, the light leather industry being particularly well adapted to this kind of enterprise by reason of the small amount of capital and machinery needed in manufacture,.    We are satisfied that there are a considerable number of such garret workers in this country, and we think it probable that at least a numbar of persons recorded as having left the trade are employed in this way or have set up for themselves on a very small scale.    It is also clear to us, and was admitted in evidence,.that a proportion of those who have left the trade must have left it in order to go to other trades, and it&apos; appears to us that this would be particularly likely to happen where the industrs^ is seasonal.    We do not consider that the fact of persons having left the trade to follow other occupa-tions can be regarded as unemployment, but the fact that their places have not been taken by.others is, we think, evidence that employment has been seriously affected in this trade since the high water mark during and immediately after the war.    While this may be due in part to foreign firms regaining a part of their pre-war market in this type of goods, we think that it is mainly due to the failure, here as in Germany, of the &quot;mushroom&apos;&apos; firms which sprang up in large numbers in both countries in the period following the war and were financially too weak to stand the long ,trade depression.    This view is1,5.
borne out by the fact that of the six firms who gave us detailed returns of employment only two show a decrease in employment comparing 1921 and 1925, the other four having increased it in smaller or larger percentages, and that the applicants informed us that the aggregate figures of employment of the 27 firms who made returns to the Accountant had increased from 2,326 in 1921 to 2,458 in 1925.(5) &quot;Whether such exceptional competition comes largely &quot;from countries where the conditions are so different from &quot;those in this country as to render the competition unfair. &quot;Competition&quot; for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be &quot;deemed to be unfair unless it arises from one or more of the &quot;following causes:&quot;(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to create an export bounty: &quot;(b) Subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages: &quot;(c) Unfair conditions of employment of labour whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment or otherwise obtaining amongst the persons employed in the production of the imported goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the production of similar goods in the United Kingdom. &quot;In making their Report upon the alleged unfairness of the &quot;competition the Committee may call attention to any special &quot;circumstances by reason of which in their opinion the &quot;Industry in the United Kingdom is placed at a serious &quot;relative disadvantage&quot;.It was clear to us from the outset  that the only sub-stantial competition comes from Germany, the imports from other countries in this class of goods being unimportant in
comparison.    We nave, therefore, limited our remarks to the conditions stated by the Applicants to be &quot;unfair&quot; in so far as they apply to Germany.33. (a) The German currency is now of course stabilised, butthe applicants attempted to show that the difference between the internal and external value of the mark operates so as to create an export bounty, the difference involved being roughly as between Is.3d. and Is.    While recognising that the German manu-facturer derives some advantage from being able to sell without loss for Is. what he makes for Is.3d., we are of opinion that this advantage is to some extent balanced by the admitted fact that he has to buy the greater part of his raw material in sterling, this country being the European market for undressed leather.34. (b) The Applicants suggested that differences in theburden of rates and taxes and social insurance should be taken account of by the Committee under this head.    We do not consider that Imperial taxation can be regarded, as a direct tax upon industry but we agree that local rates and social insurance may be so considered.    We think, however, that any estimate by us of the comparative burdens which fall upon the British and German manufacturers from these charges must be so hypothetical as to be valueless for the purposes of this enquiry. There was no other evidence worth recording of subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages. 35. (c) The Applicants at first suggested that the conditionsof labour in Germany, as compared with those here,
were inferior both as regards wages and as regards hours of labour.    Subsequently they withdrew their suggestions with regard to hours and concentrated upon.wages, basing their comparisons throughout upon minimum rates for each country, &quot;it being understood that higher wages are paid for skill and other qualifications in both countries.    They were able to show that in Offenbach wages per hour are considerably lower than in this country, especially, those for men, and that, even taking into account, the contention of the Opposition (which was disputed by the Applicants)  that in Germany two men are employed to one woman as against two women to one man here, the wage cost to the Manufacturer is higher here than in Germany. While, however, the German agreement is binding upon allfEmployers and enforceable by law, the-English Agreements (of which there are two, one in the Midlands and one in London) are only binding upon Employers who are Members of the Association. Moreover the English agreements, which are set out in very much less detail than the German, make no provision for overtime rates although a good quantity of overtime is worked, and while we were informed that some employers pay time and a quarter it was also admitted that others pay no overtime rates at all - in Germany there are fixed overtime rates.    Again, although it was stated in evidence that an increasing number of juveniles are employed in this country, apparently the only rates fixed for juveniles in either of the British agreements are those18.
C-j Lifor female juveniles in Birmingham.    It was also pointed out that, contrary to the general practice in this country, in Germany where a man&apos;s work is done by a woman or skilled work by an unskilled worker wages have to be paid on the higher basis.   Quite apart from other considerations it is to be remembered that any unfairness In wage costs could apply only to the minor portion of the cost of produotion of these articles, the greater part consisting of materials, which, in the case of real leather articles, have to be bought by the German firms largely in this country. In all the circumstances considered above, we are not satisfied that the conditions in Germany either of employment of labour or in respect of the other matters discussed are so different from those in this country as to render the . -competition -unfair.(6) &quot;Whether the applicant industry is being carried on &quot;in this country with reasonable efficiency and economy&quot;.In view of the fact that the efficiency of the British industry was never seriously questioned we have not thought it necessary to go Into this question in detail, but, upon the evidence before us, we have no doubt that the firms ?/ho were represented before us conduct their business efficiently and economically(7) &quot;Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the olass or description in question would exert a seriously adversi effect on employment in any other industry being an industry using goods of that class or description in production&quot;.
38. Our answer to this question is No.    We have had no evidence of any other industry requiring or using these goods in the production of their own articles.(8) &quot;Whether having regard to the above conditions, the applicant industry has, in the opinion of the Committee established a claim to a duty, and if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition&quot;.39. In view of our findings under Sections 2, 3 and 5 we areunanimously agreed that the applicants have failed to establish their claim to a duty.3. METAL FRAMES LOCKS AND CLASPS FOR BAGS AND OTHER RECEPTACLES40. The Committee sat for one and a half days, and hearda certain amount of evidence in the Metal Fittings enquiry. It was admitted by the Applicants that the number of persons employed in the whole trade in 1922 (which they took as their normal year for purposes of comparison) was 1973 and in 1925,  1298, and upon that evidence we arrived at the ,clear conclusion that the industry is not of substantial importance by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods concerned.    It was       equally clear that there is nothing in the nature of the goods produced to render the industry one of substantial importance on that account. Having come to this conclusion upon.a condition which is fundamental to the establishment of a claim for a safeguarding duty, although we see no reason to doubt that the industry in this country is efficiently managed, we closed the enquiry, on the ground that the Applicants had failed to make out a case under
Section II (l) of the White Paper.In conclusion we desire to record our grateful appreciation of the services of our Secretary who by her exceptional ability and industry has considerably lightened our labours.(Sgd.)
