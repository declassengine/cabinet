g E COPY NO.12(27 ) . .   ...   CABINET. 1 &apos;ibRED SEA LIGHTS.Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to tho Treasury. (Previous Paper:    CP.Ifg7 ) ).The Memorandum circulated by the President of the Board of Trade was not seen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer before he went  abroad, and. as it is possible that it may come before the Cabinet for consideration before the Chancellor returns to England,  I may perhaps be permitted tc explain how the question of the Red Sec Lights presents itself to the Treasury.So far as the facts of the case are concerned I agree generally with the statemen4&quot; contained in the President Ts memorandum; but it is remarkable that while he &quot;entirely agrees with  the Treasury that the cost Is not one which they ought to bear&quot;, he  seeks Cabinet authority for fastening that cost for an indefinite period on tho Exchequer.    The reason he gives for this startling contradiction is that &quot;the consequence of extinguishing the Lights will be so serious&quot; that he cannot bring himself to contemplate it.    What is this serious consequence?     The  answer apparently is that &quot;these lights are necessary for navigation&quot;.      But .in this connection the President  of the Board of Trade makes one very noteworthy omission from the history of the case - the omission, namely, of the date when these lights which are necessary for navigation first were seen in the Red Sea.      They were in fact erected in 1003;  but I believe tho Red Sea was navigated in the nineteenth century,  and even in earlier
tines, without being in any special degree- notorious as the scone of shipwrecks..      The President of the Board of Trade seems to bo particularly apprehensive lest an American or other foreign vessel should in consequence of the discontinuance of the lights run ashore; but I entirely fail to understand what obligation rests upon the British taxpayer to maintain lights on non-British territory for the special benefit of foreign shipping, seeing that,  as the President admits, he is under no obligation to provide lights on our own coasts or anywhere else for general navigation.      The  cost of lighting the coast of this country,  and of certain Colonial Lights, is in fact met out of light duos paid by shipowners into the General lighthouse Fund.    There is  only one admitted exception to this rule, namely the Llatnnilla Shoal (off the coast of Florida), which is altogether peculiar, and is irrelevant to the case of the Sod Sec Lights. The cost of maintaining the Red Sea lights was first borne by tho Exchequer as a war measure, and the Treasury has never admitted that there was anything which would justify the maintenance of the lights at the public expense in peace time.    They have however refrained until recently from enforcing this view,  in deference to the desire of the Beard of Trade to keep the lights working until a scheme for their maintenance could bo devised; and tho President in the concluding words of his memorandum, speaks of such a scheme as a. vague possibility in some indefinite  future -She main obstacle to the revising of such a scheme was removed by the conclusion of the Treaty of Lausanne In 1923.      The Treasury nevertheless allowed over two years to pass before announcing its decision last April and even
then ell owed a period of grace of nearly a year before the care of the lights at the public expense was to be abandoned.      Luring the whole of this tine no real progress towards a solution soeras to here boon maae,  and it is quite impossible to give any aarui-t.ir.ee to tho taxpayer that if he will provide the money to maintain the lights until a stated date, he will then be definitely relieved of the charge.British shipowners do not endorse the view of the Board of Trade that these lights are essential to navigation, for their x^presentatives admitted, at a. conference held last Augus&quot;;, that &quot;while they did not want the lights to go out, navigation would still continue even if the lights did go out, and the shipowners would be prepared, if necessary, to face this possibility&quot;.As regards tho strategic value of the; lights, the Admiralty have admitted that this aspect of the natter-is not of sufficient importance to  justify them in bringing the-, question before the Committee of Imperial Defence.So far therefore from shipowners, whether-foreign or British, having any grievance if the taxpayer refuse^ any longer t o pay for tho upkeep of these lighthouses, the truth is that tho Government is entitled to take credit for having maintained them for eight years since the war free; of expense to shipowners.
For these reasons,I strongly disagree with the President&apos;s cor elusion that there is no real alternative to our continuing to pay for those lights from the Exchequer until v?e can bring into operation a workable scheme for placing the  cost on the passing ships.      ho such scheme,  I feel sure, will ever materialise unless and until the Government shows that no ores sure will persuade them to continue placing the burden on the general   taxpayer.If challenged to suggest an alternative,  I would mention a comparatively simple solution of the difficulty which the Treasury has repeatedly put forward, but which has so far been rejected by the shipowners and is not referred to in the President&apos; s memorandum.      This is that the lights should be maintained after Larch next out of the General Lighthouse Fund.      The revenue of this fund is contributed as to about two-thirds by  British Shipping and as to one-third by foreign shipping, - a proportion which, as it happens,  corresponds closely to the proportion of British and foreign tonnage passing through the Suez Canal.This solution should satisfy the objection of British shipowners to undertaking a burden which is not shared proportionately by those foreign shipowners&apos;who also benefit from the maintenance of the lights,.      The  ground on which the shipowners have rejected it appears to he  that it would oblige,  e.g. the owners of Atlantic liners to contri-bute to the cost of lights from which they derived no benefit,        It Is difficult to sympathise with tills objection,  which is simply the revival of an obsolete argument that was disposed of by the establishment in 1898 of the General Lighthouse Fund,  to which (so far as concerns the maintenance  of all British and a  number  of Colonial Lights)
shipowners contribute upon the basis of flat rates per  ton per voyage (hone-trade or foreign-going), irrespective of the particular lights passed by particular ships.This solution vould, however, require legislate, cn j and I would not suggest that a. Bill should be introduced until the principle had been agreed with the ship-owners.    So far they have rejected it;    but it is possible that, if the President informed them that he now had the authority of the Cabinet to extinguish the lights on the 1st April next, they might change their attitude.      The Treasury, however, strongly urge that if there should be any delay in reaching   . an agreement on this point, no further postponement of the Treasury instructions be permitted.      The Treasury claim that under the circumstances related above they have acted with exemplary patience in authorising the continuance of the charge on the Exchequer until the 31st of I-arch next, and they trust that the Cabinet will decide that no  extension of this date can he allowed.      If, after that, the ship-owners, both British and foreign,  are in earnest in wishing that the lights be maintained, we shall be in a far stronger position for negotiating a satisfactory settlement;  if, however, there is no serious demand for the resumption of the service,  it may be concluded that its maintenance is not of vital necessity.R.Lie IT.Trea sury Chambers , S. i/ .1.
