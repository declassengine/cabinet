Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 20th December, 1926, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 11&apos;9, as compared with 13&apos;5 at the 22nd November, 1926, with 10&quot;4 at the 21st December, 1925, and with 10&quot;7 at the 22nd December, 1924. The figures at the 20th December in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

Owing to the cessation of blast-furnace work during the coal strike, it appears that an acute shortage of pig iron exists in most areas.   To meet this shortage, production has50,000. In the result, the total reduction of unemployment during the period was 145,022. Notwithstanding this decrease, the figure for the 24th December was still 369,168 in excess of that for the 26th April, 1926, i.e., immediately before the strike, and greater by 248,645 than the figure for the corresponding date in December 1925.
been accelerated with the result that in some areas there are now more blast furnaces in operation than in the period before the coal dispute. Similarly a shortage of tin plates accounts for the marked increase in activity in this trade. The increased output of pig iron, and the greater availability of fuel supplies in general, has made possible a further improvement in Iron and Steel and in General Engineering, in which trades it is repoited that orders are plentiful. In Shipbuilding, in most districts an increased amount of work is in hand, and it is probable that a more marked recovery would have taken place but for a difficulty in obtaining constructional material. It must not be forgotten, however, that a wholesale improvement on a much greater scale will be necessary before employ-men t in these industries can become anything like normal. On the 20th December, 1926, the percentage of unemployment in pig-iron manufacture was 44&apos;7 per cent.; in iron and steel, 34&quot;5 per cent.; in tin plate, 22 per cent.; in General Engineering, 15&apos;7 per cent., and in Shipbuilding, 42&apos;2 per cent.The industry showing the greatest reduction in unemployment during December was the Cotton trade. This reduction is to be attributed to the desire of manufacturers to accelerate output prior to the Christmas holidays rather than to any definite change for the better in the Cotton position. It would appear from the latest information available that the improvement has not been maintained. Increased employment in the Woollen industry is partly accounted for by seasonal causes which are also responsible for the improvement in the Distributive trades.The principal industries in which increased unemployment is reported during the month are building and coal mining. The increase in building is stated to be due to seasonal slackness together with a shortage of materials. In coal mining the position is still a little obscure. It is reported that during December substantial progress was made in the reabsorption of colliery workers following the termination of the dispute, but in some areas, Wigan, for example, considerable numbers of miners still remain out of work.In attempting to estimate the extent to which the reduction in unemployment, which took place last month reflects a genuine improvement in the industrial position, it is necessary to bear in mind that December is normally a month in which a seasonal decline in unemployment takes place. There are indications, however, that in the past month the initial steps towards industrial recovery have made their appearance. From the latest industrial reports available, it would appear that prospects in most of the larger trades are satisfactory, for some months ahead at least, but that immediate progress is likely to be hindered by a scarcity of basic materials.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 10th January, giving the total number on the registers as 1,432,014. This is an increase over the position on the 24th December amounting to 80,969, and an increase over a year ago of 210,611. The preliminary figure for the 17th January is 1,391,000, showing a decrease in one week of 41,014.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,January 25, 1927.
