THIS DOCIMX&amp;T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S ,SECRSTj. COPY NO.    -i QCABINET.POOR LAW REFORM,.Redraft of 2nd paragraph of draft Circular to Associations of Local Authorities.Memorandum, by the Minister of HealthyWith reference to Cabinet Conclusion of the 2nd instant (C.5 (27) 5d) and to my memorandum CP. 30 (27) of the 3lBt ultimo, I attach a redraft of paragraph 2 of the circular latter to the Associations of local authorities appended to that memorandum.I now desire authority to circulate the draft Poor Law Reform Bill forthwith for the views of the Associations.       Before this is done, a deoision is required-on the two points specifically mentioned in my previous memorandum, viz (l) disqualification of persons for&apos;the municipal franchise on the ground of receipt of poor relief (Clause 18 and Fourth Schedule of the Bill), and (2) repeal of the Boards of Guardians (Default) Act, 1926 (concluding paragraph of the memorandum).N.C.3rd FebruaryT 1927.
KBDRAiET.2. The draft Bill does not include any provision giving effect to the scheme of financial reform which, formed part of the Provisional Proposals circulated to Local Authorities.     The reason is that H.M, Government are now considering a wider scheme of financial reform which would include provision for other aor-vices besides Health and would take the form of a single grant covering all the services included as well as the Assigned Revenues.     Further discussion with Local Authorities would in any case precede the formulation of any specific proposals arising out of this consideration.
