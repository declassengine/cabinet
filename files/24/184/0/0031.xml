The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.February 8, 1927.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. The League of Nations has been strengthened and a further step taken towards the restoration of normal international relations in Europe by the entry of Germany into the League and her appointment to a permanent seat on the Council of the League. In continuation of this policy, it was found possible at the end of last month to terminate the system of Allied military control in Germany as set up by the Treaty of Versailles and to hand over to the League all questions affecting the military clauses of the Treaty.The continuation of civil war in China and the anti-foreign and particularly the anti-British agitation by which it has been accompanied have caused Me grave anxiety. In consequence of what happened at Hankow and in other places, My Government have felt it necessary to despatch to the Far Bast a sufficient force to protect the lives of My British and Indian subjects against mob violence and armed attack. But I earnestly desire a peaceful settlement of the difficulties which have arisen, and My Government have caused proposals to be made to the Chinese authorities which should convince public opinion in China and throughout the world that it is the desire of the British people to remove all real grievances, to renew Our treaties on an equitable basis, and to place Our future relations with the Chinese people on a footing of friendship and goodwill.My Government will maintain Our traditional policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of China.I rejoice that a fair and friendly settlement has been reached regarding the funding of the War Debt due to this country by Portugal.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the Public Services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,There are, I am happy to note, encouraging signs of improvement in the state of trade and industry. [ earnestly pray that those engaged in the various industries of the country will use their utmost endeavours to ensure that the improvement in the volume of employment among My people, which may now be reasonably anticipated, will not be arrested by industrial strife.Proposals will be laid before you at an early date to enable effect to be given to the change in the style and titles of the Sovereign to which, on the recommendation of the Imperial Conference, I have given My approval. At the same time you will be invited to make consequential alterations in the title of Parliament.Recent events have made evident the importance of defining and amending the law with reference to industrial disputes. Proposals for this purpose will be laid before you.Proposals will also be made for an amendment of the law relating to leasehold premises so as to secure to an outgoing tenant compensation for the loss of his goodwill and unexhausted improvements.Bills in connection with Agriculture will be laid before you.(15722)
You will be invited to pass a measure dealing with Insurance against Unemployment.A Bill to encourage the production and exhibition of British films will be presented to you. . . .Proposals for the amendment of the Companies Acts will be introduced to your notice.Proposals will also be submitted to you for the reorganisation of certain of the Departments in Scotland.Other important measures, as the time of the Session permits, will be introduced to your notice ; and I pray that your deliberations may, under the Divine blessing, result in the happiness and contentment of My people.
