37 1TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.ret Copy Ncu 3&amp; -; 55(27)WASHINGTON    HOURS    CONVENTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.It is desirable that the Cabinet should reach a decision as to the policy to be adopted by this country in relation to the Washington Hours Convention.     The general history of the  question will be in the minds of my colleagues and I need only at this stage remind the Cabinet that,  after considering the situation as it existed throughout 1925, it was decided that the British Government should invite the Ministers of Labour of France, Germany, Italy and Belgium to confer with me with a view to seeing how far it wqs possible (a) to overcome the difficulties due to the rigidity of the terms of the Washington Convention, and. (b) to enter into an agreement with the Governments of the four countries as to simultaneous ratification,   The issue of the invitation was taken to indicate that the British Government would consider favourably the question of ratification if the London Conference proved to be successful, and there is no doubt that, both on the Continent and at home, there is a feeling that this country became still more committed to action in the -direction of rati.fication,2.     The London Conference, after prolonged discussion, reached a considerable measure of agreement, subject to confirmation by the respective Governments.     There has 3ince been formal ratification by 3elgium;    Italy had already ratified, subject to ratification by certain other countries;    in Prance provisional/ratifIcBtion
ratification has just been approved by the Seriate subject to ratification by Germany and Great Britain;    in Germany a Bill has been approved by the Cabinet and is under discussion and tho ne-.v Government have declared that they are prepared to ratify tho Convention,  subject to ratification by Great Britain and France.3.     When the Cabinet in April of last year considered the question of taking the next step following upon the London Conference, we were approached by the Employers&apos;  Confederation who showed themselves opposed to ratification.     Then came the coal  dispute, and no further consideration was given to the matter by the Cabinet.     From time to time daring last year Questions were  addressed to ivc in the House of Commons as to what aotion was proposed;    I replied that we were so pre-occupied with the industrial situation created by the general strike and the coal dispute that no decision had been reached.     Similar statements have been made from time to time by the 3ritish Government representatives at Geneva.4.     Already this Session questions are being put on this subject and it is  clear that,  having regard to the action taken by the Cabinet last year in regard to miners&apos;   hours, throughout this Session very great play will be made by the Opposition with the subject of hours of labour generally;    nor are we free from a certain amount of embarrassment on our own side - two out of the three questions that are already upon the Order Paper are from our own supporters.5.     M. Thomas,  the Director of the International Labour Office, who has just been in London, has said enough to me to make it plain that, in his view,  there is every likelihood that Great 3ritain will find herself presently in a position of/isolation.
isolation, provisional ratification having been agreed by the other four States, and Britain alone preventing a general European concordat on hours.    Ho has expressed to me the orinion that the opposition of the British employers shows signs of becoming less acute.    I do not know how far this may prove to bo the case, but I hope shortly to get some information about it.    I am considering how far it is possible to -rieet the employers&apos; view on one point to which they attach importance,   and which is,  I think, as a matter of fact, the only point about which they need have any fear, namely, the State control of overtime.6.      I hope that it is unnecessary for me to convince the Cabinet of tho importance of reaching a definite decision on this matter.    In my view cannot any longer temporise onthe ground that the circumstances here   are such that we cannot make up our minds.  .   In order that the matter may be examined, I suggest the  appointment of s small Committee of the Cabinet which might consult with me and report to the Cabinet.(Intd.) A. S. - M.Mi nist ry of La bo ur . 14th February, 19S7.
