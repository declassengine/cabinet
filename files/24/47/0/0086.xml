I have  sent  a letter to the           Minister of National Service with regard to the  point           mentioned in the fourth  paragraph.                               (Signed)  K.  P. A.

Copy of letter from Mr,  raems Thomson    to tho Secretsryi war Cabinet,Ministry of Shipping,    St. j!:raes&apos;s Park,        LONDON, S.r.1.                                             8th April, 1918.Eesr Hankey,      I am off to America  to-d; y ind  think  it d9sirabl3 &quot;beforeleaving to let you know briefly my views about the possibilitiesof shipping- reinforcements from U.3.A.      The question of seeing that American  Infantry is &quot;veliableto fill any ships v/hieh we ;;nd our Allies are able to provideI am taking for $ranted, -:nd consider that  that side of thematter is safe in General Hutchison1s hands.      The .&apos;.dmirtlty have been helping me to  the fu.l, and havearranged to take the risk of reducing the minimum speed requiredfor troop transport from 13-1 Knots to 9  knots, thus renderinga number of additional ships available.  The numbers carried inthe slower steamers baing of course restricted.      They hf-ve also cu&apos;*r?;.ntoed with  the consent of the ShippingController absolute priority during the nei:t four months fortroop fitting so far.es ca.riod out in this  country over everyother description of merchant ship vork.  The utmost efforts orebeing made to reduce drastically the  time occupied in port bythe troop ships on both sides of the Atlantic, end additionallabour is boin;. provided in the ports to meet the emergency.I cannot too strongly emphasise the point that it is vital tothe success of the schemo that no men po*;;er essential to thequick turn round o2 vessels in the ports should bo withdrawn.I consider that instruction should be 6.iven  at once to theMinistry of ii&amp;tional Service that no such step should be takenwithout the prior consent of the Shirring Controller.      Exhausting all possibilities, not only in shipping butin port and labour facilities, snd assuming  oho Americans ore asgood as their word, I think tho estimate of 120,000 men toembark in April is safe.  From the end of April onwardb thereshould be steady progress, reaching a maximum in the month ofJune when I am aiming at emb--.rkin  a total of  00,000 AmericanInfantry in tonn- go of all nationalities combined.  I believethat this can bo done, end no effort on the -nart of my ?ssistartson both sides of the ;-.tlontio -?nd myself will bo spared to do it.At the s-rmo timo in view of the mairy uncertain f-ctors in the^roblom I am not in a position to  ivo a definite pledge thatthese figures will be attained.                                Yours sivrcoreiy,
