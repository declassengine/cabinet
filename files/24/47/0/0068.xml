L0HDG1L       lote by Lord Liilner.,     Reports continue to reach us from reliable  sources,  that  thoGermans have boon greatly upset by the bombing of their towns.Under these  circumstances it scorns almost certain that thoy  willretaliatec    V/e know that thoy have tho means of making an attackon London on a  much greater scale than any hitherto attomptod,Tlioir very  quiescence during the last few weeks  is suspicious.,  Itwould be in  accordance with all their methods to abstain  from  minordemonstrations  if they are preparing a big attack,     I suggest  that the Cabinet should inquire what we arc doing toprepare for  such a contingency.   The Air hinistxy disclaim  anyresponsibility  for the defence of London,   I believe it  is  leftentirely to  lord French, and undor him to General iishmoro.   Oughtthat  officer not to be called upon for a report, or, better  still,dg asked to  attend the Cabinet at an early date, in order that we  ly know what progress has been made in this matter latterly andmay satisfy  ourselves that everything possible is being done ?                                  f Initialled),Whitehall  Gardens,  S*\7a7th April,  1918,
