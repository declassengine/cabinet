Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.April  8th,  1916.AUSTRIA/OOl.             REVOhfelCHARY  FORGES  IK  AUSTRIA.     1,   A  continuance  of  the  war threatens Austria --pith internaldisaster.    But Germany  demands it, and Germany1 s  military powerand victories alone  stand between Austria and revolution.   This?is the reason why the Austrian  government continually oscillatesbetween pacifism and &quot;Bundestreue&quot;.   &quot;Revolution  does not destroygovernments, hut triumphs after government has broker down,1&apos; or-yeSorel in his work on the French Revolution.    In Austria peoplehave lost faith not  in the  government alone, which has proved bothinefficient  and oppressive,  but in the State itself.   With the- - -exception of the German Kationalists who constitute merely one-fifthof the  Reichsrat,  every single party has repeatedly refused toshare the responsibility for governing Austria.   &quot;The crisis is notin the  government,,  but in the State (nioht eine Re.?ierungs- aber eineStaatskrise)&quot;,  writes  the Vienna correspondent of the &quot;FrankfurterZeitun/t&apos;,  one of the bext-informed men in Austria.   &quot;She factremains that a majority of the Austrian nationalities and of theirrepresentatives are against  the State as now constituted.&quot;   Austriacannot  continue on its present basis, but it is not within the power-either  of the Emperor  or of  any Austrian government to satisfy thedemands for.  change.    Those  of the non-German nationalities go beyondthe frontiers of Austria,  those of the Austrian-German Socialistsbeyond  the limits of capitalist society *    These two groups have to-gether  a majority in the Austrian Parliament, and the socialistdoctrine of  complete national self-determination supplies a linkbetween them, not for  opposition alone, but also for action.    TheAustrian government, on the  other hand, unable to And any possiblebasis .lor compromise,  has to rely on the German bourgeois partieswhich reject all idea  of compromise and look towards Berlin,  and is
 incapable  0,.  evolving  any policy of its ovm.      2.&apos;.  Bolshevism is  visibly growing among the German Socialists in Austria.    In  October 1916  Friedrich Adler was the only Bolshevik among them, painfully  conscious of his complete isolation-.   At Ms trial in the  spring  op 1917  he spo&amp;e with bitterness o\  the Austrian-German Socialist party ana rated it for aliening itself to be led  by  a German  Jingo  such as Pernerstorfor or an Austrian. imperialist such  as  Rennerr.  he attacked its party organ, the &quot;Arbeiter  Zeitung&quot;,  saying that foreign politics are discussed in it daily by an &quot;Offiziosus  der  Wilhelmstrasse&quot; (Leuthner).    But now the &quot;Arbeiter Zeituny&apos;1 openly  declare:; its sympathy with theI Bolshevik  Revolution and bitterly criticises the German counter- revolutionary expeditions into Finland and the Ukraine    An old moderate leader such as  WiltLelrn Ellenbogen hails the Bolshevik. Revolution in public speeches, and all alike defend it from the accusations raised against it.   &quot;The Vienna working classes know what to  think of  the campaign  of calumny against the Bolsheviks; they recognise in it the campaign of calumny against their own history.&quot;  &quot;&quot;Possibly the Russian Revolution will succumb to a world of enemies  united  against it in spite of dividing trenches: yet its  history will proclaim  to the wojfcld what a powerful advance the proletariat has  made since 1348,  how its strength has in-II creased&quot; (Arbeiter Zeitunp::  on March 13-  the 70th anniversary of                          v.,                      ,            f the revolution of 1848)&apos;.   It  is hardly possible to obtain -exactI information about the  subterranean movements among the working1 classes  in Austria     But the  chanae in the attitude of  the eldI leaders  speaks volumes.    These men are mostly bourgeois by ex-I traction, as well  as  in their thinking,  and they are obviously dragged  towards the  Left by  forces from below.      3-    Information  obtained from Russia points  to a growing disorganisation in the Austrian army:  circumstantial evidence which
can be gathered from the Austrian press bears out this  contention.In a Galician district town, Przemyslany, a deserter who hadassumed the rank of an officer was able ito establish an &quot;Etappen-kommando&quot; end to carry it on successfully for about, half a year.Looking through cases in the Law Courts one is  struck by thenumber of deserters who apparently are able to move about freely.The prisoners of war who are returning from Russia in enormousnumbers are certain to intensify the unrest and  disorganisation inthe army.   On reaching Austria they a re put for several weeksinto internment camps, largely with a view to &quot;political quarantine&quot;.&quot;The Army Command has been informed that anon&apos;;; the returningprisoners there Is a fairly considerable number of people won overby adherents of revolutionary ideas an-:&quot;- sent to make revolutionarypropaganda,&quot; said General von Czapp, the Austrian Minister for V/ar,in the Reichsrat on March 7.   &quot;I should like to add that these arenot mere surmises, but that we have proofs of such designs, and notisolated proofs only.&quot; - &quot;Assume that over there a man has becomea Bolshevik,&quot; said a Socialist speaker in answer to the Ministerfor War.   &quot;You don&apos;t know what that means.   But anyhow somethingdangerous.   The Austrian State has to be guarded against Bolshevism.......Ho&amp; is this to be done?   The men are shut up until they saythat they are not Bolsheviks.   A man  would be a blockhead whowould not assure the Minister for War that he is not a Bolshevikbut a true Austrian patriot and a devout brother in the Lord.&quot;     Possibly the Austrian authorities succeed in tracking, bymeans of espionage, a certain number of Bolsheviks.   One canhowever imagine what impression on the minds of the others is leftby that peculiar reception which they receive on their return home -the conditions in these camps are admittedly bad because no properprovision nak been made beforehand.     4.   On March 1 the Austrian Premier declared in the Reichsratin favour of solving the national problems by means of nationalautonomy, i.e. of national associations organised like churches on
- A. -a personal, and not on a territorial, basis.   He followed up thatdeclaration by practical proposals which are different for the Czechand for the Jugo-Slav provinces, in each case to suit the.Germaninterest,  and which nowhere admit a territorial administrative unionof any one nationality.   nothing was said about Galicia, for thefuture of that province is bound up with the Polish Question, forwhich no  final programme has as yet been put forward by the CentralPowers.   Since 1899 the German Socialists in Austria had advocatednational Wtonomy of which the theory has now been endorsed by thePremier.   Meanwhile however the Bolshevik Revolution has convertedits authors to the principle of national Statehood and national self-determination.   &quot;To each nation its own government and its ownparliament&quot; - such States must come into existence before widerunions can be formed.   &quot;Even the German bourgeois parties in theirblindness cannot imagine that they will be able to withhold from theCzechs the right to form a State of  their own (&quot;Arbeiter Zeitung&quot;&apos;,March 2,  1918).But the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs have repeatedlydeclared  that their territories included in Austria are not a sufficientbasis for their Statehood.   So far the official answers of the Czechsor Jugo-Slavs to the proposals of the Austrian Premier has notreached us, but their outlines are known.   They refuse to enter anyconference unless their programmes of March 30, 1917, are endorsedbeforehand -  and these programmes presuppose the disruption of bothAustria and Hungary and the reunion of all Czecho-Slovak and allJugo-Slav territories.   They will consequently declare that theirnational  problems cannot be settled in the Austrian Parliament, butonly in a wider conference of nations.   Meantime all Magyar partieshave become converted to the principle oi a separate Hungarian army -obviously a precaution against possible developments in Austria.     The  one  thing proved by the  constitutional discussions in theAustrian  Parliament is that the internal problems of Austria canbe solved not by constitutional means, but by revolution alone.The German bourgeoisie and, in certain contingencies, the Polish
nobility are the only elements in Austria on whose support theAustrian State can rely.   But the German Nationalists in Austria,the leaders of the- German bourgeoisie, take their cue from Berlin,speak of the need for victory an-1, demand that the war should bo con-tinued.   &quot;The Russian proletariat in the most elemental form hadto establish its dictatorship be-:ore the road to peace was open,&quot;answered a Socialist leader on March. 11 speaking at the graves ofthe victims of 1846.     5.   Just as in national matters,, the German Socialists inAustria have drawn nearer to the Slav nations, the Czechs, Jugo-Slavs and Ukrainians have drawn nearer to the Socialists by puttingforward most radical programmes of agrarian reform, which it was theeasier for them to do as the big landowners in the Czech and Jugo-Slav provinces are mainly Germans or nationally nondescript; inEast Galicia. Poles.   No doubt after a successful revolution thedifferences between Nationalists and Socialists would soon makethemselves felt as they have in the Ukraine between the Bolsheviksand the Rada.   But for the present the three movements in Austria -irredentist nationalisms, extreme Socialism amoii^ the industrialworking classes and the agrarian movement stimulated by the exampleof Russia and the Ukraine - are working in the same direction.There are only two dominant forces left in Eastern Europe, Germanmilitarism and Social revolution, and round these all the othersmust group themselves.     6.   The German working men in Austria begin to speak abouta dictatorship of the proletariat as the road to peace.   The Czechsare mobilised for revolution.   The Juao-Slavs are preparing.   InGalicia the peasantry has been exasperated by military requisitionsand the failure of the government to pay for Chem or to helpeffectively in the repair of war damages.     In Croatia martial law has been proclaimed.   Cracow andLemberg are entirely under police government.   According to dis-olosures made in the Reicns5*i on March 7 by a Polish Socialist.
                               - 6 -everything has been prepared for reintroducing martial lav/ andcourts martial in Galicia.  . Prince Sch&amp;iburg is said to h,,ve beenselected to lead the counter-revolution  (presumably as a militarydictator).   This is the same man who on February 28 as cnairmanof the Centre party in the Upper Hou^e,  severely criticise itsmember, Professor Lammasch* for his speech as disloyal to theGerman Alliance*     7.   On. February 22 the Austrian Premier declared that Austriavould net take part in the expeditioxi into the Ukraine.   Sixdays later the policy was reversed, avowedly in order to safeguard.food supplies and their transport against the Bolshevik bands inthe Ukraine.   According to the most recent information, so farfrom supplying food from the Ukraine, the Austrian army over therehas to be-supplied with food from Austria.  First the Austriangovernment feared to intervene in the Ukraine because of Socialistopposition; the reasons for the reversal of the policy were com-plex, but one of them was the desire to prevent the spreading ofthe agrarian movement to East Galicia by suppressing it in theadjoining Russian provinces.     8.   The German bourgeois parties demanded Austrian int^r-ventipn in the Ukraine - Germany v/as to be assisted, Austria vasto Participate in the &quot;Siegeszug&quot; and to raise thereby htrprestige.    The Socialists opposed it as war-like and counter-revolutionary, the Czechs and Jugo-Slav\? because it is anti-Russian, the Poles because they wish to see Ukrainian nationalismsuppressed, be it even by Bolsheviks; but now even tne UkrainianNationalists in Austria themselves have come out in opposition tothe expedition.   On March 13 an Ukrainian member of the Reichsrat,who in the past had been an extreme pro-Austrian,  asked questionsalleging that outrages were being committed  by the Austriansoldiers in the Ukraine.   By renewing intrigues with the ol*s the Austrian government has lost the confidence of theUkrainians.
     9.   The relations c  Austria to the Itoainians and. Polesdeserve attention - they may easily acquire importance in the nearfuture.   By the treaty of February 9 both the Polish and Ukrainianparts of CliQlm were assigned to the Ukraine.   On Pebruary 16 astatement was made by the Austrian Premier that the treaty wouldbe amended in accordance with nationality.   On the 28th a hintwas throTn out by a semi-official Austrian press agency that eventhe Ukrainian parts of Cbolm may yet be ceded to Poland.   OnMarch 7 the Polish leaders in the Reichsrat were summoned by theEmperor and were given an opportunity to -submit their demands tohim.   Of their four political points three were Polish imperialistConservative demands directed against the Ukrainians: that theentire province of Oholm should be ceded to Poland^ that noseparate Ukrainian province should be established in East Galicia,but that the entire country should remain under -Polish dominion&apos;,and that the Austrian government should intervene in the Ukraineon behalf ox the big Polish landowners.   After the reception by theEmperor the Polish bourgeois parties abstained from voting againstthe Budget and thus saved, fromdefeat the government against Y/hichthey had raised such a desperate outory only a few weeks earlier.It was not hard for the Ukrainians to $rasp the meaning oi thechange.     10.   Should the German armies get entirely tied down to theWestern front, and should they sustain serious reverses,  theposition in Austria is likely to become extremely critical.Should then a catastrophe overcome the Austrian expedition into theUkraine revolution ,in Austria would be almost unavoidable.    Thepolitical situation in the Ukraine is complicated,  but as it is aprimary concern to the Russian Bolshevik government they can betrusted to deal with it to the best of their ability.   It wouldseem however essential that from our end we should  encourage theBolsheviks to persevere In the Ukraine and help them,  if  that is inany way in our po?.?er.
