 RELEASE OP MEN EMPLOYED BY THE ADMIRALTY.    0--ar Cabinet 371 - Minute 10).Memorandum by the Minister of National Service.I desire to sunnort the reouest of theontroller thatthe Cabinet should make a direct  order upon the  Admiralty to release  12,500 men from Admiralty  &quot;A?! firms and  1,000  from Royal Dockyards,  in order to strength- en the hands of the Admiralty  in making the  necessary arrangements  with the employers and Trade  Unions for the  replacement  of these  men by  diluted labour.     On the questions  of detail raised  in the Controller&apos;s memorandum,  II have to offer the following  observations:-    (1) The question  of  levying a  uniform percentage on engineering firms        has been fully discussed with the Ministry  of Munitions; and 1        do not think  that It is practicable.   Such  a levy takes no  account        of the relative  urgency of the  contracts upon which  different        firms are engaged, or  of the differences in the numbers of  fit        men, liable for  military service under the  Sche ule  of  Protected        Occupations,  in  such firms.    (2) Under existing arrangements,  firms are entitled to claim pivotal        men: and I am- trying to arrange with the Admiralty and  the        Ministry of &quot;munitions  that such claims shall be decided quickly        on the spot in each  locality.    (3) If the Admiralty will  submit the names of junior  managers,  to-        gether with the  Units  in which  they  are serving,  I will do  mybest to arrange with the Adjutant General for t2icir re-call.   (4) I have explained to the Admiralty  that  it  is not possible to       guarantee the provision of  substitutes  in.the  sense  of  supplying       fully trained skilled workers to take the  place of skilled       workers who are released.   Like the Ministry of Munitions, the       Admiralty must fill these gaps by  up-grading and dilution; and I       understand that they are willing to do  this.   I shall,  of course,       do my best to secure that the necessary labour  is provided and I       have invited the Ministry of Munitions  to  co-operate with the       Admiralty to this end, so that vacancies in Admiralty firms may       be filled as far as possible by discharges of men and women from       Ministry of Munitions firms, and -where  necessary by  transfers       from such firms.  I have asked the Admiralty to encourage their       local officials to co-operate with the  local dilution officers of       the Ministry of Munitions,  in order that by joint visits to the       Admiralty firms they may see the class  of  labour which  isrequired,    At the same time,I am bound to point  out that no real power exists ofjompulsorily transferring men and that I do not control the machinery forllacing men in employment; and. that I cannot therefore do more  than I amloing  at the present time, namely,  to issue general instructions as to thepiorlty of competing demands and as to the enrolment of har V&apos;ork ^lunteers.;.4.ie.A.ft  rt x: T, rvr. c;
