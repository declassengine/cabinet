Copy of letter from the Prims Minister to Sir Horace          Plunkettt date\ 25th.IfobrvaryT&quot;1^18*                 (Reference War Cabinet 351 Minute 12)Bear Sir Horace Plunkett,          I have had  the privilege  of discussing,  during  thelast three weeks, the situation In  the Irish Convention withthe delegates whom the Convention appointed to confer with  theGovernment.   You will allow me to  thank  the Convention for send-Ing over a delegation so representative of all groups of  opinionWithin the Convention.   The Government have thereby been enabledto learn the views of different parties and to appreciate betterthan would otherwise have been possible the position that hasnow boon reached within the Convention.    I&apos;regret that  theurgency of questions vital to the immediate conduct of the  warhas protracted tho meotings with various  groups longer than itwas hoped would be necessary, but I am  confident the Conventionwill recognise the exceptional circumstances of the time  and willunderstand that there has been no avoidable delay.               -  -*          The conclusions to whioh  the  Government  have come asa result of their interviews ^ith the representatives of  theConvention may be stated as follows.          The Government are determined that so fac as is intheir power the labours of the Convention shall not be in vain.On receiving the Report of the Convention the Government  willgive it immediate attention and will proceed with  the leastpossible delay to submit legislative proposals to  Parliament,They wish, however, to emphasize the urgent importance of gettinga settlement in and through the Convention.   The  Convention hasbeen brotight together to endeavour to find a settlement by  consent.If the Convention fails to secure this, the settlement of thequestion will be much more difficult, but it will  be a task in-cumbent on the Government.   It is  therefore of the highestimportance both for the present situation and for  future  goodrelations In and with Ireland that the settlement  should  come froman Irish Assembly and from mutual agreement among  all parties.   Tosecure this there must be concessions on all sides.   It has beenso in every Convention, from that of the U.S.A. to that of South Africa.          There is, however, a further consideration which has  animportant bearing on the possibilities of the present situation.during the period of the war it is necessary to proceed as far  aspossible by agreement.  Questions on which there is an acutedifference of opinion in Ireland or in Great Britain must  be heldovsr for determination after the war.   At the  same time it  is  clearto the Government, in view of previous attempts at settlement,  andof the deliberations of the Convention itself,  that the  only hopeof agreement lies in a solution which, on the  one  side,  providesfor the unity of Ireland under a single legislature with adequatesafeguards for the interests of Ulster and the  Southern  Unionists
&amp;n&amp;, on the other, preserves  the  well-being of the  Empire  &amp;adthe- fun&amp;aDental unity  of  thej  United Kingdom.           It io evident  that  there  in  on tho part of all partiesin the Convention  a willingness to  provide for and safeguard theinterests  of tha Empire  and of the  United Kingdom.    A settlementQm now be reached which  will rosorTo by common, consent to theImperial Parliament its  suseralnty, and its control of Army, Hary,Foreign Policy and other  Imperial services, while providing forIrish representation  at Westminster end for a proper contributionfrom Ireland to Imperial  expenditure.    All the so matters  are nowoap&amp;ble of being settled  within tho Convention on a basis  satis-factory both to the Imperial  Government and to Ireland.           7fcere remains,  howover, the  difficult   usstlcn ofCustoms     igxeise,    The Government are aware of the seriousobjections which can  be  raised against the transfer of theseservices to an Irish legislature.   It would be practicallyImpossible to make such  a disturbance of the fiscal and financialrelations  of Great Britain and Ireland in the midst of &amp; great war.It might also bo incompatible with  that federal reorganisationof the United Kingdom  in  favour of  vrhioh there is a growing bodyof opinion.,   On tha  other hand,  the Government recognise  the strongolain that can be  made that an Irish legislature should have somscontrol over imdlr&amp;st taxation  as the only form of taxation  whichtouches the great  majority of the people, and whioh In the pasthas represented the greater part  of Irish revenue.           The Government  feel that  this is a matter which  cannotbe finally settled at  tho present time.   They therefore suggestfor the consideration  of  the  Convention that, during the periodof themr  sasd for  a period of two years thereafter, the controlof Customs and Excise  should  be reserved to the United KingdomParliament %  that, as  soon as possible after the Irish Parliamenthas been established,  a  Joint Exchequer Board should be set upto secure  the determination of the  true revenue of Ireland - aprovision  which is essential  to a system of responsible IrishGovernment and to  the  making  of a national balance  sheet;  and that,at the ens of the  mxt a  Hoyal Commission should be establishedto re-examine impartially and thoroughly the financial relationsof Great Britain and Ireland,  to  report on the  contribution ofIreland to Imperial expenditure and to submit proposals as to thebest means of adjusting  the economic and fiscal relations  of thetwo countries.           The Government  consider that during tho period of thewar the control of all taxation other  than,Customs  and Excisecould be handed over to the Irish Parliament;  that,  for the periodof the war and two years  thereafter an agreed proportion of theannual Imperial expenditure shouli?  be  fixed as  the  Irish contri-bution; and that all Irish revenue  from Customs  and Excise  asdetermined by the   oint Exchequer Board,  after  deduction of theagreed Irish contribution  to  Imperial  expenditure,  shouia be paidinto the Irish Exchequer.   For administrative  reasons duringthe period of the war it is necessary  that  the  Police  shouldremain under Imperial control  and it seems  to the Government tobe desirable that  for the  same  period  the Postal  Service shouldbe a reserved servioe.           Turning to the other  essential  element of a  settlement  -the securing of an agreement to establish a single legislaturefor an united Ireland * the Government believe that the Conventionbaa given much thought to the method of overcoming objectionson the part of Unionists, $crth and South, to this proposal.
    They understand that one scheme provides for additional  repres-    entation &quot;by means of nomination or election.  They understand    further  that it has also &quot;been suggested that a safeguard for    Ulster interests might &quot;be secured &quot;by the provision of an Ul3ter    Committee within the Irish parliament,  with power to modify, and    if necessary to exclude,  the application to Ulster of certain    measures either of legislation or administration which are not    consonant with the interests of Ulster,  This appears to be a    workable expedient,  whereby special consideration of Ulster con-    ditions can be secured ana the objections to a single Legislature    for Ireland overcome.          The Government would also point to the fact that it has    been suggested that the Irish parliament should meet in  alternate    sessions in Dublin and Belfast, and that the principal offices    of an Irish Department of manufacturing industry and commerce    should be located in Belfast.  They believe that the willingness    to discuss these suggestions is clear evidence of the desire to    consider any expedient which may help to remove the causes of    Irish disunion.  The fact that, in order to meet the claims of    different parts of the community,  the South African Convention    decided that the Legislature was to be established in Cape    Town,  the Administrative Departments to be situated in Pretoria    and the Supreme Court was to sit in Bicemfontein,  is a proof -    that proposals such as these may markedly contribute to  eventual    agreement.          Finally,  the Government have noted the very important    Report which has been prepared on the subject of Land Purchase    and on which a  unanimous conclusion has been reached by the    Committee of the Convention set up to consider this subject.    If this Report commends itself to the Convention,  the Govern-    ment would be prepared to introduce in parliament as part of    the plan of settlement (and simultaneously with the Bill    amending the Government of Ireland Act 1914) a measure for the    purpose of enabling Parliament to give effect to the recommen-    dations of the Convention on the subject of Land Purchase.   The    Government have also had submitted to them by the Labour represen-    tatives in the Convention the need of provision for dealing with    the urgent question of housing in Ireland,  and on receiving    recommendations from the Convention on the subject they  would    be prepared to consider the inclusion in the scheme of settle-    men t of a substantial provision for immediately dealing  with    this vital problem.          There thus seems to be within the reach of the Convention    the possibility of obtaining a settlement which will lay the    foundations of a new era in the government both of Ireland and    of Great Britain.  It is a settlement which will give to Irish-    men the control of their own affairs,  while preserving the  funda-    mental unity of the United Kingdom,  and enabling Irishmen to    work for the good of the Empire as well as for the good  of    Ireland.  With all the earnestness in their power the Government    appeal to the members of the Convention to agree upcn a  scheme    which can be aarried out at once and which will go a long way    towards realising the hopes of Irishmen all over the world,    without prejudice to the future considerations of questions  on    which at present agreement cannot be attained in Irelana and    which are also intimately connected with constitutional  problems    affecting every part of the United Kingdom,  the consideration of    which must be postponed till the end of the present war.  This    is an opportunity for a settlement by consent that may never recur,    and which,  if it is allowed to pass,  must inevitably entail conse-    quences for which no man can wish to make himself  responsible.The Rt. Hon.    Sir Horace Plunkett, K.C.V.O.,       Chairman, Irish Convention,             Dublin.
