The Director or his Executive Officer has conferred with the     Ministry of Pood, Ministry of Munitions, Local Government Board     and Ministry of National Service as to matters connected with     pig feeding that come within the province of those Departments.                         and Division.Small Holding Colonies.

As the Board only obtained possession on the     25th March, the arrears of work, in view of the shortage of     labour, will take some time to make up.   It is hoped to provide     accommodation for soldiers if they can be obtained,  and to obtain     the services of women as  soon as accommodation can be found for     them in tho farmhouse which is likely to be vacant at the end of     this month.Kelham 3state.          The terms of reference to the Estate Committee ofManagement have been widened to include the estate managementgenerally as well as the farming operations.   In view of this,careful attention is being given to the terms upon which thetenants left in occupation will retain their farms.   while thecustom of the country is being adhered to, the plan is to putspecifically in writing in the form of an up-to-date tenancyagreement tha rights and duties of both landlord and tenant,  theobject being to ensure better cultivation and greater co-operationwith the landlord in the general scheme of farming the estate asa wholeThe tenancy agreements operate^ for one year only,  asit is not yet intended that any modification shall be made to theoriginal proposal, that by the 6th April 1919 the whole of theestate shall be in hand and organised as one large farm.   Whilethese matters are engaging the attention of tho Estate Committee,rapid progress is being made with the farming operations;   the
recent spell of fine weather has been  of  considerable assistanceand full advantage has  boon taken  of  it.   Th.? work is being doneunder great difficulties through the unsatisfactory nature  ofthe horses acquired from the War Office for ploughing purposes.The ploughing is being completed with  the help of a gang ofselected German prisoners obtained  fea? the Committee by the PoodProduction Department, with English soldier ploughmen as foremen.                   Plax Production  Branch.          The total quantity of seed recjired for sowing theacreage taken, which amounts to some 13,000 acres, has now beenreceived in this country.   Sowing  has commscned in Somerset.Arrangements have been made for the provision of 2,000 women by theLand Service Corps to assist in harvesting.   Somo 12 camps are alsobeing established for holiday workers  from the City offices, banks,post offices, etc   An appeal has  been mads by the Ministry ofNational Service for 10,000 workers in order to maintain thestrength of these camps at about 3,000 during the harvesting period.-The response to this appeal has been fairly satisfactory.   InLincolnshire the Boy Scouts havo been  similarly organised and aforc^ of some 500 has been obtained.   In Stotland a considerablenumber of University women hav3 offered their services during thevacation.   Tho equipment of the factories is engaging the closeattention of the Office of Works, and  some portion of the necessarymachinery has already been ordered.

Administrative Section.    Officers of the Division havebeen engaged in consultation with Officers of the i-Jinistry ofReconstruction in considering questions affecting the developmentand improvement of the industry afte^ the War.   Questionsaffecting the application of the Education Bill 1918 to boys employedin the Sea Fishing Service, and schemes for technical education offishermen are under consideration.   advance arrangements areb:ing made for dealing with Dutch Fishing Vessels at Fleetwaod incase the proposals for the transfer of a number of Dutch boats tothat Port becGm--1 operative.          A considerable correspondence has arisen in connectionwith the powers recently conferred upon the Board by the FoodController affecting the relaxation of  restrictions On fishing forsalmon and freshwater fish.   A further Order proposed to be madeby the Board under those powers to give effect to certainrecommendations made by the Freshwater Fish Committee is nowawaiting formal concurrence by the Food Controller on the questionof preventing profiteering in the sale of salmon kelts by requiringthe fish to bo sold locally at prices fixed with the consent ofLocal Food Committees.   A highly satisfactory report has beenreceived with regard to the experimental work carried on by theBoard during the year 1917 at west Kersea,  in connection with theeconomic destruction of the Slipper Limpet:  it  is proposed toextend operations by establishing a similar undertaking on theKentish shore of the Thames Bstuary.       ^0L0I.-M^^Qi5ir^llt&apos;l^&apos;   Two more installations have beencompleted and the &quot;vessels&quot; &quot;nave run sv. set^sful trials, and otherinstallations, notably a twin-screw vessel,  are  nearing completion.The Committee have so much work in progress at present that each ofthe mechanics has upwards of four installations  in hand at the portat which he is working.   Considerable difficulty is being experienced
in most ports by the lack of shipwright labour, owing to thefact that young shipwrights and apprentices are being called upfor service in the Jirmy.   This shortage of labour is very seriously-hampering the Committee at several ports, and will probably&apos;meanthat a vessel which they have designed for a Brixham skipper, inwhich a Still engine was to be installed, will not be built.   Thisis the raore disappointing since the Committee had hoped that thisvessel would mark the transition from the sailing craft to themotor-driven vessel and would pave the way for a considerablenumber of other boats to be built, if not at once, at any rateafter the cessation of hostilities.  It is however gratifying tonooe that thy success of motor power has been so far establishedin Brixham that another skipper who is having a vessel built hasapplied for an engine for her.       Freshwater Fish Committee.   Further progress has been madein the arrangement for taxing over the Elver Fishing Plant atEpney on the Severn, which belonged to Germans and from whichthey have drawn 80/2 of their supply of Elvers.   It is proposed tosupply elvers for stocking purposes in suitable waters throughoutthe Country, and the Board by advertisement and oirculars haveinvited applications from persons interested.   Very many repliesare now being dealt with.   Arrangements are also being made fordesign and installation of Bel traps at suitable Weirs and thequestion of the possibility of advancing money on loan for theconstruction of such traps is under consideration.          The work of the Department in connection with Agriculturaleducation, veterinary control and livestock improvement continuesas usual.                            /7Secretary.4th April,  1918.
