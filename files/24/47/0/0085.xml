LETTER   OF   TRANSMISSION                              FROM THECHAIRMAN   OF   THE   IRISH  CONVENTION                                  TO               THE  PRIME   MINISTER.The Right Honorable D. LLOYD GEORGE, M.P.,             Prime Minister,                        10 Downing Street,                                London,SIR,    I have the honour to transmit herewith the Report of the Proceedings of theIrish Convention.    For the immediate  object of the Government the Report tells all that needsto be told: it shows that in the Convention, whilst it was not found possible toovercome the objections of  the Ulster Unionists, a majority of Nationalists,  allthe Southern Unionists, and five out of the seven Labour representatives were agreedthat the scheme of Irish self-government set out in Paragraph 42 of the Reportshould  be immediately  passed into law.  A minority of Nationalists  propose  ascheme which differs in only one important particular from that of the majority.The Convention has, therefore, laid a foundation of Irish agreement unprecedentedill history.    I recognise that action in Parliament upon the result of our deliberations mustlargely  depend  upon public opinion.  Without a knowledge of the circumstanceswhich, at the termination of our proceedings, compelled us to adopt an unusual methodof presenting the results of  our deliberations, the  public might be misled as towhat  has actually been  achieved.  It is, therefore, necessary to  explain ourprocedure.    We had every reason to believe that the Government contemplated immediatelegislation upon the results of our labours.  The work of an Irish settlement, sus-pended at the outbreak of the war, is now felt to admit of no further postponement.                                                               A2
In the Dominions and in the United States, as well as in other allied countries, theunsettled Irish Question is a disturbing factor, both in regard to war effort and peaceaims.  Nevertheless, urgent as our task was, we could not complete it until every possi-bility of agreement had been explored.  The moment this point was reached and youwill not be surprised that it took us eight months to reach it we decided to issueour Report with the least possible delay.  To do this we had to avoid further con-troversy and protracted debate.  I  was, therefore,  on March 22nd,  instructed todraft a Report.which should be a mere narrative of the Convention^ proceedings,with a statement, for the information of the Government, of the conclusions adopted,whether unanimously or by majorities.     It was hoped &quot;that this Report might be unanimously signed, and it was under-stood that any groups or individuals would be free to append to it such statementsas they deemed necessary to  give expression to their views.    The  Draft  Reportwas circulated on March 30th, and discussed and amended on April 4th and 5tb.The accuracy of the narrative was not  challenged,  though there was considerabledifference of opinion as to the relative  prominence which should be given to someparts of the proceedings.  As time pressed it was decided not to have any discussionupon a Majority Report, nor upon any Minority Reports or other statements which might be submitted.   The Draft Report was  adopted  by  a  majority, and the Chairman and Secretary were ordered to sign it, and forward it to the Government. A limit of twenty-four hours  was, by  agreement,  put  upon the reception of any other reports or statements,  and in the afternoon of April 5th the  Convention. adjourned sine  die.      The public  is thus provided with no Majority. Report, in the sense of a reasoned statement in favour of the conclusions upon which  the majority are  agreed, but is left to gather from the narrative of proceedings what the contents of such a report would have been.    On the other hand, both the Ulster Unionists and a minority of the Nationalists have presented Minority Reports covering  the whole  field  of the  Convention^  enquiry.    The result of this  procedure  is to  minimise the agreement  reached,  and to emphasise the  disagreement.  In these circumstances, I conceive it to be my duty  as Chairman to submit such explanatory observations as are required  to enable the reader of the Report and the accompanying documents to gain a clear idea of the real effect and significance of the Convention^ achievement.      I may assume a-knowledge of  the broad facts of the Irish Question.  It will be  agreed that, of recent  years, the greatest obstacle  to its settlement has been the  Ulster difficulty.  There seemed to be two possible issues to our deliberations. If a scheme of Irish self-government could be framed to which the Ulster Unionists would give their adherence, then the Convention might produce a unanimous Report. Failing such a consummation, we might secure agreement, either complete  or  sub- stantial, between the Nationalist, the Southern Unionist and the Labour representa- tives.  Many entertained the hope that the effect of such a  striking  and wholly new development would be to induce Ulster to reconsider its position.      Perhaps unanimity was  too  much to expect.   Be this as it may, neither time  nor effort was spared in striving for that goal, and there were moments when its  attainment seemed possible.  There was,  however, a  portion of Ulster where a  majority claimed that, if  Ireland had  the  right to separate herself from the rest  of the United Kingdom, they  had the same right to separation from the rest of Ireland.  But the time had gone by when any other section of the Irish people would accept
 the partition of their country even as a temporary expedient.   Hence, the Ulster Unionist members in the Convention remained there only in the hope that some form of Home Rule would be  proposed which might modify  the determination of those they  represented to have neither  part  nor lot in  an  Irish  Parliament.  The Nationalists strove to win them by concessions ;  but they found themselves unable to accept any of the schemes discussed and the Only scheme of Irish government^ they presented to the Convention was confined to the exclusion of  then entire Province.    Long before the hope of complete unanimity had passed, the majority of the Convention were considering the possibilities of agreement between the  Nationalists and the Southern Unionists.    Lord Midleton was the first to make a concrete proposal to this end.   The Report shows that in November he outlined to the Grand Committee, and in December brought before the Convention, what looked like a workable compromise.   It accepted self-government for Ireland.   In return for special  minority representation in the Irish  Parhament, already conceded by the Nationalists, it offered to that Parhament complete power over internal legislation and administration  and,  in matters of  finance,  over direct taxation  and Excise. But, although they agreed that the Customs revenue should be paid into the Irish Exchequer, the  Southern Unionists insisted upon the permanent reservation to the Imperial Parliament of the power to fix the rates of Customs duties.   By far the greater part  of our time  and attention was occupied by this one question, whether the imposition of Customs duties should or should not be under the control of the Irish Parliament.    The difficulties of the Irish Convention may be summed up in two words Ulster and Customs.    The Ulster difficulty the whole  world knows ;  but how the Customs question came to be one of vital principle, upon the decision of which depended the amount of agreement that could be reached in the Convention, needs to be told.  The tendency of recent political thought among constitutional Nationalists has been towards a form of government resembling as closely as possible that of the Dominions,  and, since the geographical position  of Ireland imposes obvious restrictions in respect of naval and military affairs, the claim for  Dominion Home Rule was concentrated upon a demand for unrestricted fiscal powers.  Without separate Customs and Excise Ireland would,  according to this  view, fail to attain a national status like  that enjoyed by the Dominions.    Upon  this  issue  the Nationalists   made  a  strong  case,  and   were  able to prove that a considerable number  of  leading commercial men  had come to&quot;favour  fiscal autonomy  as part of an Irish  settlement.  In the present  state of public opinion in Ireland, it was feared that without Customs no scheme the Con- vention recommended would receive a sufficient measure of popular support, to secure legislation.  To  obviate any serious disturbance of the trade of the United Kingdom, the Nationalists were prepared to agree  to a  free trade arrangement between the two countries.!   But  this  did not overcome the difficulties of the Southern Unionists, who on this point agreed with the Ulster Unionists.   They were apprehensive that a separate system of  Customs control, however guarded, might impair the authority of the United Kingdom over its external trade policy.  Neither could they consent   *See Appendix XIV.   f As  to the reservation to  the Imperial  Government of the  power to negotiate commercial treaties, see paragraph 19 of the Report signed by the Nationalist minority, p. 39 infra..
to any settlement which was, in their judgment, incompatible with Ireland&apos;s fullparticipation in a scheme of United Kingdom federation, should that come to pass.    It was clear that by means of mutual concessions agreement between the Nationa-lists and the Southern Unionists could be reached on all other points.   On this im-portant point, however, a section of the Nationalists, who have embodied their viewsin a separate Report, held that no compromise was possible.   On the other hand, amajority of the Nationalists and the whole body of Southern Unionists felt thatnothing effective could result from their work in the Convention unless some under-standing was reached upon Customs which would render an agreement on a completescheme attainable.   Neither side was willing to surrender the principle ;  but bothsides were willing, in order that a Parliament should be at once established, to post-pone a legislative decision upon the ultimate control  of Customs and Excise. *   Atthe same time each party has put  on record, in separate  notes subjoined  to theReport, its claim respecting the final settlement of this question.  A decision havingbeen reached upon the cardinal issue, the majority of the Convention carried a seriesof resolutions which together form a complete scheme of self-government.    This scheme provides for the establishment of a  Parliament for the whole ofIreland with an Executive responsible to it,  and with full powers over all internallegislation,  administration and direct taxation.   Pending a decision of  the fiscalquestion, it is provided that, the imposition of duties of Customs and Excise shallremain with the Imperial Parliament, but that the whole of the proceeds of thesetaxes shall  be paid into the Irish Exchequer.   A joint Exchequer Board is to be setup to determine the Irish true revenue, and Ireland is to be represented upon theBoard of Customs and Excise of the United Kingdom.    The principle of representation in the Imperial Parliament was insisted uponfrom the first  by the Southern Unionists,  and  the Nationalists conceded it.  Itwas felt, however, that there were strong reasons for providing that the Irish repre-sentatives  at Westminster should be elected by the  Irish Parliament rather thandirectly by the constituencies,  and this was the arrangement adopted.    It was  accepted  in  principle  that  there  should be  an  Irish  contributionto the cost  of Imperial services but, owing to lack of data, it was not found possiblein the Convention to fix any definite sum.     It was agreed that the Irish Parliament should consist of two Houses a Senateof 64 members and  a  House of Commons of 200.   The principle underlying thecomposition of the Senate is the representation of interests. This is effected by givingrepresentation to commerce, industry, and labour, the County Councils, the Churches,learned institutions and the Peerage.  In constituting the House of Commons theNationalists offered to guarantee forty per cent, of its membership to the Unionists.It was agreed that, in the South, adequate  representation for Unionists could onlybe secured by nomination;  but, as the Ulster  representatives had informed theConvention that  those for whom they spoke could not accept the  principle ofnomination, provision was made in the scheme for an  extra representation of Ulsterby direct election.     The majority of the Labour representatives associated  themselves with theNationalists and Southern  Unionists  in building up  the   constitution,  with theprovisions  of which they found themselves in  general agreement.   They frankly               * See Prime Minister^ letter of 25th February, 1918, p. 20 infra.
objected, however, to the principle of nomination and to what they regarded as theinadequate representation of Labour in the Upper  House.   Throughout our pro-ceedings  they helped in every way towards the attainment of  agreement. Nordid they  press their own special claims in such  a manner as to make more dinicultthe work, already difficult enough, of agreeing upon  a constitution.    I trust I have  said enough to enable the reader  of this Report and the accom-panying documents to form an accurate judgment upon the nature and difficultiesof the task before  the  Convention and upon  its  actual achievement.    While,technically, it was our function to draft a constitution for our country, it would bemore correct to say that we had to find a way out of the most complex and anomalouspohtical  situation to be found in history I might almost say in fiction.   We areliving under a system of government which survives only because the Act abolishingit cannot, consistently with Ministerial pledges, be put into operation without furtherlegislation  no  less difficult and  controversial  than  that  which it has to  amend.While the responsibility for a solution  to  our problem rests primarily with theGovernment, the Convention found itself in full accord with your insistence thatthe most hopeful path to a settlement was to be found in  Irish agreement.   Inseeking this in  attempting to find a compromise which Ireland might accept andParhament pass into law it has been recognised that the full programme of no partycould be adopted.  The Convention was also  bound to  give due weight to youropinion that to press for a settlement at Westminster, during the war, of the questionwhich, as I have shown, had been a formidable obstacle to agreement would beto  imperil the prospect of the early establishment  of self-government in Ireland.     Notwithstanding the difficulties  with which we were  surrounded,  a largermeasure  of agreement has been reached upon the principle and details of Irish self-government than has ever yet been attained.  Is it too much to hope that the schemeembodying this  agreement will forthwith be brought to fruition by those to whose call the Irish Convention has now responded ?                           I have the honour to  be,                                                      SIB,                                             Your obedient servant,                                                    HORACE PLUNKETT.

REPORT   OF   THE    PROCEEDINGS  .   ..&apos;  &apos;  . &apos;   &apos;            . OF THE     -  &apos;  i      &quot;  ...       IRISH    CONVENTION.    1. The nature of the task which the Irish Convention was called into existenceto perform is described in the letter which the Prime Minister addressed to the lateMr.  John Redmond on the  16th May, 1917.   This letter is reprinted as the FirstAppendix to this Report.   In the letter of invitation which the Prime Ministeraddressed to the members of the Convention the scope of its work is described in thewords quoted below :     &quot; The terms of reference to the Convention are set forth in the following passagefrom a letter&apos;on the subject which was lately addressed to the leaders of the principalIrish parties in  the House of Commons :          &apos; Would it be. too much to hope  that Irishmen of all creeds and parties    might meet  together in a Convention for the purpose of drafting a constitution    for their country which should secure a just balance of all the opposing interests,    and finally compose the unhappy discords which have so long distracted Ireland    and impeded - its harmonious  development ? &apos;  I  further referred to this matter in the House of Commons in these words :         &apos; The Government therefore propose to summon immediately on behalf of    the  Crown a Convention of representative Irishmen in  Ireland,  to submit to    the  British  Government a constitution for the future government of  Ireland    within the Empire.&apos;&quot;    2. Invitations were extended to the  Chairmen of the thirty-three  CountyCouncils, the  Lord Mayors  or Mayors  of  the six County  Boroughs;  whilst theChairmen of the Urban  Councils  throughout Ireland  were  requested to  appointeight representatives,  two from each province.  The  Irish  Parliamentary Party,the  Ulster Parliamentary Party and the  Irish Unionist Alliance were each invitedto nominate five  representatives.   An invitation was extended to the  RomanCatholic Hierarchy- to  appoint  four - representatives; the Archbishop of Armaghand the  Archbishop of Dublin were appointed to represent the Church  of Ireland,and the  Moderator of the General Assembly to represent the Presbyterian Churchin Ireland.   Invitations were also extended to the Chairmen of -the Chambers ofCommerce of  Dublin,  Belfast and Cork, and to  Labour organisations, and therepresentative peers of  Ireland were mvited to select  two  of their number.  Allthese invitations were accepted except  by  one Chairman  of a  County Council.Invitations intended  to secure representation of the  Sinn  Fern party and theAll  for  Ireland party were declined, as were the invitations extended to the Trades  -Councils of Dublin and Cork.   Subsequently, hi  addition to one  member  selectedto  represent the  Trades and Labour Council  of Belfast,  six  persons  wereappointed to represent  various labour organisations,  and fifteen other  personswere nominated  by the  Government, making  the  total  membership  of theConvention ninety-five. *  During  the course of its proceedings the Conventionlost three of its  members  by death (Sir  Henry  Blake, Mr.  Redmond, and SirAlexander McDowell), and two by resignation (Mr. Lysaght and Mr.,Russell) whichreduced the number to ninety.     3. The first meeting of the Convention was held on July 25th, 1917,in the Regent CONVENTION,House,  Trinity College, which, together with a large number of rooms for offices, m to 4th Sessionshad, by the courtesy of the Provost  and Fellows of Trinity College, been placed JuAj25t   uv-&apos;tl- ,&apos;t the disposal of the Convention.   The Chair was  taken by the Chief Secretary,&quot;vho delivered an address,&quot; and the Convention then proceeded to  elect  Sir HoracePlunkett as Chairman,  and Sir  Francis Hopwood, now Lord Southborough, as* A  list of the members of the Convention Secretariat and Committees will be found in Appendix II.

              Secretary.  The second, third, and fourth meetings were occupied with the adoption              of  Standing  Orders, the consideration of  the general  course  of  procedure to be              followed, and the appointment of  a Grand Committee of twenty members for the              purpose of consulting with the Chairman as to the general procedure to be adopted,              by the Convention, and of exercising such powers as might from time to time be 3              delegated to it by the Convention.  This Committee held twenty-two meetings.                  4.  The procedure adopted by the Convention was  carefully thought out, and              is fully explained in the letter of the Chairman  to   the  members,  dated 17th              August, 1917, which is printed as the Third Appendix  to this Report.   Its object              was to ensure the fullest and frankest expression of opinion,  to enable members              to  know each other&apos;s point  of view  and,  at the same time, to avoid  raising con-              tentious issues in such a way as to divide the Convention upon party lines.   This              end was successfully  attained by means of what came to be called the Presentation              Stage!   It was decided that the various schemes for the future government of              Ireland which had been submitted  to the Convention, whether  by  members or              by persons who were not members,  should be  first  considered  by  the  Grand              Committee.   All  the schemes that this body thought suitable for discussion were              then to be. presented in turn to the Convention.   While they were being debated              no decisions  were to be taken,  and  it was generally  understood  that  criticism,              whether destructive or constructive, Avas to be directed towards their improvement so              that the several proposals should  be placed before  the Convention in the  best form.              When  this stage had been concluded, the future procedure was to be decided by              the Convention.   The  speeches  made were not officially reported, and the com-              munications issued to the press were worded so as to avoid any undue or premature              disclosure of the deliberations of the Convention.   It was thought that under these              conditions a  more unrestrained exchange of views would be possible than  under              circumstances of greater publicity.  CONVENTION.       5.  A  short  adjournment  was  found necessary  in  order   to  enable the^utl^-^h^Sep  Grand  Committee  to carry  out  the  preliminary  work,  and the actual business              of  considering  proposals for the  future  government of Ireland which the Grand              Committee thought  suitable for  discussion  did not begin until the fifth meeting              on  August   21st.    From  this  date  until  the  twenty-second  meeting,  on              September  27th,  the  Convention,  which  met  for  three  days in  each  week,              was  occupied  with   the   general  consideration  of   the schemes  which had              been presented.  Most of these schemes followed in their main outline  the form of              government enjoyed by the Dominions,  but they exhibited, in a varying degree,              a  certain measure of  departure, which  was , thought by  their authors  to  be              necessitated by the  special  circumstances  of Ireland, from the  normal type of              Dominion self-government.   In   some  schemes  the  departure  from  this type              was  more  marked,  and these plans more  closely  approximated  to the  Home              Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893 and the Government of Ireland Act of  1914.   Two              of the  schemes provided for  the continued representation of  Ireland in  the Imperial              Parliament,  and  were framed  with  the  special  view  of enabling the  new Irish              constitution to fit into a future  complete federalisation of the United  Kingdom.              Several of the schemes provided that, in addition to a central Irish Parliament, there            .  should be established provincial legislatures ; whilst some which favoured the creation            .  of a single Irish legislature suggested that the members representing each province              in the Irish Parhament should be constituted into a Provincial Grand Committee              with special  powers  of veto, and possibly of initiative, in  respect of  legislation              or administration so far as  that province was concerned. *    Most of  the schemes              claimed for an Irish Parhament full control over all Irish  taxation, including Customs              and Excise.                  6. Apart from  the  main question  whether  an  Irish Parliament, with an              executive responsible thereto,  should be established, debate on the schemes sub-)              mitted chiefly  centred on  the extent of the  power  that  the Irish Parhament              should  possess  over taxation;   the question  whether  Ireland   should make a              statutory or  voluntary  contribution  to  Imperial  expenditure,  including x the              national debt; the, constitution of  the two  Houses of  the Irish  Parhament,              with special  reference to the adequate representation of minorities ; what power, it              any, Ireland should have in connection with defence;  what should be the respec              tive obligations of the British and Irish Exchequers with regard to land purchase;              and the question whether there should be provincial legislatures.                  * A Ivb morandum on the subject of Provisional Grand Committees was circulated to the Con-1              vention by Lord MacDonnell.
    10.  A short interval was found necessary in order to enable preparations for GRANDthe work of the Grand Committee to be carried  out.    That  Committee,  which COMMITTEE,had been reconstructed for its  new  work, met on  October  11th,  and decided Uth Oct., 1917.that the most effective means of  carrying out its task would be, in the first instance,to  delegate  the duty of finding  a  basis  of  agreement  to  a Sub-Committee ofnine members.  Subsequently, on  the  suggestion  of  the Chairman, three otherSub-Committees were appointed to deal with Electoral Systems and Areas, Defenceand Police, and Land Purchase.Uth Oct.-21st Nov    11.  The Sub-Committee of Nine held fourteen meetings, and made two Reports SUB-COMMITTEEto the Grand Committee, an Interim Report dated  November  15th and a Final OF^NINE,Report dated November 21st.*  The procedure which they followed was to go throughseriatim-  the Heads of the Scheme referred to above.    They succeeded, as they in-formed the Grand Committee, in  arriving at  certain  provisional  conclusions  onmost of  the  Heads, but these provisional  understandings were all  contingent  onfull  agreement on the general scheme being reached.    12. The following statement  shows  (column  1)  the  Heads of  the  Schemepresented hj the Bishop of Raphoe, and  (column  2)  the  provisional  conclusionsarrived at bv the Sub-Committee of Nine :-           HEADS OF SCHEME.

Of the first twenty-two meetings, sixteen were held in Dublin, three in theCity Hall, Belfast,  and three in the  Crawford Technical Institute, Cork.   It wasgenerally felt that the hospitable  invitations received from  these two  cities oughtto  be accepted  in view  of  the opportunity thus afforded  to members  offamiliarising themselves with the  widely different  social and economic conditionswhich characterise  different parts of the country.    Full advantage was taken ofthis opportunity, and it was the opinion of all members that the results of thesetwo visits in promoting a fuller knowledge and understanding of Ireland more thancompensated for any delays  which they entailed.    8. Before the sittings in  Cork had concluded on  September 27th, the followingresolutions were carried unanimously :              1. &quot;That on the conclusion of the debate at  the present sittings of        the Convention, the various schemes  which have been  submitted to and        discussed in the Convention  be referred to the Grand Committee in order        if possible to prepare a scheme for submission to the Convention which would        meet the views and difficulties expressed by the different speakers  during        the course  of the debate.&quot;             2. &quot;That the Convention stand  adjourned after this  week&apos;s  sitting        until the Grand Committee  is in a position to report.&quot;    9. In order that the Grand Committee might fulfil the  task thus delegated toit, the Chairman decided to ask one of its members to draft the Heads of a Schemewhich might form a basis of  discussion in the Grand Committee  and ultimately beplaced before the Convention, if possible,  in the form of a complete agreed scheme.Mr. Redmond, as representing the  largest  section in the Convention, was first askedto render  this service, but he preferred that it should be undertaken by someoneother  than a political leader.   The Chairman then approached the  Bishop  ofRaphoe, who consented to present the Heads of a  Scheme.
Heads of Scheme.Provisional Conclusions.  3. Exclusions from  Power of Irish Parlia-MENT. &quot;The Irish Parhament to have no  powerto make laws oh the following matters :-     (1)  Crown and succession (Act,  sect. 2 (1) ).     (2)  Making of peace and war (including con-  duct as neutrals).  (Act, .sect. 2  (2) ).

(b) The  Irish Parhament may after five          years raise and maintain a territorial          force subject to the authority  of the          King,   provided that  the  Imperial          Conference,  in  which Ireland  would          be  represented, assents.  The restrictions are  accepted generally,ject  to  the  following qualifications:  sub-Sub-head (3),  (a) and (b).   These were  de-    ferred  for  further consideration,  pending    the  Report  of  the  Sub-Committee   on    Defence.  (4) Treaties and foreign relations (includingextradition).     Ireland to  have  power  similar  to  the         dominions in  respect of  commercial         treaties.  (5) Dignities and titles of honour.Sub-head  (4) is reserved for  consideration in    connection with  the general question of    finance, in so far as it gives to Ireland the    powers of a Dominion in regard to Com-    mercial Treaties.   (6) Any necessary control of naval harbours, and  certain  powers  as regards  lighthouses,. buoys,  beacons,  cables, wireless terminals, to be settled with reference to the requirements of the  Military  and  Naval  forces  of  His Majesty in various contingencies.Sub-head  (6).   It is considered that &quot; control    of harbours for naval  and military pur-    poses&quot; should be substituted for &quot; control    of naval harbours.&quot;  4. RESTRICTIONS  ON POWER  OF IRISH PARLIA-MENT ON MATTERS WITHIN ITS COMPETENCE.     (1)  Prohibition  of  laws  interfering  with  religious equality (Act, sect. 3).     N.B.

(5) Rights of  existing  Irish Officers to be  safeguarded  (Act,  sects.  32-7).  Is accepted. With regard to sub-head 1, the pro-vision for equal treatment of religious denomina-tions  in future  must proceed from a  basis ofequal treatment  at present.  That is,  the  dis-abilities, etc., remaining under the Act of 1829should be annulled.  5. CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENTS.   The  powerof the Irish Parliament to amend its constitutionis a  subject which  should be  considered by aSub-Committee.  It is agreed that the question of the power ofthe Irish  Parhament to amend its  Constitutionshould be considered by a Sub-Committee.  6. EXECUTIVE  AUTHORITY.   The   executivepower in Ireland to continue vested in the King,but exereisable through the Lord Lieutenant onthe advice of an Irish Executive Committee inthe manner set out in Act (sect.  4).

The --Irish Parliament to be  summoned,  proroguedand dissolved as sot out in Act (sect.  6).Is accepted.
HEADS OF SCHEME.PROVISIONAL CONCLUSIONS.  8.  ASSENT TO BLLLS.  Royal assent to be givenor withheld as set out in Act (sect. 7). CONSTITUTION OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.(1) Lord Chancellor         ...       ...   1(2) Four Archbishops or Bishops of the      Roman  Catholic Church      ...   4(-3) Two Archbishops or Bishops of the      Church  of  Ireland    ...       ...   2(4) The  Moderator  of  the   General      Assembly    ...       ...            1(5) The Lord  Mayors  of Dublin,  Bel-      fast and Cork         ...       ...   3(6) Thirty-nine Temporal Lords      ...  3950  Is accepted, subject to  a preference  beingexpressed for the reservation of  Bills instead oftheir postponement.  The  title of Senate  was preferred  to that ofHouse  of Lords.  The  following modification of the proposals inthe scheme was provisionally approved:    CONSTITUTION OF SENATE.    Lord Chancellor    ...      ...      ...   1    Archbishops or Bishops  of the Roman        Catholic  Church        ...      ...   4    Archbishops or Bishops  of the Church        of Ireland    Moderator of the General Assembly ...

In thatevent it was intimated that an addition to thenumber of Roman Catholic Bishops would  beexpected.  It was  also suggested that the  Privy  Coun-cillors selected should  be of two or three  years&apos;standing.  The size of  the  Senate must be considered inrelation to the size of  the Lower House, and  itwas  subsequently  considered that if the LowerHouse  came down to 100  or 120 members  itmight be  convenient to reduce the  Senate to 40members.    This would involve a reconsiderationof the details  of the above  scheme.  It was agreed  that the members of the UpperHouse should be nominated for, say, seven years.  10.  CONSTITUTION  OF  HOUSE  OF  COMMONS.The Irish House  of Commons to consist of 168members 162 elected by constituencies  similarto those set out in the memorandum of the IrishTrades Union Congress, and two each by  DublinUniversity, the   National  University  and  theQueen&apos;s University.  The principle   of proportional representationwith  a single  transferable  vote  to  be observedwherever a constituency returns three or moremembers, and no constituency  to  return morethan seven.  During the first ten years of the Irish Houseof Commons  twelve additional  members  to  benominated to  represent the  industries, commerceand  trade  of  the  North-east of  Ireland, andtwelve to represent the Southern  Unionists.  The House of  Commons to continue for fiveyears unless previously dissolved.  It was  agreed that the Unionists should beoffered, by effective means, a proportion of fortyper cent,  in the Lower House;  and that  in theUpper House of,  say,  forty, thirty should bemen with  a  substantial stake in the country.The exact method of arriving at this result wasleft for further consideration,  but it was agreedthat it could  only  be obtained by  including asubstantial number of nominated members.  Itwas suggested that, in order to reduce to a mini-mum this undemocratic  element in  the House,the size  of the  House  should be smaller thanthat proposed  in the scheme.  It was stipulated that the nominated elementin the  Lower House should continue for not lessthan ten years.  Lord Midleton suggested  that,  on the  dis-appearance of this nominated element, an addi-tion should be made to the numbers of the  UpperHouse.   This might be done and was reservedfor further consideration.   N.B. The interim Re-port of the Suh-Com-mittee of Nine stated that after these provisionalconclusions had been arrived at (1th Nov.), it wasconsidered desirable that the  Ulster representa-tives  should  communicate with their AdvisoryCommittee with a view to discovering how far thearrangement proposed with regard to the composi-tion of the two Houses  of Parliament was likelyto prove acceptable.   Having taken  this course,
HEADS OF SCHEME.          PROVISIONAL CONCLUSIONS.they intimated, on November 13th, that the Advi-sory Committee were unable to approve of the sug-gestion  that the  Ulster  representation  in  theLoiver House should be strengthened by the addi-tion of a number of nominated members.   Theyconsidered that the proposal to  include noini-nated members  to represent  Southern Unionistscould be defended and might be accepted, but thesame considerations did not apply in  the case ofUlster.   The Ulster representatives undertook tosubmit proposals for safeguardijig the  interests ofUlster by means other than the extra representa-tion which had been contemplated *  11. MONEY BILLS.  Money bills to originate onlyin the House of Commons and not to be amendedor rejected  bv the House of Lords  (Act,  sect.10).  12. DISAGREEMENTS  BETWEEN HOUSES.    Dis-agreements  between the two Houses to be solvedby joint sittings as set out in Act (sect. 11).  13. REPRESENTATION AT WESTMINSTER. Repre-sentation in the Parhament of the United  King-dom to cease until there is a federal parliament.  It was agreed that the  Senate should havepower tc force a joint sitting of both Houses overmonev bills.  14. FINANCE.  The provision (No. 2 above) asto the powers  of  the  Irish Parliament  gives itcomplete control over finance, including customsand  excise.  An Irish exchequer and consolidated  fund tobe established and an Irish Controller and Audi-tor-General  td be appointed as  set  out  in  Act(sect. 14 (1) and sect. (21).  If necessary, it should be  declared that  alltaxes at present  leviable in Ireland should con-tinue to be levied and collected until the IrishParliament otherwise decides.  The  necessary  adjustments  of  revenue  asbetween Great Britain  and  Ireland  during  thetransition period should be made.  15. As  soon as may  be after the passing ofthe  Act a joint Commission, one-half the mem-bers of which shah be chosen to represent Irelandand  the other half to represent Great  Britainshall 1 p. appointed by His Majesty to negotiateand  agree upon  a  trade, postal,  and  customsunion between Great Britain and Ireland, whichshall aim at securing and promoting  the  mutualinterests of both  countries in all  such  matterswhere their interests are common, or connectedor parallel or capable of being  united for mutualadvantage;  and  in other matters  where theirinterests- are separate or competitive to  providefor the fair pursuit of these interests with  theleast prejudice to both  countries.Agreed. REPRESENTATION AT WESTMINSTER.  The Unionistrepresentatives intimated that this was a sine quanon.  On the Nationalist side it was stated that,while they  did not  favour  the continuance ofrepresentation in the Imperial Parhament, pend-ing Federation  of the United Kingdom, they didnot look upon its cessation as a sine  qua non.  It was  agreed that any Irish representativesab Westminster must have full power to deliber-ate and vote on all questions.  The question whether Irish representatives atWestminster should be directly elected or dele-gated by the Irish Parliament was reserved forfurther consideration.  It was suggested that thepresence of a  nominated element  in the  IrishHouse of  Commons would  probably give theUnionists for a time larger  representation in  adelegation  appointed by  that  House than bymembers  directly  elected.  Reserved  for further consideration.  The Nationalist Representatives were preparedto accept a guarantee of  Free  Trade betweenGreat Britain  and Ireland,  at any  rate  for  aterm of years.   The Unionists were of  opinionthat such a guarantee was inconsistent with, theIrish control of Customs and Excise.* These proposals were not submitted under the circumstances explained in A ppendix IV.  (See p. 59).
              HEADS or SCHEME.  The convention. as agreed shall be  submittedto the parliaments of both countries, and, if notdisapproved  of within  the  next 30 days,  shallbecome  of force and  effect for *a  period of  10years  subject to modification or  renewal  by.mutual agreement.   Every modification  or  re-moyal shall in like manner be submitted to bothparliaments, and be subject to then approval.  If the Commission fails to arrive  at an agree-ment, or  if the  convention agreed  upon  isdisapproved  of by  either parliament, the  mostfavoured nation terms in  force relating  to thematter in  question,  whether  with  a  foreigncountry  or  with  a dominion government,  shallbecome operative as between both countries, andshall be brought into  force by a  proclamationof His Majesty.  16. IMPERIAL CONTRIBUTION.  The  Irish Parlia-ment  shall fix  the  contribution winch Irelandshall make  to the cost of  Imperial  defence andadministration,  considering  the  financial andeconomic ability of her population, and the pro-tection which Ireland  receives from  the armyand navy.   The over-taxation  of Ireland in thepast and her share in the  national debt may beset off against each other.  Ireland to have no share in  the miscellaneousrevenue of the Imperial Government (Suez CanalShares, etc.)  As from the passing of the Act or the transferof  any services, the  Irish  Government  shouldassume  liability  for  all loans  that have  beenmade  in Ireland,  and for  deposits in  savingsbanks, etc.  The question of land purchase is dealt within the next  section.  17. LAND  PURCHASE.  The Irish  Governmentto  assume  all responsibility for land purchaseloans, excess stock, and bonus, and to be entitledto  receive  all payments to  be  made  by tenantpurchasers.  Future loans to be made  on the credit of the Irish  Government,  or if   satisfactory arrange-ments can be made, on the credit of  the ImperialGovernment.  An  equitable scheme of  land  purchase thatwould be compulsory on owner and tenant alike,where voluntary bargains  are  not  forthcoming after a certain period, could be sanctioned. Thetotal provision  for  excess  stock  and bonus atpresent  amounts to  800,000 a year.  The subsidy from the tax payer for pendingagreements will, owing to  changes  in.the price of money,  be at a much greater rate in pending cases than it was in the cases already completed.Another million, or  more,  may be needed  for the unsold areas.  The whole obligation is largely an Imperial one,  and Ireland should get creditfor discharging it in  considering the question of an Imperial contribution.   18.  JUDICIAL POWER.  The following provisions of the Government of Ireland Act to be adopted:     (a)  Safeguarding  position  of  existing  Irish           Judges (Act, sect. 32).     (b) Leaving  appointment  of  future  Judges           to the Irish Government  and  their           removal  to the  Crown  on  address           from both Houses of Parliament (Act,           sect. 27).   *PROVISIONAL CONCLUSIONS.  Ee served  for further consideration in connec-tion with the question of Finance.  The Nation-alist members  of  the Sub-Committee  recordedtheir recognition of the principle of such a con-tribution,  though  reserving  their  views  as  tomethod and amount.  Reserved for consultation with the Sub Com-mittee investigating this question.  Agreed, conditionally upon the Unionists hav-ing effective  representation in the Lish Parlia-ment.  It was agreed that the Lord Chancellorshould not be a political  officer, but  that  hissalary as Speaker of the Senate should be placedon the Estimates.
HEADS OF SCHEME.PROVISIONAL CONCLUSIONS.    (C) Transferring appeals from the House of          Lords  to  the  Judicial Committee,          strengthened  by Irish  Judges (Act,          sect. 28).    (d) Extending right of appeal to this Court.          (Act, sect. 28 (4) and sect. 30 (1-2) ).    (e) Provision as to reference  of questions of          validity to Judicial  Committee (Act,          sect. 29).  19. LORD LIEUTENANT.   The Lord Lieutenantto hold office for 6 years, and to be subject tono religious  disqualification  (Act, sect. 31).  20. CIVIL SERVICE.  A Civil Service Commis-sion  to be appointed to regulate competitiveexaminations for admission to the pubhc service,promotions, and the exercise of higher patronage..  Provision should be made for ensuring that inthe future the salaries of Irish pubhc  officials,appointed after the passing of the Act,  shall beupon a scale appropriate to Ireland.  21. DEFERRING  TAKING  OVER  CERTAIN  IRISHSERVICES.  Arrangements to be made to permitthe Irish Government, if they so desire, to defertaking  over the services relating to Land Pur-chase,  Old  Age Pensions,  National Insurance,Labour Exchanges, Post Office, Trustee SavingsBanks, and Friendly Societies.  It was agreed that the salary of the LordLieutenant should be sufficient to throw the postopen to men not of great wealth.  It was agreed that  the Lords Justices shouldbe subject to no religious disqualifications.  It was agreed that a strong Civil Service Corn-mission should be established, and the followingcomposition was  suggested:   Lord  Chancellor, Chairman;  two permanentmembers appointed  by  the  Lord Lieutenant,and  holding office during good  behaviour.  The  practice of the  Enghsh  Civil  ServiceCommission to be followed as  far as possible.  Competitive  examinations to  regulate  admis-sion to  the Service as far as possible.   -  The   Unionist   members having  expressedanxiety as to the exercise of patronage in Ulster,it  was suggested that two additional membersmight  be added to the Commission to protecttheir interests. . It was agreed that the present  exercise ofpatronage by the Lord Chancellor would requireto be reviewed, and that there should, in future,be no unpaid Magistrates.  A clause should be inserted requiring the CivilService Commissioners to prepare a scheme forfuture  appointments to the Pubhc Service, suclischeme to be  laid before  both Houses beforeany such appointments are made.  It might bean instruction to  the Commissioners, in framingsuch a sche^ne, to devise  a scale appropriate tothe financial and other circumstances of L-eland.  Reserved for further consideration.SUB-COMMITTEEOF NINE.     13.  It will be seen that on the majority of the above Heads there was no markeddisagreement  in the Sub-Committee of  Nine, though it was found necessary toreserve certain Heads or parts of  Heads (viz., Head 3, sub-heads (3) and (4), Heads9, 10, 13-17 and 21) for further  consideration.    On two Heads, 14 and 15 dealingwith Finance, agreement  could  not be  reached, and it  was  the divergent  viewsheld on this matter which prevented the Sub-Committee from  reaching  that hiagreement on  the general scheme  which was required to  remove the contingecharacter  of the conclusions arrived at  on the other  points.     14. The position of the Siib-Committee of  Nine as  regards the fiscal issue isset out in Appendix IV. and may be summarised as follows :      The Scheme presented contemplated that, pending federation of the United Kingdom, there should be no Irish representation in the Imperial Parliament, and providefor the exercise by the Irish Parhament of complete control over finance, mcluch\Customs  and Excise, and suggested the appointment of a Commission to negotiata Trade,  Postal,  and Customs Union between  Great Britain  and Ireland.   TlUnionist  representatives  demurred  to these  proposals, those from Ulster insistinthat full  control over finance should be left &apos;to the Imperial Parhament, while thSouthern  Unionists  were prepared to  agree that Excise might be the subject ospecial consideration.
* See Appendix IV., p. 70.      15. Lord Southborough, in an endeavour to find a compromise, submitted to  the Sub-Committee of Nine certain projjosals for giving to the Irish Parliament  full control of taxation, subject to an arrangement for Free Trade between Great  Britain and Ireland, and special provisions to meet the case of dumping (see Appendix  IV., Schedule III.).   Lord Southborough also submitted further proposals, which  were a development of a suggestion previously made by Lord Midleton, that Customs  should be reserved to  the Imperial Parliament and that Excise should be specially  considered.   Under these proposals (see Appendix IV,  Schedule  VIII.)  the  imposition of Customs Duties would  remain with the Imperial Parliament, the.  collection would be carried out under the authority of  a Joint Board, and an Irish  contribution to Imperial Services would be made a first charge agahist the Customs  revenue.   The remaining sources of revenue would be under the control of the  Irish Parliament.      16. It was not found possible  to reach an agreement upon these lines, and it  was feared that the Sub-Committee of Nine might have no alternative but to report  to the Grand Committee to that effect.   The Chairman of the Convention was,  however,  anxious that the Sub-Committee should make a closer examination of the  arguments on the one side and the other.   He embodied this view in a letter dated  &quot;November 6th, enclosing certain questions addressed to the Ulster and Nationalist  representatives respectively, with a list of possible compromises (see Appendix IV.,  Schedule  IV).                                 .      17. Two sets of replies were submitted  by the Nationalist representatives, one  signed by four members (see Appendix IV.,  Schedule V.), the other by one member  (see Appendix IV., Schedule  VI.).  The signatories of the  former  set demanded  fiscal  autonomy (hicluding  control over Customs and Excise as well  as  direct  taxation) similar to that enjoyed by self-governing colonies, but they were prepared  to agree to an arrangement for securing for a term of years free trade between Great  Britain and  Ireland, except in excisable articles, with a proviso against dumping.  The reasons which made them unwilling to accept any smaller measure of Irish  control over taxation will  be found in their answers.   These  also  contained  alternative proposals for meeting the fears of Unionists in respect of fiscal autonomy.      18. - The Nationalists replies were communicated to the Ulster representatives, and  considered by them.   They felt that in the circumstances the divergence of views  disclosed  was so great that no useful purpose would be served by a formal reply to  theTquestions submitted to  them, and on November  14th they addressed to the  Chairman  of the  Convention  a letter containing a general statement  of  their  attitude on the financial problem, and declaring their opinion that for Ireland and  for Great Britain a  common system of Finance, with one  Exchequer, was a funda-  mental essential (see Appendix IV., Schedule VII.).      19. The Chairman did  not consider it  necessary to address any questions to  the representative of the Southern Unionists, who occupied an intermediate position,  Lord  Midleton  having already, on their behalf, put forward  a  suggestion that  Customs  should be reserved to the Imperial Parliament, and that Excise should be  specially  considered.      20. In their Final Report of November  21st, the Sub-Committee of Nine stated  that, in consequence of the continued divergence of their views on the financial  question, their endeavour to find a basis for agreement had not proved success-  ful.*      21. In consequence of this report, the Grand Committee, on November 22nd, took GRAND  up the task  of attempting to frame a scheme for the future government of Ireland. COMMITTEE,  Eight  meetings were  held  between November  22nd  and  December  13th ;  the   ov&apos;&apos; ec  proceedings  being  interrupted during  the first week in December  owing to the  Parliamentary duties of several members.      22. During these meetings the Grand Committee considered the  provisional  conclusions which had been reached by the Sub-Committee of Nine on the HeadsI of the Scheme submitted to them.  The Report of the  Sub-Committee on Electoral  Systems  and Areas (see Appendix V.) was considered in connection with Heads  9 and 10 relating  to the constitution  of the  Senate and the House of Commons,  and the recommendations of the Sub-Committee were, for the most part, accepted  and utilised.  In accordance with the suggestion made by the Sub-Committee of
                                  lbNine, a special Sub-Committee was appointed to consider the question of constitutional amendments.   The Report made by this Sub-Committee was adopted hithe Grand Committee, and incorporated in Head 5 of then Provisional Conclusi ^(Appendix  VI.).   As in  the Sub-Committee  of  Nine, provisional   agreementscontingent  on the acceptance of a general scheme, were arrived at on most of thHeads,  though  certain  Heads  had  to be reserved for future consideration.Agreement upon the fiscal issue, however, could not be reached, and the conflict oopinion on this issue again prevented the attainment of a full agreement on a generascheme.    23. During the proceedings of the Grand Committee, the views of Nationalistsfavour of fiscal autonomy, and of Ulster Unionists in favour of fiscal unity, as seforth in their answers to the Chairman&apos;s inquiries (see Appendix IV.), were furthexpounded, and Lord Midleton, on the  28th November,- on behalf of  the SoutherUnionists, laid before the  Grand Committee a memorandum defining their attituJon this question (see Appendix VII.).  The Grand Committee, however, were unabto reach an  agreement upon the  fiscal issue, and they came to the conclusion ththe matter must be referred to the Convention.CONVENTION,23rd to 36thSessions.18th Dec, 1917,-24th Jan., 1918.    24. Owing to important parliamentary business requiring the attendance at Weminster of some members, the Convention could not meet until the 18th Decembwhen a statement was made by the Chairman, showing what progress had been maand  what difficulties  encountered (see Appendix VIII.).   The Report of  the SuCommittee of Nine, (Appendix IV.) already referred to, was circulated amonthe Convention together with a statement of the provisional conclusions arrivedby the Grand Committee upon the Heads of the Scheme and the findings of tSub-Committee of Nine thereon (Appendix VI.).  The Reports of the Sub-Committon Electoral Systems and Areas, (Appendix V.), and on Land Purchase (AppenIX.) Avere also circulated; but the principal work  of the Convention duringfourteen meetings held  between the 18th December, 1917 and the 24th Janua1918 AAras the consideration of the fiscal difficulty.     25. In pursuance of his attempt to find a compromise between the demandcomplete fiscal autonomy for Ireland and the demand for the complete fiscal miof the United Kingdom, Lord Midleton on  the 2nd  January, 1918, introducedfollowing Resolution:          That, in the event of the establishment of an  Irish Parliament, there s     be reserA^ed to the Parliament  of the United Kingdom full authority for     Imperial services, including the leAying of Customs  duties, but subject to     above limitations the Irish Parliament shall control all purely Irish servi     including Judicature and Police with internal taxation and administration.     26.  Lord Midleton&apos;s proposals were amplified from time to time, in a seriememoranda (see Appendix VII.).    He  proposed that during the war the procof  Customs and Excess Profits  duties  should go to the Imperial Exchequer,Irish Exchequer receiving the proceeds of other taxes, and any additional amthat might be necessary to coArer the  ascertained cost of Irish seiwices.   Subto the aboA^e, all forms of taxation, including Excise, but excluding Customs duwere to  be  controlled by the  Irish  Parliament.   After  the Avar Customs diAAroulcl continue to be imposed under the authority of the Parhament of the UnKingdom.   The Imperial Exchequer Avould, hoAveArer, retain only so much ofreceipts from such duties  as would  represent a fair  contribution  to  the  costImperial services,  the amount of such contribution to be determined after enqby a Commission representing both  Great Britain and Ireland.     27. Lord Midleton proposed, further, that a permanent Joint Revenue B* should be set up and hi vested AArith the folloAving functions :             (1) To  determine  the true Customs revenue of Ireland.            (2) To secure  co-operation betAveen the revenue authorities of the       countries with regard to traffic  in excisable articles.The provisional agreements arrived at are recorded in Appendix VI.
          (3) To determine tlie respective claims of the British and Irish  Goverh-      ments to levy direct taxation on the property or income of persons  resident      partly in Ireland, partly in Great Britain.          (4) To advise with regard to alleged cases  of dumping to the injury of      Irish industries.          (5) To recommend reductions in Customs duties  on articles  of  general      consumption in Ireland, in the event of the proportion of Customs and Excise      duties to the total tax revenue in Ireland exceeding the similar proportion,      in the case of Great Britain, by fifteen per cent., in two successive  years.    28.  Various amendments to   Lord Midleton&apos;s resolution  were proposed anddiscussed at the meetings of the Convention on  January 2nd, 3rd, 4th, loth, 16th,17th, 22nd, 23rd and 24th. *  The most important amendments were  designed towithdraw- Customs from the control of the Imperial Parliament, and leave the raisingof all taxes to an  Irish Parliament.  In the course of the debate, Lord Midleton&apos;sproposal received  support from  a number  of  Nationalist  members, who,  whileretaining the  view that Ireland ought   to  control  all sources of taxation, werewilling to accept  his compromise in order to secure agreement;  and the  majorityof the Labour representatives expressed their readiness to follow the same course.On the  other hand, a  number of  Nationalists were unable  to accept any arrange-ment which deprived the Irish Parliament of the control of Customs ; nor  did LordMidleton&apos;s proposals meet  the objections  of  the Ulster Unionist representatives.    29. It therefore became apparent that on the financial issue there were threeclearly  defined  bodies of   opinion  in the   Convention:  the Ulster Unionists,advocating the maintenance of the fiscal unity of the United Kingdom ;  a section ofNationalists insisting on complete fiscal autonomy for Ireland;  and the  SouthernUnionists, with the adherence of other Nationalists and the  majority of the Labourmembers, advancing a compromise which left to Ireland the proceeds of all sourcesof revenue, and the imposition of  all taxes other than Customs.  In these circum-stances,  the Chairman considered it to be his  duty  to communicate to  the Con-vention on January 24th the following letter which  the Prime Minister  had senthim to  use at  his discretion :                                     10 DOWNING STREET,                                           WHITEHALL, S.W.  1.                                                       21st January,  1918.     DEAR SIR HORACE PLTJNKETT.         In our conversation on  Saturday you told me  that the situation  in the     Convention has now reached a very  critical stage.  The issues are  so grave     that I feel the Convention  should not  come to  a definite break without the     Government  having the opportunity of full consultation with  the leaders of     the different sections.  If,  and  when, therefore, a point  is reached at which     the Convention finds  that it can  make  no further progress towards  an  agreed     settlement, I would ask that representatives should be sent to confer with the     Cabinet.    The Government  are agreed and determined that a solution must     be found.   But they are firmly convinced that the best hope of a settlement     lies within the Convention and they are  prepared to do anything in their power     to assist the Convention finally to reach  a basis of agreement, which would     enable a new Irish Constitution to come into operation with the consent of all     parties.                                         Yours sincerely,                                                     D.  LLOYD   GEORGE.    *The sessions of the Convention held on the 8th, 9th, and 10th January, 1918, were devoted tothe consideration of the Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase.   (See paragraph 40 infra).
CONVENTION..        32. The Convention reassembled for its thirty-seventh session on the  26thSe sions49tl1    February, when the Chairman made a report on the interviews that had taken place2Q,hFeb.-Mar.22nd between the Delegation and the  Cabhiet, and read the following letter from the              Prime Minister:                                                       10, DOWNING STREET,                                                                      LONDON,  S.W.,                                                                   25th February, 1918.              DEAR SIR HORACE PLTJNKETT,                  I had the privilege of discussing, during the last three weeks, the situation in              the Irish  Convention  with the delegates whom the Convention appomted to confer              with the  Government.   You will allow me to thank the Convention for sending              over a delegation so representative of all groups of opinion within the Convention.              The Government have thereby been enabled to learn the views of different parties,              and to appreciate better than would otherwise have been possible the  position that              has now been reached within the  Convention.   I regret that the urgency of ques-              tions vital to the immediate conduct of the war has protracted the meethigs with              various groups longer than it was hoped would be necessary, but I am confident the              Convention will recognise the exceptional circumstances of the time and will under-           .   stand there has been no  avoidable delav.                  The conclusions to which the  Government have come as a result of their inter-              views with the representatives of the Convention may be stated as follows :                   The Government are determined that, so far as is hi their power, the labours              of the Convention shall not be in vain.   On receiving the report of the Convention,              the Government will  give it immediate attention, and will proceed with the least              possible delay to submit legislative proposals to Parliament.   They  wish, however,              to emphasise the urgent importance of getting a settlement in  and  through the              Convention.   The  Convention has been  brought  together to endeavour to find a              settlement by consent.   If the Convention fails to secure this, the settlement of              the  question will be much more difficult, but it will be a task incumbent on the              Government.   It is, therefore, of the highest importance botli for the present              situation  and for future  good relations hi and with  Ireland that the  settlement              should come from an  Irish assembly, and from mutual agreement among all parties.              To secure this there must be concessions on all sides.   It has been so hi every Con-              vention,  from that of the U.S.A.  to that of South Africa.                  There is, however, a further consideration which has an important bearing on              the possibilities  of the present situation.   During the  period of the war it is neces-              sary to proceed as  far as possible by agreement.   Questions on which there is an              acute difference of opmion in  Ireland  or  in Great Britain must  be held over for              determination after the war.   At the same time it is  clear to the Government, hi              view of previous attempts at settlement, and of the deliberations of the Convention              itself, that the only hope of agreement lies in a solution which, on the one side,              provides for the unity of Ireland under  a single Legislature with adequate  safe-              guards for the interests of Ulster and  the Southern Unionists,  and, on  the other.              preserves the well-being of the Empire and the fundamental unity of the  United              Kingdom.                  30. The debate on  Lord Midleton&apos;s motion and  on an amendment thereto              moved by the Bishop of Raphoe, claiming control of Customs for the Irish Parlia-              ment, having  been suspended, the  Convention considered the Prime Ministers              letter and, after an exhaustive discussion, passed the folio whig resolution :                       &quot; That the Convention thanks the Prime Minister for his letter, and, though                  it does not feel the possibilities of agreement are exhausted, it considers that                  they may be increased by the acceptance of his offer, and it  is,  therefore,                  nominating delegates to confer with the Cabinet.&quot;DELEGATION TO      31. In accordance with this decision, a Delegation representative of ah sectionsLONDON.        proceeded to London, and had interviews severally  and  collectively  with  the              Prime  Minister  and  other members of the Cabinet.
       It is evident that there is on the part of all parties in the Convention a willing-   ness to provide for and safeguard the interests of the Empire and of the United/fl Kingdom.   A settlement can now be reached which will reserve by common consent   to  the  Imperial  Parliament its suzerainty, and its control  of  Army, Navy,  and   Foreign Policy  and  other  Imperial services, while providing  for Irish represen-   tation at Westminster,  and for a proper contribution  from Ireland to  Imperial   expenditure.   All these matters are now capable of being settled within  the Con-   vention on a basis  satisfactory both to the Imperial Government and to Ireland.       There remains, however, the difficult question  of Customs and Excise.   The   Government are aivare of the serious  objections which can be raised against the   transfer of these services to an Irish Legislature.    It would be practically impos-   sible to  make  such a disturbance of the fiscal and financial relations  of Great   Britain and Ireland in  the midst of a great war.   It might also be  incompatible.   with that federal re-organisation of the United Kingdom in favour of which there   is a growing body  of opinion.   On the other hand, the Government recognise the   strong claim that can.be made that an Irish Legislature should have  some control   over hidirect taxation as the only form of taxation which touches the great majority   of  the people, and which  in the past has represented  the  greater part  of  Irish   revenue.    -  The Government feel that this is a matter which cannot be finally settled at   the present time.  They therefore suggest  for the consideration of the Convention   that, during the period of  the  war and for a  period  of  two years thereafter, the   control of Customs and Excise should be reserved to the United Kingdom Paiiia-   ment;  that, as soon as possible after the Irish Parliament has been established, a   Joint Exchequer Board should be set up to secure the determination of the true   revenue of Ireland a provision which is essential to a system of responsible Irish   Government and to the making of a national balance  sheet, and that,  at the end of   the war, a Royal Commission should be established to re-examine impartially and   thoroughly the financial relations of  Great Britain and  Ireland, to report on the   contribution of Ireland to Imperial expenditure, and to submit proposals  as to the   best means of adjusting the economic and fiscal relations of  the two countries.       The Government consider that during the period of the war the control  of  all   taxation other than Customs and Excise  could be handed over to the Irish Parlia-   ment;  that, for the period of the war and two years thereafter an agreed proportion   of the annual Imperial  expenditure should be fixed  as the Irish contribution; and   that all Irish revenue  from Customs  and Excise as  determined  by the Joint Ex-   chequer Board, after deduction of the agreed Irish contribution to Imperial expen-   diture, should be  paid into the Irish Exchequer.   For administrative reasons,   during the period  of the war it is necessary that the Police should remain under   Imperial control and it seems to the Government to be desirable that for  the same   period  the Postal service should be a  reserved service.       Turning to  the  other  essential element of a  settlement the securing of an   agreement to establish  a single  Legislature for  an united Ireland the Government   believe that the  Convention has given much thought to the  method of overcoming   objection on the part of Unionists, North and South, to this proposal.   They under-   stand,that one scheme provides for additional representation by  means  of no mi-   nation or election.    They understand further that it  has also been suggested that   a safeguard of  Ulster interests might be  secured by the provision of an Ulster   Committee within the Irish Parliament, with power to,modify,  and if  necessary to   exclude, the application to Ulster of certain measures either of legislation or admini-   stration which are not consonant with the interests  of Ulster.  This appears to   be  a workable expedient, whereby  special  consideration of  Ulster conditions can   be  secured and the objections  to  a single Legislature  for Ireland overcome.       The Government would also point to the fact that it has been proposed that the   Irish Parliament should meet in alternate sessions in Dublin and Belfast, and that   the  principal offices of  an Irish Department of manufacturing  industry and  com-g-  merce  should be  located in Belfast.   They believe that the willingness to discussv-  these suggestions is clear evidence of the desire to consider any expedient which may   help to remove the causes of Irish disunion.  The fact that, in order  to meet the   claims of different parts of  the community, the South African Convention decided   that  the  Legislature  was to  be established in Cape Town, the Administrative
Departments to be situated in Pretoria,  and the Supreme Court was  to  sit inBloemfontein, is a proof that proposals such as these may markedly contribute toeventual agreement.    Finally, the Government have noted the very important Report which has beenprepared on the subject of Land  Purchase and on which an unanimous conclusionhas been reached by the Committee of the Convention set up to consider this subject.If this Report commends  itself to the  Convention, the Government would be pre-pared to introduce in  Parliament as part of the plan  of  settlement (and siinul-taneously with the  Bill amending the Government of Ireland Act, 1914) a measurefor the purpose of  enabling Parliament to give effect to the recommendations ofthe Convention on the subject of  Land Purchase.   The Government have also hadsubmitted to them by  the Labour representatives in the Convention the need ofprovision  for dealing  with the  urgent. question of  housing in Ireland,  and onreceiving recommendations  from  the  Convention on the  subject they  would beprepared to  consider the  inclusion in  the scheme of settlement of   a substantialprovision for immediately dealing with this vital problem.    There thus  seems to  be within the reach of  the Convention the possibility ofobtaining a settlement Avhich will  lay the foundation of a new era in the governmentboth of Ireland  and of  Great Britain.   It is a settlement which  will give to Irish-men the control of  then own affairs, while preserving the fundamental unity of theUnited Kingdom, and  enabling Irishmen to work for the good  of the Empire aswell as for  the  good of  Ireland.   With all the earnestness  in their power theGovernment appeal to the members of the Convention to agree upon a scheme whichcan be carried out at once and which will  go a long way towards realising the hopesof Irishmen  all  over the  world,  without  prejudice to the future consideration ofquestions on which at present agreement cannot  be attained in Ireland and whichare also intimately connected with constitutional problems affecting  every  part ofthe United Kingdom, the consideration of which  must be postponed till the end ofthe present war.   This is  an opportunity for a settlement by consent that may neverrecur, and which, if it is allowed to pass, must inevitably entail consequences forwhich no man can wish to make himself responsible.                                               Yours sincerely,                                                     D.  LLOYD  GEORGE.CONVENTION,        33. The consideration of the views expressed by the Cabinet to the Delegation&apos;Mth-28tk February  and  by the  Prime  Minister  in his letter  occupied  the  sessions  of February              26th, 27th and 28th.  It was felt that a new situation had been created,  and the              discussion was directed to seeing whether the suggestions made in the Prime Ministers              letter could be made the basis of an agreement in the Convention.  One suggestion              was  at  once  adopted,  a Committee  being appointed to  consider  under what              conditions assistance could best be given to Housing in Urban Areas in Ireland.March 5th-6th.      34. On March 5th the Convention decided not to resume the consideration of the              motion introduced  by  Lord Midleton on January 2nd, but to take up a resolution              which had been submitted by Lord MacDonnell and which, in effect, embodied, with              variation in detail, some of the suggestions contained in the Prime Ministers letter.              The first part of this resolution was in the following terms : The matters  specified              as unfitted for immediate legislation, namely, control of Customs and Excise by an              Irish Parliament, be postponed for further consideration until after the war, on the              condition that  such.control of Customs and Excise by the Irish Parliament shall              come into effect automatically three years after the cessation of hostilities unless              the Parliament of the United Kingdom  shah otherwise decide.   Another part ol              the resolution proposed that during  this  interim period the Board of Customs and              Excise should include a person, or persons, nominated by the Irish Treasury, and              also provided for the creation of a Joint Exchequer Board to  secure the deter-              mination of  the true revenue of Ireland.    These propositions raised in a definite              form the fiscal issue which  had been  debated at  length, in the  Convention,  first              during the Presentation Stage, then on Lord Midleton&apos;s motion of the 2nd  January              and the amendments thereto, and finally on the Prime Minister&apos;s letter.
     35. The consideration of Lord MacDonnelTs motion was  postponed owing 42nd-49th to Mr. Redmond&apos;s death  and the adjournment  until  after the funeral.   When Sessions. the  Convention re-assembled on March 12th the  first part of  Lord MacDonneirs Mardl mh&apos;2-nd resolution (see Appendix  X.)  appeared in another form.   It proposed that the imposition of Customs and  Excise should be under the control of the Imperial Parliament  during the war  and thereafter  until  the question  of  such  control had been considered and a  decision arrived at by the Imperial Parliament, the decision to be taken not later than seven years after the conclusion of peace.   The first part  of Lord MacDonnelTs  resolution was put to the vote  and carried by 38 votes to 34.  The text  of the resolution and full particulars  of the amendments proposed and divisions taken will be found in Appendix X.     36. The opinion of  the majority upon the main financial question having now been formally expressed, the Convention decided to resume the consideration of the statement of provisional conclusions reached in the Grand Committee (see Appendix Y.)r  These were considered on the 14th, 15th, 19th,  20th, 21st, and 22nd March. The Heads on  which there  was provisional  agreement  in  Grand  Committee were adopted &quot;with but little alteration, and discussion  mainly  centred on  those Heads reserved by  the Grand Committee for consideration by the  Convention. The text  of the Heads and  of the amendments proposed and particulars of the divisions taken will be found in Appendix XI.                                                   i     37. One amendment caUs for particular  notice.   On i^Iead 2, Mr. Barrie pro- posed to exclude from the power and authority of the Irish Parliament the province of Ulster,  referred to as &quot; The Excluded Area.&quot;  Mr. Barrie had on the 12th March circulated an outline of a  scheme of Irish Government based on the Amending Bill of  1914,  (see Appendix XIV.), and  had placed  on the Agenda Paper a motion to consider  it.  The motion, however,  was not pressed in view of his amendment which raised the same issue.    This amendment was discussed on March 14th and 15th and rejected by 52 votes to  19.  (See Appendix XI).  .     38. It will be remembered that the Grand Committee had appointed three Sub- pLECT0RArj Committees to deal with specific questions.  The Report of the Sub-Committee on SYSTEMS AND Electoral  Systems and Areas (see Appendix  V.) was not formally considered by the AREAS. Convention, but its recommendations  were  discussed in connection with the con- stitution of the Senate and  the  House of Commons and were  largely incorporated in the proposals adopted by the Convention under these Heads.     39. The Report of the Sub-Committee on  Defence  and Police (see  Appendix DEFENCE AND XV.) was considered by the  Convention and adopted on 14th  March by  54 votes POLICE. to 17.   The amendments proposed and the - divisions  thereon are  recorded  in Appendix XII.     40. The Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase, which was  accepted LAND PURCHASE in principle by the Grand Committee, had been discussed in the Convention on the 8th,  9th  and  10th  January, and certain  suggested amendments were  referred to the Sub-Committee for their  consideration.   The final Report of the Sub-Com- mittee (see Appendix IX.)  was considered by the Convention  on the 22nd March and  after discussion unanimously adopted.  It  should be noted that the Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase, which contains detailed recommendations for a complete settlement of the agrarian question, was based on  the assumption that the  duty  of  the  Sub-Committee  was  to  inquire  into the problems  pre- sented  by  Land Purchase, not under the existing form  of  government, but  as part of a large scheme for recasting the framework of government  hi Ireland, and they stated that their recommendations could  not be taken as agreed to  on any other hypothesis.   The  amendments  proposed to the Report on 22nd March and the divisions thereon are  recorded in Appendix XIII.   jf 41. The Report of the Committee appointed, in accordance with the suggestion 51st Session.icontained in the Prime Ministers letter of the 25th Februarv, 1918, to consider the    HOUSING. question of Housing in Urban Areas in Ireland (see Appendix XVI.), was considered by the Convention on the 5th April, and unanimously adopted.

The  answer  to  our  Reference,is to be found in the following statement.   This statement embodies the conclusionsarrived at by majorities, full particulars of which  will be found in Appendices Xto XIII.                         STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS.*    1.

SOUTHBOROUGH,                       HORACE PLUNKETT,           Secretary.                                       Chairman.5th April, 1918.
                    REPORT                           OFULSTER  UNIONIST   DELEGATES                           TO          IRISH   CONVENTION.    1. We, the Ulster Unionist Members of the Convention, find ourselves unable toconcur in the Chairman&apos;s Draft Report.   We protest against its implication thata measure of agreement regarding Irish Self-Government was attained, which infact was not the case as is evidenced by the record of the Divisions.   The provisionalconclusions on minor matters which were arrived at in Committee were strictlycontingent on agreement, on the vital issues.   These were fundamental and uponthem  no agreement was at any time visible.   On many of the important questionsthe Nationalists were sharply divided.   All discussions were &quot; without prejudice &quot;and subject to complete agreement being reached on the whole Scheme.  Absolutefreedom of action as regards decision in Convention on all points was reserved andthis was  clearly indicated throughout the proceedings.    2. In  confirmation of this statement  the  following  extract  from  LordMacDonnelTs Memorandum (sqe Appendix  XIX.) issued  to the Convention  on&apos;8th March, 1918, may be quoted :             &quot;It is true that this report does not bind the Grand Committee, still        less the Convention, even on the points on which no difference of opinion        is recorded, because all the provisional understandings which were arrived        at were  contingent on a full agreement on the  general  scheme being        reached;  and  it cannot be said this agreement has been reached.&quot;    3. In order that an accurate estimate may be formed of the origin and purposeof the Irish Convention, it is necessary to recall the political situation  as it existedin the early summer of 1917.    4. The Home Rule Act of 1914, to  which Ulster was inexorably opposed, hadbeen placed on the Statute Book, in disregard of the  truce entered into at the be-ginning of the war, at which time an Amending Bill excluding Ulster from the Acthad passed through its initial Parliamentary stages with general consent and waspostponed in consequence of the European situation.    5. Yielding to the demands of the Nationalists, the Prime Minister, in a letteraddressed to  Mr.  John Redmond, on 16th May, 1917,  offered :        (a) A &quot; bill for the immediate application of the Home Rule Act to Ireland,            but excluding therefrom the six Counties of North-East Ulster &quot; ;  or,            -alternatively,       (b) A Convention of Irishmen &quot; for the purpose of  draftmg a  Constitution            for their country .... which  should secure a just balance of all the            opposing interests.&quot;    6. Mr. Redmond refused the first proposal, but acquiesced in the suggestion of a Convention, in which Ulster Unionists were invited to join.  On 21st May, 1917, in announcing the Governments mtention to  summon the Convention, the Prime Minister said: &quot; No  one I want to make this quite clear by the mere fact of going to the Convention can be assumed to be pledged to the  acceptance or the rejection of any particular proposal or method for the Government of Ireland.&quot;
    7. Ulster Unionists felt some natural hesitancy in sending delegates to the Con-vention, but relying absolutely on this pledge, and on further pledges given by thePrime Minister and Mr. Asquith,  that Ulster would not be forced to come under aDublin Parliament, they ultimately consented.  In taking this course the  UlsterUnionists were animated by the desire to do what was best for the Empire, for GreatBritain, and for Ireland.   They  were satisfied with the Constitution under whichthey had lived and prospered, and they desired to continue under the Union whichthey still believe to be the form of Government best suited to the needs of Irelandand best calculated to maintain  the stability of the Empire.   They were ready,however, to consider any plan that might be put forward, provided it would increasethe happiness and comfort of the people  and at  the same time  maintain thesupremacy of  the  Imperial Parliament.    8. Ulster Unionists, who have thrown themselves whole-heartedly into the war,deplore the fact that in this great world crisis, when their entire energies ought tobe devoted to providing  men and  munitions, they should  be even temporarilydiverted  from  vital national issues on which the very existence  of the  Empiredepends in order to again take up  a subject the consideration of  which had beenrightly postponed  on the outbreak of hostilities.    9. In view of  Ulster&apos;s  well-known doubts and fears and of the undeniable factthat the declared  object of the Convention was to &quot; secure a just balance of allopposing interests &quot; it  was not  unnatural  to assume  that the Nationalists wereprepared to offer a modus  vivendi, and formulate proposals of local Parliamentarygovernment for Ireland which would at least:       (1) Provide for  the absolute supremacy of the  Imperial Parliament;      (2) Maintain the existing fiscal unity ;      (3) Guarantee protection for the undoubted rights of the Unionist minority ;      (4) Ensure  the safety of Irish industrial enterprises, the vast proportion of             which are situated in the North-Eastern Counties of Ulster,  and from             which the bulk of the Irish Revenue is derived.    10. We expected that the real work of the Convention would have been directedto a sincere and patriotic  endeavour to  find common ground somewhere betweenthe 1914 Act on the one hand, and the views of Ulster  on the other.   From thefirst week in which the Convention sat we urged this course, and repeatedly expressedour disappointment that almost every Nationalist speech outlined  a form of HomeRule  far in advance of any previous claim.    11. The Scheme, which was finally brought forward by the Bishop of Raphoe onbehalf of  the  Nationalists  included the following demands :                             t      First -A Sovereign  Independent Parliament for Ireland co-equal in power             and  authority with  the Imperial Parliament.      Second Complete Fiscal Autonomy for Ireland, including :              (a) Power of imposing tariffs and  control of Excise, involving, as it                   would, the risk of hostile tariffs against Great Britain and the                   disturbance of free intercourse between the two countries ;             (b) Right of making Commercial Treaties with foreign countries ;             (c) Full powers of direct taxation.      Third Right to raise and maintain a Military (territorial) Force in Ireland.      Fourth Repudiation of any liability for the National Debt on the plea of             over-taxation of Ireland in the past.   Subject to the consent of the             Irish Parliament, the principle of a small annual contribution towards             Imperial  expenditure  was admitted.
       Fifth Denial of the right of  the  Imperial Parhament to impose Military             Service in Ireland  unless with the consent of  the proposed  Irish             Parhament.   12.  When the Clause claiming Fiscal Autonomy for Ireland was reached, it soon be-came evident that no real approach towards agreement was possible.  At that stagethe Chairman endeavoured to get over the deadlock by putting a series of questionsto the Nationalists and to the Ulster Unionists,  and the replies sent in  speak forthemselves.  The real object of these proposals was clearly apparent in the officialreply to the Chairman&apos;s queries of 6th November, signed by the following NationalistLeaders : John  Redmond, the Lord Bishop of  Raphoe, Joseph Devlin, GeorgeRussell.     13. In this document the Nationalists again  emphatically insisted upon  theirdemand  for  Ireland&apos;s  fiscal independence,  and  crystalised their  argument inthe following terms : &quot; We regard Ireland as a Nation, an economic entity.  Self-government does not exist  where those  nominally  entrusted with   affairs ofGovernment have not control of  fiscal and economic policy.&apos;&apos;     14. It is, therefore, clear that Fiscal Autonomy hicluding the control of Customsand  Excise and National  taxation is valued by the Nationalists not only on theground of  supposed economic  advantage  but as  an essential symbol of Nationalindependence.    In  opposition to  this Ulster takes a firm stand on the basis of thepeople&apos;s  common  prosperity,   and maintains that the Fiscal unity of the UnitedKingdom  must be preserved intact, carrying with it as it does the sovereignty ofthe Imperial Parhament and  due representation therein.     15. The important question of how far Ireland should contribute to Imperialtaxation raised much controversy.  In the earlier stages of the discussions someprominent Nationalists stated quite frankly that  they recognised no responsibilityfor any portion of the pre-war National Debt, nor for the present war expenditure,whilst  we claimed that hi justice and hi honour Ireland must continue to pay herfull  share  of both.  The majority of  the  Nationalists declined to  admit  suchliability.     16. During the  financial year just ended Ireland&apos;s Imperial contribution will, it isestimated,  amount  to  about  thirteen millions sterling, and possibly  to  twentymillions next year.  An  important section  of the  Nationalists objected  to anyImperial contribution being paid, but the larger  number favoured a contributionranging from two and a half&apos;to four and a. half millions sterling per annum.   Itwas  invariably  a condition that the contribution should be purely voluntary andat the pleasure  of  the Irish Parliament.   We listened to these suggestions withkeen disappointment, knowing of no reason why Ireland,  which is abundantlyprosperous, should not hi  the hour of the Empire&apos;s need contribute  her  full shareof men and monej^.  We  have always contended that there  should be equality ofsacrifice hi every part of the United  Kingdom.     17. As already  pointed  out, a further  Clause in the Bishop of Raphoe&apos;s Schemewith which we found it impossible to agree  claimed that compulsory Military Servicecould not  be imposed upon Ireland by Great Britain unless with  the consent of theIrish Parliament, and this demand was supported by  a majority  vote  of theConvention.     18. Again, it was claimed that, in contradistinction to the provisions of all pre-vious Home Rule Bills, the Royal  Irish Constabulary, a semi-Military Force, shouldimmediately at the conclusion of the war come under the control of the Irish Parlia-ment,  The 1914 Act provided that this Force should remain under Imperial controlfor a period of  six years.  In the present state of Ireland such a proposal must beregarded as &quot; excessively dangerous.&quot;   This is the opinion expressed by the Inspec-tor-General of the Force, whose statement appears in the Appendices I.C. 27.
    19. Failing any evidence of an approach to a narrowing of our differences, and inview of the new demands made,and adhered to by the Nationalists, we were finallyforced  to declare that in any such scheme of Self-Government for Ireland Ulstercould not participate.   We cannot Overlook the strong  probability  that the con-trolling force in such a Parliament would to-day be the  Republican or  Sinn FeinParty,  which is openly and aggressively hostile to Great Britain and to the Empire.During recent months in many parts of Ireland, outside  of Ulster, there has beena great renewal of lawlessness, and crime bordering on anarchy, which unfortunatelyhas not been adequately dealt with by the Irish Executive.                                                            t    20. A most remarkable situation arose in the Convention when a vote was takenon the proposal to adjourn the proceedings until an assurance was received from theGovernment that they would promptly take effective steps to restore law and orderand repress outrage throughout Ireland.  Fifty Nationalist Members voted againstthat proposal,  and 33 Members, including the Ulster Unionists, voted for it.     21. A  proposal was brought forward, under  which, in an Irish ParliamentUnionists should have a temporary representation largely  in excess of what they areentitled to on the basis of population.  While appreciating the spirit of this offer itwas felt, after full  consideration, that the undemocratic character of this proposalrendered it wholly unacceptable.     22. On the Land Question a Report containing  valuable suggestions was sub-mitted by the  Committee to which the subject had been referred.  This Report wasunanimously adopted as there, was a desire amongst  all  sections to have the greatregenerative scheme of Land Purchase  completed without further delay.     23. The Committee appointed to consider the urgent necessity  for, providingadditional Workmen&apos;s houses in Urban Districts reported in favour of comprehensiveschemes being at once undertaken by the  Local Authorities, an Imperial grant  inaid to  be provided by the Treasury.  This Report was also unanimously  adopted.     24. We regret  that instead of proposals being made to remove our objections,the policy pursued  by the Nationalists in  the Convention strengthened our opinionthat Home Rule would intensify existing divisions in Ireland and prove a constantmenace to the Empire.    Had  we thought that the majority  of the  Convention intended to demand, not the subordinate powers contained in previous Home Rule Bills,  but  what is  tantamount  to full  national independence, we could not have agreed to enter the  Convention.     25. While firmly believing  that Home Rule would be inimical  to  the highest interests of Ireland and the Empire, Ulster Unionists, with the object of meeting the Nationalists,  presented an alternative scheme for the exclusion of Ulster based  on lines agreed to by the Official Nationalist Party in 1916.     26.  The  discussions have proved beyond doubt that the aim of the Nationalists is to establish a Parliament in Ireland which would be practically free from effective control by the Imperial Parliament.   It is only necessary to draw attention to modern political movements to realise the unwisdom of  establishing  within the United Kingdom two  Parliaments having co-equal powers.   All  other countries have fought against this disintegrating policy.     27.  The  Australian States,  weary of local commercial disputes, combined in one fiscal  unit in  which they were joined by Tasmania an Island  much akin to Ireland in the matter, of area.     28.  The  United States of America established, at the cost of much blood and treasure, National  unity when the Confederacy claimed,  like the Irish Nationalists, the right to set up  an Independent Government.     29.  With these and other examples before us we cannot  help feeling that the demands put forward,, if conceded, would create turmoil at  home and weakness abroad.E
    30. One of the many objection to the Scheme presented in the Report is that itwould make the future application of Federalism to the United Kingdom impossible.    31. For the reasons stated we could not accept the proposals put forward by theNationalists.    32. We desire to record our appreciation of the uniform courtesy and  goodfeeling which characterised the proceedings of the Convention throughout.                       HUGH T.

We have not found it possible to vote for the conclusion reached by the majorityof the members of this Convention.   It involves, in our opinion, either of two alternatives :        (1). The coercion of Ulster, which  is unthinkable.       (2). The partition of Ireland, which would be disastrous.   We have more than once put forward  a Federal Scheme based on the Swissor  Canadian precedent, which might ensure a  united Ireland with  provincialautonomy for Ulster, or any other Province  that desired it.   This scheme would also be capable of being adapted to some larger scheme ofImperial Federation for the  whole British Empire.                               J. P.

REPORTBY  THEUNDERSIGNED  NATIONALISTS.     1. The object set before the Convention was to frame a Constitution for. Irelandwithin the Empire.   This was the first time the Government had assigned such acommission to a body of Irishmen, and we approached the task with a deep senseof the gravity of the circumstances in which the  idea of the Convention originatedas well as of the responsibility which rested upon us of giving the best answer inour power  to a reference of such supreme importance.     2. Though its function was to draft a Constitution, the Convention was not aConstituent Assembly with a direct mandate from the people to plan the form ofGovernment under which they desired to live. Still it might well claim a considerablemeasure of authority for its proceedings. .  Except for some important political andlabour abstentions it has worthily reflected  almos.t every phase and interest  and classin the varied life of Ireland.   But there has been no sure means of knowing howfar it exhibited the mind and will of Ireland at the present time, even as regardsthe parties officially represented in it, nor any guarantee that its decisions, inde-pendentiy of suggestions made by the Government, would take effect in law.  TheSinn Fein organisation stood altogether aloof.     3. Nevertheless, whatever the difficulties might be, we determined to  make themost of the unique opportunity that presented itself when Irishmen  of  opposingparties were for the first  time to  come together  in a large  body to discuss  infriendship the future government of their  country at a great crisis in the woiid&apos;shistory.    To  co-operate  in  devising  a  scheme  of  National  self-governmentwhich would  satisfy the reasonable aspirations of our,  fellow-countrjonen, andprovide adequate safeguards for minorities, was altogether according to our desires.We believed that if a measure giving  us full control  over our own affairs wasagreed to, and given  effect  to by the  Government,  the  vast majority  of IrishNationalists  would accept  it and bend  their minds to making  it a success, andthat the good will to the Constitution which had followed self-government in theDominions would speedily  spring up here.     4. Such hopes as were entertained of success in building a worthy edifice fromthese foundations were strengthened by the preliminary debates of the Convention,which were upon a high level, and showed a real desire for mutual enlightenmentand understanding.   It looked as  if the gravity  of the  times,  the principles offreedom  for which the Allied Nations claimed to stand, the widespread desire fora settlement throughout the Dominions and among our  American kindred, andthe disastrous consequences of  further conflict and disunion, might bring about aspontaneous  resolve  among all the assembled delegates to  establish our country asa free and contented nation  within  the Empire.     5. These expectations have been only in part realised.   The Southern Unionistdelegates, abandoning a long tradition of  opposition to Home Rule, came forwardfrankly and fairly to assist in planning a scheme of self-government.  We readily
acknowledge the patriotism of their  action,  and we can only regret  deeply thaton one point, the control of Customs, which we regarded as vital, they could not-see?eve to eye with us, and thus effect a complete mutual agreement on a Constitution.     6. The Labour delegates also took a very useful part in the deliberations.  As.abody they were strongly in favour of  a measure of self-government for Ireland.     7. On the other hand, the Ulster Unionists, who were in close touch with their-supporters in  the  North,  to  our  great regret did not see their way to give muchco-oper,ation in constructive work along the lines which the  Convention wasfollowing.  The  objections  which they  formulated to our  proposals  would,  ifgiven effect to, reduce the Irish  Parliament to a low level at the outset.  Whattheir view might be in an Irish  Parliament is a different matter.  Every one ofthe Dominions contained  a  minority  of citizens accustomed to identify themselveswith Imperial interests who predicted a calamity for. their country and the wholeEmpire if self-government were fully conceded.   We are confident that the experir- ence of the Convention will tend to remove any such  feeling in Ulster; and, in order to  make it easy for our esteemed fellow-countrymen to join on  fair terms in One Parliament for the whole  country,  we went  so  far as to concede them a largemeasure of additional elected representation in the Irish House of Commons. They would be a powerful and effective element in an Irish Parliament.               :-;     8. We realised clearly from  the outset that to obtain an agreement upon Home Pule for a United Ireland, and thus fulfil the purpose of the Convention, compromise was necessary.   But we also realised that to car,ry compromise to  the point of agreeing to a.scheme which, in  our  judgment, Ireland would not  accept from us&apos; would  be very  unwise,  apart  from  our own  decided  opinions on  the right solution of the Irish problem.  The  truth is, that it is in the control by Irishmen of the machinery of Irish Government rather than in a reduction of the powers of the Irish Parliament that the best field is to be found for a reasonable compromise. This brings us to the recommendations of our Report.                -                  -                                    -s -        i     -. -&apos;-; . &quot;   .&apos;.;i 7     9. The terms of reference given to the Convention contained the single limitation that the Constitution must  be within the Empire.                              s      10. Within the Empire and  peculiar to it, ther.e  is a form of  Constitution^ enjoyed by all the self-governing Dominions, which has brought peace, contentment and prosperity to those nations, together with an attachment to the Empire which&quot; has grown steadily firmer, even  after rebellion and  open war.  This form of; Constitution rests  on three main principles (1) the Imperial Parliament retains full control over  all Imperial affairs,  foreign relations, the making  of peace and war, the Army and Navy.  (2) The Dominion Parliament is technically  a subordinate one. whose Bills  must receive the Royal Assent to become valid, and whose Acts may legally  be  over-ridden by  the Imperial Parliament.    (3) Subject to thesQ limitations, the Dominion has  unfettered power of national self-government, iii-  cluding full  control of all taxation.      11. Ireland  is a Nation, and it is upon a like foundation that we believe the Irish Constitution should now be built.  There is room for compromise on details, and  even on secondary questions of principle, and there is abundant room for compromise  of the wisest kind in the  form of safeguards  for. the minorities inside  Ireland;.  without limiting the powers of Ireland as a whole.   But we think it essential to  abide by the principle that Irish affairs, including  all  branches of taxation, should  be under the Irish Parliament.                                              &apos;  -&apos;S     . 12. It has often been said  in our debates, and outside them, that it would be unsafe for Great Britain to permit an island so near  her to have political power  resembling in any degree  that  of the Dominions.   As regards national  defence,  we have allowed a difference to  exist; and in the matter of trade there is room for  a special arrangement.  But, as to the  rest, we can only reply that  reconciliation  between the  two  countries  is made exceedingly difficult unless it can be  shown that  the British people sincerely believe in liberty for.its Own sake, and are willing;  to apply to  Ireland the principle  that the supposed  military  interests of great
states shall not over-ride the rights .of small nationalities living  alongside them.The noble principle of liberty, which has had such a unifying effect in the Dominionsduring the war now devastating Europe surely cannot lose its virtue when appliedto an island near to Great  Britain, where  mutual  interests and intimate com-mercial relations  ought to promise an even closer friendship.    13. While we think, therefore, that any settlement founded on distrust of Irelandwill, fail in  its effect,  and that the nearer, the Irish Constitution approaches tothat of the Dominions the better will be its prospects, we have striven with earnestsincerity to meet  the opposition of Unionist minorities in Ireland, and allay theirfears with safeguards which do not infringe any vital principle.   We take in turnthe points where  difference has arisen, and the proposals which  we make for corn-promise.    14. Customs and Excise.  The principal point of  difference arose on finance.We asked for full powers of taxation.   The Ulster representatives wished to reserveall powers of taxation to the Imperial Parliament, and only modified this demandto the extent of allowing to the Irish Parliament some undefined taxing power ofits own.  The Southern Unionists were prepared to concede direct taxation andExcise to the Irish Parliament, and admitted the reasonableness of Ireland&apos;s claimto separate Customs treatment by proposing an arrangement which, in effect, wouldplace  a moral  obligation  upon  the  Imperial  Parliament of  imposing lowerCustoms duties  in Ireland than in Great Britain  upon articles  of general  con-sumption.  They could not see their way to go further and allow the Irish Parlia-ment control over Customs.   Ultimately they acquiesced in a proposition from theGovernment that leaves the control of Customs and  Excise to the decision of theImperial Parliament after the war.   In an Irish Parliament  we have no doubtthat many of them would claim the fiscal autonomy which more than one of themadvocated in the earlier stages of the Convention.     15.  The taxing power so deeply affects the welfare and prosperity of the people,the dignity of Parliament, and the wise and economical administration  of the Government, that no  part of  it could be placed under external control withoutperpetuating  friction  with  Great Britain and  discontent  in  Ireland.   Thecontrol of indirect taxation, which determines the course of trade and  in normaltimes produced seventy per cent,  of Irish tax-revenue,  is of especial importance.Irish Government cannot be financed without drawing largely on these  sources  ofrevenue, nor can an equitable balance  between direct  and indirect taxation  beobtained if two  authorities instead of one  are controlling them.   Moreover, theindirect taxes affect  articles  of general consumption  among the  mass  of thepopulation,  including  necessaries of life.     16. Economically, Ireland is, and always has been, different from Great Britain.It is a much poorer country, and a country with few  manufacturing industries.It has  suffered severely from over-taxation  under the Union, and urgently needsa separate  fiscal system under Irish  control.   There  is not  an  instance in theworld  of an island differing so radically from  a  powerful neighbouring- countrybeing united with it under a common fiscal  system.     17. No exception can be made in the case of Customs, which, under the present free trade system, comprise the duties on such important  articles as sugar, tea, coffee and tobacco.  Moreover fiscal systems  everywhere  are in the melting pot, and there is a likelihood of radical change in the British  system.   No change  could possibly affect Ireland and Great Britain in the same way, and we consider  it neces- sary that Ireland should have the right of  guarding her own trade interests and controlling her own trade policy.   It may  be said  with  truth that the power, of each state within the Empire to control the whole of its own taxation, and especially its Customs, is the very corner-stone of Imperial unity.      18. Federation is not in view.  Even if  it were, and Ireland were still intent on  retaining control of her Customs, her  sea boundary  and her  distinct  national  character and economic interests would give her a claim  in that respect which no  member of a federation anywhere else can advance.
    19. It lias been said that to give the Irish Government the power of negotiatingcommercial arrangements with foreign  countries will complicate foreign relationsand place her in an unwarrantably privileged position.   We answer that no suchcomplications arise in the case of the Dominions, and that what we ask for implies,in our own  case as in theirs, no  diminution of, Imperial authority.   Any suchtrade  arrangement has to be negotiated through the agency of the  Colonial Office,as representing the  Imperial Government, in which the treaty-making power aloneresides.    20. Another objection was the inconvenience to trade if a Customs barrier wereset up and ships were searched for dutiable articles.  But the system was in forcehere until the middle  of  the last century.   It still prevails in trade, not only withAmerica,  France, and foreign countries  generally, but  with the Dominions,  theCrown Colonies, and  even the Channel Islands.   It is, moreover, the only effectivemeans of ascertaining what the true income of Ireland amounts to.  The revenueat present attributed  to  Ireland in respect of tea and other dutiable commoditiesis official guesswork, founded mainly on the numbers of the population.    21. But the strongest objection made to the control  of Customs, an objectionurged principally by  the Ulster Unionists, was that it might interrupt free tradebetween Ireland and  Great Britain.   They stated that the raw materials of Ulsterindustry were drawn mainly from Great Britain, which was also the market for muchof their finished produce,  and that close commercial intercourse was thereforeessential.   But this is true also of Irish agriculture, for whose products, which areperishable, and are  exported in normal times to a greater value than the products ofall the Ulster industries  combined, Great Britain is at the present time the best  andpractically the only market.  It would be folly to offend our  best customer.     22. As both countries are so  deeply  interested in free  access to one  another&apos;smarkets, we believe that mutual advantage would be a surer guarantee of free  andfriendly intercourse than any legal. restrictions.   But, in order to meet  Unionistfears, we are ready to agree to provisions in the Constitutional Act maintainingfree trade between  the two countries in articles of home produce,  subject to safe-guards against dumping, for a reasonable term of years,  and thereafter by mutualagreement.   This  would ensure that  if  any change became  absolutely necessary,owing either to an altered  tariff policy in Great Britain, or to any other reason,it could not  be made without prolonged deliberation in  the Irish Parliament.     23. We desire to recall the fact that in proposing full powers of taxation for Ireland we are not making a new or unsupported  claim. The  three most eminent financial  authorities  upon  the Financial Relations Commission of 1895   Lord Farrer, Lord Welby, and Mr. Bertram Currie reported in  a powerful reasonedargument, while disclaiming all political prepossessions, that this was the onlysound method of  solving the question.    The Primrose Committee of  financialexperts, no longer  ago than 1911, unanimously and with equal emphasis reportedto the same  effect,  recommending  the Irish control of Customs  with arrangementsfor free trade between the  two countries.   None of the arguments used by thesehigh authorities, after  exhaustive investigation, have lost their weight, and somehave gained strength.      24. The Act of  1914, which gives  Ireland some restricted powers in regard  to Customs, contains  in Section 26 a distinct guarantee that when Irish revenue  had met Irish expenditure for three successive years, the financial arrangements would be revised for the express purpose of increasing the powers of the Irish Parliament over  taxation, as well as for settling an  Imperial  contribution.  The condition  is now  fulfilled.  A large  balance of revenue over expenditure has been growing for three years, and it can no longer be said that an estimated deficit justifies  any curtailment  of Irish  control over  Irish finance.      25. We fully agree that there should be some regular machinery for. ensuring close co-operation  between Great Britain  and Ireland  in  commercial and postal matters; and we, therefore, propose the establishment of a Joint Advisory Corn- mission with power  to make agreements and recommendations  on  these important matters.
:,  ;  26.  The Imperial Contribution.  A most important financial question is the;nature and. amount of the contribution to be made by Ireland to Imperial services.-The obligation of Ireland to contribute according to her means we accept without-question.  As to the method, our view is that this is another case where the greatesti wisdom  would lie in  following the Dominion precedent that is, in making the matter one of voluntary negotiation between the Irish and Imperial Governments,yfche contribution taking the form of  payment for services of an Imperial nature, as by the maintenance of forces for local defence or the provision of ships.  Ireland, on her side, would renounce all claim to subsidies or  payments of any kind  from the&apos;British  Exchequer.  This would make a clean financial settlement.    Great Britain would not be exacting what many might regard as tribute.   Ireland would wipe out bitter  memories of over-taxation and  neglect,  and face the future not only as a self-reliant country, but as a more willing because a moi;e free contributor&apos;to the common  defence.  It must be recognised that if  this plan is not adopted and a statutory contribution is  to be enforced by law, there  is no logical course but to r.e-open intricate questions of taxable capacity, which will inevitably bring into prominence the over-taxation of Ireland in the past, and will be held to justify claims for  compensation. 1   .27. In  view of strong Unionist  feeling, however, we do  not press our views upon  the  point,  and are willing to agree to  a statutory  payment,  to be fixed provisionally at  the  outset  and  afterwards  by agreement between the Imperial and  Irish  Governments.   We only stipulate that the annual expenses of  Land&quot;Purchase,  which must be regarded as an Imperial  obligation,  though an  Irish ; service, as well as the cost of any defence forces that may be raised and maintained In the future by the Irish Government, shall be set off  against the sum so  fixed. The same applies, in a large measure, to the Housing scheme.  The balance could best be paid in kind by the provision of ships or other war material manufactured&apos; in Ireland.      28. Local Forces.  Any settlement which prohibited Ireland, as a matter of principle, from providing military forces for her. own local defence in the  consti- i -tutional manner,customary in the Dominions would, in our opinion, be unacceptable. The confidence shown by entrusting her with such a power would,  we are convinced, be repaid  a, thousandfold.   But here, again, we have felt it our,  duty to give way to cautious views, and we propose that  the power should remain in abeyance for five years,  and should then depend on the consent of the Imperial Conference, upon which Ireland should be duly represented. 1,  .-. !&apos; 29. As regards the question of conscription, we are r.eady to take it for granted I that  no attempt would be made to apply it to Ireland without the consent of the /Irish Parliament.   Any attempt to impose conscription upon a nation without its /sanction is utterly impolitic and unjust, and is bound to  end in disaster.      30, Representation at Westminster..  We preferred that this representa- -&apos;tion should cease until such time as a Parliament is created in which all parts of the *&apos;Empire or the Realm could be  properly and  equitably  represented.   Until that  time we believe that every purpose served by representation could be better  served  by arrangements for regular and  systematic  conference between  the Irish  and  British Governments in a permanent consultative council.    By sending members W- the  British  Parliament  at Westminster,  after we have  obtained  a Parliament jof :our own, we risk incurring the  odium of  disturbing the balance of  English &quot;parties and influencing questions on which we  are not concerned,  without any - security that in matters where Ireland is properly concerned her  voice will carry -its due weight, since in order to avoid too much dislocation it is necessary to  reduce  her membership far below  the number to  which her  population entitles her.   But in view of the great importance attached by Unionists to  this representation, we   were reluctant to maintain our opposition, and we accordingly agreed to a delegation :  of 42 Irish members being sent to Westminster by the Irish Parliament.  That is f the form  of representation at Westminster that will least distract Irish attention --from the necessary concentration at homeland least divide the views of our members Jin London from those of the Irish Parliament.
Ifi ;  26.  The Imperial Contribution.  A most important financial question is the-nature and amount of the contribution to be made by Ireland to Imperial services. The obligation of Ireland to contribute according to her means we accept withoutQuestion.  As to the method, our view is that this is another case where the greatestiwisdom  would lie in  following the Dominion precedent that is, in making the/matter one of voluntary negotiation between the Irish and Imperial Governments,rthe contribution taking the form of payment for services of an Imperial nature, as by the maintenance of forces for local defence or the provision of ships.  Ireland, on her side, would renounce all claim to subsidies or  payments of any kind  from the&apos;British Exchequer.  This  would make a clean financial settlement.    Great Britain would not be exacting what  many might regard as tribute.   Ireland would wipe out bitter  memories of over-taxation and  neglect,  and face the future not ohly as a self-reliant country, but as a more willing because a more free contributor-to the common  defence.  It must be recognised that if  this plan is not adopted and a statutory contribution is  to be enforced by law, there is no logical course but to re-open intricate questions of taxable capacity, which will inevitably bring into prominence the over-taxation of Ireland in the past, and will be held to justify claims for compensation.    . 27. In view of strong Unionist feeling, however, we do not press our views upon  the  point,  and are willing to agree to  a statutory  payment,  to be fixed provisionally at  the  outset  and  afterwards  by agreement between the Imperial and  Irish Governments.   We only stipulate that the annual expenses of  Land &quot;Purchase,  which must be regarded as an Imperial  obligation,  though an  Irish ; service, as well as the cost of any defence forces that may be raised and maintained in the future by the Irish Government, shall be set off  against the sum so  fixed. The same applies, in a large measure, to the Housing scheme.  The balance could best be paid in kind by the provision of ships or other war material manufactured fin Ireland.      28. Local Forces.  Any settlement which prohibited Ireland, as a matter of &quot;principle, from providing military forces for her. own local  defence in the  consti- \ tutional manner.customary in the Dominions would, in our opinion, be unacceptable. The confidence shown by entrusting her with such a power would, we are convinced, ;be repaid, a, thousandfold.  But here, again, we have felt it our duty to give way to cautious views, and we propose that the power should remain in abeyance for five years, and should then depend on the consent of the Imperial Conference, upon which Ireland should be duly represented. ., ,,! 29. As regards the question of conscription, we are ready to take it for granted \that no attempt would be made to apply it to Ireland without the consent  of the -Irish Parliament.   Any attempt to impose conscription upon a nation without its -sanction  is &quot;utterly impolitic and unjust, and is bound to end in disaster. ---- -  30. Representation at Westminster.. We preferred that this representa-  tion should cease until such time as a Parliament is created in which all parts of the *; Empire or the Realm could be properly and  equitably  represented.   Until  that  time we believe that every purpose served by representation could  be better seiwed  by  arrangements for  regular and systematic  conference between the  Irish  and  British Governments in a  permanent consultative council.   By sending members  to the British  Parliament  at  Westminster, after  we have obtained a Parliament lof-our own,  we risk incurring the odium of  disturbing the balance of English &apos;&quot;parties aud  influencing questions  on which we are not concerned,  without any ; security  that in matters where Ireland is properly concerned her  voice will carry &quot;-its.due weight, since in order to avoid too much dislocation it is necessary to reduce  her membership far below  the number to  which her population  entitles her.  But  jn view  of the great importance attached by  Unionists  to this  representation, we  were reluctant to maintain our opposition, and we accordingly agreed to a delegation ;;of 42 Irish, members being sent to Westminster by the Irish Parliament.   That is  Uhe form of representation at Westminster that will least distract Irish attention --from the necessary concentration at home, and least divide the views of our members j in London from those of the Irish Parliament.
    31. Safeguards for Minorities.  All the points we have hitherto dealt withare concerned with the future constitutional relations between Ireland and GreatBritain, and the powers  to be exercised by the Irish Parliament.   In regard tosafeguards for minorities in Ireland against any misuse of these powers that theymight fear,  we have  gone to extreme lengths in our anxiety to reach a settlement.    32. That political parties will long continue on existing lines seems most unlikely.But we have agreed  that an Irish House of Commons at the outset shall ha.ve aUnionist strength  of 40 per cent, and that the Upper House shall consist of nomi-nated and ex  officio  members, of peers elected by their  own  order, and of othermembers elected by their own class.  The two Houses would sit and vote togetheron questions in dispute between them, including Money Bills.    33. These arrangements are intended  to  give to commercial  and industrialinterests,  and to Unionist views generally, a powerful voice  in the final decision ofall legislative questions, including financial measures.    34. We are aware that in agreeing to these  arrangements we put a severe strainon the Irish democracy, and hazard the adverse opinion of the outside world.  Butwe take the risk on  condition that full powers of self-government, especially full economic  and financial powers, are entrusted to the Parliament  so  constituted.We believe  the guarantee offered against the wrongful and imprudent exercise of these.powers to be needless.  But, provided that Irish  questions  are left to thedecision of  the Irish Parliament, we trust our countrymen of North, South, Eastand West to act loyally and patriotically in the interests of Ireland.    35. The nomination of some Members to the Lower House appears to be the onlysure and  practicable way of providing adequate minority  representation  for the Southern  Unionists.   In  the case of the Ulster Unionists,  who prefer  election, we should be willing  to agree to securing larger representation for them by arranging for smaller electoral quotas or for any electoral expedient  which would effect the desired result.   As regards the Ulster  difficulty, we know of  no other plan which would  not  impair  the  efficiency  ef  Parliament  and  keep in  being religious antagonisms which all good  Irishmen desire to see ended.     36. Civil Service  Commissions.   We  propose the  establishment of fairjy constituted Civil  Service Commissions to regulate competitive  examinations and advise on all patronage and appointments.     37. Temporary Arrangements during the War.   So far from thinking that the war should further delay the establishment of an Irish Executive and Parlia- ment, we regard a postponement of these measures as a disaster and their prompt passage into law an advantage which no administrative difficulties should be allowed to thwart.  We recognise, however,  that the abnormal conditions brought about by the war  make it  difficult to carry out some of the changes required.   We do not think these difficulties ought to be magnified.  The advantage gained by proofs of a sincere desire to let the Irish people manage their own affairs will far outweigh disturbance of official routine.  But, if it is clearly laid down that any reserved Dower will be operative  immediately after the  war, a certain  amount of postpone- ment  is  admissible.   What we altogether object to is the postponement  of vital questions until after the  war.   Now is the time to decide them in principle. This makes it impossible for us to agree to any suggestions made by the Government during our deliberations to  leave the future of Customs and Excise  in  complete uncertainty.    m 38.  No doubt it might be difficult to transfer the control of these two services-jduring the war, and we therefore consent to  their temporary maintenance undermmperial authority.   But a Joint Board should be immediately set up to determine the true  revenue  of  Ireland from these taxes,  and to allocate their proceeds, as so determined, to the Irish Exchequer.                                                                        F
    39. We do not like to contemplate even a temporary reservation of the Police orPost Office.   But, to meet  the views of others, we have  agreed that the Imperialand Irish Governments may jointly arrange for the unified control of either serviceduring the war.    40. Land Purchase..  It is an important part of any scheme for the settlementof the Irish question that  Land Purchase should be completed on terms equitablealike  to landlord and tenant; that the administration should be Irish, and that thefull cost of Land Purchase, past and future, should  be borne by the Irish Govern-ment, on the understanding that it be reckoned as part of Ireland&apos;s contribution toImperial services.  Happily, no serious  difference of opinion has arisen in theConvention on the proposals framed by the able Committee which dealt with LandPurchase, and we recommend that a measure embodying  the scheme outlined in itsReport shall be annexed to the Constitutional Act.                                SUMMARY.    41. To sum up, we propose a Constitution conferring powers on Ireland whichare strictly consistent with Imperial unity and  strictly conform  to the limits setby the reference to the Convention.    42. We propose an Irish Parliament with full powers of legislation in all Irishaffairs, subject to  the religious safeguards contained in Section  3 of the  Act of1914  (the existing disabilities to  be removed  in the Constitutional Act),  and withfull powers of taxation,  but with no power  to make laws on  Imperial  concerns;the Crown, foreign relations, peace and war, the Army and Navy and other alliedmatters duty specified.    43. At the same time, we do our utmost to meet the doubts and objections ofUnionists by agreeing to the following provisions:     (1) Generous additional representation in the Irish Parliament.    (2) A guarantee for a reasonable period of  Free Trade between Ireland  and           Great Britain in articles which  are the produce or manufacture of           either country.    (3) A Joint Advisory Commission to secure co-operation  in commercial  and           postal matters.    (4)  Continued representation in the Imperial Parliament in such  a  way as           to reflect the  views of the different parties in the Irish Parliament.    (5)  A fixed statutory contribution to Imperial expenses.     (6)  Independent Civil Service Commissions.     (7)  Suspension for  a term of years of the power to raise local defence forces.     (8)  Suspension till the end of the war of the powers over Customs and Excise.           with an arrangement  to be made  by joint agreement for the control of           Police  and Post Office by the two Governments for a like period. We also agree to the scheme adopted by the  Convention for the speedy completion of Land Purchase, and express our concurrence in the Housing scheme.
                            - CONCLUSION.    44. Such a Constitution would, we believe, meet with the approval of the greatmajority of the people of Ireland.  It would be accepted by our kindred in theUnited States and Colonies.  It is generous to the Irish Unionists, and good forGreat Britain as well as for  Ireland.    Had  it been put into operation at thebeginning of the war, the World&apos;s history might have been very different  in thesedeciding years.  Better, late than never.                  )JtJ.  M.

                             NOTE                               BY THEMAJORITY   OF   THE   NATIONALISTS.    1. In order to reach an  agreement between Unionists and Nationalists, we donot at this moment desire to press our objection to the fiscal proposals contained inthe Prime  Minister&apos;s letter, as we hold it to be of  paramount importance that anIrish  Parhament with  an  Executive responsible thereto should be  immediatelyestablished, and that,  concurrently with the  legislation necessary to effect thatobject, measures should be passed  by the Imperial Parliament to provide for theentire completion of Land Purchase and the solution of the Housing Problem.     2. In  coming to this decision we are largely moved by the belief that the Govern-ment we are helping to establish will be an effective instrument in obtaining forIreland by general consent whatever further powers her material interests require;and that the proposal  to paj^ into  the  Irish Exchequer the full proceeds of Irishtaxation,  direct  and indirect,  subject only  to  an agreed contribution to  Imperialexpenditure, will give the Irish Government means for internal development, andwill prevent the ruinous increase of burdens which would certainly result if Irelandremained liable to the  full weight of Imperial taxation, and jointly responsible forthe Imperial debt.  *     3. But since the decision upon Ireland&apos;s claim to full fiscal autonomy is  onlypostponed, we, the undersigned, desire to put on  record against the time when thatdecision has to  be made, our conviction that, according to  all precedents in theBritish Empire, an Irish Parliament is entitled, and ought to become the sole taxingauthority  for Ireland, unless and until, in the general interest it sees fit to part withsome portion of its financial independence.  We hold, however, that in the commoninterest of both countries there should  be a Free Trade  agreement between GreatBritain and Ireland.     4. We dCsire to add that we protest most strongly against the suggestion thatalternative sittings of the Irish Parliament might be held in some other place  thanDublin, and also against the proposal  that there  should be  set up  anywhere  inIreland other than in Dublin a complete branch  of the Irish administration.5&quot;   *Lord MacDonnell is unable to participate in this paragraph for the  following reasons: thismatter was never raised or discussed in the Convention, and without the fullest discussion heabstains from expressing an opinion on it; Lord MacDonnell is well aware that the proposal wouldgive rise to vehement opposition in Leinster, Munster and Connaught, and probably amongst theNationalist population of Ulster; it would certainly impose many hardships upon the great majorityof  the Irish people; and would unquestionably be productive of  extreme administrative incon-venience.  But so strong is Lord MacDonnelFs desire to meet all reasonable wishes of the Unionistsof Ulster that he feels unable to negative the proposal without having before him the Ulster Unionistviews upon the point.
    5. We further  hold that, by the Act constituting an Irish Parliament, powershould be taken to prevent dumping, and we believe that this could most convenientlybe done by prohibiting the export  from  Great Britain to Ireland, and vice versa,of any article which is being sold under the cost of its production-   It should bemade a duty of the Joint Exchequer Board to enquire into alleged cases of dumping,.and action should originate on a report from them.

We recognise that an agreement could not have been brought about withoutcertain temporary concessions made in regard to the Constitution of  the IrishParhament which we, as democrats and representatives of  Labour, regard withstrong dislike.   But we feel so deeply the necessity of setting up a Parliament inIreland, in which Labour  amongst other interests, may be able to find a place, thatwe have been willing to  subordinate our democratic beliefs to what we conceiveto be the  highest interests of Ireland.                                SENATE.    3. As to the constitution of the Senate  we are still totally opposed to the nomi-nated element believing same should be elected on a democratic vote if Labour isi;o be given a chance to be represented in that body by its own choice.  So strongly-do we feel on this point that we are prepared to recommend our fellow  workmennot to accept nomination to&apos; the chamber.    4. As  a compromise  we  are prepared to agree with  the nominations as out-lined in Head 9, sub-heads (1) to (5).                          HOUSE  OF COMMONS.    5. We are of opinion  that the elected members of  the Irish House of Commons,like the members of the Imperial House of Commons, and of the principal Legislaturesin the British Dominions, should receive a salary which we suggest should be atthe rate of  400 per annum.                             FRANCHISE.    6. We are of opinion that the Representation of the People Act, 1918,  shouldcontinue to be the law governing the franchise in Ireland.JAMES  McCARRON.HENRY  T.

343                   NOTE                        BYTHE   EARL    OF    DUNRAVEN.    In signing the Report I desire to say:     I. I regret that no recommendation is made in favour of a Grand Committee-composed  of Ulster representatives in the  new  Irish  Parliament, who  would beempowered to supervise legislative and administrative action seriously affecting theinterests of that province.    II. In my opinion Federalism is the best principle upon which to base a Union.that will give Ireland the fullest measure of self-government, that will enable thenew Irish Constitution to fit hito complete federation of the United Kingdom whenthe appropriate time comes, and to form a consistent link in the chain that may lead-to Constitutional synthesis within the Empire.                                                   *    III. I regret, therefore, that the Convention did not proceed on &quot;more definiteFederal lines, but the decisions arrived at are not incompatible with a Federal system;.they mark reconciliation between hitherto antagonistic bodies of public opinionthey indicate the lines which legislation should follow,  and I accept them without,further reservation.DUNRAVEN.
    We think it necessary to add to the Report of the Proceedings of the Conventiona, brief  statement of our position, because the Resolution introduced by us  onJanuary 2nd, 1918, was, owing to circumstances, not brought to a decision.    1. We desire to record our  unaltered conviction that the Legislative Unionprovides the  best system of government for Ireland, but having entered the Con-vention on an appeal from H.M. Government, based on high considerations of Alliedand Imperial interests which it was impossible to disregard, we have endeavouredto assist the Convention in devising a Constitution which would meet the aspirationsfor self-government within the Empire long held by  a great  majority of the Irishpeople.    2. We believe that an Irish Parhament can only be estabhshed with safety toImperial interests and security for the minority in Ireland, by the participation ofIrishmen of various classes and creeds hi the government which is rendered possibleby  the  safeguards agreed  with  practical unanimity by the Convention and forwhich no provision was made mider the Act of 1914.    3. We regard the following points as vital to airy satisfactory settlement, andour action must be subject to  these conditions :       (1). That  Ireland occupy  the same position  as other parts of the United             Kingdom in any scheme for the  Federation of the Empire or  the             United  Kingdom.      (2). That all Imperial questions and services, hicluding the levying of Customs             Duties,  be left in the hands  of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.      (3). That  Ireland send  representatives to Westminster.      (4). That  the  whole of  Ireland participate in any Irish Parhament.      (5). That the safeguards in the Report agreed to by the Convention be  estab-             hshed.      (6). That  an adequate contribution be made by Ireland to Imperial services.    Our lamented colleague, Sir Henry Blake, expressed by letter hi January last his-concurrence with us  on the above points.

LETTER  FROM   THE   PRIME  MINISTER   TO   MR.   J.   REDMOND                              REGARDING   IRELAND.                       -  -  Parliamentary Paper,. 1917, (Cd. 8573.)DEAR MR. REDMOND,    THE Government have been considering forsome time what further action they could take tobring about a settlement of  the Irish  question.They have approached the subject  with a deepdesire to put an end to a state of affairs &quot;which isproductive  of immense  evil not only to  Irelandbut  to  Great Britain and the Empire.  Thechoice of alternatives open to them, however, hasbeen narrowed by the fact that it is impossiblefor them, in the crisis of a war in which our safetyand  the hberty of most of the nations of Europeis  at stake, to take  action which would reviveviolent  political  controversy  and  so weaken orimperil the unity which is essential to the supremenecessity of WINNING the war. They have thereforefelt  that any settlement which they could pro-pose during the war must be one which would besubstantially accepted  by  both  sides. Theywould have wished in  accordance  with  thisprinciple to enter upon  negotiations  with theIrish representatives, but this, as  you know, wasimpossible,  owing to  the decision of your partynot to negotiate with the Government.   The idea of the Government has been to try toeffect an immediate  settlement,  conceding thelargest possible measure of Home Rule which canbe secured by agreement at this  moment, with-out  prejudice to the undertaking  by Parhamentof a further and final  settlement of the questionsmost in  dispute, after the war.  They are there-fore  prepared to put forward proposals on the fol-lowing lines, with a  view  to present action.   Firstly,  they  would introduce  a  Bill-for theimmediate application of the Home Rule Act toIreland, but excluding therefrom the six countiesof North-East Ulster,  such exclusion to be subiectto&apos; reconsideration by Parliament at the end offive  years, unless it  is previously terminated bythe  action of the Council of Ireland, to be set upas hereinafter described.   Secondly, with  a view to securing the largestpossible measure of common action for the wholeof Ireland,  the Bill would provide for  a Councilof Ireland to be composed of two delegations, con- sisting,  on the  one hand,  of  all the membersreturned to Westminster from the excluded area, and, on the other, of a delegation eaual in num-bers from the Irish Parliament.    This Councilcould be summoned on the initiative  of any six members.   It would be empowered by a majority of votes of each  of the delegations (a) to  pass private Bill legislation affecting both the included and the excluded area; (b) to recommend to the Crown  the extension to the  excluded  area by               10, DOWNING STREET,                   WHITEHALL, S.W. 1,                            loth May, 1917.Order in Council of any Act of  the Irish Parlia-ment; (c) to  agree  to  the inclusion under theHome Rule Act of the  whole of Ireland, subjectto the assent of the majority of the voters in theexcluded area, power to be vested in the Crownin that  case to extend  the Act to aU Ireland byOrder in Council; (d) to make recommendationson its own initiative upon Irish questions, includ-ing the  amendment of the Home Rule Act asfinally passed.  The President of this Council of Ireland wouldbe elected by agreement between the delegations,or in default of agreement he would be nominatedby the Crown.  Thirdly,  the Government  consider  that thefinancial proposals  of  the Home Rule  Act areunsatisfactory  and ought  to  be  reconsidered.There are a number of important objects, such asthe development of Irish industries, the improve-ment of housing in the towns, and the furtheranceof  education  (including  a   better   scale ofremuneration for teachers), which cannot, owingto changed  conditions  which have  arisen sincethe war, be adequately dealt with under the pro-visions  of that Act without imposing an undueburden on the Irish taxpayer.  Fourthly,  the Government  would recommendthat,  after second reading, the Bill embodyingthe above proposals, together with the Home RuleAct, should be forthwith  considered  by a confer -ence  to be  constituted  on  the lines of theSpeakers  Conference   on  Electoral  Reform,though not consisting exclusively of Members ofParliament, and meeting under the chairmanshipof someone commanding the  same  general  con-fidence  in his impartiality and judgment as Mr.Speaker  himself.   The   conference would, ofcourse, have full power to suggest any alterationsin the Government scheme upon which it mightdecide.  The Government feel  that a proposal which pro-vides for immediate Home Rule for the greaterpart of Ireland, while excluding that part of Ire-land which objects to  coming under the HomeRule Act, for a definite period  after which  Par-liament will consider the matter afresh; which re-cognises the  profound  sentiment existing in Ire-land for the  unity of the country by  creating  acommon council  to consider  Irish  affairs as  awhole;  which,  finally,  sets up a representativeConference to attempt to adjust the most difficultquestions involved, is as far as they can possiblygo  towards effecting a legislative settlement inthe crisis of a great war.
  They are prepared to introduce a Bill on theselines.  But they feel that it would be idle,  and Iam sure you will agree with them, to introducesuch a Bill  unless it were assured of somethinglike a second reading acceptance from both Irishparties.  I sincerely hope that if the Governmentintroduce this Bill the party of which you are thehead will give  this  measure of support to pro-posals which will give immediate self-governmentin Ireland to those who  wish for it, and will atthe same time create and keep continuously inbeing the means whereby a  final  reconciliationbetween the two sections of the Irish people  canat any time  be brought about.  We earnestly recommend the proposals which Ihave  outlined above to the  dispassionate con-sideration of men of all parties.  If &quot;upon suchconsideration a basis for  immediate  action isfound in them we shall proceed at once with thenecessary steps to carry them into effect.  If this should not be  the case  there remainsan  alternative plan  which, though  it has beensometimes  seriously  discussed, has  never beenauthoritatively  proposed: that of assembling  aConvention of Irishmen of all parties for the.pur-pose of producing a scheme of Irish self-govern-ment.  As you will remember the constitution of theUnion  of South Africa was framed, despite mostformidable difficulties  and obstacles, by a  Con-vention representative of all the interests  andparties in the country, and the Government be-lieves that a similar expedient might, in the lastresort,  be found  effectual in Ireland.  Would itbe too  much to hope that Irishmen  of all creedsand parties might meet together in a Conventionfor the purpose of drafting a Constitution for theircountry which should secure a just balance of allthe opposing interests and finally compose theunhappy discords which  have so long distractedIreland and impeded its  harmonious develop-ment ?  The Government is ready, in default ofthe adoption of their present proposals for HomeBule,  to  take  the. necessary steps  for the as-sembling of such  a Convention.  I should be much obliged if  you found it pos-sible to give me your views on this letter in order&quot;to allow the  Government to consider the matterbefore  Monday.               .  Yours sincerely,                  .   D.  LLOYD GEORGE.

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,  On Tuesday next, the necessary preparationshaving  been  made, we shall enter  upon  thedefinite task entrusted to us, the search for a pos-sible basis of agreement  between  the differentsections  of  our  countrymen upon the  futuregovernment of our country.  The historic importance of the occasion, and myown special responsibility in regard to it, move meto send you in advance some thoughts upon cer-tain aspects of the work before us.   I desire moreparticularly  to  explain the procedure for  ourcoming  deliberations,  w,hich you  approved  inprinciple at the Session of  August 8-9, as it hassince been elaborated by. your Grand Committee.I do so because the plan adopted is as unprece-dented as the  situation for which it was devised.  Those who  tell  us  that  our  best  meant en-deavours  must come  to  naught  have  amplegrounds&apos; for  their  pessimism in  the  history ofsimilar efforts. They see us confronted with a taskwhich has baffled generation after  generation ofthe British people called upon to  overcome thedifficulties notoriously  incidental to the work offraming  a constitution.   We have  to resolvethese difficulties in a time of grave domestic un-rest, in an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion,and in the midst  of the greatest war in humanhistory!   It is true that this is the first attempt.to get the Irish question settled by Irishmen inIreland.   But, even so, no man of sense wouldexpect it to succeed unless inside the Conventionsome wholly  new  spirit were to  prevail.    Myhopes rest upon the fact that already this neces-sary condition has  been supplied.   For the firsttime, an opportunity has been afforded to revealthe whole of the Irish mind, and the whole of theIrish heart, not to the foreigner whom we  haveto  impress and perhaps are sometimes temptedto fool, but to each other as man to man, with thecommon  aim  of  the  welfare of  our commoncountry.   It must be admitted, however, that the best will in the world will not avail unless the right way befound.  After searching the precedents of analo-gous conventions  and conferences, a  great dealmay be learned; but the final conclusion must bethat no analogy is perfect, and that a wholly newmethod of approach to the great difficulties of our task must be discovered.   This much has, I be- lieve, been  accomplished.   In devising the procedure best  calculated to secure ordered,  harmonious, relevant,  and there- fore fruitful, discussion in the Convention we had to take into account the circumstances of its mem- bers&apos; lives.   We have most of us some acquaint- ance with public affairs, but very few of us have made a close  study of political science and insti- tutions.   In order, therefore, to  take a useful part in the coming deliberations we shall nearly all of us need a certain minimum of preparation.   We must, of course, have a general knowledgeKILTERAGH,    FOXROCK,       Co.  DUBLIN,            nth August, 1917.of the main factors in our political problem andof the various solutions which are known to  beseriously proposed.   We ought, also, to be fairlyfamiliar with the manner in which similar prob-lems have been solved in other parts of the world,more  particularly in the Dominions of the Com-monwealth to which we belong.   This knowledgeis being supplied to us from the  Secretariat andwill continue to be supplied as the occasion de-mands.  Furthermore,  any  members  wishingeither to present proposals of their own, or to dis-cuss proposals put forward by others, can obtaintechnical assistance from members of the staff andbe  supplied with  books  from  the  ReferenceLibrary.  So  much for  the  assistance outside  the Con-vection.   I now come to the procedure inside.Before the plan which I shall presently describewas adopted, two other methods were considered.The first was a general discussion upon  the exist-ing system  of government and the best methodof improving it, everybody  being allowed to dis-course at large upon the whole or any part of thisenormous subject.  This plan was rejected on theground that &quot; lean  and profitless debate &quot; mightweary and disgust  business men,  that it  mightlead  to angry controversy  upon some issue  in-opportunely raised,  or that it might &quot; peter out &quot;and leave us still to decide how to get seriously towork.  The second plan,  to which the best pre-cedents seemed to point, was a discussion upon aseries of resolutions raising the  main  questionsof principle as to  which  agreement  must  bereached before it is any use trying to construct anew constitution.   This,  also, looked too  like ablind alley.  It would pass the wit of man toframe the resolutions  without  raising  at onceissues upon which  we have in the past been inviolent  disagreement.    The-  path  of  wisdomseemed to be to explore  first the regions  wherewe know men have  been  trying to find commonground.   The procedure adopted  is that which,  aftergiving the matter the best thought of which I wascapable, I  recommended to  the Convention attheir  last Session.   On Tuesday next we com-mence  what for convenience we  may  call the&quot; Presentation  Stage.&quot;   In this,  all proposals  forthe future  government of  Ireland will be sub-mitted to the Convention in  such form and in suchorder as the Grand Committee,  through  whichthey  will have passed, direct. Each plan will bediscussed in turn, the purpose of the discussionbeing, not to arrive at any final decision as to itsadoption  or rejection,  but merely  to have  itthoroughly explained and to have it improved bysuch  amendment as its supporters may think wellto adopt in view of the arguments they have heard.It is  intended that the Presentation Stage shouldbe continued until the Convention feels that it hasbefore it all the proposals which have any likeli-hood of being adopted, either wholly or in part.This  method can only  succeed  if it  obtains tha                                      HLETTER FROM CHAIRMAN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CONVENTION.
general support of the Convention.   The purposein view is, as has been, I trust, made clear-above,-to enable the  different  sections of Irishmen inthe  Convention to know clearly,  as  they havenever  known  before,  what it  is in our  presentsystem of government that is complained of andexactly what  changes the different sections de-mand.  Further,  many of us who have indulgedpolitical hopes have had no expectation of theirearly realization.   Consequently, we have neverpresented them in sufficient  detail to enable afinal judgment to be come to upon their  merits.It is hoped  that the members of the Conventionwill do their best, by constructive criticism, to getevery proposal in turn presented in the best pos-sible form.  The  debate should be argumentativeand  conversational rather than  declamatory andimpassioned.  No man should hesitate to  expresshis views because he has difficulty at first  in find-ing the phraseology which is familiar  to few be-sides Members of Parliament  and lawyers.   Ispeak feelingly when I say that the utmost indulg-ence must be  extended to bad speakers.  At the meeting of the Grand Committee on the14tb instant, it was agreed that, after the Pre-sentation Stage, the Convention should be askedto decide upon the future procedure. It was sug-gested that it might  instruct  the Grand Com-mittee, or a Committee ad hoc, to draft a Billwhich, in view of  the opinions expressed upon thevarious proposals which  had been submitted forpreliminary  examination, might possibly form thebasis of an  agreed measure.   The draft wouldthen be re-submitted to the  Convention, where itwould go through the usual stages of a  Bill in the House of Commons.  It may be too much to hope-that complete agreement will be come to within the four corners of a single Bill, but I should be grievously disappointed if we did not find ourselves in  a position to announce to the world that we were not nearly so far apart in our political views and desires as had been formerly believed.   In concluding this letter already,  I fear,  too long I cannot refrain from adding a few sentences from the speech of  Sir Henry de Villiers on the 12th October,  1908,  before the  South  African National Convention, which had just unanimously elected him to preside over its deliberations:       &quot; The difficulties,&quot; he said, &quot; which we shall   have to encounter are great enough without our   going out of our way in order to add to them,   but I feel confident that they will not prove to   be insurmountable.   Everything depends upon   the  spirit with which we approach the perform-   ance of our task.  Failure is  certain if we start   with a feeling of distrust and suspicion of each   other and With the sole desire to secure as many   advantages  as  we  can  for our  respective   political  parties  or our  respective Colonies.   Success is certain if we give each  other our   fullest  confidence and act upon the principle   that, while  not neglectful of the  interests of   those  who have sent us here, we are,  for the   time being, representatives of the  whole of   British South Africa.&quot;   He  was an optimist crying in a wilderness of pessimists.   We know who was right and who was wrong.   I am,         My Lords and Gentlemen,                   Very faithfully yours,                      HORACE PLUNKETT.

By the Resolution passed at Cork on Septem-ber 25fch the  Convention referred  the variousschemes which had been submitted to and dis-cussed in  the Contention to  the  Grand  Com-mittee, in order  if possible to prepare a schemefor submission to the Convention,  which mightmeet the views and difficulties expressed by thedifferent  speakers  during  the  course&apos; of thedebate.  At  its  meeting&quot; on October 11th  the GrandCommittee  appointed  a Sub-Committee,  withinstructions  to sit  in  private to endeavour  tofind a basis  for. agreement,  and.to  report to theGrand Committee from time to. time..

Murphy; the Bishopof Raphoe; Mr.  Redmond,  and Mr. Russell.  It was further resolved  that the  Sub-Com-mittee appoint a Chairman from  time to  timeas they may think it necessary, and that shouldthey require  secretarial assistance they  shouldhave the services of  Sir Francis Hopwood.  The  Reports attached hereto are the Reportsmade by this Sub-Committee to the Grand Com-mittee of the Convention,  and taken into con-sideration by  the Grand Committee.INTERIM REPORT OF THE  SUB-COMMITTEE TO THE GRAND COMMITTEE OF THE IRISH  CONVENTION.  The  Sub-Committee appointed by the GrandCommittee at their  meeting on October 11th,with instructions  to  sit in private to endeavourto find a  basis for agreement, have the  honourto submit the following Interim Report:    We held our first meeting in Dubhn on October11th.    We  subsequently  met  in London  onOctober 24th  and  25th, and in Dublin on October30th and 31st, November 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 13th,14th and  15th.  Owing to his serious illness, which we  greatlyregret, we were deprived of the  services of SirAlexander  McDowell after  the   first  meeting.By the unanimous agreement of the  Sub-Com-mittee his place was taken by Mr.  Pollock,  andthis was  subsequently approved by the GrandCommittee.  We decided to  take the  heads of the schemesubmitted by the  Bishop of Raphoe  to the GrandCommittee on October 11th as the basis of ourdeliberations.  A  copy of this document is  at-tached (Schedule I.).  By November  7th  we had arrived  at certainprovisional conclusions upon  most  of  the headsof the scheme.   These conclusions are set outin  Schedule  II.,   which  also  indicates  thepoints which were reserved for further considera-tion.   At  this stage  it was considered desirablethat the Ulster representatives should communi-cate with their Advisory Committee with a viewto discovering how far the arrangement proposedwith regard to the composition of the two Housesof Parliament was  likely  to  prove acceptable.Having taken this course,  they  intimated to uson November loth that the Advisory Committeewere  unable to approve of the  suggestion  thatthe Ulster representation  in the Lower Houseshould be strengthened by the addition of a num-ber  of nominated  members. They  consideredthat the proposal to  include nominated membersto  represent  Southern Unionists could be  de-fended and might be accepted, but the same con-siderations did not apply in  the case of Ulster.The Ulster representatives undertook to submitproposals to  us for safeguarding the interests of Ulster by means other than  the extra represen-tation which we had  contemplated...  By this time, however;&apos;.it had become apparent that there was a sharp divergence  of opinion inthe Sub-Committee as to the  financial powersto be entrusted to the Irish Parliament.   Thescheme submitted by the Bishop of Raphoe contemplated  that,   pending  federation  of  theUnited Kingdom, there should be no Irish  repre-sentation in the Imperial Parliament,  and pro-vided  for  the exercise  by  the Irish Parlia-ment  of  complete  control  over  finance,  in-eluding Customs and Excise, and suggested theappointment  of  a Commission  to  negotiate  aTrade, Postal, and Customs  Union  betweenGreat  Britain and Ireland.   The Ulster  repre-sentatives demurred  to these proposals, and in-sisted  that full control over finance should beleft to the Imperial  Parliament.  Lord Southborough  submitted to us certainproposals  for effecting  a compromise by  givingto the Irish Parliament full control, subject toan  arrangement for  Free Trade between  GreatBritain and Ireland,  and special  provisions tomeet the case of  dumping.   A copy of theseproposals is attached Schedule III.  It was not found possible to  reach an  agree-ment  upon these lines,  and  we appeared  tohave  no  alternative but to report to the  GrandCommittee to that effect.  The Chairman  of theConvention  was,  however,  anxious  that  weshould not acquiesce in the failure to reach anagreement until there  had been a closer exami-nation of the arguments on  the one  side  andthe other.  He embodied  these views in a letterin which lie enclosed certain questions addressedto  the  Ulster and Nationalist representativesrespectively,  and also  a list of possible compro-mises.  Copies of this letter and of its enclosuresare attached Schedule IV.  ,   One set of replies was submitted jointly byMr.  Redmond, the  Bishop  of Raphoe,  Mr.Devlin, and  Mr.  Russell Schedule V.   A   separate reply  was  submitted  by  Mr.Murphy-Schedule VI.   These replies were communicated to the  Ulsterrepresentatives, and considered by them.  Theyfelt that in the circumstances the divergence  ofviews disclosed was so great that no useful pur-pose  would be served  by a formal  reply  to thequestions submitted to them,  and on November 14th they addressed to the Chairman of the Con-vention a letter containing  a  general statement
of their attitude on the financial problem.  Copiesof this letter were communicated at the sametime to all members  of the Sub-Committee.  Acopy is attached Schedule VII.   Lord Southborough also submitted to us pro-posals for a compromise,  which were a develop-ment of a suggestion previously made by LordMidleton that Customs should be reserved to theImperial Parliament, and that Excise should bespecially considered.   Under these proposals  (ofwhich  a  copy is attached Schedule VIII.) the-imposition of Customs Duties would remain withthe Imperial Parliament; the collection would becarried out under the authority of a Joint Board,and an Irish  contribution to Imperial Serviceswould be made a first charge against the Customsrevenue.   The  remaining  sources of revenuewould fie under the control  of the Irish Parlia-ment.   We are continuing our sittings, and have still&apos;to consider a proposal to be put forward by LordLondonderry.                       15th NOVEMBER, 1917.     SCHEDULE I.HEADS OF  THE  SCHEME.  1.

Ireland  to  have no share in  the miscellaneous revenue of the Imperial Government (Suez Canal Shares, etc.)  As from the passing of the Act or the transferof any  services,  the Irish  Government  shouldassume  liability  for  all loans that  have beenmade in  Ireland, and for  deposits  in  savingsbanks, etc.  The question  of  land purchase is dealt within the next section.  17.

Future  loans to be made on the credit of  theIrish Government,  or,  if  satisfactory arrange-ments can be made, on the credit of the ImperialGovernment.  An equitable  scheme of land  purchase thatwould be  compulsory on owner and tenant alike,where voluntary bargains  are not forthcomingafter a certain period, could be sanctioned.  The&quot;total provision  for  excess  stock  and bonus atpresent amounts to  800,000 a  year.  The subsidy from the tax payer for  pendingagreements will, owing to  changes in the priceof money, be at a much greater rate in pendingcases &quot;than it  was  in the cases  already com-pleted.  Another million, or more, may be needed .for  the unsold  areas.  The  whole  obligation  islargely  an Imperial one,  and Ireland  should getcredit for discharging it in  considering the ques-tion  of an  Imperial contribution.   18. JUDICIAL POWER.  The  following provisionsof the Government of Ireland Act to be adopted:     (a) Safeguai&apos;ding  position .of  existing  Irish           Judges  (sec. 32).

(c) Transferring appeals  from the House  of           Lords to  the  Judicial  Committee,           strengthened  bv  Irish  Judges (sec.           28).     (d) Extending right of appeal to this Court.           (Sec. 28  (4) and  Section  30 (1-2).     (e) Provision as  to reference  of questions           of validity to Judicial Committee (see           section  29).   19. LORD  LIEUTENANT.

DEFERRING  TAKING  OVER  CERTAIN IRISH) SERVICES.  Arrangements to  be  made to permit the Irish Government, if they so desire, to defer taking  over the services relating  to Land Pur- chase,  Old  Age Pensions, National  Insurance, Labour Exchanges, Post Office,  Trustee  Savings Banks, and Friendly Societies.                                  SCHEDULE  IT.A STATEMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL  CONCLUSIONS  AT  WHICH THE  SUB-               COMMITTEE HAD ARRIVED BY NOVEMBER 7TH.  (The Heads referred to below are those of thescheme  submitted. *   The  provisional under-standings  arrived at were all contingent on fullagreement on the general scheme being reached).                                         *See Schedule I.  HEAD 1.  The establishment of an Irish Par-liament is accepted as the basis of the  delibera-tions.
    HEAD 2.   The powers of the Irish Parliament  are to  be those set out in the scheme.    HEAD 3.   The restrictions  are accepted gener-  ally, subject to the following qualifications:       Sub-head  (3),  (a)  and  (b).     These were          deferred  for  further consideration.      Sub-head  (4)  is  reserved  for  consideration          in  connection with the general question          of finance, in so far as it gives to Ireland          the powers of a Dominion in regard to          Commercial Treaties.      Sub-head (6).  It is considered that &quot;control        &apos;  of harbours for naval and military pur-          poses&quot; should be substituted for &quot;con-    &apos;      trol of naval harbours.&quot; .    HEAD. 4.   Is. accepted.   With regard to sub- head 1,  the provision  for equal  treatment  of religious denominations  in  future must proceed from a  basis  of  equal  treatment  at  present. That is, the disabilities, etc.,  remaining under the Act of  1829 should be annulled.    HEAD 5.  It is agreed that  the question, of the power of the Irish Parliament to amend its Con- stitution  should  be considered by  a sub-coin- mi ttee.    Head 6.  Is  accepted, with the understanding that the Lord Lieutenant is to be a non-political personage.    HEAD  7.   Is accepted.    HEAD 8.  Is  accepted, subject to  a preference being expressed for  the  reservation of  Bills instead  of their postponement.    HEAD 9.  The title of  Senate  was preferred to that of  House  of  Lords.    The following modification  of the  proposals in the scheme  was provisionally approved:      CONSTITUTION OF SENATE.     Lord Chancellor       ...       ...    1     Archbishops   or   Bishops  of   the         Roman Catholic Church     ...    4     Archbishops   or   Bishops  of   the       Church of Ireland    ...       ...    2     Moderator  of  the  General Assembly  1    ,Lord Mayors of Dublin, Belfast and         Cork   ..........    3     Irish Peers    ...      ...       ...   15     Privy Councillors       ...       ...   15     Representatives of Commerce nomi-          nated by  Lord Lieutenant   ...   15-.....Labour   Representatives   (1  from          each province)     ...       ...    4       -                     Total     ...   60    It  was suggested that the Secretary  of the General Assembly might  be added.   In that event it was intimated  that  an addition to the number  of  Roman  Catholic  Bishops would  be expected.    It  was also  suggested that the Privy  Coun- cillors selected should be of two or three  years&apos; standing.    The sizeuf the &quot;Senate must be considered in relation to-  the -size  of  the  Lower  House,  and it was subsequently considered that  if the Lower House came down to  100 or ^L20  members it might be convenient to reduce the Senate to 40 members.   This would involve a reconsideration of the details of the  above scheme.   It was agreed that  the members of the Upper House should  be  nominated for,  say.  seven years.   HEAD 10.  CONSTITUTION OF HOUSE  OF COM- MONS.  It was  agreed that the Unionists should be offered,  by  effective means, a proportion of forty per cent,  in the  Lower House, and that in the Upper  House  of,  say,  forty,  thirty  should be men with a  substantial  stake in the  countrv. The exact method  of.  arriving  at this result was left for further  consideration,  but  it was agreed that  it could only  be obtained by  including a substantial  number of nominated  members.  It was  suggested  that,  in order to reduce to  a minimum  this  undemocratic   element   in the House, the size of the House  should be smaller than that proposed in the  scheme.   It was  stipulated that the nominated  element in the Lower House should continue for not less than ten  years.   Lord Midleton suggested  that,  on  the disap- pearance of this nominated element,  an  addition should  be  made to the numbers of the  Upper House.   This  was reserved  for  further con- sideration.   HEAD 11.  MONEY BILLS.  It was  agreed that the  Senate  should  have power to force a joint sitting of both  Houses over Money Bills.   HEAD  12.   DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN HOUSES. Agreed.  HEAD 13.  REPRESENTATION  AT  WESTMINSTER.The Unionist representatives intimated that thiswas a sine qua  non.   On the Nationalist side itwas stated that, while they did not favour thecontinuance  of  representation  in  the ImperialParliament,   pending Federation of the  UnitedKingdom, they  did  not look upon its cessationas a sine  qua non.  It was  agreed that  any  Irish representatives at Westminster  must have full power to deliber-ate and vote on all  questions.  The question  whether Irish representatives atWestminster should be directly elected  br dele-gated by the Irish  Parliament was reserved forfurther consideration.  It was suggested that thepresence of  a nominated element in the  IrishHouse of  Commons  would probably give  theUnionists  for a  time larger representation in adelegation  appointed  by that   House than bymembers  directly elected.  HEADS  14 AND  15.   FINANCE.   Reserved forfurther consideration.  The Nationalist representatives were preparedto  accept a  guarantee of Free Trade  between Great  Britain and Ireland, at any  rate for aterm of years.  The Unionists were of  opinionthat such a guarantee  was inconsistent with theIrish control of  Customs and  Excise.  HEAD 16.   IMPERIAL  CONTRIBUTION.  Reservedfor further consideration in connection with the question of  Finance.   HEAD  17.   LAND PURCHASE.   Reserved for consultation  with  the Sub-Committee  investi- gating this question.   HEAD. 18.  JUDICIAL POWERS.  Agreed,  condi- tionally  upon   the  Unionists  having  effective
representation in the Irish  Parhament.   It wasagreed that the Lord Chancellor  should  not  bea political officer, but that his salary as Speakerof the Senate should be placed on the Estimates.  HEAD 19.  LORD  LIEUTENANT.   It was  agreedthat the salary  of  the Lord Lieutenant  shouldbe sufficient to throw the post open to men notof great wealth.  It was arranged that enquiries should be madeas to the charges on the Lord Lieutenant&apos;s salaryat present.  It was agreed that the Lords Justices  shouldbe subject  to no religious disqualifications.  HEAD 20.   CIVIL SERVANTS.  .  It was  agreedthat a  strong Civil Service  Commission  shouldbe  established,  and  the following  compositionwas  suggested:    Lord  Chancellor,  Chairman;  two  permanentmembers appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, andholding office during  good behaviour.  The   practice  of  the English  Civil   ServiceCommission to be  followed as far as possible.  Competitive examinations  to  regulate admis-sion to.the  Service as far as possible.  The   Unionist  members   having  expressedanxiety as to the exercise of patronage in Ulster,it  was suggested  that  two additional membersmight  be added to  the Commission to protecttheir interests.  It was agreed  that  the present  exercise ofpatronage by the Lord  Chancellor would requireto be reviewed,  and that there should, in future,be  no  unpaid Magistrates.  A clause should be inserted requiring the CivilService Commissioners  to prepare a scheme forfuture, appointments to  the Public Service, suchscheme to be laid before both Houses before anysuch appointments are  made.  It  might  be aninstruction  to  the  Commissioners,   in  framingsuch a scheme,  to devise a scale appropriate tothe financial and other  circumstances of Ireland.  HEAD 21.  RESERVED SERVICES.  Reserved forfurther consideration.          SCHEDULE  III.PROPOSALS  FOR  A  COMPROMISE.          CUSTOMS AND EXCISE.  The attached draft is an attempt to reconcilethree  propositions which  may  appear to  bealmost irreconcilable.   These propositions are:     1. That Ireland should have complete fiscal           autonomy.    2. That there should be Free Trade between           Great Britain and Ireland.    8. That Ireland should have ^power to pro-           tect her industries from unfair corn-           petition by British Industries.  The draft is only a tentative suggestion, andshould the principles  underlying  it  meet  withany  degree of acceptance,  it would require  tobe revised  by  experts both in Customs  Adminis-tration and in the drafting of Bills.  1.  The Irish Parliament shall, subject to  theprovisions of this Act, have full power to imposecustoms  duties on all  articles  imported  intoIreland from outside.  2.  (1) The  Irish  Parhament  shall not impose          customs duties on articles the produce,           growth   or   manufacture  of  Great           Britain,  and  the  British Parliament           shall not impose  customs duties  on           articles the produce, growth or manu-          facture  of Ireland, save as hereinafter          provided.     (2) If  the Irish Parliament imposes excise          duties on any articles  of Irish  pro-          duce, growth  or manufacture, it may          also  impose equivalent customs duties          on  such articles  of  British  produce,          growth  or  manufacture;  and if the          British   Parliament  imposes  excise          duties on any articles of British pro-          duce, growth or manufacture, it may          also  impose equivalent customs duties          on  such articles  of  Irish   produce,          growth&apos;  or manufacture.    (3) There  shall be  established a Board  to         be  called the Joint  Customs Board,         consisting of  two members appointed         by the  Treasury,  and two. members      appointed by the Irish  Treasury, and      a Chairman appointed by His Majesty. (4) If the Irish  Government be of opinion      that the producers, growers or rnanu-      facturers of any article  in Ireland are      being subjected to unfair competition      through the importation into Ireland      from  Great Britain  of  articles which      by  reason of  State aid,  industrial      combination or other cause are being      sold at a price less than  the actual      cost of manufacture, distribution and      sale with  the  addition of a fair com-      mercial profit;  or if  the British Gov-      ernment   .....  (etc., etc.,      mutatis  mutandis);   then  the  Irish      Government or the  British  Govern-      ment,  as  the .case  may  be, may      require the Joint  Customs  Board to      investigate the matter. (5) The Joint Customs Board, on  being so      required, shall  investigate the matter      with  all  convenient dispatch,  and      shall  report  to  both  Governments      whether in fact such  unfair  compe-      tition  exists, and if  so,  what rate or      rates of customs duty or duties would      be sufficient to counteract  it. (6) On the issue of  such a report, it shall      be lawful for  the  Irish  or  British      Parhament, as  the case may be, to      impose customs duties  on  the said      articles of  British or  Irish  growth,      produce or manufacture  to the extent      found by the Joint Customs Board to      be sufficient to  counteract the unfair      competition.(7) Any customs duties imposed in accord-      ance with  the  provisions of the fore-      going paragraph shall be immediately      discontinued if  the  Joint  Customs      Board shall  report  that the unfair      competition which gave  rise to their      imposition  has  ceased.
MY LORDS; AND GENTLEMEN;    At  yesterday&apos;s ,meeting of your  Sub-Com-mittee a deadlock appeared to have been reachedupon  the chief practical issue the Conventionhas to decide  before it  can frame a  system ofself-government for Ireland,  It was pointed out,on the one hand, that,  in  the present  state ofNationalist opinion in Ireland, it  would be use-less to  propose any such restriction  upon  thetaxing powers  of an Irish  Parliament  as  thereservation of Customs and Excise to the BritishParliament.   On  the other  hand, the UlsterUnionist members of the Sub-Committee statedthat,  even if they were-in agreement with theNationalist majority,  those  whom they repre-sented would not listen for a moment  to  anyproposal  which would enable  the Irish Parlia-ment  to  set up a tariff wall between Ireland andGreat Britain.   On  both sides, it  seemed to befelt that further negotiation upon  this  vital, issue(between fiscal autonomy and fiscal union) wouldbe a  mere waste  of time,  and that the GrandCommittee should be so informed.  At  this  point I  appealed  to   the  Sub-Com-mittee to postpone a final conclusion until I hadhad an opportunity of putting to them in writingcertain  questions, the answers to which wouldat any rate show that the matter  in dispute hadbeen  fully debated  and  that  the  opposite con-clusions  had been dictated by  a genuine wish topromote the best interests  of  the  country.  In  taking  this  course, I  had  two  objects inview-first,  I wished the question to be  threshedout in  its purely  business  aspects,  as it  wasimpossible to avoid the  impression- that its dis-cussion  had been largely  influenced by senti-ment.   It  is  idle  to ignore  the fact  that, tothe great majority  of Irish  Nationalists,  fiscalautonomy, advocated as a  means of  industrialdevelopment at home and of commercial expan-sion abroad,  appeals, perhaps even more  strongly,as  a  symbol  of political  autonomy.    UlsterUnionists know  this; and,  while they  are, nodoubt,   convinced  that,  for  purely  practicalreasons, any  disturbance of  the  present  fiscalarrangements would be  undesirable, they upholdfiscal union  as something more than a symbol ofpolitical union.   Again, while the Nationalistsbelieve that  Great Britain&apos;s fiscal  policy is neces- sarily  governed by British  rather   than  IriSh interests, Ulster Unionists fear that an Irish fiscal policy would, in the present state of public opinion down South, be actuated by anti-British motives. And  even if,  after  the  settlement of the Irish Question,  such matters  were  sure to be consid- ered  on their merits, the business men  of Ulster fear  that, with the  best wishes in the world,  a parliament predominantly  agricultural would  be incapable  of  understanding the  problems  of  a highly industrialised community.   As long   as  the  practical  business  questions before us are debated  wuth these mental  reser- vations, we are dealing wdth  false issues.   I do not,   for  a  moment,  underrate the  practical importance  of  the  sentimental considerations involved.   They must weigh  on  both sides; but they  can and should be distinguished  from the business considerations : so  that  the latter  can be  discussed  upon  their merits.   To this  end we must also assume and I  am sure our Ulster friends will  agree  to   assume   that,  in  its                 IRISH CONVENTION,             DUBLIN, 6th November, 1917.economic  policy, the Irish Parliament  will beguided  by  common sense.   The questions 1submit  herewith  are based on this assumption.  My second purpose in thus addressing you isto call  your attention  to  the critical  stage  atwhich we have arrived in the  proceedings of theConvention, and  to  tell you frankly what I,  asChairman, consider its  proper course in  the dis-eharge of its  awful  responsibility.  . It  is quitetrue that  if, after the further consideration I amabout to  ask has been  given  to  the  main issuein dispute,  no compromise seems possible, wemay abandon all hope  of  an agreed settlementfor a united Ireland.   But if,  unhappily, anygroup in the Convention is unable to reach agree-ment on  certain vital  issues, the  responsibilityof framing a constitution for Ireland will rest onthe  main body.  Its deliberations should lead,at any  rate, to  one good result namely,  thatthe  issues of the controversy will be narrowedand  defined.  While we should not have settledthe  Irish  Question,  we  should have made it farmore amenable  to settlement than we&quot; found it.   I  devoutly  hope that some compromise  mayyet  be found upon the  crux which has so nearlybrought us  to a  deadlock.  What I plead for atthe  moment is that  we should go steadily aheadwith our work  of  exploring  the Irish  politicalproblem in all its aspects. Then, if we cannotcome to  a complete agreement,  as many of usas possible  must endeavour to submit proposalsfor a broad and equitable settlement of the  IrishQuestion .to&quot;the  judgment of our  countrymen andof the.  world.

QUESTIONS FOR  ULSTER REPRESENTATIVES.  1. Are you afraid that an  Irish Parliamentmight  impose  taxes on  the  raw  material  ormachinery  of your industries?  If so, would your fear  be met by a provisionthat there should be free trade between Englandand Ireland  (i.e.,  that neither country  shouldimpose customs duties on goods produced in  theother  without imposing an equivalent  excise)?  Alternatively, would you  be  satisfied  by aprohibition of import duties in Ireland on specificrawr materials or machinery?  2. Are you afraid of your exports being exposedto customs duties in England if England becameprotectionist?  Would this objection be met by  provisions forfree trade between the two countries  as above?  3. Are you, -generally speaking, afraid of fric-tion between Ireland  and England, leading totariff  wars?  Would the above safeguard satisfy you?  4. Are you afraid that lreland&apos;s tariff arrange-ments with foreign countries might cause frictionbetween Ireland and England?  &apos; /&quot;.-&quot;                         *                                      SCHEDULE  IV.LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN TO  THE MEMBERS OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF NINE.
  Would not the duties  upon foreign goods  im-ported into  England  from Ireland obviate thisdanger ?  5. Are you afraid that Ulster industries mightbe  unfairly  taxed, by income tax or otherwise,in order  to  provide bounties  for southern indus-trids?   -     .               T  Would  you- be satisfied  by  a limitation of-permissible  expenditure  on bounties or a limi-tation  of industries  on  which bounties can  begiven,  or of both?  0. Do  you  fear that  an  Irish  Governmentrepresenting agricultural  interests  would  notadequately appreciate industrial and commercialproblems?  &apos;  If so,  how  far would  your fears be met byParliamentary safeguards in the form  of a Pro-yinciai veto on legislation or a strong non-electedUpper House,  or special representation in  theLower House?  QUESTIONS FOR NATIONALIST REPRESENTATIVES.  1. Are you afraid that unless Ireland has fiscalautonomy&apos; the Irish Government will not be  ableto,  adjust  its  controllable  tax-revenue to  itsexpenditure? - Would it satisfy  you  if Ireland  bad control(a) - over direct  taxation  only  or  (b)  over bothdirect and indirect taxation  subject to the limi-tation as  to  free  trade with  England,  or  (c)over  Excise but not  Customs, or (d) over therates of Customs duties  but not over  the selec-tion of  the articles subjected to them?   2. Are- you  afraid  that   if  under  a fiscalunion,  England  became -protectionist,  some ofthe duties  imposed  might injure Irish interests (eg.,  a  duty  on steel)?.   Would you  be satisfied if  fiscal union  only went so far as  to secure mutual free  trade?    3. Are  you  afraid that  if, under  complete fiscal  union,  England became  protectionist andbecame  involved  in tariff wars with  foreigncountries, Irish industries might suffer?  Would the same remedy meet this fear  (Ire-land being able to  make  her own terms  withforeign  countries)?  4. Are you afraid that under fiscal union Ire-land would  be unable to encourage new indus-tries or  protect industries  from &quot;dumping&quot;?  Would  this  fear be  met by power  to  grantbounties and to impose special duties  on  goodsproved  to  be  &quot; dumped &quot;?    POSSIBLE  ARRANGEMENTS FOR  COMPROMISE.  1. Ireland  to have control  over  direct  taxes.England  to  impose  indirect  taxes,  and  retaintheir proceeds.  2. Ditto, but Ireland to receive  the  proceeds.  8. Ditto,  but Ireland  to  receive  a specifiedpart of the proceeds.  4. Any of the above, plus the power to Ire-land to giant  bounties.  5. Any of the above, plus the power to.Ire-land to protect industries against dumping:  6. Ireland to have control over Excise, notover Customs.  7. Ireland to have the right to vary the ratesof  the Customs duties,  but not  to  select thearticles  subjected  to them.  8. Ireland to have  control over Excise aridCustoms subject to free trade between Englandand Ireland  except to  excisable articles.  9. Any of the  above arrangements  combinedwith Parliamentary  safeguards  to ensure  thatminorities may have an adequate  force in fiscalpolicy, eg., a provincial veto,  strong un-elected Upper House, special representation  in  Lower House.SCHEDULE V.ANSWERS.  TO  THE   QUESTIONS  ADDRESSED  TO  NATIONALIST                         .   REPRESENTATIVES.                              EXPLANATORY  NOTE.  The  answers  to  the questions addressed  toNationalist Representatives  were discussed byfour members of the  Sub-Committee,  and therewas general  agreement with regard  to  the re-plies,    t  It was suggested  that  as an addendum  tothese answers containing the general Nationalistview  about Customs, - Excise;  and  Taxation,  asummary should be  given of the various pro-posals made to  safeguard  Ulster Unionists andtrade interests which might  be imperilled by  anunwise  use of the powers  claimed.  The- member who added  this summary had notan  opportunity of showing what he had  writtento  his colleagues, and it has since been  pointedout to  him that the  expression &quot; equality  ofvoting power  between  Unionists and National-ists&quot;  (page 67, col. 2, lines 21-2) did not preciselyindicate the character of the suggestion made, asit  was realised  in  discussion  that it would  beimpossible to secure a definite political characterto members of the Senate, but it was believed tobe possible to guarantee in the proportions indi-cated the presence  of substantial men with  astake in  the country  who would safeguard theinterests for which the minority in Ireland wereconcerned.  It is  necessary, therefore, to  statethat the closing  paragraphs relating to safeguardswere  only a summary, and must be taken withthe limitations  and  extensions  suggested in thediscussion at  the sub-committee,  of which  nodoubt all the members have full notes.  QUESTION (1). Yes, we consider it essential thatIreland should be able to finance the whole of hergovernment  out of  taxes  imposed and  collectedby her own Parliament.  Dual control over Irishtaxation  would  prevent  the  fulfilment of thiscondition.  It would, therefore, hamper efficientand  economic  government in Ireland, besidesgiving  opportunities for dangerous  friction  be-tween two taxing authorities, Imperial and Irish.  Our  answers to the four questions put to  usunder this head  are  as follows:   To (a)  the answer is No.   For the  follow-ing reasons; Direct taxes (less excess profits,     1    &apos;  &apos;                            I
which will  cease in peace)  now  bring in lessthan  7i  millions, a  sum not  nearly  sufficient tocover the cost of Irish government, amountingto  over  12i  millions.    Customs  and Exciseduties now yield eleven millions.    Even sup-posing that the  proceeds of these  duties werecredited  to Ireland,  though their imposition andcollection remained  in  Imperial hands, between65  and 70 per cent, of Irish tax-revenue wouldbe  subject to outside control, while power overthe remainder would be  gravely  curtailed,  be-cause  even the  direct  taxes would  have  to  bevaried to conform to changes in direct taxationimposed  from without.   An  Imperial generaltariff, for example, might raise the yield of Cus-toms  and Excise, while a British Labour Minis-try, raising money mainly by the high taxationof  incomes,  and  lowering  indirect   taxation,might compel Ireland automatically  to  raise  herincome-tax.  If on the other hand the proceeds of Customsand Excise were paid  direct  into the  ImperialTreasury the  position would be worse.  A con-siderable part of these  proceeds would have tobe  paid  back as  a  subsidy  to Ireland  in  orderto  meet the  cost   of Irish   Government,  thebalance  &apos; presumably being  retained by  GreatBritain  as  a  contribution by Ireland towardsImperial expenditure.   We regard  a system ofsubsidies, whatever  form it might take,  as  a badfinancial device  which would sap responsibilityand gravely fetter Ireland&apos;s power to direct  herown legislative and  financial policy.  Moreover,the amounts available for subsidy and contribu-tidn would  necessarily vary  as  indicated  aboveaccording to British fiscal and social policy  forthe time being.  It might  be proposed (somewhat on  the linesof the Act of 1914)  to  reserve certain Irish ser-vices  for Imperial control, end to finance  theseservices  out of the proceeds of Imperial  Customsand Excise  duties levied in Ireland.   We regardsuch  a  course as altogether  indefensible.  Be-sides  still further  complicating financial rela-tions,  it would take away from Ireland the re-sponsibility for part of its  own government.  Lastly, apart from the effect on  the revenueand expenditure  of  Ireland,  the reservation  tothe Imperial Government of Customs and Excisewould remove  trade and social policy, so far  asthey  can be influenced  by these duties, whollyfrom  the control of  the Irish Parliament.   Wecould not agree  to  such a drastic restriction  ofwhat   we   consider  an  indispensable  power,though in the interests of compromise we mightagree  to some  Reasonable  concession.    (Seejunder (b) ).  To  (b) the answer is that a compromise mightbe  possible  on the lines suggested.  That is, anarrangement might  be  made  for Free Trade  be-tween Ireland and  Great  Britain in goods  ofhome produce or manufacture, with the excep-tion  in  regard  to  articles  subject  to  Excise.There should also (see  under question 3)  be aprovision to guard against unfair competition  ordumping.  The  arrangement  should be termi-nable  and  renewable after a fixed period, andshould be subject  to  earlier  revision  if GreatBritain changed  her trade policy.  To  (c) the  answer is No.   Control over Ex-cise would involve alterations in Customs Regu-lations. if exercised  freely, and a power of con-troi over Excise hampered  by the  restriction that it would  involve no interference with Cus- tonis would mean  that there  wras no real con- trol even over Excise, and would be of little or no use.   To  (d)  the  answer  is  No.  An  Irish  Par- liament would desire to have the power to select the  articles which  it  proposed to  make duti- able, subject,  of  course, to the restrictions  im- plied in the answer to question (b)  should  the arrangement there  suggested be agreed to.   QUESTION (2).   Yes.   Our fear is  that Great Britain  would   consult   her   own  economic interests, which are overwhelmingly greater than ours, and that Irish interests would be neglected. This fear  is  justified  by past  history.   Duties might be imposed oh  raw materials like steel, which can  be produced in Great Britain, &quot;but not id Ireland, and of Which Ireland is a user, not a manufacturer.    This would hamper all industries  using  steel  in  Ireland.    Or,  again, the agricultural interests might be sacrificed to the industrial  interests in  Great  Britain.  Pro- tests by labour against any  taxation of  food  protests likely to  become louder after the war  might lead to a  policy accepted by the  Tariff Reformers a few  years ago, which was to admit food free,  and to place duties  oh manufactured articles.    That  would  tell against  Irish  in- terests,  the riiost important of  which is agrifcul- ture, as we should be buying in a protected mar - ket, where  prices would be artificially sustained, and selling in a  market where there was free competition.   With  regard to the  second part of the ques- tion, the answer, as indicated before,  is  that agreement  is possible  on  these  lines with  the limitations  and provisoes suggested.   QUESTION  (3).   Yes.   It  is  quite  possible that tariff wars with foreign countries might under a fiscal urtion result in the  denjal to us of neces- sary raw materials, or, more probably, in high tariffs against Irish  linens,  cottons, liquors, fish, or other articles.   To the second part of the question the answer is &quot; yes,&quot; if Ireland were able to make her own terms with foreign  countries the  danger  would be greatly lessened.   QUESTION  (4).  Yes, if  we   had  control  of Excise   we  could remove  restrictions on  the manufacture of industrial alcohol, for example, an  industry capable  of great   development  in Ireland,  or  we could  encourage the  production of Irish  tobacco, or, perhaps, sugar-beet.   As it is necessary for us to become more self-support- ing  in  the  matter  of  food,  and, therefore, to cultivate a  much  larger area, it beeohies  of im- portance to the agricultural interests to provide that all  the crops in rotation  shall be profitable. It would be intolerable if the Irish Government were unable to riiake Excise regulations  facili- tating the  manufacture of industrial  alcohol. This is simply by way of  illustration.    Under the  present system new Irish  industries, eventhose which might be  deemed proper to Ireland because  of our production of raw materials such as hides, wool,  etc., suffer  severely in competi- tion with long-established  leather, boot,   shoe, or  woollen  industries  in Great Britain,  which have no natural  advantages  over Irish  indus- tries,,but the artificial, advantage  of  priority in establishment  and  large capital  reserves,  en- abling them to undersell for a while at a loss to themselves in order  to  knock out Irish rivalry.
  The fear would be met to some extent by thepower  inherent in  any  Government  to grantbounties to industry,  and by the added power(see answer to question 1 (b) ) to impose specialduties  on  goods which  proved  to  be  dumped,though we feel bound to point out the difficultyof franiing provisions  to ensure  the proper ful-iilrnent  of  the latter object.   We wish to add  the  following supplementary remarks: -   We regard Ireland  as a Nation,  an economic entity.    Governments  exist to foster  the eco- upmic  interests  of  their peoples.   Self-govern- ment does not exist where  those nominally en- trusted with affairs  of government have not con- trol of  fiscal and economic policy.  No Nation with self-respect  could accept ,the idea that while its citizens were  regarded as capable of creating wealth  they were regarded  as  incompetent  toregulate the  manner in which  taxation  of that wealth  should be arranged, and that  another country should have  the power of levying and collecting taxes,  the taxed country  being placed in. the position of a  person of infirm mind whose affairs  are regulated by trustees.    No  finality could he looked f or in such an arrangement, not even a  temporary satisfaction.  It is also, in  our opinion, wrong to  contem-plate continuing these methods of taxation for a poor country as for  a rich.  It  is just as wrong as  it would  be ,to have the  same five  shillings incqnie-,tax on ,the  income  of  the  labourer as on  the income  of  the  millionaire.   In Great Britain the average  wealth per head is so much greater  than in  Ireland  that indirect  taxation, which can be borne  easily even  by the labouring classes, inflicts  the greatest hardships  on the same classes in Ireland.  We  also wish  to  point out that  without an Irish collection of taxes,  including Custom Houseinspection of  all imported goods,  it would be im- possible for  us to discover  what was the  true Irish revenue.  It has been admitted that the figures  attributed to Ireland in  the past in re- spect of income-tax  and on dutiable articles liketea are largely based  on guess work.  Without accurate knowledge of our true tax revenue  there would always be suspicions on  the  part of Ire- land that it was  mulcted in sums which  did not appear  in the Treasury Papers.-  Lastly, it  may be said that without an  Irish control  over Customs and Excise, and the power held in reserve of regulating trade  policy with Great Britain,  Ireland would have  no real bar- gaining power in case of Great Britain adopting a  protective ,pqlic3r.   Irish representation at Westminster would  give less bargaining  power than the right in the hands of an Irish&quot; Govern - ment to continue a  policy of free imports, if it so  desired, in respect of  the raw materials  re- quired for industry in Ireland, or, on the  other hand,  to  protect  its business interests  against for eign  trade combinations.  It is desirable that such powers  should be as little used as possible,but they should  be  held in  reserve.  It  would, be the worst  possible business policy, as it would the worst possible military policy, never to con- template change, advance or retreat, and to pre- pare for,no eventualities.   We  say  this  just asmuch in the  interest of Ulster as in the interest of the Southern farmers.   We agree  that  as few  obstacles as  possible should be placed between Ireland and its greatest customer.  Irish farmers,  even more than Ulster industrialists,  are  concerned  about free trade, for their products  are perishable by nature, and lessen rapidly in value by delay at ports.  It is much  easier  to   imagine  Ulster  industrialists changing their views in this respect than Irish farmers,  and the natural  interests of  Irish pro- ducers are the best protection  against unwise changes  in trade  policy.   We  realise  that  the industries of  Ulster  are so  important  that safe- guards, in addition to those already suggested, may  reasonably be demanded.  The main safe- guard proposed is  to  give Ulster - and  other Unionists political  power equal  to their economic interests.     Special  representation  in  both Houses  of  Parliament would be  agreed to,  so that  in case  of dispute over questions affecting Ulster &quot;or Unionist interests both Houses would sit together and an equality of voting power be- tween Unionists and Nationalists, so far as such a thing  can be arranged,  in theory, would take place.    This,  it  is  urged, would  give ample security that  no policy would be adopted which was not in harmony with the interest of Ulster industry.   Li  conclusion, we  desire to draw attention to some  other  ways  of  meeting  the  fears   of Unionists, fears we  most  earnestly  desire  to allay by  any  means  which  do  not conflict with the fundamental  principles which we  consider it necessary  to maintain.   (1). The  inconvenience  dreaded  from  Irish fiscal autonomy might be  obviated by  means of a small Commission  composed in equal numbers of members nominated by the British  and Irish Parliaments, with  an independent Chairman,  to arrange a trade, postal, and customs  union,  or agreement between  Great  Britain  and Ireland, subject to  the approval  of both  Parliaments, and with the  provision that, in the event of dis- agreement in  the  Commission,  or  disapprovalby either Parliament, the  most-favoured-nation terms allowed in the matter on either side to a foreign or colonial  government  should be put in force  by  Boyal Proclamation.    On any Corn- mission  of this kind special representation  for the North-East could be secured.   (2). It  might be  possible to arrange for  an Irish   Parliamentary  Committee  to  which  all questions relating  to changes  in  Customs  and Excise should be referred, and in which a pre- ponderating influence could be  given  to repre- sentatives of  the  great  industrial interests  in Ulster.  As  an alternative to all other suggestions for compromise put forward in this Memorandum, a veto exercised by an Ulster Grand Committee on matters affecting  the special interests of theprovince  might in the last resort be considered. We regard this as the  least desirable  form  of compromise,  and would prefer that Ulster would accept the larger representation in both  Houses of  Parliament  as  the  right method  of safe-guarding  their interests.  By this method Irishinterests would be  considered all together, as  ismost  desirable. The friction at  present unfor-tunately existing between  Ulster and  the restof Ireland would not be  perpetuated.   A  vetowould also prevent practical and constitutionaldifficulties of  a grave nature, and if other pro-vinces demand the  same power,&apos;Irish legislationand administration  would be involved- in a tangleof Complexities.

                                       SCHEDULE VI.REPLIES BY ME.  W. M.  MURPHY TO QUESTIONS FOR NATIONALIST REPRESENTA-        TIVES SUBMITTED BY  SIR HORACE PLUNKET, 6TH NOVEMBER, 1917.  QUESTION.  (1).  Are you  afraid  that  unless  Ireland  hasfiscal autonomy the Irish Government will  notbe able to adjust its controllable tax-revenue toits expenditure ?  Would  it satisfy  you if  Ireland  had control(a)  over direct  taxation  only  or  (b) over bothdirect  and indirect  taxation subject  to the limi-tation  as to free trade  with  England, or  (c) overExcise  but not  Customs, or  (d) over the ratesof Customs duties but  not over the selection ofthe articles subjected to  them?  ANSWER.  (1). In  order to  answer this question intelli-gently  it would be necessary to be sure  what ismeant by &quot;Controllable Tax Revenue.&quot;   I takeit from the context that  it means partial fiscalautonomy as distinct from full fiscal autonomy,and on that assumption it appears to me that itwould  be  impossible to adjust Revenue to Ex-penditure if one set of Taxes were voted by anIrish Parliament and  another set by a BritishParliament.  Moreover, it would leave, the IrishParliament only partially responsible for raisingthe Taxes  which the Irish Government was ex-pending, and it would  take away from them theincentive  to economy  in  almost as  great  a  de-gree as if the whole  of  the Irish  Taxes werelevied  by  the  British  Parliament and  handedover to be expended by  an Irish Government.  In answer to the second part of this question,no fiscal system would  satisfy  me that does  notgive an Irish Parliament plenary powers  over allIrish Taxes, including  Customs and  Excise, andalb other sources of Irish Revenue.  QUESTION.  (2). Are you  afraid  that  if, under a  fiscalunion,  England became protectionist some of theduties  imposed might injure Irish interests  (eg.,a duty  on steel)?  Would  you  be satisfied , if fiscal  union onlywent as far as to secure mutual free trade?    - r                                        *  ANSWER.  (2). I an? quite  sure  that  if England  becameProtectionist no regard would be had to  Irishinterests where  they  did not  harmonise  withBritish  interests, and  I do  not look upon anyrepresentation  that Ireland could  claim  in  aHouse of more than seven hundred  members atWestminster as any protection in this respect.No British Budget was ever  directly affected byanything that could be done by Irish Members.  With regard to the  second paragraph of thisquestion,  I would be willing to consider a  Coin-mercial Treaty between Great Britain  and Ire-land, under Home Rule with full fiscal authority,for  the  free  interchange  of the produce audmanufactures of  both  countries, with provisionagainst dumping, though  I would  prefer  thatthis Treaty should be  arranged between the twoParliaments after the Irish Parliament was estab-lished.  QUESTION.  (8).  Are you afraid that  if,  under  completefiscal union,  England  became  protectionist andbecame   involved  in  tariff  wars&apos; with foreigncountries, Irish industries might suffer?  Would the same, remedy meet this fear (Ire-land  being able  to  make  hei*  own  terms withforeign countries) ?  ANSWER.  (3).  Yes.   For  reply to  the  second  part ofquestion  see  reply to second part of  Question 2.  QUESTION.  (4).  Are you afraid that  under fiscal  unionIreland would be unable to encourage  new in-dustries or protect industries from &quot;dumping&quot;?  Would  this fear be met by  power to.&quot;grantbounties  and to impose  special  duties on goodsproved to be &quot; dumped &quot;?  Answer.  (4). Without fiscal freedom  I  feel sure thatIreland could do  little or nothing to encouragenew  industries or  to  protect industries  from&quot; dumping.&quot;  My fears  on this head would bemet in a large degree by power to grant bountiesand to impose special duties on goods proved tobe  &quot; dumped &quot; which  would be incidental to  ameasure  of full fiscal autonomv.SCHEDULE VII.Dear- Sir  Horace,  In reply to the communication which you haveaddressed to  us we  must  point  out that  thedifference which has brought the proceedings ofthe  Sub-Committee &quot; nearly  to  a  deadlock &quot;rests  on points  of  principle and not of  detail.  We hold that in matters of fiscal policy andeconomic  life the  interests  of Ireland  are in-separable  from those of Great  Britain, and  thatthere can. be  no Customs barrier or differentiation  Of  taxation  between  the two countries,which are,  and must continue to  be, so  inti-mately associated.  You  submit  the following view &quot; in   thepresent state  of Nationalist opinion  it would  beuseless  to propose  any such  restriction on  thetaxing powers of   an  Irish  Parliament as  the14(/i November,  1917.reservation  of  Customs   and - Excise &apos; to  theBritish  Parliament.&quot;  To  set  out  our apprehensions of the use towhich powers of control of cither  direct or in-direct  taxation might  be  put by an Irish  Ear-liament would be an ungrateful task  which wedo not propose to undertake.  It has been madeclear  to us, however, that one  object  would beattained by  their acquisition,  and that is toescape from all liability for National  Debt  andfrom bearing any share in the  cost of the war orof national defence  in the  future  beyond  suchvoluntary  contribution as  an Irish Parliamentshould from time to time  think fit to make.  You say rightly that  &quot; to the great majority ofthe Nationalists  fiscal  autonomy,  advocated as
354a rneans of.industrial.development at home, andof  economic  expansion abroad, . appeals; evenmore   strongly   as  a  symbol   of  politicalautonomy.&apos;&apos; -To  go further and  say: that  theadoption of.this doctrine of Irish fiscal autonomywill-, , under.. a Colonial form oi: government-,separate  all..our  interests from  Great. Britainmustt inevitably lead to the  same  goal  as. theSinn. Fejners desire to  reach under  a republic.  The  demand is, in fact,  that Ireland shall beseparated  absolutely from  Great Britain and,except for the  sovereignty&apos;of the King,  occupythe &quot;position  of  ah&apos; independent  nation.   Thismeansthat Ireland, desirous  of increasing  herindustrial  activities and with&quot; practically no rawmaterials within herself, will be cut  adrift fromthe&apos; strongest commercial  power  in the worldand have to rely  upon her own resources in  thewelter of economic  trouble  with which the W&quot;orldwill be surrounded  at the conclusion  of the war.  You&apos;will thus realise that the question does  notdepend on. small accommodations  such  as&apos; areput forward&apos;;&apos; the  question is  far wider; more  im-portant, and, indeed, vital.  We are satisfied that  for  Ireland and for GreatBritain a  common  system of Finance with  oneExchequer is a fundamental essential,  and thatIrish  industrial  and. commercial interests andthe development, of our..resources can  be.bestfurthered.in full  community with the economiclife of the great industrial people with whom w7ehave so  much in  common  and. from Whom werefuse to be divorced.  You  express the hope that some compromisemay yet be found,..and that wre should go onwith the work.of  &quot;exploring the Irish;politicalproblem  in all its aspects.&quot;  We consider thatto do so  without  making  a clear  statement ofwhat  we regard  as  a  fundamental  conditionwould  be to  leave us open to  the reproach ofcarrying on the business of the Convention under-false pretences.   Having stated  our position onthis matter we are willing  to give considerationto any further schemes that may be put beforeus.                 Yours faithfully,      (Signed)    HUGH  T. BABBIE,                   i           . Chairman  Ulster Representatives,      (Signed)     LONDONDERRY,                             Hon. Secretary.SCHEDULE VIII.PROPOSALS FOR  A  COMPROMISE.                CUSTOMS.  1. It is  essential  that the Irish  Governmentshould have under its control sources of revenuesufficient to cover the cost of the services whichit administers.  2. It should, therefore,- be recognised that, inprinciple,  all  heads  of Irish revenue  should besubject to such control.  3. At the same time  it should be recognisedthat a contribution from Ireland to the  cost ofImperial Services is called for,  not  primarily inthe interests  of Great Britain,  but because re-luctance to accept an obligation of honour wouldbe derogatory to  the dignity and self-respect ofIreland.  4. Any ,such contribution  ought to  be placedon a definite  basis which would remove it fromthe sphere of Parliamentary controversy.  5. The easiest way to  achieve this is to makeit a definite charge against, a particular head ofrii venue.  0. It  is suggested  that  the  most  convenienthead is the Customs.  7. The desirability  of maintaining Free  Tradebetween Great Britain and Ireland for a term ofyears   being  admitted,  and  Imperial  Servicesbeing  made a  first charge on the Customs reve-nue by the  arrangement above  suggested, it isonly a small  concession  to leave the impositionof Customs  Duties to the British Governmentfor  the duration of  the proposed Free Tradearrangement.  8. The fact that this  compromise wrould  re-lieve the anxiety felt by  Ulster is a strong argu-ment In its favour.  9. The increasing prospect of a federalisationof the  British Isles  is an  additional argument, for should this prospect lie realised it is certain that Customs must be an item of Federal Reve- nue.   10. The imposition of Customs Duties should be left to the Imperial Parliament; the collection should be made  under the authority of a Joint Board on which Ireland should have equal repre- sentation with Great Britain,  and the determi- nation of the share of Customs Revenue attri- butable  to  Ireland should also  rest  with this Board.   11. The whole of this share  should be  carried to the credit of Ireland, and the &quot;  contribution to Imperial purposes &apos;&apos; (winch should be  speci- fied  in  the Constitution Act, either as a fixed sum, or as an amount variable on a sliding scale) should be. the first  charge upon it.   12. If   tlie  Customs  revenue -  attributable  to Ireland in any year is less than-the amount fixed as the &quot; contribution to Imperial Services,&quot; the balance of that amount should be written  off  as irrecoverable.  13. If  the Customs  revenue  exceeds the Im- perial contribution,  the balance should be at thedisposal  of  the Irish Government.  14. This arrangement will have the followingadvantages:   (1). It recognises in principle IrelamFs  claim      to. fiscal autonomy.  (2). It meets, in  practice, the  difficulties felt      by  Ulster.  (3.) It leaves Ireland full control over revenues      sufficient to meet the&apos;cost of her services.  (4). It   removes  the  vexed  question of  an      Imperial contribution from the sphere of      controversy.  (5). It  makes easy the transition to a Federal     . System, should such  become probable in      the future.
   15.  It  would be easy to add  to this arrange-&apos; ment&quot;provisions for the prevention of dumping,1 as between  Great Britain and  Ireland, on the lines already suggested.  A draft indicating the kind Of provisions which would  be necessary  is set out below. DRAFT  ANTIDUMPING  PROVISIONS.   (1).  ^Phere shall be  established a Board to be called  the Joint  Customs  Board,  consisting  of two members appointed by the Treasury, and a Chairman appointed by His Majesty.   (2).  If  the Irish Government be  of  opinion that the  producers,  growers, .or manufacturers of any article in Ireland are being subjected to unfair  competition through the importation into Ireland from Great Britain of articles which by reason of  State  aid,  industrial combination,  or other cause  are being sold at a  price less than the actual cost of manufacture, distribution, and sale with :the. ;addition ,of a fair  commercial profit; or if  the British Government   .  . (etc.,  etc., mutatis mutandis);  then  the Irish Government, or the British Government, as the ease  may be; may require the Joint Customs Board to investigate the matter.   (3). The  Joint  Customs  Board, on being so required, shall  investigate  the matter -with  all convenient  despatch,  and  shall report  to  both Governments whether in fact such&quot; unfair  corn- petition exists,  and if so, what rate  or rates of Custom Duty or  Duties  Mould be sufficient to counteract it.        .   (4). On the issue of such a report, it  shall be lawful  for the Irish, or British Parliament, as the case may be,  to impose Customs Duties on said articles.of British or Irish.growth, produce,or manufacture  to the extent found by the Joint Customs  Board to be sufficient  to  counteract the unfair competition,   (5). Any  Customs Duties imposed in accord- ance  with the provisions  of the foregoing para- graph shall be immediately discontinued if the Joint Customs Board shall report that the unfair competition which  gave rise to their impositionhas ceased.    FINAL EEPORT OF  THE SUB-COMMITTEE TO THE   In our Interim Report dated November loth, we stated that we had still to consider a proposal to be submitted by Lord Londonderry.    Since the date of that Report we have held two meet- ings, on November 20th and 21st.  On the for- mer  date we made a further attempt to find  a compromise on the fiscal question, but we regret that we were  not  successful.  In view of the continued  disagreement, the Lister  represen- tatives preferred not to  submit any scheme, and Lord Londonderry&apos;s proposals, referred to in our&apos; Interim Report, have,  therefore,  not  been laid before us.   ^Ve , desire  to supplement that Report  by making  certain explanatory amendments in the Provisional  Conclusions  set  forth in  Schedule H.   The note to Head 3,  sub-head  (3) (a) and (b) should ;read:        &apos;;&apos; These  were  deferred for further con-     sideration,  pending  the Report of the Sub-     Committee on Defence.&quot;.G,RAXP COMMITTEE OF THE IRISH CONVENTION.

t                                        It  The  Electoral  Systems  Sub-Committee wasappointed &quot; to consider the  question of ElectoralSystems, Areas and Franchises.&quot;  The  members  of the  Committee were, HisGrace the Archbishop of Dublin (Chairman), theEarl of Granard,  Sir  William Goulding, Bart.,Alderman McCarron, Messrs. R. Waugh; P.  J.0&apos;Neill, T. J. Harbison, and E. E.  Lysaght.  Nine meetings were  held,  in which the generalsubject  was carefully  considered as well as thequestion of how to provide  adequate representa-tion  for minority interests.  The leading Electoral Sysfeihs were  examined,including  Proportional Representation with theSingle  Transferable Vote, and  the  Belgian Sys-tem  with  plural voting plus Proportional Repre-sentation.   The  Secretary  of  the  ProportionalKepresentation  Society also conducted a demon-stratiori election in order  to illustrate  the work.ing details of a  contested election under this sys-teiri.  The  composition of an  Upper  and a LowerHouse,  with respect to numbers, and also to thevarious  elements which  should find representa-tion  in  these assemblies,  was discussed  at con-siderable length.  The  question  of providing  representation forurban interests by grouping  towns of 2,000 popu-latioh and upwards so as to form special  urbanconstituencies was carefully  examined,  and  atable of statistics bearing upon  this  subject isattached herewith.  The   Sub-Committee  desire it  to be  clearlyunderstood that their  recommendations  are notto be  taken as move than provisional  conelu-sions.  If agreement can be reached in the Con-vehtioh by other methods of distribution  of elec-tion, or nomination of  members to either House,they are quite ready to consider them sympathe-ticaily,                 FINDINGS.  The  Sub-Committee agreed that  the Unionistminority should in an Irish Parliament receiverepresentation in excess of its relative  numericalproportion to the rest  of the electorate.  They  also  agreed that  having regard  to thesmallness of the  Unionist  electorate  in  manycounties the Pi&apos;oportional  Representation systemwould  not give  representation to the Unionistminority.  The Sub-Committee  were not prepared to saythat  the Belgian system would meet the  necessi-ties of  the case as  existing  in Ireland.  Tlie  suggestion of nominating  representativesof the minority interest was in general  terms ap-proved.   Nomination to be  by  the  Crown.  The terms of the Representation of the PeopleBill were approved  as to the qualifying period ofresidence  and as  to the  disqualification  of  pau-pers.  It  was the view of a majority of the membersthat  the proposals of this  Bill in regard to man-hood and womanhood  suffrage are desirable aridshould  be extended to  Ireland.  In so far as Trade Unions are concerned, theLabour representatives of  the  SulvCommitteewere of opinion that it  would not be  desirable &apos;that Labour organisations should be empoweredto elect direct representatives to  the  House ofCommons,  as such  action would  in  their viewtend to break  up Trade Unions into pohtical sec-tions.  The  general view  of the Committee  was thatthere should not be  direct representation for In-stitutions in the Lower House, with  the excep-tioU of Universities,  and that in any Irish  redis-tribution  scheme,  the  boroughs  of  Belfast,Dublin,  Cork,  Londonderry,  Limerick,   andWaterford should be retained.   For the remain-iug constituencies redistribution should be on thebasis of population  as fai1 as may be  reasonablypracticable.  As to  the  composition of  an Irish  House ofCommons the  view was expressed that the  mem-bership should be  197,  of whom 157  should  beelected and  40 nominated by the Crown in  theinterests of the  Unionist minority.   The distri-bution of those elected to be as follows:     Borough of Belfast   ...       ...     14                Dublin   ...       ... :    11                Cork     ...       ...     4                Derry    ...       ...     2         ,,     Limerick      ,   ...     2         ,,     Waterford         ...     1    University of Dublin ...       ...     2                  Belfast          ...     1    National University   ...       ...     1    Elected      ...      ...       ...    119    Nominated           ...       ...     40                                       197  These views are subject to the qualifications:       That the  Labour  members of the  Sub-    Committee  did not  approve of University    representation, and that the  Chairman pre-    ferred a smaller number of nominated rnem-    bers and a number of elected representatives    for other interests or institutions.  The question  of  enlarging  the area of  Dublinborough so as to include the  Metropolitan Policearea and  give  Dublin 14  membeis  and  reducethe County Dublin representation by three mem-bers was  after  consideration left to the GrandCommittee.               THE   SENATE.  It was suggested that  the  Senate should con-sist of  GO members  and  be  composed  as  fol-lows:                                    .   .        4 Bishops, R.C. Church.        2 Bishops, Church of Ireland.        1 representative,  Presbyterian Crmrch;        1 Lord  Chancellor.      15 Representative  Peers.      15 nominated by the Crown.        3 to be elected for Connaughl.        5                  Munster.        6         ,,         Leinster.       8         ,,         Ulster.      GOREPORT  OP  SUB-COMMITTEE  ON  ELECTORAL  SYSTEMS  AND  AREAS.                                  (I. C. No. 18.)
   These provincial representatives to  be elected by popular vote on the General Franchise.   .&apos;1&apos;A   Tenure of office generally to be  ten  years, and., all members to be unpaid.   It was the opinion of the Committee that there should be a certain number of persons elected to the Upper House on a popular franchise.   The Chairman  and. Sir William  Goulding  dissented from this view.   On the ^representation  . of  the  Labour  mem- bers it was agreed not to recommend  the direct- representation of Labour in  the  Upper House,. consequently,  Mr. Lysaght,  Mr.  Harbison,  and Lord Granard held that there should not be any direct  representation from  Chambers  of  Com- merce.  Notwithstanding, the suggested absence of such Labour representation the  Chairman, Sir William Gouldiug, and Mr. P. J. 0&apos;Neill thought that commercial interests should  be represented in the  Upper House.  The  Committee were divided on the question as to whether  there should be any  representationfor bodies such as the Incorporated Law Society,the Benchers, the College of  Surgeons, College \of Physicians, Board of Agriculture, Royal IrishAcademy, and Royal Dublin  Society.   Those in&apos;favour  of such representation  were  Sir  William Gbulding, Mr. Lysaght,  Mr.  0&apos;Neill,  Mr.  Har-bison,  and the Chairman.  The other  membersof the Committee were opposed to any represen-tation of such special interests.  In the  opinion .of the  Committee it was notnecessary to  provide  specially for the inclusion of Law Lords in the. Upper House,  as the judi-cial element would probably be fully represented through other sections.   Section 12,  sub-section 3,  of the  Government of Ireland Act, 1914, as follows, was approved:       &quot; Any Peer whether  of the United King-    dom, Great Britain,  England, Scotland, or    Ireland shall be qualified  to be a member of    either House,&quot; SPECIAL REPRESENTATION  OF URBAN                INTERESTS.  The  question  of  giving special  representationto urban populations having, at the request ofLord Southborough, been further considered, thefollowing&quot; opinion was expressed:   On the hypothesis that the quota for rural con-stituencies should be 35,000, and for urban consti-tuencies 20,000, it  would appear that the num-ber  of  menibers  representing  urban  interestsmight  be  about 62, while  rural members wouldbe about 91.  On the simpler hypothesis on the&apos;other hand that equal weight should  be given tothe urban and rural vote, and that the quota foreach constituency should be 30,000, the numberof urban  members would  be   about 42,  while there would be about 111 rural  members.   Thus, so far as  the Sub-Committee, can see, after de- tailed  examination, the effect of carrying out Lord Southborough&apos;s suggestion would be to in- erease the urban representation by about 24 in a House of 157 members.   It would  increase the urban representation in the province of Ulster from 20 to 29.  &apos;  Another method of strengthening the urban re-presentation was proposed by Mr. Lysaght, viz.,that the existing small boroughs of Newry, Gal-way, and Kilkenny be retained, and that similarrepresentation be  extended to towns  of  10,000inhabitants  and upwards.   Under this: proposalthe towns of Lisburn, Lurgan,  Portadown, Bally-mena,  Dundalk,  Drogheda, Wexford, Clonmel,Tralee,  and Sligo would  each  be  entitled  to oneParliamentary representative as their respectivepopulations exceed 10,000.  Ten  new  boroughs would thus be created  inaddition  to the existing  three proposed to he  re-tained&apos;. . Under this . scheme the  urban representationwould  be 50,  and the non-urban 1Q3,  togetherwith four University members.           (Signed),     JOHN  DUBLIN,             Chairman  of Sub-Committee.  NOTE ON URBAN REPRESENTATION.              BY E. LYSAGHT.  The  principle proposed by  Lord Southboroughin his-letter  to the, Sub-Committee of fixing avery much lower  quota for urban divisions thanfor  rural is open to  the objection:  That it isfrankly undemocratic.  Again, grouping of small towns is open, as wehave  seen,  to  the objection that the  smallertowns  are  semi-rural,  and  that such  groupingcould not be successfully carried out.  We haveseen that Lord  Southborough&apos;s  proposal wouldincrease  the urban representation in  an IrishParliament.  It is possible to do this, I  think, by-a simplermeans, viz., to recognise the principle hitherto inoperation in  Ireland of  separate  representationfor  the larger towns even though they are veryconsiderably below  the quota decided upon.  Newry, Galway,  and Kilkenny now have suchseparate representation.  I would  jropose that  this be continued,  andextended to all towns  of similar size.   If repre-sentation be extended to towns of 10,000 inhabit-ants and over,  ten new boroughs would be  en-franchised in addition  to the three I  would pro-pose to retain, but which it has hitherto beenagreed to disfranchise.   Lisburn, Lurgan, Porta-down,  Ballymena, Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford,Clonmel, Tralee,  Sligo are  all  over  10,000 in-habitants.  The constituencies would then be as shown onattached Schedule, giving 50  urban and 106 ruralmembers and four University members.  Withfour University members the lower house wouldthen contain less than  two-thirds rural menibers.  The result is  only seven less  urban  membersthan that  arrived  at  by adopting Lord South-borough^ suggestion.  .  In  the attached Schedule I. have  given  themembers and population per county rather thanper division, because.the size of the, divisions de-pends on. whether the. principle of ProportionalRepresentation be adopted or not.

But ifthe boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry be ex-cluded, the grand total for the remaining thirty-seven Ulster  towns is only 185,340.  In additioneighteen of Ulster&apos;s thirty-seven towns are in thecounties of Antrim and Down,  and  their jointpopulation is 98,033,  or considerably  more thanhalf the total for Ulster towns.  Separate repre-sentation for  the urban interests  of Antrim andDown is possible by a system of grouping.  It isalso practicable in County Armagh to the extentthat  Portadown and Lurgan being in the  sameconstituency   and  contiguous could   easily  begrouped.  It  should  be  pointed out that in  many&apos; in-stances the smaller towns  are strictly rural, orrather   non-industrial  in  their interests, beingmerely  market  towns, and not  manufacturingcentres.MEMORANDUM  ON URBAN  REPRESEN-                  TATION.(AS  SUBMITTED TO THE ELECTORAL SYSTEMS SUB-                  COMMITTEE.)

  In the province of Leinster there is  a similarconcentration of urban population in one or twoareas and diffusion in the rest of the province.  Inthe county, of Dublin  the townships of Kings-town, Pembroke,  and  Rathmines  account for84,353  out of a total of 101,963.  These townsmay be regarded rather  as  suburbs of  Dublinthan as distinctive civic entities.  Drogheda andDundalk in county Louth, though somewhat re-mote from each other, could be grouped similarlyto Portadown and Lurgan, but many other townsin Leinster would require special grouping.-  The  figures  for the  respective provinces andcounties are  attached herewith.IRISH  STATISTICS.

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS  SUB-COMMITTEE.  SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT TO GRAND COMMITTEE.  The Grand Committee of the Irish Conventionhaving considered  the  report  of  the  ElectoralSystems  Committee sent the  following furtherReference to  the  latter body  for considerationand report.  The Grand  Committee  accepted the principlethat urban and industrial interests should receivemore than proportionate representation, and re-quested  the  Sub-Committee  on Electoral  Sys-tems to prepare a scheme to  carry this *out bythe grouping  of small towns  to  form separateconstituencies, the quota for these constituenciesto be about 20,000.  Towns with a populationbelow 3,000 only to be included in  such consti-tuencies if they are of a  distinctly industrialcharacter.

Their  aggregate sub-stantially exceeds 80,000, and they would  there-fore  on the  20,000  quota be  entitled to foui;representatives, which would  make the  grandtotal of urban  representatives  for Ireland fifty-four.  If included in the borough of Dublin, theborough would  be entitled  to three more  mem-bers  than are credited to.  it in the above list.The grand total in that case would be fifty-three.  The  Sub-Committee understands  that  therewould probably be opposition to inclusion in theborough of Dublin.  It  will be  observed&apos;that in some of the group-ings the figure of population is  slightly below the20,000 quota.&quot;  In two instances towns  of lessthan 3,000 population are included on the groundthat  they are specially industrial.  The  attention of  the Grand Committee is in-vited  to  the  changes which the  suggested newconstituencies would involve  in the Parliamen-tary  areas to which they at present belong. Thegrouping of Dundalk and Drogheda,  for example,would  reduce  County Louth  from  63,665  to38,036, and  North Armagh would be reduced byover  one-half.   Every area touched would ob-viously be substantially affected  by the  changeand  re-adjustment  of  the boundaries of  ruralParliamentary divisions would clearly have to bemade in a considerable number  of cases in orderto prevent anomaly and injustice.  The fixing ofsuch boundaries demands expert knowledge,  andalso is outside the Terms of Reference submittedto us.  The grouping suggested above  is, in the opinionof the  Committee,  the most  convenient  andworkable that they  can devise  in  the  circum-stances.  The population of the above gnmpedtowns is 352,350, leaving a population of 257,093in towns of 2,000 and  upwards, which do  notconform to the Terms of Reference,  or are in-capable of being suitably grouped.  In  considering  the  Terms of  Reference  in-dicated  in this Supplemental Report, Sir Craw-ford McCullagh and Mr. H. B. Armstrong, D.L.,joined the. Sub-Committee  and are  associatedwith the recommendations  as above.  The Sub-Committee  are  under the greatestobligations   to their  Secretary, Mr. ThomasMoles, for the invaluable services which he  hasrendered to them throughout.

Arrangements to be made  to permit the Irish  Government, if they so  desire, to defer  taking over the services  relating to Land Purchase,  OldAge Pensions, National  Insurance,  Labour  Ex- clmnges, Post Office Trustee Savings  Banks,  andFriendly Societies.       Discussed,  but  not  definitely decided by    the Committee.  Li so far as Land Purchase    is concerned, reference should be made to    the report of the  Sub-Conimittee..
PART  I.MEMORANDUM  BY  SOUTHERN  UNIONISTS.            FISCAL   AUTONOMY.                  (I.  C No. 21.)  The Chairman of the Convention having statedthat in his opinion a deadlock appeared to havebeen reached in reference to the- question whetherIreland should have complete fiscal control, it isnecessary that I should add something on behalfof those whom I represent in order to make clearour attitude on this question.  While we have not changed our view that thepreservation  of the Union of Great Britain&quot; andIreland under the Imperial Parhament is still thebest policy for both countries, we entered the Con-vention at the urgent request of H.M. Governmentwith the  desire to  consider what concession couldbe made to Nationalist opinion in regard to a Con-stitution, with safety to the Empire, security forthe  minority, and  if  possible,  the  participationof all sections in Irish Government which couldnot be obtained under the Act  of 1914.  We have endeavoured loyally to co-operate withour colleagues in the Convention to this end, andwe  recognise their desire to provide the minoritywith a fair representation in both Houses of theproposed  Parhament.    Assuming  tins   to  besecured, and that adequate arrangements for safe-guarding the  special  interests  of  Ulster  can beagreed  upon, we  have no desire to circumscribetoo  closely the powers of the new  Irish Bodies inregard to internal administration.  But the  discussions  which have arisen  on thequestion  of Fiscal Autonomy open a  new vistaof Irish  claims, which  was  wholly  unexpected byus.   We  have   contemplated  &apos;  a   Parhamentgenuinely subordinate  to that  of  Great Britain,and that Ireland,  which must be  dependent onGreat Britain for defence and for Foreign Policy,would  send  representatives  to  Westminster %tosafeguard her interests, and  to  represent  her inregard to taxation not- of an internal character.  The Nationalist representatives have claimed forIreland a similar right  in connection with treatiesto that enjoyed by the Dominions.  The  proba-bility of  divergence from Great Britain on fiscalquestions  seems  to us  to  have been  suggested,and the necessity of Ireland being free to plaj^ herown hand  in  these matters asserted.  It is noteworthy that while independent powersfor Ireland in regard to finance and administrationare  claimed,  and  Great Britain&apos;s  willingness tomidertake her defence is assumed, there is no clearadmission of responsibility for the liabilities winchIreland has incurred,  and will incur,  to  GreatBritain in  this respect.  We are convinced &quot;that the future prosperity andsecurity of the country can  only  be secured  bythe  representation of  Ireland in the British Par-liament, and by leaving all taxation which is thesubject of treaty in the hands of that Parhament.Indeed, we beheve this coimection to be vital inthe  interests  of the Empire.  This contention is not inconsistent with Irelandhaving the desired control of her own affairs,  andof direct  internal taxation,  with  ample   meansto pay her way, but if Ireland is stih to remainan integral part of the British Empire, she must heprepared  to make some sacrifice  commensurateto that which  Great  Britain is making.   Ireland,  notwithstanding  the  present   WarTaxation,  is apparently increasing in  prosperityby leaps  and bounds.   If she is assured of herpresent expenditure,  and the power of increasingrevenue for development, she cannot but contributereasonably  to  the iimnense deficit which  GreatBritain has to face.   If Great Britain were willing to accept as a con-tribution  to the War debt and to the Army andNavjr the product of the  Customs, which nowamount to   6,600,000 and may probably be in-creased, Ireland  (omitting Excess Profits) wouldstill retain  some   12,000,000  tax  revenue,  with 1,600,000  from  Postal  and non-tax revenue,against  12,500,000 of expenditure.   There wouldthen  be a considerable surplus which may be in-creased when the Super-tax on Irish Revenue nowpaid in London is levied locally, as it  must be inthe future, if  a Parhament is estabhshed.   On the most favourable computation for Ireland,the debt charges for  which her taxable capacity,whether reckoned at one-twentieth or one-twenty-fifth of Great Britain, should render her hable, wouldnow amount to  12,000,000 annually apart from hershare of Defence and War Pensions which would be atthe least   6,000,000 more.   Ireland would havereceived exceptionally generous treatment by sucha settlement seeing that Great Britain will have adeficit of  say,   150,000,000 per annum to meet,while retaining&quot; all existing taxation except excessprofits.  To  clothe Ireland  with the  right  of makingtreaties and to demand an equal voice with GreatBritain on questions wlhch are common to the wholeEmpire, and which may shortly be  the subject ofFederation, would  set up  a  Government on theColonial model with only the link of the Crown,separate from Great Britain, though at a few milesdistance.   It  has  been  admitted that to avoidcontinual  friction it would be necessary to secureFree  Trade between  Great Britain  and Ireland.The interests  of both countries make  a commondefence a necessity, and we beheve that the powernow claimed for Ireland to negotiate for 4,000,000of people on an equahty with 44,000,000 while shecannot pay her proper share of defence, is  quiteinadmissible.  Our proposals then are as follows :   We  reserve  to  Great  Britain the   Sovereignpower of the King, fuU authority for  the Navy,Arrnj&apos;, and Imperial Sendees, and for the levyingof Customs, and this responsibility involves thecontinued  presence  of  Irish  representatives  atWestminster,  although  in diminished  numbers.We think  that the question  of excise calls forspecial treatment.   The full amount reahsed byCustoms should be retained by Great Britain as anImperial contribution,                                     L2
rresponse to the appeal of H.M. Government underthe special circumstances of the time, we have madesacrifice of principles very dear to us in the hopethat by mutual agreement as Irishmen we may heallong standing differences.   We believe the proposals outlined above, whichgive wide powers of self-government  to Ireland,preserve  to  the  British  Government  those onlywhich are necessary for the unity and security ofthe United Kingdom, and which would be reservedto the  Central Government under any system ofFederation  which maj^ unite the Empire  in  thefuture.                            MIDLETON.26th November, 1917.PABT II.PBOPOSALS BY  SOUTHERN UNIONISTS AS TO JOINT REVENUE BOARD.  Under the  proposals  made  by  the SouthernUnionists, Customs duties will  be imposed underthe authority of the Parliament of ,rthe&apos; UnitedKingdom and Excise duties  under the authorityof the Irish Parliament.  A substantial amount of the  Customs duties onarticles ultimat^y consumed in Ireland is collectedat British ports, and it is desirable to frame somemachinery for establishing  what the true revenueproduced by Ireland is after the two Exchequersare separated.  This  is the more  necessary as  the  Customsduties and Excess Profits receipts are only to beassigned to meet the Imperial contribution duringthe war, and  until the Commission proposed byLord  MacDonnell has reported what the futurecontribution of Ireland should  be. Meantime anydeficit in other Irish  revenue will  be made upfrom  Customs receipts if necessary.  The proposed separate Excise regime in Irelandwill make it &quot;necessary to  regulate  the  traffic inexcisable articles  between the two countries so asto  protect the revenue  and prevent smugglingwhile causing the least possible inconvenience tolegitimate trade.  The most  convenient  method of  fidfilling thetwo purposes indicated  would seem  to be thecreation of  a  Joint Revenue Board on  the linesof the Joint Exchequer Board contemplated bythe Act of 1914, consisting  of two British and twoIrish  representatives with  a  Chairman appointedby His Majesty.  The function described above would not exhaustthe usefulness of the proposed Board..   Its dutiesshould be :    1. To  determine  the  true  Customs revenue of    Ireland and to set up  appropriate, machinery    for the purpose in the form of actual records    of traffic.  2. To  regulate the  payment of  drawback on    exportation,  and  the  levying  of  duty on    importation  of excisable  articles  from one    country into the other;  and to provide for    the  mutual  interchange  between  the  two  coimtries  of  the  information  necessary to  prevent illicit traffic.   (For example, if Irish  spirits be exported to England, the EngliJi  revenue authorities would be notified when  drawback was claimed, so that the charging  of Customs duty might follow automatically).3.  To  determine  any questions  which might  arise, in the case of direct taxation, as to the  respective rights of England and  Ireland to  levy tax  on property or  income  when  the  owner of such property or income was resident  partly in England  and partly in Ireland.  No  property or income should be liable to pay  double tax, and the Joint Board should give  a final decision which woidd render reference  to the Court imnecessarj&apos;-,  and relieve the tax-  payer from liability to proceedings brought  by the revenue authorities to determine their  respective  claims.    A  considerable increase  of Irish  revenue  is  anticipated  from  this  source.4.  The Board would^also be charged with the  duty of advising the respective Governments  on cases of &quot; dumping &quot; designed  to damage  Irish industries.    The Board would  not be  directly  con-  cerned with  the  collection of revenue  but  would act partly  in an advisory and partly  in a judicial capacity, and would  determine  all questions of account  which might arise  between the two  countries.5.  To  consider the relative proportions of in-  direct  and direct  taxation in  Leland,  and  if the percentage  of revenue from Customs  and  Excise to  total tax revenue  in Ireland  exceeds in two  consecutive years the similar  percentage in Great Britain by  15 per cent.  to report  the same to the Irish Parliament.    Should  the  Irish  Parliament  thereupon  resolve that any Customs duties on articles  of general consumption act oppressively to,  the Lrish  population,  the Board shall so re-  port to the  British  Parliament,  and such  report shall be  a  ground for the  equitable  readjustment of such duties.  We are ready,  if the Irish Parliament be con-stituted as proposed with fair representation  ofthe minority and other effective safeguards whichare in our view essential,  to concede to it controlof  internal  taxes,  administration,   legislation,judicature, and police.  On these lines we believethat all legitimate  National  aspirations  will  besatisfied.    We are  not  prepared to  jeopardisethe Imperial connection  by conceding more  ex-treme  demands.   In  thus co-operating to transfer  to an IrishExecutive ^responsibility  to  an Irish &apos; Parliamentfor its internal affairs, we have gone  as we believeto,the extreme unfit of safety from the Imperialstandpoint,  having  regard  to the  geographicalcontiguity of Ireland to  Great  Britain and  hersocial  and political conditions.   To do  this, in
STATEMENT  MADE  BY THE CHAIRMAN TO THE CONVENTION AT THE BEQUEST                          OF THE GRAND COMMITTEE.                                      (I.  C. No. 19).  By a resolution passed at Cork on the 25thSeptember the  Convention  referred  to  us  thevarious schemes which  had  been submitted anddiscussed, and instructed us, if possible, to. pre-pare a scheme for submission to the Conventionwhich would meet with the views and difficultiesexpressed by the  different speakers  during  thecourse of the debates.  We  had hoped  that  it might be possible tosummon the  Convention at  an earlier date,  andreport the completion  of  our  task.   Unfortu-nately we have  not yet succeeded in completingit.   We  have, however, made  considerable pro-gress. and we think that, we have reached a pointat which we should give the Convention  an ac-count of our  deliberations.  We  held our  first meeting for the purpose ofthe  task entrusted to us on September 27th  andthen decided  to adjourn  until  October  11th inorder to enable  the necessary  preparatory workto be carried out by the Secretariat.  On October11th we decided to appoint a Sub-Committee ofnine members with instructions to sit in privateto endeavour to  find a basis for agreement and toreport to us.  On October 15th we decided thatthere were several important questions the con-sideration of  which might conveniently be under-taken while the Sub-Committee of Nine was en-gaged in its deliberations, and that this considera-tion could most conveniently  be  carried on bygroups consisting of members of the Grand Com-mittee with  the, addition of  certain other  mem-bers of the Convention.  These groups were sub-sequently constituted into three Sub-Committeeswith the  following terms of  reference:    (1). To  consider  questions  of  franchise  and         electoral  systems  and  areas in relation         to an Irish Parliament.   (2). To enquire into the problems presented by         land purchase in Ireland.   (3). To consider (a)  what powers of local de-         fence  might he  delegated to an  Irish         Government  consistently  with the  re-         quirements of  Imperial defence; (b) the         future  of the  Royal Irish Constabulary         and the Dubhn Metropolitan Police.   The  Sub-Committee  of  Nine   appointed  onOctober 11th held a large  number of meetingsand submitted to us two reports dated November15th and November 21st which have since beenreceiving our detailed  consideration.  The Sub-Committee  were  able  to arrive at certain  pro-visional conclusions on a considerable number ofquestions.  They  did not,  however, succeed inreaching  an  agreement upon all matters, and itwas definitely  understood that the provisionalconclusions were  not to be  regarded as binding&quot; unless  an  agreement  should  ultimately  bereached.upon a  general scheme.&quot;   The most im-portant question upon which agreement was notfound possible in the Sub-Committee was that ofthe financial powers to  be entrusted to an IrishParliament.  We  submit for the consideration of the Con-vention a statement (I. C. No. 20)* showing theposition which we have reached up to the presenton the whole reference.  We desire to emphasisethe fact already indicated that in every case ourprovisional  conclusions  are  dependent  upon  ageneral agreement  being  ultimately reached  onthe important question  which still divides us.  The Sub-Committee considered  proposals sub-mitted by the Bishop of Raphoe,  which gave toan  Irish  Parliament complete  control over  allforms  of taxation.  The Unionist representativeswere  unable to accept  these proposals  and theUlster Unionists desired that the complete fiscalunity  of  the  United Kingdom should be  main-taihed and that all powers of taxation should con-tinue to rest, as at present,  with the Parliamentof the United Kingdom.  Much of our time andthought has been  occupied  in an endeavour tofind a compromise  between these two  extremepositions,  and the most  recent  proposal  whichhas engaged our attention is one submitted byLord  Midleton  on  behalf   of   the   SouthernUnionists  which would leave the  imposition andcollection of customs duties  to the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom and  make the receipts fromthis source of revenue  the Irish  contribution to-wards the cost of  Imperial  services.   The  mainfeatures of this proposal are  set out in the docu-ment  marked I. C.  No. 21 which is being circu-lated to the Convention, f   We submit to the Convention for  their con-sideration the report of the Sub-Committee onelectoral  systems,  and  it will be  seen from thestatement of our provisional conclusions that wehave,  to a large  extent,  accepted their recom-mendations.   We also submit to the Convention the very im-portant  report of  the  Sub-Committee  on landpurchase.   We have not been able to give  thisreport  the detailed consideration which it  de-serves, but we are able to state that we  are inagreement with the principles underlying it.   The  Sub-Committee  on defence has not beenable to complete its deliberations,  in the absenceof  information which  is  being sought from theAdmiralty and the  War Office.  We therefore re-commend that consideration  of this  questionshould be deferred  until  the Sub-Committee isable to report.   We are of opinion that the Convention can use-fully consider how  far it is able to concur in theprovisional conclusions  which we have recordedand  the  recommendations   contained  in  theseveral reports which we  have submitted to it.* See Appendix VI.t See Appendix VII.

         REPORT   OF   SUB-COMMITl  We,  the  Sub-Committee  appointed by the Grand Committee  of  the Irish  Convention, on 1st November, 1917, &quot; to inquire into the prob- lems presented by land purchase in Ireland &quot; held thirteen sittings to examine the problems referred to us.  In  the course of our proceedings we have had the  advantage of ascertaining the views  of Sir Henry Doran,  of  the  Congested Districts Board, and the Bt. Hon. F. S.  Wrench and Mr. W. H. Stuart, Estates Commissioners, on certain points.  On the 4th December we signed a report which was duly presented to the Grand Committee and subsequently brought  before  the  Convention. This report was discussed by the Convention on the 8th,  9th, and 10th January,  1918,  and was referred back to the Sub-Committee with the re- quest that we  should consider  certain amend- ments.  We did so on  the loth,  16th, and 23rd January,   and  unanimously  recommended the adoption of certain amendments which we have incorporated in the following Report which we now have the honour of presenting:      Assumption underlying  deliberations.  1. We have proceeded on the assumption that the duty laid upon us was to inquire into the prob- lems presented by land purchase, not under the existing form of government but as part of a large  scheme  for  re-casting the framework  of government in  Ireland.  Accordingly, we have in our deliberations assumed that an Irish Parlia- ment,  with an Irish   Executive   responsible thereto, is  to be set up by an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Bri- tain and Ireland, and  that  an  Irish  Exchequer and an Irish Consolidated Fund, distinct from the present Exchequer and Consolidated Fund of Great Britain  and  Ireland,  are  to  be similarly established.  We desire to offer  no  opinion,  in this Report, as to the desirability  of this change, but we wish to make it quite clear that our re-commendations are based on the  assumption men- tioned and cannot be taken as agreed to on any other hypothesis.           Problems to  be considered.  2: The problems  we  have considered may be grouped under three main heads:       I.  Those connected with land which is the           subject of  completed sales under the           Land Purchase Acts.     IT. Those connected with land which is the           subject of  pending proceedings  under           these Acts.    III. Those connected  with  land which has           not as yet been the subject of proceed-           ings under these Acts.  The following table gives particulars of the land (I.) already  sold,  (II.) agreed  to be sold,  and (III.) not  made  the  subject  of proceedings forsale up to  the 31st March last:                          Area   Poor Law  Purchase         No. of Holdings.

(see pp. 97-8).      ON  LAND  PURCHASE.               I.  Completed  Sales.   3. The problems presented by land already sold are confined  to three &quot;main points, (1) the collec- tion of the purchase annuities and  the  liability for loss caused by default in payment thereof, (2) the liability for  excess stock and bonus,  and (3) the  powers  exercisable  over  tenant purchasers and their holdings.  Similar points will  arise in respect of land the subject of  pending cases and in respect of land not  yet  the subject of sale proceedings  as  soon as such  land  is  vested in tenant  purchasers;  and  the  recommendations made beiow  apply to the latter as well as to the former.              Collection of Annuities.   4. The existing arrangements for the collection of purchase annuities and for meeting loss caused by default in payment, as well as the arrange- ments  proposed  under the  Home Rule Bill of 1893 and the Government of Ireland  Act of 1914, are fully explained in  Schedule II.  (See  pp. 98-100). We are of opinion that the arrangements suggested in the  above  mentioned measures for &quot;making the Irish Consolidated Fund liable for any loss caused by non-payment of annuities  (which at  present  falls,  for  the most  part, on Irish funds), were sound (see  Schedule II., paragraphs 12  and 13), but that  the  arrangements  for treating the collection  of annuities  as  a &quot; re- served &quot; service (see Schedule II., paragraph 14, p. 99) are no longer desirable.  We are of opinion that the Government that is responsible  for any loss caused  by  the non-payment  of  annuities should  be  charged with  the collection  of these annuities.    (See paragraphs 40-1 and Schedule II.,  p.  98).   We  therefore  recommend that all purchase annuities should be  collected by a de- partment of  the  Irish Government,  that  the an- nuities  should be paid into the  Irish Consolidated Fund,  that the full amount collectible should be paid over to the Consolidated Fund of Great Bri- tain and Ireland  on  fixed dates,  and that such payment should  be a first charge on the Irish Consolidated  Fund.   It would,  of  course be within the discretion of the  Irish Parliament to continue the  present process  of making the funds of each county liable for all loss caused by default within that county (see  Schedule II., paragraph 10, p.  99).   We consider- that  the cost of collec- tion of these  annuities should be regarded as Im- perial expenditure  and  therefore treated  as  ex- plained in the next paragraph.  Possibly it would conduce to  economical  administration and ob- viate friction if this expenditure were  limited to a percentage  on the  amount collectible.            Excess  Stock and Bonus.   5. The liability for excess stock and bonus is- fully described in Schedule III. (See pp. 100-2). It is sufficient to say here that  the liability in re- spect  of sales completed on or before the 31st&quot;March  last now amounts to  753,00 per annum, payable until the capital charge is amortised.  Of this total,  160,000 is paid out of the  vote for the Ireland Development Grant,  and  593,000 out of the  Land Commission  Vote.   We  are  of opinion that this charge, like the cost of collection of purchase annuities, though incurred in respect of an Irish  service, is clearly an Imperial obliga- tion.  While, therefore, we recommend that this annual sum ought to be paid out of the Irish Con- solidated Fund,   we hold  that Great Britain&apos;s share thereof, if not repaid to the Irish Govern- ment, should be reckoned as a payment pro tanto by Ireland of whatever contribution Ireland is to make towards Imperial expenditure.
   Powers exercisable over Tenant Purchasers.  6. Certain powers are, in most  cases, at pre-sent possessed over holdings bought under  theLand Purchase Acts,  during the continuance ofthe liability for the payment of purchase annui-ties, viz:   (a) The permission of the Land Commission is        required  for  sub-division  or sub-letting        of  such - holdings  (see  section 54  of        Irish Land Act, 1903.)  (b) The permission of the Land Commission is        required  for  the  mortgaging   of  such         holdings  beyond  a certain limit  (ten         times  the  amount  of  the  purchase         annuity,  see section 54 (3) of Irish Land         Act, 1903, as amended by  section 2 of         Irish Land Act, 1907).   (c) The permission of the Land  Commission is         required  for  the  acquisition,  beyond a         certain limit, of holdings subject to land         purchase annuities (see Irish Land Act,         1909, section 32 (1)).   (d) The Land Commission may prosecute ten-         ant purchasers for breach of regulations,         if  any,  as to turbary on holdings  (see *         section 21 of Irish Land Act, 1903), and         may  also  prosecute  tenant purchasers         who  cut &quot;certain  timber  (necessary for         the  ornament  or shelter of a holding)         without  the  permission of  the Depart-         ment of Agriculture  and Technical  In-         struction (see   section 32  (2)  of  Irish         Land Act, 1909).   (e) The Land Commission has power in certain         cases  to  determine  disputes  between         tenant purchasers and others  (see sec-         tion 22 of Irish Land  Act,  1903), and it         also possesses  certain powers in respect         of mineral rights  and, in certain cases,         in respect of sporting  rights (see section         13 of Irish  Land Act, 1903,  section  1         of Irish  Land  Act, 1907, and section 37         of  Irish  Land Act,   1909).    We are of opinion  that these powers  should in future be exercised by  a department of the Irish Government.               II. Pending Oases.    7. The special problems connected  with land agreed to be  sold but  the  sale of which has not yet been completed  are mainly  financial.   The purchase money in respect of the  100,000 hold- ings affected by pending agreements is just under 24 million ,pounds  of which,  it  is  estimated, nearly 19  millions must be provided in cash and the balance in stock, partly in 2f per cent, stock but mainly in 3 per  cent, stock.  The raising  of the cash by either stock will involve the issue  of a large amount  of excess stock, the annual cost of which and of  the bonus payable under the pre-  sent law will amount, it is estimated, at present prices, to at least  580,000 a year.  (See Sche- dule III., paragraphs 10-12, pp. 101-2).  We are of  opinion that all these pending cases must be com-  pleted on the basis of the agreements  made and  in accordance with the existing financial system  of land purchase.  We desire, however, to bring  to notice the case of landlords who  agreed to sell  under the Act of 1909  (in accordance with which  payment is to be made in 3 per cent, stock), but  whose sales have not  yet been completed.   The  total purchase money in these cases amounts to  about   4,500,000.  At the time when most of  these landlords agreed to sell, the  stock stood at   over 80, but, in consequence  of the war, and the  issue of Government  Stocks bearing higher ratesof interest, this stock has fallen to under 60. Con-sequently those landlords who have not receivedpayment must suffer a heavy loss if they haveto sell stock at the present price in order to payoff charges.  The difficulty would, we think, befairly met by paying such landlords so much ofthe purchase money at  the  actual market pricethat prevailed for the stock at the date the agree-ments to sell were signed, as may be proved, tothe satisfaction of the Land Commission, to berequired (over  and above the cash bonus, wherethe landlord is absolute owner) to pay off chargeswhich existed at the date of the agreement to sell,and still exist.*  We recognise  that this recom-mendation will not help those landlords who havealready received payment  in  depreciated stock,but we do not consider it practicable  to make anyrecommendation respecting sales already com-pleted.   We  are   of  opinion  that  the   inaugurationof  a  new   system of  Irish  Government ren-ders  it imperative that  all pending-cases shouldbe speedily  completed.   Accordingly,  we recom-mend that the cash required should be  providedand the stock required issued within three years,at the outside, from the date on which legislative effect  is  given  to  our proposals,  if  they  beaccepted.    As the Land Commission have  cer- tain discretionary powers in respect of these cases, we  are  of opinion  that it should  remain  a &quot; reserved &quot; service,  so far as its  functions  in respect of  pending cases are concerned, on the understanding that these cases will be completed within the time mentioned.   The recommendations made-  in paragraphs  4, 5, and 6 above in respect of completed sales,  as regards the collection of purchase  annuities and the cost thereof, the liability for the loss caused by default in payment of annuities,  the annual charge for excess stock and bonus,  and  the exer- cise  of powers over tenant purchasers,  all apply to pending  sales as soon as they are  completed.  III. Land unaffected by Land Purchase Acts.                 Size of problem.   8. The land not yet affected by the Land  Pur- chase  Acts comprises between one-quarter and one-third of the total agricultural area of Ireland and  its valuation  is over one-third  of the valua- tion of the  agricultural area of  Ireland.   For rea- sons explained  in  Schedule I.  (see pp.  97-8), it is not easy to state precisely&quot; the number of hold- ings which  are contained in this large quantity of land.  On the basis  of the statistics  of holdings issued  by  the  Department  of Agriculture  and Technical Instruction, which seem to be the best basis available, it would appear that  the number  of these holdings  do not  greatly exceed 60,000,  or one-seventh of the number of holdings already  affected by the Land  Purchase Acts.   The dis-  parity between the ratio that the number of  hold-  ings which have passed or are passing under these  Acts bears to the  number  of holdings which  are  as yet unaffected by them (7 to 1), and the ratio  which the area of the land affected  by these Acts  * This suggestion may be illustrated  by the case of a land-  lord who agreed to sell for  10,000 to be  paid in 3 per  cent stock, the  charges on whose estate amounted to   3,000.  If at the time he agreed to sell the stock stood  at 80, he would  have had to  sell   3,750  stock at  that  price in order to redeem these charges.  If by the time  the  purchase money  is paid over the stock has fallen to  60.  the landlord  would have to  sell  5,000  of stock in   order to pay off charges. Under the above suggestion the   landlord would  receive additional  stock to  the amount   necessary ( 1,250) to meet the loss caused by the delay   in payment.  The balance in  stock ( 6,250) left  to the   landlord after  the pavment of charges, and the income   therefrom ( 187 10s. 0d.), would not be directly affected   by the fall in the price of stock.
bears to the area unaffected by them  (less than3 to 1) is due to the fact that a disproportionatenumber of the larger tenanted holdings  and of thelarge holdings of untenanted land remain unsold.*The smaller tenanted holdings  (Le. the holdingsthe price  of which would not exceed the presentstatutory  limitations on the amount of  advances)probably number about 50,000 and constitute themost urgent problem which called for our con-sideration.  It is difficult,  however,  as  will  beseen later, to divorce their consideration from thatof the larger holdings, and the final settlement ofthe tenanted  land of Ireland is intimately con-nected with the  question   of  untenanted  land,especially in the  area  under the  control of theCongested Districts Board and  outside that areain connection with congested estates.        * Desirability ol the speedy completion of Land                   Purchase.  9. We are of opinion that the conversion of thetenants of the smaller  holdings into tenant pur-chasers is inevitable  under any form of  Govern-ment,  due regard being had to  the relief of con-gestion and  the extension of tillage; and that anychange, such as has been assumed above, in theframe  of  Irish Government would make it emi-nently desirable that such  conversion  should, inthe  interests of  landlords,  tenants,   and  theGovernment alike, be speedily effected.  We re-cognise, however, that such a conversion cannotin many cases be immediate having regard  to thefact that  many of the existing holdings requireenlargement or  other improvement  before theyare vested in their occupiers.   We further  recog-nise that  such a conversion  cannot,  under theexisting law, be  universal,  since  the limitationson  the  amount  of advances  prevent  the  largertenanted holdings passing from landlord to tenantunder the present Land Purchase Acts.f  We areof opinion,  however,  that  it would be  unreason-able to ask  landlords after  they had disposed ofthe greater  part  of their tenanted land to con-tinue as landlords of a few isolated large hold-ings-  We are further of opinion that with a radi-cal change in the form of Irish Government, thecompletion of land purchase cannot be  left to thecomparatively slow method of bargaining betweenlandlord and tenant nor be subjected  to amend-ing legislation by  either the Imperial or the IrishParliament.   As regards  untenanted  land, weconsider an  immediate  and universal transfer ne-cessary within the area over which the  CongestedDistricts Board operates (all Connaught, Donegaland Kerry and part  of Clare and Cork)  in orderto  enable that  Board  to  discharge  its  primaryfunction.  On the other hand, we  do not think awholesale transference of  the  untenanted landelsewhere to be practicable.  * By untenanted land is meant land in which no tenancyhas been created and where therefore the owner in fee isalso the rated occupier.  Such land does not cease to beuntenanted by reason of being temporarily let, e.g., on theeleven months&apos;  system.   Land bought under  the LandPurchase Acts and land held under fee-farm grants of anydata is excluded from this classification. 1  tThe main limitation  is that in the case of  a tenancycreated after  1st January, 1901, the advance  shall not ex-ceed  500  (subject to the exception mentioned in Sect. 53of the  Act of 1903), and that  in the  case of other ten-ancies the  advance  shall not exceed  3,000,  though it iswithin the discretion of the Land Commission to make anadvance not  exceeding   5,000, provided the holding isresidential.  No advance can be made in Ihe  case of  atenancy created after the 15th September,  1909, exceptwhere, the  tenancy  was  created by either the CongestedDistricts Board or the  Estates Commissioners.            Main  Recommendations.  10. Accordingly, we  recommend  (a)  that thelandlord s inteiest in all tenanted land, not ex-cepted below (see  paragraph 12), should be auto-matically  transferred  either to  the occupyingtenants, or  to  the State,  as represented  by theCongested Districts Board or the Estates Com-missioners,  for resettlement;  (b)  that  all un-tenanted land  within  the Board&apos;s  area  not ex-cepted below (see paragraphs 22 and 23)  shouldbe automatically  transferred from the owner tothe Board for the same purpose; and (c)  that out-side the Board&apos;s area the existing powers of theEstates Commissioners  to  acquire  untenantedland should be preserved and,  in one case, ex-tended. Change to  be  effected  by Imperial  Legislation.  11. These changes should be effected  by  anAct of the Imperial Parliament,  to be passed con-currently with  a Government of Ireland Act, butthe automatic transfer of land should not operateuntil &quot; the appointed day,&quot; which should be fixedby the  Lord Lieutenant  in  Council.  This date,however, should not be  more  than three yearsafter the passing of the Act.   Power should be re-served to the Lord Lieutenant in Council of fixingdifferent days for  different districts and possiblyfor different purposes.   This postponement of theappointed day  will provide  an  interval  duringwhich  sales may  be effected by agreement be-tween landlords and tenants, but the provision ofthis  interval is suggested  mainly  because  theBoard and the Estates Commissioners will  requiretime to  prepare for the working of the scheme andbecause the Estates Commissioners  will be occu-pied for three years in clearing off pending cases.  The  details of  the scheme can  be most con-veniently considered under two headings (1) Ten-anted Land, (2) Untenanted Land.             TENANTED LAND.               Scope of  Change.  12. We are of opinion that the proposed auto-matic  transfer  of  all  tenanted land  should notapply  to  townparks,  non-agricultural  holdings,holdings the main object  of the letting of whichwas for a residence, nor to any land which, havingregard to its propinquity to a town, possesses, inthe opinion of  the Board or the Estates Com-missioners,  a   substantial  potential or  actualvalue or utility as building ground.  An appealshould  lie from the Board or the Estates Com-missioners to the Judicial Commissioner  on thequestion whether any  land comes  within theabove-mentioned  exceptions.  It   would,  bow-ever, be desirable to provide that where  an estateincludes both agricultural holdings  and non-agri-cultural holdings, the latter may, if the landlordso desires,  and if the  Congested Districts Boardor the Estates  Commissioners approve, be sold tothe tenants &quot;at the same time as the  agriculturalholdings.   As  we have  indicated,  we  are ofopinion that from the passing of the Act until theappointed day  sales may  continue to be effectedby  agreement between landlords and tenants, orbetween landlords and  the  Congested  DistrictsBoard or the Estates Commissioners, on the basisof  the  financial  arrangements proposed later;but we  hold that,  from the passing of the Act, alljudicial revision of rents should cease, except forthe purpose of  converting non-judicial rents intoa basis for  purchase,  as explained  in paragraph29.  We recommend that the  Act  should throwupon landlords the duty of lodging before  the&apos;ap-                                       M
 pointed day copies of such documents (schedules of tenancies, copies of rentals, maps, &amp;c.) as may be required in statutory rules to be made  under the Act.    In connection with  this and similar duties  cast upon landlords  by the scheme (see paragraphs 23 and 29) we  are of  opinion that sec- tion 23, sub-sections (11)  and (12) of the Act of 1903 should apply  mutatis  mutandis  to sales under the new Act.             Position of Landlords.   13. We recommend, as regards rent and interest in  lieu thereof,  (1) that the  landlords right to rent and arrears of rent should continue unaffected by the passing of the Act until the appointed day; (2) that on the appointed day the landlord should cease to be entitled to rent not  already accrued, but that  his right to sue for and recover all rent which had accrued between the gale day immedi- ately prior  to the passing of the  Act and the gale day immediately prior to the appointed day should be preserved; (3) that lie should  be entitled to re- ceive from the Land Commission or the Congested. Districts  Board, as from the gale  day immediately prior to the appointed day, the interest on the purchase money (settled as explained below, see paragraph 31),  and,  where  the  purchase money and bonus  have not been paid  within  one year from the gale day immediately  prior to the ap- pointed day, the landlord  should be also paid, as from one year after  that gale day until the pur- chase money and bonus be paid, interest at 5 per cent, on  the amount of the bonus  to which the landlord will be entitled.   14.  The  interest  of  all ehargeants should, as from the appointed day,  be transferred from the landlord&apos;s  interest  in  the  land  to  the  pur- chase   money  and  to   the  interest   payable thereon.    The  corpus of the  purchase money should  be  distributed and the  bonus paid  as soon as  the landlord  has finally  cleared  his title  and  the final  schedule  of incumbrancers has been settled as at  present.   The  trans- ference of the landlord&apos;s  interest in all his ten- anted holdings from the land  to  the  purchase money should be final as from the appointed day, that is  to say, the landlord should not be affected by any decision  the Estates  Commissioners or the Congested  Districts  Board may  hereafter arrive at  not to vest any of  these holdings  in the tenants, in accordance with.the discretion given to these bodies, as explained below.   (See para- graphs  17-20.)              Position of Tenants.   15. The position of tenants under the scheme suggested can be most conveniently considered under two heads, (I.) tenants  in the area within the control of the Congested Districts Board and (II) tenants elsewhere. I. In the area under  the control  of the Congested                Districts  Board.   16. We recommend that on the appointed day all the interest of the landlords in all  tenanted holdings, not specially excepted (see paragraph 12), within the Congested Districts Board&apos;s area, should  pass to  the Board and that the tenants thereof should be liable to the Board, as from the last preceding gale day, for their existing  rents, subject to such reduction as the Board may deem it desirable to grant,        (a) Holdings passed for  vesting.  17. We are of opinion that the  Board should asspeedily as possible  pass for vesting by the LaudCommission  all holdings the purchase money forwhich would not exceed the  present limitationson  the amount of advances, provided that theBoard did not consider that any of the holdingsin question should be retained for enlargement, orother  improvement, or for  utilisation in  con-nection with the relief of congestion.  The annui-ties to be payable by the tenant purchasers of theholdings thus passed for vesting should be  suchproportion of their former rents as is determinedby  the  appropriate  county percentage,  as ex-plained below.  (See  paragraphs 27-29.)  *  (b) Holdings  not passed for vesting.  18. Over the holdings not thus passed for vest-ing, the Board should possess all  powers neces-sary  for resettlement  including  the  powerspossessed by the former landlords, the  specialpowers now possessed by the Board over  tenantson  estates purchased by the  Board, and such  otherpowers as may be  deemed necessary, includingthe power of continuing tenants as tenants, ofacquiring the tenanfs interest in the whole orpart of any holding  on the  payment of full  com-pensation, and of  declaring the tenant of anyholding the tenant purchaser of  his own  holdingor  of an alternative holding (whether larger orsmaller) at what the Board consider a fair price.We recommend that sales  by the  Board to ten-ants  should  be subject to the present  limitationof   3,000 on the amount of advances but not tothe other restrictions mentioned in the footnoteto  page  55.  In order, however, to conserve forthe relief  of  congestion,   land  at present un-tenanted, we  are  of opinion that no tenancycreated in such  land after 1st  January,  1918,should  operate so as to prevent the CongestedDistricts Board from  acquiring,  as  untenantedland  (see paragraph 23), the land comprised insuch  tenancy.  Where the  Board in consequenceof the limitation of   3,000  sells to a tenant partonly of his holding the Board should, as in  othercases of the  acquisition of  the tenanfs interest,pay full compensation to such tenant for the partof his holding retained by the Board.II.  Outside the area  under the control of the Con-            gested Districts Board.             (a)  Smaller holdings.  19.  We recommend that,  in the area not underthe control of the  Congested Districts  Board, alltenants of holdings  not specially  excepted  (seeparagraph 12), the  purchase  money  for whichwould not exceed the present limitations upon theamount of advances should,  on the appointed day,become provisional tenant purchasers; and shouldautomatically cease  to  be  liable  for  rent notalready accrued,  and  should  become  liable, forpayment to the Land Commission, as  from thelast gale day, of a purchase  annuity to be fixed inaccordance with the scheme  set out below  (seeparagraphs 27-29).   On a day to be specified instatutory -rules made under  the  Act,  all  suchprovisional tenant purchasers should become, asfrom  the appointed  day, tenant purchasers oftheir  holdings,  unless the Estate Commissionershad already declared it undesirable  for any par-ticular pro-visional tenant purchaser to become thetenant purchaser  of  his existing holding,  on theground that  such holding was  so &quot; uneconomic &quot;as to  render improvement, where  possible, essen-tial, or  on the  ground that  for any other reason
the holding could not be vested  ih the occupierwith advantage to the State.  Over holdings soexcepted the Estates Commissioners should pos-sess powers similar to those  mentioned above aspossessed by or to be given to the Congested Dis-tricts  Board over their  tenants  (see  paragraph18).  The  Estates Commissioners could conse-quently acquire such a holding on the payment offull compensation; or could  continue the tenantof such a holding as tenant of that holding; orcould  declare him the tenant purchaser of hisholding, as it exists  or enlarged or otherwise im-proved, or of an alternative holding, at what theyconsidered a fair price.             (b)  Larger holdings.  20.  We recommend that, on the appointed day,the landlords interest in all holdings, not speciallyexcepted (see paragraph 12),  the purchase moneyof which would exceed the present limitations onthe amount of the advances, should automaticallypass to the Estates Commissioners, and that thetenants of such holdings should,  as from the galeday immediately prior to the appointed day, be-come liable for the payment to the Land Commis-sion of their existing, rents  subject to such re-duction,  if any,  as  the  Estates Commissionersmay deem  it advisable to  make.  We  are ofopinion that  the  Commissioners in dealing withthese  larger holdings should have regard to.therelief of congestion, the desirability of increasingthe food supply of the country, and the use madein this respect of  such holdings by the tenants.We therefore recommend that the Estates Com-missioners  should  be empowered, having regardto the  matters mentioned  above,  to acquire thetenant&apos;s interest  in  any of the  said holdings orany part thereof;  or to continue the tenants astenants thereof; or to  sell  to them the whole orpart of their holdings notwithstanding the fac that such sales might be contrary to the existingrestrictions or limitations on advances.   Wherethe whole or any part of  such  a holding is ac-quired by the Estates Commissioners full  com-pensation should be  paid to the tenant-  We  are of opinion that  no advance should bemade for the sale of  a holding where the tenancywas created  after  1st January, 1918,  unless theEstates Commissioners certify that  the  creationof the tenancy was in accordance with  the in-terests of the country.Special Powers for Congested Districts Board and            Estates Commissioners.  21.  In order to enable the Congested DistrictsBoard and the Estates  Commissioners to carrythrough  sales in  the.manner proposed, we con-sider that they should be given full powers to dealwith such questions as boundaries, turbary (dueregard  being paid to the  requirements  of theowner  and his employees), provision of access toturbary and holdings, provision for the future up-keep and repair of embankments and cleaning ofstreams with power,  where necessary, to establisha maintenance rate chargeable on the lands trans-ferred,  amalgamation of small holdings,  vestingand registration of holdings of deceased tenants,and such other powers as may be necessary.           . UNTENANTED LAND.         Demesnes  and Home Farms.   22. We recommend that demesnes and homefarms  should not be  interfered  with  by  thescheme we are proposing, and  that  the  presentrights  of the owner  to purchase such land underthe Land  Purchase  Acts should be  preserved,payment to be made in 5 per cent, stock as pro- posed hereafter (see paragraph 26).   We are also of opinion  that  the  Lish Parliament should  be precluded for a term of twenty years from legis- lating in respect of such land.  Other untenanted land within the Board&apos;s area.   23.  As regards untenanted land other than de- mesnes, home farms, townparks, and plantations, we are of opinion, in view of the  necessity of ac- quiring such land for the relief of congestion, that all such land within  the Board&apos;s  area should,  on the appointed day,  pass automatically from  the owner to the Congested Districts Board, which would thus acquire the landlords&apos; interest in  the whole of their estates  with  the exception of  de- mesnes,  home farms,  plantations and the hold- ings  specially excepted in  paragraph  12.  We recommend that the owner should have the privi- lege, if he so desired, of retaining sporting rights over untenanted land thus sold, and that certain small areas (such as herds&apos; gardens, gamekeepers&apos; cottages, quarries and gravel pits  required in con- nection with the demesnes and home farms, &amp;c.) may be excluded from the sale by agreement be- tween the  owner and the  Congested  Districts Board.   For the purpose of  settling the  price, under the plan  proposed  below  (see  paragraphs 35-6), of the untenanted  land to be transferred, we recommend that all owners of  land within the1 Board&apos;s area (other than  land bought under  the Land Purchase Acts) should be required to lodge with the Board, within a certain  period  after the passing of the Act (to be fixed by  the Land Corn- mission in statutory  rules),  a schedule  and map of all their untenanted land  not excepted above. Other untenanted land outside the Board&apos;s area.   24. As regai-ds untenanted land  outside  the Board&apos;s  area, we are of  opinion that  it is  not practicable to provide that  this untenanted land should automatically pass from the  owner on the appointed day; but we recommend  that the pre- sent  powers of  the  Estates  Commissioners  to acquire untenanted land should be preserved,  in- cluding  their  present powers  of  compulsory acquisition; and  that the powers of the Estates Commissioners  to acquire  untenanted   land  by voluntary agreement with the owner should  be extended to include  the acquisition of such land (a) for resettlement in order to increase  the food production  of the country,  and  (b) on  behalf of the Congested Districts Board, in connection with the relief of congestion within the Board&apos;s area. It might facilitate  both  the Estates  Commis- sioners and the Board in relieving  congestion if they.were given power to  exchange land inter  sc. We further recommend that where the tenanted portion  of an estate includes  congested  holdings and there is on the same estate untenanted land, the Estates Commissioners should be empowered to acquire by compulsion, if necessary, so much of such land as may be required for relieving the congestion  on the estate.   The price to be paid by  the  Estates  Commissioners  for such land should be fixed in the same way as the price of untenanted  land within the Congested  Districts Board&apos;s area is to be fixed  (see pars. 35-6), that is, failing agreement between the owner and the Estates  Commissioners,  by the  Judicial Com- missioners, who in fixing the price  should have regard to the fair value of the land to the owner and  to the  Estates  Commissioners.   We are of opinion  that  the exercise  of the  compulsory powers possessed by the  Estates Commissioners should,   except  in  the special  case mentioned above, be governed by the &quot;existing provisions cf the Act of  1909.
 Financial  Basis  of Sales under  the  New Act.  25. We have considered the financial basis ofthe Act of 1903 and of the Act of  1909 (see Sche-dule IV., pp. 102-4), and we do not consider thateither basis would, under the present conditionsof the money market, be suitable  for future sales.To revert to the basis of the Act of 1903, paymentin cash raised by the  issue of 2f  per cent, stock,would at present prices involve the State becom-ing responsible for  85 of excess stock  for every 100 of agreed purchase money.  On the other handwe do  not  think it would be fair  to propose thatour plan for the completion of land purchase shouldbe carried through on the basis of the Act of 1909under which a landlord, for every  100  of agreedpurchase money, receives  100 3 per cent, stockwhich  at the present  price is worth only   59-60.We have considered various proposals which havebeen made from time to time (see pp. 102-3), andare of opinion that the most hopeful solution ispayment in 5 per cent, stock at face value (see p.94).  This would involve the raising of the   teof  purchase annuities  to  5J per  cent.  Fiveshillings paid  in two  equal half-yearly  instal-ments,  if uniformly invested at 5 per cent., willsecure  the amortisation of  100 stock in  62years.   An investment of the sinking fund at auniform rate of 5 per cent, might be secured bypower being taken to  redeem at par  each halfyear an amount of 5 per cent, stock equal to theamount of the sinking fund payment,  the stockso  redeemable  to  be  determined by  periodicaldrawings.  Payment  in 5 per cent. Stock Recommended.   26. Accordingly we recommend  that the pur-chase money of all land to.be sold, after the pass-ing of a new Land Purchase Act, whether as aresult of voluntary agreement or  by means of theautomatic  process which we propose should comeinto force on the appointed day,  for all tenantedland and all untenanted land within  the  Board&apos;sarea, should be paid  in 5 per cent, stock at facevalue.  We are of opinion that the new 5 per cent.stock should be issued, and payment thereon guar-anteed, by the Imperial Government, in the sameway as guaranteed 2f per cent,  stock  and 3 percent, stock  have been issued and  guaranteed.The liability  thus imposed upon  the  ImperialExchequer  will  be  purely  nominal,  as is  itspresent liability  in respect  of the  stocks men-tioned  above,   since  payments   in  respect   ofinterest and sinking fund  should form a firstcharge  upon the Irish Consolidated  Fund.   Asis pointed  out in Schedule  II. (paragraphs 6-11,p.  99),  the loss caused  to  the State  by thenon-payment of  purchasers&apos; annuities  has beenpractically  negligible,  but  that  loss,  whateverit  may be in the future,  should be  borne  byIrish funds as it is at present.  Automatic fixation of annuities and  purchase            money of tenanted land.   27. We  are of opinion that the proposed auto-matic   transfer   of  all  tenanted  land  on  theappointed  day necessitates  the  adoption of  anautomatic  method, which is explained  below,  offixing,  first, the  annuities payable by  all tenantpurchasers  whose holdings are  vested in themwithout alteration by the  Congested  DistrictsBoard  or the Estates  Commissioners  (see para-graphs 28-9), and secondly, the  purchase money&apos;of  all  tenanted land (see paragraph  31).  AUTOMATIC  FIXING  OF  PURCHASE                ANNUITIES.              1. Judicial Rents.  28.  We are of opinion that,  in the  case ofjudicial rents, the best automatic basis is to fixthe tenant purchasers annuity at the same pro-portion of his existing rent as the annuities ofprevious tenant purchasers of  the same  classformed of their  rents.  We consider that varia-tions  in local circumstances can be most  fairlymet by applying to each case  the average reduc-tion in the  annuity as compared with the rent,not for all Ireland, but for  the county in whicheach  holding is  situate.   We  feel  ourselvesdebarred from taking  as the standard a smallerunit than the county,  partly because the countyis  the  smallest area  for  which statistics  areavailable, but mainly because an average  in  atransaction  of  this nature  can be  regarded  asfair only when  it  is the result of a large  bulkof transactions.   For the latter  reason, we havepreferred to rely on sales under the Act of 1903rather than on sales under  the Act of 1909, andto  confine our attention to such  sales as camewithin  the zones.   After this general  explanation,  we can nowstate our specific  recommendations as  to  eachclass  of judicial rents.   (a)         &quot; First Term &quot; Rents.      Each tenant whose  rent  payable at  the         date of the passing of the Act had been         fixed before 14th August, 1896, should         pay as an annuity such proportion of that         rent as former tenant purchasers,  in his         county, who  bought under the Act of         1903 (on the  basis of rents fixed before         14th August,  1896, at prices which came         within  the zones)  on the average, paid         of  their rents as annuities..  This pro-         portion for each county is given  in Table         I. of Schedule V.  (p. 105).   It is suffi-         cient to note here that  it varied  from         74.5  per  cent, in Kildare to  66.3 per         cent, in  Clare and  Kerry.   The  total        - transactions on which these figures are         based  affected  over  32,000  tenants         whose  purchase  money  exceeded  13         million pounds.  So  far  as we can as-         certain the number  of  tenants as yet         unaffected by the  Land Purchase Acts,         who  are  subject to  rents  fixed before         14th August, 1896, commonly  called         &quot; first  term &quot; rents,  is not large.   (b)       &quot; Second  Term &quot;  Rents.       Each tenant whose  rent  payable at  the         date of the passing of the Act had been         fixed after 14th August, 1896,  and be-         fore 14th  August,  1911,  should pay as         an  annuity such proportion of that rent       .  as  former tenant purchasers,  in  his         county, who  bought under the Act of         1903 (on the basis of rents fixed since         14th August,  1896, at prices which came         within  the zones)  on the average, paid         of  their rents as annuities.  This pro-         portion for each county is given  in Table         II. of Schedule V.  (p. 106).   It is suffi-         cient to note  here that  it varied  from         83&apos;6  per cent,  in  Londonderry to 74&apos;5         per cent, in Cork and-Clare.  The total         transactions on which these figures are         based  affected  over  60,000  tenants         whose  purchase  money  exceeded  22         miUion  pounds.   So  far  as  we  can
   ascertain,  most  of  the tenants as  yet   unaffected by  the Land Purchase Acts   are  subject to rents fixed in the period   14th August, 1896-14th August,  1911,   commonly called &quot;second term&quot; rents.      &quot; Third Term &quot;  Rents.The case of rents fixed since 14th August,   1911,  sometimes called &quot; third term &quot;   rents, is more  difficult.   The number   of tenants  whose rents  have been  re-   vised  in the period 1st April,  1911    31st March, 1917, is as  follows:                        No.      Average                        of    percentage of                      Cases.    reduction.fixed for a first term  4,644      ,,    second ,,   4,594      ,,    third  ,,   5,444Total14,68215-7135 9212-6No  statistics are  available as  to thereduction  obtained  on   purchase  bytenants  who bought  on  the basis  ofrents  fixed  since  14th August,  1911;but  such statistics would not have beenvery helpful, since the  bulk  of  suchtransactions has certainly not been largeenough to make the average reductionobtained  a  safe  guide.    We  are  ofopinion  that  the  reduction   in   rentobtained  by these  tenants cannot beignored that is  to  say, their purchaseannuities cannot be based  on the  rentspayable  previous to this  revision.   Onthe  other hand,  we do not think  thatsuch tenant purchasers  should obtainon   purchase such  a  large reductionfrom their rents fixed since 14th August,1911,  as  would,  under the scheme we-propose,  be  obtained  by  tenant   pur-chasers whose rents had  been fixed be-fore that date.  To give them the  samereduction would mean that, as they arenow paying, or will be paying, from  somedate subsequent  to the  14th  August,1911, on the  average, only 87-4 per  cent.of the rents they had previously  beenpaying, they would on purchase pay asannuities only from 65-1 per cent, (inCork and Clare)  to 73-1 per cent, (inLondonderry) of  their  old  rents.    Weare  of opinion that tenants who  havehad  rents fixed since 14th August, 1911,should pay  as annuities  a  larger   pro-portion than those mentioned  above.After  careful  consideration we   havedecided  to   recommend  that  the re-duction   to   be   obtained  by   suchtenants,   on   purchase,   from   theirexisting  rents  should  be  only  two-thirds  of the  reduction  obtained, onpurchase, by second  term  tenants intheir county.  The reduction that wouldunder this proposal be obtained on pur-chase,  from  rents fixed   since   14thAugust,  1911,  and  the annuities  thatwould  be payable are  shown, for  eachcounty,  in Table  III.  of  Schedule V.p. 107).   The  reduction  shown above,as obtained  from  rent revision  since1S11 viz., 12&apos;6 per cent. is, however,only  an average,  and  the  reductionsobtained in different cases showed con-siderable variation.   Consequently, weconsider that it would be well to providethat the annuity to be paid by a tenantpurchaser whose rent  has been revisedsince 1911  should in no  case be greaterthan that payable by a tenant purchaserwhose rent  had not been revised since1911  (though  it had been revised since1896) and whose rent was equal to that&apos;payable before 1911  by a tenant pur-chaser who had  obtained a  subsequentrevision.  This provision will safeguarda purchaser, who has had his rent re-vised since  1911, from paying a  largerannuity than he would have  had to payhad his rent not  been so revised.             2. Non-judicial Rents.   29.  Though  statistics are available  as  to  the average reduction obtained by non-judicial tenants in each county who  bought  under the  Act of 1903,  we do not think that these averages would, owing to  the  great  variations in  non-judicial rents, be a satisfactory basis for the  automatic fixation  of  purchase annuities.  We,  therefore, recommend that it should  be the duty  of  the Land  Commission, between  the date of the pass- ing of an  Act to give effect to  our proposals and the appointed day, to  fix judicial rents on all tenanted holdings (other than those excepted in paragraph  12  above) not now  subject  to judicial  rents;  and that each tenant  of  such  a holding  should, on purchase,  pay as an annuity the same proportion of judicial rent, thus fixed, as judicial  tenants in his  county subject to rents fixed since  14th August, 1911, are to pay of such rents under the foregoing provisions (see last para- graph, sub-head (c),  and Table III.  of Schedule V., p. 107, col. 3).   To enable this provision to be carried out, we are of opinion that all land- lords  should  be  required  to furnish before  a certain date (to be fixed by  Land  Commission rules)  a schedule  of all non-judicial  tenancies. An appeal  should lie,  as at  present,  from  the Sub-Commission Court to  the Chief Commission Court  at the instance of either  landlord  or tenant. In fixing a judicial rent for the purpose  of this paragraph due regard  should be. paid  to  any reduction given by the landlord in the past.  It should be made quite clear that the tenant con- tinues liable for his old  rent until the  appointed day, and that  the judicial rent is assessed only as  a  basis  for  the fixation  of the  purchase annuity.   We  recognise  that special provision must be made  to  meet  exceptional cases, such as that of  some  fee-farm grantees and  certain  lease- holders,  where the fixation  of  a rent  on   the agricultural value of the  land would  not form an equitable basis for  sale.   Accordingly,  we recommend that any party interested in a hold- ing subject to  a  non-judicial  rent  should have the right of requiring the case of such  a holding to be transferred from the Sub-Commission Court to the Estates  Commissioners, who  have specialfacilities  for dealing with  the exceptional cases indicated; and  that they should fix  a rent, as a basis for purchase, having regard to the interestsof all the parties concerned  and all the circum- stances of the  case.  An appeal should lie fromthe decision of  the Estates Commissioners  to theJudicial Commissioner.
 Method  of fixing Annuities on holdings retained          by Board or Commissioners.   80. We recommend that  all tenants  whose holdings are not vested in them,  but are retained for treatment  or for any  other reason  by the Congested Districts Board  or the  Estates Com- missioners,  should,  when holdings are vested  in them, pay an  annuity of 5^ per cent, on what.the  Board or  the  Commissioners  declare  to  be the  fair price  of  the holding when vested.AUTOMATIC  FIXATION  OE   PURCHASE      MONEY OF TENANTED  LAND.  31. We are of opinion that the purchase moneyto be received by  landlords for their  tenantedland, whether such land  is subsequently vestedin the tenants without alteration or not, shouldbe the  purchase  money  provided  by a     percent, annuity  equal  in  amount  to  the  rentalreduced  by the  appropriate county  percentagefor each class of rent,  as set out in paragraphs28 and 29.  The  amount  so provided  would varyper  100 of rental from  1,262 in the case mostunfavourable to  the  landlord (a  &quot; first  termrental in Clare or Kerry) to  1,592 in the casemost favourable  to  the  landlord (a  &quot; secondterm &quot;  rental  in Londonderry), or  possibly to 1,697  (in  the  case  of  a  &quot;third  term&quot;  rentalin Londonderry).*   Payment to be made in 5 per cent, stock.  32. This purchase  money  should be  paid aswe  have  already indicated (see paragraph  26),not  in cash, but  in  5 per cent, stock at facevalue.  We recognise that in the present  condi-tion of the money market this stock might standat   a slight  discount,  though  the half-yearlyredemption at par of an amount of stock equal tothe  amount of the sinking fund, which we havesuggested  (see  paragraph  25),  might  have  aslight effect in keeping up the price  of the  stock.We recommend that all charges due  to the  State,such as death duties, quit and crown rents, etc.,should be redeemable  by the  transfer of suchan  amount of  stock that the interest therefromis equal to the amount of the charge, where suchcharge is an annual charge,  and by the transferof  stock  equal at  face value to the amount  ofthe charge, where such charge is a capital charge.This provision should be of  some  assistance  tolandlords.  Thus,  under  this proposal,  quit and crown rents  could be  redeemed  at 20  years&apos; purchase instead  of 25  years&apos;  purchase,  as  at present.     Bonus required Scale recommended.  84.  Accordingly, we recommend that a cashbonus should be payable on the purchase moneyof all tenanted land, varying,  as does the bonusunder the  Act of 1909,  from  0 to 18 per cent.inversely with the number of  years&apos;  purchasethat  the   purchase  money  represents of  therental.  The scale we recommend is as follows:14^ years&apos; purchase and under   ...     ...  18 per cent.Over 14g  but not exceeding 15 years&apos; purchase, 16   ,,    15  ;, 15 J  .,  :, 16  ,, 16i  ,;    17   ..,  ,.. 17i  ,,Above 18 years&apos;purchase15i1616i1717i18141210 8 6 4Nil.         Effect on Landlords Income..  33.  We recognise, however,  that the annualincome  available for  the  landlord, under thisscheme,  which  might vary  from   63,  2s.  per 100  of  gross  &quot;first term&quot;  rental in  Clare orKerry to   79,  12s.  per   100 of gross  &quot; secondterm  &quot;  rental  in Londonderry,  or possiblv to 84,  17s.. per   100  of &quot; gross  third term &quot;rental in Londonderry,  would rarely suffice toyield an adequate income  as compared with thelandlord^ net rental.* See  Schedule V.. col.  4 of  Tables I.  and II.. and col -6        of Table III.,  and note to latter Table.The scale is adopted to meet the special circum-stances of the automatic process  recommended,but  it is substantially the scale  of  the  Act of1909 adapted  from a 3 per cent, basis to a 5 percent, basis.   So far as we can calculate, it  willaverage  15 per cent,  on  all tenanted  land ascompared with the uniform bonus  of 12 per cent.which was paid  in all cases under  the  Act of1903 and the  variable  bonus which averaged  iustover 10  per cent,  under the Act  of 1909.   Theeffect  of  the  bonus,  assuming investment  at 5per cent., would be to  raise the landlords incomeper   100 of gross rental, in the  most unfavour-able case mentioned  above,  from   63, 2s. to 74,  10s., and  in the most favourable case,from   79, 12s.   to   89, 2s., or  possibly, to 91, 12s.  in the  case  of a &quot; third term &quot; rentalin  Londonderry.    Illustrative figures for  eachcounty are given, in the Tables  to Schedule V.(see pp. 104-7).   PURCHASE  MOXEY  OF UXTEXAXTED LAXD.          1. Within the Board&apos;s  area.   35.  We have already recommended (par.  23)that all untenanted land,  not a  demesne, homefarm, plantation, or  townpark, should,  in view of  the necessity  of acquiring  such land for therelief  of congestion,  pass automatically on the appointed day from the owner to the Congested Districts Board; and, for  the purpose of settling the price,  we have  also  recommended  that all owners  of  land within  the  Board&apos;s area (other than  tenants who bought under  the Land  Pur- chase Acts) should be required to lodge with the Board,  within a certain period after the passing of the Act (to be fixed by the Land Commission in  statutory  rules), a schedule  of all their un- tenanted  land other  than that  excepted above.&quot; We now recommend that the Board should, as soon  as  possible thereafter, inspect  all  such land, and make  an  offer to the owner, setting out the estimated annual value and the proposed price.  If the proposed price be  accepted by the owner,  interest  at 5 per cent,  on the proposed price and interest at 5 per  cent, on the bonus payable thereon  should be paid  to the owner,  as from the appointed day,  until the title is finally cleared and  the  final schedule of incumbrancers  settled.  36. If  the  owner declines  to  accept  the  pro-posed price, an appeal should lie to the JudicialCommissioner,  who  in fixing the price of theland in question  should  have regard  to the fairvalue of the  land to. the owner  and  to the Con-gested Districts Board.  Pending his decision, asum equal to  the annual value as  determinedby the Board, plus 5 per cent,  on the bonuspayable  on the proposed price,  should be  paidto the owner as from  the appointed day.   From
the date of the fixation of price by  the  JudicialCommissioner until the date when the purchasemoney is paid over, there should  be payable tothe owner interest at  5 per cent, on the pricefixed by the Judicial Commissioner j)lus  interestat 5 per cent,  on the  bonus; and  any differencebetween (a) the sum actually paid to  the owneras frorn the appointed day until the fixation ofprice;  and  (b)  interest at  5 per cent,  on  theprice  fixed  by the  Judicial  Commissioner plusinterest at 5 per cent,  on the bonus for the sameperiod (he., from the appointed  day until  thefixation  of  the price)  should  be  added  to  ordeducted from  (as  the case may be) the sumpayable  to the owner.          2. Outside the Board&apos;s area.  37. As already mentioned  (par.  24)  we do notconsider it practicable  to propose  that unten-anted  land  outside  the   Board&apos;s  area shouldautomatically  pass  from  the  landlord  on  theappointed  day; but we have recommended thatthe present powers of the  Estates  Commissionersto acquire untenanted  land should be  preserved,including  their present powers  of compulsoryacquisition, and that  the powers  of the EstatesCommissioners  to  acquire  land  by  voluntaryagreement with the owners  should  be extendedfor certain purposes.  In voluntary cases the priceshould  be  fixed by  agreement   between  theEstates  Commissioners and  the owners, and incompulsory cases by the  Judicial Commissionerunder  the  existing  law,  except in the specialcase mentioned in paragraph 24, where unten-anted land is acquired  by the Estates Commis-sioners  in order to relieve  congestion on the sameestate.   In such  a  case,  the Judicial Commis-sioner   in  fixing  the   price,  failing  agreementbetween the  owner  and  the Estates Commis-sioners,  is  to  have  regard  to the fair  value ofthe  land  to   the  owner  and  to  the  EstatesCommissioners.    Scale  of Bonus on  all untenanted land.  38. We  recommend  that the  bonus to  bepayable  on untenanted  land, both within  andoutside  the Board&apos;s area, should  be  in accord -ance  with  the scale  set  out in  paragraph  34above,  and that  the  second and third clausesof the First Schedule  to  the Irish Land Act of1909 should apply.*   * These clauses are:   (2) In  cases where an estate is purchased by the EstatesCommissioners or the Congested Districts Board, and  theadvance is made  in resjaect of the estate as a whole,  theadvance  shall, for the purpose of the application of  thescale, be  apportioned between the holdings and  parcels ofland comprised in the estate in such manner as the EstatesCommissioners or the Congested Districts  Board,  as  thecase may be,  direct.  (3) In  the case of the purchase of  a  parcel  of unten-anted land, and  in any case where the amount  advancedis less than the  purchase  money, the number  of years&apos;purchase  represented by the advance  shall be  calculatedin manner prescribed by the Treasury, regard being hadin the case of untenanted  land to the fair annual valueof the land to the owner.  The Eegulations dated 15th February, 1910,  made bythe Treasury  in accordance with  the foregoing  provisionare as follows: For the purpose of the annlication of theScale in the First Schedule of  the Irish  Land Act, 1909,the number of years&apos; purchase represented by the Advanceshall be ascertained:  *  I. In the case of the purchase of a parcel of untenantedland by dividing  the amount of the purchase money  bythe amount which the Estates  Commissioners  or the Con-gested Districts Board, as the case may be. shall estimateto have been the fair annual value of such parcel to theowner at  the date of purchase.  II. In any case  where the amount advanced is  less thanthe purchase money, by dividing the amount  of the pur-chase money by the amount of the rent, or in the case ofuntenanted land  by the amount which the Estates Com-missioners shall estimate to  be its fair annual value to theowner.BONUS TO BE REGARDED AS IMPERIAL EXPENDITURE.  39.  It will be remembered that when the pay-ment  of a  bonus  was first proposed  in 1903 itwas described as &quot;a free gift to Ireland.&quot;   Ithas always  been  treated as  a  payment to  bemade  by the  tax  payers,  not of Great Britainor  Ireland,  but of Ireland and  Great Britain.In  other words, though for  an Irish  service, ithas always been regarded as an  Imperial obliga-tion.  We see no  reason why land  not yet soldshould be differentiated in this respect from landalready  sold or agreed to be  sold.  Accordingly,we recommend that  the annual  charge for  thebonus payable in  future sales should, like  thecharges  for bonus  and excess  stock in completedand pending  sales, be in the first instance paidby the Irish  Government,  bat should,  so far asGreat BritahFs share thereof is concerned,  beregarded as a contribution by the Irish Govern-ment  to Imperial expenditure.   We hold thisview all the more  strongly, inasmuch  as the costto  the  State  under  the scheme now  proposedfor completing land purchase would be consider-ably less than the cost to the State has been inthe past.   The rate of bonus payable  under  thescheme  proposed will average about 15 per cent.on the  purchase  money of  tenanted  land (seeSchedule V.,  pp.  104-7).  There is no  means ofestimating  the average  rate  of  bonus  that willbe payable on the  purchase money7 of untenantedland,  but if it be assumed that the rate will  notbe substantially different from  that  payable inrespect  of  tenanted  land,  the  annual  cost  tothe State of the bonus, if money could be bor-rowed at 5 per cent., would be less than 4/5 percent,  on  the total   amount of the  purchasemoney.   Thus, for every million pounds of pur-chase money  the  annual  cost to the  State  (ifthe bonus  averaged  15 per cent.)   would  be 7,875 under 4/5 per  cent. and if the totalpurchase money of land bought under the schemeproposed were  30,000,000,  the  annual cost tothe State  (for 62 years)  would be   236,250*.With  these figures may be contrasted  the annualcost  to  the  State for bonus and excess  stock (which does not arise under  our scheme) in re-spect  of the 75 million pounds already advancedunder the Acts 1903-9. This amounts to  753,0C0or 1 per cent., while the corresponding cost to theState in respect of the  24 million pounds  to  beadvanced  in  pending  cases  is estimated   at 580,000 per  annum, or slightly under 21  percent.Expenditure on Land Resettlement  by Estates                 Commissioners.  40.  Before leaving the question of finance,  wedesire to  draw  attention  to  the necessity  ofmaking  some provision for the expenditure thatthe  Estates Commissioners must incur on therelief of  congestion within their area  and on theresettlement  of  untenanted  land.   Under theAct of 1903 &apos;(s. 44) loss on the  resale of &quot;con-gested&quot;  estates within the meaning of  Section 6(5)  was  charged on  the parliamentary  vote  forthe Land Commission, and all other expenditureon  improvement was  met out of the  ReserveFund.   Under the  Act of 1909 all loss on resaleand improvement  expenditure was  met out  ofthe Reserve Fund, and  since  the exhaustion  ofthe latter, which occurred on the 31st May, 1910,out of the parliamentary  vote for the Land Corn-mission.   For these purposes,   75,000  was voted  tThe  difficulties in the way of arriving at a satisfactoryestimate of the probable price  of the unsold land of Irelandare  explained in Schedule I. (see  especially  paragraphs8  and 9, p. 98).
in the year 1913-14, and  30,000 is provided inthe vote tor the current year.  The total amountexpended  since 1903  by the  Estates  Commis-sioners  up to  date  on  these  purposes  was 685,000.   Of  this sum  360,000, which is lessthan I per cent, on the  total transactions of theCommissioners,  is not  recoverable  from  thetenant purchasers.  The data  available are notsufficient to enable us to say  whether a similarpercentage  on the  future  transactions  of theEstates Commissioners  would be a  sufficientprovision  to make in  respect of irrecoverableexpenditure.    What  money  may  be  requiredshould be voted by the  Irish Parliament, but itis arguable that such expenditure, within certainlimits, and also the cost of the staff of the LandCommission,  should  be  treated as  Imperialexpenditure.    A  special  recommendation  hasalready been made (see paragraph 4)  for treat-ing in this manner that part of the cost of theLand Commission which is  incurred in the col-lection  of  purchase annuities.Expenditure on Land Resettlement by Congested               Districts Board.   41. More can  be  said in  favour of treatingpart, at  least, of the  cost  of  the  CongestedDistricts Board as Imperial expenditure.   TheBoard was created with the  avowed object  of&quot;developing a backward portion of the ImperialEstate,&quot;  the  backwardness of which  is largelyattributed, whether rightly or wrongly, to neglectin the  past.  We, in this  Report, are not con-cerned with that  part of the Board&apos;s  income of 250,000  per  annum which  is devoted to pur-poses other than  land purchase, but it is worthyof serious  consideration  whether  the  amountwhich  the Board sets aside for loss on  landresettlement (over  100,000 per annum) and thecost  of administration,  so  far as land purchaseand resettlement are concerned,  should  not  beregarded  as Imperial expenditure.  If this viewbe accepted, such expenditure ought,  in the firstinstance,  to be defrayed out of the  Irish  Con solidated Eund;  but, so far  as  Great Britain&apos;s share thereof  is  concerned, should be reckoned as part payment of whatever contribution Ireland may have to make towards Imperial expenditure. Question of reservation of Congested Districts         Board and  Land  Commission.  42. In paragraph  7 we recommend that, asthe  Land  Commission  will  continue to  havecertain  discretionary powers in  respect of pend-ing cases, it should remain a &quot;reserved&quot; serviceso far as its functions in respect of these  casesare concerned; the  reason being that it  seemsnot unreasonable  that pending cases should- becompleted  under the control of the Governmentunder whose auspices  proceedings  were  insti-tuted.   The  same  reason  does not  apply  infuture sales under the scheme which we propose.Neither the  Board  nor the  Estates Commis-sioners would have any important  discretionarypower as between landlords and tenants; every-thing would  work automatically,  and it might give  rise to  great  friction  if  the  work  of  the Board  and  the Commissioners, which is nothing less  than  the resettlement of the  unsold  agri- cultural land of  Ireland,  were carried out  by,departments  which  would hot  be  under thecontrol of the Irish  Government nor responsibleto the Irish Parhament.           Reservation  not desirable.  43. We  are,  therefore,  of opinion  that theCongested Districts Board should not be reservedat all,  and that  the reservation  of  the  LandCommission should cease on the appointed day.On that  day the Land Commission would prac-tically cease to be  a judicial tribunal decidingcases between landlords on the one  hand andtenants  or  the Estates Commissioners or theCongested  Districts  Board on the  other  hand,except as  regards the  fixation  by  the JudicialCommissioner of the price of untenanted land.The fact that  the removal of the present JudicialCommissioner, as of ah other  existing judges,would presumably be reserved,  as  it was in theGovernment  of Ireland Act, to the  Crown  onan address from the Imperial Parliament, would,so far as  he is concerned,  meet  any. purposethat could be  secured by reservation of the LandCommission.  The appointment  of  any JudicialCommissioner  whom it might  be  necessary toappoint  hereafter might  be left  to  the  LordChancellor  of Ireland,  if  he becomes a non-political officer, or to the  Imperial  Government.   44. The Land Commission, after the appointedday,  and the  Congested Districts  Board,  afterthe  passing  of  the  Act,  could   therefore  bebrought  into  any scheme the Irish Parliamentmay adopt for the amalgamation and consolida-tion of Irish departments, due regard  being hadto the interest of all existing Irish officers.                Sporting Rights.   45.  We have already recommended that on  thetransfer of untenanted land  within the Board&apos;sarea the landlord should  have  the privilege ofretaining sporting rights (par 23),  and. we are ofopinion  that  the same rule  should prevail  inrespect  of untenanted land outside the Board&apos;s area.   As  regards tenanted land,  we  are  of opinion  that  rights of shooting should pass to the tenants,  the Congested  Districts Board or the Estates Commissioners, unless by agreement between landlords, on the one hand, and tenants or the Congested Districts Board or the Estates Commissioners,  on the other hand, these  rights are retained  by  the landlords.   We recognise that sporting rights are of considerable value in many districts, and that, as was  pointed out in paragraph 249 of the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Congestion (Cd. 4097, 1908), the dissipation of these rights amongst a number of small occupiers usually results  in  the partial or total loss of what might be developed into an important national asset.  We, therefore, are of opinion that the Congested  Districts  Board  and the  Estates  Commissioners  should, in the inte- rests of the tenant purchasers, promote, as far as they can,  the preservation of these rights,  and  encourage in suitable  cases  the formation of as-  sociations, and the appointment  of  trustees for  this purpose.  As  regards fishing rights, we arc  of  opinion that the landlord, where he possesses  these rights,  should have the,privilege of retain-  ing or disposing of them, together with all neces-  sary rights of access  for the purpose of fishing.  In cases where the landlord does not desire to re-  tain or dispose  of these rights,  we  recommend  that they should be  retained by  the Congested  Districts^ Board or the  Estates  Commissioners.  when they are of opinion that the  preservation of  such rights  would  conduce to national interests.
     Question of  a Perpetual Rent Charge.  46. We  have  considered the  suggestion, notinfrequently made from time to time, that a per-petual rent-charge  should  be  reserved  in favourof the State  on all holdings sold under  the  LandPurchase Acts.  It will be  remembered  that sucha proposal was embodied in the  Land  Bill of1903  as introduced into the House of Commonsbut was abandoned.  We have not examined themerits of  the proposal, since,  if we made  a re-commendation  in  favour  of a  perpetual rentcharge,  it could  apply only to the tenants whohave  not  yet purchased their  holdings, and wedo  not  consider  that it  would  be practicable,even  if it were desirable,  to  propose that one-eighth of  the landholders  of  Ireland should beput in a position  different from that occupied bythe remaining seven-eighths.  47. We  desire to express our high appreciationof the help afforded  us by our Secretary, Mr.Walter Callan.  His knowledge of the Land Actsand Land Finance  is  admirable in its range andaccuracy.  His power of doing work, his helpful -ness and his  courtesy have most materially con-tributed to the completion of  our work.

(On 31st March, 1917).  1. The following table, which has been alreadygiven in paragraph 2 of  the Report, contains par-ticulars  of the land (1)  already sold, (2)  agreedto be  sold, and  (3) not yet the  subject of pro-ceedings:               Col. 1.

Land  vested      308,833   10,202,910  5,185,712  100,208,6842. Land  agreed to be    sold          100,890   3,302,941  1,207,875   23,936,0533.

The area not yet the subject of proceedingsunder  the Land Purchase Acts (col. 2)  is  30  percent, of  the  total - agricultural area of Ireland,whilst its valuation (col. 3) is  36 per cent, of  thetotal valuation of the agricultural land of Ire-land.                              .  - -   3.  From these two factors it might be inferred that  the total problem  still to be faced is one- half  of that already completed or in process of completion, but, for reasons which appear below, it is  evident that the size  of the problem to be dealt with under the proposed scheme is not so great.   4.  The financial size of the problem (col. 4) has by some been estimated, very roughly, at 72 mil- lion pounds; but this figure is of little value, as it was arrived at merely by multiplying the annual poor  law valuation of the land unsold by 20 (the average  number of years&apos; purchase given of the poor  law valuation of the lands dealt with under the Acts 1903-9).  Neither the multiplicand nor the multiplier can be relied on.  In the first place the multiplier is quite unreliable.    On  the  one hand, it might  be larger in future cases than in past  cases, for  the land unsold includes  a much larger proportion of untenanted land than did the land  already sold; and a greater number of years&apos; purchase has always been given of the poor  law valuation of untenanted than of  tenanted land, since in the former  case the vendor has  a larger interest  in the land.   On the other hand, recent changes  in the money  market must have  the effect of  decreasing the multiplier.   When  the purchase money is  paid in stock  bearing 5  per cent, interest, the same number of  years&apos;  pur- chase cannot  be expected as when the  pur- chase money was paid in stock which  carried only 8 per cent, interest,  or when the purchase money was paid in cash and the rate of interest on trustee investments was estimated at about 3J per cent.  5. The multiplicand  is equally  unreliable, for the unsold land includes demesnes, home farms, townparks, etc., none of which must, and few of which probably will, be sold under the proposed scheme.  Moreover, it  includes a large quantity of untenanted land outside the area  of the Con- gested Districts Board,  of  which  only a portion will be sold under the  proposed  scheme.  6. It is also  difficult  to  estimate the number of  holdings  (col. 1) remaining for   sale.   The total  number of agricultural holdings in Ireland, according to the Agricultural  Statistics of 1915 is 569,426.    Of this total, 105,005  were under 1 acre.   This  class includes  labourers&apos;  cottage plots  (of which  there are over 47,00  in Ireland) and many small gardens, etc., which are outside the operations of the Land  Purchase  Acts.  Still a certain number of holdings  under 1 acre have been  sold under the Acts, and more may  be. The Land Commission cannot  give any estimate of the number of such  holdings.  Probably it is not exaggerating the size of the problem to say that at least  5,000  holdings under 1 acre  have passed or will  pass under the Land  Purchase Acts.   This would suggest that the total number of agricultural holdings that have passed or are likely  to pass under the Land  Purchase  Acts might be taken as 470,000.  This, however,  is probably an  under-estimate, for a certain num- ber of non-agricultural holdings (eg., holdings in towns and villages) have been already  sold under the Land Purchase  Acts, and  more  will  be similarly sold unless the law is changed  in thisrespect.  No estimate is  available as to the num-be of such holdings; and therefore all that  canbe said is that the total number of holdings whichhave  been sold,  or are likely to be sold,  is over470,000.   As  the  number  of  holdings already sold or agreed to be sold is just under 410,000 the nurnber rerhaining to be  sold would appear to&quot; beover 60,000.  This figure, which, in view of the                                      N
uncertainty regarding holdings under 1 acre andnon-agricultural holdings, is largely hypothetical,is liable to modification in view of the followingfact.  7.  The  term &quot; holding &quot; both in the Agricul-tural Statistics and in the Census Returns (whichare classified on a basis different from that of theAgricultural Statistics)  includes not merely hold-ings  occupied by tenant purchasers and tenants,but also demesnes, home farms, and other hold-ings  of untenanted land.  Most of these holdingswould  be  included in  the 10,444 holdings  givenin the Agricultural Statistics as above  200 acresin extent, and in the  13,472 holdings which aregiven in the Census Returns for 1911 as exceed-ing  100 valuation^  There is no means of ascer-taining how many of the large holdings in ques-tion are (1) held by tenants, (2) held by tenantpurchasers, and  (3) are untenanted.    AH thatcan be said is that, if 60,000 be the total numberof holdings (in the wider sense) as yet unaffectedby the Land Purchase Acts, the number of hold-ings  occupied by tenants, all of which will underthe proposed scheme pass either to the tenants,or the  Congested Districts Board, or the EstatesCommissioners, must  be less than 60,000,  andpossibly may not be more than 50,000.  8.  It is impossible to give even an estimate ofthe probable price of the tenanted holdings whichwill pass under the proposed scheme, the numberof which  may be roughly put at 50,000.    Theaverage valuation of the 300,000 holdings alreadyscld  was  17  and the  average price  325.   Theaverage valuation of the 100,000 holdings in pro-cess of sale is  12  and the average price   240.On the one&apos; hand the  average price of  the hold-ings  remaining to be sold may well be consider-ably greater than the  average price of the hold-ings  sold or agreed to be sold,.for the former classundoubtedly includes a very much larger propor-tion  of large  tenanted holdings  than  does thelatter.  Less than 1,300 holdings have been soldunder the Land Purchase Acts at a price exceedingthe  3,000 limit, and undoubtedly the number oflarge holdings remaining unsold, the  price of whichwould  exceed that limit, is very much greater.On the other hand, it has to be remembered thatthe purchase money of all  unsold  holdings  willbe less than was the purchase money of holdingsof a  corresponding valuation already sold becauseof the  change, already referred to, in the financialbasis;  that is, the change from cash capable of in-vestment  at rates varying from 3 per cent, to  4per cent., or stock bearing interest at 3 per cent.,to stock bearing interest at  5 per cent.   If theaverage price of the unsold holdings say 50,000-works out at the average  price of the 100,000holdings now in process of  sale ( 240), the  totalpurchase  money for the tenanted land of Irelandremaining for sale would be 12 millions.    If  itworks  out at the  average  price of the 300,000holdings  already sold  ( 325), the  total price ofthe tenanted land of Ireland to be sold  under thescheme would be slightly over 16  millions.   Inview of the size of some of the larger  tenantedholdings remaining for sale the  total price maybe considerably higher.  9.  As. regards  the untenanted land,  it  is im-possible to give any estimate of the probable pur-chase money  involved.  All  the untenanted landwithin .the Board&apos;s  area (other  than  demesne  * It is important to note that the total acreage of these13,472 large holdings exceeded four million acres and thattheir total  poor law  valuation  exceeded three millionpounds,, or nearly one-third of the total valuation of theagricultural land of  Ireland;and home farms, etc.) is to be bought under thescheme,  but even within this  limited area it isimpossible to obtain any definite estimate  of theamount  of  untenanted land or  of  its probableprice.  Outside  this area  the  amount of land tobe  bought  depends  upon  the  requirements ofthe Estates Commissioners and of the CongestedDistricts Board for  the relief  of congestion  andresettlement,  and it is impossible  to  offer  anyopinion whatever upon the  probable  purchasemoney.               SCHEDULE  II.        PURCHASERS&apos;  ANNUITIES.  1. The total  advances made for land purchasesince 1870 up  to 31st March last was 98i mil-lions.  The difference between this amount andthe  100 millions,  mentioned  in paragraph 2 ofthe Report as  the  purchase money of the landsold,  was  provided  by the purchasers in cash.Some of the advances have  been redeemed  bythe purchasers; the  annuities  payable  on the ad-vances not so redeemed amount to over 2f mil-lions.  2. Advances  made under  Acts prior  to the Actof 1891 were made  in  cash  and amounted  tonearly  10J  millions.  The  annuities  payablethereon are sufficient to pay the interest chargeand  to amortise the  sums advanced within a cer-tain period, which was for the most part  a fixedperiod of 49 years,  extended  to 79 years  wherethe purchasers  availed themselves, as most did,of three decadal reductions.  The  only financialdifficulty that arises in these cases is where pur-chasers do  not pay  their annuities punctually.Any loss so  incurred is,  where &quot; guarantee de-posits &quot; are not available, defrayed out of publicfunds provided  by  the   annual  Public  WorksLoans Act.  The total loss since  1881 has beenonly a little over  5,000,  and  the average annualloss  is practically  negligible.  3. Advances  made under the  Acts of 1891-6were made in  stock, and amounted to over  13millions.  The annuities payable thereon are suf-ficient to  pay  interest charges and redeem thestock within a period which  was not fixed  butwhich was estimated at 42  years (extended  by30 years in the case of purchasers who  availedthemselves  of  three decadal  reductions).  Theperiod of repayment has been diminished by therise  in the  rate of interest.  4. Advances  made under   the  Act of 1903,amounting  to  67  millions,  were  made for  themost&quot; part  in cash raised  mainly by the issue of2f per  cent, stock.   The  annuities payable  inthese  cases  are  sufficient to pay the interestcharge on,  and to  redeem,  an amount of stockequal at face value to the amount of the cash ad-vanced, within  a period which was  estimated at68! years but which will be  less owing  to the risein the rate of interest.  The purchasers have  noliability for the &quot; Excess Stock &quot; which  had tobe created  owing to the stock being issued at adiscount.   (See Schedule III.)  5. Advances  made under   the  Act of 1909,amounting to nearly 8 millions, were made forthe most part in 3 per cent, stock  and  the annui-ties  payable  are in these cases sufficient  to paythe interest charge on and  redeem the stock  isjsued within a period which was estimated at  65years, but  which will be less owing to  the rise inthe rate of  interest.
   6. Ignoring the  question  of Excess Stock  (as to which, see-Schedule III.), it may be said that the  purchasers&apos;  annuities  are  sufficient  to pay the charges for  interest and sinking fund arising from advances  made under the Land  Purchase Acts, 1891-1909.  Financial difficulty arises only where  purchasers  do  not  pay their  annuities punctually, and  any deficiency so  caused is met out  of  the  Guarantee   Fund,  which  (avoiding technicalities) may be  said  to consist-of  various grants,  paid into the Irish Local  Taxation Ac- count and paid  thereout to county  councils.  So far as  the  Guarantee  Fund is called  upon to make good the deficiency caused by the non-pay- ment of tenant purchasers&apos; annuities, the  Irish ratepayers have  to bear the loss.*   7. The permanent loss so caused to the Guar- antee Fund  has, however,  been  almost infini- tesimal.  On each dividend day, or  day on which payments have  to be made in respect of interest and  sinking  fund,  the  Guarantee  Fund is  in- variably called upon to  meet deficiencies  arising from tenant purchasers not having paid  their an- nuities  on the preceding gale day.   Most  of this money,  however, is requhed  to  meet  cases of unpunctuality,  not  of  absolute  failure to  pay. During  the year 1916-17 the amount of the an- nuities  pavable  under the Land Purchase Acts, 1891-1909,&quot; was  2,555,283.  At the beginning of the year the arrears amounted to  28,053, but as  32,558,216 was collected during  the year, the arrears  on 31st  March,  1917,  amounted to  only  25,120, of which over two-thirds were  collected during the next  three months.!  8.  Against the charges on the Guarantee Fund that accrue each half year in  respect of current arrears  must  be set the repayments which are being continually made in respect of old arrears. In several recent years,  the  repayments  thus made to the  Guarantee  Fund  have been  greater than the amount drawn out.  Thus, in  the  year ended 31st  March,  1916,   189,000 was  drawn out of,  and  196,000 was paid into, the Guaran- tee Fund in respect of arrears.  In  the following year the  amount drawn out was   199,949 and the amount repaid was   195,734.  9.  Each year  the  full  amount of  the annuities payable is increased in consequence of fresh ad- vances  having been  made, and by the time  land purchase is completed they  may amount  to five millions or  more,   and  consequently the  total average amount of  arrears  may well be larger than at present.  On the other hand, it must be remembered that each year a tenant purchaser^ interest in his holding grows greater, and that if, through  misfortune,  he  falls into   arrear  and  a sale  becomes  necessary, there is  available for realisation not  merely  what was   formerly  the  * A small loss may. fall upon the Guanantee Fund in consequence of unproductive balances, but this  item is trifling.  t An elaborate system exists to ensure  the speedy col- lection of arrears.   A few weeks after each gale day, a &quot; solicitor&apos;s letter&quot; is sent to  each purchaser, in arrear; if this is not sufficient, a civil bill is issued, and, if neces- sary,  a decree obtained at  Quarter Sessions. After this another  demand is made,  and then, if  necessary, the sheriff seizes the  debtor&apos;s goods.  If   there  are not sufficient&apos; goods  to satisfy the claim, or  if the  writ is returned  endorsed &quot; no goods,&quot;  the Land Commission pro- ceeds to  sell the holding, but this is not  often necessary as more  and more of the arrears come in at each  stage of the proceedings.   Like proceedings are  taken in the Superior  Courts  where the debt due is in excess of the amount  for which proceedings  may be taken in the County  Court.   It is  very rare for the  full  amountof arrears  not  to  be recovered on   the  sale  ofthe holding. &quot;Where loss is incurred, it is generally&apos; dueto the difficulty of  effecting a sale in consequence  of  localfeeling;                              *      - landlords interest (in respect  of  which the an- nuity is being paid), but also the  tenant right or occupation interest.   10. It  is of importance  in this connection to note that when  a defaulting  tenant purchaser causes a charge  to be made on  the  Guarantee Fund,  the  amount of that  charge  is deducted, ultimately, not  from  the  total  amount of the death duty  grant,  or other item in  the Local Taxation Account, available for the whole of Ire- land but from that share of the grant which  is payable to the county in  which  the  holding of the defaulting tenant is situate.   This narrow ing down of the  area responsible  for the  loss caused by a  purchaser&apos;s default  is1 said to have an excellent  effect in moulding  public  opinion against defaulters,  and,  in  accordance with the wish of the  county councils, the Land Commis- sion  now  communicates  to the  councils  the names of defaulters in each county,  so that local public opinion may be directed against them.   11. Any loss arising from  the non-payment of annuities thus falls, under the present law, upon Irish funds, except in the case  of advances made under Acts prior to 1891, and,  as has  been seen, the loss in these  cases is practically negligible.   12. In  both the Home Rule Bill  of 1893  and the Government of Ireland Act, 1914, it was pio- vided that the liability  which now attaches to the Guarantee Fund  should attach  to the Irish Consolidated  Fund;  that is,  that  Irish  funds should have to make  good,  as they do now,  any loss caused by non-payment of purchase annui- ties.   The financial provisions  of both measures were so arranged that the revenue  put  within the control of the  Irish  Government  included  the sums now payable into the  Irish- Local Taxation Account which go to  form  the&apos;Guarantee  Fund. It  rested  with the Irish Parliament  to decide whether they would continue to  pay out of the Irish  revenue to  the  Irish  Local  Government Councils annual sums  similar to those now pay- able  out of the Local  Taxation  Account, or whe- ther  they  would  make other arrangements.  It was also within the province of  the Irish Govern - ment to decide whether they would continue the system referred  to above,  under  which  these grants  in relief of rates have  to bear the loss caused by default, and whether they would con- tinue the arrangement under which the area of responsibility is  so narrowed  down  that  each county suffers the loss incurred by the default of purchaseis of  holdings in that county.   13. No objection was taken  in  Parliament to the Irish Consolidated Fund assuming this  lia- bility  for loss caused  by non-payment  of pur- chase annuities.   In respect of future advances objection  could reasonably  be  taken to such&apos; a course  only  if a  reckless policy  of sanctioning advances  beyond  the  value  of  holdings were&apos; to be  adopted by some authority not under the con- trol of the Irish Government.   14.  Under the Bill of 1893 and the Act of 1914, whilst the Irish Government would have to bear any loss  incurred  by  the non-payment  of pur- chasers&apos; annuities, it  was the Imperial and not the Irish Government that was  to  continue to collect these  annuities.   This  division of func- tions, which arose  from treating the administra- tion of the Land Purchase Acts  as a reserved ser- vice,  seems undesirable.  Any remissness on the part  of the Imperial  Government in  collecting annuities would involve not that Government but the Irish Government  in, at  any rate, temporaryloss  Moreover, the policy of leaving the  cblleo-                                    N2
tion of purchase annuities in Ireland to the Tm-perial Government, which must have recourse toIrish  Courts  and Irish  officials for the enforce-ment  of their claims, seems  to  involve an  un-necessary case of  concurrent  jurisdictions.  15.  The Bills of 1886 and 1893 and the Act of1914 show some variance in the treatment pro-posed for loss caused by non-payment of annui-ties due for land purchase prior to 1891.  As hasbeen seen, this loss now falls not on the Guaran-tee Fund but on funds common  to  the UnitedKingdom.  The  loss  is,  however,  practicallynegligible and the Irish Government might wellundertake  all  liability  connected  with  theseannuities.              SCHEDULE  III.       EXCESS STOCK AND BONUS.           PART I.  COMPLETED CASES.                 Excess Stock.  1. Under the  Act of 1903, the cash requiredfor  advances was  raised by the issue of  2f percent,  stock.  The  tenants&apos; annuities were at therate of  3 5s. Od.  ( 2 15s. Od. being for interestand 10/- for sinking fund) for every  100  cashadvanced-.  If stock had  always  been issued atpar, the tenants&apos;  annuities would have sufficedto discharge  the liabilities on the stock  issued.Stock, however,  could  never be issued at par,and in order to obtain  100 cash it has been neces-sary to  issue, on the average, over  115 Stock.*As  a purchasers&apos;  annuity sufficed  to  provideinterest and  sinking fund on only  100  of this 115  stock, the  interest and sinking fund on thebalance, which  is  known as  &quot; Excess Stock,&quot;was, under Sect. 36 (6)  of the Act of 1903, madepayable out of the Guarantee Fund.   For thepurpose of this  charge the grant, known as the&quot; Ireland Development  Grant &quot;  formed the firstitem  of the Guarantee Fund.  2. The  history  of the Ireland DevelopmentGrant may be  recalled.   In 1902, when  newgrants for education were made  payable in Eng-land and Wales, a corresponding grant  for Scot-land was included in the Scottish Education vote,and a pledge was given to make an equivalentannual grant in  Ireland.  In the following year,by  3 Edward VII., c. 23, this grant  was fixed at 185,000 per annum, and it was enacted that somuch of the grant as was not required for pur-noses connected with Land Purchase under theIrish  Land Act  of 1903 should  be paid into  anaccount called the Ireland Development Grantand  devoted  to  education,   the  promotion  ofeconomic development and transit facilities.  TheIrish  Land Act of 1903  (sects. 38-9), made provi-sion for the payment, out of this grant, of  20,000a vear  to the Congested Districts  Board,  and 5,000  a  year to Trinity College.   The balanceof  the grant went into the cash portion of theGuarantee Fund, but so far as it was not wantedto meet charges on that Fund, it was to be de-voted to  the purposes  already  specified,  viz.,education  and the  promotion of economic de-velopment  and -  transit   facilities.   A   certainamount was so  expended, but owing to  the  in-  *  At the present  moment  it would be necessary toissue nearly  185 of 2f per  cent. Stock in order to obtain 100 cash.creasing  charge on it, as the first item  in theGuarantee Fund liable for charges arising out ofExcess Stock,  the  amount  available for  educa-tion and  economic purposes  grew steadily  less.  3. In 1909 the annual charge on the GuaranteeFund in  respect  of Excess  Stock amounted  toover  100,000 per annum, and it was calculatedthat, at the then market value of the stock, thecharge would rise to  750,000 per annum beforeLand Purchase was completed.   Such a  chargeon  the Guarantee  Fund would  have swallowedup  not only the whole  of  the  balance  of theLeland Development Grant, the first item,  forthis purpose,  in the  cash portion of the Guar-antee Fund, but also the  whole of the  seconditem, the  Death Duty Grant, and  half  of thethird item, the Agricultural  Grant, and so wouldhave dislocated the finance of  the  county anddistrict  councils  throughout Ireland.    It  wastherefore provided by the Irish Land Act, 1909,Sect. 7, that,  once  the  160,000 available out ofthe Ireland Development Grant  was exhausted,any further deficiency in respect of Excess Stockshould be  made good not out. of the GuaranteeFund but out of money voted by Parliaments  4. The   160,000 available, out of the IrelandDevelopment Grant became fully hypothecated in1910, and  the  sums necessary to meet the fur-ther loss on Excess Stock have since been votedas part of the cost of the Irish  Land Commis-sion.  The  sum voted under this  head  in theyear ended 31st March, 1917,  was  280,000,and the  sum actually paid out was  267,740,in addition to the  160,000 a year available outof the  Ireland  Development Grant.  5. The question of Excess Stock does not asa  general  rule arise  in the  case of advancesmade under the Act of 1909, that is, in the caseof agreements  entered into  after the 15th Sep-tember, 1909, as they are financed on a differentbasis,  namely, by  the payment to vendors  ofthe  new  3 per cent.  Stock at  its  face  value.Land,  however, bought  by the  Congested Dis-tricts Board or the Estate Commissioners, com-pulsorily or under  a  final offer,  has to be paidfor in  cash, and this  may  involve the issue  ofExcess Stock,  the  charge for which would fallupon the  parliamentary vote for the Land Corn-mission.  6. Two  points may be noted which  have abearing on Excess  Stock.  In  the first  place,the  duration of the purchasers&apos;  annuities is notfixed:  they are to  continue until the accumula-tion of the sinking fund of 10s. per year (pay-able in two half-yearly instalments) per.  100advanced is sufficient to amortise the debt.  Theduration  of the  annuity consequently  dependson  the rate of interest  earned by  the  sinkingfund.  If  this were  a  uniform rate of 2f percent, (the rate of interest payable  on the stockby which  purchases under  the Act  of 1903  arefinanced)  the annuities would  run for 68J years;if the  rate were a uniform one of  3 per cent.(the rate  of interest payable on the stock  bywhich  purchases  under the  Act  of  1909  arefinanced)  the  annuities would run for 65  years;if the rate were a uniform rate of 5 per cent, (therate of interest yielded by investment in  2f percent, stock and  3 per  cent, stock at  present  * The charge for unearned or bonus dividend, whichuntil 1909 was met out of the Guarantee  Fund, is nowdefrayed in the same way as the  charge for Excess Stock.Ai the unearned or bonus dividend is really a device toincrease the attractiveness of the Stock, this  treatmentas part of  the cost of flotation  seems appropriate.
 prices)  the annuities  would run  for 48   years. The  actual rate  allowed  is  fixed by Treasury rules at 2f per cent,  in  the case  of annuities under the Act  of 1903,  and at  3 per  cent,  in the case of annuities under the Act of 1909. These rates are liable to variation in accordance with the rates  of interest actually  obtained by the National  Debt Commissioners.    The rates so  far earned are practically tbose fixed by the Treasury rules,  since the sinking  fund payments are utilised for  the purpose of making fresh ad- vances.  The  sinking fund payments now amount to  a total of nearly \ million pounds per annum which is increasing, and  the utilisation of  this increasing  sum  for the purpose of making fresh advances  thus  reduces   (by  its amount)  the amount  of cash that  has  to be annually  raised by the issue of stock.   Consequently, the annual charge for Excess Stock is less  than it would be if the sinking  fund were not utilised in the man- ner mentioned.     Once land purchase  is com- pleted sinking fund  payments  will  cease  to be so  utilised,  and  can be invested at  higher rates than 2f per cent, and 3  per cent, (unless the money  market  completely changes)  and  conse- quently  the annuities will cease in  less than 68J years and 65  years respectively.   7. The second point  to be noted in connection with Excess Stock is  that  the charge  therefor has been considerably  less than it would  other- wise  have  been had not many vendors availed themselves  of the option given  in the Act  of 1909 of  securing  special  priority by accepting payment in 2f  per cent,  stock or half in cash and half in stock instead  of  all cash.  The ad- vances thus effected amounted to over 14 mil- lions.  The stock  so taken was  at the minimum price of  92.  These arrangements reduced con- siderably the  amount  of Excess Stock that  had to be created.                  ,  Bonus.  8. A cash bonus of twelve million pounds was provided in the 1903  Act for  the purpose of bridging the gulf between the price tenants were willing to pay and the price at which landlords were willing to  sell.  On  the assumption that 100 millions  would  be sufficient, to  complete land purchase, this bonus was payable under the statute  at  the rate of  twelve per cent, on  the purchase money advanced, such rate to be con- tinued for  a period of five years.  On  the  ex- piration of that  period (1st November, 1908)  it was. found that 100 millions would not suffice to complete land purchase,  and the Treasury,  in accordance with their statutory power, reduced the percentage from  twelve to  three per  cent.,&apos; at which rate it would have remained for at least five years,  had  not a new Act been  passed in 1909.  This Act  removed the twelve million limit and provided  for  the  payment of a  graduated bonus at rates ranging from 0 to 18 per  cent., varying inversely with the  number of years&apos; pur-&quot; chase of the rent.  The average  rate of bonus paid since 1909  has been just over 10 per cent. It was calculated  some years ago  that the capi- tal  sum payable  as bonus under existing arrange-ments would,  before Land Purchase was  com-pleted, amount  to  at least 15 millions to pro- vide which, at the then price of stock, it wouldbe necessary to issue over 17 millions stock, and,in the present condition of the money market,this  sum   must   be  exceeded.     Roughly speaking, about  10 millions worth of  stock has already  been  issued  to  provide bonus,  and  335,000  was voted  in  the year ended 31stMarch,  1917, to pay  the interest and sinkingfund on this stock.  Of this sum  324,659 wasactually required in the year ended 31st Marchlast to make the payments necessary in respectof bonus.       Annual Cost of  Completed Cases.  9. The  total charges  in  the  year  1916-7 forthe annual  payments  necessary for the ExcessStock and for the stock issued to provide a cashbonus in respect  of the 75 million pounds worthof land sold since 1903 up to  the 31st Marchlast were:   (a) For Excess Stock      payable  out of  the      Ireland Development      Grant    ...      ...  160,000      payable out of Land      Commission Vote ...   268,000                         -   428,000  (b) For Bonus payable out of the      Land Commission Vote     ...    325,000                                       753,000 These sums are at present paid out of the par- liamentary votes, but are classified in the Trea- sury Returns as Irish  expenditure and included in  the  12\ millions shown as the cost of Irish Government.   It will be noted that the  annual cost to the State of Excess Stock  and Bonus  in completed cases is  1 per cent, on the total ad- vance.*           PART. II.  PENDING CASES.                 Excess Stock.  10. About three-quarters of  the pending cases come under the Act of  1903, and so require pay- ment in cash.   Such payment would involve the issue of Excess Stock,  as  described above, ex- cept so far as the vendors have agreed to  accept payment wholly or partly in  stock.   Moreover, in a certain number of the pending cases under the  Act of 1909  payment  in  cash is required. As  nearly as can  be  judged about 19 millions cash will have to be raised in  order to complete pending  cases. . After making  allowance for the utilisation  of sinking fund payments during the next three years, this would seem to involve, at present prices,  the  issue of a large  amount of Excess  Stock, the exact amount of which  would vary  according  as  the  cash was  raised by the issue of  2f per cent, or 3 per cent.  Stock, but the annual charge for  which  would, at present prices, be certainly not less than  440,000. -&apos;                    Bonus.  11. As1 regards the land which landlords have agreed to sell for 3 per cent, stock, the total pur- chase money of which is under five millions, the State is  not  under the  existing law involved in loss, except in respect of bonus.   On  the  whole twenty-four millions that represent the price of pending  cases, bonus has to  be paid.  At thepresent average rate of bonus (10 per cent.),this  would amount to   2,400,000 cash, and toraise this sum  would involve, at present&apos; prices,an annual  charge for interest  and  sinking fundof over   140,000.  * Liability for Excess Stock does  not arise where ad- vances are made in Stock under the Act of 1909.

  Annual Cost of completion of pending cases.-1-2.-Consequently  the completion  of  pendingcases would involve  a charge to . the State forexcess stock and bonus which cannot, at presentprices, be  put at less than  580,000 a year, ornearly 2J per cent,  per annum on the amount ofthe advances.     : PART III:   NATURE OF CHARGE FOR           EXCESS STOCK AND BONUS.  13. The  actual annual charge for Excess Stockand  Bonus in completed cases is  753,000,  andthe same charge for  pending  cases  is estimatedat not less than  580,000,  making a total of 1,333,000.  The bonus was always regarded as&quot;a free gift to Ireland,&quot; that is, it was to be paid,not  by the  tax-payers of Great Britain  or ofIreland,  but  of the  United Kingdom as a whole;and  the.  charge for Excess Stock was similarlytreated in 1909. Though  160,000 a year of thatcharge is met out  of the  Ireland DevelopmentGrant, there is no difference in principle betweenthat portion of the  change and the balance.  Asalready  mentioned,  the whole   cost of ExcessStock, and Bonus is included in the 12iJ millionsshown in the Treasury Returns as the cost  of theIrish Government.  It is certainly an Irish  ser-vice  but  an Imperial  obligation.              SCHEDULE IV.METHOD OE FINANCING FUTURE SALES.  1. The  method adopted in 1903, under whichlandlords were to be paid in cash, to be raised bythe- issue  of 2f per cent,  stock, broke down be-causef  owing to the increasing discount at whichthat stock had to be  issued, the cost in respectof Excess  Stock became very heavy.  To revertto that system would now be impossible.   Thisdiscount&apos;is at present nearly 46 per cent.   Con-sequently,  at the existing  prices, the State wouldhave to pay an annual sum for Excess Stock notfar  short of the purchasers&apos; annuities.&apos;  2. In   1909   the   Land  Commission    wasauthorised in future cases to revert to paymentin&apos; stock (3 per  cent.)  at its face value.   Thischange  in  the stock necessitated an  increase inthe purchasers&apos; annuities from 3J to 3^ per cent.,and this increase, to  a certain  extent,  checkedland purchase,  since  tenants could not,  withoutincreasing the amount of their annuities give thesame number of years&apos;  purchase as they didunder  the  Act of 1903. -  The real reason,  how-ever, why purchase was  notably checked underthe Act of 1909 was  that the 3 per  cent,  stockwas never megotiable except at a  considerablediscount,  which : vendors  feared &apos; would  becomeincreased  before they received payment; and.theineiease in that discount, which is now 41 percent.,  has naturally stopped all proceedings.&quot; 3.&quot;Some change  in finance seems necessary ifland  purchase is  to  be  speedily completed onequitable  terms.  ...  TREASURY.INQUIRY INTO FINANCE OF LAND          -         -PURCHASE.  4. It will be  remembered that a small  Com-mittee. was. appointed by the Chancellor of theExchequer at the end of  1907 to inquire into thedifficulties which, owing to the price of 2f per cent  stock, had arisen in the financing of  the Irish Land Act of 1903.  In the Report (Cd. 4005 of 1908) the Committee examined the different remedies proposed:    (1)  Issue of consols  instead of stock.  (Pre-         sent price of consols, 56).   (2)  The utilisation of the Sinking Fund of  the         National Debt.   The objections to these schemes were pointed out in the Treasury Report.   It is sufficient here to say that the present conditions of the national credit seem to put their adoption out of question at present.   (3)  The extension of the period for repayment.   No period was fixed in the Act for the duration of purchasers&apos; annuities, but if the sinking fund was uniformly invested in 2f  per cent,  stock,  the annuities would  run for 68f years.  As the sink- ing  fund payments could in  1908 have been  in- vested at over 3 per cent, (at present they could be invested at 5 per cent.), it was suggested to the  Treasury Committee  that  the  annuities should run for a fixed period of 68J years,, and that the increased rate of accumulation  should. be utilised to relieve the charge for Excess Stock. It was,  however, pointed out  that it  would.be hardly equitable to make this change  as regards advances already made or applied for.  The ten- ant  purchasers had,  at  least,  an  equitable right to any  shortening of the period of repayment produced by the  rise in the rate of interest, espe- cially  as they would have had to bear any pro- longation of the period of repayment produced by any fall in the rate of interest.  As a matter of fact, as has been already pointed out  (see Sche- dule III., paragraph 6), sinking fund  payments are  utilised in making fresh advances which  en- sure a uniform accumulation at 2f per cent,  in- terest  in cases under the Act of  1903 and at 3 per  cent, in cases  under the  Act  of 1909.  This rate of  accumulation will presumably  continue until all advances under the Acts  of 1903-9 have been made, after  which the  sinking  fund will accumulate at a  higher rate  of interest.  A defi- nite prolongation  of  the  period  of repayment could be effected in the case of future sales, but it would not  help  matters  much.   (4) A reduction of the Sinking Fund  from 10s.         to 5s. per  100 and an increase in the         rate of interest from 2f per cent, to 3 per         cent,  (the total annuity thus remaining         the same).   The same objection, in principle, noted against the  last suggestion, applied to this suggestion in respect of advances already made or to be made in pending cases, viz., that it involved  an altera- tion of the statutory terms on which advances had been made.  As  regards future cases, it was con- sidered that the  reduction of  the sinking fund to J per  cent.,  would,  whilst the rate of  interest remained at 3 per cent., involve  an undue pro- longation of the  period of repayment.    As a  re- sult, however,  of  the increase- in  the  rate  of interest  that  sinking  fund  payments  can. earn, the  reduction of  the sinking fund to 5s. per cent. is now quite feasible.   (See paragraph  25 of Re- port, p. 92).   (5)  Redeeming the reversion of the  Lish De-         velopment Grant.   This,  at  best,  would have  afforded  trifling  re- lief and was open  to objections.   5. The Treasury Committee recommended  the limitation of the amount of cash to be advanced
for pending cases to the amount of cash that theNational Debt Commissioners might be in a posi-tiqn;to lend from time to time.  This suggestion was not adopted, and does notseem feasible at the present moment.  6.&apos;,.The  Treasury  Committee  also  suggestedthat the landlords should, in cases then pending,be given the option of taking stock at the marketprice of the day  (not lower than  92) in lieu ofcash or in lieu of half the cash, the inducementto-do so being priority.  This suggestion was adopted in the Act of 1909and  has been availed of to a limited extent  (seeSchedule III., paragraph  7).*   The effect of thisexpedient has been to reduce the loss on ExcessStock (see  Schedule III., par. 7, p. 101). . 7.  As regards future advances it was suggestedby the  Treasury  Committee that money shouldbe provided by the issue of 3 per cent, stock. Ifthe  stock could not be  issued at par,  cash ad-van ces were to cease, but landlords were to havethe option taking the  stock at its face value.  The method adopted  by Parliament  in 1909was  payment in 3 per cent stock at its face value,but,, as  has  already  been noted  (paragraph 2above) the prospect of receiving payment  in de-preciated  stock,  liable to further depreciation,checked land purchase,  which is  now  entirelystopped by the low price of the stock.         PRESENT, FINANCIAL PROBLEM.  8.  The fundamental facts of the situation arethat money cannot now be borrowed at less than5 per cent., if at so low a rate,  and that, on theother hand, owing to the  rise in the  rate ofinterest, a 5s. per cent, sinking fund will amortisea loan as quickly as  would a  10s. sinking fundwhen the rate of interest to be earned was  only 3per  cent.   If  advances  are made in cash,  and ifthe purchase annuity is to be sufficient to meet allthe charges for the money so advanced, the rateof the purchase annuity cannot be less than  5J percent, if so low.  Unless the purchaser has  to payas an annuity a-greater percentage of his formerrent than annuities have averaged during the lastfifteen years,  which was under 75 per cent, ofthe rent, the advance cannot be more than four-teen times the rent,  and many landlords couldnot  afford  to sell at fourteen  years&apos;  purchase,even though the proceeds were invested at 5 percent.  9.  It may be that under a  voluntary  systemthe  realisation of the fact that the condition ofthe  money  market precludes  any return  to theland purchase terms  of  1903,  except at  an im-mense loss to the State,  might now make land-lords more ready than formerly to accept termsinvolving  a diminution of income  as  comparedwith net rental, and might also operate to inducetenants to  demand a  less reduction in their pur-chase money, as  compared with then rent, thanwas  formerly  the case;  but it  seems  inevitablethat the State must do something to bridge thegulf  that  will still exist  between the terms atwhich landlords are willing to sell and those atwhich tenants .are willing to buy.  10. Three schemes  have been suggested:   1.  The first is that  landlords should be paid in5 per cent, stock,  and  that all charges,  mort-gages,  etc., should be discharged by the transferof this  stock at its face value.   The latter part  * The important change made by the  Act as  regardscases then pending,  was, as has been already noted, theremoval  of  the liability&apos; for Excess Stock  from theGuarantee Fund to the parliamentary vote for the LandCommission.   (See Schedule III., par. 3, p. 100)of this proposal would  be helpful to  landlordsonly  when  such stock was at a discount,  andmight be thought unfair  to chargeants.&apos;  The tenant purchasers annuity could not beless than 5J per cent.  (5 per cent, interest and Jper cent sinking fund).  If the sinking fund wereuniformily invested at 5 per cent, interest, thestock could be redeemed in 62 years.   A uniforminvestment at 5 per cent,  could be  secured byprovision  being  made  for the redemption at parevery year  of an- amount of stock equal to theamount of the annual sinking fund payment, thestock so  redeemable  being determined by lot.Such annual redemption would probably have a-slight effect on keeping up the  price of the stock.   Unless  the annuity to be paid by the tenantpurchaser is to be a greater proportion of his rentthan  it has averaged  heretofore, i.e.,  less than75 per cent, in all sales under the Act of 1903, theannuity at 5J per cent, could not provide on theaverage quite 14 years&apos; purchase of his rent.  Theinterest at  5  per cent,  on the amount of  stockthus  provided would in  many  cases be  consider-ably  less  than the landlords net rental. ,  Thisloss might, however,  be diminished,  if not  en-tirely removed,  by the payment by the  State of asuitable bonus.   One merit of this scheme is that it recognisesthe  existing facts  of the money market, except that  the  rate  of  interest on Government  stockis tending to rise above  5 per  cent.  . From anyrise over the rate of 5 per cent, neither the  Statenor the tenants would suffer; the landlords wouldsuffer,  from  the  consequent  depreciation  of 5per  cent,  stock, so far  as  it  was necessary  torealise stock for the payment of charges.   Thisscheme recognises quite frankly the necessity of State aid in the shape of a bonus,  and there isno partially hidden liabilitv in the shape of Excess Stock.   2.  The second suggestion is that the landlordshould be paid in cash  which the Governmentshould borrow as cheaply as they could, and forwhich the tenant should be charged at the rateof only 4i per cent., his  annuity being at the rateof 4f per cent.   Under this scheme the tenanfsannuity (on the assumption that he would receivethe average reduction of the past) would provideless than 16 years&apos; purchase of his rent.   This scheme  would to some extent follow theAct of 1903, inasmuch as advances would be madein  cash,  and  landlords  and  tenants  would bebrought together  by the  State  lending  cashcheaper than it could borrow it (which,  under theAct  of 1903,  involved  the creation  of excessstock). Apart from the bonus, if any were pay-able, the State would, in the present conditionof the money market, lose at least i per cent,  ininterest per annum on every  100 cash advanced.Moreover, the loss to  the State would not,  as inthe last scheme, be clear and definite, but wouldincrease  with  every  increase in the rate  ofinterest.  3.  The third suggestion is that landlords shouldbe paid their  purchase money half in  cash andhalf in  3  per cent. Stock at its face value, andshould receive no bonus.  This scheme was de-signed to  avoid  any unnecessary departure  fromthe existing finance of land purchase, especiallyfrom  the rate of the annuity which  would con-tinue  at the present  figure, 3i per  cent.   Thesuggestion  that  the  landlord  should   be  paidpartly in  cash and partly  in  stock follows thesuggestion made by the  Treasury Committee of1907  and  the option given in  the Act  of 1909.It aims at removing the chief difficulty  that con-
fronts a vendor who is paid in a stock standingat a large discount, viz., the difficulty of raisingcash  to pay off charges.  Under this  scheme  State  aid takes the formof providing cash for  half the purchase  moneyat 3J per cent, instead of  at the  current rate.To  put it  in  another way,  for  every  100  ofpurchase money the landlord would receive  50in 3J per cent, stock and  50 in cash.  To raisethe  latter,  the State  would have  to  issue  78stock,  assuming that  3J per cent, stock wouldstand at 04, the figure indicated by present rates.As the  tenanfs annuity at 3J per cent, wouldpay the interest and sinking fund on only  100stock, the State would, in respect of every  100of purchase money, have to bear the interest andsinking  fund on  28 stock.   This scheme wouldbe the most costly for the State, and the cost,as in the second case, would be liable to increasewith each increase in the rate of interest.               SCHEDULE V.FINANCIAL   EFFECT   OF   PROPOSALS  RECOMMENDED BY SUB-COMMITTEE.The following tables show for each county:   (I.) In the  case of &quot; first term &quot; rents, i.e.,      rents fixed prior  to 14th August, 1896:  (II.) In  the case  of  &quot; second  term &quot; rents,      i.e.,  rents  fixed  between  14th August,      1896, and 14th August, 1911:  (III.) In the case of &quot; third term &quot; rents, i.e.,      rents fixed after 14th August, 1911:    1. The  percentage of his rent that will be          payable by each  purchaser as an an-          nuity  under  the automatic  systein          proposed;    2. The number of years&apos; purchase of the rent          that will be provided by each tenant          purchasers  annuity;    3. The  rate of bonus that will be payable          under the scale recommended;    4. The  purchase money receivable  by  land-          lords in 5 per cent, stock per  100 of          rental;    5. The  amount  of the  bonus per  100 of          rental;    6. The  total income receivable by landlords          from the purchase  money  and the          bonus  (at  5 per  cent.) per  100 of          rental.  It will be noted that the rate of bonus payableis 18 per cent, in each county in the case of &apos;&apos; firstterm &quot; rents; 18 per cent,  in 7 counties, 16 percent,  in  13  counties, 14 per cent, in 8 counties,and  12 per cent,  in 5  counties in the case of&quot;second term&quot;  rents;  and 12 per  cent, in 4counties, 10 per cent, in 21 counties, and 8 percent,  in 8 counties in the case of &quot; third term &quot;rents..  It will be noted that in each table the countiesare given in. the descending order of the total in-come receivable by landlords; and that, in  somecases, the effect of the bonus is to give the land-lord in one  county a larger income than the  land-lord in another county, though a larger numberof years&apos; purchase is  given  in the latter countythan in the former.    This  result, if consideredobjectionable, could be avoided only  by graduat-ing the bonus,  not according to the  number ofyears&apos; or half-years&apos; purchase given, but accord-ing to much smaller fractions.

It has to be  remembered that the percentage of a &quot; third term &quot; rent pa3^able as anannuity (Col. 3) is the maximum payable, since a purchaser liable for a &quot; third term &quot; rent is in nocase to pay a larger annuity than he would have had to pay if he had not had his rent revised since14th August, 1911; that is, if his purchase had been based on a second term rent, and not on a thirdterm rent (see Report, end of paragraph 28).   Thus a purchaser in County Londonderry whose renthas been revised since 14th August, 1911, will pay whichever of these two sums be the smaller, viz. :89-1 per cent, of that revised rent  (Table III. col. 3) or 83-6 of the rent payable previous to thatrevision (Table II. col. 1).   Hence the purchase money and the income receivable by the landlordmay be less than that shown in cols.  6 and 8.                                                                                   02

STATEMENT  SHOWING THE DECISIONS  OF  THE  CONVENTION UPON THE REPORT                OF  THE   SUB-COMMITTEE  ON  DEFENCE  AND  POLICE.                                         (LC.  No. 30.)  The  Convention considered  and voted  on theReport (see  pp. 117-35)  in  five  sections  asfollows : I.  The prefirninary matter and the  two para-       graphs entitled &quot; Naval Defence.&quot;   These       paragraphs were as follows :                NAVAL DEFENCE.  In  regard  to Naval defence, the Committeeaccept unreservedly the Adimrah&quot;y&apos;s view that forthis purpose  Ireland  must  be  considered  asintegrally  connected with  Great  Britain,  anddefence must, therefore, be by one force underone control.   It seems to us unnecessary to go  into the detailsdiscussed in the Admiralty&apos;s Memorandum exceptto  say that in our opinion some  of the  matterstouched on might well be the subject of agreementbetween  the Imperial and Irish Governments.           Adopted.II. The   section  entitled  &quot; Military   Defence &quot;       which was as follows :               MILITARY DEFENCE.   In regard  to  the  military problens,  the  Com- mittee assume that  under any scheme of military defence  the historical Irish regiments  will be  a part of the regular army, that Ireland will be, as it  has been in  the past, a  valuable  recruiting ground,  and that the facilities which it offers for training  troops of all arms will  continue  to  be largely utilised  with the general approval of the Irish pubhc.   The question of raising a local Territorial Force necessarily engaged our attention,  and Major- General  Sir Charles Callwell was deputed by the War  Office,  in  a  letter dated December 19th, 1917,  to give us assistance on the military matters involved.   The creation of an  Irish Defence Force of the territorial type must be considered in relation to the general scheme of defence of the British Isles.   It is impossible, as we think, for the Convention to formulate  at present either in principle or in detail any scheme for the estabhshment of such a Force.   That question must  largely depend on the  corresponding  conditions  in England  and Scotland. We, therefore, submit  the following as our conclusions upon  the  question of  an  Irish Defence  Force :      (1).  That at some  time  it is desirable that           Ireland should provide a local force to           serve in Ireland during peace, and in           any part of the United Kingdom during           war.     (2).  That we believe Ireland could  contribute,           having regard to its  population  and           social conditions,  a sufficient number           of  men to  maintain  two  complete           divisions.    (3). That the character of  the organisation          and conditions  of sendee cannot  be          determined until the character of Home          Defence Forces after the war is decided,          a matter  which,  as  we  are  advised,          will be uncertain untd after the war,          and will  depend  on  the character of          the peace and  other circumstances.    (4). That  when  tins  matter  comes  under          consideration, the strength and organi-          sation  of the  Irish  Force,  and  its          conditions of service should be reported          on by  a  Joint  Committee on Defence          consisting of members of the Imperial          Government and the Irish Government          with military  advisers nominated  by          then;, and that the whole matter should          bo decided between  the  two Govem-          ments.    (5). That any such force, if raised and paid          by  the Irish Government, should be          reckoned  as part of the contribution          made by Ireland to common Imperial          expenses.    (6). That in time of war or imminence of war          all military forces and organisations in          the United Kingdom must pass under          the absolute control  of  the Imperial          Authorities.Amendment proposed (COLONEL  WALLACE) :   To  omit the whole Section and substitute  thefollowing :       &quot; The  question of the mifitaiy defence of    Ireland is a matter exclusively for the Imperial    Government.&quot;          Amendment rejected by 49 votes to  22.               (See Division List No. 14).Amendment proposed (SIR WILLIAM GOULDING) :       To omit all the words after &quot; war &quot; at the    end of Sub-section (1).          Amendment rejected.    Section adopted by 38 votes to 23.  (See Division        List No. 15).III. The section  entitled  &quot; The question of Con-      scription,&quot; which was as follows :         THE QUESTION OF CONSCRIPTION.  We have ahead)&apos; submitted an Literim Report,which it  will be convenient to reproduce here, onthe practical aspect of Conscription in the eventof the estabhshment of a separate Irish Parliamentand Executive.   The report was as follows                          &quot; 29th November, 1917.       &quot; Assuming that a scheme  of self-govern-    ment for Ireland be  adopted,  including  the    estabhshment of an Irish Parliament  and an    Irish  Executive  Government  responsible    thereto,  we  think that it  would in practice    be impossible to impose a S3rstem of coni-    pulsory sendee in Ireland without the assent    and co-operation of the Irish  Parliament.
      &quot; As to whether, as an abstract proposition,    it would be desirable, by vesting these powers    in  the  Imperial Parhament, to secure united    and simultaneous action in this direction in    both islands,  it  is, we  tlhnk, unnecessary    for us  to express an opinion,  as we think it    would  be impracticable effectively to enforce    such a demand, except with the approval of    the Irish Parliament without which the action    and efficient co-operation  of  the  Executive    could not  be secured.       &quot; Indeed, it seems to us a direct consequence    of the creation  of  an Irish Parliament that    any measure  of  this character  must  be    submitted  to  the  Irish Parhament  before it    could be enforced on Ireland.&quot;  We desire to emphasise the fact that the  abovereport  deals only with  one  aspect of  this verj&apos;difficult  and important question, and  that wewere not able  in  the  time then  at our disposalto go  into the possibilities of joint action by  acommon War  Coimcil  of  the  two Governments,or as to the effect of there being hereafter a FederalConstitution for the British Isles.Amendment moved (SIR WILLIAM GOULDING) :        To  omit the whole section.           Amendment rejected by  48 votes to 29.       Section adopted.  (See Division List No. 16).IV. Part II. of the Report, (&quot; Pohce &quot;), in which       the principal recommendation, passed  by       a majority of  the Sub-Committee,  was      that  the Pohce should be oontrolled  by      the  Irish Government.   The paragraphs      containing  this  recommendation   were      marked by asterisks.Amendment moved (MR. BARRIE) :       That the passages marked  by an asterisk    should be omitted and the Reservation of the    Duke of Abercorn substituted.  (This  Reser-    vation  was as follows : &quot; I  am  of opinion    that the  Royal Irish  Constabulary and the    Dubfin  Metropolitan  Police  should  both    remain as reserved sendees under the control    of the  Imperial Government for at least six    years,  and for  any longer period that the    Imperial  Government may otherwise deter-    mine.&quot;).           Amendment rejected by  57 votes  to 18.               (See Division List No. 17).       Part II. of the Report adopted,  by 57 votes            to 18.  (See Division List No. 18).  .

(See Divi-                sion List No.  19).              The whole Report was then adopted,                  without amendment,  by 54 votes                  to 17, March 19th.

(See Division List No. 41).  Motion  carried  and Report  adopted  unani-            mously.  (March 22nd).

378REPORT OE  THE  SUB-COMMITTEE  ON DEFENCE  AND  POLICE TO THE GRAND                                     COMMITTEE,                                      (LC. No,  27.)  The following are  the terms of Reference tothe Sub-Committee :   To consider   (a) What  powers of  local defence might be        delegated  to  an  Irish  Government        delegated with  the requirements of Irn-        perial Defence.

PART I.-DEFENCE.  The first head of  reference to the Sub-Com-mittee, extended as it has been to  the questionof Conscription, covers the whole ground  as tothe defence of Great Britain and Ireland, andthe best  military provision for  that purpose.Ireland  being an outpost of  the British  Islesowing to its  geographical position, it is deemedessential that these considerations must be takeninto account in devising a scheme of self-govern-ment for Ireland.  It was necessary,  therefore, to  obtain  fromthe Admiralty and from the Army Council theirviews as to  the strategic necessities  of the situ-ation, together with information as to the extentof the control which they desired to  be reservedto the Imperial Authorities over harbours andparts  of  the foreshore, crown lands, shipping,sites for  barracks and forts, or other defensiveworks; also as to what  powers should in war oremergency (e.g.,  imminence of war)  be reservedto the Imperial Government in respect of Cus-toms,  Telephones,   Telegraphs,  Wireless  andCable Services, or  of  the  right to  requisitionprivate property, whether ships, lands, buildings,or moveable goods, or of the control of aliens.  We accordingly requested the Admiralty  andthe War Office, in a letter dated November 6th,1917, to  furnish us  with their  views on  thepoints mentioned.   Some delay followed, and itwas not until January 21st, 1918, that a memo-randum in regard to Naval matters  was suppliedto us by the Admiralty with  an intimation thattwo  naval officers would, if required to do  so,give  evidence  before the  Sub-Committee.    Asthere was no question of raising an Lish NavalDefence Force, we did not consider it necessaryto request the attendance of these officers.               NAVAL DEFENCE.  In regard to Naval defence, the Committee  ac-cept unreservedty the Admiralty&apos;s view that  forthis  purpose Ireland must be considered as  in-tegrally  connected   with  Great  Britain,   anddefence must, therefore, be  by one force underone control.  It seems to  us unnecessary to go into the de-tails discussed in the Admiralty&apos;s  Memorandum,except to say that  in our opinion  some of  thematters touched on  might well be the subject ofagreement between the  Imperial  and  IrishGovernments.              MILITARY  DEFENCE.  In regard to the military problems, the Com-mittee assume that under any .scheme of militarydefence the historical Irish regiments will be apart of the regular army, that Ireland will be, asit has been in the  past, a valuable recruitingground, and that the facilities which it offers fortraining troops of all arms will continue  to belargely utilised with the general approval of theIrish public.  The question of raising a local Territorial Forcenecessarily engaged  our attention,   and Major-General Sir Charles Callwell was deputed by theWar Office, in a letter dated  December 19th,1917, to give us assistance on the military mat-ters  involved.  The  creation of an Irish Defence  Force of theterritorial type must be  considered in relation tothe  general scheme of defence of  the BritishIsles.  It is impossible, as we think, for the Conven-tion  to  formulate at present  either  in principleor in detail any scheme for the establishment ofsuch a  Force.  That question must largely de-pend on the corresponding conditions in Englandand Scotland.  We, therefore, submit the follow-ing as our conclusions  upon the question of anIrish Defence Force:   (1) That at  some time it is desirable that  Ire-        land should provide a local force to serve        in Ireland during peace, and in any part        of the United Kingdom during war.
 (2)  That we believe Ireland could contribute,       having  regard  to  its  population  and      &quot; social conditions, a sufficient number of       men to maintain two complete divisions. (3)  That the character of the organisation and       conditions  of service cannot be  deter -       mined until the character of Home De-       fence Forces after the war is  decided, a       matter which, as we are advised,  will       be  uncertain  until  after the  war,  and       will  depend  on  the character of the       peace  and other circumstances. (4)  That when this matter comes under  con-       sideration, the strength and organisation       of  the Irish  Force  and  its  conditions       of  service should be reported on  by a       Joint Committee on Defence consisting       of members of the Imperial Government       and the  Irish Government with military       advisers nominated by them, and  that       the whole matter should be decided be-       tween the two  Governments. (5.) That any such force,  if raised and paid by       the  Irish  Government,   should  be       reckoned  as part of the contribution       made by  Ireland  to common  Imperial       expenses.  (6) That in time of war  or imminence  of war        all  military forces  and organisations in        the United  Kingdom must pass  under        the  absolute  control  of the  Imperial        Authorities.       THE QUESTION OF CONSCRIPTION.  We have already submitted an Interim Report,which it will be  convenient to reproduce here, onthe practical aspect of Conscription in the eventof  the  establishment of a  separate Irish Parlia-ment and  Executive.   The report  was  as fol-lows:       29th November,  1917.      &quot; Assuming that a scheme of  self-govern-    ment for Ireland be  adopted, including the    establishment of an Irish Parliament and an    Irish   Executive   Government  responsible    thereto,  we think  that  it would in practice    be impossible to impose a system of compul-    sory service in Ireland without  the  assent    and  co-operation of the Irish Parliament.      &quot; As to whether, as  an abstract proposi-     tion,  it would be desirable, by vesting these     powers in the Imperial Parliament, to secure     united and  simultaneous action in this direc-     tion in both islands, it is, we think, unneces-     sary  for  us  to express an opinion,  as  we     think  it  would be impracticable effectively     to enforce such  a  demand,  except with  the     approval of  the  Irish Parliament  without     which  the  action  and efficient  co-operation     of the Executive could not be secured.       &quot; Indeed,  it  seems  to us  a  direct conse-     quence  of  the  creation  of  an Irish  Parlia-     ment that any measure of this character     must be submitted to the Irish Parliament     before it could be  enforced on Ireland.&quot;   We desire to  emphasise the fact that the above report deals  only with one aspect  of this very difficult and important  question, and that we were not able in the time then at our disposal to go into the possibilities of  joint action by a com- mon War Council of the two Governments, or as to the effect of there  being hereafter a Federal Constitution for  the British Isles.      *The paragraphs asterisked are  dissented from by             PART II.-POLICE.  The second head of our reference is concernedwith the future  of the Royal Irish Constabularyand the  Dublin Metropolitan Police.  The firstand the  governing question is whether the twoexisting Police forces in Ireland should be placedunder the  control of an Irish Government,  orshould,  as  in the case  of  the  Royal Irish Con-stabulary under the  Government of Ireland Actof 1914,  be a reserved force to  be under the Irn-perial Government for a fixed  period.  If an Irish Parliament and Government shouldbe created  with large powers of internal goveru-ment,   an  independent  Exchequer   and widepowers  of taxation, it appears  to us that  specifi- ^cally to  except from its functions the control ofPolice  would produce much  friction  and  lead tocontinuous effort on the part  of the Irish Govern-ment to get  rid of the  exception.   We cannot fail to recognise  that a good manypeople both  in England and Ireland  regard withapprehension the entrusting  to an Irish Govern-ment  in  existing  conditions  of the control ofpolice,  but  we  think that these  apprehensionsmight at least  be modified  if it were provided *that all powers  of appointment,  promotion  anddismissal were vested in non-political Officers ofthe Crown.  Further we think  that control of  theIrish police by the Imperial  Government  in Lon-don would have little reality or effective force.   The Imperial  Government could not intervene to prevent the Police carrying  out laws passed by an Irish Parliament, however much it might  dis- approve of them, and  in  matters  of administra- tion and detail British  Ministers would in prac- tice be dependent on their representatives in  Ire- % land for information and guidance, while  to over- ride Irish  Ministers and the Irish  Parliament on questions of local administration is a course they would  be  very  unlikely to adopt.   We  have  therefore   come  to  the conclusion that, if the principle of a separate  Irish Parlia- ment and Government be conceded, so essential an attribute of  Government as  the  preservation ^ of internal order and the enforcement of law in normal conditions could hardly be withheld from the Irish Government.   In case of any serious disturbance or outbreak involving  the security  and  unity  of the Realm, the Military  forces  of  the  Crown under  the* Imperial Government would be available  for such action as might be necessary.   While for the above reasons we think  that the control of the Irish Police should  be entrusted to the Irish Government, it is a corollary of our recommendation that  those  forces should be^  under the direct authority  of that  Government,  apart from  other reasons connected with  adminis-  tration and efficiency which in our opinion make  this desirable  and  to  which we  shall refer later  on in  this  report.    We  have been  furnished  by  the Inspector-  General of  the Royal  Irish Constabulary and by  the  Chief  Commissioner of  the  Dublin Metro-  politan Police  with memoranda  as to  the  con-  stitution  and  administration of their respective  forces, and both these gentlemen have been  good  enough to  attend  the Sub-Committee  and  giv*,  evidence  before it.    Their memoranda, with  note of their  oral&quot;evidence,  are annexed hereto  [Schedules A.  and B.]    We  desire  to make  the following observations  on these documents.the Duke of  Abercorn.  See his Reservation, p. 120.
ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY.             STRENGTH OF FORCE.  We have  no  suggestion to  make  as to thestrength  of the  Force.   The Inspector-Generalhas stated his  views  thereon,  and we see noreason to question them.    Varying conditionsmay enable  changes to be made and economiesto be effected, but these cannot at present beforecasted, and  must  be  dealt  with  from timeto time by those responsible for the Force.            BARRACKS-RECRUITING.  Similarly, we  do not think  we can usefully sayanything  as  to  Barrack accommodation or re-cruiting.   The latter must largely depend on theconditions of the moment.    ADVANTAGES  OF CENTRALISED  CONTROL.  On this subject we beg  leave to refer  to theobservations  of  the  Inspector - General  (SeeSchedule A., pp.  123-4).  After consideration of  these observations,  andthe first nine paragraphs of his &quot; conclusions &quot;(see p. 125), and after his oral examination there-on, we are  able  to say  that  we  concur  in theopinion he  has  formed, and  consider  that  itwould be undesirable  to make any  substantialalteration of the  present system of organisationand control  at this time  other than would beinvolved in  the  transfer  of  control from theImperial to  the  Irish  Government,  which  wehave  recommended by a  majority of the Sub-Committee.                     PAY.  The Pay is something less than that of EnglishPolice in the industrial districts higher than insome  of the rural English  counties but  con-ditioris differ, and we do not  think any  usefulconclusions  can be drawn from  these  compari-sons.  Questions of  pay  must be open  to re-consideration from time to time.  It should however  be bome  in mind that theRoyal  Irish Constabulary   perform  numerousduties in addition to police work,  such  as are notusually  performed by police forces in England.These indirectly reduce the costs of  other De-par tments of Government.  We instance  the following:               Agriculture.             Census.             Congested Districts  Board.             Board of Works.             Weights and Measures.             Food and Drugs.             Explosives Acts.             Petroleum. .             Illicit Distillation?.             Fisheries.PREVIOUS  PROPOSALS AS TO THE POSITION OF THE     FORCE UNDER AN  IRISH GOVERNMENT.  These   are  summarised  by  the  Inspector-General (see pp.  124-5), so far as they affectedthe Royal Irish  Constabulary, but  we  do notthink it would serve any useful purpose for usto comment on them in this report.   THE INSPECTOR-GENERAT/S CONCLUSIONS.  With regard to paragraph 4, col. 2, p. 125  ofSchedule A., we assume that if the control of theRoyal Irish Constabulary is entrusted to the IrishGovernment the  funds for its maintenance willbe provided  from the  Irish Exchequer,  subjectto the special local contribution  for forces  inexcess of  the quota provided in particular locali-ties.  The question of amalgamation of the DublinMetropolitan Police  with the Royal  Irish Con-stabulary  is  dealt with in the concluding  para-graphs of  Schedule A.  (see p. 126).  This may be  a  matter  for consideration  atsome future time,  if  experience  leads to thebelief that it would  be of  administrative advan-tage and would promote efficiency  and economy,but  at present there is no demand  for such ameasure,  and we think its proposal at this timewould be disturbing to the Dublin  force, andwould lead  to friction  and confusion.                            DUBLIN METRO] We have already said that, for the reasons givenabove,  this  force should,  in  our  opinion, passunder the control of the Irish Government, ifcreated, and be carried on under  the same sys-tem of administration as it is at present, subjectto  the  provision that appointments,  promotions,and dismissals should  be  entrusted to a non-political officer.  In practice this would probablymean the approval  of  submissions made to himby the Commissioners.  We also think for the reasons given above thatthis is not the time to consider the question ofamalgamation with the Royal Irish Constabulary.  We think it  right to call special  attention tothe observation of  the Chief  Commissioner onthe question of Local Control (see Schedule  B.,p.  129).  We  understand from him  that  though  thegrievance of  paying  rates without control isexistent, it  has not  assumed any  acute  form.                           * See the  Reservation of)LITAN POLICE.We consider, however, that there is weight in hissuggestion that the cost of  this force should beborne by the Irish Exchequer.  This would make it easier to effect amalgama-tion with  the Royal Irish Constabulary,  shouldthat be thought  expedient  at  any future time,and it would relieve the citizens of Dublin from aburden  which they may  not  unfairly  deem in-equitable so long  as it is divorced from any formof local control.  It is  to  be  observed that if the Dublin rate-payers were relieved of this burden similar claimsmight be put forward by Belfast and Londonderryin respect  of their payments for the extra forceof Royal Irish Constabulary permanently main-tained in  those towns.  There are some points in  the memorandum ofthe Chief  Commissioner on which  we desire tomake suggestions.ie Duke of Abercom, p. 120.
  We think it would be better that the Commis-sioners should be appointed by  the  Lord Lieu-tenant, with  a status similar  to that of a CivilServant.  Their appointment as Justices does not seemto us  necessary.   It would not often  be ofadvantage, and makes their position, as we think,somewhat  anomalous.  We also think that, as we  have suggested inthe case of the Eoyal Irish Constabulary appoint-ments, promotions and dismissals should be sub-ject to the control of a non-political Officer of&apos;theCrown.               FINANCE  CLERK.  We see no reason why this officer should be ap-pointed by the Lord Lieutenant, unless  he andnot the Commissioner is to be responsible to theGovernment for financial  administration.  Other-wise we think that he should have the positionof a Civil Servant of the First Division  respon-sible to the Chief  Commissioner.  As a general principle,  we think the Head of aDepartment should be responsible for its finan-cial administration.   DUBLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE COURTS AND          DIVISIONAL MAGISTRATES.  We concur with the Chief Commissioner in bisopinion that the cost of the Dublin MetropolitanPohce Courts and their staffs and the salaries ofthe Divisional Magistrates should no longer becharged to the Police Vote.              PAY AND PENSIONS.  Our  observations  on this subject as  to theRoyal Irish Constabulary appear to us applicablemutatis mutandis to  the  case of  the DublinMetropolitan Police.  We annex a memorandum furnished by theHome Office, which deals inter alia with certaindifficulties and inconveniences  arising from theabsence of any central control of police  forces inEngland.   [Schedule C]  The Chairman of the Sub-Committee has somepersonal knowledge of these difficulties in respectof the employment of forces from one locality toreinforce those of another locality in time of dis-turbance, and in regard to prompt action by de-tective inquiry in criminal matters.

POWELL.  2&amp;th  February, 1918.                       &quot;RESERVATION BY THE DUKE OF ABERCORN.  I am of  opinion that the Royal Irish  Constabulary  and the Dublin Metropolitan Police shouldboth remain  as reserved services under  the control of the Imperial  Government for  at least sixyears and for any longer period that the  Imperial Government may otherwise  determine.                                                                                 ABERCORN.SUPPLEMENTARY  REPORT.  The above report having been presented to theGrand Committee we have been desired by thatbody to reconsider our Recommendations.  No particular points  have been  indicated asthose which in the opinion of the  Grand Com-mittee call for reconsideration.  With regard to our report relating to Naval andMilitary  Defence  we  are  unable  to  find  anyreasons  which  in our  judgment  would lead usto alter  our  recommendations  on  that part ofour reference.  With regard to our report on Police, the PrimeMinister in his letter of the 25th February to theChairman of the Convention has stated that foradministrative  reasons  it is  necessary that thecontrol  of Police forces in  Ireland should be re-served to the Imperial authorities during the war.  Although the majority of  the  Sub-Committeereported against the reservation to the Imperialauthorities of such control for  a specific period,as in the Act of 1914,  our recommendation wasgeneral in its character, and did not necessarilyexclude  special conditions which might postponethe  application of the principle  that  an IrishGovernment controlling local administration anda Parliament with complete legislative authorityin internal affairs should control  the forces tomaintain local order  and  give  effect to  locallegislation.  We recognise that it may be  essential duringthe Mar, that Imperial control of Police should, foradministrative purposes,  be  retained in all  partsof the British Isles.  We  may  add that  our  recommendationsthroughout the report  are based on the assump-tion  of a Parliament within the Empire  so con-stituted  as  to afford  security  for  steady  andstable Government in  Ireland.

                                      Schedule  A.MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  QUESTION  OF POLICE   ADMINISTRATION   UNDER                                AN IRISH  GOVERNMENT.                             (By the Inspector-General,  R.I.C.).  For  the- convenience of  the  Sub-Committee Ihave in this memorandum first  examined  thesystem under which the Royal frisk Constabu-lary, at the present time, performs its duties,  in-cluding certain information regarding, recruiting,pay, pensions,  &amp;c.  I have then  made  a roughcomparison between centralised and local PoliceForces.  Following on this, suggestions are put forwardto meet the present situation, in view of  the con-templated  change of government in  Ireland.   Inmaking these suggestions  I have touched par-ticularlv on the question of policing Belfast andDublin.&quot; -  I would  submit, however, that  in a short me-morandum of this nature, it is impossible to givemore   than  a  general  outline of the  subject.Should the  Sub-Committee  require  more  de-tailed information I  would refer them to the fol-lowing Blue Books,  &amp;c.:     Evidence and Report, R.I.C. Committee of      Enquiry,  1914;    Annual Reports of -H.M. Inspectors of Con-      stabulary in England;    Judicial Statistics (Ireland), 1913;    &quot; The   Police  Service  of   England  and      Wales,&quot; by Stanley Savill.  (John Kem-      ster, 8 Red Lion  Square, W.C).            EXISTING SYSTEM.       (A). CONSTITUTION  OF THE FORCE.  The  constitution, strength, and  distribution ofthe Royal  Irish  Constabulary is  governed andprovided for, by a series of  Statutes ranging from6 &amp; 7  Wm.  IV., cap. 13, to  the Constabularyand Police  (Ireland) Act, 1914.  The  statutory  strength  of the  Force  is now10,715   Sergeants,  Acting-Sergeants,  and Con-stables.  This Force is allotted throughout  the  countryunder three heads: Free  Quota,  Extra Forces,and Reserve,  The  Free Quota is  that portion of  the Forcewhich  is wholly  chargeable to  the ConstabularyVote.   This  force is allocated  to  the  variousCounties and Belfast, in accordance with a Sche-dule laid down by the Lord Lieutenant in Coun-cil under the Statute 48 Vic,  cap.  12.   Thisallocation  is  made to  meet the normal  require-ments  of the country, and is subject now to re-vision  at any time under the Constabulary andPolice  (Ireland) Act, 1914.  The  last allocationwas made in 1909, and the number of Sergeants,Acting-Sergeants,  and Constables then  allottedwas 9,303.  In addition to this Free Quota,  there  is  anExtra Force  of 733 Sergeants, Acting-Sergeants,and Constables  allocated to Belfast per 28  &amp;29 Vic, cap.  70, section 4, and 60 &amp; 61 Vic, cap.64, sec 1.  Half the cost of this Force is  chargedto Belfast!   A similar extra  Force  of 14 menunder like  conditions  of charge is allocated  toLondonderry under 33  &amp;  34 Vic, cap. 83, sec  3.   There are also Temporary Extra Forces main- tained   (when  necessary)  in  disturbed  areas under 6 &amp; 7 Wm. IV., cap. 13, sec. 12.   These Forces vary from time to time, and at the present time there  is powrer to maintain 265 Sergeants, Acting-Sergeants,  and  Constables  in  counties Clare  and Galway East  and West Riding,  but the  actual number of extra Police in these coun- ties is now only 110.   Half the cost of this extra Force is borne by the county or locality in which it is serving.   Then under 9 and 10 Vic, cap. 97, there is an authorised reserve  of 400 Sergeants, Acting-Ser- geants, and Constables maintained at the Depot, Phoenix  Park.  When the Reserve are employed to police localities in the country, a moiety of the cost is. chargeable to the  counties or localities in which stationed, for  so many as are employed therein and for such a time as they are absent on the duty.   There is  power in the  Executive  at  all times to move the Police from county to county, or from Reserve  to  counties  for  special  and sudden reasons, and Pohce serving in a county other than their own are charged as to a moiety against that other county in respect to the number employed over the Free Quota of that county.   The actual effective Force now serving, being the  total of Free Quota, Extra Forces and  Re- serve, including Recruits in training,  is 9,238 Ser- geants, Acting-Sergeants  and men.   There are also 231 Head Constables serving, 4 of these being at Head Quarters, 8 at the  Depot and on the Reserve, and 219 in the  country.   As regards Officers: there are on the Constabu- lary List 240 Officers of all  ranks, including 1 Riding-Master and 1 Veterinary Surgeon.  As the Mounted  Force   has   now   been  practically abolished the Riding-Master and the Veterinary Surgeon will shortly vacate office, thus bringing the effective strength down to 238.  Of this num- ber  81 are at present serving in the Army and seconded, which  leaves 207 actually engaged in police work, i.e., 14 at Head  Quarters and Re- serve, and 193 in the  country in charge of Dis- tricts and Counties.                 (B). BARRACKS.   The Force is  accommodated in Barracks and Huts, of which there  are  close on 1,400 in  the country, and the  supply  of  barrack  furniture, bedding, etc, as well as the rent of barracks,  are chargeable to the Constabulary Vote, but  in  re- duction of this there is a  charge of Is. per week made to every man living in barracks.   The Barracks  are  for the  most part  hired houses held either on a yearly tenancy  or under lease (usually for 21  years with power to sur- render at 7 or 14 years) if the  Station is likely to be permanent.  In  some cases it has been foundnecessary to build Barracks.  In these cases theground rents are paid from the Constabulary Vote,the  erection  and maintenance of the  buildingsbeing carried out by the Board of Works, Ireland.In other  cases old Military Barracks and disused                                      Q
Bridewells  are  occupied by the  Constabulary,these  being also  maintained  by the Board ofWorks.  Huts occupied by Constabulary are con-trolled by the  Board of Works, but the groundrents are chargeable to the Constabulary  Vote.Where Barracks are held under yearly tenanciesor under lease the landlords  for an inclusive rentas a rule undertake repairs, and pay all rates andtaxes.  The lighting, heating,  and water supplyto Barracks is met by a scaled allowance whichvaries slightly  according to  local  circumstances.           (C). WASTAGE OF  FORCE.  Taking an average  over the five years  fromJanuary,  1912,  to  December,  1916,  the annualwastage  from all causes was 653; this figure ismuch below normal,  owing to men  being  re-tained in the  Force for the  duration of the warwho are otherwise qualified to retire, and who aredesirous  of retiring, on  pension,  were they notprevented by the Police (Emergency Provisions)Act, 1915.               (D). RECRUITING.  The recruits  for the R.I.C. are required  to be-5 feet 8  inches  in height;  36 inches mean  chestmeasurement;  of fair  education;  of the  highestcharacter; aged from 19-27 years, and physicallyfit.  The recruiting officers,  in the  first instance,-are the Sergeants in charge of the Sub-districtsthroughout  Ireland;  before being sent  to theDepof- for attestation and  training a recruit hasto satisfy the District Inspector  of his Districtand the County Inspector of  his County, and willnot be attested, even then until he also satisfiesthe Commandant at the Depot, and the Surgeonof the Force.  Formerly the great source of recruits was theyounger  sons  of farmers this class  supplyingmen of superior physique  and intelligence, witha proper sense of pride of position and self-respect.Recently this source of recruiting  has not provedso fruitful, the  reasons being in a sense  eco-nomic.    Land  Purchase enabled the farmer togive his  elder son a profession, and then he re-quired the younger to help on  the farm; further,the large rise in wages in the skilled trades  madea policeman&apos;s pay look paltry, and the&quot; improve-ment  in  secondary education   opened  the  CivilService and other employments to the farmer&apos;syounger son.  In addition to this, political unrest,especially   where  hostility  to  the  police  isapparent,&apos; often, for the  time being,  causes adiminution  of recruiting.  The difficulty  of obtaining suitable  candidatesfor the Police exists not only in Ireland, but alsoin  Great Britain (vide  Sir Leonard  Dunning&apos;sevidence  on page 210 of the Committee of En-quiry, 1914).  All recruits  are  trained at the R.I.C. Depot.The period of training is about six months, andthe   course includes  Drill, Ambulance Work,Swimming,  Physical  Training,   Police  Duty (theoretical and practical) and Musketry.            (E). PAY, &amp;C, OF  R.I.C.   The Pay of the various grades of the R.I.C. isfixed by  the  Constabulary  and Police (Ireland)Acts, 1914 and 1916.   In  addition to ordinarypay, War Bonuses have been  granted from timeto time to meet the increased  cost of  living.  A  Table showing the  maximum  and  niini-loum rates of  the R.I.C. compared with severalof the English Police  Forces is  attached as aNote to this memorandum.   (See p.  127).  Any comparison between the Enghsh and LishPolice Systems either as regards strength or ad-ministration is rendered difficult owing to the factthat the conditions  obtaining  in the two coun-tries are so wholly different in many respects.  In England there  is an absence of agrarian orpolitical unrest, which so often in Ireland requiresthe rapid and frequent movement of extra bodiesof Police.   Also  in  England  active hostility israrely  shown to the  Police, who  can as a rulecount  on the  goodwill and  co-operation of  thepublic in the detection of crime, and in the main-tenance of law and order.  This goodwill and co-operation permit of  the employment of isolatedpolicemen, where  in Leland a number  of Con-stabulary would be required to police an area ofthe same size or containing  the same population.  For  purposes  of  comparison  the  foUowingfigures with regard  to  the  total effective policeservices for the year 1913-14, which does not in-clude any of the abnormal conditions imposed bythe War, might be of interest:                  FORCE.

The  annual cost of a  constable of the R.I.C. isestimated at  95, for  the  purpose of  essessingthe moiety to be chargeable to counties.     (F.). THE DUTIES OF THE ROYAL IRISH                CONSTABULARY.  The original  duties of the  Royal  Lrish Con-stabulary are laid down in 6 Wm. IV., c. 13, butfor many years past their  duties  have beensteaddy  increasing alike in  number and variety.They are a highly disciplined and well educatedbody of  men,  spread over the  whole face of thecountry, in a web of which every  thread centresin Dublin.  It is easy to set such  a  machine inmotion for almost any purpose, and the Govern-ment taking advantage of this has from time totime  added  much to the  duties  of  the Force,which  now  does  work  for  practically  everyGovernment Department.  The men employed in work for other Depart-ments are not given  any extra pay,  but merelysubsistence  and  other  allowances,  under  theR.I.C. Regulations.  When considering the cost of the Royal IrishConstabulary,  therefore, it is only  reasonable to
set against this cost the expenditure which woulddevolve on  other departments were they calledupon to provide an  extra staff capable of copingwith  the work now done on their  behalf bv the,R.I.C.                                   J  As an example of this  extra work I would re-fer to the assistance in numerous matters whichis given  to  the Department of Agriculture-thetaking of the Agricultural Statistics being prob-ably the most laborious.  In  this connection I invite the attention of theSub-Committee to the evidence of Mr. T. P.  Gill,Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, inthe report of the E.I.C.  Committee of Enquirv,page  310, et seq.  There is also the Census, which  is, in Ireland,entirely carried out by the R.I.C., who also earnout sundry  enquiries on behalf of the CongestedDistricts -Board and of the Board of Works.  Furthermore,  the Force performs  the  duty ofthe inspection  and  verification of Weights andMeasures, receiving only a nominal fee of  4 perinspector, whereas in England in the cases wherethe police are asked to undertake this duty  theyreceive very much higher remuneration.  Other instances are duties under the Food andDrugs Act,  the Explosives Act, the PetroleumActs, the suppression of illicit distillation,  andthe enforcement  of  the Fishery Laws.     (G). B.I.C. PENSIONS AND GRATUITIES.  The Pensions and Gratuities payable to Mem-bers of the  Force are  governed by a long seriesof Acts of Parliament ranging from 6 Wm.  IV.,cap. 13, to the Constabulary and Police (Ireland)Act, 1914, amended by 6 and 7 Geo.  V., cap. 59.The following,  however, are shortly  the existingrules  governing  pensions to Head Constables,Sergeants and Men.  A man when he has completed  15 years&apos; ser-vice becomes entitled to a pension  under the fol-lowing scale,  if retired as being medicallv un-fit:-    On completion of 15 years ... 15-50th of Pay    For  each   completed  vear      from  15-20 add      &quot;...  l-50th of Pay    For  each   completed  vear      from  20-25 add        ...  2-50th of Pay    For  each   completed  vear      from  25-28 add      &quot;...  l-50th of Pay    On  completing 29   years&apos;      service       ...       ...     frd of Pay  If injured in the execution  of his  duty a  mancan be granted a special  pension at any serviceproportional to the injury received.   The widowsof men of 15 years&apos; service and over who die inthe Force can be given pensions during widow-hood and allowances for each child up to 15 yearsof age.  Men who joined  the Force prior to  1908may  retire  voluntarily  at  25  years&apos;  service,  buttheir pension will be calculated on  the rates of,pay fixed by the Act of 1908.  Any man who has30  years&apos; service and is 50 years of  age may re-tire voluntarily on his full pension of frd of his?ay.  Men under 15 years&apos; service who become medi- ;ally unfit from causes not due to the executionof duty, may receive  a gratuity of one month&apos;spay for each year of service, and widows of menunder 15 years&apos;  service may be given a similargratuity.  An Officer is somewhat similarly dealt  with,except that he  qualifies  for a pension when hehas served 10 years, and cannot retire voluntarilyuntil he has served 30 vears, when he receivesl-60th of his salary for each year of service; heattains his maximum pension only  at 40 years&apos;service when he receives frd of his salary.  The Pension List of the R.I.C. is a high itemof cost;  in the year 1913-14 the  total Constabu-lary Vote was  1,417,785,  and pensions and gra-tuities absorbed  410,040,  or almost one-third ofthis sum.  Since 1914 the amount payable in  pensions hassomewhat decreased, and in 1916-17 the pensionlist only absorbed   391,053 out  of a total ex-penditure of   1,473,106.   This decrease in pen-sions  is due to the fact that voluntary retirementson  pension  are  suspended  during  the   war.When this  restriction is removed  the pension listwill increase even above  the  pre-war  amountowing to the raising of pay granted bv  the Actof 1916.(H.) COMPARISON OF THE B.I.C. AS A CENTRALLY    CONTROLLED  FORCE  WITH  LOCALLY  CON-    TROLLED FORCES.-  The  R.I.C.  is  a  Centrally  Controlled Forcedirectly  responsible to,  and working  in  closetouch  with,  the. Executive;  it is thus  of thegreatest value in promulgating and carrying out,with the least  possible delay, the orders of the-Government.  The organisation of the R.I.C has stood even-test and trial to which a police machine could besubject, and it  cannot be denied that it has con-sistently and honestly  carried  out  the dutiesallotted to it by the Executive.  Centralisation was not arrived at immediately,as there was for some time a system of Provin-cial Inspectors-General, but this was abandonedand not reverted to.  For a short period, some 25or 30 years ago, there was a partial reversion todecentralisation by the appointment of DivisionalCommissioners  to deal  with  certain classes  ofpolice work  in  the  provinces  where disturbancewas  rife, but they ceased to exist  about 1898,and have not since been revived.  One disadvan-t-age of this system  was the large increase of cor-respondence, and the  uncertainty caused by dualcontrol.  Centralisation is, I understand, largely aimedat in the formation of Colonial Forces, who  oftentake  the  R.I.C. as  their model their  officersbeing trained at the Phoenix Park Depot.  Further,  a Centralised Force  wdiich, like theR.I.C.,  trains all its recruits in  one place and onone model,  ensures the Public  more even andmore  efficient  service, and,  by its system  ofdrafting recruits to  localities  other than those inwhich they  were born  and reared, reduces to aminimum any complaints of bias due to relation-ship in the  locality.  The tendency in England  to-day,  as regardsPolice  Forces,  is  towards  centralisation i.e.,bringing the  local forces more under the  controlof the  Home Office.    This  can be  ascertainedfrom  the evidence of Sir Leonard Dunning, oneof H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary in England,in the Report of R.I.C. Committee of Enquiry,1914, pp. 210,  et seq.  The Centralisation  of a Force also makes foreconomy in  administration, as large contracts foruniform&quot; equipment, and the many things  univer-sally  necessary for  a  Police Force, can be  morecheaply made than those for small quantities, andthere will be more uniformity of quality in thearticles so obtained.  The cost also of a centrallycontrolled force can be more equitably distributedand the policeman  will cost  the same wherever                                    Q. 2
stationed,  whereas  in decentrahsed  forces  thecost varies  enormously, rates of pay  differ oneforce being thus kept  up to  strength with  menof  superior type,  while  in the  same  provinceanother force granting lower wages can get  menof only inferior type.  Another advantage  which  a  centralised forcepossesses is greater efficiency in the tracing  andapprehension  of offenders, and in this connectionI may mention that in England, as a step towardscentralisation, just  before  the  war it was  pro-posed to establish two clearing-houses for criminalinformation for all County  and Borough Forces;but, owing  to the  war-, the scheme is  in abey-ance.  The alternative to a centralised force is a forcelocally controUed and  supported, to a consider-able extent, by  local  taxation.   The model ofsuch a force would be the  County and  BoroughForces of Great Britain.  These forces have beenestablished  under  certain  rules  ordained  byStatute from  time to  time.  One rule was  thatthe  proportion of Police  to a population shouldbe 1 to 1,000, but  this proportion has been  longsince abandoned; and,  taking the whole of Eng-land and Wales, it averages about  1 to  623.Another  rule,  which  is  still kept,  is  that . noborough  of  less  than  10,000 inhabitants couldhave a separate police force.   There  are   207boroughs of over 10,000 inhabitants in England,and  of these 130 have established separate forces,77 being  content to be pohced by the CountyForce.  On this standard, and disregarding Dubhn andBelfast, there  are 15 towns in  Ireland qualifiedto have  separate forces   6 of these being inUlster.   On  the present valuation,  and regardbeing had to  existing  rates in those towns, itis questionable whether many of these would beinclined to  shoulder the  cost of a local  policeforce, even  to the  extent of 50 per cent.    Theestablishment  of Local and  County  Forces inIreland would,  therefore,  mean a  very largeincrease  in  local taxation, and this  when  thevaluation  of the  country  is much lower than inEngland.  In England  and Wales, without including Lon-don  City and the Metropolitan Area, the rateablevaluation per head of the population is  5 12s. Od.  In Ireland,  excluding the D.M.P.  Area,   thevaluation per  head  is  3 12s. Od.  The valuationof the Provinces being:        Leinster     ...       ...   4 18  0      Ulster       ...... 3 12  0      Monster^    ...       ...   3  8  0      Connaught  ...       ...   2  8  0  The total rateable valuation  of  England  andWales, excluding London, is  162,257,595; whilethat of Ireland, excluding Dublin, is  14,893,930,or less than the combined valuations of Liver-pool, Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds.  On such a restricted  basis of taxation the  costof separate  police  forces would be  prohibitive,and  if Belfast elected  to have  a police force ofits  own, the  case would be worse.   If the 15towns of over 10,000 inhabitants elected to haveseparate  forces,  the problem of rating  the  restof the country for  the supply of police  forceswould hardly  be capable  of solution.  Financially,  therefore,  in Ireland a decentral-ised force would be the  case  of  many difficultproblems.  In addition  to the  above,  local police  forceswould not be easily reinforced, and  the cost ofreinforcement would lead to  endless  bargainingand litigation, as scales of pay would cary aecord-ing to different areas.   Local  forces would  beslower in promulgating orders or information, andwould not be  so prompt to act in the apprehen-sion of fugitive offenders.  There is a probabilityalso that the controlling bodies might raise diffi-culties  regarding  orders  affecting  their  policeissued by the  Central  Executive,  thus causingan order to be enforced in one area and neglectedin another,  and resulting in confusion and  inwant  of uniformity.PREVIOUS LEGISLATION MEASURES DESIGNED  TO    MEET THE  POLICE PROBLEM UNDER AN IRISH    GOVERNMENT.  With the establishment of a separate Parlia-ment in Ireland,  and an Executive responsibleto it, an entirely new problem arises as far asthe  R.I.C.  is  concerned.   This  Force is,  atpresent, an Imperial one, and paid from Imperialfunds;  the  amount of expense entailed  on therates  in. Ireland is, therefore, negligible.   Thequestion first arose in connection with the HomeBule  Bill of 1886, and Clause 21  (b) providedthat:-      &apos;.&apos;The Koyal L\-ish Constabulary shall, while    that force  subsists, continue and be subject    as  heretofore  to  the  control of  the  Lord    Lieutenant as representing Her Majesty.&quot;      (c) &quot; The Irish Legislature may provide    for the  establishment and maintenance of a    police  force in  counties  and  boroughs  in    Ireland under the control of local authorities,    and arrangements may be made between the    Treasury and the Irish Government for the    establishment  and  maintenance  of police    reserves.&quot;There was no  other  mention  of  the B.I.C.  inthe Bill.  The  question of control of the B.I.C.was,  however,   one of the  points  marked foramendment by  Mr. Parnell  (Hansard, vol.  304,p. 1134).   The Bill  never  reached Committee,and no schedules to  it were  printed; but thescheme seems to have contemplated the gradualsubstitution of  the B.I.C.  by local  forces, andthe  disappearance of  the   former  by naturalwastage all the vested interests  as  to pay andpensions being guaranteed by the British Govern-ment.    No  representations  were  made    toGovernment on behalf of either officers or men,because no  definite scheme was  formulated  asto their treatment  under the Bill.  The next  time the question arose  was in theHome Bule Bill, 1893.  This Bill contemplated-    (1)  The formation of County  and Borough          Forces by  the Irish Parliament;    (2)  The maintaining  for six years  of  the          R.I.C. under the control of the  Lord          Lieutenant;    (3)  The immediate cessation of recruiting;    (4)  The gradual  withdrawal  of the R.I.C.,          and,  when local  forces  were estab-          lished, an option  being given to mem-          bers  of the R.I.C. to  join  such  local          forces;    (5)  Existing rights as to pensions, salaries          and  emoluments of the R.I.C.  were          guaranteed by the British Exchequer;    (6)  The added service upon  compulsory re-          tirement as compensation for abolition          of office varied in the case of Officers          from ten to twelve years,, and was          ten  years for the men;
    (7) No allowance for increments which might          accrue during the added years was to          be  made  in calculating pensions.These terms were fully discussed by both officersand men, and neither class was satisfied.  In introducing the Bill on 13th February, 1893,Mr. Gladstone said:           The principles which we  recognise as    applicable to the consideration of the impor-    tant  question  connected  with  the  Royal    Irish Constabulary are  these: Their gradual    reduction,  their ultimate dissolution or dis-    appearance,  our full  recognition  and  dis-    charge of every obligation towards them in    such a way, as I hope we shall see, that the    interest of that remarkable  and honourable    Force will not be adversely affected in the    passing of such a measure as that now be-    fore the  House.&quot;  In the opinion of  the  officers and  men thenserving in  the Force this,  as  a sentiment,  wasconsidered excellent, but the  performance theymaintained fell far short of  the promise, and thepublication of  Schedule  VI. of  the Act led tomuch  dissatisfaction.   Memorials from  bothofficers and men were submitted to Government,and a  precis of their demands was issued as aParliamentary White Paper on 17th July, 1893.  The  Bill,  however,  not succeeding  in  theHouse of Lords,  the matter ended.  The  next proposal in the nature of Home Rulewas the  &quot;Irish Council&quot;  Bill,  1907, and in thisthe Royal Irish  Constabulary  was one  of theServices excluded from the control of the Council.  The  Act of 1914  followed, and  as- this is onthe Statute Book, and was thus fully  consideredand debated upon in both Houses of Parliament,where  due weight was,  no doubt, given to theprovisions and defects of  the  previous  Bills,  itmay be urged  that the  Sections  of this  Actdealing  with  the  R.I.C.  are  worthy  of  thehighest  consideration.   Moreover,  the Clausesand  Schedules of the Bill were very carefullyconsidered by two Committees elected to repre-sent one the  officers, and the other, the  men.Their  ideas were laid before  Mr.  Birrell,  whopaid due regard  to them, and made  severalamendments in the Clauses and  Schedules inaccordance  with the recommendations  of theCommittees.   As a result, Clause 37 and ScheduleTV. were included,  and Clause 5 of the Act laysdown a  transitional  period  of 6 years, from the  appointed day,&quot; during which the R.I.C. wasto remain under the Imperial Government, thusfollowing the precedent  set forth in the Bill of1893.                 CONCLUSIONS.  Having now outlined the existing organisation,etc., of  the  R.I.C.,  and having  compared therelative merits and demerits  of the  CentralisedForce with the  system which obtains  in  GreatBritain at the present time, it only remains forme to  put  forward  some  suggestions for theiuture,  assuming that Ireland will be  governedby  a  Governor-General  with, a Central Parlia-ment,   and   not  by  a  Governor-General  withProvincial Parliaments.  In the first place, I submit that it is  so impos-sible to forecast what the future attitude of thepopulation will be  towards the maintenance oflaw and order that, in  my opinion, it would beexcessively dangerous  even to attempt,  at  thepresent time, to formulate any scheme involvinga radical change in the police system as it nowexists in this country.  I would, therefore, urge in the strongest man-ner possible that, for a transitional period of, say,six  years  (this  being the  period that was foundsuitable both in 1893 and again in 1914) no radicalchange  be made in the  organisation  or  in  thegeneral principles under Which the R.I.C. is nowadministered.  The  present system,  I  would point out, will,during  this transitional  period,   admit  of  anyeconomies  which may be considered necessary.Such economies can be effected by the abolitionof recruiting; by the grouping together of countiesor districts for  administrative purposes powerto do  so having  been given by the Pohce Act of1914; also, should  it be found during this tran-sitional period that an armed force is no longernecessary, the training of recruits in the handlingcf arms can be  abolished.  At the end of  this period of six years, we shall,I expect and hope, be in  a  position to ascertainaccurately whether a complete change of  systemis possible or desirable; and, if so, which  systemwill be most suitable to the needs of the country.  In  making  these suggestions  regarding  theretention  of the R.I.C.  for a transitional period,I do not  feel  that  I am  competent or qualifiedto offer any opinion on the question as  to whoshould exercise  supreme control over the Force.I would urge,   however,  that, in  the  event ofsuch supreme  control being  placed entirely inthe hands of the Irish Parliamentary Executive,then,   on  any  matter  adversely  affecting  thevested interests  of an officer or man in the Force,such officer or man should have a right of appealto the  Governor-General.  I also feel that I am not competent nor in aposition  to offer any suggestions  or recommen-dations as to  the source  from which the fundsnecessary  for  the  maintenance  of the  Forceduring this transitional period should be derived that is  to say,  whether they should be providedfrom the Imperial,  or from the Irish, Exchequer.  Not  only for  the reasons which I have givenabove do I consider it necessary that the existingorganisation, etc.,  of the  R.I.C.  should not, forthe present,  be interfered wdth;  but there  areother and very important reasons  for adoptingthis course, which  I think cannot be overlooked.  In the  first place, during the difficult periodof the change from one form of Government toanother, the new Government will find it of thegreatest advantage to have  to its hand a highlyorganised and efficient machine like the R.I.C.;for example, the work of every large GovernmentDepartment is,  as I have previously stated, to agreat  extent interlocked  with the  R.I.C.,  anduntil those Departments,  under changed  controland organisation,  are  in running  order, theywould,  I  think, find  it  difficult  to  undertakethat portion  of  their duties which is now doneby  the  Force.  It may not be out of place here  to put forwarda  few  general  remarks  regarding  the   BelfastForce  and the  Dublin  Metropolitan Police.  The   former   Force,   amounting to,  roughly,1,200 men, is  provided by the R.I.C.,  and, inmy opinion, at  least for  the transitional  period,it would  be very unwise to interfere with  thisarrangement.
  Belfast  obtains  many advantages from thepresent system, amongst which  I  may  mentionthe following:      (1) None  but trained and  picked men are           sent to Belfast.  A candidate for the           city  force  must  have  probationary           service in the country before his case           is considered.    (2) Any man found  unsuitable for  the city           force  may  be re-transferred to the           country.   Service  in Belfast  is so           popular that  this regulation proves           itself to be a very considerable aid to           discipline.    (3) The proportion as between religious de-           nominations,   which  is  essential in           Belfast, is more easily maintained by           drafting men from the Force  at  large.           The supply  of Protestant recruits is,           I fear,  diminishing; and though efforts           have  been made  to  stimulate  it, I           cannot say that we are meeting with           any satisfactory success.    (4) At present no  man is selected  for duty           in  Belfast  who  is locally  connected.           This is a  very great advantage  for           insuring  impartial police administra-           tion.    (5) The Commissioner at Belfast works in           close  touch  with the   Police  Com-           mittee  of  the  Corporation.     From           interviews I have had with that Com-           mittee, and  from reports  which I           receive from time to time, the  Com-           mittee appear to be entirely satisfied           with the existing  arrangements.  As regards the D.M.P., the  question  of the amalgamation of this Force with the R.I.C. was touched on bv Mr.  Headlam, Treasury  Remem-brancer,  in his  Minority Beport  of  the  R.I.C.Committee of Enquiry, 1914, page  35.  He statedthere that  the maintenance of the separation ofthe two  Forces was due  to  historical reasons.This may be true, but in a very slight degree.The  D.M.P. differ from the R.I.C. in their con-dition of service, organisation, rates  of pay andpensions, and also in the nature c?f their  duties,and  the  manner of  performance.   Then  powersalso  are  in many respects different, and  basedon local  statutes,  and for  these reasons amalga-mation  would   be  exceedingly difficult.    Mr.Headlam&apos;s views,  I  may add, did  not meet withthe approval of  his colleagues, Sir David  Harreland Mr.  B. F. Starkie both of whom bave verygreat police and  administrative  experience  inIreland.  My own opinion is that, at least for the tran-sitional period,  no  such amalgation  should  beattempted.   If at  the  end of this  period  anyradical  change  in  the whole pohce  system isfound to be desirable, then the relationship be-tween these two Forces can be reconsidered.  In conclusion, I  would call attention  to thesafeguards of  the interests of both officers  andmen laid down in the Act of 1914.  In my opinionno safeguards less advantageous than those could,or should be, offered to the members of the Forcein any subsequent legislation.  I will,  however, asthe scheme adopted by the Convention assumesa  more  definite form, assemble  committees ofboth officers and men to advise me in regard tothese matters; this is following the precedent of1893 and of 1914.

NOTE II. Notes of the Oral Evidence of the  Inspector-General R.I.C.THE AUTHORISED STRENGTH  OF THE  FORCE  was  normally sufficient.  At present the Eoyal Irish  Constabulary  were  called  upon  to  perform  numerous additional duties in connection with  Food Control, the Defence of the Realm, etc.,  and, on account of the number of men absent  on  military service  and other  vacancies, the  existing  strength  was scarcely sufficient to  meet the demands made upon them.BELFAST was at  present  entitled to a &quot; Free  Quota &quot;  of  500 Pohce (Sergeants and  Con-  stables).   Its authorised &quot;Extra Force&quot; was  733.  The actual strength  at the present time  was, however, only 1,120.  Half  the cost of  the Extra Force was  chargeable on the local  Rates.   The present charge (for a moiety of  616 men) was about  29,400 per annum.   This  sum includes  a  certain  charge  for  &quot;  night  watch duty, and a contribution of  400 to-  wards the Town Inspector^ salary.  In Dublin  a Pohce  Rate (fixed by  Statute)  is levied in  respect of the whole Police Establishment.     Tn addition to the &quot;free quota&quot; of Sergeants  and Constables mentioned, Belfast has  also,  free of charge,  the services of 7  District In-  spectors and 28 Head Constables.     There has been no direct local control since  the policing of the City was  handed over to  the Royal Irish Constabulary,  in 1865, by the  28 &amp; 29  Vic,  cap.  70.  There is, however,  a  local  Police  Committee  of the  Corporation,  who from time to  time  make suggestions as  to  local Police arrangements through the  Town  Inspector, for the Inspector-GeneraEs approval.  The  power of this  Committee is  purely con-   sultative as regards the disposition and employ-  ment of the City Force. The relations between  it  and  the  Town Inspector  are invariably   harmonious.     It has been usual for several years to address  the Town Inspector as the &quot;Commissioner of  Police, Belfast, but he is  under the control of   the Inspector-General, like an  ordinary County   Inspector, having, however, a larger  salary.     The Act quoted  above  provides  that  &quot; the   Officer of the Constabulary Force in Belfast   shah consist of one Inspector,  who shall rank   as a County Inspector of Constabulary, and be   called the  Inspector  of Constabulary for the   Town of  Belfast.&quot; &quot;TEMPORARY EXTRA FORCES.&quot; These  are men   taken from the Reserve  Force or otherwise,   and drafted when  necessary  to  disturbed  or   proclaimed counties.   The Reserve  Force  is   kept at the Depot.  Counties are only charged   for men in excess  of  their free quota.   The   Constabulary Statutes give authority  to charge   an area, which might be smaller than  a county,   with half the cost of the extra  pohce sent there   on account of disturbance. ASSISTANCE TO DUBLIN. No inconvenience re-   sulted from the only recent occasion when the   R.I.C. were detailed for duty in Dublin during   the labour dispute in 1914.  The R.I.C. de-   tachments then worked under the  orders  of   the Chief Commissioner of the Dublin Metro-   politan Police,  but  he was somewhat doubtful   as  to whether the R.I.C.  as  such have any   legal status in the D.M.P. area.RECRUITING has been stopped from time to time  for periods as long as two years; for instance,  when the Wyndham Act  was passed; but it  had to be resumed, and it was found that  the  recruits then obtained were not up to the usual  standard, as the same  care in selection could  not be exercised owing to the necessity of rapid  completion of the numbers.     The present class of  recruits was up to  the  standard, but  there was  greater difficulty in  obtaining them.PAY. The  Force was not  attracting  as  many  recruits as it formerly did. This was possiblv  due to the fact that other callings were more  attractive.  Two shillings  extra per week  was-  granted to men serving in Belfast and Derry,  and slightly larger lodging allowance is payable  to married  men serving in those two and in  certain other large towns.  The  adequacy or  otherwise of the pay was  a difficult matter on  which to express an immediate opinion.  There  is  a  continual  tendency to raise the pay of  other pohce  forces, and the R.I.C. had to fall  into line; also the cost and standard of living  varied from  time to time.                *THE FORCE WAS GENERALLY  POPULAR,  but some-  times, and  in some localities, pohtical exeite-  ment  caused temporary unpopularity.   This  was the  case  at the present time  in  a  few  counties.TRAINING was both civil and military,  a consider-  able  portion of the time being  spent on the  civil training.  Drill was now part of the train-  ing of all  Police Forces.   The R.I.C.  was  trained to use rifles, and in this respect differed  from the Dublin Metropolitan  Police.   (The  latter was now,  he understood, trained in the  use of revolvers).   The military training did  not interfere with the civil training, but the  period of training  was,  he thought, somewhat  longer than  in England.ADDITIONAL DUTIES. These duties brought the  Force into  touch  with the  people  and gave  them knowledge and experience.  He was not  in favour of  limiting the Force to purely police  duties. COLONIAL POLICE OFFICERS were, before the war,  sent to be trained at the Royal Irish Constabu-  lary Depot  on account  of the high reputation  of the R.I.C. as an efficient  and fully trained  Police Force. LOYALTY OF THE FORCE. He had no fear regard-  ing the  loyalty  of the  Force  towards  the  authority set over them. THE QUESTION OF  LOCALISATION. He  believed  that  the establishment of local forces  would  be a  retrograde step.  There were great advan-  tages in the existing power of transferring  men  from one place to  another. It was  a rule  that  no officer or man was ever  sent to his  own  locality.  The  establishment of local  forces  would  involve  a charge upon local rates for  their maintenance   wholly  or  in  part.   At  present, outside Dubhn, Belfast  and Derry, all  localities (urban and rural) have a fully-equipped&apos;   and trained police force,  sufficient  for normal  requirements,  without  any cost  whatever.     No demand for local control had come to bis-  knowledge.
384PROMOTIONS AND DISMISSALS-Promotions rested  with  the  Inspector-General;  Dismissals with-  the Lord  Lieutenant.DETECTION OF CRIME.-In the rare cases where  crimes in  the country required special detective  work,  detectives  were  sent   from  Belfast.  There  was a staff of  plain-clothes detectives  also  at certain  other of the large towns, such  as Cork,  Limerick,  Waterford.    These men  were available for detective duty.  There was  no local jealousy in such cases.UNIFICATION  OF IRISH  POLICE. There  was  no  reason why Dublin should not be policed by  the B.I.C.  He believed  that  after a  time it  might  be  an advantage to  have one force  for  the whole of Ireland, but an immediate amal-  gamation  would,  he  thought,  only  dislocate  both  forces,  and it,  therefore,  should not be  attempted during the transitional period; not  only  were the rates  of pay  of the two forces  different,  but the officers above  the rank of  Sergeant  were differently  graded.SAFEGUARDS IN THE ACT OF  1914.-He regarded  these as satisfactory,  but he understood that  the opinion in the force had been that officers  and  men should, in  addition,  be  given the  right  to  immediate  retirement  with compen-  sating service towards pension.CONTROL. Assuming  an Irish responsible  Gov-  ermnent,  he  considered  that  the  Minister  responsible for the peace of the country should  have  the power to move and utilise  the police  at his discretion.Schedule  B.MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  DUBLIN METROPOLITAN  POLICE.(By the Chief Commissioner). fi &amp;IV, Vic, Vic,  The Constitution  of  the Dublin  Metropolitan.Pohce is dealt with in various statutes, the principalbeing 6 &amp; 7 Win/ IV. C. 29.  The Commissioners  are  not  members of theforce.   They  are &quot; Justices &quot;  appointed by theLord  Lieutenant under 6  &amp; 7 Wm.

For salaries see Note II.   (1).  Members of the Police force are appointed bythe Chief  Secretary or in his absence  by theUnder Secretary.  The powers and  duties  of  the  Dublin Metro -politan  Police are generally similar to those  ofother Pohce  forces  but they  also  act under anumber of special enactments affecting the DublinMetropolitan Police District.  The strength of the force  is not fixed by Statute.  The Chief  Secretary  or  Under Secretarj^ haspower, under  6 &amp;  7 Wm. IV.,  to  appoint &quot; asufficient number of fit and able men.  .   .  .&quot;  The appointment of all constables  must receivethe  formal  approval   of  the  Chief  or  UnderSecretary.  The maximum strength up to which the Chiefor Under Secretary has authorised the force to herecruited is as follows :            1 Chief Superintendent.          6 Superintendents.         25 Inspectors.         42 Station Sergeants.        148 Sergeants.         18 Detective Officers.        979 Constables.         36 Supernumeraries.  There is, therefore,  nominal authority  for  astrength of 1,252, but the Treasury provide forpayment of 1,201 only.   The latter figure is,therefore,   the  real  strength  at  which  it  isendeavoured to maintain the force.PAY.  The  pay  of  the force  is  shown  in  attached 4G &amp; 47 Vic,Note (Note  II.

EXPENSES  OE POLICE ESTABLISHMENT.  The  joint expenses  of  Dublin  MetropolitanPohce Estabhshment and Pohce Courts are borneby:-      (a) Parliamentary Vote.      (b) Appropriations  in  Aid.  The latter item is composed of receipts from :       1. Pohce  Tax.      2. Pines and Eees.      3. Carriage Revenue.      4. Publicans&apos; Eees.      5. Pedlars&apos;  Eees.      6. Incidental Income (Payments for Pohce             employed  by private  persons sale             of cast uniform, &amp;c.).  A Note (Note IV.) is attached showing expendi-ture under the various sub-heads  and amountsreceived  as above.  The Police Tax,  which  is the principal item ofthe &quot; local contribution &quot; is the proceeds of a ratelimited  to a maximum of 8d. in  the    on  thevaluation  of  the  Dublin  Metropolitan  PoliceDistrict.    The tax is now collected by the Cor-poration as regards the City, and by the  CountyCouncil  as regards the  portion  of the  DublinMetropolitan Pohce District which lies  outsidethe City.  Before leaving the question of Finance, I shouldlike to draw attention to the fact that the expensesof the  Pohce  Courts are  included  in the  DubhnMetropolitan Police Vote.   Such an arrangementobtains  in no other city, so far as I am aware,and except that it is hallowed by long precedentin Dublin  has nothing  to commend it.   In  myopinion there is something  almost objectionablein the fact that the Commissioner of Police shouldbe  the officer responsible  for  paying the Magis-trates before whom he prosecutes.   The Com-missioner has, however, no control whatever OArerthe Police  Court Staff, although their salaries arepaid by  liim.   The alliance  is an unnatural one,and should not, I  think,  be perpetuated.  The foregoing deals generally with the questionregarding the present constitution, pay, position,and functions of the Dublin Metropolitan Pohce,and I now come to the question of their  controland organisation under a system of Self-Govern-ment.  The transfer of  the Dublin Metropolitan Policefrom Imperial to  Irish control must, I suppose,be  regarded as  inevitable.  To hand over control  to the local authoritywould, however, in the first instance, at any rate,be injudicious.  No doubt, with the  precedent of the  systemin  Great  Britain  before them,  the  Irish localauthorities will ultimately seek such control.  I am not at all  sure that tins system of localcontrol is a perfect one, but  I  am convinced thatat the  outset of the new  scheme of Government,the better plan would be to vest the control of thePohce in the Department which will correspondin Ireland  to the Home Office across the Channel.  I am influenced in great measure in my view asto future organisation of the Dubhn MetropohtanPohce by  the following consideration.  A radical change in the system of Governmentmust entail a period of unavoidable confusion, untilthe various branches of the new executive gain thenecessary experience to ensure smooth working.Above  all  things  at such a time it is essentialthat the machinery for enforcing law and preservingorder should be as little interfered -with as possible  It mus&apos;. be borne in mind that the Dublin Metro-pohtan  Pohce  are now performing a number ofimportant duties outside ordinary police work :_    (a) Enforcement of Defence of the Realm Act.    (b) Enforcement of Aliens Restrictions Orders.    (c)  The  carrying  out of  the  complicated         system of Food  Control.    (d) The  Petrol  Restrictions  Orders.    (e)  The procuring of Statistics for the Depart-         ment  of Agriculture and Technical In-         struction.  I am, therefore, strongly of opinion  that saveas regards the  change of supreme control fromImperial  to  Irish hands, if  decided upon,  theexisting police system should remain unchanged.  Alterations may be subsequently introduced asoccasion  requires,  and opportunity offers, butthese should be  effected  gradually and with duecaution.  It may be appropriate  to remark here that thequestion of local control has always been a  sonie-what thorny one as regards  the Dubhn Metro-politan Pohce.  The citizens pay  in rates  a  considerable sumtowards the upkeep of the force, but have no sharewhatever in its  management.   On  the Englishsystem  the  citizens  would probably have to paymore, but the  control  of the Force  would  be intheir  hands.  Moreover, elsewhere in Ireland, the ratepayersfor the most part pay nothing  for their Pohce,while in those  cities where the  &quot; free quota &quot; ofpohce is sufficient,  the local  contribution is notnearly so heavy as  in Dublin.  This  differential treatment undoubtedly  givesthe  Dublin  ratepayers some grounds  for clis-content.  It would, I think, be desirable that this grievanceshould be removed.   I would suggest that  whilethe control  of  the Police is in the hands of theCentral Government the local  contribution (PoliceRate) might bo  dispensed with, tho cost of thePolice being borne  upon the  Exchequer.  The cost would then be borne by the communityat large and would fall on all alike.  The  suggestion   has   occasionally been  putforward that amalgamation of  the two Irish PoliceForces would have good results,  economically andotherwise. I cannot, however,  concur  in tins view.  Police work in Dubhn has ahvays been a matterof exceptional difficulty, and demands an adminis-tration materially different in  character from thatsuitable for  the rest of Ireland.  Dubhn is  not only the seat  of  Government, butis the natural  centre  of  most of the importantpohtical and labour organisations.  Activities ofthis kind must always  be matters of serious andspecial consideration for those responsible for thopeace of the City.  A  City Pohce Force  must  necessarily&apos;  haveentirely different characteristics  from those of arural  force.,  but even in the case of  the City ofBelfast, the  only city in Ireland where conditionsare at all approximate to  those in  Dublin, thenecessity for exceptional treatment and specialisedadministration  is not so apparent as in  Dublin.  Dublin is the last place in which experiments insuch  vital matters as enforcement of  law and thepreservation of public order should be attempted,particularly, as I have said before, at a time  whenthere  must be confusion and  possibly excitementand unrest among the  people
  The Royal Irish Oonstabulaty is a senn-militaryforce, while the Dublin Metropolitan Pohce, on thecontrary, is  a purely Civil Force.   Such a radicalchange might not meet with the wishes  of thecitizens of Dublin, while the Dublin MetropolitanPolice  would bitterly resent their  abolition qtiaDublin Metropolitan Police.  AU other  considerations  apart,  it seems  to me,however, that since  the various  local authoritiesmay possibly ultimately acquire  control over thePolice following the English practice it wouldbe futile  to  take the serious and  doubtful step ofamalgamating the two forces, with the consequentupset of existing machinery when the necessityfor again estabhshing a Dublin Force may arisewithin a  comparatively  short period.  I  have not  hi  this  Memorandum  made  anyrepresentations as  to the effect upon the interestsof the Force and Staff which a transfer as outlinedwould have.  When the Home Rule Act was underdiscussion the Force were permitted to place theirviews before  the Chief  Secretary, a course whichwas also followed by the Commissioners and Staff.It would, I think, be premature,  at the  presentmoment, to prepare similar  memoranda,  but nodoubt, an opportunity will be afforded them to doso, when the details of any new scheme are madepublic  and before  action is  taken to give legaleffect to it.

NOTE  V.NOTES  OE  THE  ORAL EVIDENCE  OF  THE  CHIEF  COMMISSIONER  OF  THE                         DUBLIN  METROPOLITAN  POLICE.  The Chief Commissioner was appointed by theLord Lieutenant.   He held office  at pleasure,retired at 65, and was a Choi Servant.  By Statute  he was  a Justice of the  Peace.He knew of no special reason why this should beso, but it may have been to meet special cmer-gencies.    For instance, he could read the RiotAct.    As  a Justice of the Peace he could signwarrants,  and  was accustomed to sign  pensionpapers, but that was all.   He agreed that it wouldbe a anomaly if it&apos;were possible for him to signa warrant,  order an arrest, and try the case, butthis could not happen in Dublin, as Justices of thePeace did not sit to try cases  (s. 1, 6 &amp; 7 Wm.IV., c. 29, last paragraph).  As regards LOCAL  CONTROL, he did not considercontrol by a Watch Committee to be a good system.It weakened the responsibility and disciplinarypower of  the  Commissioner.    Members  of theWatch Committee were liable to be interested  inmatters  coming under police control, for instancepublichouses.  PROMOTIONS AND DISMISSALS were  under hiscontrol.    There was  no appeal  in  the  case  ofdismissal, but he might be overruled by the ChiefSccretarj-.   He saw no objection to giving a rightof appeal to the Chief Secretary.  THE  STRENGTH OF THE FORCE was, generallyspeaking, sufficient.  PAY was a little higher than in the R.I.C.   Anincrease was under consideration.   It was lowerthan in a  large English town like  Manchester.The minimum was slightly lower, the maximumconsiderably lower.  THE STAFF was sufficient, not excessive.  CONTROL-The D.M.P. should remain under thecontrol of the Central Government as in the caseof the London Police.  THE COST OF THE D.M.P. should be borne whollyby  the  Exchequer, as long as central controlcontinued.   He did not think the  desire for citycontrol was strong enough to make the city wilingto bear the whole cost of the police.   There hadbeen no agitation for this  change, but  objectionwas almost invariably taken to paying the existingpohce rate.   He was not in favour  of partial localcontrol.  THE QUESTION OF  AMALGAMATION AVITH THERLC!-Throwing the  Avhole cost  of the D.M.P.on the Exchequer  AA^ould  not  imply that  thereshould be one Pohce force for all Ireland.  Dublinneeded a separate force.  In cases where assistance Avas required from theR.I.C., the Inspector-General Avas applied to, andthe consent of the Government  obtained.   ThereA\&apos;as no difficulty.    No special payment was madeto the R.I.C.   It did not fall on the Dublin ratesbecause the Police rate Avas always at its maximumof Sd.  There might be some gain in financial simplicityin haA-ing a single force for Ireland, but this didnot Avcigh against the  disadvantages.  The changeAvould be  unpopular.   Dublin  was not like Bel-fast.    There  Avere  many political  and  socialchfferences.   It AA&apos;as true that there Avere strongerlabour organisations in Belfast and  more socialism,and  in this sense a greater contrast Avith ruraldistricts than existed in Dublin, but the temperamerit of Dublin was peculiar.   There Avere  secretpolitical associations and the authorities Avere nosupported in the same way.  An unified Pohce  force might  facilitate  theinterchange of forces for sjiecial  emergencies and asingle dctectiA^e force  might be more efficient forthe detection of crime, but these advantages didnot warrant unification.   At present the D.M.P.detectiATe  force  worked  only  hi  its oavti  area.The R.I.C. force at Belfast Avas separate.  The D.M.P. men Avere of the same class as  in theR.I.C., mostly farmers&apos; sons, small shop-keepers&apos;sons, &amp;c.    There AA&apos;as no system  of placingProtestants and Cathohcs in separate districts.                Schedule  C.POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND  AND  WALES.  Questions  wore addressed to  the  Home Officeupon various points in connection Avith the  con-stitution  and administration of Pohce  Forces  inEngland  and  Wales.     A  comnumication  wasreceived in reply, giving ansAvers to the questionsasked, and referring in certain passages to  (1) Aprinted Memorandum issued in 1900 on  the PoliceForces : (2) A volume of 41 Home Office Circulars &quot;,(3)  Tho Official  Blue  Book on Pohce  for  1914:copies of all these documents being enclosed.  The questions, with the answers made to them,arc set&apos;out  in order bcloAV, and for conveniencenotes have been added,  Avherc  necessary, givingextracts or figures from the documents referred toill the text.  QUESTIONS 1 and 2. What arc the relations ofCounty and Borough Police Forces to the HomeOffice ?  What are the powers of County  and  BoroughCouncils over the  Pohce Forces, and  to  whatextent, if any, do these powers extend beyond theborders of the Borough or Comity ?  ANSAVERS 1 and 2.-The Annexed Memorandumon the Police forces of  England and Wales shows(1) the relations between the Home Office and theComity and  Borough Forces, and  (2) the legal
position of the local authorities in regard to theseforces.    Attention is  specially directedt to  themarked  passages. *   * NOTE. The marked passages are as follows :             COUNTY CONSTABULARY.   &apos;&apos; For each administrative county there is a forcegoverned  by a  Chief  Constable,  who  appointspromotes, and dismisses the other members of theforce,  and has the general government of  themsubject to the authority&apos;-  of  the Standing  JointCommittee, which  is composed half of represen-tatives of  the Justices  assembled  in  Quarter-Sessions the former Pohce authority of the comity -and half  ot  representatives  of  the CountyCouncil, the administrative body created by  theLocal Government Act, 1888.  The Standing JointCommittee appoints  the Chief  Constable subjectto ,the approval of the Secretary of State.   Thecomity forces were estabhshed between 1839 and185.6 under the direct supervision of the Secretaryof State.   Any change in the number of any countyforce is subject to his approval ;  he is empoweredto make rules for their pay, clothing and govern-ment.  Plans for county pohce stations are subjectto his approval.  The cost of the force is borne bya  local rate.   Special  districts requiring specialpolice  protection can be  rated  separately.   AnExchequer  contribution amounting  to half  thepay and clothing of the force is made from  theproceeds  of  certain Imperial revenues allocatedfor this and other  local purposes.   This is, hoAV-ever, subject to an  annual certificate given by theSecretary of State  that the force is efficient;  ifthe certificate is refused the Exchequer contribu-tion  is forfeited.   There  are now  sixty countyforces.   Comities,  like the Metropolitan  Policedistrict, are divided into divisions ;  at the headof the men in each division there is a superinten-dent.   The  divisions usually correspond with  thePetty S ossional Divisions formed for the purposesof magisterial jurisdiction.&quot;               BOROUGH POLICE.   &quot; Every municipal borough is, as a general rule,required  to establish a  separate force of police.An arrangement can, however, be made with thepohce  of  the comity in  which the  borough issituated for pohcing it, and this is done in themajority  of  cases.    Further,  boroughs with apopulation of less than 10,000  were wholly mergedin the county for  pohce purposes by the  LocalGovernment Act, 1888, and no  new force can beestablished  for a borough having  a populationof less than 20,000 at the date of its incorporation.There  are now 127 boroughs, with separate  policeforces.  The force  is managed by a Watch Com-mittee, which is a committee of the Town Councilelected annually;  they appoint the  Chief  Con-stable, and also the other members of the force.The&apos; cost  is  defrayed from local funds,  but theImperial  Government makes an annual contri-bution to the amount of one-half from the  samesource, and on the  same conditions as in the caseof comity  constabulary.   For this  purpose acertificate of efficiency from the Secretary of  Stateis required,  as in  the case of the  county con-stabulary.&quot;   &quot; Members  of the  Comity and Borough  forcesand  of the Metropolitan Police have  a right topension under the Pohce  Act,  1890 ;  and, as acontribution towards the pension funds estabhshedfor each  force under the Act, a  yearly sum of 300,000  is  distributed from imperial revenue.subject to a certificate from the Secretary  of theState that the management of the force and of itsfund  has  been  satisfactory during the year.&quot;   QUESTION 3.-How does the Home Office main-tain unity of administration in Pohce mattersthroughout the country ?   ANSWER 3. The Home Office can secure somemeasure  of  uniformity  in Pohco  administrationby its  statutory authority. *   For instance,  it canintimate that a force will not be certified efficientand will  lose its share of the Exchequer contri-bution unless it reaches a certain standard in pointof numbers, discipline or management.   The ap-pointment of women to  take  charge of femaleprisoners  and (at some places) the proper  equip-ment of mounted pohce has been insisted on intliis way.   It is found, however, that Chief Officersof Pohce  and local Pohce authorities are generallvready to adopt the Home Secretary&apos;s recommenda-tions without actual compulsion being exercised.Examples of this will be found in the annexedcollection  of  Home  Office circulars.   QUESTIONS 4  and  5. What central reserve ofPohce  Force is  there for use in  emergencies  invarious parts of  the  country ?   What arrangements are there between comitiesfor mutual assistance ?   ANSWERS  4 and 5. There is  no central forcespecially established as a reserve, but the differentforces  are accustomed to aid each other in emer-gencies.    Most  of  the Pohce authorities havestanding agreements  for this purpose with  neigh-bouring authorities (see circulars on pages 15 and72 annexed volumef), and  the Metropolitan  Pohceare sometimes  able  to  send a  detachment  ofconstables to any place where additional  policemay be urgently required.  The circulars on pages60-69 show the  practice advocated by the  HomeOffice in regard  to any serious civil commotion.   QUESTION 6. What special organisation is thereof detective forces (a) central, (b) local ?   ANSWER 6. Each  police  authority  organizesits own force separately, and there is no centraldetective  system, except that (i.) the finger  printsof convicted prisoners are kept  at the  HabitualCriminals  Registry,  New  Scotland  Yard, andreference  is made thereto  bjT the local forces forthe purpose of identification ; and (ii.) an arrange-ment exists for making the detective  staff  of theMetropolitan  Pohce  available  in other districtswhen their services are desired by the local pohce.See circulars on pages 40 and 70. j   QUESTION 7. May we have a few general figuresas to the  cost of  local pohce forces together withpohce rates and exchequer grants ?   ANSWER 7. Table II. in the Appendix to  theenclosed report of H.M. Inspector of Constabularyfor 1914 gives the cost of the Pohce and the amount  *Under the County and Borough Police Act, 1856, theinspection of the County and Borough  Police Forces ifcarried  out by two Inspectors of Constabulary,  for theNorthern and Southern districts respectively, who reportto the Home Office annually.  tThese circulars give  model forms of agreement, witharrangements for pay, compensation,  jurisdiction, etc.   The  former circular urges that in the case of all crime?committed  in  trains Metropolitan  detectives  should  becalled for.   The latter urges promptitude in any requestfor assistance and the careful  preservation of all clues.
of  the Exchequer  Contribution^    While  thepresent system can fairly be said to work smoothlyand harmoniously, it has long  been felt  at  theHome Office that more efficiency in pohce adminis-tration could be secured by such a revision of thearrangements  for  the  Exchequer  Contributiontowards the- cost of the Pohce as would allow ofthe Central Control being exercised more effectively.The proposals made for this purpose were acceptedby the Treasury Committee on Local Taxation in1914,  and will be found on pages 41-43 of theirreport.  Legislation would, however, be necessaryfor carrying them into effect.   Lastly, it may be mentioned that the need of  *The total cost of Police Forces in England and Walesin 1913-14,  as given in this table,  was  7,327,001, ofwhich   2,469,874 was  met by Exchequer  Contributions, 4,220,847 mainly  from local rates,  and  the  balance of 636.280 from miscellaneous sources.  Table III. gives the&quot;Net&apos;Cost&quot; of Police in England and Wales as  5,611,272.This figure  excludes sums received for services  of addi-tional constables, payments for rent, rates, taxes, purchase&quot;. of buildings,  etc., and any deficiency of the Police PensionFund.co-ordination between the different Pohce ForcesIn  England has  become specially  apparent inregard to  (i.) the enforcement of the  Defence ofthe  Realm Regulations  and orders made  underthem, and (h.) in the difficult position that hasbeen created by  war conditions with respect tothe  varying scales of pay adopted by  the severalpolice forces and  the allowances paid from  PoliceFunds.  There appears to be a widespread opinionamong Chief Officers  of  Police  that they shouldhave more  guidance  from  the  Home  Office inregard at all events to questions of the first men-tioned class, and  it is also thought that the corn-petition between  different  forces in  regard topay might be restricted  by  means of instructionsfrom the  Home  Office.     At the present timeconferences  between  the County and Boroughpolice forces are being arranged  with  the help ofthe  Home Office,  and though the difficulties in theway of any complete  co-ordination  under theexisting law are very great,  it is hoped that someprogress towards  it may be effected through theagency  of these  voluntary  and informal  con-ferencos.
REPORT  OF THE  HOUSING  COMMITTEE.                (LC,  No. 33).  (Adopted by Convention on j5th April, 1018.)             Scope of the, Inquiry.  1.  The  terms of reference to your Committeeare:       &quot; To  consider,  with  reference   to  the    Prime Minister&apos;s letter,  under what  con-    ditions Government assistance can  best be    given to  Housing in urban areas in Ireland.&quot;  The relevant passage in the Prime Minister&apos;sletter is in the following terms:       &quot; The   Government have  also had  sub-    mitted to them  by  the Labour representa-    tives  in the Convention the need of provision    for dealing with the urgent questions of hous-    ing in Ireland, and  on receiving recommen-    dations from  the Convention on the subject    they  would be prepared to consider the in-    clusion in the scheme  of settlement of a    substantial  provision for immediately deai-    ing wdth  this vital jiroblem.&quot;  In considering how  we could best discharge thedutv entrusted to  us bv the Convention,  we havebeen compelled to have regard in  the first placeto the necessity  of completing our labours  veryrapidly, in order  that the general  report of theConvention might not be  unduly  delayed.   Inthese circumstances we have felt  it, to  be quiteimpossible to undertake  the detailed  local en-quiries wdiich would be necessary to enable us  toframe an  accurate estimate of the extent of theneed  to be met,  and to submit  considered  pro-posals for dealing with it in the varying  circum-stances of different localities.  We consider, how-ever,  that it  is possible for us to fulfil the mainobjects  for which we were appointed  withoutundertaking an enquiry of an elaborate  nature.The shortage of houses in urban areas notorious.  2. The need for additional housing accommoda-tion for the working classes in urban areas in Ire-land is a matter of common notoriety.  In hisletter of February 25th, the Prime Minister refersto it  as an &quot;urgent  question,&quot;  and recognisesthe necessity of &quot; immediately dealing with thisvital problem.&quot;  We feel that in these circum-stances it is unnecessary for  us to argue whetheror not the need exists.  Its existence is admittedon all  hands, and  it remains for us to attempt arough  estimate of  its extent,       Extent of the shortage in Dublin.  3. In the case of Dublin, official figures are avail-able.   The Departmental Committee appointedto enquire  into the housing conditions in Dublinreported, in February,  1914,  that  14,000  newhouses or dwellings were required as a minimum.This was in addition to the necessity for remodel -ling existing  tenement  houses, so  as  to pre videsuitable accommodation for 13,000 families.  TheChief Secretary has been good enough to allo v usto see a special report on Dublin prep rred by Mr.P. C. Cowan, Chief Engineering Inspi itor tc theLocal Government Board.  The Repor; is a eon-fidential document, but we feel at liberty to makeuse of the  statistics and findings of factX &quot;hie h  iicontains.   Mr.  Cowan states that since ti ? mieof the Report of the Departmental  Connniitoe1,956 tenement houses,  in  which 3,989 familieswere living, have been closed by the Corporation,under its statutory powers.  In the same pet&apos;&apos; 1the Coloration have erected three hundred ujifttwenty-seven houses, and a very much smii&apos;!number has been erected by other agencies.  7&amp;:.Cowan, therefore, comes to the conclusion tho   u14,000 new houses were required  in  Dublin  in1914, at  least 16,500 are  required at the pros, nitime.  We are of  opinion that this figure may be  ic-cepted as a fair  estimate which errs, if at  all,  onthe side of understatement.    Extent  of the shortage in urban areas.  4. The Departmental Committee of 1911, w1 lieconfining their  detailed enquiries to Dublin,   &apos;\pressed the  following opinion  with regard to  sherest of the country.  &quot; We are satisfied that  -heproblems  surrounding  the housing  question  inDublin present themselves in much the same v.&apos; i\in most of the towns in Ireland, and we feel t  Hlittle  advantage would be  gained  by  analyfbgthem  over again in detail.&quot; We believe thai  i &quot;&apos;Committee were right  in holding that a  seal&apos; i .vof working class  houses  exists in  practically f]ltowns in Ireland, though  the  causes to whic &apos; itmust  be  attributed  are  different  in  differentplaces.  The case of Dublin,  with  its large h ft -ment  houses badly adapted for the  purpose \vl.&apos;.H 1they have been made to serve and generally   1bad state&apos; of repair,  is perhaps, to some extent.peculiar.  But in other towns other causes 1 nvc
brought about a scarcity of suitable aceommoda-tion which, if not so acute as it is known to be inDublin, is sufficiently serious to call  for imme-diate  and energetic action.  In certain areas thedifficulty has arisen from an increase  in popula-tion owing to industrial developments, unaccom-panied by an increase  in  building construction.Everywhere,  the  difficulty  or  impossibility ofcarrying  out  housing schemes on a paying basishas prevented  the construction  of  new  houseskeeping pace with the deterioration of older ones.We have  been  anxious, however, not to use theascertained figures for  Dublin as  an index  bywhich the need of the rest of the country can bemeasured, as such a course might lay us open tothe charge of exaggerating the difficulties of theposition.       Figures for the  county boroughs.  5. From the best information that we have beenable to obtain,  after consultation  with  the muni-cipal authorities,  we estimate the existing short-age of working class  dwellings in the  remainingcounty boroughs as follows :       Belfast        ...       ...     7,500Cork  ...LondonderryLimerickWaterford1,2501,0002,000  700  This gives us a total deficiency for the CountyBoroughs of 28,950. Estimate of the shortage in other urban areas.  6.  The population of the County  Boroughs  is eabout 875,000, and the total number of new housesrequired in  the  County  Boroughs works out atone  new  house  to thirty  of  the   population.In the  ninety urban  districts and  twenty-ninemunicipal towns  in Ireland  the population  isabout 614,250, and if we apply to this populationthe figure just arrived at for the County Boroughs,namely,  that one new  house  is required  forevery thirty  of  the  population, we  come  tothe conclusion that in these one hundred  andnineteen  towns   the  total  number   of  newhouses required amounts to  20,475.    We  feelsatisfied that this figure does not err on the sideof exaggeration.   The  conditions  in  some of thesmaller towns are exceedingly bad, and  there areplaces which do not come within the term &apos;&apos; urbanareas,&quot; in the strictly legal sense, where the needis  very  great  and pressing.   Amongst  such wemay  mention Kildare, Tralee,  and Mullingar.Adding the  figures thus  ascertained  to  the totalfor the  County Boroughs,  we get a grand totalof 49,425-say, 50,000.  We have, however,  thought it well  to checkthis figure by  another method of calculation.  Inthe Census of 1911,  the total number of &quot; thirdand fourth  class  houses &quot; is given  as  247,025.The town population may be taken  at  one-thirdof the total  population of the  country, and if weassume that these  houses are equally distributed,according to population, between town and coun-try we arrive  at a figure of about 85,000 as  thenumber  of houses requiring in 1911 to be replacedby new  buildings in the towns.   In the sevenyears  which have  elapsed since the  Census wastaken, the need has probably grown greater ratherthan less.  Taking a mean of the results of the two methodsof calculation adopted, we are of opinion that itwill  be  reasonable  to  estimate  the  numberof new working-class houses urgently required inurban  areas  in  Ireland  at  67,500.    It   isimportant, however,  that  an  early opportunityshould be taken of arriving  at a more accurateestimate  by means of a detailed enquiry.                Estimate of cost.  7.  Under existing conditions, the average cost ofworking-class dwellings, including the purchase ofland, the development of sites and the actualcost  of construction, cannot be put at  much lessthan four hundred pounds   We thus arrive at anestimate of   27,000,000 as  the total amount ofcapital  expenditure required to  deal with  thehousing problem in  urban areas in Ireland.   Degree of Government assistance required.  8. We proceed to consider what degree of finan-cial  assistance from  the central government willbe necessary to enable this need to be met.   In thisenquiry we  have  had the advantage of reading areport submitted to  the Ministry of Beconstruc-tion by a special panel of the Beconstruction Com-mittee on Housing after the War in England andWales. We do not propose to refer to the recom-mendations in this report, as it has been communi-cated to us  confidentially, but we may say thatthe report clearly establishes the fact that theconstruction of  working-class  houses   on  aneconomic basis has become practically impossiblewithout Government assistance, and that sincethe  war construction has  so nearly come to astandstill that the deficiency, which was alreadyconsiderable in 1914, is increasing at a rapid rate. Degree of assistance proposed in England and                    Wales.  9.  The English Local Government Board haveissued a circular indicating the terms on whichthe  Government  is  prepared  to give financialassistance to local authorities in connection withthe undertaking of housing schemes. This circularcontemplates the provision by the Government ofa percentage of the loan charges in connectionwith such schemes  sufficient to relieve the localauthority  of  seventy-five per cent,  of the esti-mated annual deficit.  More liberal assistance required  in  Ireland.  10. We feel it necessary to say at once that theterms proposed would be  altogether inadequateto meet the circumstances of Ireland. We under -stand that in Great Britain the problem of-housingin urban areas has been very largely accentuatedby causes due to the war.  There have been verylarge movements of population to localities wherethere  has  been  a great  growth  of  industrialactivity,  and the  normal provision of working-class houses  has ceased for  the past three and ahalf  years.  The increase in the rate  of interest, inwages and in the cost of all kinds of buildingmaterials has resulted in raising the cost of con-struction by probably not less than sixty per cent.
The proposals of the English Local GovernmentBoard are, therefore,  presumably, designed tomeet a situation which has been due to  specialcauses arising out of the war, and are based uponthe assumption that, but for those causes, it wouldhave been possible  for local authorities to supplythe amount of working class accommodation re-quired.  No such assumption can be  justified inthe case of Ireland, where already before the war,it wyas clear that the problem had reached  dimen-sions altogether beyond the resources of the  localauthorities.   As the provision  of the houses re-quired  was not found  possible,  to  a  sufficientextent, on the basis of pre-war cost, there mustbe  a  subsidy  sufficient to bring the cost  to thelocal authority well below the pre-war cost,  if aserious  attempt is  to be made  to deal  with theproblem.forthcoming.  In  this connection we would re-commend  an  extension of- the  principles em-bodied in the &quot;Clancy Act&quot; of 1908.  Underthat Act the income of the Housing Fund is dis-tributed  among  local authorities in proportion tothe charges in respect of loans raised by themunder the Act for housing purposes.  We recom-mend that  equal  assistance should be given inrespect of loans  incurred for similar purposes be-fore the  passing of  the  Act of 1908.   To affordsubstantial relief, the income of the Fund will re-quire to be substantially increased.  We  further   recommend  that   the  working-classes  in  urban  areas should  be afforded in-creased  facilities for acquiring on easy terms asregards security  and payment of instalments, theownership of the houses in which they live, whensuch houses are provided under the scheme whichwe  contemplate.   Degree of assistance  proposed for Ireland.  11. We are disposed to consider that the degreeof Government  assistance necessary will be notless than fifty per cent,  of the total capital cost,during the years immediately following the war.As the cost of building may be expected to decline,though not to reach the pre-war level, in subse-quent  years,  the amount of assistance from theGovernment could also probably be reduced.  Itis, however,  essential  that it  should  be suffi-ciently large to enable working-class houses to beerected without  throwing any but a small chargeon local  rates.   If this condition is not  satisfied,.we fear that the needs of the situation are neverlikely  to  be  met.  In this  connection  we  maypoint out that Parliament has already made corn-par atively  liberal   provision    for   providinglabourers&apos; cottages  in  rural  areas  in Ireland.Under the Labourers Acts, money could be bor-rowed for the provision of such cottages  at a rateof three  and a quarter per cent., which coveredboth  interest  and  sinking  fund charges, for aperiod of sixty-eight and a half years, and of thischarge thirty-six per cent,  is paid out  of fundsprovided  by the Government.    The working ofthe Acts  has given general  satisfaction,  and, theneeds of  the urban population being now certainlymore pressing, there is ample justification for ex-tending to them a more generous degree  of assist-ance  than that which has been  granted to therural   population.   The  general  conclusion  atwhich we have  arrived is that the number ofhouses to be erected in urban areas so soon ascircumstances admit of the work being  carriedout may be  put at 67,500; that  the total costwill  be approximately  27,000,000;  and  that itwill  be necessary for fifty per cent,  of the loancharges to be bome by the Central Government.       Assistance in respect  of past loans.   12.  We are further of opinion that a measure ofassistance,  which need not  be so large as fiftyper cent.,  should be given to local authorities inrespect of loans already incurred for housing pur-poses.  We are impelled to make this recommen--dation in view of the heavy burden which suchloans have  thrown upon the local rates, and be-cause  we   consider that local authorities  whichhave made  a serious effort to cope with the prob-lem in the past would  otherwise   be  unfairlypenalised,  in  comparison with those which have^deferred action until Government assistance was          General principles of policy.  13. The time at our disposal has rendered it im-possible for us to frame a general policy for regu-lating the provision of urban housing.  We are,moreover, of opinion that it is for the  Govern-ment to frame and for Parliament to approve anysuch policy.  We think,  however, that it is rightthat we  should indicate certain  general prin-ciples which ought, in our opinion, to be followed.  We recognise  that it would  be  impossible, or,at any rate, undesirable, to apply a uniform sys-tem and entrust the provision of urban housingaccommodation to any particular agency through-out the whole of Ireland.  In some cases the workcan best  be undertaken by the  local authority, inothers  by Public  Utility  Societies, or  privateenterprise;  and  the special  circumstances  ofDublin may even necessitate  setting  up a newauthority which would  be  able to extend itsoperations over  a larger area  than that of theexisting  municipality.   But we think that it ispossible  to leave room for the application of allthese systems,  while  observing certain  generalprinciples.  We are of opinion that, whatever bethe actual agency undertaking the task of con-struction, general control should, as a rule, restwith the local  authority, and  that the financialassistance from  the Government which we  haverecommended should be given to such  authori-ties, or  to private  owners or agencies,  subjectto the approval of  the  local  authorities  as  torents  and  other  conditions.   In  every case,therefore, the local  authority will be responsiblefor the general  policy  adopted, and the mannerin which it is carried out. In the event, however,of a local authority neglecting to discharge itsobligations in the matter, there should be power,on the analogy of  the provisions contained in theLabourers Acts, for the Government to interveneand provide the  additional accommodation re-quired.   We do  not  think that  it  should benecessary to set up a new department of Govern-ment to  deal with Housing,  though, no doubt,  ageneral increase in activity in this direction wouldinvolve increasing the staff of the Local Govern-ment Board.  We are of opinion that it shouldbe a condition of Government assistance that thesite and arrangement of the houses, the accommo-dation to be provided, and the rents to be chargedto the occupiers should receive  the approval ofthe Local Government Board.  We think that inall these matters  there should be as much  elas-ticity as  possible,  and that scope should be givenfor. experiments in methods of construction, de-
sign of houses, etc., but it is of the greatest im-portance that  a reasonably high standard shouldbe insisted upon, both with regard to the numberof houses to be built on any given area,  and theamount  of  accommodation  provided  in eachdwelling.  We note  that the  Bnghsh LocalGovernment Board have laid it down as a condi-tion of Government assistance that not more thantwelve houses  shall be built on one acre of land;and there is a  consensus of opinion that the mostsuitable type of house is a self-contained dweUingwith two or three bedrooms, a kitchen, a  sculleryand a bath.  A certain proportion of houses witha parlour, or  a fourth  bedroom  should  be pro-vided.      Reduction of cost of acquiring land.  14.  Under the existing law, the legal expensesand delays connected with the acquisition of landfor housing purposes constitute a serious obstacleto the carrying out of schemes.  We do not desireto overburden this report with a  technical dis-cussion  and we  are therefore  content to recordour opinion that these expenses and delays can beand ought to be reduced, and that the machineryof the &apos;&apos; vesting order &apos;&apos;  adopted in the  LandPurchase Acts would seem to be applicable to  theacquisition of land for  housing  purposes, andWould be attended by the advantage of ensuringprompt possession and security of title at a lowcost.    The distribution of compensation amonginterested parties, as well as the ascertainment ofthe amount due, should be entrusted to a LocalGovernment Board arbitrator.  ,                  Conclusion.  15. In the Prime Minister&apos;s letter,  which wequoted at the beginning of this Report, he statedthat the Government would be prepared to con-sider the inclusion in any scheme of settlement of asubstantial provision for dealing with this problem.In the event of an Irish Parhament and Govern-ment being estabhshed,  we  are,  therefore,  ofopinion  that that Parliament should have placedat its disposal  an annual sum of money sufficientto meet fifty per cent, of the loan charges whichwill be  incurred,  if the recommendations in thisReport  are accepted.

CONSIDERATION  OE  REPORT.Paragraph 32.Amendment proposed (MR. W. M.  MURPHY) : Insert at end of Prime Minister&apos;s letter dated 25th February:     &quot; The Prime Minister&apos;s letter created a  wholly new situation, for whereas in his letter to Mr.Redmond of the 16th May he invited the Convention to frame  a Constitution for Ireland within theEmpire, in the foregoing letter he practically defined, the only Constitution which he would adopt.The letter had the further effect that Lord Midleton, who was willing to give Pohce and every  fiscalpower except Customs  to the Irish Parliament on its creation, withdrew  from that position andsupported Lord MacDonnelFs Motion to withhold  Police and Post Office during the War, and bothCustoms and Excise for an indefinite period.    &quot; Again the Committee on  Defence had reported with one dissentient on the  26th Februarythat the control of the  Irish Police  should be entrusted to the Irish Government, but in a supple-mentary Report., dated March 5th, they referred to the  Prime Minister&apos;s  letter and came to theconclusion  &apos; that it may, perhaps,  be essential  that  during the War Imperial  Control of  Policeshould,  for Administrative purposes, be retained.&apos; &quot;Amendment rejected by 41 votes to 16.FOB (16).  -AGAINST (41).J.

MEMORANDUM  BY  LORD  MACDONNELL   IN  CONNECTION  WITH SECTION  V.   OF     THE  RESOLUTION  STANDING  ,IN HIS  NAME  ON  THE AGENDA  PAPER,*  N.B.-lows : -The Resolution referred  to  was as fol-  That  the Convention,  having  considered theletter of the  Prime  Minister  to  the Chairman,resolves to&apos; adopt  the  following  provisions andprocedure : -    I. The matters specified as unfitted for im-        mediate legislation, namely, control of        customs and excise by an  Irish Parlia-        ment,  be  postponed  for  further  con-        sideration  until after  the war, provided        that the question of such  control shall be        considered and decided by the Parhament        of  the United Kingdom within  seven        years after the conclusion of peace. For        the purpose of deciding in the Parhament        of the  United  Kingdom  the question of        the future control  of  Irish  customs and        excise,  a number of Lish representatives        proportioned to the population of Ireland        shall be called to the Parliament of the        United Kingdom.   II.  That the administration of  the Irish  pohce         and Irish postal service shaU be reserved         during the war to  the Imperial Govern-         ment, provided that as soon as possible         after  the  cessation  of  hostilities the         administration of these two services shall         become automatically  subject  to the         Irish  Parliament.III. That on the creation of an Irish Parhament      the adininistration of the Customs and      Excise sendees shah be  entrusted to a      Customs Board composed half of persons      nominated by the Imperial Treasury and      half  of  persons nominated by the Irish      Treasury, with a Chairman appointed by      the King.   Among the  duties of the      Board shall fall the ascertainment of the      true Irish Customs and Excise Revenue.IV. That, as soon as may be, a  Royal Commis-      sion shall be  appointed to determine the      amount  of contribution  . which Ireland      should pay.to the expenses of the Empire,      and  the practicability of estabhshing a      Free Trade agreement between the two      countries, should  the Imperial Parlia-      ment transfer to Ireland  the control  ol      its Customs and Excise. V. The embodiment in resolutions of the agree-      ments already reached on the Report of      the  Grand   Committee,  and  the  con-      tinuance of the discussions on the heads      on which the  Convention has not yet      pronounced its  opinion.VI. The framing of  a Joint Report on subjects      on which a general agreement  has been      reached,  and the framing  of joint  or      individual memoranda on  subjects  on      which general agreements have not been      reached.  If and when the approval of the Convention isobtained for the  first four sections of my Reso-lution on the Agenda Paper the materials will befor the most part available for drafting the reportof the  Convention so far as Finance, Police, andthe Postal services are. concerned.   The Conven-tion, however, was  assembled  for  the purposeas  stated by the Prime Minister in  his letter of16th May, 1917, &quot; of producing a scheme of Irishself-government,&quot; and until this is done the Con-vention  will not have discharged  the task itundertook.   I, like everj^one else,  recognise the necessity forexpedition.    Fortunately, the  materials for theexpeditious  conclusion  of the greater part of ourlabours are at hand  in the Report which has beenissued  (I.C. No. 20) of the  conclusions reached by the Grand Committee,  and of the questionsremaining for decision.   It is true that this reportdoes not bind the Grand Committee, still less theConvention, even on the, points on which no dif-ference of opinion is recorded, because ah the pro-visional  understandings  which were  arrived atwere contingent on a full agreement on the generalscheme  being reached ;  and  it  cannot be saidthis agreement  has bepn  reached.    This factrenders it the more necessary  for the Conventionto record its acceptance or rejection of the GrandCommittee &apos;s report.   It does not seem to me that this need be a lengthyprocess in  respect of the 21 heads  of the GrandCommittees report.   The Grand  Committee wereunanimous  in their provisional  agreement ontwelve  heads (viz., 1, 2, 4,  5, 6,  7,  8, 9, 12, 14,18,  and  19).   In  view of  the representativenature  of  the  Grand  Committee, the  careful    * This Memorandum is reprinted as it is referred to in the Report of the Ulster Unionists (seep. 80).
      representation and reduce to some extent      the rural representation.   The outcome is      that there  should  be  about 54 urban      members  and  about 99  rural  members,      making with 4 University,representatives a      total of 157 elected members, which with the      40 nominated Unionist members  will give      a  House  of  Commons  of 197  members.      The delimitation of  the  constituencies      would  naturally be the work of an expert      commission to begin  work when the Bill is      introduced into the Imperial Parhament.  Head 11.   The point not decided by the Grand      Committee under tins head is whether the      Senate  should  be  given  the  power  of      suggesting amendments  to  money  bills.      Some time ago a paper explaining the law on      this point in the Australian Parliament was      circulated to the Grand Committee, and I      think if that paper  were circulated to the      Convention  a  decision. could be speedily      arrived at.  Head 13.   The question  of Irish representation      in the  Imperial Parliament is important.         (a) In the first place the number of Irish      representatives has to be determined.   The      alternatives are the adoption of the numbers      stated in  the Act of 1914, viz., 42, or  the      number indicated by population, viz.,  65.         (6) In the second place it must be deter-      mined whether the   Irish  representatives      at  Westminster  should be  a  delegation      appointed by the Irish House af  Commons      or whether they should be  elected by  the      voters. In  the former case  there is  the      further  questiou whether  the  election      should be on the system  of Proportional      Representation.  In reference to the House of Lords I respectfullysuggest  that the  Irish  representation in   theHouse of Lords  should continue as at present,imless and until  that Chamber be remodelled, andthat in such a  contingency the matter of  Irishrepresentation in the House of  Lords should bereconsidered.  Head 15.  This question will have alreadj- been      settled, if Section I. of my  Resolution be      adopted.  Head  16. The question of the Imperial contri-      bution to  be  paid,  pending  the  report  of      the Royal Commission mentioned in Section      IV. of my Resolution, must be considered.      Obviously the Convention  cannot under-      take  an  inquiry into Ireland&apos;s relative      capacity for  making a contribution  or do      more  than  indicate  a rough and  ready      method of indicating the contribution such      as  my suggestion of  1 per  head of the      population, or  Lord  ]\Iidleton;s suggestion      of  19th  December,  1917,  that it should      be the proceeds of  Customs and excess      profits tax, subject  to  a transfer to  the      Irish  Exchequer out of these proceeds of      any sum  by which the Irish  Revenue,      at present rates, falls short of the estimated      expenditure of  1917-18 (with, I would add,      a suitable sum, say   200,000, for  the cost      of  the  Irish Parhament, Ministers, and new      departments such as the  Irish Treasury),      and to a further transfer of any increased      expenditure attributable to Land  Purchase      (and presumably Housing) under the  pro-      posals  adopted  by the Convention.discussion that was given to these matters, andthe provisional unanimity on them, I submit thatthe Convention  might well come  to a  decisionupon them without much discussion.  As regards the other nine heads  (viz., 3, 10, 11,13, 15,  16,  17,  20, 21)  on  which a provisionalaorreenient was not arrived at, it should be notedthat in some cases the lack of unanimity was con-hned to one or two sub-heads, that in other casesthe matters in dispute are  not very important,and that there are only two or three matters onwhich serious  discussion  may  be  necessary.  The points raised in these ten heads are as fol-lows : -Head 3.                                    .   Sub-Head (3).  The Army and  Navy.      The differences of opinion  in the  Grand    Committee were limited to two questions :      (a)  Whether the  assent of the Irish Parlia-    ment should be  required for Conscription,    and (b) Whether the Irish  Government should    be authorised after 5 years to raise a Terri-    torial Force under certain conditions.  There    need be no delay on these points if the Con-    vention adopt  (as I venture respectfully  to    advise them to  adopt) the Report of  the Sub-    Committee on Defence.   Sub-Head  (4). The question  of  Commercial      Treaties will not  arise if  Customs  be re-      served.   Sub-Heads (7) and  (8). The experience  of  the      Grand Committee seems to suggest the diffi-      culty of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion      on these somewhat technical and  involved      matters by discussion in full Convention.      The Convention might be content to record      the  fact  that  there  was  a difference  of      opinion on these points, without making a      recommendation.   But if  I may express      my  own  opinion  I would  recommend  a      compromise on the basis of reserving to the      Imperial Parliament&apos;Coinage, Legal tender,      Designs for Stamps and Standard of weights      and measures,  and by declaring  that,  as      regards  Patents and  Copyright,  Ireland      should  stand in the  position of a Colony      which had adopted  the provisions  of  the      Imperial Acts of 1907 and  1911.   N.B.-Head 9.  The term of the-Senates life      is not  stated  by the  Grand  Committee,      but as the Electoral  Sub-Committee have      recommended ten years I  think the Con-      vention might  agree.   Head  10.   The  Grand  Committee have  no      come  to  a  decision  on  the question  o^      Proportional Representation where  a con-      stituency  returns  3  or  more members.      Haying regard to the great preponderance      of affirmative  reasoned argument  on this      point in the recent debates in both Houses       of Parliament,  and  to  the  advantages       which must necessarily accrue to minorities      in Ireland from the adoption of the system, I       beg to recommend  that the question  be       decided in the  affirmative.         The Franchise will naturally be the new       Franchise under the Representation of the       People Act.         The effect of the findings of the Electoral       Systems Sub-Committee is to enlarge urban
  Head 17.  The Report on Land Purchase  has      already been discussed and is now down      on the Agenda  Paper for final orders.  Head 20.  Probably a general statement as to      arrangements for the  Civil Service some-      what  on  the  lines  indicated  would  be      accepted by the Convention, without much      discussion.  Head 21.  Of the services mentioned Land Pur-      chase and the  Postal Services have  been      dealt  with above.   The other services pre-    ,  sent no difficulty as the proposal is only a      provision  to enable the Dish Government to      defer  for purposes  of administrative  con      venience taking over certain services  and      does  not  seem controversial.  If the Report  of the Grand Committee be dealtwith in the  way indicated the Convention will bein an advantageous position to review the wholesituation ;  and to afford to the Ulster delegatesa further opportunity of suggesting additions to,or modifications in, the scheme which the interestsof Ulster may seem to them to call for.  If anyadditions are deemed desirable, it seems to methey  might advantageously follow  the line in-dicated in  my  proposals for a Provincial GrandCommittee. I  would  add  that such  a GrandCommittee ought not at the outset to be &quot;createdon  the basis of  a permanent  arrangement, butas an arrangement  to be  called  into  operationad hoc.  My expectation is that it will rarely ornever  be needed.  My hope is that Ulster willfind in a United Parliament for Ireland a bodyscrupulously read3^ to respond to every reasonabledemand of Ulster.
