&quot; E &quot;      The Convention adopted without a division a declaratory amendment moved &quot;by Lord Londonderry in these words           &quot;notwithstanding the establishment of the Irish            Parliament or anything contained in the Government            of Ireland Act,  the supreme power and authority            of the  Parliament ox the United Kingdom shall            remain  unaffected and undiminished over all persons,            matters,  and things in Ireland and every part            thereof&quot;. and  the  resolution for&apos;the  establishment of a Parliament for all  Ireland was carried by 51 votos to 18,  the minority consisted of Ulster Unionists.   Dr.  Crozicr,  Protestant Archbishop of Armagh,  voted with the  majority.      An  amendment  of the Ulster minority to provide that the powers and authority of the Irish Parliament&apos;shall not extend to the Province of Ulster was defeated by 52 votos to  19.    The supporters of the  amendment included  no representative from the South.    The  majority  included the Archbishop  of Dublin,  Lords Desart,  Mayo.  Midleton,  Oranmore,  and other  outhe-m Unionists, Lord  Granard,  Lord Mac&amp;onnell,  and three  Labour representatives from  the  North,  as well as  a large body of  Nationalists.      Amendments as to  the constitution of the  senate wore adopted  which reduced  the number of nominated  Privy Councillors from  eight, to four and  added two &quot;representatives of the  County Councils&quot; from each  of  the  four Provinces.      Yfith regard to the  constitution  of the  House of Commons it was agreed that  the  number of members  should be 160,  that there should  be  special  representation of Urban and industrial areas.,  that  proportional representation  should be  introduced In constituencies  returning throe  members or more,  and it  was resolved  that           &quot;The  Convention accept  the  principle  that 40$            of the  membership  of the House of Commons shall bo            guaranteed to Unionists&quot;.      The  suggested method of  guarantee  being the  nomination  by the Lord  Lieutenant of  20 members  &quot;with  a view to  tho  duo representation  of  interests not  otherwise adequately representtd in the Provinces of Leinster,  Monster  and Connaught&quot;,  and  the inclusion  in  the House  of &quot;20  additional  members  elected byUlster constituencies to represent  commercial  industrial and agricultural  interests&quot;.    The  resolutions for  tho  added memberswere proposed to the convention by  the Roman Catholic  Bishop ofRaphoe.   Provision was also made  for the period  of  continuance of nominated members with a proviso for addition  to  tho Senate if they are discontinued, and  on tho motion  of  the Bishop ofRaphoe if was resolved by 27 votes  to 20  that  &quot;tho extra rep re - sentation  in Ulster is not to cease except on an  adverse decisionby a three-fourths majority of both Houses Bitting togother&quot;.The minority who voted against this proposal consisted ofNationalists.   The majority comprised 11 or 12 Southern Unionisewith 14 or 15 Nationalists and one Unionist Representative ofLabour^   The minority were Nationalists  and Labour  repreeentativ                                                            The
aat 3 urn      The  Convention agreed without a division that repre-sentatlon of  Ireland  in  the  Parliament of the United Kingdom shouldjcontinue  and on  Lord Midletonls motion resolved &quot;by 42 votes to  24 that  the representation should be by 42 members elected by  the members of  the Irish House  of Commons on a basis of proportional representation.    The Southern Unionists supported the motion,, the  Ulster and Labour  members opposed it.      On Lord Oranmore*s motion the Convention agreed without a division  that  such representation  in the House of Lords should continue  for the present as it now exists.                            DJSffENCJa).      On the question of Defence a  Committee of the Convention had &quot;accepted  unreservedly the Admiralty&apos;s  view that for the purpose of Naval Defence Ireland must be considered as integrally connected with Great Britain, and defence must therefore be by  one  force  under one control&quot;*    as to Military Defence the Committee &quot;assumed that under any scheme of military  defence the  historical Irish regiments will be a part of the regular army,  Ireland  will  be,  as it has been in the past,  a valuable recruiting ground,  and that the facilities which it offers for  training  troops of all men will  continue to be largely utilised with the  general  approval  of the Irish public&quot;* !Phey  also submitted  conclusions in favour of an Irish Defence Force to  serve in  Ireland  during pes.ce and  in  any part of the United Kingdom during war,  the character of the organisation and ,conditions of  service of such force to be decided after the war, between the two  governments and resolved  that &quot;in time of war or imminence  of  war all military forces and organisations in the United  Kingdom must  pass under the absolute control of the Imperial Authorities&quot;*     As to Conscription they  expressed the  belief that &quot;it seems a direct consequence  of the creation of an  Irish Parliament [that any measure of  this character must be  submitted to the [Irish Parliament before  it  could be  enforced on Ireland&quot;,, I    They adverted further to  the  &quot;possibilities of Joint  action ky a common war  Council  of the  two Governments&quot; and to the &quot;effect If there being hereafter a Pederai Constitution for the  British lisle s.&quot;                                x I    A supplemental  report  recognised that  &quot;it  may be essential lhat during the war  Imperial  control of the  Police should  for [administrative purposes  be  retained in all parts of the  British lisle s,&quot; I    An amendment from Ulster  &quot;that  the  question of the  Military lie fence of Ireland is a  matter  exclusively for  the Imperial ^oyemment,, was  supported by seventeen Ulster representatives! [three  southern Unionists besides the Provost of  Trinity, and me Nationalist,  and defeated by 29  votes against  BE,  the parity which included  Lord Desart, Lord Granard,  Lord  LSaodonnell, fad Mr. Powell, K..C, consisting for the most part gt Rationalists. I    The Conmitteers views  on  Conscription were  endorsed by the Convention by  48 votes  against  29.    In  this  minority the Ulster Representatives were supported  by  several of the  Southern jaionists.
it 4 q       An amendment in favour of maintaining permanent Imperial control over the police at the discretion of the Imperial Govern- ment  was defeated by 57 votes to 18,  and the Supplementary Report above mentioned as to the retention of such control during the war was adopted by the same majority.  Leading members among the Southern Unionists voted in each majority.       As to the control of harbours etc.,  for Naval and Military purposes there is no proper provision in the Act of 1914.  Sectioi 2(9) of the Act excepts from the powers of the Irish parliament &quot;lighthouses,  &quot;frutJ/3 or beacons (except so far as they oan con- sistently with any general act of Parliament of the United King- dom be constructed or maintained by a local harbour authority)11. The convention resolved in favour of a proposal in these terms&quot;any necessary control of harbours for naval and military purposes and certain powers as regards li.Nuthouses,  buoys,  beacons,  cables wireless terminals to be settled with reference to the require- sents of the militaryand naval forces of His Majesty in various contingencies&quot;.  Thirteen of the Ulster representatives voted against this proposal^  no doubt as a demonstration against any limitation of the powers of the Crown such  as is implied in the words &quot;to be settled.&quot;                         FISCAL CONTROL.       As to finance,  the main decision of the Convention was  taken upon  a motion of Lord Macdonnell (with reference to the letter of the prime Minister to the Convention), the motion being to the effect that:-       The matters specified as unfitted for immediate legislation,           namely,  control of customs  and excise by an Irish           Parliament,  be postponed for further consideration  until           after the war,  provided that the  question of 3uch oon-           trol shall be considered and decided by  the Parliament           of the United Kingdom within seven years after the  con-           elusion of peace,  $or the  purpose of deciding in the           Parliament of the United Kingdom  the question of  the           future control of Irish customs and excise,  a number           of Irish representatives proportioned to the population           of Ireland shall be called  to the parliament of the           United Kingdom.      The motion was adopted by a majority of 38 votes against 34. In the majority there voted 21 Nationalists,  4 Labour representa- tivea,  10 Southern Unionists.   Lord Granard,  the provost  of Trinity,  and the representative of the Cork Chamber of Commerce. In the minority were 16 Ulster Unionists, 1 Belfast Unionist Labour representative,  and 17  Nationalists.   The last mentioned group included Dr.  o*I)onnell and two  other  Roman Catholic Bishops. So far as the  parliamentary situation is  concerned this was no doubt the most important division of  the Convention,  and  was remarkable for a minority composed in equal  proportions  of  Ulster Unionists and Southern  Nationalists.
