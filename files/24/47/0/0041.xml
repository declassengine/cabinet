THE DIRECTOR GENERAL.CAB/,mmCOFOOD PRODUCTION  DEPARTMENT,           72, Victoria Street,                     London,  S.W. (1) 3rd April,  1918.Sir,           I beg  to  submit the following report on the work of theFood Production  Department for the week ended 2nd April. 1918s-                       The Weather.           A considerable amount of rain fell In most counties duringthe past week, and,  in consequence, ploughing, cultivation, andsowing operations received a slight check.   The rain hss, however,done much  good in other respects, and work is again in full swing.                 LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.               Agricultural Executive Committees.Cambridge *  The  Departments Commissioner has inspected a derelictglebe farm of 400 acres at Little Gransden which has been takenover by the Executive  Committee.    Twenty soldiers have been at workpulling out the  bushes, as the whole of the farm is covered withthorny growth which  in some parts is so dense that one cannot pushthrough it.   Nearly 150 acres have already been cleared of bushes,and on this part of  the farm the  ditches have been cleaned out andbottomed.   The  land was very wet indeed but is  now much drier,  andthe whole  of this 150  acres will  be ready for mole-draining in afortnight&apos;s time.    There is every prospect of at least 150 acres  ofthis derelict farm being cropped  for wheat In the autumn,  and if,  asIs hoped,  it Is  found  possible to establish a prisoners&apos;  camp undercanvas at  the farm during the summer months,  three-quarters  of thefarm will  be under crops for the  1919 harvest.Kent.  In  April, 1917,  the  Committee took possession of a  farm nearChilham owned and occupied  by a lady by whom it  had  been allowed tolapse into a deplorable condition.   The farm has  been cultivated by
  the Committee under the supervision of a neighbouring farmer, and-has now been brought into an excellent state of cultivation.          -  A farm at Crundale in the same district was also taken  In April 1317, and has been cultivated under similar arrangements  the old tenant being retained as foreman.   This is a Down farm  the land is much poorer than that last mentioned, but here also t  land has been cleaned and brought into an adequate state of  cultivation for the 1918 harvest.  Lincoln -   A report received from Lindsey Indicates that an  addition has to be made to the already long list of difficulties  with which farmers have to contend In their efforts to  increase home food supplies.    A farmer at Kirton has appealed  to the Executive Committee for assistance in protecting his  crops from British bombs.            The farm Is situated close to an Aerodrome at which  bomb-dropping Is practised daily.   Airmen take as their  target a small patch of ground about 20 yards from the  boundary of the farm.    The result is that already over 100  bombs have dropped in one 21-acre field of growing wheat,  and  others near the homestead, etc     The bombs used are  of the  &quot;small flare&quot; type weighing 15 lbs.    If the bomb explodes,  it  merely burns everything around it within a radius  of 3 to  4  feet.   If it fails to explode,  as in fact frequently  happens,  it has to  be dug out.   The Department1a  Sub-Commissioner made  a  personal investigation of the  complaint and during his  visit several bombs were dropped,  seven being seen  unexploded  and others burning.   Recently the efforts  of the Royal Air  Force to bring the war home to the long-suffering farmer have  been varied a little,  and machine  gun  bullets  as well as  bombs have been found an embarrassment to  cultivation.
Northamptonshire -  In November 1917, the Committee tookpossession of a farm of 365 acres at Bozeatj  the occupierwho had recently purchased the farm decamped without payingthe whole of the purchase price.   The Committee sowed withwinter wheat 80 acres of the fat*m which would otherwise nothave been cultivated for 1918.   They have since withdrawnin favour- of a subsequent purchaser, who has paid thewhole value of the cultivations carried out by theCommittee.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 1 Order has beenmade authorising a landlord to determine a tenancy on accountof bad farming In respect of 150 acres, and 5 Orders have beenmade by the Department determining the tenancies of 864 acres.                     HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Provision of Land for Allotments - Reports received from 1,136districts show that 280,014 applications have been made forplots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No, 2),and that 251,474 plots containing 18,414 acres have beenprovided.          The Department have entered on the gardens of 12unoccupied houses at Birkenhead,Marketing - Arrangements are being made in various countiesfor the institution of Marketing Organisations.  It has beenarranged to divide the county of Kent into two parts,East and West,   In West Kent arrangements are being made forsetting up market stalls in various centres.          The county of Shropshire has forwarded Its rulesfor registration and expects to raise a capital of 4,000,          During the past week the Departments Inspectors con-ferred with 26 Local Authorities and as a result steps are being
taken by the Local Authorities to acouire an additional 401 acres(6,183 allotments).          At Nottingham 74 acres  (1,332 allotments) have been prlvided, Colchester 68 acres (952 allotments), Huddersfield 50 acre(1,000 allotments), and Portsmouth 35  acres  (525  allotments).                      TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land.   Two areas of land in military occupation hebeen inspected at the request of the ftar Office.   In both cases iwas found that only a small proportion of the  land inspected wassuitable for cultivation.  Advice as to the method of dealing witthe selected areas was given.Examination of Soils.  A complete examination  has  been made of tlisoils of the Elvedon Estate, Norfolk,  the property of Lord IveagfcThese are shown to consist mainly (80%.to 90%) of  coarse sand andfine sand.          It has been recommended that a careful  survey of thedistrict should be made to find where  the best clay could beobtained.  The soils are of the same type as that  at Methwold,cultivated by Dr., Edwards, and the other conditions are gene rail;similar, so that any scheme successful at Methwold is likely tosucceed here.Use of Ammonium Nitrate as Fertiliser.  At the request of theMinistry of Munitions a series of, field experiments has beenstarted to ascertain the manurial value of ammonium nitrate.Ministry has provided one ton of the material, a portion of whiclhas been offered to two Agricultural Institutions. The experimenjwill be made with various crops, including cereals, roots and solSoots and Flue Dusts.  A number of samples have been examined an)whilst household soot is found to be a valuable nitrogenousfertiliser containing 2\% to b%, and in extreme cases 11% ofnitrogen, boiler flue dusts and destructor dusts are in the mair/jworthless as manures, and are found to contain only about 0.5% mnitrogen and less than 1% of potash.
                     LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.   The War Office have supplied the Departmentwith a list of about 250 men who are now on compassionate leaveand are to be returned to their units owing to the presentemergency.  The Department are causing immediate enquiries to bemade in order to ascertain how many of these men can be sparedfrom the land.          A new Army Council Instruction with regard to theemployment of soldiers on agricultural work has been issuedduring the week providing that in future farmers shall berequired to provide board and lodging for soldiers employed inagriculture, paying for their services at the local l?:living-innrate.  This Instruction also provides that soldiers employed onagricultural work shall in future have their nei, civil pay madeup to their Army pay, and that in cases where soldiers fall 111or are injured while out on agricultural work, the farmer willbe held responsible for the pay and maintenance of the man forthe first three days of his illness.  For any subsequent periodof illness the responsibility rests with the Military Authorities          The total number of soldiers supplied by the MilitaryAuthorities to date is 40,249 (28,936 skilled and 11,263unskilled).  Of these men 36,818 (27,603 skilled and 9,215unskilled) are out on farms.  There is still a large demand foradditional soldier labour, but it is recognised that underexisting conditions the further provision of this labour canhardly be expected at the present time, and Committees arebeing advised to urge farmers to employ women as far as possible,and also to take the utmost advantage of the supplies ofcombatant prisoners and interned aliens that may be available.          The total number of men supplied for training astractor drivers remains at 3,626.
                                                              \Horses.  Orders for the issue  of 201 horses were given duringthe week, making a total of 6,995 horses handed over to theAgricultural Executive Committees to date.  In addition 906horses are on loan from the Military Authorities.Prisoners of War.  An additional 14 prisoner camps  (10 prisonerploughmen camps and 4 ordinary agricultural camps-)  were openedduring the week, making the total number of prisoners nowemployed on the land as follows  j-          From 51 ordinary agricultural camps   ,,,   4,650           w   93 prisoner camps     ...        ...   3,437          Employed from other  camps  ...        ...   l,oos                                                      9,095          Released aliens employed on  agriculture     1,647                                         Total       10,742          The number of schemes now frith the War Office is asfollows:-          23 Prisoner Ploughmen schemes        ...      675          28 Ordinary agricultural schemes     ...    1,263                                                      1,938          Owing to the lack of prisoners.now available foragricultural work in this country, a large number of otherschemes which had been prepared for the establishment of prisonecamps are temporarily suspended.                             Women&apos;s Branch.          As it is unreasonable to expect the ^Var Office, in thepresent crisis, to supply to the Department the additionalsoldier labour whioh they had  hoped for,, it has become necessarjto recruit as large a number of women  for farm work as possible,and labour efforts are being made to procure another 30,000 worn-for the Land Army.  A vigorous recruiting campaign  is to beinstituted immediately in London and in the counties.  Small
Recruiting Committees are to be set up to consider how best torecruit women under the particular local conditions.  Largenumbers have already come in in response to appeals in thepress, etc.  The London Selection Committee is&quot; sitting twicedaily in order to deal quickly with the volunteers.  A greatrecruiting meeting is to be held outside Woolwich Arsenal onSaturday next, and a large number of such meetings have alreadybeen arranged in various parts of the country.          The Exhibition recently held at Harrods&apos; Stores isproceeding to Yorkshire, Nottingham and Leicester in the nearfuture, and recruiting campaigns are being organised inconnection with this Exhibition in each of these places.          Training Centres have been opened in Wiltshire,Cheshire and Worcester.  In Warwickshire farmers are comingforward with offers to train women on their farms.  In Hampshirea large Training Centre for 34 students is to be opened at theend of this week.          A special training in hurdle making has been sanctionedin Berkshire where there is a great demand for this work.

efforts are being made to increase this number in view of thelarge demands for additional labour which are being receivedfrom farmers.Women1a Institutes.   Twenty new Institutes have been startedduring the last week.

Holland, Linos.  A splendid result was achieved by nine Fordtractors which have only recently arrived in the county and oneof which worked only 3 days.   These tractors have between themcultivated 636 acres and ploughed 16 acres during the week.   Oneof them cultivated 134 acres.Essex.  A Titan tractor of the Southend half-unit has cultivated106 acres during the week, making a total of 268 acres cultivatedby this traetor within three weeks.Montgomery.  Titan tractor.2091 ploughed 26 acres in 58 hours.Kent, vThere are 115 tractors at present working in this countyand the average &quot;acreage achieved by^ these tractors during the weekendgd March 22nd was 11.38 acres per tractor.                     SUPPLIES DIVISION.Superphosphate.  At the request of the Department, an amendingOrder has now been issued by the Ministry of Munitions authorisingIncreased charges for superphosphate sold in quantities of lessthan 1 cwt.   Lots of less than 14 lbs. are excluded from thisOrder,   Arrangements have been made with one of the large storesin London for the sale of this, fertiliser in small quantities toallotment holders.Wire Netting.  The stocks of wire netting in the hands of  ......manufacturers were exhausted during March, but a further supply ofsteel has been allocated for April, and this will help to meet thedemand temporarily.   A definite reply has now been received fromthe Surveyor-General of the War Office, to the effect that owingto the demands for wire for the Army In France, no increasedallocation for agricultural purposes can be made.Binder Twine.  It is proposed to purchase about 1,500 tonsof twine which had been held in this country for export toRoumania and elsewhere.   Th,is twine will be issued to theAgricultural Executive Committees for use on the Government binders.
The stocks of manilla hemp available  in  this country for themanufacture of binder twine have been exhausted and in.order to avoid the importation of further  supplies, arrange-ments are being made for the manufacture of twine from someother suitable type of hemp.    The quantity involvedmay amount to 3,000 tons, and in order to  enable themanufacture to proceed, it is proposed to  purchase thistwine and to hold it as a reserve to  meet  emergencies arisingfrom shortages in particular districts at  harvest time, orincreased demands from the Government binders.Copper Sulphate.  In view of the hoped for increase in theplanting of potatoes, and the additional attention which hasbeen devoted to spraying, an endeavour is  being made to reserv18,000 tons of copper sulphate for this  purpose.   The salesup to the present have been satisfactory.Insecticides.  By an arrangement with the  Ministry ofMunitions a quantity of lead has been allocated for themanufacture of lead arsenate, and also of  tinplates for themanufacture of containers for liquid  insecticides.Stable Manure.  The disposal of manure from the large armydump near Aldershot is proceeding as  rapidly as transportfacilities will allow.    About 2,600 tons have so farbeen delivered.Seed Oats.  The last cargo of Black Tartarian oats fromIreland has arrived.   The demand for this variety ofseed is now declining.Seed Potato Supply.  Owing to the holidays it is impossibleto tabulate the exact &quot;figures for last week&apos;a deliveriesbut excluding deliveries to the ports the  approximatequantity delivered in England and Wales  Is 1,500 tons.
Wart Disease of Potatoes.  A few cases of contravention of theWart Disease of Potatoes  (Restricted Districts)  Order of 1917No. 1 are still being reported.          No serious cases of deliberate breach  have been foundon enquiry, but some strong warnings have been issued to offendersand they have been informed that proceedings will be.taken in theevent of a subsequent offence.          The Potatoes  (Corky Scab) Suspension Order of 1918 hasnow been issued.  : By this Order the operation of the Potatoes(Corky Scab) Order of 1914 is suspended for the  time being, as itis not essential at the present time to continue its administration.Pctate Zyvaying,1   Lectures have been attended during the week bydeck workers at Liverpool, and by the employees-of Messrs. Cadbury,in addition to the ordinary audiences.   At Portland a lecture wasattended by the prison officials, Including the  Deputy&apos;Governorand the Chaplain, and at Felixstowe a lecture is to be given at theArmy Brigade headquarters.   At  Sandringham a lecture was given togardeners snd allotment holders, living on the Royal estate.High Prices of Seeds - Correspondents frequently draw attentionto the present high prices of seeds and urge the desirability offixing prices.          As it is now the middle of the sowing  season it isimpossible to take action as regards the price of seeds for thisseason.   Moreover, unless prices rise to such an extent as toaffect food production seriously it appears undesirable that anysuch action should be considered In connection with the seeds whichwill be required next year.   Fixing the prica of seeds is anextremely complicated problem, particularly in view of the factthat r large proportion of our supply is obtained from overseas.A limitation in the selling price here might ersily lead to foreignsupplies being diverted to countries where better prices areobtainable.
\          Tentative steps have been taken with  a view to an In!Ally Conference being held to consider  the possibility of international action in connection with the  production, distributionand price of seeds.Sunflower -Seed - Owing to the attention which has been dra^n by                                   cthe Department to the value of Sunflower seed as a poultry foodand for its oil content, a considerably increased demand hasarisen for this seed for sowing;                      -  ;&quot;          The bulk of the wholesale stocks of Sunflo\7er seed iscontrolled by the Ministry of Food and  it has,  therefore, beenpossible to release parcels at a definite price and to advisepurchasers what they should pay when  obtaining  supplies from thretail seedsmen.   Cases have been brought to the Departmentsnotice where considerably higher prices than those published we:being asked, but in each case the retailer when written to by tDepartment has agreed to reduce his price to the figure fixed,                          I am,                               Sir,                                   Your obedient Servant,Director-General,The Right Hon. R,E, Prothero, M.P.     President of the Board of Agriculture                     and Fisheries.
