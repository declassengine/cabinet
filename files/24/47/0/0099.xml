April 1918.SECRET.G.T.-4197.                       THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 10th April, 1918.                                  SUMMARY.Part I: General Remarks.   . The new  man-power proposals are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.    The opinion of the Labour press on the  German offensive, foreign affairs, thecomb-out, political conferences, food, and pacifism is summarised.Part III: District Reports.    The general situation is distinctly tranquil.Part IV:  Disputes.    (a.) Involving a stoppage of work. A serious strike of boilermakers at Messrs.Harland and  Wolffs,  Liverpool, is  reported.    (b.) Not involving a stoppage of work. A serious dispute has occurred betweenthe electricians and Messrs. Beardmore and  Company,  Glasgow.  There  is also adispute of some gravity among the boilermakers employed by Messrs. Booth, Bolton.                            I. GENERAL REMARKS.New Man-Power Proposals.    Although at the time of publication of the Labour papers of the week thedetailed  proposals of the  Government  with the object  of  increasing man-poweravailable for the army had not yet been announced, certain of them have anticipatedthose proposals, and it is interesting and not unimportant to realise the point ofview which will probably be taken by these exponents of Labour opinion.    The  urgency of national necessity in consequence of the present crisis hasresulted in stimulating the patriotism of the working classes of the country, as isevidenced by the fact that, not only is the Miners&apos; Federation assisting the Govern-ment in the comb-out, but a considerable number of-miners are now enlisting in thearmy without waiting for their calling-up notices.   The same symptom has alreadybeen reported in the case of the engineers.   These facts should not, however, obscurethe likelihood of organised opposition to the man-power proposals  announced bythe Prime Minister in the  House of Commons  on the 9th March, and the Labourpapers of the week indicate, perhaps, the lines which that opposition will take.    In the first place it is urged that conscription of men up to  50 or 51 willcertainly not result  in supplying the immediate necessities of the Army.   Thisis  pointed out  in  several papers, notably  by the &quot;Herald&quot;  and the &quot;Nation.&quot;The latter paper insists that the essential necessity of the moment is the constructionof ships, which will be  available to convey the practically limitless man-powerresources of the American nation to the Western  front.[lino-24]B
    The second point urged, again principally by the &quot; Herald,&quot; is that the con-elusion of the present German offensive will be an opportune moment for the dis-cussion of a peopled peace.  It gives no grounds for its faith in the willingness ofthe German nation to extend the olive branch to the Western Powers, which Germanyhopes, and probably expects, utterly to defeat.    It is further urged that the extension of the age to 50 will not result in anymaterial increase in the numbers available for the army.   The  &quot; Nation &quot; antici-pates that it may  possibly produce 100,000  men-an inadequate counterpoise tothe economic and industrial disturbance which is bound to ensue.    Strong objection  to the proposals is taken in several papers; notably  in the&quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; New Statesman,&quot; on the ground that they in fact aim at industrialconscription.   The  latter paper voices the objection on the strength of a rumourthat men between 43 and 50 will mainly be allotted not to the fighting forces, butto various essential industries, such as  munition making,  shipbuilding, and agri-culture.   The &quot; Herald &quot; suggests that the object of the Government is deliberatelyto conscript men who will prove unfit for the strain of the army, in order that theirservice may then be commuted  to service  of another kind.    Finally, the extension of  the conscriptive age is attacked on the  ground thatit is not accompanied by provision for the conscription of wealth.   The argument isused  by the &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot; that an  increase in the  army will inevitablyentail a large increase  in the expenditure on the  war, for which money will beraised by loans at not less than 5  per cent., and that the interest will be obtainedin the future by exploiting the labour of the working classes.    The conclusion at which  the various papers arrive is  perhaps best describedin the words of the &quot; Herald &apos;&apos;:      &quot; The Government will be unwise if it acts on the assumption that  now is thetime  to  rush things through while the  country is thinking of the great offensive.We doubt if a drastic new proposal for a comb-out wrould be  well received, and weare quite  convinced that it would be bad  policy for the  nation.&quot;     It  is true that the  leading Labour  and Socialist journals are pacifist in theirtone; there is  reason to believe that in general the working classes are more likelyto be influenced^by the sense of the nation&apos;s need than by the opinions and argumentseven  of  their leading  papers.   At the same time it appears certain that  the drasticproposals, which have proved necessary in the interests of the nation as a  whole,will be  met by insistent opposition and clamour in those  sections of the industrialworld which these papers represent.     The unpopularity of the conscription of middle-aged men is bound  to be great in all classes, and that it is not confined  to the working classes is  shown  by thevigorous protest of  the London  solicitors.   In these circumstances the extremesection  are sure to make the most of their opportunity, and on the Clyde they are already said to be busy among  the older men,  who have hitherto supported the comb-out, but are inclined to  revise  their opinion now that they may be taken  themselves. The Irishmen on the Clyde and the Mersev may also be relied upon to make as much trouble  as possible.                             II. PRESS COMMENTS.The German Offensive.    The remarkable rally of  the Labour and Socialist press which was noted lastweek  already shows  signs of exhausting itself.   The  &quot;Call,&quot; which  practicallyignored the  subject in its last edition now  comes out into the open,  and,  whileexpressing sympathy with the men &quot; on both sides,&quot;  calls upon  the  workers tointervene and stop this  &quot; immolation &quot; of themselves.   The  &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot;is of  opinion that the German offensive was the direct outcome of our own refusalto negotiate, and  the &quot; Herald &quot;  seems apologetic for its earlier attitude, andextends the sympathy which it expresses for &quot; our own people,&quot; to Germans, French,and Austriaiis.   The &quot;Leeds Citizen &quot; fears that the &quot; huge advance &quot; has &quot; greatlyprolonged the war, if military victory is still the goal aimed at.&quot;     The  &quot; British  Citizen &quot; Continues to exult in the  glow of  combat, and, beforedescribing the steps which must be taken to set things right, sings its praises  to thecourage,  discipline, and leadership which characterised our defence.   &quot;Justice&apos;is more  pessimistic, though still resolute, and calls  upon the nation  to &quot; continue
 the struggle,&quot; and on the Labour Party &quot; to declare itself vigorously.&quot;   It fears muddle on the part of the Government, however, and refers to &quot; the awful slaughter of virile manhood&quot;&apos; now  proceeding.  The &quot;Clarion&quot;  angrily denounces these journalists  who have reflected on our leadership, but is otherwise confident.     The absence of military criticism proper is very noticeable, as is also the failure of several papers, which were last week very patriotic, to  deal with the subject at all, except  by means of oblique and carping references to such subjects  as man- power (dealt with in Part I).Foreign Affairs.     The  &quot;Herald &quot;  is  glad  that Japanese intervention in Siberia seems to have been dropped, and one or two papers, such as the &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot;  continue to express their faith in the Bolsheviks, who are also congratulated by the  &quot; British Citizen&quot; on their present determination to fight.  Attention is directed chiefly, however,  to  the Lichnowsky affair,  which is welcomed with enthusiasm by papers of  all shades of opinion.  The bourgeois papers of the type of the  &quot;Nation &quot; and &quot;New Statesman &quot; are chiefly concerned with the influence which the memorandum may be expected to have on public opinion in Germany.   There is a suggestion of disquiet on the part  of  the &quot;Herald,&quot; which fears lest the war  be prolonged,  but otherwise thinks that in its &quot;vindication &quot; of Sir Edward Grey &quot; the memorandum is entirely convincing.&quot;  The &quot;  Call &quot; is more hostile; fears that  the revelations may be  &quot; seized upon by those  who would still continue the conflict,&quot; and wishes that &quot; the futile  discussion were immediately ended.&apos;&apos;     The &quot; Clarion &quot;  welcomes the memorandum as exposing once and for all  the &quot; aggressive spirit&quot;  of the German^Government, a spirit which must be finally smashed.  &quot;Justice&quot; hopes  that the  memorandum will  finally settle all doubts which certain Socialists have  had regarding the origin of the war.   The &quot; British Citizen,&quot; while expressing its dislike of traitors, welcomes this &quot;most damningindictment of Germany&apos;s diabolical intentions.&quot;The &quot; Comb-Outr     Renewed interest has been displayed in the comb-out proposals, and the generalfeeling  as regards  both A.S.E.  and miners  is very optimistic.  The  &quot;Clarion,&quot;which originally took a strong line against the A.S.E., has become more moderate,and, after attributing a great deal of the  trouble to lack  of Government  pledgeson the dilution question,  expresses the opinion that there is a good  deal in this pointof  view.    The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;  contains  a  curious article by W.  F.Watson, the extremist shop steward leader, in which, after expressing  his  pleasurethat the threatened strike has been declared off, he regrets that the proposal  to striketwo months  ago  was  not adopted.  Incidentally he gives his opinion  against the&quot; dilutees first &quot; position  as  &quot; wrong absolutely.&quot;   The  &quot; New Age &quot;  is  morebitter than the others, and asserts its &quot; right to correct the Trade Union  movement.&quot;It is glad that &quot; Mr. Lloyd George spoke sharply to the dissenting miners,&quot; andpoints out that  if Labour begins to defy the Jaw,  it cannot expect capital to obeyLabour  legislation.   As  regards  the miners, the  &quot;Herald &quot; asserts  that they &quot;donot desire to avoid their share of fighting,&quot;  but nevertheless claims the result  ofthe ballot as &quot;the strongest moral condemnation of  the war  that has  been expressedhitherto by  organised Labour.&quot;   The pacifist &quot;South Wales Pioneer &quot; blames theinactivity of the local leaders, but also contains an article  by T.  C. Morris on therailwaymen,  in which he says that it would be &quot;criminally selfish, whilst support-ing the war, at the same time to be unwilling to contribute the wherewithal  to carryit on.&quot;Political Conferences.    All the I.L.P. papers  contain enthusiastic accounts of the  conference  held atNottingham during Easter.  They refer in terms of confidence to the rapid  growthof the Party, both in  numbers and influence, and are certain that the  success willbe continued.   The  opposition  papers,  such as  the &quot; Clarion &quot;  and &quot;  BritishCitizen,&quot;  refer to the conference in terms of great bitterness,  and the latter pro-duces statistics to prove that the membership of the I.L.P.  has in reality decreasedduring  the  war.  This paper also attacks  the &quot; swashbuckling British  Socialist
Part)&apos; &quot; Conference which was held at Leeds.  The &quot;Call,&quot; which is the organ ofthat party, asserts, however, that this conference was the most successful of thoseheld since the  commencement of the war.Food.     The  &quot;Clarion&quot; contains  the third and last of its excellent series of articles.on food control; in this it is pointed out that most of the present inconveniences aredue  directly to the war,  and not to State  intervention, which ought  not  to besaddled with them.  Beyond this, and the usual articles on the Consumers&apos; Council.there is little of interest on this subject.Pacifism.     The conferences of the B.S.P. and I.L.P. were paciiic in tone, and  the  partypapers are content to reproduce the speeches of their leaders.   Mr.  Snowdemsdemand  for the repudiation of  the secret treaties, and  the  opening up of  peacenegotiations, is welcomed particularly.    The  &quot;Herald&quot; adopts  a  very similarattitude as regards the secret  treaties,  and while admitting that the  outlook is insome respects unpromising,, is anxious for a peace based on grounds of reason, andafraid that an Allied victory  would be just as  disastrous as a German triumph.This paper is at pains1 to defend its support of a Lansdowne Government, on thegrounds that, while it  does  &quot;not like-his associates or his  domestic  politics,&quot; he&quot;offers a hope of peace.&quot;Trips to the Front.            &apos;.,     &quot; Justice &quot; contains the report of an interview with Mr. Greenwood of  theDockers&apos;  Union on his recent  visit to the front.   This  is entirely favourable tosuch visits, and  does  something to counteract the recent adverse article in  the&quot; Herald.&quot;                            III. DISTRICT REPORTS.London and South-E astern.     The situation  in this district continues to be quiet,  although  there is purelylocal unrest in some of the important works..  At Messrs. Cubitfs, for example, therehas been grumbling because a number of women have been turned  away from  oneworks almost  simultaneously with the  engagement of other women at a differentworks, and at Hendon there is discontent over the withdrawal of railway vouchersfrom single men and women by the Ministry, of Munitions.     Keen interest is displayed in  the proposals embodied in the new Man-PowerBill, but so far little unrest has been evident.  The shop stewards at Woolwich havebeen  advising  the  men  who receive calling-up notices  to present  themselves  formedical examination, but afterwards to return the forms with the intimation thatthey are awaiting  the outcome of the negotiations  between  the Government  andtheir Society.   It is reported from Willesden  that time  is being lost  through  theamount of conversation  devoted to the  new Bill, and that many men instead ofworking are seeking advice from  their union officials.     An  extremist demonstration  was held under the auspices of the  I.L.P.  andWorkers&apos; Suffrage Federation on the 4th.   The speaker, a South African Socialistnamed Andrews,&apos; in advocating an international conference, exhorted the workers tobring the industry of the country  to a standstill as a means of winning their pass-ports,West Midlands.     The position continues to be satisfactory, though the man-power proposals areattracting considerable  attention,  and in some cases hostility.  At  two importantworks,  Messrs.  Austin&apos;s and  the Wolseley Works, the  workers  are said to  bearranging demonstrations of protest, but their real grievance is said to be the allegedimmunity of &quot; fit Belgians from military service.&quot;   The increase in the number ofChinese workers employed in Birmingham is also a constant source of irritation.
    Several reports which have been received state that at the Austin Works, despiteprosecutions,  much  time  is  being lost  through  gambling,  which  is  becomingincreasingly prevalent owing to the efforts of ex-bookmakers employed in the works.Another frequent cause of lost time, which has been reported from other districtsalso, is the practice, still continued by many firms, of locking out men who arrive afew minutes late for the whole or half the day.  The men complain that under suchconditions they ought not to be so bitterly accused for losing time.    The annual meeting of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and CommercialEmployees was held at Birmingham during Easter.  Among other resolutions therewas carried one welcoming the Whitley Report and demanding the application ofits principles to co-operative employment.Yorkshire and East  Midlands.    The general situation  in  Yorkshire appears  to be much better.  The munitionworkers at Leeds are said to  be working solidly and  spending any  spare time onthere allotments, which are again being eagerly taken up.  The man-power proposalsare exciting considerable interest, but,  as  far as the engineers are concerned, theposition  appears to be satisfactory.    This  is especially the case  at Leeds andNottingham.  At Sheffield, which has been a centre of opposition, a mass meeting ofthe A.S.E.  held during Easter was exceedingly  badly  attended, and, though con-siderable resentment was  shown, no resolution  directly referring  to  the comb-outwas put to the meeting.    A meeting of the LLP. members of one of the branches of the  N.U.R. at  Leedsheld on Sunday passed without dissentients a resolution repudiating the speechesof Mr.  and Mrs. Snowden at Nottingham, and expressing their fullest support andhopes for a speedy victory to Mr. Lloyd George and the soldiers at  the front.   It isexpected that similar resolutions will be  placed before the other local branches of therailwayman.    There has been  some  complaint at Leeds of the  action of the  authorities inappealing to munition workers to forgo their holidays, while  hundreds of womencontinue to be discharged on the ground that  there is not work for them.North-W est em.    The political outlook as regards the earlier proposals for the comb-out lias con-tinued to be quiet, but no reports  have  been received  regarding the attitude of theworkers towards the more drastic measures which have now been brought forward.    At Manchester and Barrow the shop stewards have been keeping fairly  quiet,and at Liverpool the feeling prevailing among  the  men is reported  to be moresatisfactory  than for some time past,  Work was resumed very punctually after theholidays, and the  men  seemed glad to get back to  it.   Instructions have  beenreceived by local branches of the A.S.E. here from the Executive, in which they aredirected not to hold further meetings on the question of man-power.    In the Manchester district unrest  over the  extension of the 12i per cent, inthe building trade continues, and it is feared  that important work  may be held up.There is also a possibility  of  further trouble  at the Vulcan Works, Southport (seePart IV), but apart from this the industrial  position is quiet.North-Eastern.    Except  for continued difficulties over food supplies no reports of unrest in thisdistrict  have been received.South Wales.    The miners in South Wales have recently again been displaying a tendency tosporadic and apparently meaningless strikes.   These have so far however been ofshort duration; otherwise the situation continues  to be quiet.Scotland.    Comparative tranquillity  still prevails upon the Clyde, and  the  seriousness ofthe present situation appears to have impressed itself on the minds  of the men.  Asan example of their attitude is  quoted the action of electricians employed at  ParkheadForge who not only gave up their holiday, but resolved to contribute a day&apos;s pay tocharity in order to repudiate  the feeling that they are indifferent to  the sufferingsof the men in Prance.      [&quot;HOC- 241                                                      C
     On the other hand the  men intend to insist on the acceptance of the LabourParty&apos;s War Aims Memorandum by the Government in return for their agreementto the comb-out.  This and the  demand for an International Workers&apos; Conferencewere the substance of a resolution passed at the quarterly  meeting of the AS Eheld at Glasgow.  The new measure is also being watched  with keen attention  andthe proposals for the extension of the military age up to  55 are expected to causetrouble.  Hitherto the older men have been  chiefly responsible  for preventing theadoption of extremist measures, and it is feared locally that they will now come1 intoline with the younger men.     In this  connection a  statement by Clark,  a shop steward  leader, at  the  lastmeeting of the  Clyde Workers&apos;  Committee, which it may be noted is at present invery  low water, to  the effect  that the helplessness of that bodv was due to theattitude of the  older engineers is interesting.     The chief  opposition  to the comb-out so far experienced has been among theminers in Lanarkshire, where there have been several stoppages of work, and wherethe extremists are trying  to  engineer a general  stoppage^ for the 17th.   A ballot ofthe whole coalfield, which has however  just been concluded, resulted in a considerablemajority against a &quot; down tools&apos;&apos;  policy, and a still larger majority for  the men&apos;sorganisations participating in recruiting.                                   IV. DISPUTES.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.     The  industrial  situation  has  during the past  week  continued  to  be quiet,and, if coal-mining be excepted, strikes and disputes have been few in number andunimportant in character.     The Shipyard Labour Department reports three new cases of stoppage, involv-ing some 770 men.  Eighteen old  cases  are also referred to, but  of this total inseventeen cases  work has  already been resumed.            By far  the most serious of these  cases  was that  of 700  boilermakers  at Messrs.        Harland  and Wolff, Liverpool.  The  trouble arose  over the refusal  of a number of. men        to work under a charge-hand who had  been disrated by the District Committee  of  the        Boilermakers, and the others came out ha sympathy  on the 6th; but all returned  to work on        Monday, the 8th April, and the  charge-hand has sought other employment.    At Messrs.        Earle&apos;s Shipbuilding  Co,.  Hull, there was  a strike  of twenty squads of riveters due to a        claim for double rates for holiday work.  The men agreed to return to work on the 8th,  anil        were conceded the North-East Coast rates for this work.    No  settlement has yet been        effected in the case of the joiners at Harland and Wolff and Workman,  Clark, Belfast,  but        the men have arranged to consult the Ministry of Labour.   In  the meantime they remain        at work.     The Ministry of Munitions report is  the  most  satisfactory  which  has  beenreceived  for some time, only 647 men being involved  in the strikes reported for theweek ending the 3rd April.            Three strikes one of  joiners at Southampton over a question of  demarcation; another       . of optical  instrument-makers at Ealing over a reprimand from the  manager for &quot; slacking,&quot;        afterwards admitted to be unjustified; and  a third of  150 coke-oven  workers at  the Welsh        Navigation Collieries,  Tonyrefail-have been settled during the week.  This last case was        somewhat serious, and had not the men, who had struck in order to  enforce the dismissal        of a man who had remained at work during a previous  strike,  resumed work unconditionally        on the 7th, a prosecution would have been instituted.            A  strike of shipwrights at  Messrs. Summers and Payne,  Southampton,  took  place.        The men had tendered a- week&apos;s notice, which they desired to withdraw, but the  firm made        the reduction of piece prices a condition of  acceptance, and, on the men refusing to  agree.        locked them  out; but, under pressure from  the Ministry of Munitions,  they have taken back        the men.            The four men, whose recent  dismissal after their refusal to do certain work, from  the        Leeds  Ordnance Factory led to a  strike of  3,000 men,  have now apologised to the manage-        ment  and have been  reinstated&apos;.     The number of men involved in the twenty-two new cases of strikes reported bythe  Coal Controller is approximately 15,000. &apos; In seventeen of  these cases work hasalready been resumed, as  it has in the three old cases also referred to.            More  than half of these strikes occurred in the Lanarkshire district, and were largely        protest strikes against recruiting.  Several strikes  of this nature also  occurred in  the.        Yorkshire  district, and one in Durham.
            The strike at the Farme Colliery, Lanarkshire, came to an  end on the 8th, after the        Polish contractor,  whose attitude  towards  his men had caused the trouble,   had  been        deprived of his contract.  The strike at the Bedlay Colliery, Lanarkshire, which had been        in progress for nearly five months, has at last ended with the defeat of the extremist section.     No report has been received this week from the  War Office Contracts Depart-ment.(b.)  Not involving a Stoppage of Work.     The Ship)rard Labour Department has this week 24 new cases and 123  old casesof dispute to report.   As  34 of these cases have been settled during  the  week thenumber left over, viz., 113, is smaller than for some months past.            An important case has arisen  at Messrs. Beardmore and  Co., Glasgow,  where the        electricians have decided unanimously to cease working  under the premium  bonus system        set up in July 1916.   The firm  has  informed the men that the  times  will continue to be        fixed as hitherto, and  that where bonus  is earned  it will be paid.   The  stoppage of the        system is expected to have a serious effect on output, and efforts are being made to persuade        the men to withdraw their decision.     The Ministry of Munitions continues to report cases  of dispute arising out  ofthe 12^ per cent, bonus.            Difficulties are also arising in various quarters  over questions of dilution.   At Messrs.        Cox Bros.,  Dundee, labour in the engineering  shop was diluted in 1916, and again in 1917.        There has been a controversy over this ever since, but the A.S.E. have now taken up a firm        attitude,  and threaten to withdraw all then- members employed in jute mills in Dundee,        unless the  dilutees are removed.  Although the industry is controlled, they declare that        the work on which these men are engaged is commercial. There is  also, despite a dilution        agreement with their society, trouble among the boilermakers  employed by Messrs.  Booth        at Bolton.   The  firm  propose to  employ women and  discharged soldiers  on some  of the        simpler operations, but the men  declare that they will bring out all the  boilermakers on the        Mersey if this proposal is pressed.  Similar  trouble has arisen at Glasgow because the        British Hydraulic Foundry  Co.  replaced two skilled moulders by  unskilled men without        consulting the men or making any record of their action.            At Southport  there is the prospect of further trouble at the Vulcan Works,  where the        recent Murphy affair took place again over an alleged case of  victimisation.   Two women        were discharged after some  trouble with  a forewoman  on grounds of &apos;* slacking.&quot;  One of        them is a prominent shop stewardess,  and her case is  being  taken up by the  local shop        stewards, who have referred it to the National Council  at Manchester.     The  Coal  Controller  has  no new  cases  of  dispute  to  report  this  week,though ten cases  previously mentioned are  referred  to as still pending.     The Committee on Production heard 27 arbitration cases during the past week,14 in London and 13 in Scotland.            The  most noteworthy of these was a claim affecting Blackburn,  Darwen,  and Great        Harwood cotton employers for an advance of wages made on  behalf of mill engineers, boiler-        firemen,  ashwheelers,  oilers, and greasers.  The  dispute on which  this hearing  took place        had  been the subject of a proclamation  under the Munitions Act.     The number of new differences  referred to the Chief Industrial Commissionerduring the past week is 196.            Of this total somewhat less than half have been referred to arbitration.  In the engineer-        ing,  shipbuilding, and metal trades group, which again  furnishes about half  the total, thirty-        three of the cases arose out of the 12i per cent,  bonus.  The most  important of these was        a claim made by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation to a number of big shipping firms,        and it has  been referred to the Committee on Production.
