SECRET    ^Jhis Document is the Property of    JULgrltannlc Majesty^ Covftm^n^MILITARY   SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.         In view of the fact that I may not be able to bepresent at the Cabinet meetings when the Report of theMinisters1 Committee on the Man-Power proposals comes up fordiscussion, I may perhaps be allowed to make some observationson the Reports of the Proceedings of the Committee which Ihave had the advantage of reading.     (1).  TRIBUNALS.  I think that the modificationssuggested bv the Committee with respect to the work andfunctions of the Tribunals will make the proposals moreacceptable to Parliament.   With a view, however, to speedingup the work of the Tribunals and for the elimination, as faras possible, of parochial or interested considerations, Ithink the suggestion is worth examination that, say, twomembers of each Local Tribunal shall meet in groups in dailysession in a District Tribunal, so as to work off the mass ofcases within a short time.     (2)*  IRELAND,  (a).  It would appear that, on parliamen-tary grounds, the proposal that Ireland should be dealt within a special section of the Bill is preferable to its beingincluded within the general provisions of Clause 1.                     (b).  I think it would be impossible toextend the Bill to Ireland in any form unless the extension isaccompanied by a definite pledge to carry through Parliamentforthwith a Bill embodying the Majority Recommendations ofthe Convention setting up an All-I re land Parliament.                     (c.).  On the above understanding, Ibelieve/
believe that our people would much resent the extendedapplication of Military Service to this country withoutIreland being called upon to share.   With this feelingI heartily concur.                    (d).  In addition to hearing thestatement of the Chief Secretary and those of General Mahonand General Byrne, I have read the further statement ofGeneral Mahon on the Report of the Evidence of Sir EdwardCarson and Sir James Campbell, and I am still convincedthat, subject to the conditions indicated in paragraph (b),we are compelled, in view of national necessities, to extendthe operations of the Act to Ireland.   In the absence ofhearing the arguments for or against the proposal that theoperation of the Act to Ireland should be extended by Orderin Council, after a period for voluntary enlistment, asagainst extending It forthwith with power to set up appropriateTribunals, I am unable to express any opinion except that thefirst suggestion appears to present the advantage of providinga stimulus to recruiting whilst appropriate arrangements werebeing made to set up Tribunals and to get the machinerycreated that might ultimately be required.                    (e).  In giving the pledge indicated inparagraph (b), I think the House should be informed of theprincipal decisions of the Irish Convention Yfhich it isproposed forthwith to embody in the Irish Parliament Bill,with a view to making it clear what is involved in theundertaking given.                              CHRISTOPHER ADDISOK.                                       2nd April 1918.
