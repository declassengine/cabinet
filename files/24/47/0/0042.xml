Jf-llfZ  ;M;AOHMDUM TO THE WAR CABINET BY.^mR ALFRED mOND AND THE MEMBERS OF THEWAR CABINET CO^ilTTEE ON ACCOMMODATIONON TEE SUBJECT OF THE POWERS CONFERREDUNDER THE DEFENSE OF THE REAIii ACTS ANDREGULATIONS IN TEE ACQUISITION OF BUILDINGS,1,        The -uncertainty as to the extent of - le Powersconferred under the Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulationsis not only rendering the discharge of the Committeefs dutiess -nost difficult matter, bub is leading to serious delaysin the provision of urgent war accommodation.,2.        The Committee do not deal with purely Naval oriAilitary requirements? which are settled by  the Admiraltyand War Office respectively.  To nuch oases  the Powers underthe Defence of the Realm Aots and Regulations clearly apply.5,        The Committee deal with demands for accommodation inLondon, submitted to  them by H.M. Office of  Works,  Thesedemands cover the requirements of all Government Departments,both  those  established before and during the War, though inthe case of the War Departmentsj for administrative purposesonly.4,        i.iost of these  demands have to be met either within acomparatively short distance  from Whitehall  or in the immediateneighbourhood of existing  staffs housed away from &quot;Whitehall, so.  that in the majority  of  cases, the choice of premises isvery  limited. 5,         Further/ H,M.Office of Works have  a  quired  so much property  in London during  the war that very  little vacant &quot;office accommodation  now remains, with the result that demands can only  be met  by the  requisitioning of  occupied premises  or of  vacant  premises in those areas where the  restricted covenants  in  the head leases  prohibit use for  business purposes  unless  compulsorily  acquiredo Qe         Whereas maximum  prices have been fixed for  all of the principal  commodities  required  for Government purposes, none^has  been fixed  for property, and in  many  cases negotiations are impossible,  either on the ground of urgency, or of excessive cost, rj4         ^n.e following are instances where  the  legality  of exe^isine compulsory DOwers is questioned  by  the  Army Council,  who are the responsible authority  for requisitioning in these cases,  and will serve to  illustrate how tne  task of the committee will gradually become  impossible  to  perform without serious delay or the acceptance  of  unreasonable terms: -
       Ministry .^ Munitlong - Aircraft Production                                   Department.&apos;             Ac G oisjnr, flat ion  in Kings? way. - ,          This eo-heme involved the disturbance of anumber of business Firms P  (a) One of. the Firms, TheSpited Water Softeners&apos;.&apos; Lilted, he-dJho be  rehouseoTinrooms, in 1.tnioIhrs &quot;Trh FieXds 9 &quot;where1 the Landlords wsrasking an exorbitant rent.   The War Office  held  thatthey could not legally requisition the premises,  althcithe Firm was engaged on war work.    The owners have roagreed to submit the matter to an arbitrator,  but delaand expense is incurred.     (b)  Another Firm,            The Nopel&apos;s Explosives Company Lim.11ed,could only be renouVed&quot; suitably  in oertain&quot;/&quot;r&quot;em.:see,which could not be let for  business  purposes.-   The aacould not be further delayed, so that compulsory  powerhad to be &apos;exercised, though it might be held that thelegality of the proceedings was  doubtful&quot;.(it)    Mini, &amp; try of ^unltijtuis - Mechanical Warfare                               &quot;  u&quot;pplv&quot; ?ewarT^cni&quot;,              Additional accommodations     This could only be provided by the removal of theCanadian. Red Cress Sooletv.   The uncertainty as  towhether compulsory powers could be  exercised in rehousthem delayed the provision of the additional accommodswhich was most urgently required.(ill)   Ministry of Pensions. .     The Ministry of Pensions are continually makingdemands for large amounts of accommodation  required bythe extension of their work.   The War office are legaadvised, that the powers conferred under the Defence cfthe Realm Acts and Regulations cannot be rightly  applifor this service, though, having been press eel toreconsider the matter, they now state that  in the lastresort they would be prepared to requisition, i.e.., ifagreement for hiring can  be arrived at.   The conductsuch negotiations.- however, before it could be definit stated that agreement was impossible, might lead toconsiderable delays, ana  seriously hamper the work ofMinistry of Fens ions.-.Be     The Committee are unanimously of opinion that they can:continue to carry put the work committed to them by the WarCabinet unless compulsory cowers can be exorcised in theacquirement of premises; not only t;for the purpose of securing&quot;the public safety or the Defence of the Realm5&apos; as laid downRegulation^ 2 (f) of the Defence of the Realm  (Consolidated)Regulations, 1914; but also for:-
 (a) The acquisition of premises for the accommodation of -:.li Government staffos including -staffs of Allied arid American Governments5 and of alii organj.sat.ions engaged in work connected with the war- (b) The rehousing of Governmeynt staffs not directly engaged on war work, whose premises are required for staffs who are directly engaged on war- work, (c) The rehousing of &quot;business Firms whcce premises are requisitioned for Government -staffs engaged in- connection-with the ware9/.        The question of compensation to be awarded in suchcases in respect of loss or damage to property or businessoccasioned by the exercd.se of compulsory powers to be referredto the Royal Commission of Inquiry dated 31st March, 1918.          The Committee would, therefore urge the War Cabinetto authorise the suggested extension of Powers conferred underthe Defence of the Realm Acts and Regulations,r5 APR 1918
