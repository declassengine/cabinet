NOTES OP A CONFESENCB AT 10 DOWNING STREET.               S.u. , OH WEDNESDAY,  APRIL 10, 1918, AT               IE.45 p.m.                        Present: -               The  k-t.  Hon.  D. Lloyd George,                Prime Minister (in the  Chair).               The  Rt.  Hon.  Viscount Llilner, G.C.B., G.C/1..G.,               Ma j o r- Gene ral P.B. Maur ic e, LC.H.3;., C. 3.,                Director of  Military Operations:               Major-General Sir R.D.V3%ham, K.CB., D.s.0.,                Deputy  Chief of the Imperial General Staff:               Sir  Sam  Pay,                Director of  Movements:               Lieutenant-Colonel oir M.P.A.Harikey, .d.C.B. ,                Secretary, ilar Cabinet.        THE :&apos;RRIV;.L OP ^ERICAS FORCE3.   GSBERAL WHIGHAM said that the American troops could be consider-ed under two headings:-           (1) Those arriving in Lngland:           (Z) Those arriving in Prance.  .In regard to the first category, those arriving in England consisted of the Illrd American Army Corps.  They were intended to con-sis t entirely of infantry with machine-guns, but the first divisiondue to arrive, namely, the 77th, would also bring its artillery andother units.  The reason for this vras that the whole of the divi-sion had been concentrated in the camps at the ports of embarkation,and the shortest way to clear those oamps for other infantry and toutilise the available transport had been to bring the whole division.He hoped that we should obtain in all,during ,.pril, 60,000 American                               1.
troops, of whoa about 48,000 would consist of infantry.   &apos;Vith regard to the second category, those arriving now consistedof troops of the II. American Army Corps,  Fragments of this oorpa(3rd, 5th, and 93rd divisions) were constantly coming over.  It wassot known at present, however, whether the troops now being des-patched to France were in continuation of General Pershin^e mil-itary programme, or whether this was being suspended and infantryonly being Bent,        QEKBRAL THIGHAM undertook to ascertain from the United        States of America which course was now being followed,         AMERICA TROOPS IF PRAJ-C5 -1*D GRgA? BRITAIN,   G2K2RAL WHIGHAM said that at present General Persuing had, inFrance, the 1st American Amy Corps, consisting of 4 fighting andZ replacement divisions.  One replacement division was being equip-ped to become a fighting division, so that very shortly the Americanswould have 5 divisions in the fighting line,   The ration strength of the American forces in France was 519,000,the combatant strength was 214,000, but these included at  the pres-ent moment only about 70,000 infantry for the fighting line.  Thefigures of ration strength included 3,677 engineers and railwaytroops with our Army, although  the numbers would reach a total ot4,800 with the British Array if  sanitary troops were included.   In the United Kingdom there  were about 10,000 American  troopsat this moment, consisting of various fragments of General Pershing&apos;emilitary programme,  ?hese 10,000 included about three-quarters ofone battalion, but otherwise was composed of portions of units,   GENERAL MAURICE mentioned that several complete battalions ofGeneral Pershing&apos;s lind Army Corps had arrived in France.  He andGENERAL WHIGHAM suggested that pressure might be applied on GeneralPershing, either directly or through President Ulson, to allowthese battalions to be incorporated in the British Army, partlyin order to meet the need of the immediate situation, and partlyin erdef to get a start with the new scheme,   THS PRI2*S MINISTER and LORD HTLNEE thought that it was unlikelythat General Pershing would consent to part with these troops except                                 Z.
under orders from the President, and that, for the moment, it wemfr&quot;fee better to reserve such influence as we might hare with PresidentWilson Szl invorder to ensure the adoption of the larger scheme forthe gradual incorporation of 480,000 American troops in Britishbrigades.  To press for the immediate incorporation of a few bat-talions might have the effect of weakening our prsssure*fox.. thelarger scheme.              It was, therefore, decided to ta^ia^nn,              action for the moment.                i                iMERIOAB gAYAL EEIffPOROS&amp;SNTS.   GENERAL MAURICE said that Admiral Sims had^nftjrmad liim  thatthere were 7,000 men under the orders of the United States JBary  on-this side of the Atlantic.  Admiral Sims had offered to put theseforces at the disposal of our Military Authorities, provided thathis Government consented.  The Admiral had informed him that he  hadnow received the consent of his Government, and he was in communi-cation with  the preneh Government with a view to their release fromcertain coastal and other duties-in which they were at present em-ployed on the Prench coast.  They were not trained as fighting men,but would be available as labour.                       TRANSPORT ARRANGEMENTS.   SIR SAM PAY mentioned that he had received a telephone messageto the effect that the United States Authorities had declined toallow 4 British ships in American ports to be used as transports onthe ground that their speed was less than 12-J- knots, and  that thedanger from  submarine attack was, therefore,  too great  to  justifytheir use.   SIR MAURICE HAN2EY undertook to go into this matter at once   with  the  Ministry of Shipping and to ascertain  the facts, x2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,    April 10, 1918.x Note by Sir Maurice Hankey:  The result of the inquiries is givenin the attached Minute to the Prime Minister.
