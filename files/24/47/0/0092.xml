\JB EC RE T. G.T.- 4190.     PASSPORTS FOR INDIAN H0M1. RULE DELEGATES.Copy of a Minute from Lord Islington tc thePrime Iwinister,blegramjlegram .2.          The attached telegrams from the Viceroy appear tome to require very early consideration by the v/ar Cabinet.          Briefly the facts are these:-   On 9th March 6tho Government of India telegraphed that Tilak and certainother Home Rule and Congress delegates, some of whom holdextreme views, were starting for England, but that theydid not consider it expedient to withhold passports in anyinstance.     On 21st March *  the Government of Indiaagain telegraphed that five delegates had already sailed,and that Tilak&apos;s party would leave on 5th April.   They saidthat &quot;from their point of view it would be a mistake torefuse passports, but some of these people may have tc bewatched and possibly Military or other authorities may regardtheir presence in England as objeotionabie or dangerous.&quot;They added that they would be glad to receive as early aspossible any guidance that the Home Government might wish togive.      Copies of these telegrams are attached.          The India Office eprnraunlccitad these  telegrams to    Horn:. Office cmd the 3.1.1,1. cud proposed not to obj.ct topassports b ing gr^v 4.    -  &apos;Th          On the 2nd April the India 0?V*ce was informed thatthe War Cabinet had agreed to action 1eing taken as in the  *last para, of a memorandum on the subject laid before themby the General Staff.          Th&amp;t para, with the paragraph immediatelypreceding it, are as follows:-          *0ne party consisting of fire of these delegates   sailed on the 21st March.  Tilak*s party is proposing to   start on the 5th April and others are to follow, some of   whom intend to go to Ireland.  The Government of India   from their point of view consider it inexpedient to withf   hold passports but ask for guidance,  realising that the   presence of Buch people in the United Kingdom may be   oonsidered dangerous by the Military Authorities,   The   India Office propose to agree that passports should not &quot;be   refused counting on the Home Office and the War Office te   take any strong action against individuals that may be   deemed necessary.&quot;          &quot;I regard this proposal as open to strong objection,   I am of opinion that no exception should be made in these   cases to the general rule, which is,  that leave to travel   should be refused to persons whose journey does not subserve   some Imperial interest,.  I recommend that neither TilaJt^e   party nor any similar party should be allowed to leave   India, and that th/)SG -&quot;ho have already left should, if   possible, be stooped and sent back.&quot;
          Had I been invited to attend the meeting at  whichthe General Staffs Minute was discussed,  I should havepointed out the very awkward position in which the Govern-ment of India would be placed if instructed to recall  atthe eleventh hour the passports that had been issued,  andto stop a deputation that had excited very great  puhlicinterest and was regarded by the Indian Rationalist partyas a strictly constitutional proceeding.   There  is anotherpoint of some importance that Tilak&apos;s visit to this countryhas reference also to the libel action which he has broughtagainst Sir Valentino cnirol and which iB said to be readyfor trial.    The recall of his passport will be interpretedin India as a political move on the part of Sir ValentineChirol&apos;s friends to delay proceedings in the Law  Courtsthat he has good reason to dislike.          It is unfortunate that the consideration on  whichthe Government of India acted were not adequately-stated  inthe earlier telegrams of the Government of India,  ana  haveonly now been elicited.   It is also unfortunate  that-thetelegrams created the impression that the question was rather.an open one, that the Government of India were not veryconfident that they had done right in granting passports,,and that they would be glad of a lead.(Sd.)

Var Cabinet,  on  the motion, of theGeneral iAbaff, decided today that passports should bo refusedin all cases and that the  party which lias  already  started  shouldbo turned back in Agypt.   Tho present critical time  requires that-.holc energies of civil population should  be concentrated  on workessential to the prosecution of tho  war and not distracted byviolent inflammatory propaganda.   Tho closest continuoussupervision over delegates  would bo  necessary, and osperiencehere and in Ireland has shown that tho task cannot be dischargedsuccessfully by a police reduced to  half its strength.Recommend you should adopt  rule of practice established here torefuse passports to leave  tho country except on evidence thatjourney is for some Imperial object  or cogent private necessity.war Office is sending necessary instructions to -wgypt.

Ia.ilitaryauthorities  had made up their minds that the movements ofthese men must bo restricted under Defence of tho RealmRegulation^14 if they wore permitted to reach this country.This might &quot;have provoked at least as much resentment inIndia as c. veto on their journey and might also havo arousedconsiderable  opposition in this country.                              (5).Jrom Viceroy to secretary of state dated 6th *epril,  1918,Irivatc,   Your private telegram of the 3rd instant,Home Rule and Congress delegates,   The orders  conveyed  in  yourofficial telegram of 2nd .*pril have proved highly  embarrassingparticularly in regard to Tilak and party v.-ho arc  duo to leaveColombo today (5th) sailing via Cape,     I cannot deny that Homo Department telegram addressed  toyou on the 21st -larch contains full justification  for the attitudenow adopted by the ear Cabinet but I feel this  telegram  failed  topresent certain important aspects of the case,   I am convincedIndian extremist politicians eill receive a rude av/akening  oncontact with existing home conditions,   iit present they labourunder the delusion that enthusiastio welcome and support await  them,A, view of England under ear conditions amidst which thoir llissionis surf; to fail flat will have most salutary of foot,   I  amsatisfied that they will not attempt any dangerous intrigue as  theironly chance is to come out into the open and I  therefore do notthink they will require any special police ourveillaneo,    In anycase (reference to your private telegram 3rd *.pril) I see noobjection to such restrictions being imposed undor the Defence  ofthe Realm . .ct as night be found necessary exempli  gratia withrefcronoo to Ireland.     Contrast this *,.ith tho position wc shall bo brought upagainst out here if Tilak and party aro taken off  their  ship afterbe-ing furnished with passports by Government of India,   Tilak hashad a \/oll stage -managed send-off and if he now returns  to  stumpthe country as a martyr the possibility of rallying the  kodoratesto tho support of the Reform scheme will be gravely jeopardised,     I am fully prepared to enforce orders of the  &quot;ar   Cabinetas regards other political emissaries whether pro  or ante Home  Rulo;but in view of urgent considerations above-stated  and of fact thatTilak in connection with his lawsuit can put forward a legitimateand Irresistible claim for passport I trust you will exert  strongestefforts to secure a reconsideration of orders in regard  to  Tilak andthe party accompanying him.   In tho meantime I havo telegraphed toCeylon authorising Tilak end party proceeding to 0 .pe on the groundthat reference has been aacle to H,L.trOvcrnmont  and on tho strictun&amp;orstBn&amp;iiig that they accept risk of being turned back from thefirst port of c-11,                               (6).?rom Viceroy  to  eocrotary of state,  dated 6th April,  1918*-livato.

HrsrA23nieBesanlTand MrTSanga Swam:.adcLvess&quot;ea to&apos; the Prime Minister.;Despatched from&quot;Hadras.&quot; Rr/eeived April&quot; 3th,&quot;&quot;1918.      The people of India have learnt with pain and indignationof the action of the Home Government in cancelling the passportsof the Homo Rule deputation under the leadership of Mr.Tilak,That deputation was intended to put before the British public theclaims of India to self-government.   They view with grave ccn-corn this surrender on the part of the Imperial Government tothose reactionary influences which are active in destroying thegood relations between this country and Britain at a time whenthe Empire is engaged in a most vital struggle for existence.They regard it as nothing short of disastrous that any actionshould be taken so gravely affecting tho public tranquility ofIndia and have  confidence in this country fraught with greatperil for the good relations between India and Britain.   TheIndian people regard the action taken against their most trustedleader as indicating an attitude of suspicion of their loyaltywhich belies the professions of goodwill and confidence so oftenexpressed by the:  Premier and other British statesmen.   Theyparticularly resent the manner in which at the last moment thedeputation was treated and was thus the necessary corollary tothe visit of ...r.Montagu to this country.   It was also intendedto expose the shameful falsehoods circulated by Lord Sydenhamand his followers and it is unjust while allowing Indians to beblackened to prevent them from defending themselves by preventingthe deputation proceeding to England,   The excellent effectproduced by   Montagu1s visits are likely tc bo entirely destroyed-The action has produced a situation (-? word omitted) the goodwilland sense of justice of $rent Britain.   They pray therefore thatthe action may be rescinded and the deputation allowed to proceedon E mission which has behind it the sanction of the vast majorityof the people of this country,                           (Signed) SUBRiuXAMIXA AIYAR                                   AIJHIE ESSAifT                                   BAHOA SV&amp;MI.
