I 0 RET,                         WAR    0 A B  I i\T 33  ff.J!.- 4133,                         -&quot;**-                  COMPULSORY  SaRVIGE   Uf  IRELAND.                   Memorandum by  the Chief secretary.     (The proposal  to  introduce  compulsory military service  in Ireland raises numerous  grave questions  and among others these 1*   Will Parliament  consent to place  further burdens  of servioe on the British population  without  requiring service  from Ireland  ? 09   Will Parliament  entertain  any proposal for  giving self-govern- ment to Ireland without  requiring  such service ? 3*   Will Parliament  consent to require  compulsory service  in Ireland notwithstanding  the resistance of the  Nationalist members and poesiblo resistance  of the  people  of Ireland ? 4*   If Parliament approves oan the necessary  service  be  obtained ? 5*   If obtained will they bo of military value  ? 68   Is there anything contrary to the spirit  of our relations with the Allies and the self-governing Dominions in the proposal ? 7*   If Ireland is to bo included  in the  obligations of  service, are there any obvious or practicable means  of minimising the difficulty of carrying it  into  effect  ?     Question (1) it  is thought by very  many politicians must be &amp;&amp;^$K*t  to tne negative^     To Question (8)  I believe  tho great  majority  of responsiblersona.fo$$&amp;  . answer promptly in the  negative.    It is important because there is serious future  risk in  a failure to deal now withthe matter of Irish self-government.   Involved  in this subject are considerations which may be  vital to  the future  fortunes of Creat Britain and the Empire,    If this  is  a sound opinion,  then rejection of the proposal  for compulsory  military service in Ireland may involve the abandonment of all  hope  of a settlement in Ireland during the War,  and  leave the  difficulty  in our way, for good or evil, now and hereafter,     As to (3) the will of Parliament may depend perhaps upon itsview of all the other questions  involved, - subject to thisthat if service could bo introduced under conditions which remove /any inherent objection to tho treatment on an even footing of   /all tho people of the United Kingdoms,  tho extent of the publicneed and tho practicability of  the undertaking wouldbe
be more fairly weighed than  if the proposal were  &amp; mere proposalto introduce consorlption before  the  outstanding.  *iXaim*L of  theNationalists - in some measure already  admitted fry the AAgisXatrrr^were being passed by  ,   On  the whole I think  It  likely that  ifParliament were able  and willing  to undertake  the extension of anacceptable system of  8elf-government  to Ireland Members wouldbe inclined to. exact  at  the  same  time recognition of  the.duty ofMilitary Service.   If both  Houses should  accept  the  principleof a settlement on the lines  of the Convention F.e solutions, thatmight be a sufficiently  preliminary concession in point of  reasonto warrant Conscript! on.   If the Government  is to be guaranteeof the intentions of  the country  in this respect, perhaps theproper way to make its guarantee  in some degree acceptable  totho Irish would be that  it should reserve  control of  the  timewhen - consistently with performance  of the conditions precedentof Irish self-government - the obligation  for  Irish submissionto compulsory military service could  favourably be enforced.Shortly, I believe Parliament woiild be  more likely to acceptcompulsory service for Ireland if the principle of self-governmentfor Ireland were first established.     Question (4) seems  to me to  be one for the Military  Authoritiesand the police.  I believe the true answer to  be  that if  wise meansare taken, the necessary levies can be  obtained.     TJhether (question 5) the conscripts would be of  militaryvalue is to ay mind a question of degree.   I  have been greatlyprejudiced against the * class  likoly to  be  enrolled by many  monthsof unpleasant experience of their capacity for causing trouble inIreland.     Question (&amp;) is  one of pure politics, which  I cannot usefullydiscuss,     As to (7) I think there  are preliminary measures by  which thedifficulties involved in this  business  could bo  diminished.   Wehave to remember (a)  that Great Britain did not come  at one stepto the acceptance of  Conscription; (b)  that Irish opinion ispractically solid against Conscription  now; (c) that  the  agenciesof the Sinn Fein Combination  are directed  particularly towardthe prevention of Conscription; fd) that there is no  completeRegister of National  Service  in Ireland; aie (e)  that no help canbe got from popularly chosen  local tribunals.   The sudden  extensionof the Military Service  Acts  to Ireland wjuld  impose  on theGovernment a necessary obligation to proceed at once  with moasuresfor putting the law into effective operation.  Any hesitation undersuch circumstances might involve very grave consequences -  andsudden action would be not unlikely to  result  in  outbreaks  ofrebellion in various  quarters.     Regarding the whole situation,as I do with misgivings, I thinkthe line of least danger would be that  of  shewing the main policyof the Government as  to  Ireland to be the grant of such a measureof self-government as the majority of the Convention have agreedto propose, and so far as Military Service is  concerned,  to treatit as a necessity of  the crisis which must be  dealt with in theway best calculated to ensure the fullest possible contribution of
man-power from Ireland.   This view of the matter is, I think,most likely to he met by embodying in the Military Service- Act,a section emp-owerlng His Majesty to extend-the system withmodifications to Ireland, to postpone saoh extensions, until anIrish Government Act is accepted in principle by both Houses ofParliament, and to occupy the interval in preparing in Irelandfor compulsory service and enrolling by means of all possiblehonest inducements the recruits whom speeial conditions as tochoice of corps, conditions of training, or otherwise, may helpto bring to the Colours.
