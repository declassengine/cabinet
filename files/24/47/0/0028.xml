Headquarters,                                      Parkgate,                                         DUBLIN. PRIVATE.                                      April 2nd, 1913cMy dear  Prime Minister,      I  hope you will  forgive my making a suggestion.      If it is decided to have conscription in  this  country,might  it not he a good plan to consider  forming an Irish       iArmy, this would put Ireland on the same footing as ourColonies and would smooth National sentiment.  The hitterfeeling  that is held by so many of being compelled to fightin &quot;England1s Army&quot; would be avoided by doing this.      I  fancy if the people realized they were being conscriptedfor an Irish Army much of the sting would be removed andeven enthusiasm might  result, in any case it would material?&quot;assist the loyal people to come forward end help,and a farbetter spirit would exist generally both during and afterconscription.      The remnants of  the Irish Divisions (2) might be recalledfrom France and together with the Reserve Irish Regiments nowat home  be formed into a nucleus in England  upon which theArmy would be built.      I believe that such an Army tactfully officered ^ndliberally supplied with RoC. Chaplains would be both loyaland successful.      Agai-: apologising for troubling you.                             Yours very sincerely,                                   (Sgd) B. MAHOH.
