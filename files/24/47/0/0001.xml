3   C it E f.ft, T,--4101.APPLICATION OF C0MHJL30RY MILITARY SSRVIC3 TO IR3LAKD.Memorandum by the Lord Chief Juetico for Ireland.     It is safe to assume that the application of compulsorymilitary servioo in Ireland would raise a forces of at least150,000, allowing upon a most liberal scale for exemptions.The smsllest contribution to this total would naturallycome from the Province of Ulster owing to the response ithas already made to voluntary enlistment and probably30,000 would bo the maximum of its contribution.  If however,on the ground of emergency, it was deemed  advisable to compelts enlistment all males -within the prescribed ages who uponexamination were found t* be physically fit, I am satisfiedthe total vvould fall little, if at sll, short of 250,000.Locnl tribunals such as were established in En^la^d would beimpracticable here as they would be subject to local pressureand intimidation in varying forms.  Iho Resident Magistrateswould be available for the purpose but I would not reoommendtheir employment as it would make them the direct agents ofthe Executive 3nd impair their utility and authority in theexecution of their ordinary magisterial functions in theirseveral districts and if exemption tribunals are consideredto be an essential part, of the machinery, I would recommendthe selection for this purpose of competent barristers ofsome years standing who could be relied upon for firmnessand coramonsense.   I em strongly of opinion *ilso that itwould be unwise to attempt to enforce enlistment piece-mealor by taking the Provinces or Counties separately.  It wouldresult in the same outcry while it would largely defoat its ownobject  .s it would excite, at le&amp;st, the attempt to stampedefrom the Provinces or Counties adjoining those attacked, in thebelief that their turn was approaching and would also, I foelcertain, induce many to entrench themselves in various otrong-holds with a view to combined resistance.  The policy itselfwould in my opinion ar. use the fiercest hostility in manyagricultural districts in Ulster while the opposition to itthroughout the other three Provinces would be oven creatsrand substantially general.   The Roman Catholic Hierarohyand Clergy, and the official Nationalist Party would beneither willing nor able to support it while the Local Bodiessuch as Corporations, County and District Councils and theentire force of Sinn Fein would unsparingly denounce it,  Theloyal &amp;*tionalists would be compelled to swell the chorus,through fear of their neighbours and of injury and loss intheir business.  At no time since the outbreak of the warwere the conditions more unfavourable for the experimentmainly es the result of the impunity which sedition and opendefiance of the law have enjoyed since that date and moreespecially since the rebellion of faster 1916.  Owing alsoto the difficulties in the way, the number of emigrants fromIreland for the four years 1914 to 1917 inclusive hsfjs  fallen  -
SB ***from the figure of 120,000 for four years in normal timesto 40,000, s difference of 80,000, of whom 30,000 wouldprobably be males of military ago, who foel that theyhave an addec&apos; grievance In being prevented from leavingIreland.   My personal opinion is that consoription wouldhave been comparatively easy immediately after therebellion because the defeated rebels would at the tiraohave regarded 1-t as an avenue of escape from the heavierpunfehraent which they anticipated as the result of theirtreason but in the light of their treatment and the speedyrelease of all who were at first      made amenable, theyhave come to believe that conscription was the merest bogeyand ridicule the slightest suggestion of it.  Further at thgttime their number was comparatively small but h*s sincoincreased by leaps and bounds and the oinn ?ein movement is.in my experience, gathering strength throughout Ireland fromday to day.  A now bnd dungorous feature in its growth is thetype and character of its adherents 8 8 to 3 very large extentit has attracted to its rank:.  Men with &amp; certain positionand education, especially in the Towns, such bs olerks, shopassistants, school teachers,  subordinate officials in PublicDepartments eto.f end these men are, I am satisfied frompersonal observation, idealists prepared and willing to under-go any sacrifice for the policy they advocate.   They aremainly young men and with&apos;a new parliamentary register arecertain to win many more seats at the next General Election.They have been singularly successful in guarding their ownsecrets, for while I do not know the position in this respectat present, it is certain tnere was little or no leakagebefore or at the date of the  rebellion.  Pinelly I am convincedthat whether you take the number to bo obtained as 250,000,without exemptions or 150,000 with exemptione,  the bulk ineither case will consist of pronounced Sinn Feiners.   TheNationalist M52&apos;s declare from the olatforms from day to daythat this new agitation has only gained over the youth of thecountry and that a large proportion even of them have onlyjoined it through fear of conscription.  The first statementis I think undoubted while there is considerable  truth in thelatter, but taken together  they bear out my contention thatthe conscripts would in the me:in be disloyal.   They will onlybe recruited, in my belieft  after grave disorder and bloodshedin many places but even if this can be obviated by a displayof military strength I view with grave apprehension tho intro-duction into our military system of men whose loyalty andallegiance cannot be relied upon and who mi;/nt end I fesrwould prove false in the dsy  of aan;:.or.  It is of coursepossible that they might be used for home defence in  n^landand Scotland ;;nu thereby release others &amp;r active servicebut there are manifest dangers  even in such a oourso and Icannot recommend it rs worth  the risk.
