(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 585).To The Prime  Linister :     Ovcing to the  notice of SaturdayTs Cabinet heeting only reach-ing ray Office an  hoar before the lieeting,  I was unfortunatelyunable to  attend.2,   I have very parefully read the draft hinutes of the prcoeed-ings as well as the letter of x.ord Robert Gecil to the PrimeMinister referred to therein (G.T. 4166 )ft   The only reason whiohenables me to agree to the application of conscription to  Irelandwithout the consent of an Irish Legislature ia that of the para-mount military necessity.   I understand that when this questionwas discussed formerly the authorities in Ireland as well  as herewere agreed that the probable yield of men for the xrmy by enforc-ing conscription in Ireland would not offer a military advantagecommensurate with the disturbances likely to occur if such aoourse were pursued.   I must assume that the \ar Cabinet hassatisfied itself that these considerations no longer hold good inthe present situation,  and that the grave and serious risk whichmust be involved in taking such a step is necessitated by thepresent man-power position.   If this is the case, the policy asproposed in the draft Bill of not dealing with conscription InIreland immediately but obtaining powers for an Order in Councilto be exercised at borne indefinite period seems to me open tovery grave objections.    The whole opposition to the principlewill have to be faced now and the time for agitation in opposit-ion \-.Till be prolonged while there will be serious delay in obtain-ing the men required for the Army,   An impression will be createdin the  Country that the proposal ib not a serious one and that itis merely meant to sweeten the pill of raising the age limit andcombing out more severely men of the younger ages.   There is,therefore,  serious risk of falling between two btools,  that is,getting no backing in the United Zingdom while having to meet thefierce  opposition of nationalist and binn Pein elements.    It doesnot appear to me practicable to make the enforcement of conscrip-tion coincident with the passing of a Home Pule 3ill.   The twomay be  declared as simultaneous policies but it is obvious that aHome Rule Bill on the lines of the Convention Report even withgeneral assent will consume a very considerable amount of Parlio-mentary time.     Again, in view of the opinion expressed by the  Conventionitsoif on page 5 of the Memorandum G.T. 4105 that &quot;it seems adirect  consequence of the creation of an Irish Parliament that anymeasure of this character must be submitted to the Irish  Parliamentboforo  it could be enforced on Ireland&quot;,  it will be  very  difficultto bring into operation conscription for Ireland after the  HomeKule Bill is passed until the Irish Parliament has an opportunityof dealing with the subject.   Tho answer of extreme urgency whichcan &quot;be  given now to the claim for conscription will  have  passedaway.     I would, therefore, conclude by urging that(1) The application of conscription to Ireland,  if it is  to beapplied shall be applied immediately.,
(2),   rfho Government  should  simultaneously promise to introducea Home Rule Bill on the  lines of the  Koport of the Convention aidtho iluiikctt letter and  pledge  itself either to pass this Bill intolaw with all possible  speed or  to  resign from Office.(Signed), alPRuD 1IOH3).Office of Porxs.
