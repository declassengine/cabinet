When the peace with the Ukraine seemed to be coming, a curious reversal  of the positions of the Government Socialists and the Independent Socialists took  place.  Hitherto the Independents had been the pre-eminently pacifist body, and they habitually  blamed the Government Socialists for helping the Government to carry on war;  now it  was the Independents who were adverse to the peace negotiations and the Government  Socialists who applauded.  It was the same in  the case  of the  negotiations  with the  Russian Bolsheviks.  Here, indeed, the position  was even more complicated.   So far as  the general theories of society held by the Bolsheviks went, they were calculated  to be  much more obnoxious to the Government Socialists than  to the  Independents : on the  other hand,  so far as the Bolsheviks were disposed to conclude a separate peace  with  the Central  Powers, they were obnoxious to the  Independents and favourably regarded  by the Government Socialists.  Hence  the  strange inconsistencies  of utterance.-  The  tone of the Independent leaders, such as  Kantsky, and  of the official organ  of the  Independents, the &quot;Leipziger Volks-Zeitung,&quot; was, generally speaking, till lately strongly  opposed to the Bolsheviks.       On the other hand, they were read)7 to defend the internal action of the Bolsheviks  against critics of the Government Socialist party.  One  Independent leader, Ledebour,  asserted in the Reichstag that the Bolsheviks in  Russia held a corresponding position to  his  own Independent  Socialist party in Germany.  The Chemnitz  branch of the  Independents  and the organ of the  Solingen Independents  protested against  the  unfriendly tone adopted towards the Bolsheviks  by the &quot; Leipziger Volks-Zeitung &quot; and  other Independent papers.   There was a similar  inconsistency on the side of the Govern-  ment Socialists.  Sometimes they held up the  doings of the Bolsheviks in Russia to  execration, &apos;:a rule of pure brute force&apos;&apos; (Enemy Press Supplement for  14th  February,  p. 659),  a warning which  should  make  the German working class shy of extreme  revolutionary movements ; sometimes they spoke sympathetically of the Bolsheviks and  attacked the Independents, who spoke disparagingly of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations  for their &quot; sabotage &quot; of efforts towards peace.       Even the Government Socialists, however, expressed anxiety lest the German  Government,&quot;under pressure from the annexationists, should impose terms upon Russia  inconsistent with  the July resolution  of the Reichstag majority, and when  the  peace  was finally concluded, both Socialist  parties declared  aloud that it was just such a  peace as they  had feared.   The Government plea that  the provinces  detached  from  Russia were detached by their own will  was,  the Social Democrats affirmed, a mere  pretence.  The peace was cynically annexationist.   As far, therefore, as words go, the  Government Socialists are  brave enough.   But  it is  no  new thing for the German  Socialists to use strong words and be nerveless  in action.   It is apparently  to be so  here. Having said that the peace is one  which  they they do not approve, the Govern-  ment Socialists feel that they have done their duty.  They goon to intimate  that  they  will bow to  the brutal  fact, and do  not intend  to embarrass the Government in the  prosecution  of the war.  After all, they say, it is the fault of the Bolsheviks themselves  if they have fallen victims to German militarism.  We actually find that  two^ Social  Democrats, Noske and David, are associated with extreme Conservative annexationists,  like  Westarp  and Rdsicke, in a newly-formed  &quot; German-Lithuanian Society,&quot;  which  aims at giving good advice to the Lithuanians under the new conditions, and has been  promised the support  of the ;Government  and  the military high command  (&quot; Inter-  nationale Korrespondenz:&apos; for the 7th February).       In fact, it is  not likely  that the  Social Democrat  leaders can easily  dissociate  themselves in  heart  from &quot;the great  mass of people,  who take a natural  pride in  Germanys triumph  over the  Eastern enemy, and.welcome the  peace a.s breaking the        [367]                                                             B10
 painful  economic  blockade.  Harden, in  a  recent  article, includes &quot; the  leaders  of Labour &quot; amongst those who &quot; back the decision  of the Government either  noisily  or stealthily.  &apos;&quot;&apos; If the Russians will stand it,&quot; they say, &quot; why not ? &quot;*     In home politics Prussian electoral reform is still the dominant  issue of the hour. But since, in spite of the check in Committee, there is now a reasonable hope that the Government will eventually carry through the principle of equal suffrage, the attitude of the Social Democrats can afford for the present to be a waiting one.   Some echoes of the strikes at the beginning of the month disclose more  of their inner history.  An article by Fritz Ebert, the  president of the old Social  Democrat  party,  published  in &quot; Die  Neue Zeit &quot; for the 15th February, gives an authoritative explanation of the action of the party leaders.     Ebert  lays a  great deal of the blame upon  the Government for tolerating the pan-German  agitation  and the obstruction of electoral  reform  in Prussia, and for failing to realise the feeling of the masses, who suffered under the food shortage and saw others provide for themselves by illicit traffic.   The people  were in a state of extreme irritation :           &quot; The movement in Berlin affected  in the first  instance  only a number  of     munition factories.  Then the deputation of members of our party from the most     various industries  presented  themselves at  the party headquarters.  About     mid-day  we  had  to meet  a  larger  assembly [of worker-delegates.   Everyone     declared  that the  embitterment  of   the  working-class  was  so strong that the     workers must give vent to their feelings by laying down tools.          &quot; The  leaders  could  not leave  such a  movement  to  be directed by the     Independents and the &apos; Spartacus&apos; section.  The entrance  of the party leaders into     the movement was necessary to secure that it should take an orderly course and     have a reasonable issue.&quot;     Ebert goes on to charge the  Government with great want of discretion in  theirhandling  of the situation, by which,  he says,  the strike  in Berlin was unnecessarilyprolonged.  Some further light on these events may be gathered from a Trade Unionorgan, &quot; Die Topfer &quot; (&quot; The Potters &quot;) :-          &quot; The strike came at a most unfortunate moment, just when coal and material     were scarce.   The time was ill-chosen for  the proletariat to display its power; the     strike itself was far from  being  general; the tactics adopted  during  the  strike-     showed no  unity of will directed to a definite - goal.   Under such  conditions any     strike, any movement, must collapse.&quot;     According to  the  &quot; Weser Zeitung&quot;  (22nd  February), &quot;A very extensive andsystematic agitation is now proceeding with the object of fomenting a fresh strike.&quot;     A light was thrown upon the  struggle between the old Social Democrat  party andthe Independents by the Niederbarnim by-election to fill the seat in the Reichstag leftvacant by the death of the  Independent leader, Stadthagen.   In Niederbarnim, one ofthe districts of Berlin, the Independents were believed to be strong.  The candidate putup  by the old (Government) Social  Democrat party was Rudolph  Wissel, one of theleaders of the metal-workers; the Independent candidate was Rudolph  Breitscheid.The election took place on the 14th March, and the result was the loss of the seat to theIndependents.  One of  the  causes of this  surprising event may have  been  that  verylarge numbers of the vor-ers were  away on active service.   Another reason  may havebeen that the choice of Breitscheid as candidate was not a happy one.  His  past wassomewhat compromising, since he had at  one time belonged to the Extreme RightNationalist  wing of the  party.  In fact, Franz Mehring, the  leader of a section stillmore extreme than the  Independents, had before the election  called upon the party tosubstitute another candidate.   Breitscheid had  appealed to him, for  the sake of  then-common cause, to bury the  hatchet.   &quot; If  we  lose Stadtha^ens seat,&quot; he wrote, &quot; thatwill be a  serious  blow for the Independent party and check the propagation of  theirideas.&quot;  They have lost  the seat.   Stadthairen&apos;s seat in the  Municipal  Council, on theother  hand, the Independents  succeeded in retaining,  though they  did so by only  anarrow majority, 1,362 votes to  1,018.   Since the district in question had been a hotbedof Independent  ferment, and the  voters on both  sides belonged to the working-class,the &quot; Internationale Korrespondenz &quot; claims that this result too shows  that the influenceof the Independents upon the mass of  the  people is declining. y We may perhaps see inwhat has happened an indication that the peace in the East has really enfeebled theIndependent propaganda.   It was the  general  distress and  despair which swelled the       * See, however, with regard to David and the Majority Socialists, appendix to this report.
 Independents&apos; ranks.   The peace  in  the  East has  no doubt brought  great moral alleviation  and new hope  to  the  German  people.   They will ba the less disposed to quarrel with the Government and cry out for an immediate termination of the war.     It is. well known that the organised  German &quot; Free &quot; Trade Unions (&quot; Gewerk- schaften&quot;) have  lent great strength to the Government  Social Democrats against the Independents.  Great efforts have  been made by the Independents to win the Trade Unions for  their ideas efforts which have met with but poor success.  In  the greatest Trade Union  of all, indeed, the  metal-workers, the Independents have succeeded in gaining very nearly half the Union, but  the great  Trade Unions, as a whole, continue to  be one  of the  chief obstacles  in German)&apos;-to the  work of the Independents.  The Union of the Workers in Wood  Industries (&quot; Holzarbeiterverband &quot;) ha^ endorsed the policy of their leaders by  a three-quarters  majority, even the Leipzig members of the Union going by two-thirds against the  Independents (&quot; Internationale Korrespondenz&quot; for the 18th January, 1918).   The  Leipzig  branch of the Tailors&apos; ,Union, which had been won by the Independents, went back   recently to the  Federation.  The  officials of the Dresden  Trade Unions held a  conference on the  18 th  January,  at which  they passed  an almost  unanimous  resolution against the  Independent propaganda.   At Stuttgart, one of the Independent strongholds, the  Independents are  trying to start a rival Trade  Union organisation (&quot; Daily Review &quot; for 28th February).     At the beginning of the  war,  the Trade Unions, like the Social Democrat party, lost  heavily in membership.   It has been  a feature  of  the  last year  or so that, in contrast with the Social Democrat party, the Trade Unions have shown a remarkable recovery.    Recent figures in several Unions illustrate this.   At the end of the third quarter of 1917 the Glass-Workers  Union  numbered 6,878  members;  by  the time of their conference on  the 13th and 14th January, 1918, their membership had risen  over 7,000.  The Union of Factorv-Workers f&quot; Fabrikarbeiter &quot;), numbering about  210,000 members,  lost 20,225 members in 1917, but  gained  some  55,000 a net  gain  of more than 30,000.   The workers in  Wood  Industries (&quot; Holzarbeiter&quot;) increased during 1917 from 68,240 to 90,118 gaining nearly as many members during the first three quarters  as in the  three preceding years put together.  The Metal-Workers&apos;  Union made during  1917  the greatest increase it had ever made in its history,  from  248,000 to 388,000.     A publication of importance,  issued since the beginning of this year,  is  the official programme of the Federation of German Trade Unions.*   An article by Emil Kloth in the &apos;; Sozialistische  Monatshefte &quot; for the  19th February gives an account  of it, from which what follows is taken :                   ,                         fc         &quot; With regard to social policy,  the manifesto culminates in the  demand for a     Ministry of Labour for  the Empire, presiding over an Imperial Labour  Office, with     subordinate offices in the several Federated States, provinces, and municipalities.     Chambers of Labour (&quot; Arbeitskammer &quot;) are to  be instituted  in the  several States     and municipalities, in which employers and workers are to sit  in equal numbers.     Everything which concerns the common  interests of employers and employed shall     fall within the  competence of  these  Chambers.  All  existing restrictions of the     right of coalition must  be done  away with.  Boards  of Arbitration, consisting in     equal numbers  of emploj^ers and employed, must be established for  the  settlement     of industrial disputes, with an Imperial  Conciliation Office at the top.   Legislation     affecting  labour must be made uniform  all over  the  Empire.  The  manifesto goes     on to deal with workers&apos; insurance, the State regulation  of demand and supply in     labour,  assessory councils, in which workers are represented, for safeguarding their     interests,  in view of the probable formation of great Trusts after  the  war.   The     manifesto asks  for &apos; the  progressive lowering of customs  duties on manufactured     articles and agricultural produce ; the abolition  of indirect taxes;  the abolition of     all  customs barriers between Germany   and neighbouring friendly States;  the     conclusion of commercial treaties for as long a period as possible  with  foreign     countries; the securing of raw materials in sufficient quantity; the  settlement of     international economic disputes by negotiation and arbitration ; the extension  and     uniform administration of ways of communication, posts, and telegraphs;  institution     of technical schools, laboratories, and exhibitions ; State control of all associations     which aim at regulating production, trade, and transport;  participation  of workers,     side by  side with employers, in economic  policy, through elected representatives of     the independent industrial  organisations.&apos; &quot;   * &quot; Social-Political Demands of the Workers of the German Trade Unions.  A Social-Political WorkingMan&apos;s Programme, presented as a Memorandum by the General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germanyto the Legislative Bodies of the Empire and of the Federated Siates &quot; : Berlin, 1918.      [367]                                                            B 2
     Both points out that the &quot; abolition of all customs barriers between Germany andneighbouring friendly States &quot; seems to point  to the  &quot; Mittel-Europa&quot;  idea, and that&quot; the securing  of  raw materials in sufficient  quantities &quot;  seems to imply a Germancolonial Empire.     While the Trade Unions  seem to  give little  encouragement to the Independents&apos;anti-war propaganda, there is evidence of discontent amongst the rank  and  file  atindustrial conditions.   The  directorates of the four Miners&apos; Unions  have recommendedthe  workers&apos; committees  to ask for a considerable  increase of wages.   These fourorganisations have also addressed a complaint to the  Imperial Clothing Office  at thewholly inadequate provision of clothes and footgear to the miners.  &quot; The miners cannotpossibly work in wooden  shoes.&quot;  A letter  to the  &quot;Internationale Korrespondenz&quot;(19th  February)  complains  of the under-feeding  of the workers  in the Rhenish-Westphalian country.  Illicit traffic in  food  goes on, and the Government measurecomes perhaps too  late.  &quot; It is unquestionable that the workers in the &apos; heavy industry &apos;(ironworks), especially the foundry-workers and miners, cannot possibly get  along on thegeneral rations.&quot;  The industrial workers were compelled to buy, at a  high price, foodprocured  by illicit means,  &quot; since otherwise they could  not possibly keep up theirstrength.&quot;  The glass-workers, at their  conference in January, passed a resolution thatthe General Commission of the Trade Uuions of Germany  had failed to show  properenergy in championing the interests of the workers with the Government.     The  Government on its  side has  shown its readiness to go  some way to meet thedemands of Labour.   In outlining the legislative programme in the Reichstag, the Vice-Chancellor, Von Payer, stated  that it included a Bill establishing  a Chamber of Labour,and  an abolition of the obnoxious paragraph  153. dealing with the right  of coalition.It is a new feature of the times that working men are now drawn in as representatives inGovernment  offices,  so,  for instance,  two  Trade  Union secretaries,  Schippel andStegerwald, have a place in  the newly constituted Financial  Assessory Council attachedto the Imperial Treasury, and  P. Mtiller, the leader of the  Seamen&apos;s Union and editorof the &quot; Courier,&quot;  the organ of the transport-workers,  sits on the Imperial Committeefor the Restoration of German Shipping.     It may be noted  that the Government is preparing  a  Bill to secure compensationto persons injured by enemy air raids.  Compensation for material damage was alreadysecured by a law  of the  3rd  July, 1916. It  is now a question of compensation forpersonal injuries.  (&quot;Internationale Korrespondenz&quot; for the 18th January,  1918.)                                   APPENDIX.    The balance of evidence tends to show what the great majority  ot the Germanmasses ardently desire is the earliest possible end of the war.  But there  is naturallygreat divergence of opinion as to the best method  of securing it.   As is only natural,the words of the Emperor and the Generals about  the Eastern peace having beensecured by the &quot; German sword &quot; find a wide echo ;  and it may be safely asserted that,even among the masses, there are many who are willing to give  &quot;the German sword&apos;&apos;-another trial on the Western front,   if only an early peace can be secured, it will notbe rejected by German  public  opinion because it was  obtained  by fighting.  Whatpopular opinion protests  against  is  the screwing  up  oi&apos; peace  terms by the Pan-Germans and the great industrialists,  since  it is  now  quite  clear that the  WesternPowers will fight to the last gasp against such terms.  It is also argued  that the natureof the Eastern peace and the methods by which it has been secured are  bound to act asan incitement to the Western Powers to redouble their efforts in order  to escape, a fatelike that of Russia.     It is mainly in the light of these considerations that the movement of impatienceand dissatisfaction among the Majority (&quot; tame&quot;) Socialists in the Reichstag ought to beregarded.   David is one of the  ablest intellects among the followers of Scheidemann,and  if&apos;  parliamentary criticism  counted for much at the  moment  his  speech  m  theReichstag  last Monday would  be  very significant.    Herding had just been boastingthat  the treaty with Russia contained &quot;no conditions whatever that were dishonouringto Russia,  no mention of oppressive  war  indemnities and no forcible appropriation ofRussian territory.&quot;     David replied that the Brest-Livotsk peace was not  a  peace by understanding  but&quot; an  unvarnished  peace by  force.&quot;    Germany&apos;s diplomatists had  capitulated tv  the
representatives of the purely militarist idea of might.  This peace had evoked dissatis-faction among the widest circles of the German nation and had shaken  confidence in thehonesty of Germany&apos;s policy.  It could not be reconciled with the repeated declarationsof the Chancellor on the right of peoples to self-determination.   The  German demandwas that &quot; the right of the frontier peoples to self-determination should be regarded inthe sense of severance from  Russia.&quot;  The militarist  party  wanted  to  bottle up thePoles in the East and to carry out big annexations and  dismemberment in the  Westunder the watchword of militar)7 security.  Poland justly  desired &quot; a window towardsRussia.&quot;   What  the Chancellor had said about the desires  of Lithuania did  notcorrespond with the facts, since mistrust of Germany  had recently manifested itself inLithuania.   The military party, which wanted to make Lithuania not independent buta  Junker military  colony,  lording  it over  a  submissive population !of Lithuanianpeasants, would not permit the Lithuanian delegation to come to Berlin.  The  NationalCouncil of Courland had no right to speak on behalf of the  Lettish population, and thewhole &quot; new orientation &quot; in Courland  was  the result of an arrangement between thePrussian Junkers and the  Baltic Barons.   In Finland the mass of the population wouldbe  enraged  at  German interference.  In  a  word, they were  risking  the  sharpestantagonism to public feeling all along the line, and &quot; the whole  Eastern  region will beconverted into a smouldering furnace.&quot;    David&apos;s  is  not the  only  &quot;tame&quot;  Socialist  protest.   In  the  &quot;FrankfurterVolkstimme&quot; Hermann Wendel, also a prominent  Majority Socialist deputy, regardsthe situation as so grave that he thinks the Socialists ought to refuse to vote any morewar credits.   Nothing could  conceal the fact  that the Socialist peace policy  had metwith complete disaster.  They had desired  a lasting peace by   understanding.  Whatthey had got in the East was a peace based on force, which only  meant a truce usheringin a period of renewed armaments.   The Reichstag Peace Resolution of the 19th Julyhad become a mere &quot;scrap of paper.&quot;  German  troops were  being used  in Finland tobeat down the revolution &quot; a glorious task ! &quot;    If Majority  Socialist protests  of this kind  had been uttered last summer  theGovernment  would have  trembled at them.  But the whole situation has undergonea  fundamental change.  There  has been first  of all the  exhibition  of  Bolshevistincapacity and anarchy and  its terrible results  for  Russia.   The  backbone of  theGerman Social Democracy, the Trade Unions,  is composed of fairly sensible working-men,  in: this  respect  not unlike the elite  of the  English working-classes.  TheirSocialist theories  do not blind them to the  claims  of their  own  material  interests, andthey do not desire to transplant Bolshevism to Germany or to  bolster it up in Russia.Peace may have been won in the East by the sword, but  it has  not recently cost manyGerman lives there.  The advance  into Esthonia, the  Ukraine,  even to Odessa  hasbeen a kind  of military  promenade,  and  at the end of it there is some  prospect ofobtaining foodstuffs and other supplies.  Any peace is better than no peace.  It remainsto be  seen whether the Western Powers will  stand  against the German offensive.   Ifthe event shows that the Eastern peace has really  stiffened their  resistance and madeit invincible, it will then be time enough to protest against the policy  of Hertling andthe field-marshals.o
