&quot;F&quot;------- 1________April 3, 1918CTbte Document \i the PropertyoiHis SHTHE CRISIS IN SPAIN.Political Intelligence Department,           FOREIGN OFFICE.                            OOjl5(5       It  is long  since  any  political events in Spain caused somuch rejoicing as  the solution  of  the Ministerial crisis whichwas still acute when the lest Report was written a fortnightago.    Senor Maura had  then just undertaken to form a Ministryhut his first effort failed.    It  is said to have taken the formof an  attempt to f orm.a. Conservative Cabinet with the assistanceof Senor  Besada and rwith the ultimate object of ousting SenorDate and  recovering the Conservative leadership for Senor Maurahimself,  who has never  acquiesced  in his more or less compulsoryretirement after  the lerrer affair in 1907.   But riesada wouldnot desert Dato and so  the  scheme broke down.   The crisis ap-peared insoluble and the King was left to face the most diffi-cult situation which has ever confronted him.   It was necessaryto make his choice between the Army on the one hand,  whose of-ficers had in the previous crisis a month ago sent him a notedemanding that Senor la Cierva would remain at the uar Office,and on the other hand the statesmen who were practically unani-mcus in desiring that the &quot;dictator under dictation&quot;  (as SenorUnamuno called Cierva)  should disappear and the  civil Governmentof Spain  reassert its authority over the Army.    It is  believedthat he hesitated and was half inclined to  try the  dangerousexperiment of Cierva with a dissolution and practically a breakwith Constitutional regime.    Happily wiser oounsels,  said tohave been those of the  Queen Mother,  prevailed:   and  he  recoiledbefore a  decision which would almost  certainly have been thebeginning of the end of the  Monarchy,    But the unconstitutionalsolution being put aside,  there remained the very difficult task                                                         /of
 of providing a constitutional solution.    Mo party has a majority in the Cortes and the  attempts at  coalitions made  during the  last few weeks had been unsuccessful.    The fact that a solution has been found,  at any rate for  the present,  is a great proof of  the value of  the Monarchy  as an  institution.    One does not see how it oould  have been found without the  intervention  of someone  out- side and  above parties.    And it is a credit to the judgment, courage and  persuasive power of the King.    So at  least the Span- ish people think,  and  Spaniards say that  the King  has  not  for many years enjoyed such popularity as he  possesses at  the moment. Uo  doubt  his  task required all  the iforees he could bring to it. Rumour even  says  thst  the  desired  coalition was not  brought about till he had  plainly told the  rival statesmen thpt  the  alternative was  his abdication.    But  this  is  a mere report.    En  any case the  decision  was  reached very rapidlyrand both the rapidity of the  solution  and  its nature may fairly be held  to  show not  only the  extreme gravity of the danger  but  the patriotism of the poli- tical  leaders.       The  result  is a Cabinet containing 4  former  &apos;brime Ministers,Maura himself, Dato, Alhucemas  and Romanones, besides two otherleaders of parties, Alba and Oembo.   lora Rosebery has said thatan ex-Prime Minister in  a  Cabinet  is usually a  cootly and em-barrassing luxury&quot;*   Yihat will four be, especially when combinedwith a man like Oaiabo,  thought by  some to be the strongest man inSpain, who was less than a year ago at the head of the uncon-stitutional &quot;Parliament&quot; of Barcelona and in olose  alliance withthe rebellious &quot;Juntas&quot;  of the officers?   One Can  only hope thatthe very gravity of the situation whioh alone brought sush men toact  together, supported by the authority of the,Kin? and Maura&apos;sundoubted strength of will and character,  may keep  them togethertill they have steered  Spain through the troubled waters.                                                        /Special
                         - 3 - Special credit  is  due  to Dato and  Mhucemas.  each  of whom  is at the head of a  large party  whose homogeneity may  easily he  endangered by a coalition.    The  others like  Romanones,  Alba  and  Cambo, who have few followers, have little  to  lose and  may  even stand to gain. The General Election in Which the  RegiOnalists did much  less well than they  had hoped probably taught Cambo  the lesson that  he could not stand  alone.   The most obvious differences  between the  present Cabinet and the last are that it represents all  instead of some  oi the Monarchical parties and groups, that they are all represented  not by subordinates but by their 1eaters,  and that the  Prime Minister  who has  to hold it together is a much stronger man  than the Marquis of alhucemas.   But what is much more  important is the  disappearance of La Cierva and the policy he  represented,   &quot;The true  name of the new Cabinet&quot;, says a French paper very  justly, &quot;is supremacy of the civil power&quot;.   When the last crisis was solved by the victory  of La  Cierva over the affair of  the Army decrees, the  newspaper  which  is the organ of theofficers exultantly declared that his triumph marked the end of the parliamentary system in Spain.   For the moment  the pendulum of power has  swung the other way.   Ciervr* has gone,  significantly escorted to the Railway Statinn  by  a concourse of  officers, and a Prime Minister  is  in office who  has  again and again publicly declared that the &amp;rmy must submit to the Civil Government.   The Postal Servants,  whose passive strike and  Cierva&apos;s  drastic treatment of it seems to have been the immediate cause of  the crisis,  have yielded in the confidence  that Parliament will redress their grievances,  and have been  allowed  to return to their places.    There is no serious doubt of the justice of their claims:  for while their work has in- creased five-fold  they have never been able to obtain an increase in their numbers or an improvement  in their instruments.    They did not ask for an  increase of oay,   it  is said, in marked contrast to the                                                         officers/
                           - 4 -officers who were to obtain considerable rises in pay by the decreesissued by. La Cierva, while promotion was to be solely by seniority.These decrees have not been repealed nor have the officers  Juntasbeen dissolved though the new Minister of War, General Marina, isbelieved to desire to dissolve them.   The Army problem thereforeremains outstanding and its gravity is only too obvious.   Uo doubtthe Spanish Army needs many things to make it an effective force.But it ought not to need money.   For it already obtains 42;? of thetotal Budget of Spain whereas the French Army which comes next inproportion of the national expenditure only obtains 20J&amp;.   And thiswas before the proposed increases of Ciervars reforms which follow ongreat inorease in the last few yearSc   The truth is that there isplenty of room for economy in an Army which in 1914 had mere Colonelsthan the German Army and is to-day said to have more Field-officersthan Subalterns, and over EO0 Generals on full pay commanding the67,000 soldiers quartered in Spain itesfefef as distinct from Morocco.   This problem of the Army,  its reform and discipline,  is thebiggest domestic problem before the Ministry and will obviouslytax all its powers.   By his handling of it Maura!s statesmanshipwill be mainly judged as far as home affairs go.&quot;   As to Foreign Affairs it is too early as yet to form an ooinionof the attitude of the new Government.   But there are reasons forthinking it may be more friendly to us than the last,    While thegreat battle in France continues it will probably not do much morethan hold its breath and watch.  But-should the German effort bedefeated or die away in comparative failure the presence of Dato atthe Foreign Office and the Prime Ministerfs pride and sense cfpersonal and national dignity may easily lead to a much  more decidedaction being taken against the aggression of German submarines cn in esea and the intrigues of German agents through-out Spain than thelast Government ever thought of taking-    It is a great  gain that the
recent-revelations as to the German Embassy&apos;s dealings with anar-ehists have proved to all Spaniards onen to argument or evidence thetruth of what we have always asserted ,  that it is the Germans notv/e who organise strikes and revolutionary disturbances.   And thereason v/e gave is the reason avowed in the conversations with theanarchist Pascual: bis. that it is to the interest of Germany todisturb the industrial life of Spain which only benefits the Allies.It seems certain that German Influence and Spanish pro-Germanismmust be diminished by the clear demonstration  of these facts .There is also a growing impatience with the sinking of Spanish shipswhich^oes not prevent German submarines taking refuge in Spanishports when injured.   As these words are written news arrives thatthe new Government has issued an official statement as to the pro-tests it has received from important bodies all round the coast asto Spanish losses and assured the country of its sympathy with theseprotests and of the earnest attention it is giving to the question.It is even reported that it is taking a firm stand on the subjectwith Germany.
