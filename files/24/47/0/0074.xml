8th April,18.//PUBLICATION  OF  SHIPPING  LOSSESAMD  NEW  MERCHANT  TONNAGE  OUTPUT .Admiralty Memorandum for the V/ar Cabinet.     The Board of Admiralty have had under consideration theform in which the losses and output of merchant tonnage should,in future, be published and the times at which such publicationshould be made in order to scarry out the promise recently givenin the House of Commons.     As the tonnage figures are now to be given, it is thoughtthat the numbers of vessels involved should no longer be madepublic.     If the enemy has only the total tonnage figures forthe previous month before him he will probably find it moredifficult to check the reports of his Submarine Commanders thanhitherto, as. before doing so it will be necessary for him, bysome calculation, to translate the tonnage lost into numbers ofvessels sunk.     It is, therefore, proposed to discontinue thepresent form of publication entirely, as soon as the new systemof publication operates.     It is suggested that the following Returns should bepublished monthly :-    I.   Losses of Merchant Tonnage,             This Return to be published three weeks after the end of each month and to show separately for the preceding month the total of British tonnage lost  and of Allied and Neutral tonnage lost  owing, to  enemy action and marine risk.    v This  Return was  promised so far as regards British losses and would be misleading^unless Allied and Neutral losses  are also given.
    II   Sailings to and, from United Kingdom,,             This Return to be published on the same date as (I)         and to show the total tonnage of all vessels of 500         gross tons and over which during the preceding month         entered and cleared United Kingdom Ports from and to         ports overseas but excluding coastwise and cross-channel         traffic.   The form of this Return has been agreed with         the Minister of Shipping.   III.  New Merchant Ship Construction.             This Return to be published on the f^vst Thursday in         each month (on-the second Thursday when the first falls         earlier than the 3rd of the month) and to show the total         tonnage of merchant vessels completed in  United Kingdom         Yards and entered for service during the preceding         month and the Quarterly output of Merchant Tonnage in         the United Kingdom and Allied and Neutral Countries.     It is also proposed to include in each Return,  forcomparison, corresponding figures for preceding periods.     A copy of each of the proposed forms of Return is attachedfor the approval of the War Cabinet.     Possibly it may  bethought desirable to inform the principal Allies of ourintentions as to the publication, in the form proposed, oftheir Losses and Output of Merchant Tonnage.      If the Cabinetapproves, I will arrange this with the Foreign Office.                      (Signed)   ERIC GEDDES.April,  1918.
