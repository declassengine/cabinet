                                                   ISMEMORANDUM BY THS PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRiO)E.   (1)   In the minute3 of the meeting of the 7/ar CaMnetheld on tho 25th March 1918 it is reported that the  &quot;Minis-try of National Service stated that the release of PortLabour is &quot;being soriously delayed.&quot;   (2)   The Board of Trade first heard that Dock Trans-port .7orkerc might bo expected to provide 6,000 &quot;A&quot; menon tho 2nd January 1918, when tho Director General ofRecruiting stated that the War Cabinot had &quot;provisionallydecided&quot; that 6,000 &quot;A&quot; men must be supplied before 30thJune 1918*   The Board immediately questioned the accur-acy of the figures.   (o)   Tho report of the 7*ar Cabinet Committee on ManPo-er recolanenfls the release, under the heading of &quot;Sail-way &amp; Transport&quot;, of 12,000 men.   The Ilsi lways agreedto release 6,000 men and the Ministry of National Servicoallocated tho remaining 6,000 to Docks, although othor non-railway transport labour e.g. carters should have borno alarge  share.  The Board stated they would do all in theirpower to meet these needs but that thoy regarded 3,000 menas an outside estimate of the number of dock transportworkers that could safely be released from the ports.  ThoCommittee^ recommendation apparently novor received thoapproval of the 7?ar Cabinet.   (4)   On the 5th January 1918 a Conference was held atthe Ministry to consider the proposed withdrawal of 6,000nA&quot; men from the ports, and on the 19th January the Boardsent a letter to the Director General of Recruiting re-minding him that the Minister had agreed to meet rcpresonia-tives of the Dock Transport Workersx  Organisations to getthem to a r.ec to;-                                                  fover)SECRET.                    DOCX TRANSPORT tfORXERS.                 RELEASE OF&apos; LOT ?OR THE ARMY.
      fa)  A Dock Labour Transfer Schema,      (b)  A freer use of the Transport Workers1 Battalion,      It ms on tho express understanding that these twoprinoiples were aoceptod that the Board were prepared totry and meet the wishes of the Ministry.   (5)   The Director General of Recruiting said that hereoognised that the question of release was &quot;closely in-volved with that ofAincreasing the mobility of port labour&quot;and that a Conference had been called for the  9th Januaryto discuss a scheme prepared by the Ministry on the abovelines.   At this Conforenoc the Transport Workers1 Federa-tion  stated that they were not prepared to acoopt thoMinistry^ Sohome and offered to put forward an alterna-tive  one.   (6)   On the 11th February 1916 the Board of Srado in aletter to the Ministry stated that the East Coast Portlabour Ccmmittoes after holding special meetings to considerthe matter had reportod, generally, that further releases ofmen would jeopardiso the working of tho ports and, in prossingfor the provision of efficient substitutes, pointed out thatthis  objection would apply with even greater strength to theWest  and South Coast ports.   (7)   Meanwhile the release of men has been going on.This  year&apos;o returns shew a total of over 1,400 men releasodof whom 750 are presumed to have hcen in Class ,fAw.  The totalnumber of Exemption Certificates withdrawn since the beginningof 1917 is G580 of which it is presumed 4,367 wcro &quot;A&quot; men.If some of the3e men have not roachod the Army tho fault docsnot lie with tho Committees or with the Board.   (8)   Moreover seeing that neither a Dock LabourTransfer Scheme nor a scheme of substitution for DockTransport Workers has boon settled by the Ministry andlooking to (a) the fluctuating dejoands for dock labour,induced especially by the convoy system (b)  the low                                                  kevW)-
physical capacity of many dock workers, and (c) the com-paratively small residue of exempted men (43,000 inFebruary 1913;  net 47,000 as we had supposed in January1918), the above facts, in my view, show clearly that ifthere has been any avoidable delay in providing men it hasnot been on the port of the Board of Trade, and that anysuggestion that they have been unwilling to help the Minis-try of National Service is without foundation.   (9)   The taking away of &quot;A&quot; men from already depletedports weakens the man power of port labour by considerablymore than the number of men who go, for the &quot;A&quot; men aro theStrongest aijfi the &quot;gangs&quot; in which the men work are thrownout of gear.   Further^ much of the work is so arduousand the weights handled so heavy that only roung, strongmen can perform it, and female labour is, I think, outof the question.  (10)   The demand for 5,000 more Grade I men (apartfrom the possibility of industrial troubles) will imposegrave and, I am afraid, disastrous disabilities in the matterof turning ships round quickly, handling war stores, foodetc. at the Forts unless, in addition to some system ofmaking Dock Labour mobile, the doploted Ports have (a)the assistance of a sufficient number of suitable substitutes,preferably ex-dock transport workers who may now be servingin the Homo Forces and (b) the first call on the 5,000 menproposod to be added to the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion.  (11)   There are difficulties in the way of the employ-ment of the Transport 7/orkers1 Battalions except in the caseof emergency.  These difficulties are referred to in Mem-oranda by the Minister of Uational Service (G.T.2236,  307,and 2444).                      (Signed).  A.H. STANLEY.     3rd April, 1918.
