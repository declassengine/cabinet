France. Italy and the     Unites States is  to meet regularly at the Foreign Office in London     and to consider all Blockade questions which affect the Northern     Heutrale.   Joint Allied Trade Committees, at Stockholm, Ghris-     tianis, Copenhagen and  the Hague, will take over many of the fune-     tions hitherto performed by  the British Legations.  These local     Committees will  report direct to the Allied Bloc leads Committee in     London and concurrently tothe several Allied Governments in London,     Paris, Rome and Washington.  They will study trade conditions in     tbeir respective neutral countries and will raske recommendations     for strengthening the blockade.   They will ascertain how far our     various agreements with the  Central Importing Associations are     carried out and  the usual guarantees observed.   They will super -     vies the edrtini strati on of the various r&amp;tisma and embargoes and     Will confer with  the various Associations of Sentrals on all $neat     tiona arising out of applications for imports.  They will receive     the guarantees  of these Associations and transmit them to the     Contraband Committee in London.        Closer cooperation between the Allies in  the allocation and     employment of tonnage will bs sectored by the Allied Maritime     Council, which  will meet In  London about once a month.    rest     Britain,  Italy,  France and  the United States will each be rep re-     sen ted  by  two Delegates,   The current work of the Council will     be carried on by four national divisions, one for  each of the     Allies.    The work of these  four divisions will be coordinated     by regular meetings  of  the heads of  the divisions.   The divisions     will  prepare estimates  of the imports required by the  several

Inter-Allied   Executive  dosis&amp;tteee  will be set  up, one for each of  the main olsss-   es of imports essential  to the Allies  in carrying on  the war. These   Committees will  draw  up  progrtiwm&amp; of  import requirements fer the   guidance of the  Allied Maritime Council.         The  coordination of the Allied Statutory Lists  for Latin   America will henceforth  be  effected at Washington, where weekly   meetings are now  held between  the War   rade Board and the Allied   representatives.  E.K, Ministers  in South Amsrlea will henceforth   address to Washington their communications and reeanHuendat ions  in   regard  to  the statutory List, HOBWAY.   It was anticipated that the Norwegian Government would sif^n   the Agreement with the United States as soon as  it tsas satisfactorily   drafted.  Dr. Nansen,  however, has no??  raised  farther  points  for   d i souse ion.  lone of  these points are of the first Importance; and   his object in raising  them Is apparently to prolong -these negotiations   until  the  result  ia known of the terrasn offensive in the West, gggyjg.   The Banes have  concluded a new Commercial Agreement with   Germany and Austria for a period of four months from April 1st.  The   Germans will continue  to  famish  fuel to Denmark,  as under the  pre-   vious  Agreement,  and  they will  send further supplies of potash and   salt,  and  increased Quantities of iron and eteol,  including mater-   ials  for sfeipfcailding.    The Auatrians will deliver benzine and   other  Tm  materials required by the Danish Industries,   The  Danes   will maintain their exports of Danish agricultural produce to 3er-   raany,  for  the most part  at  the old prices.       The United  States Govern men % despair of reaching an Agreement   with Denmark either  for  limiting  Danish exports of agricultural pro-   duce to Sermany or  securing further Quantities of Danish tonnage.
                                                               129                                                               3. ffhey suggest that  we  should  adopt  the policy of allowing Denmark particular cargoes in return for  suitable concessions.   We should like the United  States to wait until the military position Is clear- er, but we shall not  object  to any action which they may decide to tske.   We agree with the United  States  that&quot;it would be inadvisable to press Benmark too  severely.  More particularly we are opposed to any requisitioning of Danish ships,  fhe Germans might retaliate by mskini use of Danish  territory or Danish territorial ssaters.IIP11 *   ^ Swedish Government  are not likely  to accept  the draft Allied Swedish Agreement as it  stands.   The Germans have refused to sanction the proposed restriction of their supplies of Swedish iron ore. and will not  permit the Swedes to accept  our terms unless their consent has  previously been obtained,  fhe Swedish mission, whioh recently visited Berlin, haa apparently  secured no real con- cessions,  Meanwhile  the Sermsns  insist  that Swedish vessels shell carry German safe-conducts  against the submarines on peril of being sunk if they neglect  this precaution.  During  the Isst fer weeks Swedish opinion has stiffened against  coming to terms with the  -Li- I.&apos;&quot; *3 o     Sir IS. Howard  thinka thai. ,  if the  Swedes do not shortly make definite oeunter-proposaIs  for an Agreement, we should require the? to accept or reject the present  draft within a wee:-:, and that, fill ing a satisfactory answer,  we should requisition the Swedish shipn ing in Allied ports,   $he FBsnch end Italian Ministers at Stocfchol support this recommend at ion.    hare are at present only 470,000 tons deadweight of Swedish  shipping trading in Allied interests as compared with 615,000 tons  deadweir-ht  available for requisition in Allied waters.THKRLAHSS.   Mr. London, in  a ilote of March 30th, protests thatour action in requisitioninp the Dutch ships is a  breach of right end of the respect due to Sovereign States.    In  the view of the Dutcj
                                                                130 j    Government our  under taking to  replace  the ships destroyed and    oar various proposals for minimising the  inconvenience  and  loss    to the Putch shipowners do not repair  the injury inflicted.  The    Dutch Government  consider that their economic  negotiations  with    the Allies are  broken off by our  action,  and  will no?; ^ait  for the    Allied aovcrnments to declare  their intentions.        for the present no ships are  to be despatched from  Holland to    overseas ports  to fetch the supplies which we  have rut  at the dis-    posal of the Dutch,  The Dutch Government profess to  be afraid thsf    such ships may  be indefinitely detained on their arrival  in Allied    waters.  There  is no ground for this apprehension, os we  have oro-    mised in the most definite terms  to accord every facility for tfcoij    voyages outward and invard.   The Dutch Government are  probably    waiting to learh Qermny1s intentions  in regard to these  vessels.    Sir f, Jownley  understands that the German and Dutch  Governments    have provisionally agreed to negotiate e  new Agreement  during April    and that the Germans w ill orohsbly undertake not to interfere with j    Dutch shipping:  provided they are  allowed  to exercise  some Ibrra of    supervision over passengers and csr^o  leaving  Holland.SWIjPZgRSAiil).    fhe federal (Government have agreed to arrange credits                                                                      I    for account of  H,H, Government up to fr, 10,000,000 monthly,  and    to leave for future settlement the general economic questions    hitherto discussed in connection  with  this matter, The sums put a1j    our disposal will be  proportionate to  the amount of goods delivered    for Swiss account in European  ports,    he Swiss will  require 20,001    tons of goods per month to be  delivered before they make  any advanl    098*   Thereafter they will make  advances on a sliding  scsle.  We    have promised to  grant chartering licences for tonn ge  sufficient    to carry 50,000 tons of goods  monthly  (i,e, 76,000 tone deadweight (    of shipping);   but vs do not  guarantee that this  tonnege will    actually be forthcoming.

They have/pro-Tisionolly agreed with the S^iss that these exports Should oelilted to (a) 1,000 tons per annum o f embroideries,  (b) 500 tonsper annum of cotton tissues and  (c) 200 tons per annum of knitted I                  -                          ,                       1goods,   The exports of Swiss elastic tissues would be suppressesaltogether,   - he allied delegates do not think It possible toobtain better terms without seriously estranging Swiss opinion,and they re contend H,M, Crovernaient to ratify these proposals,     The Sermons are negotiating for a renewal of the German-SwissEconomic Agreement which expires on April 30th.   5?hey are appar-ently asking for a stricter control over the use of Sermon rev-material in Swiss facto ri os*  They specifically demand that nogoods manufactured with the aid of German coal shall be exportedto Allied countries.   We discussed  this question exhaustively  withthe 3vd ss during 1917 and came to the conclusion that, owing to  the jextreme complication of the cases arising in industries which  usematerials obtained both from Allied and enemy sources, It would  beinadvisable to insist that ras tor ials imported from Allied sourcesshould in no case  be  used to manufacture goods for Germany,  Wereserved the right, however, to stiffen our control ever Alliedraw materials if the  Germans should insist upon  a  stricter applies-tion of their own Agreement.  If the Germans persist in their  pro-sent demands we shall claim a stricter control over the Swist                                                                   ifactories which require copper, lubricating oil  and other materialsfrom Allied sources for their Installations.  We should also in-sist upon a total  cessation of the exports to Germany st present                                                                   Iallowed under the S.S.S igre ement*     the Allied 3wias Cattle Agreemert  expired on March 15th,  a adis not likely to be renewed,  fi&apos;he object of the  Agreement was  tolimit the -$ port of Swiss agricultural produce to $ermany.  TheSwiss will have very little surplus produce to export during 1918
      and we shall have difficulty ia persuading them to maintain      their exports  to the  Allies  of condensed milk  and other essential I      commodities,                                                                       B7/          She  French Government  have arranged to send 350,000 tons      of coal to Italy by April  loth on  the under stand ing  that France      receives an equal quantity of British coal by  April  30th. In ordesi      to meet Italy&apos;s  pressing needs it  has been necessary to divert to      the coal trade tonnage  representing a loss of  70.000 tons in the  I      shipping allotted for the  carriage of imports  required by the      Allies. We have asfccd  the United  States to make good this defi-      ciency from the  Dutch shins  which  they have requiSfijtoned; but in      view  of the urgency of  their military programme it is doubtful      whether they  can spare  so  large a  quantity.           The disclosures  of Signor Pirolini in the Italian Chamber re-      gerding the illicit traffic  in cotton and silk between Italy and      the Central Empires through  Switzerland have led to  vigorous ac-      tion  by the Italian Government,  Many of the persons implicated      have  been  arrested.    Stocks  of cotton ^orth 100,000,000 Lire ham      been  seized at Genoa  and s to efts of silk *orth  2,000,030 Lire at.

They  propose  that the Allies should,     wUhin  the limits of  their available  resources, allo^: Argentina      to  import  commodities indispensable to her  industries and should     help her with shipping and capital  for her  commerce.  The Argen-      tine Government would in return allow  the Allies a  first  call     upon Argentine national  produce and would make  any arrangements     which may be necessary for financing  Allied purchases during  the     war.    1?he Argentine  Government have  already arranged with the     United  States to accept  payment for goods imported from Argentina
