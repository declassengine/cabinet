Political Intelligence Department,                     FOREIGN  OFFICE.                             Russia/002. THE BOLSHEVIKS - (II),March  -  November, 1917,     The Revolution of March 1917 caved Russia at the timefrom a shameful peace, but it removed any hope of victoryover Germany on the old basis.  The  summer and autumn of 1917witnessed a series of attempts by Kerenski and Kornilov toobtain military victory in spite of  the Revolution;  theBolsheviks on the other hand preached victory of a differentkind by means of the Revolution.  It was no longer the victoryof Russia over Germany, but the victory of the revolutionaryproletariat throughout Europe.     When the Revolution broke out in March 1917 the Bolshevikleaders were in exile- either abroad or in Siberia.  Had theybeen on the spot from the beginning, it may he thai eventswould have taken a different course.  But it was not tillApril. 16, just a month after the Revolution, that Lenin,accompanied by Zinoviev and other faithful followers, arrivedin Petrograd, having travelled through Germany by permissionof the German Government.   As a destructive force, which wouldrender the victory of Russia on the  old basis impossible, theywere a welcome Influence to the German Government;  as a con-structive force that would arouse the European proletariat toa new victory they were anathema.    But in those days such avictory was remote, and Germany could afford to dismiss it asunlikely.  If the Bolsheviks could destroy Russia as a greatpower, surely Germany could destroy  the Bolsheviks in her owntime, if ever they dared to lift their heads.  So argued themilitary minds of Germany in 1917, and so they still argue to-
day after the experience of Brest-Litovsk.     No sooner had Lenin set foot on Russian soil than he setforth his programme for the Revolution.  This he did in a seriesof articles in Prayda and in a pamphlet, published at the endof April, under the title: &quot;The Tasks of the Proletariat in ourRevolution&quot;.  On April 20 he stated in Pravda the policy to befollowed by his party.   The wpr as conducted by Prince Lvov:sGovernment, he said, was still an imperialist war, and, as such,no support could be given to it.  A revolutionary war on theother hand was only possible when the proletariat and the&apos;poorer -class of the peasantry had taken po&quot;wer into theirown hands, had renounced all annexations and had brokencompletely with the interests of capital.  Cn the ether handthere were many who, in perfect good faith,  es representativesof the masses, urged the ccontinuation of the war purely as awar of defence.  It was the duty of the party, therefore, saidLenin, &quot;to explain to them patiently their mistake and toexpose to them the connection of capital with an imperialistwar. proving that the only wsy to end the war by a reallydemocratic peace was to overthrow capital&quot;.     This was Lenin&apos;s general thesis about the war.   With regarto tactics he went into fuller details.  The first stage of theRevolution gave the power to the bourgeoisie owing to lack oforganisation on the part of the proletariat, but the secondstage must hand over the whole power to the workmen and peasantsWe must, therefore, give no support, says Lenin, to the Pro-visional Government, but must expose the falseness of theirpromises.  We must also recognise tho fact that in most of theSoviets our party is at present in a minority, and that so longas we are in a minority we must confine our work to criticisingand denouncing mistakes.
     The new Government that Lenin was v/orking for was not aParliamentary Republic.  To return to Parliamentary Government.after the creation of the Soviets would,  in his opinion, bea step backwards.  What he demanded  - this was as far back asApril - was a Republic of Workmen&apos;s  and Peasants&apos; Soviets.Unlike the moderate Socialists, he was entirely opposed to thedual authority of the Provisional Government and the Soviets.The control of the Soviets over the  Provisional Government would,lie foresaw, become intolerable to the bourgeoisie, and the latterwould make a desperate attempt to get rid of the Sovietsaltogether.  The only alternative was the dictatorship of theSoviets on the model of the Paris Commune,  &quot;The most perfecttype of a bourgeois State is a parliefntmtry &quot;democratic republic,but revolutionary epochs, beginning  from  the end of the I9thcentury; have brought to light the highest type of a democraticState,  The Paris Commune is the type of  this State, whichsubstitutes for an army and police apart  from the people thedirect arming of the whole people.  From  a parliamentarybourgeois republic it is easy to return to a monarchy, as historyhas shown, for the whole machine of  oppression remains untouched,viz. the army, police and bureaucracy-.-.   The Commune and Sovietsbreak up and remove this machine&quot;.     Lenin&apos;s far-sweeping programme  of reform commanded littlesupport in the early months of the Revolution.  The Sovietsmostly composed of Mensheviks and moderate Social Revolutionarieswho favoured Kerenski&apos;s policy of coalition.  Their Lopes werebased on an International Socialist Conference and pressure brcughto bear on the Allies in the direction of peace.  It was onthese points that they differed fundamentally from the Bolsheviks.&quot;It is impossible to finish the war&quot;, wrote Lenin,  &quot;by an agree-ment between the Socialists of different  countries,  by the will
of the peoples.  All  these phrases  are nothing but the empty,innocent wishes of the petite  bourgeoisie.   The war was causedby half a century1s development of  world  capital with itsmillions of ramifications.   It is impossible to pass at onebound from an  imperialist war  and obtain  a  democratic peacewithout overthrowing  the power of capital and transferring thegovernment to  the people&quot;.     It was not until the failure of  the  July offensive that theinfluence of the Bolsheviks  began to  make itself felt.   TheBolsheviks had opposed the offensive  from the beginning and hadremained deaf  to Kerenski&apos;&apos;s  patriotic appeals.  They refused tobelieve that the army could  fight,  exhausted as it was by nearlythree years of war, while on the other hand they argued thateven if Kerenski succeeded he  would simply be playing into thehands of his political opponents on the Plight.     The riots in Petrograd  on July 14-16 were not the work ofthe Bolsheviks so much as the  result  of the general discontentfollowing on the offensive and the  sacrifices it entailed.It is true that the Bolshevik  leaders joined in and tried togive the riots a definite political aharacter, but. the movementwas not organised in advance as was the November Revolution.The  action of the Bolsheviks  called  down a torrent of abuse ontheir heads, Kerenski describing their conduct as a &quot;stab in theback to the army defending the country&quot;.  It also gave rise tothe publication of a series  of documents  - not to be the last -which claimed  to prove that  the Bolshevik leaders were in Germanpay.  The fact that they had travelled through Germany on theirway to Russia  lent credence  to the  story, but even the ProvisionalGovernment - however much Kerenski desired to do so. - founditself incapable of prosecuting Lenin and the others on the basisof this evidence.   The charges wore emphatically denied by Lenin,
Zinoviev and Kamenev, while Trot-ski protested that during theriot s he and his colleagues had urged the troops to abandonthe armed character of the demonstration.     The continued state of discontent and disorder at the frontduring July and Augustj so far from discrediting the Bolsheviks,gained for them increased popularity among the working classes.At various elections in factories and works in PetrogradBolshevik delegates headed the polls;  at municipal elections inSeptember the Bolsheviks were beaten by the Social Revolutionariesonly by very small majorities.  The constant difficultiesKerenski met with, both in the formation of his Cabinets and inhis relations  with Kornilov, steadily weakened the prestige ofthe Government.   It was obvious that matters were coming to ahead, and that the only solution of Russia1s difficulties wouldbe some form of dictatorship.  The high-water mark of  thebourgeoisie was reached at the Moscow Conference at the end ofAugust, and it was clear that the movement in favour of amilitary dictatorship would not be delayed much longer.  In faceof such a movement Kerenski&apos;s position became well-nighimpossible.  He faced the prospect of a dictatorship, though hefeared it, and It is difficult to see how the final misunder-standing with Kornilov could have been avoided.  Then it came,Kerenski was of necessity driven into the arms of the Left,and the Bolshevik leaders, who had  been in prison since July,were released.  But those days of anxiety were the decisive daysin Kerenski1s career.  After the Kornilov rebellion Kerenski&apos;sformer policy of conciliation was bankrupt.  He could not takesides with the counter-revolution, nor could he throw in hislot whole-heartedly vrith the forces of the Revolution.   Thelast two months of his Government were an uphill struggleagainst ever-increasing odds.  They were aL$o the decisive months
in the history of the Revolution.  The counter-revolution hadbeen defeated, but could the Revolution triumph?   Now was themoment for the Bolsheviks.  In their opinion there was nolonger any security for the Revolution in the hands of Kerenski,for against a weak Government the counter-revolution wouldagain raise its head.   The Bolshevik leaders were now at large,and the history of September and October shows the steadygrowth of their ideas both in Petrograd and Moscow,  pjeloNaroda, the organ of the Social Revolutionaries, writing onSeptember 25, two days beSore the Democratic Conference inretrograd, gave expression to the growing anxiety:  &quot;Everywherethe Bolsheviks are Paving the most unexpected successes.  Thisis all the more remarkable as the Bolsheviks, who hitherto havehad no support among the peasantry, have new succeeded ingaining one-third of the seats at the Zemstvo elections.  IL IStime to say frankly that their success has been assisted by theanti-democratic policy of the Government during the last fewweeks&quot;.     Kerenski&apos;s final expedient to cope with the situation createdby Kornilov&apos;s rebellion in September was to adopt the adviceof the Soviet and summon a Democratic Conference in Petrograd.Though he secured the presence in this Assembly of a largenumber of moderates, it was clear that the opposition to hispolicy of coalition had greatly Increased during the last fewweeks.   The Democratic Conference, which finally met onSeptember&apos;27, was in itself a compromise.  The MenshevikExecutive Committee of the Soviet wanted it not only as a counter-blast to the Moscow Conference in August, in which the bourgeoisiehad taken so prominent a part, but as a means of frustrating theBolshevik scheme of summoning an All-Russia Congress of Soviets.
Kerenski probably hoped that  the Conference would vote in favourof his policy;  if so, he was disappointed.  The vote was aconfused one, as was to be expected from so mixed an assembly,and Kerenski decided to ignore  it.  After negotiating withTsereteli, he resolved to proceed with his own ideas in forminga Government and in setting up  a Provisional Parliament whichwould be purely consultative.     In the light of subsequent events it is clear that thisstep was fatal.  It was a direct challenge to the Soviets, andit was accepted in that sense by the Bolsheviks, who were bythis time the only driving force in them.  Trotski now becamemore and more the spokesman of  the Bolsheviks.  On October 8the elections to the Executive  Committee of the PetrogradSoviet resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Bolsheviks,and at the same time Trotski was elected President.  There couldno longer be any doubt that the Bolsheviks were making a bid forpower.  The Provisional Parliament opened on October 20.  It con-tained a large number of Bolsheviks, but, after a speech of pro-test by Trotski on the opening  day, the whole party boycottedthe proceedings.   They had made up their minds that inKerenski&apos;s hands the Revolution was failing, that, if theydelayed, the counter-revolution would again raise its head.&quot;Never was the danger to the Revolution so great as it is now&quot; -Virrote Rabochi Put (the new organ of the Bolsheviks) on October13.   &quot;Without Bonapartist methods, not only Kerenskirs Govern-ment, but even the so-called revolutionary democracy led by theSocial Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, is unable to gvern.The policy of compromise is everywhere collapsing in disgrace.At a time when it was necessary to transform the entire orderin the country from top to bottom and to establish a popularGovernment, a Coalition was formed that could not possibly
solve the problems of-^he Revolution,,  That Coalition, led to theunfortunate offensive of July I, the order for which was signedby the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries.  It was a trumpcard for I^ilhelm and led to the Korniiov rebellion.  After theKornilov rebellion -the:Bolsheviks- should .have seized the reinsof. power and transferred them to the Soviets&quot;.     A few weeks later the Bolsheviks acted on this advice^.  Theirincreasing propaganda, among the Petrograd garrison led to theformation of the Military Revolutionary Committee on October 25.The meeting of the All-Russia Congress of Soviets ims announcedfor November 3.  This was to have been the signal for theRevolution,, but at the last moment zhe Congress was postponed.The Bolsheviks now decided to act.  Their preparations were care-fully laid.  On the night of November 5 they seised importantposts in Petrograd and in a few days were complete masters of thecapitalr     The Bolshevik Government has already enjoyed the longestlife of any Government since the Revolution.  It too has attemptedto tackle the different problems of the war and of the revolutionwhich the Provisional Government had failed to solve, but theresult has been the temporary collapse of Russia as a great powerand its rapid disintegration.  How far the sufferings of Russiaand the desertion of the Allies at the most critical period of thewar can be placed to the account of the Bolsheviks both beforeand since their accession to power, a further article will attemptto explain.                                                 5.4,18.
