T                  AI^TI-RECRUITIi^G STRIVES.      IX-ORAKDP:&apos;  Y THE FI/ISTER OF EATIONAL service.          As the V.&apos;ar Cabinet are aware, various attempts havebeen made by Rank and Pile Committees to bring about  atrikesagainst the recruiting policy of the Government,  Examples pfthese are the Conference of District Committees convened byA. Schofield at Manchester on the 21st March and denounced bythe Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of Engineersthe national /Hied Trades Joint Committee  (L. l-agson,Stanningley);  and the South Lanark ?&apos;Iners Reform Committee(James Hogg) who are not only inspiring activities inLanarkshire but also in South r&apos;sles.   The date for whicha strike is aimed is 6th April.          I understand that the Finister of Munitions and theHome Secretary have placed these cases in the hands of theDirector.of Public Prosecutions with a view to securing legalproceedings, if sufficient evidence is available.          In the event of any anti-recruiting strikesoccurring I propose, unless the V.sv Cabinet otherwisedirects, at once to call up for military service all  strikersof military age,.5/4/18.
