idPRO-  Section Z. TO   l^fft G5 e for this Section a revised version,circulatedCERT- at the meeting of the War Cabinet, by Sir A. Gaddes.OJf      The Committee agreed to insert a further drafting ame:id-      mont suggested by Mr. Gibbon.      Section 3      rnsert&quot;&quot;a&quot;*2ub-section dealing with legal procoedings under      the Refeine forces Acts?  and a sub-section dealing with      powor to call up men for medical examination.

THE CHAIRMAN next stated that the Y/ar Cabinet  had very      strongly e:cpressed the  view that the tribunal  system      was the cause of considerable delay In th-e recruiting      of men, and that there  could, not be one system of tri-      bunals  for Great Britain and another for Ireland.   The      Cabinet had,  therefore,  requested the Committee  to re-      assemble in order to devise a tribunal machinery appli-      cable  to the whole of the United Kingdom in its  essential      features.    The  Chairman suggested that perhaps  the      Cabinet1s  wish could be  met by making Section  3  (b) readj-      &quot;For determining the constitute on and the powers  of the      tribunals,  etc&quot;,    $his  wnuld&quot;Enable the  tribunals to be      made nominative  throughout  the United Kingdom,      MR.  EAYSS  WISHER hoped  that the  Cabinet realised  that      delay  in obtaining recruits is mainly due to the  fact      that the decisions of the tribunals  and Appeal Tribun-      als, are constantly being set  aside  by the  issue  of      protecting certificates.    He  could not  allow  the  charge      to go unchallenged In the  House  of  Commons,  that tho      Tribunals  were the cause  of delay.      SIR    GSDDDS thought in  Ireland it  should  bo  possible      to  appoint a Commissioner for  each  County,  with Sub-      Oonimis si oners, to act as  tribunals.    Such  Commissioners      should  have power to postpone  the  calling up of men, and      to grant what in effect v;&apos;ould bo permanent  exemption.      Considerable discussion  ensued as to tho best  type of      tribunal,  and it was ultimately  agreed to bo desirable      to retain  the Appeal Tribunals,  and&quot;to take power to      make the local tribunals  nominative,  to reduce their      size, and  limit  the right of  appeal.    This roneral      scheme  could bo  applied to  Ireland,  but thore would ne-      cessarily  bo coiisiderable  differences  in working it in      Ireland.
MR. DUUiii thought it would he possible to staff theIrish tribunals largely with officials of the LocalGovernment Board, ana the Board of Agriculture, to-gother vtith representatives of the Army, and the Pol-ice,Tho Committee proceeded to redraft Section 3 of theSill, so as to give effect to the above decision, andprovide, jntor alia, for determining the constitutionand powers of tribunals, tho establishment of specialtribunals, tho grant or renewal or review of certifi-cates of coemption, and the regulation and limitationoi&apos; applications for e::aaption.2, Whitehall Gardens,     Q if 15th April, 1918.
