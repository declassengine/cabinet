Vice  Admiral m BOB,       Admiral BB BOH explained the  objects of the Meeting.   Tho Jotnt^onncil was asked  to  consider  the possibility of sending   an expedition to ARGEMGJEII,  with a view  to  securing  tho stores   belonging to the Allies.       The Allied Haval Council had already met together   in London to consider this question,  and Admiral D   BOH read the   report then drawn up,       Admiral DE BOH summed up this report by drawing particular   attention to the heavy burdens which  such an expedition would   impose on the Wavy,  i  burdens  which, however,  would be of no   consideration provided the military interests rendered tfeem   imperative,       from his point of view the military objectives  would   bo the following j*-       (1)  Protection  of the Stores.       (E)  Tho advantages from a politic  and economic  point of            view of preventing thtTuorth of jmssia from passing            into the hands of the Germans^       As regards the protection of the stores,  it would be   necessary to destroy  these, as we do not  possess the  means for   bringing them away.       As regards the political and economic  advantages of such an   expedition, tho Allied laval  Council was  not  in  a position to[   express an opinion, the question falling  outside the  province of   tho Iavy*     He asked General K&amp;YGAHE to give his opinion from tho militarypoint of view.solveGeneral \73YGAHD replied that the problem was one easy to     The Military Representatives calculated that two to threeInfantry Brigades and two or three groups of artillery would be  -necessary for such an expedition.   How, the Allies are not ableto set froe, under present conditions, a similar number of troops.General BAAYLI1IS0H
General RAWLINSON suggested that further discussion of the question should he postponed, pending the arrival of General KNOX.

General BLISS stated that Admiral DE BON possessed a copy of General KNOX&apos;S report and suggested that it should be read.

This proposal was approved and General KNOX&apos;S report was read, as well as a memorandum by Captain PROCTOR.

Admiral DE BON expressed the view that these reports which chiefly dealt with the political aspect of the question, possessed one military objective :- the maintenance of an Allied Base at ARCHANGEL, which would act as a nucleus for the assembly of the Russian disaffected and repentant elements.

General WEYGAND drew attention to the isolated position and distance of ARCHANGEL.

The Joint  Meeting of the Allied Naval Council and the Military Representatives of the supreme War Council then expressed the following opinion :-

Intervention at ARCHABGEL.

From the military point of view in the conditions actually prevailing no military resources whatever seem available for an expedition to ARCHAHGEL.

From the Naval point of view it would be extremely difficult to withdraw naval material either for the purpose of transportation or fighting and to devote it to this expedition.

If this shipping was so devoted, its loss would be heavily felt both for anti-submarine purposes and those of transportation.

The Council is conscious of the importance of preventing, the stores accumulated at this point from falling into the hands of the enemy and is of opinion that all possible steps must be taken to ensure the destruction  of these stores.

Admiral DE BON next considered the question of PORT MURMANSK. He drew attention to the fact that we already  have Naval forces at this port. The maintenance of these forces implied equally the occupation of the sea  coast along which the railway line is situated.

The same difficulties, namely, want of troops, make themselves evident.

General WEYGAND drew particular attention to the advantage which exists in holding MURMANSK as long as possible as a line of retreat for our people.

Admiral SIMS invited attention to paragraph (g) of the report of the special Meeting of the representatives of the Allied Naval Council, hold in London, and asked for some explanations regarding the steps which the British authorities proposed to take in this region.

Admiral DE BON


     Admiral DID BOH expressed the opinion,  after a  short  discuss-ion,  that this Ooiuioil was not oalled upon  to express any opinionon this question.   He proposed that the following  Resolutionshould ho passed, and this was agreed to :-     Intervention at !?iJEMAHSKa          The same considerations arc- equally aj)pli cable  to     IHJRIiAHSZ so far as a military expedition specially     directed to this point is concerned.          The Council is hov/ever of opinion so  far  as this last     place is concerned, that the H&amp;val steps actually being     taken should be continued in order to  retain this place     in the possession of the Allies as long as possible.2. y:hitchall Gardens.  . &apos;.!.
