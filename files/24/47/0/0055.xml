FFeeft ewded 30ZA MarcA, 1918.                            NAVAL  OPERATIONS. ,   Minelaying operations in the Heligoland Bight have been continued.               North Ses   . On 23rd March the Special Service Vessel &quot; Glendale&apos;&quot; captured the German s.s.&quot; Valeria,&quot; with a cargo of iron ore, about 83 miles west of Vega Fjord,  Norway.  The&quot; Valeria &quot; was abandoned and sunk after the crew of 16 had been taken prisoners.    On 28th March the Flotilla Leader &quot; Abdiel,&quot; with destroyers of the 20th Flotilla,sank three enemy armed trawlers in the North Sea,  and captured their entire crews,consisting of 3 officers and 69 men, there being no casualties on either side.   The trawlerswere each armed with a 4-inch&apos;gun. and one  was also fitted with W/T.  Prisoners statedthat  a short  time  before capture a W/T message  was sent to Wilhelmshavea reportingthe presence of  our destroyers, but no enemy vessels other than those  captured  weresighted.    R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on Naval duty, have carried oat a number Flandersof patrols, the following being the principal incidents reported :                      area.    On 24th March four enemy machines were destroyed  and  two driven down out ofcontrol, and  a hostile balloon was brought  down in flames. On the same  day bombswere dropped on the Coastal Motor Boat Base at  Blankenberghe and on  the Ateliers dela  Marine, Ostend.    On 26th  March a  formation  of eight enemy machines was attacked, four of themachines being destroyed ;  and bombs were again dropped on the Coastal Motor  BoatBase at Blankenberghe and on Zeebrugge Mole.    On 27th March Vlisseghem Aerodrome was attacked by machine-gun  fire.    On 25th March the Armed Drifter &quot; Border Lads &quot; was blown up and sunk 2 miles Casualties.east  of the Tyne,  four men being  lost.  It  is believed the vessel was torpedoed, as thevicinity has been searched and no mines have been found.    On 26th  March the Mine-carrier, &quot; Lady  Cory Wright,&quot;  was torpedoed and  sunk15  miles  south-west  from  the Lizard, 6  officers and 32  men being  lost.   She wascarrying mines to the Mediterranean.    On 27th March the Destroyers &quot; Kale &quot; and &quot; Exe &quot; ran into a minefield in theNorth Sea, the former being sunk and the latter  damaged ;  1  officer and 40 men  from&quot; Kale,&quot; and 3 officers and  2 men from &quot; Exe &quot; were lost.    On 28th March the Armed Boarding Steamer  &quot; Tithonus &quot;  was torpedoed and  sunk51 miles from Girdleness, 4  men being lost.                           *&quot;(0 1083) Wt.   55 4/18 H&amp;S
ATTACK UPON ENEMY  SUBMARINES.Submarinesoperating.    During the week from 13 to 17 large enemy submarines have been located, 5 of tkem-being of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type.  Of the latter, one was homeward boundprobably in the North Sea. three were to the westward of Portugal,  and the other wasoperating in the vicinity of  the  Canary  Islands.   The remaining large boats have beenchiefly in the Irish Sea, to the South of Ireland, and in the English  Channel, in whichareas and in the North Sea  considerable activity has been experienced.Actions        The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home^marfnT ^aters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and, u marines. ajgQ ^Q number of submarines destroyed : * Nature of Craft.

    The total tonnage which up to the present has been reported as lost during the weekis less  than in any week this year excepting that ended 19th January, when 13 vesselsaggregating 27,410 tons were sunk.  The figures for the week, following the heavy lossesin the  two previous weeks, provide a further illustration of the necessity of taking a longview in regard, to submarine losses.   The result of these  satisfactory figures is that thelosses in March, which appeared likely to be a bad month, compare  not unfavourablywith recent months.    The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and Losses ofof losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British merchant ^ritisl1steamships of over 500 tons gross register ;  and the table in Appendix II shows by trades in6^^^as regards such ships, the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailingto and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.    The British tonnage engaged in Overseas trades this week is practically the same asthe high figure recorded in last week&apos;s Appreciation, and although the number of vesselslost in these trades has  been the same each week,  the vessels sunk this week are  of verymuch less  tonnage, with the result that the percentage of losses to sailings in these tradesworks  out  at  .99 as  against 1.51 in the previous  week.  In Coasting and Cross-Channeltraffic  the tonnage engaged is greater  than in the previous week and the losses only alittle more than one-third, the percentage of losses to  sailings  being .25 as against .80last week,  while as  regards all  trades  to and from the  United Kingdom the percentageis .53  as against 1.09 &quot;last week.   No  British  vessels  engaged in other trades  havebeen lost  during  the  week.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement  of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas inas well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by whichenemy craft and  by mine, classified according to areas.                               vessels lost.    The features of this week are the great reduction of  enemy activity in the English-Channel and the Meoliterranean, particularly in the latter area, where, so far as  reportshave at present been received, only three attacks were made, resulting in one vessel beingsunk and another damaged.  It is also a noteworthy fact that the proportion of attackswhich  were unsuccessful dming the week is very much  greater than for many weekspast.                                 ENEMY MINES.    Enemy minelaying has this week taken place in the Harwich and Clyde areas, the Minelaying.minefield in the  latter area on this occasion being laid outside the Cumbraes.  Themerchant ship shown  below as having been sunk by mine this week drifted across aknown field off the Needles whilst  being towed into harbour after collision.   In additionanother merchant vessel was damaged in the Mersey by striking a sunken mine, and specialsteps are being taken to prevent, as far as possible, vessels proceeding over localities wherethere  are unexploded mines on the  bottom and  where there  is an insufficient depth ofwater.

Merohaat-men.MOVEMENTS  OF ENEMY SHIPS.    During the week under review  the  number  of  merchant  ships trading betweenGermany and Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat has not been so great as&apos;in recentweeks,; only six having arrived at and nine having sailed  from such ports.   No enemyships  have entered or left Rotterdam.                ......   __________                   3FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.               FEANCE.    There has been a most regrettable accident to the French submarine &quot;Watt,&quot; inwhich the commanding officer and one man &quot;were killed, and four others wounded,&apos;andthe submarine sustained some damage.  The  submarine came to the  surface close toa  British convoy  and immediately  submerged again, whereupon  depth charges weredropped  by  the escorting ships, which brought the submarine to the surface, when firewas opened on her and continued until the French flag was shown.                                  ;    RUSSIA.     No definite arrangements have yet been made to destroy the ships of the Baltic Fleet, and unless the co-operation of the Bolshevik Government can be obtained their destruction will be difficult to accomplish.  The Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Razvasov) informed the Naval Attache that any attempt on the part of the officers to prepare the ships for destruction immediately led to agitation against  them as  counter-revolutionaries, and on 20th March the Commander-in-Chief was arrested on this  pretext at the instigation of the Central Bait. Mr. Lockhart has now been asked to find out from Trotsky what policy he proposes to  take with regard to the Baltic Fleet, and to point out that in view of the entire lack of its fighting efficiency and the enormous superiority of  the German Fleet, its destruction  is the only hope of ensuring that the enemy make no use of it.     Reports have been received which &quot;show that the four battle cruisers building at Petrograd cannot possibly be completed under 1^ years at the normal rate of peace time construction. :     The ships  which  are believed to have been at Reval before the German occupation are  5 cruisers,  13 transports, 5 old  submarines, 11 minesweepers, 1 netlayer, 2 seaplane carriers, and 34 harbour craft (motor launches, &amp;c).  Of these the cruisers and transports were evacuated to Helsingfors, but the remainder were probably captured.  Some 300 Russian officers at Reval (including the captains of the cruisers &quot; Rurik &quot; and &quot; Bogatyr &quot;) elected to remain with the enemy, probably  to save themselves from  massacre.     The Russian Transport Flotilla was removed from  Odessa to Theodosia (Crimea) before the former was occupied by  the  Germans.     Reports received  from &quot; Suffolk &quot; indicate that the Post Office and the Telegraph Office at Vladivostock were taken over  by the Bolsheviks on 25th March, and that all communication with the interior through these  channels has  ceased.  The  Bolsheviks will shortly  be  in complete control, but the captain of &quot; Suffolk &quot; has been* instructedto act in  concert with U.S. and1 Japanese ships, should necessity arise, to prevent theremoval of the accumulated stores.  &apos;INaval Staff,    4th April, 1918.[Appendices.
