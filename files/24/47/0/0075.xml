I circulate for the information .of the Tjar Cabinetthe following brief account of the work of the Board ofTrade during the month of March, 1918.     The Mission sent by the Board of Trade to Egypt tonegotiate arrangements for controlling.the EgyptianCotton Crop has now returned to London having completeda scheme for acquiring the crop which has receivedCabinet approval.     A Commission is to be set up inEgypt by Proclamation under martial law which willpurchase all cotton sent to Alexandria after August 1stnext at prices based on 42 dollars per Kantar (aboutls.9d. per lb.) ior Pally Good Pair SakellaridesCotton.    After that date no new licences for theexport of cotton from Dgypt will be issued except forcotton which has been purchased by the Commission andall existing licences will be cancelled except licencesfor cotton already purchased for export.    The Commissionwill have compulsory powers to acquire all unlicensedcotton at Alexandria .and the purchase will embrace theresidue qf:.;the prsu^r,t seasonfs crop as well as thenext croc.    They will also have power to take overstorage accommodation aid cotton pressing plant ifrequired,   There wilT&apos;be no direct /. compulsion on.theCOMMiSCS MS INDUSTRY.
 growers to send their cotton to Alexandria for sale, but they will not be able to export cotton so with- held from, sale whilst the scheme regains  in force.      The Commission will undertake  the storage,  in- surance and pressing of the cotton  they pur-chase, and the payment of export duty  on the  cotton  ex- ported,  and will sell it free on board on the  basis of 48 dollars per.Kantar (about  2/- per lb.)  for F.G.F.  Sakellarides.     Cotton  of other qualities will  be  graded into  a limited-number of types  and purchased  and sold according to  a schedule  of  prices which will be drawn  up  as soon as possible. Exports of  cotton  to  the  various  allied  and neutral coun- tries will be conducted up  to- the limits  of rations for each country  determined from time  to  time  by , Hi s Ma j esty&apos;s Government,      For the  purpose  of financing the  scheme funds will  be  advanced  in  equal quantities up to a total.of  20 millions  sterling by  the Treasury and by banking  houses  in Egypt,  the advances  of  the latter being guaranteed  by&apos;  the Egyptian  Government..  /my profits  resulting after  the payment, of expenses (including interest.on  capital &quot;advanced) will be  ., . disposed of&quot; by arrangement  between His Majestyfs  . Government and  the Egyptian Government..   ..; 1 So  far as  can be  effected the machinery of  the. existing export houses  will be utilised for the grading, purchase and  export of  the cotton, &quot;and  the ordinary channels of  trade  will  be  interfered with as  little  as  possible.      It  is now expected that the  charge on the       MT Ofil Treasury for  the  cotton operatives * unemployment

Its        membership has been  extended to include representatives        of Nottingham and Leicester.             The arrangements in connection with the appointment        of the Paper Controller are now complete.             The Paper-making&apos;mat oriels (Heine Produced) Order.        was made by&apos;the Board on karch 13th.   It prohibits the.  -        purchase or  sale of certainmateric Is destined for the        manufacture  :of paper,&apos; so  far as thoy are produced or       -&quot;Collected at home, except: under a permits granted by the        Paper Controller.           -JAL ^        &apos; I have^r&apos;ec-eTve-d :a;-de^iaticn:-froia&apos;:&apos;the London &quot;        Chamber of Commerceand other&apos; Trade&apos; Associations in        connection with the  Patents, and  Designs  and Trade Marks        Bills.    The principal  points  dealt  with wore (1)        the  prolongation of  tho terra of  Patents  in cases  where        tho  patentees have suffered loss by  reason of the  war,        and&quot; (E)  the  proposal  to remove from  the  Register word
trade marks which are the names of articles.     I have also received deputations from theTrade Marks Owners&apos; Association in connection withthe Trade Marks Bill, and from manufacturers ofhoot and shoe machinery in connexion with Section38 of the Patents and Designs Act, 1907.    The Patents and Designs Bill and the TradeMarks Bill are being considered and re-drafted inthe light of the criticisms and representationsmade;:P:td; the Board since - their introduction into . .the House of Commons in November last.     The Ministry of Beconstruction have suggested   TRANSPORTa Committee to deal with the whole cue sti on ofstorage and transit during demobilisation;  thoDoard of Trade have agreed and the proposal isbeing further discussed.     &quot;Further progress has been made With the con-sideration of the possibility of a fast Anglo- -Italian Railway goods service via a train ferrybetween i^ance and England.     The question of Canal development is being takenup with a view to forming some estimate of the trafficlikely to pass on an improved system of waterways.     The British Aluminium CompanyJs Scottish        WATER POwER.^aterpower scheme is awaiting the decision of theHouse of Lords authorities, who have been informedof the interest taken by the Department in theBill.
PUBLIC  SERVICES  ADMINISTRATION     I -have discussed, with the Railway ExecutiveCommittee certain proposals for the further reductionof passenger traffic;  involving a decrease in trainservice of about 40 per cent on July 1913 and re-strlctions on the conditions under which both seasontickets and ordinary tickets are issued.    Suggestionson the subject will be put forward by the Committee.     I am also in communication with Mr. Churchill,Lord Derby and Sir Sric Gedd.es regarding the reductionof the number of privilege tickets issued by theirrespective departments.     Civilian travelling hasgone up very considerably, as compared both with 1913and last year, but while a reduction in such travellingwill help the railway companies it will net alonesuffice and it may be necessary to deal with goodstraffic as well, if the railways are to meet the callsmade on them     Among other measures designed to reduce the move-men - of coal in the country I propose that tramwayservices should where possible be reduced.     The necessary steps can, it is thought, be takenthrough the Tramways (Board cf Trade) Committee whichconsists of representatives of both Municipal andcompany undertakings.     Owing to the reduction in the quantity of coalavailable for gas and electricity undertakings in con-sequence of the diversion to other essential pin-poses ofthe Coasting Steamers by which coal is usually broughtto London and other southern ports, an  Order has been
 made under He^iLsiions 2$ -and 2JJ of tho Defence of  the Realm Regulations  placing the following  restrictions upon the  Consumption  of gas  and  electricity:    (1) All consumers  of gas  and  electricity  in  the 23       counties  South of&quot;a line  from trie  Severn to the       Wash must reduce their consumption as comparedwith       tho corresponding  quarters  of 1916 or 191.7 bv one       sixth.  This aom hot apply to Munition  Works,       railways  or hospitals,    (2) Hot  meals are  not  to  he cooked or  served in       -restaurants, hotels,&quot;clubs,  refreshment.houses,       &amp;c*, &quot;between 9.30D.SI.  ana  5a*nh and lights in       the  dining  rooms of each places must he  put out       at  lQp,m;    (3) Theatres, Music  Halls  and  other places of enter-       tadamant must  not ho  lighted between 10.30p.m. and       lop.m. cn the  following day;    (4) All  shop window  lighting  is prohibited;       The  last  three restrictions apply  to the whole of       Great Britain.       The  Order takes  effect as  from April 2nd, 1918.      In view of the necessity for a more drastic comb-ing out of dock labour  for the- Army. I issued an Orderon the 26th March withdrawing&apos; all certificates of exemp-tion.of such men between the  a*?es of 10 vears and 8 monthsand 25 years, which had been  issued by Port Labour Committees.The measures to be taken to fill the vacancies (estimated at1,000) caused bv the&apos;callinr  un of such of those men as arein medical category  A and of any others  who&quot;&quot;may be  similar-ly called up are  under consideration by the 7ar Cabinet.     Questions as to possible changes in  the  mode of  pur-chasing and the responsibility for distribution  of meat  forthe allied armies have been referred to  the V/ar Cabinetfor decision.
MISCELLANEOUS00,iL   COIOTOL.     Price of Coal for, Export.     A brokerage  chargeon exported&apos;coal amounting on an average  to  about  6d.per ton, or about f million sterling has  been trans-ferred from trie exporting merchant&apos;&apos; to  the colliery bya Direction of the Controller of.Coal  Mines  dated  2ndMarch.     The price of coal to Danish buyers was  increasedbv 10 kroner per ton as from  5th  March at the  reouestof the foreign-Office by way of reply  to  the refusalof the Danes to supply their surplus butter  to  thiscountry at a reasonable price.     Allocation of Trade in South  Wales.   with a  viewto meeting dissatisfaction among labour arising out ofinequality in working &quot;at the different  collieries&apos;a&apos;1&quot;-&apos;&apos;  -scheme has been introduced under which the quantity ofcoal which each colliery&apos;may sell  is limited to an;amount roughl? equivalent to 5 days1 output  per week-.                ...      . \ *   * -- ;      - .                   * .

It is probable, that afurther large demand for timber for Prance will /shortlybe received.         TOBACCO COSTKOL. -     The position oi stocks in this country  shows no
 improvement during last month.    Whilst withdrawals from Bond amounted to approximately 6,500 tons,  tho total imports  during that period were only  about 3,500 tons.              &apos;   ROAD TRANSPORT.      A Central Advisory Committee on Road Transport has been  appointed to assist  the Road Transport  Board, This Committee is  representative of the principal interests concerned with Road Transport.      A-now regulation under the  Defence of  the Roalm Regulations is in  course of preparation v/hich will give the  Board the necessary  power to control road transport vehicles.      The  general policy of the Board will be to  ob- tain the/desired economies by voluntary means as far as  possible and  to hold the powers in reserve, so that they need only be  used if occasion arises.  -    -  As a preliminary measure it is proposed:        (a) to register all power driven vehicles and  :        -.  four wheeled horse drawn vehicles-having, a        .;   load capacity of  over 20cwt.;.        -(b) to issue permits  in  respect of  such  vehicles             as registered;        (c) to prepare a scheme  of priority classification             so that in case of emergency, vehicles  c&amp;rry-             ing  goods in a low class of priority may he-----           employed to carry goods in a higher  class.
     The above summary deals only with questionswhich seem likely to interest my colleagues, and does notnot profess to be an account of the ordinary de-partmental work of the Board of Trade, or to dealwith all the important questions considered by theDepartment, among which I may mention the following:-the institution of trade committees, the supply offodder for horses, and the regulation of the saleand purchase of horses; . steps taken to fosterBritish trade abroad, particularly in the Levant andSouth America;  the preparation by the StatisticsDepartment of various special compilations preparedfor the use of Government Departments or forpublication, and the administration of the provisionsof the Trading with the Bnem? Acts.                       -ka a. ui.dri.uui.of Trade,fifVi  Anvil   10&quot;P
