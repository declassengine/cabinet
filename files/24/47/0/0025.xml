Section 1(8)   In view ox tho importance of presorving religious mini3-   trations in the country, it was agreed  to provide for a   right of appeal to the Central Tribunal,   Section 1 (3)   iir, Hayes&apos;Aisher said he. was in favour  of omitting  this   sub-section.   The country would always give all the foroes   required for the lavy, and Parliament would in  any  oase of   emergency he ready to pass a Bill to that end,   11R. R0.TX&quot;.T8 agreed, and thought public  opinion would resent   any proposal for applying conscription  to the Navy,
             MR. HD1IR0 suggested, and the C*maiiii^*^*^^             drafting amendments to the sub-section as drawn.             The Chairman thought it was not desirable to ohangc             the title of the Act. even if this sub-section were             retained.                  The Committee agreed to draw the special                  attention of the tfar Cabinet, and of the                  Admiralty, to the proposal. 3HTI.0.US  3. It was agreed to add a Clause making the Military Ser-H ALLIED     vice (Conventions with Allied States) Act, 1917, ap-3?ES,         plicable to  the present Bill.[BUMS    4. SIR A. GEDDES said that, after consultation with hisAND          Recruiting Department,  he regretted to have to  adviseiPTIOUS.     against the  acceptance of the arrangements for  tri-             bunals and exemptions,  which the Committee had  approved             on the previous day.             He briefly reviewed the stages through which the dis-             cussion had  passed,    His instructions from the War             Cabinet (War Cabinet  371 Jiinute 9)  had been to  carry             out what almost amounted to a levy en masse,  subject             to as  little industrial dislocation $s possible.  In             the original draft of the  Bill,  to give effect  to this             (G.T.4057),  he  had proposed to withdraw all existing             exemptions and  all power to grant  exemptions, and to             supersede  tribunals by  advisory bodies,  which would             act primarily in the  interest of the  recruiting auth-             ority,  but whose advice  the Minister  of national Ser-             vico 7/ould not  be  bound  to  follow.    In the  Bill as             it emerged from the Committee  on the  previous evening,             the tribunal system remained,  with  rights  of  applica-             tion from  individuals, with statutory rights to the             publication  of  schemes,  etc.    He  was advised that with             such machinery  there would  bo  a break in the flow of             men to  the colours, especially in the .period of trans-             ition  from the  present system to the  new system.   In             any case so  long as any  weight was  given to tribunals,             the working  of  tho recruiting machine would be  arrested.             From the standpoint of rapid  recruiting his Department             would be better off witSLts present powers of cancella-             tion under the  Military Service  Act,  1918, coupled with             certain modifications in the method of exemption, than             under the Committee^ proposals.             Sir J.  Seymour  Lloyd said that  the present Committee&apos;s             scheme,  in effect, imposed fresh machinery on the ro-             cruiting authority, when what was wanted was a  simpli-             fioation sf  the  existing machinery.   The original pro-             poeal of the Minister of National Service had been to             retain  the personnel of the tribunals  In an advisory          ,   capacity, aid to give them little or  no power of do-             laying  the flow  of men.
 SIR A. GEDDSS recommended that in the Third Revise of tho Draft Bill now under discussion, the Committee shouia delete Section 2(1) and (2), retaining (3)  with some drafting changes, modifying  (4), and in tho Second Schedule deleting the cancellation of Section 2 of the Military Service Act, 1918.   The effect of this would he to scrap the proposed group system.   The Director- General of lational Service would retain his present power to cancel exemptions on occupational  grounds,  but the grounds of appeal to the tribunals would be narrowed to those of conscientious objection,  and of individual hardship..   Those latter would be defined and standard- ized,,   This scheme was not substantially different  from what had been suggested by the President of the Local Government Board,  and the Secretary for Scotland in  their Memoranda to the  War Cabinet (G.2?.  4055 and 4058).   In order to  obtain tho maximum number  of men at a pinch, he still  held it  would be better  to bo rid  of tribunals and to sweep away all individual  rights of  exemption. But perhaps  tiie Government had &quot;missed the  tide&quot; for launching such a  scheme,  and in view  of possible parlia- mentary opposition,  it might now  be preferable to move on to the lines originally indicated  by Mr.  Hayes Fisher and Mr. Munro. Considerable discussion took place  as to whether the Committee should  adhere substantially to the  Bill as now drafted,  and  should send it forward to  tho  V/ar Cab- inet together with a fresh alternative  clause  embodying the schemo new  put forward by Sir A.  Geddes. MR.  HAYI3S 1&apos;ISHER,  MR.  MUNRO,  MR.  DUKE,  and  MR.  ROBERTS were all  in  favour  of  retaining the system  of tribunals, and believed that  such a  oourse would,  on the wholo, furnish most men for the Forces.. LORD MILKER,  who arrived at  the Meeting at  this  stage, represented  to the  Committee  the  supreme necessity of obtaining tho maximum  number  of men,  and said the War Cabinet were  quite prepared  to face serious Parliament- ary trouble  in  order to  obtain the men.   At the same timo  it was  very desirable that the Committee should send forward to the  Cabinet  one set of proposals and not  two.liR. .DU32E  suggested that a compromise might be reached by  putting in the Bill a clause empowering His Majesty by  Order  in  Couiesil, in a cose of grave national omer- gency, to cancel or withdraw all certificates of ox- emption,  or  any particular olass of such certificates. SIR  A. .G3DDBS said if  this suggestion were adopted hewould then be prepared to drop his proposal. SIR  J. SEYMOUR LLOYD pointed out that the position would thenbe  that in a  grave and abnormal national situation,  a Proclamation would be issued cancelling all  certificates,
PS81RSIORT  TOTHE WARCABIIST.   and making it possible to call up men automatically.   Such cancellation would apply to personal and occu**   pational exemptions, and to exemptions on conscientious   grounds.        The Committee agreed to insert in the Bill        a clause giving power by proclamation to        withdraw certificates of exemption in tho        case of imminent national danger, or grave        emergency,5, The Committee amended and approved a Draft Report   for submission to the &quot;war Cabinet (G 204), to ac-   company the Bill as now amended.U,B.You are requested to return the above with anycorrections,          A printed,copy of the Committee^ Report andMinutes will be circulated later as 6, 204,Thomas Jones       (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens,     S,W.l,3rd April, 1918,
