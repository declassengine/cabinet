C ...3IH&apos;ii T.4132.;;-IU;iS I; G^bo,.KY TOMemorandum by the IArm;/ Ooioneil.      On the  11th Alar oh,  1918,  a Memorandum by the Ad jut an t- General was  submitted pointing out the position into which the Army  had fallen in regard to men.  and drawing attention to the fact  that as far as could be foreseen on that date,  the Infantry in France during April would be 43,000 under strength.      The events of the last few days have more than justified the Tiew taken  then by the Army Council, the deficit,  so far as can be  ascertained today in France being 4-9,000.      A  Balance  Sheet marked A.  is  attached,  in which it is estimated that  on 31st July,  1918,  there will be  a deficit of 282,200 men  of  all arms,.    The  rate of casualties on which this estimate Is  based is worked on  a basij ox 3 months1  light and 9 months1  heavy fighting during the year,   It is pointed out that this  basis of possible casualties  has never yet In practice proved  to be  excessive.      Although the  actual deficiency today in France  is shown as 49,000 of all arms, this figure  does not in any way represent the actual deficiency in the Army.    Tens of thousands of men who are  not  actually returned as casualties are in fact incapable of taking their place  in the ranks,  and this wastage,  apari from the actual wastage,  will increase  so long as heavy fightingproceeds.    It  is  impossible to  gauge  either the  strength or efficiency of an Army by figures.      The  number of men who have  been wounded or sick,  and who may become fit  from April to July have  been included in the figure  121,000,  and it is pointed  out  that  the  estimate made  by the Army Council during  the  Cabinet  discussion  on  Jian-Power lastWinter,  an estimate  which was considerably  below  that  put  forwardby the  Minister of National  Service,  has not  in fact been reached.   The  numbers of men becoming  fit  week by week are considerably  below the &quot;ar Office estimate,  tut that estimatehas been adhered to  in regard to the nest 4  months.     Another  point  to  bear in mind with regard  to  men  becomingfit again  for the  trenehos is that  during the prosent  fighting, in which heavy  casualties  have been  suffered, a very largoproportion of the  casualties will be men, wounded  and unbounded,who have  fallen into  the  enemy18 hands.      If  the Army in  the Field is to  recover  its fighting value 882,200  men fit  for  general service  and  over 19 years  of agemust be  produced at  once.     The Minister  of National Service estimates that by inoreas- ing the  military age to 50, there will be 750,000  Category A,-men produced, of whom 110,000 will be fit for military  servie^ -(G.T.1W-
 (Q.T. 174.)  -  while Ireland is estimated by him under the sains conditions  to produce 200,000 men.  It the same tint it must V clearly understood that men beyond a certain age are of no use&apos; for Infant 17,  or   or units of other arms where great physical endurance is  required under unfavourable conditions, &quot;The oldermen can usefully  be used as substitutes, and in the Army this oas bo done to tho number of 60,000 unskilled men, ovsr a perio of 5 to 8 months.   Beyond this, substitution would be of no avail ill; tho  Army, owing to the drastic combing which has been is fores for  a long time past .      The position in regard to Irish units is aa  follows:-0p to December 1917,  there were 43 Battalions of Irish Regiment in tho Field,  of  which 35 were newly raised.   To raise andmaintain these units  during eS/Sths years required35 units raised...............     35,00043 units maintained up to December 1917.......   141,900                                                  176,900    number raised of  all  Categories  inIreland up to December 1917 **  123,585,of whioh approximately 50$&apos;were  Category A *     jSl^j^Sleaving to ha provided by recruits         from England.......116,105                                                  .53B3CB 1 11 IIMI II      There axe at present only  32 Irish battalions  (exclusiveof ths Irish Guards]  for  whioh there  exist 36  Reserve Battalionin this country to provide drafts.  The  number of A  men  in the 6 Rasorva Battalions is   -                  A i1 ........... *... 291                  A lv M.............. 763                       Total TM4I*itl)i      The result is that  including men  sick  and wounded whobecome fit, the only available  reinforoamsate   or  tho 32Battalions will be 470 a  month, whereas 35,000 are required toJse^p the Battalions at strength for  the next 12 months.      If and when the requisite numbers are  raised in Ireland115.000 will ba required &quot;to replace  Enfeliabma 5., already draftedto Irish units.      The Army Council, while fully  reoognising the difficultywhich confront tha Government in regard to the present crisis,ragpaotfully draw attention to their insistent requests,$standing over tha last two years, that men  should be providedin numbers cor.jsia.erad nacessary by th*a military advisers of theGovernment.  Had it been  found possible to provide these numberoven after the reduction  of the Divisions from 12  battalionsto 9y taa ^tuation to-day would, as  represented on theI&amp;tajoa Shaet presented to the 77ar Cabinet during  the disoussioion Men-Iowa^ last Deoambey, have been that instead of beingfaced with an over-increasing deficit amounting in July to atXaast 88^,200 man, tho re would now have been in hand in Reserveunits 88f,000 man to maintain the Army at strength.      The whola of the available drafts of all arms will havefc$an despatched to France during the coming weak and after thatthe HUBihera will be negligible.
                          - 3 -     The Home  Service Divisions  have  been  drained  of  aJJ^fch^ir1fit men, and the  Graduated  Battalions and  Reserve  units  of allmen over 186/12 years.   The Cyclist Mvlsion,  which forms theonly physioally fit  unit in the  United Kingdom,  is beingdepleted of 5,000 A. men against the  representations  of  theField Marshal  Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces.     Therefore the  situation  in  the United Kingdom at thepresent moment is that  until  steps are taken  to  raise the menconsidered necessary by the Army Council as shown  by  them onfthe attached balance Sheet, the  Council will   Ve xaasble  toreplace losses either in France  or other Theatres, either nowor in the future.29th March, 1918.
