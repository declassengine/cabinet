SUPPLIES AND PRICES.    Allied Requirements. In  reply to a cablegram  informing him as to additionalrestrictions  which are being  imposed by  the United States Food Administration inorder to increase  the  export  of  wheat  to the  Allies,  Lord Rhondda has  sent thefollowing cablegram to Mr. Hoover :            &quot; The  willingness  of  the American  people voluntarily  to reduce  their      consumption of wheat products and the new measures you are taking to meet      ; the emergency and provide the Allies with bread are deeply appreciated.  Such      self-sacrifice and whole-hearted effort inspire us with renewed determination.&quot;    Lord Reading cables that in order  to meet  the  great  internal difficulties in theUnited  States in  connection  with the  distribution  of wheat supplies  Mr. Hooversuggests that  American wheat should be shipped from the Pacific coast to the Allies,that Canadian wheat  supplies should be  consolidated with American and  sent  toMinneapolis and Lake ports, and that for every two  bushels of wheat exported to theAllies and Belgium, Holland and Switzerland after April 1st, the United States shoulddraw from  Canada  one bushel at such times and  places as needed.  The WheatExecutive have  asked  Lord Rhondda to  reply urging that Canadian supplies shouldnot be drawn on and  suggesting that Australian wheat should be transferred to thePacific coast of  the  United States or, in  emergency,  that a limited supply should  bedrawn from the  Argentine,     Bacon, Hams, and Lard.- Large amounts  of  bacon are coming forward andarrangements have been made for  putting some  into cold storage instead of allowingimmediate distribution.  Investigations have been made to show  the  exact amountsrequired for consumption under present and future rationing  schemes, and it appearsthat, if the whole of the recent American offer is received, there will be at the end ofAugust, 1918, a reserve of 103,000 tons in cold store.  If the whole of this offer isnot received and the amounts  of the Ministry of  Food&apos;s indent only are imported, thereserve in cold store at that date will be only 10,000  tons.     Wholesale co-operative societies have drawn attention to the shortage  of home- produced supplies, and  requested that the position should be remedied by immediate allotments from imported stocks.   Further information is being furnished, and special allotments will  be made when necessary.     The proposed uniform price for bacon without bone has, been opposed by the whole  trade and  a meeting  of the  Consumers&apos; Council on  the  28th March,   1918, passed a resolution  that the proposal to establish a  flat price to the consumer should be abandoned.  The amendment of the  Bacon,  Ham, and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917  will, therefore, endeavour  only to reduce the number of cute and  the corresponding number of prices.      The raising of the maximum price of  pigs  necessitates the revision of the prices fixed for home-produced bacon, ham, and lard.   Investigations have been made, and the new figures are almost complete.  Differences are being adjusted with the Ayrshire curers, and deputations from  the North  and  South  of Ireland are  to  be  received on the 11th April,  1918.
     Butter.-A further purchase of 1,190 tons of butter has been made in the UnitedStates of  America at prices  varying from 401 cents, to 47 cents per lb. ; 4,785 toilshave arrived  during the fortnight ending March  30th, 1918, from Australia, 3,026tons from New Zealand, 30 tons from Canada, and 635 tons from the United States ofAmerica.   The quantity on the water on March 30th was 18,500 tons.     A distribution of  25 per cent, of the amount of butter applied for during Aprilhas been made this week to caterers, institutions and retailers.     Cheese. 2,954 tons  of New Zealand cheese has arrived in this country ; advicehas been received that the total shipments of Australian cheese up to March 28th, 1918,is 1,938 tons, the unshipped stock being 1,052 tons.  The estimated surplus availablefor export from Australia is 400 tons in April, 300 tons in May, and 300 tons in June.Advice has been received of  the shipment of 18 tons of  cheese  from Canada and3.12  tons  from the United  States  of America,  where contracts  have been placedamounting to 4,759 tons.     Dried Fruits. A  distribution  of 5,000 tons of dates  is  being made this week,and  the retail price has been  fixed by Order at Qd. per lb.   The distribution is basedon the general lines of the 1915-16 distribution, but additional supplies have beenallocated to areas where there has been an increase of population.     The &quot; Adamantos Lemos &quot;  has  left Patras with about 3,000 tons of  currants onboard.  There still remain 1,500 tons to be lifted from Patras,  and it is probable  thatthe Greek Government will charter a small steamer for this purpose..     The S.S. &quot; Cadagua.&quot; with 1,400  tons of Malaga raisins, has arrived at Bristol.     Fresh Fruit and Jam.-The total delivery of Bitter Oranges to date is 190,548*half-chests of Spanish, and 2,074 tons of Sicilian.     Half a ton of jam has been  sent  to Dunfermline as  an emergency consignment.The  total  quantity of jam  held by manufacturers  and important wholesalers on -March 16, is 12,000 tons  - three weeks&apos; supply for  the  civilian population, at ^ lb.per head per week.   The manufacturers estimate  that they can produce 54,000 tons(13^ weeks&apos; supply) by the end of May/     Meat. The supply of live stock coming forward to the markets continues to  fallshort of anticipations, although this is in a large measure due to  the  lighter weightof the animals.   The result is that heavier demands are being thrown on frozen meat,and it has become necessary to  furnish  supplies even to those parts of  the countrywhich were expected to  prove  self-supporting.   With the approach of  the date atwhich the National Rationing Scheme  will come into operation  over the whole country,steps have been taken to ensure that adequate supplies of frozen meat are depositedin all the  principal distributing centres, in order that  everything shall be done tosecure the issue of  the full ration allowance.   In this direction great  assistance  hasbeen afforded by the arrival  of  substantial cargoes  from North America, and so faras estimates can be made, at the present time, there would appear to be good groundsfor anticipating that the full ration allowance of meat of one kind or another  willbe forthcoming during these  months  in which the home supply will be at its lowestebb..                                                       .:           .        .     The situation with regard to Irish cattle has reached an acute phase and  measuresare about to  betaken  to control the value of live stock  in  that country, in order to.bring them in proper relation with meat prices in England.     Milk. The Committee   on  the  Production  and Distribution of Milk met on21st  March under the chairmanship of Major Astor, and passed certain  resolutionswith regard to the provision  of soiling crops for dairy  cattle, recommended by  theAgricultural Sub-Committee ; these  resolutions have been forwarded to the  Board ofAgriculture.  The special sub-committee appointed  to consider the immediate stepsnecessary for  the control  of the  collection, utilisation, and  distribution of milk soldwholesale, the establishment  of  new depots and their geographical position, has  metfive times under the chairmanship of the Director of Milk Supplies, and is proceedingas rapidly as possible with its deliberations.     Oils and  Fats. A serious  position has arisen in respect of  margarine manu-factured in Holland  from crude and refined oils exported  from this country.  Thetotal deficiency of the two chief firms concerned in respect of margarine due to bedelivered  in  this country from 1st December 1917 to the  end of February 1918 is9,113 tons.  This being the case it is now proposed that  the export of raw materialsto.these firms be stopped.  &quot;.            ,:                                     -  &quot;                                                                         A 2
     Oil Seeds. The imports of oleo and  premier jus for margarine manufacturecontinue on  a good  scale, but as prices  are  steadily rising in the United States ofAmerica it  will probably  be necessary to  come to an arrangement as to maximumprices.  This can probably be arranged  without  difficulty as the United States ofAmerica get the benefit of  our  maximum  prices  on the West Coast of Africa andsupplies from our other colonies are given on favourable terms.     30,000 tons of linseed have been purchased, but the resultant  oil from this  seedwill cost considerably over maximum prices  ; if  possible it is desirable to  arrange tobuy conjointly with the United States of America in order to avoid  competition.     Potatoes. -The  following arrangements have been  made with reference  to thedisposal of the present potato crop :      (1) On May 15th, 1918, the Ministry  of Food  will  purchase  all sound  ware           potatoes in the United Kingdom  for  which the grower cannot  otherwise           find a market.  The price  for such  potatoes will not be less than 7/. per           ton for 4 ton lots  f.o.r.     (2) The base price for potatoes will remain unaltered until further notice, but on           and after  April 15th compensation  claims will be based on the minimum           price of .61. 10s. per ton, and on and after  May 15th compensation  claims           will be based on the minimum price of 11.  per  ton.     (3) On and after April 1st, 1918,  every farmer who  redresses  his clamps for the           purpose of extracting the seed for planting, or for sale for planting, and           reclamps the ware, will receive from the Ministry of Food an additional           10s. per ton for each  ton  of sound ware potatoes subsequently sold  from           the new clamps.     Rabbits and Game. At Grosvenor House  on 27 March a representative gatheringof owners of shooting rights  and tenants of shootings  met the Rabbits  and GameAdvisory Committee to discuss a scheme for obtaining as  large a supply as possiblerof rabbits, game, and wild fowl during the ensuing season.  A resolution was carriedunanimously declaring that the owners and tenants  of shootings welcomed the oppor-tunity of adding to the food supply, and  offering their  assistance.  The Committeewill submit to Lord Rhondda working details of the scheme proposed.     Sugar. In the House of Lords, on March  21st,  Lord Rhondda announced that itshould be possible to  allocate this year about 10,000 tons of sugar to private fruit-growers for making jam.  The allocation of the sugar will be made by the Local PoodControl Committees in co-operation with the War Agricultural Executive Committees.Permits will be issued by the Food Control Committees and the issue of sugar will beat a rate of not more than 10 lb. per head for each member of the household.  Largerallocations may be made where the Committee  considers it desirable,  but the  jammade from the extra sugar must be placed at the disposal of the Committee at currentprices for sale on the market for consumption by the general public.  Applicants forsugar will be required to give an undertaking that the sugar will not be used forother purposes.  They wall be credited with If lb. of  jam  for every pound of sugarsupplied, and will be expected to  reduce their purchases of jam to this extent.     Tea.-Lord Rhondda received  a  deputation of importers of  China tea, and thearrangements for  the purchase  of China tea on behalf  of  the  Government  werediscussed.     At a meeting with  representatives  of the Multiple  Shop  Companies it  wasgenerally agreed that surplus supplies of tea should be sent to rationed areas inloose form.     At a meeting of  the Tea Advisory Committee it was  agreed  that  the  system of distribution  on the  basis  of supplies in the datum period was no longer a suitable system, and that some form of registration should be substituted for it.     The rebate allowed for van delivery has been reconsidered, and on the 15th April, 1918, the rebate allowed for out-of-pocket expenses  will be reduced from a maximum of lfd. a pound to a maximum of Id. a pound.  The trade has also been advised that the rebate may be further reduced or abolished.                             ORGANISED DISTRIBUTION.      Food Queues-Tlie estimated number of persons  attending  food queues in the Metropolitan Police  area still continues  to show a  satisfactory decline, except that
there was a rise just before the Easter holidays.  The figures below relate to the weekpreceding the introduction of rationing, as compared with the last two weeks :-*Dates.	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	Thursday.	Friday.	Saturday.18th to 23rd February 18th to 23rd March - - -25 th to 30th March -	46,316 80 610	143,933 788 490	131,809 1 157,223 1,210 1,980 2,230 7,960		317,158 3,790	542,953 6,619 24,340    In this area the demand for unrationed food, such as cheese, is responsible for acertain proportion of these queues.                                             .    In the unrationed areas queues are rather on the increase, notably in the Northernand Western districts of England.   There is a strong expression of opinion in somequarters-that it would be advisable to include tea among the rationed articles.    Local Administration. The great  increase of work  devolving upon the FoodCommissioners in connection with the Food Rationing Schemes is likely to necessitatea general increase in the staff  employed.  The burden on  Food Control Committeeshas also been great, involving in some cases the resignation of Executive Officers whoare unable or unwilling to cope with the press of work.    In the majority of the  large towns in the industrial districts increased LabourRepresentation on  Committees has  now been provided for.  Forty-two authorities toincrease  the membership of  Committees have been  issued since 19th March, and26 applications are now under consideration.    The applications  made seem  to point to  a growing willingness on  the part ofLocal Authorities to appoint additional Labour Representatives, though in some casesthere  is a reluctance to adopt the policy of the Ministry.    Rationing. The following figures show the extent to which rationing of essentialfoodstuffs has  become general throughout Great Britain.   Taking the sugar-buyingpopulation as the best available figure of the  normal population, namely 39,000,000,there  are:          35,844,000 persons rationed for butter and margarine.         17,629,000            ,,     ,,  tea.         15,337,000    ,,       ,,     ,,  meat.          1,976,891                  ,,  cheese.          1,421,186    ,,       ,,     ,,  lard.            228,542    ,,       ,,     ,,  other foodstuffs such as jam, syrup, &amp;c.    On and from Sunday next, April 7th, the entire population will be rationed formeat.  Thereafter  no person in any part of the country may purchase meat  from aretailer or take a meat meal at an  eating  place except on  the  production of a meatcard from which the appropriate coupons  must  be detached by the seller.  Cateringestablishments and institutions will purchase by official order  forms and  not  bycards.    The rationing  scheme covers  meat in every form, including  beef, mutton, pork,edible offal,  suet, bones, bacon and ham, poultry, game, venison, and cooked,  canned,preserved, and miscellaneous meats of all kinds.    After April 7th persons moving from one part of the country to another shouldin all cases take their meat cards with  them.  Supplementary rations for physicalworkers  will  begin on April  14th,  and  supplementary ration  cards are now beingissued to persons who have applied and are entitled to them.    After April 14th the card of any child who was over 6 vears of age on March 1st,1918, may be  exchanged for an ordinary card, entitling to full rations.    As  from  May 5th, supplementary  rations  will be  allowed  to  boys who  onMarch 1st, 1918, were over 13 and under 18 3*ears of age.   The supplementary rationswill be 5 ozs.  of bacon or bone with its equivalent in other meat (excluding butchers&apos;meat).     As from May 5th, bacon (including ham) will be purchasable only  from a retailerwith  whom  the card of the purchaser (whether ordinary or supplementary) has beenregistered for bacon.   Persons living in  registered establishments are excepted fromthis rule.   :
G    As from May 5th, two coupons only of each meat  card will  be  available forbutcher&apos;s meat (including pork).  Any or all of the coupons will, as  before, be avail-able for the purchase  of  bacon or other meats.  Increased supplies of bacon will beprovided ;to meet the third coupon which will no longer be available for butcher&apos;s meat,    Self-Suppliers and Direct Supplies. The consumption of rationed food  by self-suppliers will be regulated in  three  distinct ways according to the  food concerned.Rabbits or hares, whether tame or wild, may be consumed by any member of the self-suppliers&apos; household, in addition to the ration allowed. Consumption of cattle, sheep,and pigs will be controlled by reports of slaughter.  As regards cattle and sheep, themeat consumed must be  accounted for by coupons at the rate of three coupons per  lb.As regards pigs, where the pig is  not  the first pig killed, the meat consumed  mustbe accounted for by coupons  at  the rate of two  coupons per lb.  In the case of thefirst pig,  the meat may be consumed  ration  free.   Poultry,  game-birds,^ wild-fowl,venison, and  butter will,  after July 13, be controlled by registration  of  self-supplying-households.  Till then, the head of  the  household will  be responsible for keepingrecords of food so consumed,  and for marking butter cards  and detaching couponsto account for food consumed.   Game-birds, wild-fowl, and butter, may be consumedby self-suppliers at special rates in excess of the ordinary rations.    Self-suppliers may  consume their  produce  on self-suppliers&apos; terms even  whenaway from the place at which the food is produced.    The obtaining of direct  supplies  will,  after July 13, be controlled  by DirectSivpply Permits.  Till then, the head of the  household  obtaining such supplies willbe responsible for marking butter cards and  detaching coupons to  account  for thesupplies, and must also  furnish&apos;the supplier  with a written statement to the  effectthat he has done so.    Supplementary Eations. In view of the fact that during the  next few weeks thesupply of cured bacon will exceed the amount required for the ordinary rations, it isintended to dispose of the  surplus  by giving a supplementary  ration equal to twoextra coupons  per week  to heavy workers, and a supplementary ration of half thatamount to  boys between  the ages of 13 and 18.    For the  purpose of  allotting this supplementary ration  the  population is beingclassified on the following lines :                       A. Children.                      B. Normal adults.                      C. Adolescents.                      D. Heavy industrial workers.                      E. Heavy agricultural workers.                      F.  Very heavy workers.    All men in classes F., E. and  D. are eligible for the supplementary ration, andall women doing work  which corresponds to that of men in classes  F. and E. areclassed as D.,  and are  also eligible.  It is at  present proposed to give  an equalsupplementary ration to  all three classes D., E. and  F., with the  reservation that if itshould become necessary later to ration the  population more  closely class F. will begiven  first consideration, then E., then D.     All adolescent boys are eligible for the  supplementary ration provided  they arenot already receiving it on the ground of heavy bodily work.                             ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     The number of prosecutions instituted during the two weeks ending March  23rd,in England, Scotland,  and Wales is 1,223, and in Ireland 903.  Of these, in England,Scotland and Wales 1,088 were successful, and in Ireland 826.    The average  fine for England, Scotland and  Wales during the  week  endingMarch 23rd was hi. 15s.  6d., and for Ireland 9s. lid.    There have been  1-1 cases (four defendants) during the past fortnight  in whichimprisonment without option of a fine has been inflicted.     There were              201 prosecutions in connection with bacon, ham, and lard.             209     ,,         .          .       tea.                     ,             319     ,,       ,,      ,,       ,,   meat.                         :
  : Adequate penalties are being imposed for infringements of the Milk (Amendment)Order, 1917.  At Harberth Petty Sessions two farmers were fined 100Z. for selling milkwith 41 per cent, of water added, and at West Ham for the same offence a  milk purveyorwas sentenced to 4 months&apos; imprisonment.  At Bristol, on March 26th, Messrs. Purnell&amp; Panter,  malt  vinegar  brewers, were  fined 3201.  and 25 guineas  costs under theBarley Restriction Order.   Their managing director was also fined the same  amountand costs.PART II.-SUMMARY  OF  FOOD POSITION.                   IMPORTS..    The following table shows the aggregate weight of principal foods imported inthe first 13 weeks of this year.   The total  is 785,000 tons less than in the first threemonths of 1917, a difference almost entirely duelo the diminution of cereal imports.Week ending	Aggregate.	Cereals (including Rice).

Meat and bacon were  again  at  a high level and sugar considerably above theaverage (Table A).    The figures given above for cereals need  modification before use in conjunctionwith other  statements relating to wheat, since the  increased tendency to  importflour in place of grain makes it necessary to state the  former in terms of equivalentgrain.   To express imports in grain  we should add  15,000 tons, 11,200 tons, and3,800 tons in the weeks ended March 16th, 23rd, and 30th respectively ;  101,300 tonsto the aggregate of cereals  for the first 13 weeks of  1918, and 36,400  tons for thecorresponding weeks of 1917.  The decrease in importation of cereals in three monthsis then 703,000 tons instead of 768,000 tons as shown in the table above.                                 CONSUMPTION.    Meat. The  supply of  home-fed meat at the Central Market, London,  and  atManchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool markets fell 8 per  cent,  from the  week endedMarch 9th to that ended March 16th, and rose 4^ per cent, in the subsequent week.   Atthe Central  Market it fell again 11 per cent, in the week ended  March 30th (Table B).    The supply  of foreign meat, which had risen since the beginning  of Februarytill it reached  3,596 tons in the week ended March 16th (a  quantity  17 per  cent.    *  Since no report was issued last week two Tables A. are given showing imports last week and  theweek before.
higher than in the corresponding week in 1917) fell to 1,717 tons in the week endedMarch 23rd;  the  fall appears to  be only temporary, for at the Central  Market thesupply in the week  ended March 30th  was only 16 per cent,  less than a fortnightearlier.    At 59 markets (Table C) the  supply of fat  cattle fell 14 per cent, from the weekended March 13th  to that  ended March 20th and a further  20 per cent, in thefollowing week.   The supply of fat sheep also fell 10 per cent, and  24 per cent, inthe two weeks.    These markets are no longer representative, and a different view is shown in thefollowing table : 	Week ended March 16th.	Week ended March 23rd.

The following table shows the change in sales over a longer period : -Sales as percentages of amounts in the four weeks February llthto March 16t7i, 1918.Four weeks ended	Butter and Margarine together.

In  spite of theincrease in the sales  of bacon, the  aggregate of bacon, hams, and  lard is only two-fifths of that a year ago.
