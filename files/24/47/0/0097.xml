a, \5*.6/Gsn.^o^/6616..            WAR OABim?.                Shipment of remountg from America,           Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State  for War,(This Docume&apos;His Britannic IV1aiestv&apos;s COVRNMO^           FTColonel JODIBZ 7           It has become necessary to resume the shipment  ofhorses and mules from America at tho rate of 8,000 monthly,commencing in May.           wlien shipment was suspended at the end of Februaryit vas estimated that 50,000 animals would be available fromstocks held in the Remount Depots and by absorption ofreductions contemplated in the Army in Prance..   These 50,000animals were calculated to meet requirements for March, April,May, J*une and July, at 10,000 per month to supply the UnitedKingdom, Prance and the Mediterranean theatres.           Owing to recent events in Prance, it is nowimpossible to count upon the full reductions contemplated, andinstead of 50,000 animals only 30,000 will be available forissue, while the wastage in horses during the recent operationshas evidently bo en above the normal, though exact figures  arenot yet obtainable.           Since the declaration of war, the Army has boughtroundly 25$ of the existing number of horses of all types  ever5 years eld in the United Kingdom j  Army purchases, lack ofpetrol and increased cultivation have caused an extremescaroity of animals in the United Kingdom at the present time,and prices of all kinds *f draught horses have rioen by 10Q$.It is, therefore, impossible to make further drafts of any size  Iupon the United Kingdom without seriously hampering essontial   1trades and Pood Production.           I therefore ask the War Cabinet to sanotion the      Ire-allotment of tonnage for 0,000 horses a month from America.   1           I should point out that np special horse ships  are   Ineeded, animals being a^pimmedated on the decko of munitionand grain ships,  &apos; froslitfrlcfc it is understood the fittingshave been removed only i&amp;fcre they interfered with the stowageof cargo, and in these caseB they are held ready for re-erectionjDERBY.10th April!, 1918.
