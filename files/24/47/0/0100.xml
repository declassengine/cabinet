ffHlS  DOCUMENT  IS  TE5 PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITJMIC MAJESTY15  gOVgRgmT)Ej3 RET.    4198.                TOBACCO  STOCKS.                  (Reference  War Cabinet  367.  Minute  6).                        ffote  by Lord Curzon.     On April 9tk I was authorised by the War Cabinet on theirbehalf to settle the question of the present position oftobacoo stocks in this country  (G.T. 3989).     On April 10th I called a meeting of the representativesof the Departments concerned in order that the matter mightbe fully discussed.     Two alternatives presented themselves ;-  (A)   TO maintain the importation of Tobacco at the        present level of 6&quot;,000 tons a month.  (B)   TO reduce the civilian consumption and apply        a eim.il.ar restriction to His Majesty:s Forces        at home.     In support of alternative  (A) I received a letterfrom the Chancellor cf the liiohsquer in which he laid stresson the importance, from the Revenue point of view, ofmaintaining the importation  if tonnage can possibly befound, and pointed out that every ton of tobacco importedmeans  700 to tho Revenue on the existing basis.   Ee furthermentioned that he was considering the possibility of pacingan enhanced duty on tobacoo, following upon an increase inthe price of the manufactured article.     The Shipping Controller said that, while the importationof the tobacco would involve the shutting out of a correspond-ing amount of some other commodity, the amount of tonnageinvolved was not very great and in view of the advantagesmentioned in regard to Revenue he. was ready to maintain thetonnage on the present basis, if given instructions to thiseffect.   If he experiences any difficult.ty in carrying outthese instructions^at a later data he will bring the matterto my notioe.     In these circumstances I decided that the importationof tobacco on the present level of 6,000 tons a monthshould be maintained.(Signed)   0UEZ02? of KEDLESTON.  Whitehall Gardens, S.V?,       10th April. 1918.
