The ex-Danish s/s &quot;EXCELLENCE PLESKE&quot; was sunk by-torpedo on the 31st March?STORAGE OF EXPLOSIVES AT THE PRINCIPAL PORTS,          An invitation was sent out from this Ministry to theprincipal ports dealing with explosives in order that It mightbe ascertained directly from the Port Authorities what theirfeelings were as regards the handling and storage of thisclass of cargo in their respective ports *  Representativesfrom the following ports accepted the invitation; London,Liverpool, Glasgow, Leith, Swansea,  Avonmouth and Newport, andat a Conference at which the Admiralty, War Office,  wererepresented, it appeared that Liverpool and London were mostaffected.  So far as London is concerned high explosives aredealt with in the River, and not in the Docks except inemergencies, and in order to avoid the concentration of too                                                      large
large a quantity of high explosives in one place, and toreduce the risk of a serious explosion enquiries are &quot;beingactively pursued with a view of arranging to use an additionalwharf with rail access to it, at which explosives can be dealtwith.  It is also proposed to limit the quantity- dealt withat any one tine.          In Liverpool the case is different, as at this portexplosives arrive from the United States and must be dealtwith in docko  At this Port a Danger Officer has been appointedwhose sole duty it is to advise and watch the handling ofexplosive cargo.  In order to provide for the best possibleprotection against any undue risks an endeavour will be made toconcentrate the discharge of explosives as far as possible inthe most isolated dock.  This result, however, will not alwaysbe obtainable, as owing to vessels arriving in convoys toogreat a delay would be caused by waiting in all cases for thisdock, but the vessel or vessels carrying the largest cargo ofthis nature will be discharged in the particular dock indicated.          A proposal to limit the quantity carried in any one.steamer to 500 tons is also under investigation.          At Leith a large number of mines are stored in oneof the dock sheds by the Admiralty, and that Department is beingpressed to remove and store them elsewhere.          The representatives of the other ports who attendedthe Conference had little or no complaints or suggestions tomake.          A reassuring statement was made by both the representa-tives of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions andconfirmed by Major Cooper-Key of the Home Office to the effectthat the danger of an explosion occurring from propellants wasvery slight, and the risks run from this class of ammunition wereprincipally from fire.  Under normal conditions there was nodanger from an explosion, but it was impossible to forecast whatwould result if a bomb came into contact with propellants.  It                                                        was
 was not probable, however, that a fire on board, a vessel partially loaded with propellants would cause an explosion, as from tests made recently with cordite etc. the result had been to generate intense heat without causing an explosion. COAL TO FRANCE AND ITAtY.           The present position in regard to supplies is that&apos; France is unable to supply to Italy the agreed monthly quantity of 550,000 tons in the month 15th March to 15th April owing to military movements on the railways in the South of France.  It has been necessary therefore to divert to Italy 100,000 tons of coal actually en route to the Mediterranean, in order to make secure Italy&apos;s coal position.           This involves taking colliers bound for the Fleet and Admiralty Dockyards, for the Egyptian Railways and for Gibraltar for bunker stocks, and is an emergency measure (forced on us on account of Italy1s critical position) the effect cf which may be serious for each of the  services mentioned.           The withdrawals from these services are being made good (as soon as ppssible) by diverting liners, which would otherwise have gone to America- in ballast, to take cargoes of coal to Gibraltar etc.RUSSIAN POSITION           The Officers and Ken of Russian and Finnish steamers, which have been requisitioned by the British Government, are not being sent back to Russia against their will, but are being allowed to work in this country under the Timber Supply Department or to go to America in search of employment, if they so desire. STORES FOR BRITISH ARMY IN-JFRAHCE.           The quantity of military stores discharged in France during the ?/eek ended 30th March was 187,504 tons* EXCHANGE OF BRITISH AND GERMAN PRISONERS OF v;rAR.           The vessels on this service arrived at Boston on the -
                                                      -     17051st March on their 9th trip.  They brought over no Britishprisoners but embarked at Boston the following Germanprisoners, viz:-   550 military and 30 civilians^MEDITERRANEAN LINE OF COMMUNICATION.          Owing to the congestion of Railways in France,  itwill be necessary to discontinue the use of the Cherbourg/Taranto route, as soon as the  stores now en route have beendisposed of.   Arrangements have therefore been made for theconveyance of stores by the long sea route.LOSSES AND GAINS OF BRITISH TONNAGE          The losses of British steamers of 500 gross tonsand upwards during the week ended the 30th ultimo were asfollows:-Lost by&apos;war risk    8 ships of 21,255 gross tons :&apos;    !l   marine &quot;    2   &quot;   &quot;   4,676    &quot;    &quot;Making a total of  10 ships of 25,931 gross tons.The gains were as follows:-New vessels (British built) brought into service                 17 ships of 78,571 gross tonsTransferred from Foreign Flags   26   &quot;   n  48,548   &quot;     &quot;Making a total of 45  &quot;   11 127,119   &quot;     t(or a net gain of 101,188 tons.REPRESENTATION OF MINISTRY OF SNIFFING IN NORTH AMERICA.
