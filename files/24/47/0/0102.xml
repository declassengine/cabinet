Note by Lord R. Cecil.

Mr. Balfour.

At the last meeting of the Russia Committee General Poole pressed upon us the importance of action at Murmansk. The Committee agreed with him and requested him to put his views on paper. He has now sent us the annexed Memorandum and with your permission I propose to circulate it to the War Cabinet.

Memorandum by General Poole.

Owing to the reports of the probable seizure? of Kem on the Murman Railway by the Finnish White Guards, I consider that immediate action is necessary to ensure that the Port of Murmansk is held by the British.

Owing to the fact that the White Guards were forced to obtain munitions, rifles, etc., from the Germans, the latter have a great and possibly now overpowering influence over the Finnish White Guards and consequently they, the Germans, will try and arrange for occupation of Murmansk ostensibly by the White Guards in order to drive out British influence.

The Finns undoubtedly are striving to obtain an open part in the North and in view of the disorder, etc. in Russia, the occupation of Murmansk affords an excellent opportunity for meeting their aims. I do not believe that the Finns, without German influence, are anti-British.

It is essential for Great Britain to maintain a definite foothold in Russia and I suggest that the Admiralty should arrange to occupy with a small landing force the Part of Murmansk and patrol the Railway down to Kola. If the White Guard should push up North from Kem the Kola bridge could be destroyed and the Railway damaged. It is doubtful if the Finns would attack British forces but if they did it is always possible to retire to the Port and hold same under the protection of the guns of the ships in the Port.

At the present time I understand that there are at


 Murmansk  two British  and one French cruisers.   I  strongly adriie that one,  or better two,  additional British cruisers of the Apollo&quot;class  should he  sent  as  reinforcement and to demonstrate Britich authority there.   I suggest that it will be necessary to arrange fer a  landing party of  say 500 in  all from the ships in the port-        In  order to  give  the S. I. 0. on the spot at Murmansk ample  time to make his  arrangements,  general instructions should, I  suggest,  be sent at once - all details must be  left to the man on the spot.  I  consider that it might be possible to obtain* Trotski&apos;8 whole-hearted  support of the scheme on the grounds that the result of such action would be to preserve the Port intact for Russia against any  outside force.        A definite policy  must be broadly published giving the reasonsJor British action.        Great Britain will hold the Port of Murmansk to safeguard her Bea route to Arohangel against Germany and definitely guarantees not to  hold  same after the conclusion  of the present t?ar, and  hand same back  to Russia so long as law  and order is re- stored there.        During the occupation British will be responsible for law and order.        In  the event of the British Naval forces having to evacuate from Murmansk, $resumably the Port would at once  be used as a submarine base bp  the Germans and the danger from submarine attack for British ships  en  route to Archangel for export of raw material urgently  required  would  be vastly increased.        I beg to suggest  that an adequate staff should be sent out at once to the S.     0.  Murmansk to deal with the above operation! if the scheme is approved.                                  (Signed) P. C. POOLE,                                                   Major-General.5th April.  1913.
