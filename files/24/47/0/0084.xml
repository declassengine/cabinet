rju^uki^iot the duties upon foreign goods im-polrtM into England from  Ireland  obviate  thisdanger ?  5. Are you afraid that Ulster industries mightbe  unfairly taxed,  by income  tax or otherwise,in order  to provide bounties for southern indus-tries ?  Would  you  be  satisfied  by  a limitation ofpermissible expenditure on  bounties  or  a limi-tation of industries on which  bounties  can begiven, or of both?  6. Do   you  iear  that  an  Irish  Governmentrepresenting agricultural  interests  would  notadequately appreciate industrial and commercialproblems ?  If so,  how far would  your fears be met byParliamentary  safeguards in the form of  a  Pro-vincial veto on legislation or a strong non-electedUpper House,  or  special representation  in theLower House?  Questions for Nationalist Representatives.  1. Are you afraid that unless Ireland has fiscalautonomy the Irish Government will not be ableto  adjust  its   controllable  tax-revenue  to itsexpenditure ?  Would it satisfv vou  if  Ireland  had  control(a) over  direct taxation  only  or (b) over  bothdirect and indirect taxation subject to the  iimi-tation as to, free  trade with  England,  or (c)over Excise but not  Customs,  or  (d) over therates of Customs duties  but not over the selec-tion of  the articles subjected  to them?  2. Are  you  afraid  that  if  under  a  fiscalunion,  England became protectionist,  some  ofthe duties imposed might  injure Irish interests (eg.,  a  duty on steel)?   Would  you  be  satisfied  if  fiscal  union  only went  so  far as to secure mutual free trade?    3. Are  you  afraid  that  if,  under complete fiscal  union, England became protectionist andbecame  involved  in tariff wars with  foreigncountries, Irish industries might suffer?  Would the same remedy meet this fear  (Ire-land being able to  make her own terms  withforeign  countries) ?  4. Are you afraid that  under fiscal union Ire-land would  be unable to encourage new indus-tries or  protect industries  from &quot; dumping &quot;?  Would  this  fear be  met by power  to  grantbounties and to impose special duties  on  goodsproved  to  be  &quot;dumped&quot;?    Possible  Arrangements for Compromise.  1. Ireland to have control  over  direct taxes.England to  impose  indirect  taxes,  and retaintheir proceeds.  2. Ditto,  but Ireland to receive  the  proceeds.  3. Ditto,  but Ireland  to  receive  a specifiedpart of the proceeds.  4. Any of the above,  plus the power to Ire-land to giant bounties.  5. Any of the above,  plus the power to Ire-land to protect industries against dumping.  6. Ireland to have control over Excise, notover  Customs.  7. Ireland to have the right to vary the  ratesof  the Customs duties,  but  not  to  select thearticles  subjected to them.  8. Ireland to have control over Excise  andCustoms subject to free  trade between Englandand Ireland  except to  excisable articles.  9. Any of the  above arrangements  combinedwith Parliamentary  safeguards to ensure thatminorities may have an  adequate  force in  fiscalpolicy, e.gm, a provincial veto,  strong un-electedUpper House,  special representation  in LowerHouse.SCHEDULE V.ANSWERS  TO  THE  QUESTIONS  ADDRESSED  TO  NATIONALIST                             REPRESENTATIVES.                               Explanatory Note.  The  answers  to the  questions  addressed  toX ationalist Representatives  were  discussed  byfour members of the Sub-Committee, and therewas  genera]  agreement  with regard to the  re-plies.  It was suggested  that  as an addendum  tothese answers containing the general Nationalistview about  Customs, Excise,  and Taxation, asummary should  be  given of the  various pro-posals  made  to  safeguard  Ulster Unionists andtrade interests which might  be imperilled  by  anunwise use of the powers  claimed.  The member who added this summary had notan opportunity of showing what he had writtento his colleagues,  and it has since been pointedout  to  him  that the expression  &quot; equality  ofvoting  power between  Unionists  and Nation-alists &quot; (page   ,  fines      ) did  not  preciselyindicate the character of  the suggestion made, asit  was realised  in  discussion that it  would  beimpossible to secure a  definite political characterto members of the Senate, but it was believed tobe possible to guarantee  in the proportions indi-cated the presence  of substantial men with astake in the country who would  safeguard  theinterests for which  the minority in Ireland wereconcerned.   It is necessary,  therefore,  to statethat the closing paragraphs relating to safeguardswere only a summary, and must  be taken withthe limitations and  extensiorts  suggested  in  thediscussion at  the  sub-committee,  of which  nodoubt all the members have full notes.  Question (1). Yes, we consider it essential thatIreland should be able to finance the whole of hergovernment out of taxes  imposed and collectedbv her own Parliament.  Dual control over Irishtaxation  would  prevent the  fulfilment of thiscondition.  It would, therefore, hamper efficientand  economic  government in  Ireland, besidesgiving  opportunities for dangerous  friction  be-tween two taxing authorities, Imperial and Irish.  Our  answers to the four questions put to usunder this head  are as follows:   To (a)  the answer  is No.  For  the  follow -ing reasons: Direct  taxes (less excess profits,                                      I
which will cease in peace), now. bring in lessthan     millions, a  sum not nearly  sufficient tocover the  cost of Irish government, amountingto  over 12i  millions.    Customs  and Exciseduties now yield eleven millions.    Even  sup-posing  that the  proceeds of these  duties werecredited to Ireland,  though  their imposition andcollection remained  in  Imperial hands, between65  and 70 per cent, of Irish tax-revenue wouldbe  subject to outside control, while power  overthe remainder would be  gravely  curtailed,  be-cause  even the  direct  taxes would  have to  bevaried to conform to changes in direct taxationimposed from without.   An  Imperial generaltariff, for example, might raise the yield of Cus-toms  and Excise, while a British Labour Minis-try, raising money mainly by the high taxationof  incomes,  and  lowering indirect  taxation,might compel Ireland automatically  to  raise  herincome-tax.  If on the other hand the  proceeds of Customsand Excise were paid direct  into the  ImperialTreasury the  position would be worse.  A  con-siderable part of these proceeds would have tobe  paid back as  a  subsidy to Ireland  in orderto  meet  the  cost  of Irish  Government,   thebalance  presumably being  retained by GreatBritain  as a  contribution  by Ireland towardsImperial expenditure.   We regard  a system ofsubsidies,  whatever  form it might take, as a badfinancial device  which would sap responsibilityand gravely fetter Ireland&apos;s power to direct  herown legislative and financial policy.  Moreover,the amounts  available  for subsidy and  contribu-tion would necessarily vary as indicated aboveaccording to British fiscal and social policy forthe time being.  It might be proposed (somewhat  on  the linesof  the Act of 1914) to reserve  certain Irish ser-vices for Imperial control, and to finance theseservices out of the proceeds  of Imperial Customsand Excise duties levied in  Ireland.   We regardsuch  a  course as altogether  indefensible.  Be-sides  still further  complicating financial rela-tions,  it would take away from Ireland the re-sponsibility for part of its  own government.  Lastly,  apart  from the effect on  the revenueand expenditure  of  Ireland, the reservation  tothe Imperial Government of Customs and Excisew-ould remove trade and social policy,  so far asthey  can be  influenced by  these duties,  wdiollyfrom the control  of the Irish Parliament.   Wecould  not  agree  to  such a  drastic restriction ofwhat  we  consider an  indispensable  power,though in  the interests of compromise we might agree to  some  reasonable  concession.   (Seejunder (b)  ).  To (b) the answer is that  a compromise mightbe  possible on the lines suggested:  That is,  anarrangement  might  be made for Free Trade be-tween  Ireland and  Great  Britain  in  goods  ofhome produce or manufacture,  with the excep- tion  in regard  to  articles subject  &quot;to Excise.There  should also  (see under  question 3) be  aprovision to guard against unfair competition or dumping.  The  arrangement  should be  termi-nable  and renewable after  a fixed  period, and should  be subject  to  earlier revision  if Great Britain changed her trade policy.  To (e) the answer is  No.  Control  over Ex- cise would involve alterations in Customs Regu-lations, if exercised freely,  and a power of con- trol  over  Excise hampered by  the restrictionthat it would involve no interference with Cus-toms would mean   that  there was no real con-trol  even over Excise,  and would  be  of little orno use.  To  (d)  the answer is  No.  An  Irish Par-liament would desire to have the power to selectthe  articles which  it  proposed to make  duti-able, subject,  of course,  to the restrictions im-plied in the answer to question  (b)  should thearrangement there suggested be  agreed  to.  Question (2).   Yes.   Our fear is  that GreatBritain  would  consult   her  own   economicinterests, which are overwhelmingly greater thanours, and that Irish interests would be neglected.This  fear  is  justified  by past history.  Dutiesmight  be imposed on  raw materials  like steel,which can  be produced  in Great Britain, butnot  in Ireland, and of which  Ireland is  a user,not  a manufacturer.   This would hamper  allindustries  using  steel  in Ireland.    Or,  again,the  agricultural interests might be sacrificed tothe  industrial  interests in  Great  Britain.  Pro-tests  by labour against any taxation. of food protests likely to become louder after the war might lead to a  policy  accepted-by the TariffReformers a few years ago,  which was to admitfood free,  and to place duties on manufacturedarticles.    That  would  tell  against Irish in-terests, the most important of which is  agricul-ture, as we should be buying in a protected mar-ket,  where prices would be artificially sustained,and  selling in a market where there was freecompetition.  With regard to the  second  part of the  ques-tion,  the answer,  as  indicated before,  is thatagreement is  possible  on these lines with thelimitations and provisoes suggested.  Question  (3).   Yes.   It  is  quite  possiblethat  tariff wars with foreign countries might undera fiscal union  result in the denial  to us of neces-sary raw materials, or, more  probably,  in hightariffs against Irish linens,  cottons, liquors, fish,or other articles.  To the second  part of the question  the answeris &quot;  yes,&quot; if Ireland were able to make her ownterms  with foreign countries the  danger wouldbe greatly lessened.  Question (4).    Yes,  if  we had  control  ofExcise  we could remove  restrictions  on themanufacture of industrial alcohol, for example,an  industry  capable  of  great development  inIreland,  or we could encourage the  productionof Irish  tobacco, or, perhaps, sugar-beet.   As itis necessary for us to become more self-support-ing  in the matter  of  food,  and, therefore,  tocultivate  a  much larger area,  it becomes of im-portance to the agricultural interests to  providethat all the crops in rotation shall be profitable.It would be intolerable if the  Irish Governmentwere unable to make  Excise  regulations facili-tating the  manufacture  of  industrial  alcohol.This is simply by way of  illustration.    Underthe  present system  new Irish industries, eventhose which might be deemed proper to  Irelandbecause  of our production of raw  materials suchas hides, wool, etc., suffer severely in competi-tion  with  long-established  leather, boot,  shoe,or woollen industries  in Great Britain,  whichhave no  natural  advantages over Irish  indus-tries, but the  artificial advantage of  priority inestablishment  and  large capital  reserves, en-abling them&quot; to undersell  for a while at a loss tothemselves in  order to knock out  Irish rivalry.
  The fear would be met to  some extent by thepower  inherent in  any  Government  to grantbounties to industry,  and by  the added power(see answer to question 1 (b) ) to impose specialduties  on  goods  which  proved to be  dumped,though we feel bound to point out the difficultyof framing provisions  to ensure  the  proper  ful-filment  of  the latter object.   We  wish to add the following supplementary remarks:     We  regard  Ireland as a Nation, an economic entity.    Governments exist to foster the  eco- nomic  interests  of  their peoples.  Self-govern- ment does not exist where those nominally en- trusted with affairs of government have not cbn- trol  of  fiscal  and economic  policy.  No  Nation with self-respect could accept the idea that while its citizens were regarded as capable of creating wealth  they were  regarded  as  incompetent to regulate the manner  in which  taxation of that wealth  should be  arranged,  and  that another country should have  the power of  levying  and collecting  taxes, the taxed country being placed in the position of a person of infirm mind whose affairs  are regulated by trustees.    No fmaliby .could be looked for in such an arrangement, not even a temporary satisfaction.   It  is  also, in  our opinion,  wrong  to contem- plate continuing these methods of taxation for a poor  country as for a rich.   It is just  as wrong as it would be to have the  same five shillings income-tax on the income  of the  labourer  as on the  income of  the  millionaire.    In Great Britain the average wealth per head is so much greater than in  Ireland that indirect  taxation, which can be borne easily even by the labouring classes,  inflicts the  greatest  hardships on  the same classes in Ireland.   We also wish to point out that  without an Irish  collection of  taxes,  including Custom Houseinspection  of all imported goods, it would be im- possible for us to discover  what was  the  true Irish  revenue.  It has  been  admitted  that  the figures  attributed to Ireland  in the past  in re- spect of income-tax and on dutiable articles liketea are largely based on guess  work.  Without accurate knowledge of our true tax revenue there would always  be  suspicions on the p^art of Ire- land that it was mulcted in sums which did not appear in the Treasury Papers.   Lastly, it may  be said that without an Irish control  over  Customs and Excise, and the  power held  in  reserve of regulating trade  policy with Great Britain, Ireland  would  have no real  bar- gaining power  in case of Great Britain  adopting a  protective  policy.   Irish   representation atWestminster would give less bargaining  powerthan  the right in the hands of an Irish Govern-ment to continue  a policy of free imports, if itso desired,  in  respect of the  raw materials  re-quired for  industry in Ireland, or, on the otherhand,  to protect  its business interests againstforeign  trade combinations.  It is desirable thatsuch  powers should be as little used as  possible,but they should be  held in reserve.  It would,be the worst possible business policy, as it  wouldthe worst possible military policy, never to con-template change, advance or retreat, and to pre-pare for no eventualities.  We say this just asmuch in the  interest of Ulster as in the interestof the Southern farmers.......We agree that  as  few obstacles as possible  should be placed between Ireland and its greatest  customer.   Irish farmers, even more than Ulster  industrialists,  are  concerned  about free  trade,  for their products  are perishable by nature, and  lessen rapidly  in value by delay at ports.  It is  much easier  to  imagine  Ulster  industrialists  changing their views  in this respect than Irish  farmers, and the natural interests  of Irish pro-  ducers are  the  best  protection against unwise  changes  in trade  policy.  We realise that the  industries of Ulster are so important that safe- guards, in addition to those  already suggested,  may  reasonably  be demanded.  The main safe-  guard proposed  is to  give  Ulster  and  other  Unionists political power equal to their economic  interests.    Special   representation  in  both  Houses  of  Parliament would  be agreed  to, so  that  in case of dispute over  questions  affecting Ulster or Unionist interests both Houses  would  sit  together and  an equality of voting power be-  tween Unionists  and Nationalists, so. far as such  a thing  can be arranged in theory, would take  place.   This, it is urged, would give  ample  security  that no  policy would  be adopted  which was not  in  harmony with the  interest of  Ulster industry.   In  conclusion,  we desire to  draw attention to some   other ways  of  meeting  the  fears  of Unionists,  fears  we most  earnestly desire  to allay  by  any means which  do not conflict with the fundamental principles which  we  consider it necessary to maintain.   (1).  The  inconvenience  dreaded  from   Irish fiscal  autonomy might be obviated by means of a small Commission composed  in equal numbers of  members nominated by  the  British and Irish Parliaments, with an independent Chairman, to arrange a trade,  postal, and customs union,  or agreement between  Great  Britain  and Ireland, subject to the  approval of both  Parliaments, and with the provision that, in the event of dis- agreement  in the  Commission,  or disapproval by  either  Parliament,  the  most-favoured-nation terms allowed in  the matter on either side to a foreign or colonial government  should be put in force  by  Royal Proclamation.    On any  Corn- mission of this kind special representation for the  North-East could be secured.   (2).  It  might be  possible  to arrange for an Irish  Parliamentary  Committee  to  which all questions  relating to changes  in  Customs and Excise should be referred,  and in which a pre- ponderating  influence could be given to repre- sentatives of the  great industrial  interests  in Ulster.  As an alternative to  all other suggestions for compromise  put forward in this  Memorandum, a veto exercised by an  Ulster Grand Committee on  matters affecting the special interests of the province might  in the last resort be considered. We  regard this as  the least desirable form  of compromise, and would prefer that Ulster would accept the larger  representation in both  Houses of  Parliament  as  the  right  method of  safe- guarding  their interests.  By this method  Irish interests would be considered all  together,  as  is most desirable.  The friction at  present unfor- tunately existing  between Ulster and the  rest of Ireland would  not be perpetuated.   A  veto would  also prevent practical  and constitutional difficulties of a grave nature,  and if other  pro- . vinces demand the same power, Irish legislation and  administration would be involved in a tangle of complexities.I 2
                                       SCHEDULE VI.REPLIES BY MR. W. M. MURPHY TO QUESTIONS FOR NATIONALIST REPRESENTA-        TIVES SUBMITTED  BY SIR  HORACE PLUNKET, 6th NOVEMBER, 1917.  Question.   (1).  Are you afraid  that  unless  Ireland hasfiscal autonomy the  Irish Government  will notbe  able to adjust  its controllable  tax-revenue toits expenditure?  Would  it  satisfy you  if Ireland had control(a) over  direct taxation  only  or  (b)  over bothdirect  and indirect taxation  subject to the limi-tation as  to free trade with England, or (c) overExcise  but not Customs, or (d)  over the ratesof Customs duties but  not over the selection ofthe articles subjected to  them?  Answer.  (1). In  order to answer this question intelli-gently it  would be necessary to be sure what ismeant by &quot;Controllable Tax Revenue.&quot;   I takeit from the context that it  means partial fiscalautonomy as distinct from full fiscal autonomy,and on that assumption it appears to me that itwould  be  impossible  to adjust Revenue to Ex-penditure if  one set of Taxes were voted by  anIrish  Parliament  and another set by a BritishParliament.  Moreover, it would leave the IrishParliament only partially responsible for raisingthe Taxes which the Irish Government was ex-pending,  and it would take away from them theincentive  to  economy in  almost as great a de-gree- as if the whole of  the Irish Taxes werelevied  by the  British  Parliament and  handedover to be expended by  an Irish Government.  In answer  to the second part of this question,no fiscal system would satisfy me that does notgive an Irish Parliament plenary powers over allIrish Taxes,  including Customs and Excise, andall  other  sources  of Irish Revenue.  Question.  (2). Are you afraid  that  if, under  a fiscalunion, England became protectionist some of theduties imposed might injure Irish interests (c.g.,a duty on steel)?  Would  you  be  satisfied if fiscal union onlywent as far as  to  secure mutual free trade ?  Answer.  (2). I am quite sure that  if England becameProtectionist  no regard would be  had  to Irishinterests  where they  did not harmonise  withBritish  interests,  and I  do  not look  upon anyrepresentation  that Ireland  could  claim in aHouse of more than seven hundred members atWestminster as any  protection in this respect.No British Budget was ever  directly affected byanything  that could be done by Irish Members.   With regard to the second paragraph  of thisquestion,  I would be willing to consider a Com-mercial Treaty between Great Britain and Ire-land, under Home Rule with full fiscal authority,for  the  free  interchange  of the  produce andmanufactures of  both countries, with provisionagainst dumping,  though  I  would prefer thatthis Treaty should be  arranged between the twoParliaments after the Irish Parliament was estab-lished.   Question.   (8).  Are you. afraid  that  if,  under completefiscal union,. England  became protectionist andbecame   involved  in  tariff   wars with  foreigncountries, Irish industries might suffer,?   Would  the same remedy meet this fear (Ire-land being  able  to make  her own terms witliforeign countries)?  Answer.   (3).  Y&quot;es.   For reply to  the  second part  ofquestion  see reply to  second part of Question 2.  Question.   (4).  Are you  afraid  that  under fiscal  unionIreland would be unable to encourage new in-dustries or protect industries  from  &quot;dumping&quot;?   Would  this fear be  met by  power to grantbounties  and to impose special duties on goodsproved to  be  &quot; dumped &quot;?  Answer.   (4). Without fiscal  freedom I  feel  sure thatIreland could do little  or nothing to encouragenew industries  or to  protect industries from&quot; dumping.&quot;  My  fears on this head would bemet in a large degree by power to grant bountiesand to impose special duties  on goods proved tobe  &quot; dumped &quot; which would  be incidental to ameasure of full fiscal autonomy.Dear Sir Horace,  In reply to the communication which you haveaddressed  to  us we  must point  out  that thedifference which  has brought  the proceedings ofthe  Sub-Committee &quot; nearly  to  a  deadlock &quot;rests on points of  principle and not of detail.  We  hold that  in matters of fiscal policy andeconomic life  the  interests  of Ireland are in-separable from those of Great  Britain, and thatthere can be  no Customs barrier  or differentia-tion of taxation between the  two  countries,which  are,  and  must continue to  be,  so inti-mately associated.  Y7ou   submit  the following  view  &quot; in  thepresent state  of Nationalist opinion it would beuseless to propose  any such  restriction on thetaxing  powers of an  Irish  Parliament as theLE VII.                       14i7i November, 1917.reservation  of  Customs  and  Excise  to  theBritish Parliament.&quot;  To set out our apprehensions of the  use  towhich powers of control  of  either direct or in-direct taxation  might be put  by an Irish  Par-liament  would be an  ungrateful task  which wedo not propose to undertake.   It has been madeclear to us, however,  that one object would beattained by  their  acquisition,  and that  is toescape from  all liability for  National  Debt andfrom bearing any share in the cost of the war orof national defence  in the  future  beyond suchvoluntary contribution as an  Irish Parliamentshould from time to time think fit to make.  You say rightly that &quot; to the great majority ofthe  Nationalists  fiscal  autonomy, advocated as
a means of industrial development at home,  andof  economic  expansion,  abroad,  appeals  evenmore   strongly  as   a  symbol  of   pohticalautonomy.&quot;  To go  further  and say  that  theadoption of this doctrine of Irish fiscal autonomywill,  under  a;  Colonial  form  of  government,separate all  our interests  from Great Britainmust inevitably lead  to  the  same  goal as theSinn  Feiners  desire to reach under  a republic.  The demand is, in fact, that Ireland shall beseparated absolutely  from  Great  Britain and,except  for the sovereignty  of the King, occupythe  position of* an  independent nation.   Thismeans  that Ireland,  desirous of increasing herindustrial activities  and with practically no  rawmaterials within herself,  will be cut adrift fromthe  strongest  commercial  power in  the  worldand have to rely upon her  own resources  in thewelter of economic. trouble with which  the worldwill be surrounded at the conclusion of the war.  You will thus realise that  the question does notdepend  on  small  accommodations  such as areput forward; the question is far wider, more im-portant, and, indeed, vital.  We are satisfied that for Ireland  and for GreatBritain  a common system  of Finance with oneExchequer is a fundamental essential,  and thatIrish  industrial  and  commercial interests andthe development of our resources can  be bestfurthered in full  community with the economiclife of the great industrial people with whom wehave so  much in common  and from whom werefuse to be divorced.  You express the hope that some compromisemay yet be  found, and that we should  go  onwith the work  of &quot; exploring the Irish  pohticalproblem  in all its  aspects.&quot;  We consider thatto do so without making  a clear  statement ofwhat we  regard as  a fundamental  conditionwould  be to leave us  open to  the reproach ofcarrying  on the business of the Convention underfalse pretences.   Having  stated  our  position  onthis matter we are willing  to give considerationto any further schemes that may be put  beforeus.                  Yours faithfully,      (Signed)     HUGH  T. BARBIE,              Chairman Ulster  Representatives,      (Signed)    LONDONDERRY,                             Hon.  Secretary.           SCHEDULE VIII.PROPOSALS FOR  A  COMPROMISE.Customs.  1.  It  is essential that the  Irish Governmentshould have under its control  sources of revenuesufficient to cover the cost of  the services whichit administers.  2.  It  should, therefore, be recognised that, inprinciple,  all heads of Irish revenue should  besubject  to such control.  8.  At the same time it  should be recognisedthat  a contribution from Ireland to the cost ofImperial Services is called for, not primarily inthe interests of Great Britain, but because re-luctance to accept an obligation of honour wouldbe derogatory  to the  dignity and self-respect ofIreland.  4.  Any  such contribution ought  to be  placedon a definite basis which would remove it fromthe sphere of  Parliamentary  controversy.  5.  The easiest way to achieve this  is to makeit a  definite charge against a  particular head ofrevenue.  6.  It  is suggested that  the most  convenienthead is  the Customs. -  7.  The desirability of maintaining Free Tradebetween Great  Britain and Ireland for a term ofyears being  admitted,  and  Imperial  Servicesbeing made  a  first charge on the Customs reve-nue  by  the  arrangement above  suggested, it isonly  a small concession to leave the impositionof  Customs  Duties to the  British Governmentfor the duration of the  proposed Free  Tradearrangement.  8.  The fact that this  compromise would  re-lieve the anxiety felt by Ulster is a strong argu-ment in its favour.  9.  The increasing prospect of a federalisationof  the British  Isles  is an  additional argument,for should this prospect be realised it is certainthat Customs must be an item of Federal Reve-nue.  10. The imposition of Customs Duties  shouldbe left to the Imperial Parliament; the collectionshould be  made under the authority of a JointBoard on which Ireland should have equal repre-sentation with Great Britain,  and the determi-nation of the share of Customs Revenue attri-butable  to  Ireland  should also  rest  with  thisBoard.  11. The whole of this share  should be carriedto the credit of Ireland, and the &quot; contributionto Imperial purposes &quot; (which should be speci-fied in  the Constitution Act,  either as a fixedsum, or as an amount variable on a sliding scale)should be the first charge upon it.  12. If the  Customs  revenue  attributable  toIreland in any year is less than the amount fixedas the &quot; contribution to Imperial Services,&quot; thebalance of that amount should be written off  asirrecoverable.  13. If the Customs  revenue  exceeds the  Im-perial contribution,  the balance should be  at thedisposal  of  the Irish Government.  14. This arrangement will have  the followingadvantages:    (1). It recognises in principle Ireland&apos;s claim      to fiscal  autonomy.  (2). It meets, in  practice, the difficulties felt      by Ulster.  (3.) It leaves Ireland full control over revenues      sufficient to meet the cost of her services.  (4). It  removes  the vexed  question  of  an      Imperial contribution from  the  sphere  of      controversy.  (5). It makes easy the transition to a Federal      System,  should  such become probable  in      the future.
   15.. It would be easy to add  to this arrange- ment  provisions for the prevention of dumping, as between  Great Britain and  Ireland, on the lines already suggested.  A draft indicating the kind of provisions which would  be necessary  is set out below. Draft  anti-dumping  Provisions.   (1).  There shall be  established a Board to be called  the  Joint Customs  Board,  consisting of two members appointed by the Treasury, and a Chairman appointed by His Majesty.   (2).  If the Irish  Government be  of  opinion that the producers, growers,  or manufacturers of any article in Ireland  are  being subjected to unfair  competition  through the importation into Ireland from Great Britain of articles which byreason of State aid,  industrial combination,  orother cause are. being sold at a  price less thanthe actual cost of manufacture, distribution, andsale with  the  addition of  a fair  commercialprofit;  or if the British Government   ....(etc., etc., mutatis mutandis);  then the IrishGovernment,  or the British Government, as the case, may be, may  require&apos; the  Joint  Customs Board to investigate the matter.   (3). The  Joint Customs Board,  on being so required, shall investigate the matter  with all convenient  despatch, and shall  report to both Governments whether in fact such unfair corn- petition exists, and if so, what rate or rates of Custom Duty or Duties would be sufficient to counteract it.   (4). On the  issue of such a report, it shall be lawful for the Irish, or  British,,  Parliament, as the  case may  be, to impose Customs Duties on said articles  of British or Irish growth, produce, or manufacture to the extent found by the Joint Customs  Board  to be  sufficient  to counteract the  unfair competition.  (5). Any Customs  Duties  imposed in accord- ance with  the provisions of  the foregoing para- graph shall be immediately  discontinued if the Joint Customs Board shall report that the unfair competition which  gave  rise to their impositionhas ceased.   Final Report of the  Sub-Committee  to the  In our Interim Report dated November 15th,we stated that we had still to consider a proposalto be  submitted by Lord  Londonderry.   Sincethe date of that Report we have held two meet-ings, on November 20th and 21st.  On the for-mer date we  made a further attempt to find acompromise on the fiscal question, but we regretthat we were not successful.  In view of  thecontinued  disagreement,   the Ulster  represen-tatives preferred not to submit any scheme,  andLord Londonderry&apos;s proposals, referred to in ourInterim  Report,  have, therefore,  not been  laidbefore us.  We  desire  to  supplement that  Report  bymaking certain  explanatory amendments in theProvisional Conclusions  set  forth  in  ScheduleII.  The note to Head 3, sub-head (3)  (a) and (b)should read:         &quot;  These were  deferred for  further  con-    sideration, pending the Report of the Sub-    Committee 0??

                                      APPENDIX   V.REPORT  OF  SUB-COMMITTEE  ON  ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS AND AREAS.                                       (I.  C. No,  18.)  The  Electoral  Systems  Sub-Committee  wasappointed &quot; to consider the question of ElectoralSystems, Areas and Franchises.&quot;  The  members  of the  Committee were,  HisGrace the Archbishop of Dublin (Chairman), theEarl of Granard,  Sir  William Goulding, Bart.,Alderman M&apos;Carron,  Messrs.  R. Waugh,  P. J.0&apos;Neill, T. J. Harbison, and E.  E.  Lysaght.  Nine meetings were  held, in which the generalsubject  was carefully  considered as well as thequestion of how to provide adequate representa-tion  for minority interests.  The leading Electoral Systems  were examined,including  Proportional Representation  with theSingle  Transferable Vote,  and  the  Belgian Sys-tem  with  plural voting -plus Proportional Repre-sentation.   The  Secretary of  the  Proportionalrepresentation  Society also conducted a demon-stration election in order to. illustrate the work?ing details of a  contested election under this sys-tem.  The  composition of an  Upper and  a LowerHouse,  with respect to numbers, and also to thevarious  elements  which  should find representa-tion  in  these assemblies, was discussed at con-siderable length.  The  question  of providing  representation forurban interests  by grouping towns of 2,000 popu-lation and upwards so as  to form special  urbanconstituencies was carefully  examined,  and  atable of statistics bearing upon  this  subject isattached herewith.  The   Sub-Committee  desire it to be  clearlyunderstood that their  recommendations are notto be  taken as more than provisional conclu-sions.  If agreement can be reached in the  Con-vention by other methods of distribution of elec-tion, or nomination of  members to either House,they are quite ready to consider them sympathe-tically.                 FINDINGS.  The  Sub-Committee agreed that  the Unionistminority should in an Irish Parliament receiverepresentation in excess of its relative numericalproportion to the rest  of the electorate.  They  also  agreed that  having regard  to thesmallness of the  Unionist electorate  in  manycounties the Proportional Representation systemwould  not give  representation to the  Unionistminority.  The Sub-Committee  were not prepared to saythat  the Belgian system would meet the necessi-ties of  the case as existing in Ireland.  The  suggestion of nominating  representativesof the minority interest was in general terms ap-proved.   Nomination to  be by  the  Crown.  The terms of the Representation of the PeopleBill were approved as to the qualifying period ofresidence and as  to the  disqualification of  pau-pers.  It  was the view of a &quot;majority of the membersthat  the proposals of this Bill in  regard to man-hood and womanhood  suffrage are desirable andshould  be extended to Ireland.  In so far as Trade Unions are concerned, theLabour  representatives of  the  Sub-Committeewere  of opinion that it  would not be  desirablethat Labour organisations  should be  empoweredto elect direct representatives to  the House ofCommons, as such  action would  in their  viewtend to break up Trade Unions into political sec-tions.  The general view  of the Committee  was thatthere should not be  direct  representation for In-stitutions  in the Lower House, with the excep-tion of Universities,  and that in any  Irish  redis-tribution  scheme  the  boroughs  of  Belfast,Dublin,   Cork,  Londonderry,  Limerick,  andWaterford should be retained.  For the remain-ing constituencies redistribution should be on thebasis of population  as  fai&quot; as may be reasonablypracticable.  As to the composition of  an Irish House  ofCommons the view was expressed that the mem-bership should be 197, of  whom 157 should  beelected and  40 nominated  by the  Crown in theinterests of  the  Unionist minority.   The distri-bution of  those elected to be  as follows:     Borough of Belfast   ...      ...    14                Dublin   ...      ...    11                Cork     ...      ...  *  4                Derry    ...      ...     2          ,,      Limerick         ...     2                Waterford        ...     1    University of Dublin ...      ...     2                  Belfast         \.     1    National University   ...      ...     1    Elected      ...       ...      ...   119    Nominated           ...      ...    .40                                       197  These views are subject to the qualifications:        That the  Labour members of the  Sub-    Committee  did not approve of University    representation, and that the  Chairman pre-    feried a smaller number of nominated mem-    bers and a number of elected representatives    &quot;for other interests or institutions.  The question  of  enlarging the  area of  Dublinborough so as to include the Metropolitan Policearea and  give  Dublin 14  members  and  reducethe County Dublin representation by three mem-bers was  after  consideration left to  the GrandCommittee.               THE   SENATE.  It was suggested that  the Senate should con-sist of  60 members  and  be  composed as fol-lows:        4 Bishops, R.C. Church.       2 Bishops, Church  of Ireland.       1 representative,  Presbyterian Church.       1 Lord  Chancellor.      15 Representative  Peers.      15 nominated by the Crown.       3 to be elected for  Connaught.       5                  Munster.       6         ,,         Leinster.       8         ,,         Ulster.
   These provincial representatives to be electedby popular vote on  the  General Franchise.   Tenure of office generally to be ten years, andall members to be unpaid.   It was the opinion of the Committee that thereshould be a certain number of persons elected tothe Upper House on a popular franchise.   TheChairman  and Sir William Goulding  dissentedfrom  this view.   On the  representation of  the  Labour  mem-bers it was agreed not to recommend .the direct-representation of Labour in  the  Upper  House,consequently,  Mr. Lysaght,  Mr.  Harbison,  andLord  Granard held that there should not be anydirect  representation from  Chambers  of Com-merce.  Notwithstanding, the suggested absenceof such Labour representation the Chairman, SirWilliam Goulding, and Mr. P. J. 0&apos;Neill thoughtthat commercial interests should  be  representedin the Upper House.  The Committee  were divided on the questionas to whether there should be any representationfor bodies such as the Incorporated Law Society,the Benchers, the College of Surgeons,  Collegeof Physicians, Board of Agriculture,  Royal IrishAcademy, and Royal Dublin  Society.  Those infavour of such representation were  Sir  WilliamGoulding, Mr. Lysaght,  Mr.  0&apos;Neill, Mr.  Har-bison,  and the Chairman.   The other  membersof the Committee were opposed to any represen-tation of such special interests.  In the. opinion of the Committee  it was notnecessary to provide specially for the  inclusionof Law Lords in the Upper House,  as the judi-cial element would probably be fully  representedthrough other sections.  Section 12,  sub-section 3,  of  the Governmentof Ireland Act, 1914, as follows,  was approved:       &quot; Any Peer whether  of the United King-    dom,  Great Britain, England, Scotland, or    . Ireland shall be  qualified to be a member of    either House.&quot; SPECIAL REPRESENTATION OF URBAN                INTERESTS.  The  question  of  giving special representationto urban populations having, at the request ofLord Southborough, been further considered, thefollowing opinion was expressed:   On the hypothesis that the quota for rural con-stitueneies should be 35,000, and for urban consti-tuencies 20,000, it  would appear that the num-ber  of  members  representing  urban  interestsmight be about 62, while rural members wouldbe about 91.   On the simpler hypothesis on theother hand that equal weight should be given tothe urban and rural vote, and that the quota foreach constituency should be 30,000, the numberof urban  members would  be  about  42,  whilethere would be about 111 rural members.   Thus,so far  as the  Sub-Committee can see,  after de-tailed  examination, the :effect  of carrying  outLord Southborough&apos;s suggestion would be to in-crease the urban representation by about 24 in aHouse of 157 members.  It would increase theurban  representation in the province of Ulsterfrom .20 to  29.  Another method of strengthening the urban re-presentation was proposed by Mr. Lysaght, viz.that the existing small boroughs of Newrv Gal-way, aiid Kilkenny be retained, and that &quot;similarrepresentation be extended to towns  of  10,000inhabitants  and upwards.   Under this proposalthe towns of Lisburn, Lurgan, Portadown, Ballv-mena,  Dundalk, Drogheda,  Wexford, Clonmel,Tralee,  and Sligo would each be entitled  to oneParliamentary representative as their respectivepopulations exceed 10,000.  Ten  new  boroughs would  thus be created inaddition  to the existing three proposed to be  re-tained.  Under this  scheme  the urban  representationwould  be 50,  and the non-urban 103,  togetherwith four University members.           (Signed),    JOHN  DUBLIN, &apos;             Chairman of Sub-Committee.  NOTE ON  URBAN  REPRESENTATION.              By E.  Lysaght.  The principle-proposed by Lord Southboroughin his letter to the Sub-Committee of fixing avery much lower quota for  urban divisions thanfor  rural is open to the objection:  That it  isfrankly undemocratic.  Again, grouping of small towns is open, as wehave  seen,  to the objection that. the  smallertowns are  semi-rural,  and  that such  groupingcould not be successfully carried out.  We haveseen  that Lord Southborough&apos;s proposal wouldincrease  the urban representation in  an IrishParliament.  It is possible to do this, I think, by a simplermeans, viz., to recognise the principle hitherto  inoperation in Ireland  of separate  representationfor  the larger towns even though they are veryconsiderably below  the  quota decided upon.  Newry, Galway, and  Kilkenny now have suchseparate representation.  I would propose  that this  be  continued,  andextended to all towns of similar size.  If repre-sentation be extended to towns of 10,000 inhabit -ants and over, ten  new boroughs would  be en-franchised in addition to the three I would pro-pose to retain, but which  it has hitherto beenagreed to disfranchise.  Lisburn, Lurgan,  Porta-down,  Ballymena, Dundalk,  Drogheda, Wexford,Clonmel, Tralee,&apos; Sligo  are  all  over  10,000 in-habitants.  The constituencies would then be as shown onattached Schedule, giving 50 urban and 106 ruralmembers and four  University members.  Withfour University members the  lower house wouldthen contain less than two-thirds rural members.  The result is  only seven  less  urban membersthan  that arrived at by adopting Lord  South-borough&apos;s suggestion.  In  the attached  Schedule  I  have given  themembers and  population per county  rather thanper division, because the size of  the divisions de-pends  on whether the  principle of ProportionalRepresentation be adopted or not.

But ifthe boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry be ex-cluded, the grand total for the remaining thirty-seven Ulster  towns is only 185,340.   In additioneighteen  of Ulster &apos;s thirty-seven towns are in thecounties  of,Antrim  and  Down,  and their  jointpopulation is 98,033, or considerably more  thanhalf the  total for Ulster towns.   Separate repre-sentation  for  the  urban interests of Antrim andDown is  possible by a system of grouping.   It isalso practicable in County Armagh to the extentthat  Portadown  and  Lurgan  being in the  sameconstituency  and  contiguous could  easily hegrouped.  It  should  be pointed  out  that  in many in-stances the smaller  towns are strictly rural, orrather  non-industrial  in  their interests,  beingmerely market  towns, and  not manufacturingcentres.mHi
  In the province of Leinster there is a similarconcentration of urban, population in one. or twoareas and diffusion in the rest of the province. Inthe county of Dublin the townships of Kings-town, Pembroke,  and  Rathmines  account  for84,353  out of a total of 101,963.  These townsmay be regarded rather  as  suburbs of Dublinthan as distinctive civic entities.   Drogheda andDundalk in county Louth, though somewhat re-mote from each other, could be grouped  similarlyto Portadown and Lurgan, but many other townsin Leinster would require special grouping.

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS SUB-COMMITTEE.  Supplemental Report to Grand Committee.  The Grand Committee of the Irish Conventionhaving considered  the report  of  the  ElectoralSystems  Committee  sent  the  following  furtherReference to the latter body  for considerationand report.  The Grand Committee accepted the principlethat urban and industrial interests should receivemore than proportionate representation,  and re-quested  the Sub-Committee on  Electoral  Sys-                                 PROVINCECo.

Towns with a population below 3,000 only to be included in such consti- tuencies  if they are of  a  distinctly industrial character.  *   The Electoral Systems  Sub-Committee having carefully considered  this  Reference  from  the Grand  Committee  submits the following group- ings of towns as electoral  units: OF ULSTER.

Their aggregate  sub-stantially exceeds 80,000, and they would there -fore on  the 20,000 quota  be entitled  to  fom;representatives,  which  would  make  the grandtotal  of  urban representatives  for Ireland fifty-four.   If included in the borough of Dublin, theborough  would be entitled to three  more mem-bers than  are credited to it  in the  above list.The grand total in that case would be fifty-three.  The Sub-Committee  understands  that  therewould probably be opposition to inclusion in&apos; the&quot;borough  of Dublin.  It will be observed that in some of the group -ings the  figure of population is  slightly below the20,000 quota.  In  two instances  towns of lessthan 3,000 population are included on the groundthat they are specially industrial.  The attention of the Grand Committee  is in-vited to the changes which the suggested newconstituencies would  involve  in the  Parliamen-tary areas to which they at present belong.  Thegrouping of Dundalk and Drogheda, for example,would reduce  County Louth from  63,665  to38,036, and North Armagh would be  reduced byover  one-half.   Every area touched  would ob-viously be substantially affected by  the changeand re-adjustment of  the  boundaries of  ruralParliamentary divisions would clearly have to bemade in a considerable number  of cases in orderto prevent anomaly and injustice.  The fixing ofsuch boundaries demands expert knowledge,  andalso is outside the Terms of Reference submittedto us.  The grouping suggested above  is, in the opinionof the  Committee,  the most  convenient  andworkable that they  can devise in  the circum-stances.  The population of the above groupedtowns is 352,350, leaving a population of 257,093in towns of 2,000 and  upwards, which do  notconform to the Terms of Reference,  or are in-capable of being suitably grouped.  In  considering  the  Terms of  Reference  in-dieated in this Supplemental Report, Sir Craw-ford McCullagh and Mr. H. B. Armstrong, D.L.,joined the  Sub-Committee  and are  associatedwith the recommendations  as above.  The Sub-Committee  are  under the greatestobligations   to their  Secretary, Mr. ThomasMoles, for the invaluable services which he  hasrendered to them  throughout.

The principle  of adding members nominated- by the   Lord Lieutenant  to  represent Southern  Unionists is approved.

Arrangements to be made to permit the Irish Government, if they  so desire, to  defer  taking over the services relating  to  Land Purchase, Old Age Pensions, National  Insurance.  Labour  Ex- changes,  Post Office Trustee  Savings  Banks,  andFriendly Societies.       Discussed, but  not definitely  decided  by    the Committee.  Li so far as Land Purchase    is  concerned,  reference  should be made  to    the report of the Sub-Committee.
                                          (I. C  The Chairman of the Convention having statedthat in his  opinion a deadlock appeared to  havebeen reached in reference to the question whetherIreland should have complete fiscal control, it isnecessary that I should add something on behalfof those whom I represent in order to make  clearour attitude on this question.  While we have not changed our view that thepreservation of  the  Union of Great  Britain  andIreland under the Imperial Parliament is still thebest policy for both countries, we entered the Con-vention at the urgent request of H.M.  Governmentwith the desire to consider what  concession couldbe made to Nationalist opinion in regard to a Con-stitution, with safety to the Empire, security&apos; forthe minority, and  if possible, the  participationof all sections in Irish  Government  which  couldnot be obtained  under  the Act of 1914.  We have endeavoured loyally to co-operate withour colleagues in the Convention  to this  end, andwe recognise their desire to provide the  minoritywith a fair  representation in both Houses of theproposed  -Parliament.    Assuming   this  to besecured, and that adequate arrangements for  safe-guarding  the  special interests  of Ulster can beagreed upon,  we have  no desire to circumscribetoo closely the powers of the new Irish Bodies inregard to internal administration.  But the discussions which have  arisen on thequestion of Fiscal Autonomy open a new vistaof Irish claims, which was wholly unexpected byus.   We  have  contemjDlated  a    Parliamentgenuinely subordinate to that of Great  Britain,and that&apos; Ireland, which must be  dependent onGreat Britain  for defence and for Foreign Policy,would send  representatives  to  Westminster topsafeguard her interests,  and to represent her inregard to taxation not of an internal character.  The Nationalist representatives  have claimed forIreland a similar right in connection with treatiesto that enjoyed by the Dominions.   The proba-bility of divergence from Great Britain  on fiscalquestions seems  to us  to have  been suggested,and the necessity of Ireland being free to play herown hand in  these matters asserted.  It is noteworthy that while independent powersfor Ireland in regard to finance and administrationare claimed, and Great Britain&apos;s willingness toundertake her defence is assumed, there is no clearadmission of responsibility for the liabilities whichIreland has incurred,  and will  incur, to GreatBritain  in this  respect.  We are convinced that the future prosperity andsecurity  of the country can  only be secured bythe representation of Ireland in the British  Par-liament,  and by leaving all taxation which is thesubject of treaty  in the hands of that Parliament.Indeed, we believe this connection to be  vital inthe interests of the Empire.  This contention, is not inconsistent with Irelandhaving the desired, control of her.  own affairs, andof direct internal, taxation,  with ample meansNo. 21.) to pay her way, but if Ireland is still to remain an integral part of the British Empire, she must be prepared  to make some sacrifice  commensurate to that which  Great  Britain is making.    Ireland,  notwithstanding  the  present   War Taxation, is apparently increasing in prosperity by leaps  and bounds.   If she is assured of her present expenditure,  and the power of increasing revenue for development, she cannot but contribute reasonably  to  the immense deficit which  Great Britain has to face.    If Great Britain were willing  to accept as a con- tribution  to the War debt and to the Army and Navy  the product of the  Customs, which now amount to   6,600,000 and  may  probably be in- creased. Ireland  (omitting Excess Profits) Avould still retain  some   12,000,000  tax  revenue,  with  1,600,000  from  Postal  and  non-tax  revenue, against  12,500,000 of expenditure.   There would then be a considerable surplus  which may be in- creased when the Super-tax on  Irish Revenue now paid in London is levied locally, as it must be in the future, if a Parliament is established.   On the most favourable computation for Ireland,. the debt charges for  which her taxable capacity, whether reckoned at one-twrentieth or one-twenty- fifth of Great Britain, should render her liable, would now amount to  12,000,000 annually apart from her share of Defence and War Pensions winch would be at the least  6,000,000 more.   Ireland would have received exceptionally generous  treatment by such a settlement seeing that Great Britain will have a deficit  of  say,   150,000,000 per annum to meet, while retaining  all existing taxation except excess profits.   To  clothe Ireland  with the right of making treaties and to  demand an equal voice with Great Britain on questions which are common to the whole- Empire, and which may shortly be the subject  of Federation,  w*ould  set up a Government on the Colonial model  with only the link of the. Crown, separate from Great Britain, though at a few miles- distance.   It has  been  admitted that to avoid continual  friction it would be necessary to secure Free Trade  between  Great  Britain and Ireland. The interests of both countries make  a common defence a necessity, and wre believe that the power now claimed for Ireland to negotiate for 4,000,000 of-people on an equality with 44,000,000 while she cannot pay  her proper share of defence, is  quite inadmissible.   Our proposals then are as follows :    We  reserve  to  Great  Britain  the  Sovereign power of the King, full authority for the Navy,. Army,  and Imperial Services, and for the levying of Customs, and  this responsibility involves the continued  presence  of  Irish representatives  at Westminster, although  in diminished  numbers. We think that the question of  excise calls for special  treatment.   The full amount realised by Customs should be retained by Great Britain as an Imperial contribution                                     L2                    PART  I.MEMORANDUM  BY  SOUTHERN  UNIONISTS.            FISCAL   AUTONOMY.
  We are ready, if the Irish Parliament be con---stituted  as  proposed with fair  representation  ofthe minority and other effective safeguards whichare in our view essential, to concede to it control-of  internal  taxes,  administration,   legislation,judicature, and police.   On these lines we behovethat  all legitimate  National  aspirations  will  besatisfied.    We are  not prepared to jeopardisethe  Imperial connection by conceding more  ex-treme demands.   In thus  co-operating to transfer to&apos; an IrishExecutive responsibility to an Irish  Parliamentfor its internal affairs,. wre have  gone as we behoveto the extreme limit of safety from the Imperialstandpoint, having regard to  the geographical-contiguity of Ireland to Great  Britain and  her-social and  political conditions.    To  do  this, inresponse to the appeal of H.M. Government underthe special circumstances of the time, we have madesacrifice of principles very dear to us in the hopethat by mutual agreement as Irishmen we may heallong standing differences.  We believe the proposals outlined above, whichgive wide powers of self-government to Ireland,preserve to the  British Government those onlywhich are necessary for the unity and security ofthe United Kingdom, and which would be reservedto the Central Government under any system ofFederation which may unite the Empire in thefuture.                            MIDLETON.2Qth November, 1917.                                       PABT II.PROPOSALS BY  SOUTHERN UNIONISTS AS TO JOINT REVENUE BOARD.  Under the  proposals  made  by  the SouthernUnionists, Customs duties will  be imposed underthe authority of the Parliament of  the UnitedKingdom and Excise duties  under the authorityof the Irish  Parliament.  A substantial amount of the  Customs duties onarticles ultimately consumed in Ireland is collectedat British ports, and it is desirable to frame somemachinery for establishing what the true revenueproduced by Ireland is after the two Exchequersare separated.  This  is the more  necessary as the  Customsduties and Excess Profits receipts are only to beassigned to meet  the Imperial contribution duringthe war, and until the Commission proposed byLord MacDonnell has  reported what the futurecontribution of Ireland should  be.  Meantime anydeficit in other  Irish  revenue will be made uptrom Customs receipts if necessary.  The proposed separate Excise regime in Irelandwill make it necessary to regulate the  traffic inexcisable articles  between the two countries .o asto  protect the  revenue, and prevent smugglingwhile causing the least possible inconvenience tolegitimate trade.  The most  convenient  method of fulfilling thetwo purposes indicated would seem  to be thecreation of a Joint Revenue Board on  the linesof the Joint Exchequer Board contemplated bythe Act of 1914, consisting of two British and twoIrish representatives with  a  Chairman appointedby His Majesty.  The function described above would not exhaustthe usefulness of  the proposed Board..   Its dutiesshould be :-   1. To determine the true Customs  revenue  of     Ireland and  to set up appropriate machinery     for the purpose in the form of actual records     of traffic.   2.  To regulate the payment  of drawback on     exportation,  and the levying of  duty on     importation  of excisable  articles from one     country into the other;  and  to  provide for     the  mutual  interchange  between  the two   countries  of  the information  necessary  to   prevent illicit traffic.   (For example, if Irish   spirits  be exported  to  England, the English   revenue authorities  would  be notified when   drawback was claimed, so that the charging   of Customs duty might follow automatically).- 3.  To determine  any  questions  which might   arise, in the case of  direct taxation, as to the   respective rights of England  and Ireland to   levy tax  on  property  or income  when  the   owner of such property or income was resident   partly in England and partly in Ireland.  No   property or income should  be hable to pay   double tax, and the Joint Board should give   a final decision which would render reference   to the Court unnecessary, and relieve the tax-   payer from liability to proceedings brought   by the revenue authorities to  determine their   resjicctive  claims.    A considerable increase   of  Irish  revenue is  anticipated  from this   source. 4.  The Board would also be  charged with the   duty of advising the respective Governments   on cases of &quot; dumping &quot;  designed to damage   Irish industries.     The  Board would not  be  directly  con-   cerned with  the collection of revenue  but   would  act partly in an advisory and partly   in a judicial  capacity,  and would  determine   all questions of account which might arise   between the  two countries. 5,  To consider the relative proportions of in-   direct  and direct taxation in  Ireland, and   if  the  percentage of revenue from Customs   and Excise to  total tax revenue in Ireland   exceeds in two consecutive years the similar   percentage in Great Britain by 15  per cent.   to report  the same to  the  Irish Parliament.      Should  the  Irish  Parliament  thereupon   resolve that any Customs  duties on articles   of general consumption  act  oppressively to   the Irish  population, the Board shall so re-   port to  the  British Parliament,  and  such   report shall  be a ground  for  the  equitable   readjustment of such  duties.
&apos;  STATEMENT  MADE  BY THE CHAIRMAN  TO THE CONVENTION AT THE REQUEST                            OF  THE GRAND COMMITTEE.                                         (I.  C. No. 19).  By a resolution passed  at  Cork on  the  25thSeptember the  Convention referred  to us  thevarious  schemes which had been submitted  anddiscussed, and instructed us, if possible, to pr.e-pare a scheme for submission to the  Conventionwhich would  meet with the views and difficultiesexpressed by the  different speakers  during thecourse of the debates.  We  had hoped  that it  might be  possible tosummon the  Convention at an earlier date,  andreport  the completion of  our  task.   Unfortu-nately we have  not \et succeeded in completingit.   We have,  however, made considerable  pro-gress, and we think that we have reached a pointat which we should give the  Convention an ac-count of our  deliberations.  We  held our  first meeting  for the purpose ofthe task entrusted to us on September 27th andthen decided to adjourn until  October 11th inorder to enable the necessary preparatory  workto be carried out by the Secretariat.   On October11th we decided to appoint a Sub-Committee ofnine members with instructions to sit in privateto endeavour to find a basis for agreement and toreport to us.  On October  15th we decided  thatthere were several important questions  the  comsideration of  which might conveniently be under-token while the Sub-Committee of Nine was en-gaged in its deliberations, and that this considera-tion could most conveniently be carried on bygroups  consisting of members of the Grand Com-mittee  with  the addition of  certain other  mem-bers of the Convention.  These groups were  sub-sequently constituted into  three Sub-Committeeswith the following terms of  reference:    (1). To  consider  questions  of  franchise  and         electoral  systems  and  areas in relation         to an  Irish Parliament.   (2). To enquire  into the  problems presented by         land purchase in  Ireland.   (3). To consider (a)  what powers  of local de-         fence  might  be delegated to an  Irish         Government  consistently  with the re-         quirements of Imperial defence; (b) the         future  of the  Royal Irish Constabulary         and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.   The  Sub-Committee  of Nine  appointed onOctober 11th held a large number of meetings and subtnitted to us two reports dated November 15th and November 21st which have since beenreceiving our detailed  consideration.  The  Sub- Committee  were  able  to  arrive at certain  pro- visional conclusions on a considerable number of questions.   They  did not, however, succeed in reaching an  agreement upon  all matters, and it was  definitely  understood that the provisional conclusions were  not  to be  regarded as binding &quot; unless  an  agreement  should  ultimately be reached upon a general scheme.&quot;  The most im-portant question upon which agreement was notround possible in the Sub-Committee was that ofthe financial powers to  be entrusted to an IrishParliament.  We  submit for the consideration of the Con-vention a statement (I. C. No. 20)* showing theposition which we have reached up to the presenton the whole reference.  We desire to emphasisethe fact already indicated that in every case ourprovisional  conclusions  are  dependent  upon  ageneral agreement  being  ultimately reached  onthe important question  which still divides us.  The Sub-Committee considered proposals sub-mitted by the Bishop of Raphoe, which gave toan  Irish  Parliament complete  control over  allforms  of taxation.  The Unionist representativeswere  unable to accept  these proposals and theUlster Unionists desired that the complete fiscalunity  of the United Kingdom should be  main-tained and that all powers of taxation should con-tinue to rest, as at present, with the Parliamentof the United Kingdom.  Much of our time andthought has been occupied  in an endeavour tofind a  compromise  between these two  extremepositions,  and  the most  recent  proposal  whichhas  engaged our attention  is one submitted  byLord  Midleton  on  behalf   of  the   SouthernUnionists  which would  leave the imposition andcollection of customs duties to the Parliament ofthe United Kingdom and  make the receipts fromthis source of revenue the Irish contribution  to-wards the cost of Imperial services.   The mainfeatures of this proposal are  set-out in the docu-ment  marked I. C.  No. 21  which is being circu-lated to the  Convention.!  We submit to the Convention  for  their con-sideration  the  report of the Sub-Committee  onelectoral systems, and  it  will  be seen from thestatement of our provisional conclusions  that  wehave,  to a large extent,  accepted their  recom-mendations.  We also submit to the Convention the very im-portant  report of the  Sub-Committee on landpurchase.  We have not  been able  to give thisreport  the detailed consideration which it de-serves, but we are able to  state that  we are inagreement with the principles  underlying it.  The Sub-Committee on defence has not beenable to complete its deliberations, in the absenceof information which is  being sought from theAdmiraltv and the War Office.  We therefore  re-commend  that consideration  of  this questionshould be deferred  until  the Sub-Committee isable to report.  We are of opinion that the Convention can use-fully consider how far it is able to concur in theprovisional conclusions  which we  have recordedand  the  recommendations  contained  in  theseveral reports which we  have submitted to it.* See Appendix V.t See Appendix VI.

274  We,  the  Sub-Committee  appointed  by  theGrand Committee of the  Irish  Convention,  on1st November, 1917,  &quot; to inquire into the prob-lems presented by land purchase in Ireland &quot; held-thirteen sittings to examine the problems referredto us.  In the course  of our proceedings we havehad the  advantage of ascertaining the views ofSir Henry  Doran, of  the  Congested  DistrictsBoard, and the Rt. Hon. F. S.  Wrench and Mr.W. H. Stuart, Estates Commissioners, &quot;on certainpoints.  On the 4th December we signed a report whichwas duly presented to the Grand Committee andsubsequently  brought  before  the  Convention.This report was discussed by  the Convention onthe 8th,  9th,  and 10th January,  1918, and wasreferred back to the Sub-Committee with the  re-quest that  we  should  consider certain amend-ments.   We did so on the loth, 16th,  and 23rdJanuary,  and  unanimously  recommended  theadoption of  certain amendments which we haveincorporated in  the following Report which  wenow have the  honour  of presenting:      Assumption underlying  deliberations.  1.  We have proceeded on the assumption thatthe duty  laid upon us was to inquire into the prob-lems presented by land purchase, not under theexisting  form  of government  but  as part  of alarge  scheme  for  re-casting the  framework ofgovernment  in Ireland.  Accordingly, we have inour deliberations assumed  that an Irish  Parlia-ment,  with  an  Irish   Executive  responsiblethereto, is to be set up by an Act passed by theParliament of  the United Kingdom of Great Bri-tain  and Ireland,  and that an  Irish Exchequerand  an Irish  Consolidated  Fund,  distinct  fromthe present Exchequer and Consolidated Fund ofGreat Britain and  Ireland, are  to be  similarlyestablished.   We desire to  offer no  opinion,  inthis Report, as to the desirability of this change,but we wish to make it quite clear that our  re-commendations are based on the  assumption men-tioned and cannot be taken as agreed to on anyother hypothesis.          Problems to be considered.  2.  The problems  we  have considered may  begrouped under three main heads:       I.  Those connected with land which is the          subject of  completed sales under the          Land Purchase Acts.     H.  Those connected with land which is the          subject of  pending  proceedings under          these Acts.    III.  Those connected with  land which has          not as yet been the  subject of proceed-          ings under  these Acts.  The following table gives particulars of the land(I.) already sold,  (II.) agreed  to  be sold, and(III.) not made the  subject  of  proceedings forsale up to the 31st March last:                         Area   Poor Law   Purchase         No. of Holdings.

(see pp.      .)              I. Completed Sales.   3. The problems presented by land already sold are confined to  three main  points, (1) the collec- tion of the purchase  annuities and  the  hability for loss caused by default in payment thereof, (2) the liability for excess stock and bonus,  and (3) the  powers  exercisable  over  tenant purchasers and their holdings.  Similar points will  arise in respect of land  the subject of  pending cases  and in respect of land not yet the subject of  sale proceedings  as  soon as such  land is vested, in tenant purchasers;  and  the  recommendations made  below  apply to the latter as  well as to the former.             Collection of Annuities.   4. The existing arrangements for the collection of purchase annuities and for meeting loss caused by default in payment, as  well as the  arrange- ments  proposed under the Home Rule Bill of 1893 and the Government of Ireland  Act of 1914, are fully explained  in  Schedule II.  (See  pp.     .)   We are of opinion  that the arrangements suggested in the  above mentioned measures for making the Irish Consolidated Fund liable for any loss caused by  non-payment of annuities (which at  present  falls,   for the  most part,  on Irish funds), were sound (see Schedule II., paragraphs 12 and  13),  but that  the  arrangements  for treating the collection  of  annuities  as  a &quot; re- served &quot; service (see Schedule II., paragraph 14, p.  ) are no longer desirable.  We are of opinion that the Government that  is responsible for  any loss caused  by the  non-payment  of annuities should be charged with  the collection of these annuities.   (See paragraphs 40-1  and Schedule II., p.   .)   We therefore recommend  that all purchase annuities should  be  collected by a de- partment of the Irish Government, that the an- nuities should be paid into the Irish Consolidated Fund, that the  full amount collectible should be paid over to the Consolidated Fund of Great Bri-. tain and Ireland  on  fixed  dates, and that such payment should be  a  first  charge on the Irish Consolidated  Fund.   It  would,  of course be within  the discretion of the Irish Parliament to continue the present  process of making the funds of each county liable for all  loss caused by default within that county (see Schedule II., paragraph 10, p.    ).  We consider that  the cost of collec- tion of these annuities should be  regarded as Im- perial  expenditure and therefore treated  as  ex- plained in the next paragraph.  Possibly it would conduce to economical administration  and  ob- viate friction if this expenditure were  limited to a percentage on the amount  collectible.           Excess Stock and Bonus.   5. The liability for excess stock and bonus is fully described in Schedule  III.  (See pp.     .) It is sufficient to say  here that  the liability in re- spect of sales completed on or  before the 31st March last now amounts to  753,00  per annum, payable until the capital charge is amortised.  Of this total,  160,000 is paid out  of the  vote for  the Ireland Development Grant, and   593,000  out of  the  Land  Commission  Vote.   We  are of opinion that this charge, like the cost of collection of purchase annuities, though incurred in respect of an Irish service, is clearly an Imperial obliga- tion.   While, therefore, we  recommend that this annual sum ought to be paid out of the Irish Con- solidated  Fund,  we  hold that Great Britain&apos;s share thereof, if not repaid to  the Irish Govern- ment,  should be reckoned as a payment pro tantoby Ireland of whatever contribution Ireland is tomake towards Imperial expenditure.REPORT  OF  SUB-COMMITTEE   ON   LAND   PURCHASE.
  , Powers exercisable over Tenant Purchasers.  6. Certain powers are, in most cases, at pre-sent possessed over holdings  bought under theLand Purchase Acts,  during the continuance ofthe liability for the payment of purchase annui-ties, viz:   (a) The permission of the Land Commission is        required  for  sub-division or sub-letting        of  such  holdings  (see  section 54  of        Irish Land Act, 1903.)  (b) The permission of the Land Commission is        required  for   the  mortgaging  of  such         holdings  beyond  a  certain limit  (ten        times  the  amount  of  the  purchase         annuity,  see section 54 (8)  of Irish Land         Act,  1903, as amended  by section 2 of         Irish Land Act, 1907).  (c) The permission of the Land Commission is      &apos;   required  for  the  acquisition,  beyond a         certain limit, of holdings subject to land         purchase annuities (see  Irish Land Act,         1909, section  32 (1)).   (d) The Land Commission may prosecute ten-         ant purchasers for breach of regulations,         if  any,  as to turbary on  holdings  (see         section 21 of Irish Land Act, 1903), and         may  also  prosecute  tenant purchasers         who cut  certain  timber (necessary  for         the ornament or  shelter  of  a holding)         without  the  permission of the Depart-         ment of  Agriculture  and  Technical  In-         struction  (see section   32  (2)  of  Irish         Land Act, 1909).   (e) The Land Commission has  power in certain         cases  to determine   disputes  between         tenant purchasers  and  others  (see sec-         tion 22 of Irish Land Act, 1903), and it         also  possesses certain powers in respect         of mineral rights  and,  in  certain cases,         in respect of sporting rights&apos; (see section         13 of  Irish Land  Act,  1903,  section  1         of Irish Land Act, 1907, and section 37         of Irish  Land  Act,  1909).   &quot;We are of  opinion that these powers  should in future be exercised by a department of the Irish Government.               II. Pending Cases.   7. The  special  problems connected  with land agreed to be sold but the sale  of  which has not yet been  completed  are mainly financial.  The purchase  money  in respect of the  100,000 hold- ings affected by pending agreements is just under 24  million pounds  of  which,  it  is  estimated, nearly 19 millions must be provided in cash and the balance in stock, partly in 2f per cent, stock but mainly in 3  per  cent, stock.  The raising of the cash by  either stock will  involve the issue of a  large amount of excess stock, the annual  cost of which and of the bonus.payable under the pre- sent law will amount, it is estimated, at present prices,  to  at least  580,000 a year.  (See Sche-- dule III., paragraphs 10-12, pp.  33-4.)   We are of opinion that all these pending cases must be com- pleted on the basis of the agreements  made and in accordance with the existing financial system of  land purchase.  We desire,  however, to bring to notice the case of landlords who agreed to sell  under the Act of 1909 (in accordance with which  payment is to be made in 3 per cent,  stock), but  whose sales have not yet been  completed.   The  total purchase monev in  these  cases amounts to  about  4,500,000.   At the time  when most of  these landlords  agreed to sell, the stock stood at  over 80, but, in consequence of the war,  and the  issue of Government Stocks bearing higher ratesof interest, this stock has fallen to under GO. Con-sequently those landlords who have not receivedpayment must suffer a heavy loss if they haveto sell stock at the present price in order to payoff charges.  The difficulty would,  we think,  befairly met by paying such  landlords so much ofthe purchase money at the actual market pricethat prevailed for the stock at the date the agree-ments to sell were signed,  as may be proved, tothe satisfaction of the Land Commission, to  berequired (over and above the cash bonus, wherethe landlord is absolute owner) to pay off chargeswhich existed at the date of the agreement to sell,and still exist.*  We recognise  that this recom-mendation will not help those landlords who havealready received payment  in depreciated stock,but we do not consider it practicable to make anyrecommendation respecting  sales already com-pleted.   We  are   of  opinion that the   inaugurationof  a new   system  of Irish Government  ren-ders  it  imperative that all pending  cases shouldbe speedily  completed. Accordingly,  we recom-mend that  the cash  required should be providedand the stock required issued within three years,at the outside, from  the date on which legislativeeffect  is given  to  our proposals, if they  beaccepted.    As the Land Commission have&apos; cer-tain discretionary powers in respect of these cases,we  are  of opinion  that  it should  remain a&quot; reserved &quot; service, so far as  its functions inrespect of  pending cases  are concerned, on  theunderstanding that these cases will be completedwithin  the  time  mentioned.   The  recommendations made  in paragraphs 4,5, and 6 above in respect  of completed  sales, asregards the collection of purchase annuities  and the cost thereof, the liability for the loss caused&quot; by default in payment of annuities, the annual charge for  excess stock and  bonus, and the exer- cise  of powers over  tenant purchasers, all apply to pending  sales as  soon as  they are  completed.  III. Land unaffected by  Land Purchase Acts.                 Size of problem.   8.  The land not vet affected by the Land Pur- chase  Acts comprises  between  one-quarter  and one-third of the  total agricultural area of Ireland and  its valuation  is over one-third  of the valua- tion  of the agricultural area  of Ireland.   For  rea- sons explained in Schedule  I.  (see pp.  22-5), it is not easy to state precisely the number of hold- ings which are contained in this large  quantity of land.  On  the basis  of the  statistics  of  holdings issued by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and Technical Instruction, which seem to  he  the  best basis available,  it would appear that the number of these holdings do not  greatly exceed 60,000, or one-seventh of  the number of holdings already affected  by the Land  Purchase Acts.  The  dis- parity between the ratio that the number of hold- ings which have passed or  are passing  under these Acts bears  to the number of holdings which are as yet unaffected by them (7 to 1), and the ratio which the  area of the land affected  by these Acts * This suggestion may be illustrated by the case of a  land- lord who agreed to sell for  10,000 to be paid in .3 per cent  stock,  the charges  on  whose  estate amounted to   3,000.  If at the time he agreed to sell the stock  stood  at 80.  he would have had to sell   3.750  stock at that price in order to  redeem  these  charges.  If by the time  the purchase money is  paid over the stock has fallen to  60, the landlord would have  to sell  5.000 of stock in  order to pay off charges.  Under the above suggestion the  landlord would receive additional  stock to the amount  necessary ( 1,250) to  meet the  loss caused bv the  delay  in payment.  The balance in stock ( 6,250)&quot; left to the  landlord after the payment  of  charges, and  the income  therefrom ( 187 10s. 0d.). would not be directly affected  by the fall in the price of stock.
bears to the area  unaffected by them  (less  thanii to 1)  is due to the fact that a disproportionatenumber of the larger tenanted holdings  and of thelarge holdings of untenanted land remain unsold.*The smaller  tenanted holdings (i.e. the holdingsthe price  of which would not exceed the presentstatutory  limitations on the amount of  advances)probably number about 50,000 and constitute themost urgent problem which called for our  con-sideration.  It is  difficult,  however, as will  beseen later, to divorce their consideration from thatof the larger holdings, and the final settlement ofthe tenanted land of Ireland is intimately  con-nected with  the question  of  untenanted  land,especially in the  area  under the  control of theCongested Districts Board and outside that  areain connection with congested estates. Desirability of the speedy completion of Land                  Purchase.  9. We are of opinion that the conversion of thetenants  of the smaller  holdings into tenant  pur-chasers  is inevitable  under any form of  Govern-ment, due regard  being had to the relief of  con-gestion and the extension of tillage; and that anychange,  such as has been assumed above, in theframe of  Irish  Government would make it  emi-nently desirable that such conversion should, inthe  interests of  landlords,  tenants,   and   theGovernment  alike, be speedily effected.  We re-cognise, however,  that  such a  conversion cannotin many cases be immediate having regard to thefact that  many  of the existing holdings requireenlargement  or  other improvement  before  theyare vested in their occupiers.   We further recog-nise that  such a  conversion  cannot,  under theexisting law, be universal,  since  the limitationson  the  amount  of advances . prevent the largertenanted holdings passing from landlord to tenantunder the present  Land Purchase Acts.f  We areof opinion, however,  that it would be  unreason-able to  ask  landlords after  they had disposed ofthe greater  part of  their tenanted land to  con-tinue as landlords of a few isolated large hold-ings.  We are further of opinion that with a  radi-cal change in the form of Irish Government, thecompletion of land purchase cannot be  left to thecomparatively slow method of bargaining betweenlandlord and tenant  nor be subjected to amend-ing legislation by either the Imperial or the  IrishParliament.    As  regards  untenanted  land, wreconsider an  immediate and universal transfer ne-cessary  within the area over which the  CongestedDistricts Board operates (all Connaught, Donegaland Kerry and part of Clare and  Cork) in orderto  enable that Board  to  discharge  its  primaryfunction.  On the  other hand, we do not think awholesale transference of the  untenanted  landelsewhere to be practicable.  * By untenanted land is meant land in which no tenancyhas been created and where therefore the owner in  fee isalso the  rated  occupier.  Such land does not cease  to beuntenanted by reason of being temporarily let, e.g., on theeleven months&apos; system.   Land bought  under the  LandPurchase Acts  and land held under fee-farm grants of anydata is excluded from this classification.  tThe main  limitation  is that in the case of a tenancycreated after 1st January, 1901,,the advance shall not ex-ceed  500 (subject to the exception mentioned in Sect. 53of the Act of 1903),  and that in the case of other ten-ancies the advance shall not exceed  3,000, though it iswithin the  discretion  of the Land Commission to make anadvance  not exceeding   5,000, provided the holding isresidential.  No advance can be made  in the case of atenancy created after the  15th September, 1909, exceptwhere the  tenancy was  created by either the CongestedDistricts Board or the  Estates Commissioners.            Main  Recommendations.  10. Accordingly,, we recommend (a)  that thelandlord s interest in  all tenanted land, not ex-cepted below (see  paragraph 12), should be auto-matically transferred  either to  the  occupyingtenants, or  to  the State,  as represented  by theCongested Districts Board or the  Estates Com-missioners,  for resettlement;  (b)  that  all un-tenanted land  within the Board&apos;s area  not ex-cepted below (see paragraphs 22 and 23)  shouldbe automatically  transferred from the owner tothe Board for the same purpose; and (c) that out-side the Board*s area the existing powers of theEstates  Commissioners  to  acquire  untenantedland should be preserved and,  in one case, ex-tended. Change to  be  effected by Imperial Legislation.  11. These changes  should be effected  by  anAct Of the Imperial Parliament,  to  be passed con-currently with  a Government of Ireland Act, butthe automatic transfer of land should not operateuntil &quot; the appointed day,&quot; which should be fixedby the  Lord Lieutenant  in  Council.  This date,however,  should not  be  more  than three yearsafter the passing of the Act.   Power should be re-served to the Lord Lieutenant in Council of fixingdifferent days for  different districts and possiblyfor different purposes.  This postponement of theappointed day  will  provide  an  interval  duringwhich  sales may  be  effected by  agreement be-tween landlords and tenants, but the provision ofthis  interval is suggested  mainly  because - theBoard and the Estates Commissioners will  requiretime to  prepare for the working of the scheme andbecause the Estates Commissioners will be oecu-pied for three years in clearing off  pending cases.  The  details  of  the  scheme can  be most con-veniently considered under two headings (1) Ten-anted Land, (2) Untenanted Land.             TENANTED LAND,               Scope  of  Change.  12. We are of opinion that the proposed auto-matic transfer of  all tenanted land should, notapply  to townparks, non-agricultural holdings,holdings the main object of the letting of whichwas for a residence, nor to any land which, havingregard to its propinquity to a town, possesses, inthe opinion of the Board  or the  Estates Com-missioners,  a  substantial  potential or  actualvalue or utility as building ground.  An  appealshould  lie from the Board or the  Estates Com-missioners to the  Judicial  Commissioner  on thequestion  whether  any  land comes  within  theabove-mentioned  exceptions.  It  would,  bow-ever, be desirable  to provide that where an estateincludes both agricultural holdings and non-agri-cultural holdings,  the latter may,  if the landlordso desires, and if  the Congested Districts Boardor the Estates  Commissioners approve, be  sold tothe tenants at  the same time as the agriculturalholdings.  As  we have indicated,  we  are  ofopinion that from  the passing of the Act until theappointed day  sales may continue to be effectedby agreement between landlords and tenants, orbetweqn landlords and the Congested  DistrictsBoard or the Estates Commissioners, on the basisof the  financial  arrangements  proposed  later;but we hold that, from the passing  of the Act, alljudicial revision of rents should  cease, except forthe purpose of  converting non-judicial rents intoa basis  for  purchase,  as  explained in paragraph29.   We recommend that the Act should throwupon landlords  the duty of lodging  before the ap-M
 pointed day copies of such documents (schedules of tenancies, copies of rentals, maps, &amp;c.) as may be required in statutory rules to be made under the Act.   In connection  with this and similar duties cast upon landlords by the scheme  (see paragraphs 23 and 29) we are of opinion that sec- tion 23, sub-sections  (11) and (12)  of the Act of 1903  should apply mutatis  mutandis  to sales under the new Act.             Position of Landlords.   13.  We recommend, as regards rent and interest in lieu  thereof,  (1)  that  the  landlords  right to rent and arrears of rent should continue unaffected by the passing of the Act until the appointed day; (2) that on the appointed day the landlord should eease  to be entitled to rent not already  accrued, but that his right to sue for and recover all  rent which had accrued between the gale day  immedi- ately  prior to the passing of the Act and the gale day immediately prior to the appointed day should be preserved; (3) that he should be entitled to re- ceive  from the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board, as from the gale day immediately prior  to the appointed, day, the interest on the purchase  money (settled as explained below, see paragraph 31),  and, where the purchase, money and bonus have not been paid within one year from  the  gale day  immediately prior  to the ap- pointed day, the landlord should be also paid, as from  one  year after that gale day until  the  pur- chase money and bonus be paid, interest at 5 per cent,  on the amount of the bonus to which the landlord will be entitled.   14.  The interest of all  chargeants  should, as from  the  appointed days be transferred from the landlords interest  in  the  land  to the  pur- chase   money  and  to  the  interest  payable thereon.   The  corpus  of the  purchase money should  be distributed  and the  bonus  paid as soon  as  the  landlord  has  finally cleared his title  and  the final schedule  of - incumbrancers has been  settled as at  present.  &apos;  The  trans- ference of the landlords interest  in  all his  ten- anted holdings from the  land  to  the purchase money should be final as from the appointed  day, that is to  say, the landlord should not be affected by  any decision  the Estates Commissioners or the Congested Districts Board may  hereafter arrive at not to vest any of these holdings in the tenants, in accordance  with the discretion given to these bodies, as explained below.   (See para- graphs 17-20.)              Position of Tenants.   15.  The position  of tenants under  the scheme suggested  can be most conveniently  considered under two heads, (I.) tenants in the  area within the control of the Congested Districts Board and (II) tenants elsewhere. I. In  the  area under the control of the Congested                Districts Board.   16.  We recommend that on the appointed day all the  interest of the  landlords in all tenanted holdings,  not specially  excepted (see paragraph 12), within the Congested Districts Board&apos;s area, should pass to the Board and that the tenants. thereof  should be liable  to the Board,  as from the last preceding gale day, for their  existing rents, subject  to such reduction as the Board may deem&quot;it desirable to grant.       (a) Holdings passed for  vesting.  17. We are of opinion that the  Board should asspeedily  as possible pass for vesting by the LandCommission all holdings the purchase money forwhich  would not exceed the  present limitationson  the amount of advances, provided that theBoard did not  consider that any of the holdingsin question should be retained for enlargement, orother  improvement,  or for  utilisation in con-nection with the relief of congestion.  The annui-ties to be payable by the tenant purchasers of theholdings thus passed for vesting should be suchproportion of their former  rents as is determinedby  the  appropriate  county percentage,  as ex-plained below.   (See  paragraphs 27-29.)      (b) Holdings not passed for vesting.  18. Over the holdings not thus passed for vest-ing, the Board should possess all  powers neces-sary  for resettlement including  the  powerspossessed by the former  landlords, the  specialpowers now possessed by the Board over  tenantson estates purchased by the Board, and such otherpowers as may be deemed necessary, includingthe  power of  continuing tenants as tenants, ofacquiring the  tenant&apos;s interest in the whole orpart of any holding  on the payment pf full com-pensation, and of declaring the tenant of anyholding the tenant purchaser of  his own  holdingor  of an alternative holding (whether larger orsmaller) at what the Board consider a  fair price.We recommend that sales by the  Board to ten-ants should be subject to  the present  limitationof  3,000 on the amount of advances but not tothe other restrictions mentioned in the footnoteto page  55.  In order, however, to conserve forthe relief of  congestion,   land  at present un-tenanted, we  are  of opinion that no tenancycreated  in such  land  after 1st  January,  1918,should operate so as to prevent *he  CongestedDistricts  Board from acquiring,   ;s  untenantedland (see paragraph  23), the land  comprised insuch tenancy.  Where the Board in consequenceof the limitation of  3,000 sells to a tenant partonly of his holding the Board should, as in othercases of the  acquisition of the tenanfs interest,pay full compensation to such tenant for the partof his holding retained by  the Board.II.  Outside the area under  the control of the Con-            gested Districts Board.             (a)  Smaller holdings.  19. ,We recommend that, in the area  not underthe control of the  Congested Districts  Board,  alltenants of holdings  not specially  excepted (seeparagraph 12), the  purchase  money  for  whichwould not exceed the present limitations upon theamount of advances should, on the appointed day,become provisional tenant purchasers; and shouldautomatically  cease  to  be liable  for  rent notalready accrued,  and should  become  liable, forpayment to the Land Commission, as  from thelast gale  day, of a purchase annuity to be fixed inaccordance with the  scheme  set out below (seeparagraphs 27-29).  On a  day to be specified instatutory rules made under  the Act,  all  suchprovisional tenant purchasers should become,  a?from  the appointed  day,  tenant purchasers  oftheir holdings,  unless the Estate Commissionershad already declared it undesirable  for any par-ticular provisional tenant purchaser to become thetenant purchaser of  his existing  holding,  on theground that such holding was so  &quot; uneconomic &apos;as to render improvement,  where  possible, essen-tial, or on the  ground that for- any  other reason
the holding could-not be vested in the occupierwith advantage to the State.   Over holdings  soexcepted the Estates Commissioners should pos-sess powers similar to those mentioned above  aspossessed by or to be given  to the Congested Dis-trictS: Board over  their tenants  (see  paragraph18).   The Estates Commissioners  could conse:quehtly acquire such a holding on the payment offull compensation;  or could continue  the tenantof such a holding  as tenant of that holding;  orcould declare  him  the  tenant purchaser of hisholding, as it exists or enlarged or otherwise im-proved, or of an alternative holding, at what theyconsidered a fair price.             (b)  Larger holdings.  20. We recommend that, on the appointed day,the landlord&apos;s interest in all holdings, not speciallyexcepted (see paragraph 12), the purchase moneyof which would exceed the  present limitations  onthe amount of the advances, should automaticallypass to the Estates Commissioners, and that thetenants of such holdings should, as from the galeday immediately prior  to the appointed day, be-come liable for the  payment to the Land Commis-sion of their existing rents subject to such re-duction,  if any, as the  Estates Commissionersmay deem it   advisable to make.   We  are  ofopinion that the Commissioners in dealing withthese larger holdings should have regard to therelief of congestion, the desirability of increasingthe food supphy of  the country, and the use madein this respect  of  such  holdings by the tenants.We therefore recommend that the Estates Com-missioners should  be  empowered,  having regardto the  matters mentioned  above, to acquire thetenanfs interest in any of the  said holdings  orany  part thereof;  or to-continue the  tenants  astenants thereof; or to sell  to them the whole orpart of their holdings  notwithstanding the fac^that such sales might be contrary to the existingrestrictions or limitations on advances.   Wherethe whole or any  part  of  such  a holding is ac-quired by the  Estates Commissioners  full  com-pensation should be paid to the tenant.   We  are of opinion that  no  advance should  bemade for the sale of a holding where the tenancyMas created after  1st January,  1918,  unless theEstates  Commissioners certify that the creationof the  tenancy was in accordance with  the  in-terests of the country.Special Powers for Congested Districts Board and            Estates Commissioners.   21.  In order to  enable the Congested Districts Board and  the Estates Commissioners to  carrythrough sales in  the manner proposed, we con-sider that they should be given full powers to dealwith such questions as boundaries, turbary (dueregard being  paid to the  requirements of theowner and his  employees), provision of access toturbary and holdings, provision for the future up-keep and repair of embankments and cleaning ofstreams with power, where necessary,  to establisha maintenance rate chargeable on the lands trans-ferred, amalgamation  of small holdings,  vesting and registration of holdings of deceased tenants, and such other powers as may be necessary.            UNTENANTED LAND.          Demesnes and Home Farms.   22.  We recommend that demesnes and home farms   should  not be  interfered  with  by  the scheme we are proposing, and that  the  presentrights of the owner to purchase such land underthe Land Purchase Acts  should be . preserved, payment to be made in 5 per cent, stock as pro-posed hereafter (see paragraph 26).  We are alsoof opinion that  the  Irish Parliament  should  beprecluded for a term of twenty years from legis-lating in respect of such land. Other untenanted land within the Board&apos;s area.  23. As regards untenanted land other than de-mesnes, home farms, townparks, and plantations,we are of opinion, in view of the necessity of ac-quiring such land for the relief of congestion, thatall  such land within the Board&apos;s area  should, onthe appointed day, pass automatically from theowner to the  Congested Districts Board,  whichwould thus acquire the landlords&apos; interest  in thewhole  of their estates with the exception  of de-mesnes,  home farms,  plantations and the hold-ings specially excepted  in  paragraph 12.   Werecommend that the owner should have the privi-lege, if he so desired, of retaining sporting rightsover untenanted land thus sold, and that certainsmall areas (such as herds&apos; gardens, gamekeepers&apos;cottages, quarries and gravel pits required in con-nection with the demesnes and home farms, &amp;c.)may be excluded from the sale by agreement be-tween the owner  and the  Congested DistrictsBoard.   For the  purpose  of settling  the  price,under  the plan  proposed below  (see paragraphs35-6),  of  the untenanted land to  be transferred,we recommend that all owneis of land within theBoard&apos;s area (other than land  bought under theLand Purchase Acts) should be  required to lodgewith the Board, within a certain period after thepassing of the Act (to be fixed by the Land Corn-mission in statutory rules), a schedule and mapof all their untenanted land not  excepted above.Other untenanted land outside the Board&apos;s area.  24. As regards untenanted  land outside  theBoard&apos;s  area, we are of opinion that it  is notpracticable to provide that this untenanted landshould automatically pass from  the  owner  on theappointed day; but we recommend  that the pre-sent  powers of  the  Estates Commissioners  toacquire untenanted land should be preserved, in- cluding  their  present  powers  of compulsory acquisition; and that  the powers of the Estates- Commissioners  to acquire  untenanted  land  by voluntary agreement  with  the  owner should be extended to include the acquisition of such land (a) for resettlement in order to  increase the food production of the country, and  (b) on behalf of the Congested Districts Board, in connection with the relief  of congestion within the  Board&apos;s area. It  might  facilitate both  the  Estates Commis- sioners and the Board in relieving congestion if they were given power to exchange  land inter se. We&quot; further recommend that where the tenantedportion of an estate  includes congested holdings and there is on the same estate untenanted land, the Estates Commissioners should be  empowered to acquire by compulsion, if necessary,  so much of  such landas may be required for relieving the congestion on the estate.   The price  to be paid by  the  Estates  Commissioners  for  such land should be fixed in the same way as the price of untenanted land within the Congested Districts Board&apos;s area is to be  fixed (see pars.  35-6), that is, failing agreement between the owner and theEstates  Commissioners,  by the  Judicial Com-missioners, who  in fixing the price should haveregard to the fair value of the land to the ownerand to the Estates Commissioners.  We  are  ofopinion  that  the  exercise  of  the compulsorypowers possessed  by the Estates Commissionersshould,  except  in the  special case  mentionedabove, be governed by the  existing provisions cfthe Act  of 1909.                                     M2
 Financial  Basis of  Sales under the New Act.  25. We have  considered the financial basis  ofthe Act of 1903 and of the Act of 1909 (see Sche-dule IV., pp.     ),  and we do not consider thateither basis would, under the present conditionsof the money market, be suitable for future sales.To revert to the basis of the Act of 1903, paymentin cash raised by the issue, of 2f per cent, stock,would at present prices involve the State becom-ing responsible for  85 of excess stock for every 100 of agreed purchase money. On the other handwe do  not  think it would be fair to propose thatour plan for the completion of land purchase shouldbe carried through on the basis of the Act of 1909under which a landlord, for every  100 of agreedpurchase money, receives  100 3 per cent,  stock-which  at the present price is  worth only   59-60.We  have considered various proposals which havebeen made from time  to time (see pp. 35-9), andare  of opinion that  the  most hopeful solution ispayment in 5 per cent, stock at face value (see p.38.)  This  would involve the raising of the rateof  purchase annuities  to  5J  per  cent.  Fiveshillings paid  in  two equal half-yearly  instal-.ments,  if uniformly invested  at 5 per cent., willsecure  the amortisation of   100  stock in  62years.   An investment of the sinking fund at auniform rate of 5 per cent, might be secured  bypower  being taken  to redeem at par each  halfyear an amount of 5 per cent, stock equal to theamount of the sinking fund payment,  the  stockso redeemable  to  be  determined  by periodicaldrawings. Payment  in 5  per  cent. Stock Recommended.   26. Accordingly we recommend that the  pur-chase money of all land to be sold, after the pass-ing  of a new Land  Purchase Act, whether as aresult of voluntary agreement or by means of theautomatic  process which we propose should comeinto force on the appointed day, for all tenantedland and all untenanted land within the  Board&apos;sarea, should be paid in 5 per cent,  stock at facevalue.  We are of opinion that the new 5 per cent.stock should be issued, and payment thereon guar-anteed, by the Imperial Government, in the sameway as guaranteed 2f per cent,  stock and 3 percent, stock have been  issued  and  guaranteed.The liability thus  imposed  upon the ImperialExchequer  will  be  purely  nominal,  as is   itspresent  liability  in  respect of  the  stocks  men-tioned  above,   since  payments  in respect  ofinterest and sinking  fund  should  form a  firstcharge  upon the Irish Consolidated Fund.    Asis pointed  out in Schedule II. (paragraphs 6-11,pp.  27-8),  the  loss  caused  to the State by thenon-payment of  purchasers&apos;  annuities has beenpractically  negligible,  but  that  loss,  whateverit may  be in  the  future,  should  be  boriie  byIrish funds as  it is at present. Automatic fixation of  annuities and purchase            money of tenanted  land.   27. We  are of opinion that the proposed auto-matic   transfer  of  all  tenanted  land  on theappointed  day  necessitates  the adoption of  anautomatic  method,  which is  explained below, offixing,  first, the annuities payable by all tenantpurchasers whose  holdings are  vested  in  them without alteration  by  the  Congested  Districts Board  or the Estates Commissioners (see para- graphs 28-9), and secondly,  the purchase money of all tenanted land  (see paragraph 31).  AUTOMATIC  FIXING  OF PURCHASE                ANNUITIES.              1. Judicial Rents.  28. We are of  opinion that, in  the  case  ofjudicial rents, the best automatic basis is to fixthe tenant purchaser^ annuity at the same pro-portion of his existing rent  as  the  annuities  ofprevious tenant purchasers  of the  same classformed of their  rents.  We  consider that varia-tions in local circumstances can be most fairlvmet by applying to each case the average reduc-tion in the  annuity as compared with the rentnot for all Ireland, but for  the county in whicheach  holding is  situate.    We feel ourselvesdebarred from taking  as the standard a  smallerunit than the county,  partly because the countyis the  smallest area for which statistics  areavailable, but mainly because  an  average iu  atransaction  of  this  nature  can be  regarded  asfair  only when  it is the result of  a  large bulkof transactions.  For the latter reason, we havepreferred to rely on sales under the Act of 1903rather than  on sales under the Act  of 1909, andto confine our attention to  such  sales as camewithin the zones.  After  this general  explanation,  we can nowstate our specific recommendations as  to eachclass of judicial rents.  (a)        &quot; First Term &quot; Rents.      Each  tenant  whose rent payable  at  the         date of the passing  of the Act had been         fixed before 14th August,  1896, should         pay as an annuity such proportion of that         rent as former tenant purchasers, in his         county, who-bought under the  Act  of         1903 (on  the  basis  of rents fixed before         14th August, 1896,  at prices which came         within  the zones) on the average, paid         of  their rents as annuities..  This pro-         portion for each county is given in Table         I.  of Schedule V.  (p. 41).    It  is sufh-         cient to -note  here  that it  varied from         74.5  per cent, in   Kildare  to  66.3 per         cent, in  Clare  and  Kerry.  The  total         transactions on which  these  figures are         based  affected  over  32,000   tenants         whose  purchase  money  exceeded  13         million pounds.  So far as we  can as-         certain  the number of tenants  as  yet         unaffected by the Land Purchase Acts,         who  are  subject to rents  fixed  before         14th August,  1896,  commonly  called          first  term &quot; rents, is not large.  (b)       &quot; Second Term  &quot; Rents.      Each  tenant  whose rent payable  at  the         date of the passing  of the Act had been         fixed after  14th  August,  1896,  and be-         fore 14th August,  1911,  should  pay  as         an  annuity such proportion of that rent         as  former  tenant  purchasers,   in  his         county, who  bought under the  Act  of         1903 (on  the basis  of rents fixed since         14th August, 1896,  at prices which came         within  the  zones) on the average, paid         of  their rents as annuities.  This pro-         portion for each countv is given in Table         II. of Schedule V.  (p. 42).  It is suffi-         cient to note  here  that it varied from         83&apos;6 per  cent,  in Londonderry to 74&apos;5         per cent, in Cork and Clare.  The total         transactions on wdiich  these  figures are         based  affected  over  60,000   tenants         whose  purchase  money  exceeded  22         million  pounds.   So  far  as  we can
   ascertain,  most  of  the tenants as yet   unaffected by  the  Land Purchase Acts   are  subject to rents fixed in the period   14th August, 1896-14th August,  1911,   commonly called &quot;second term&quot; rents.      &quot; Third Term &quot; Rents.The case of rents fixed since 14th August,   1911,  sometimes called &quot; third term &quot;   rents, is more difficult.   The number   of  tenants whose  rents  have been  re-   vised  in the  period 1st April,  1911-   31st March, 1917,  is as follows:                         No.      Average                        of    percentage of                      Cases.    reduction.fixed for a first term  4,644      ,,    second ,,   4,594           third      5,444Total14,682157135 9-212-6No statistics  are available  as  to  thereduction  obtained  on  purchase   bytenants  who  bought  on the  basis  ofrents fixed since 14th  August,  1911;but such statistics would not have beenvery  helpful,  since the  bulk of suchtransactions has certainly not been largeenough  to  make the average reductionobtained  a safe  guide.   We  are  ofopinion   that  the   reduction  in  rentobtained .by these  tenants, cannot  beignored that  is  to  say, their  purchaseannuities cannot be based on the rentspayable previous to this  revision.   Onthe other hand,  we do  not  think thatsuch  tenant purchasers  should  obtainon  purchase  such  a  large  reductionfrom their rents  fixed since 14th August,1911, as would,  under the scheme wepropose, be  obtained by tenant  pur-chasers  whose rents had  been  fixed be-fore that date.  To give  them the samereduction would mean that, as they arenow paying, or will be paying, from somedate  subsequent to the  14th August,1911, on the average, only 87-4 per cent.of the rents they had previously beenpaying,  they would  on purchase  pay asannuities only from 65-1 per cent,  (inCork  and Clare) to 73-1 per cent,  (inLondonderry)  of  their old rents.   Weare of opinion that tenants who havehad rents fixed since 14th August, 1911,should pay as annuities  a larger pro-portion  than  those mentioned  above.After careful  consideration  we  havedecided  to recommend  that  the  re-duction   to   be  obtained  by   suchtenants,   on  purchase,   from   theirexisting  rents  should be  only two-thirds  of the  reduction  obtained,  onpurchase, by  second  term tenants  intheir county.  The reduction that wouldunder this  proposal be obtained on pur-chase,  from  rents  fixed  since  14thAugust,  1911,  and  the  annuities thatwould.be payable are  shown,  for eachcounty,  in Table III.  of Schedule V.(p.  43). ^  The reduction  shown  above,as  obtained  from  rent  revision  since1811 viz., 126 per cent. is,  however,only  an average,  and  the  reductionsobtained in different cases showed con-siderable variation.   Consequently, weconsider that it would be well to providethat the annuity to be paid by a tenantpurchaser whose rent  has been revisedsince 1911  should in no  case be greaterthan that payable by a tenant purchaserwhose rent  had not been  revised since1911  (though  it had been  revised since1896) and whose rent was  equal to thatpayable before  1911  by a tenant pur-chaser who had  obtained  a  subsequentrevision.  This provision will safeguarda purchaser, who has had his rent re-vised since  1911, from paying a  largerannuity than he would have  had to payhad his rent not  been so  revised.             2. Non-judicial Rents.   29.  Though  statistics are available  as  to the average reduction obtained by non-judicial tenants in each county who bought  under the  Act of 1903,  we do not think that these averages would, owing to  the  great variations in  non-judicial rents, be a  satisfactory basis for  the  automatic fixation  of  purchase annuities.  We,  therefore, recommend  that it  should  be the duty  of the Land  Commission, between  the date of the pass- ing of an  Act  to  give effect  to  our proposals and the appointed  day, to  fix judicial rents on all tenanted holdings (other than those excepted in paragraph  12  above) not now  subject to judicial  rents;  and that each tenant  of  such a holding  should,  on  purchase, pay  as an annuity the same proportion of judicial rent, thus fixed, as judicial  tenants in his  county subject to rents fixed since 14th  August, 1911, are  to pay of  such rents under the foregoing provisions (see last para- graph, sub-head (c), and Table III.  of Schedule V., p. 43, col. 3).   To enable this  provision to be carried out, we  are of opinion  that all land- lords  should be  required  to furnish before  a certain date (to be  fixed by  Land  Commission rules)  a schedule  of all non-judicial  tenancies. An appeal  should lie,  as at present,  from  the Sub-Commission Court to  the Chief  Commission Court  at.the instance of either landlord  or tenant. In fixing a judicial rent for the purpose  of this paragraph due regard  should  be  paid  to   any reduction given by the landlord in the past.  It should be made  quite clear that the  tenant  con- tinues liable for  his old rent until  the  appointed day, and that  the judicial rent is  assessed  only as a  basis  for  the fixation  of  the  purchase annuity.   We  recognise  that special provision must  be made  to  meet  exceptional  cases,  such as  that of  some  fee-farm grantees and   certain  lease- holders,  where the  fixation of  a rent  on   the agricultural  value of the  land would  not form an equitable basis  for sale.   Accordingly,  we recommend that any party interested in a hold- ing subject  to  a non-judicial  rent should have the right of requiring the case of such  a holding to be transferred from the Sub-Commission Court to the Estates  Commissioners, who have specialfacilities for  dealing  with  the  exceptional cases indicated; and that they should fix a rent, as a basis for purchase, having regard to the interestsof all the parties concerned  and all the circum-stances of the  case.  An appeal should lie fromthe decision of  the Estates Commissioners  to theJudicial Commissioner.
Method of fixing Annuities on holdings  retained        -- by Board or Commissioners.  30. We  recommend  that all  tenants whoseholdings are not vested in them, but are  retainedfor  treatment  or  for any other reason by theCongested  Districts Board or the Estates Com-missioners,  should, wdien holdings  are vested inthem,  pay an  annuity of  o\ per cent, on  whatthe  Board or the Commissioners declare  to bethe  fah&apos; price  of the holding when vested.AUTOMATIC  FIXATION   OF   PURCHASE      MONEY OF  TENANTED  LAND.  31. We are of opinion that the purchase moneyto be received by landlords  for their tenantedland, whether such  land  is subsequently vestedin the tenants  without alteration  or not, shouldbe the  purchase  money  provided  by a  5J percent, annuity  equal in  amount  to  the  rentalreduced  by the  appropriate  county  percentagefor each class of rent,  as set out in paragraphs28 and 29.  The  amount  so provided  would varyper  100 of rental from  1,262 in the case most-unfavourable to  the landlord (a  &quot; first  term &quot;rental in Clare or Kerry) to  1,592 in the casemost favourable   to the  landlord (a  &quot; secondterm &quot;  rental  in Londonderry),  or  possibly to 1,697  (in the case of  a  &quot;third  term&quot;  rentalin Londonderry).*   Payment to be made in 5 per cent,  stock.  32. This purchase  money  should be paid aswe  have  already indicated (see &quot;paragraph  26),not  in cash, but  in  5 per cent,  stock at facevalue.   We recognise that in the  present  condi-tion of the money market this stock might standat   a slight  discount,  though the half-yearlyredemption at par of an amount of stock equal tothe  amount of the sinking fund, which we havesuggested  (see  paragraph  25),  might have  aslight effect in keeping up the price  of the  stock.We recommend that all charges due  to the  State,such as death duties, quit  and crown r*nts, etc.,should  be redeemable  by the  transfer of suchan  amount of  stock that the interest  therefromis equal to the amount of the charge, where suchcharge is an annual charge,  and by the transferof  stock  equal at  face value to the amount  ofthe  charge, where such charge is a capital charge.This provision should be  of some  assistance  tolandlords.  Thus, under this proposal, quit andcrown  rents  could be  redeemed at  20  years&apos;purchase instead of 25 years&apos; purchase,  as  atpresent.          Effect on Landlords Income. -33. We recognise, however,  that  the. annual income  available for the  landlord,  under  this scheme,  which might vary  from  63, 2s. per  100 of  gross  &quot;first term&quot;  rental  in  Clare  or Kerry to  79,  12s.  per  100 of gross  &quot; second-term &quot;  rental  in  Londonderry,  or  possiblv  to  84,  17s.  per   100  of  &quot;gross third term&quot; rental in Londonderry, would rarely  suffice  to yield 811 adequate income as compared with the landlord &apos;a net rental.* See Schedule V., col. 4 of Tables I. and II.. and col. 6       of Table III., and note to latter Table.     Bonus required-Scale recommended.  34.  Accordingly,  we recommend that a cashbonus should be payable on the purchase moneyof all tenanted land, varying, as does the bonusunder the  Act of 1909;  from 0 to 18 per cent.inversely with the number  of years&apos;  purchasethat  the   purchase money  represents of  therental.  The scale we recommend is  as follows:14^ years&apos; purchase and under  ...     ... 18 per cent.Over 14^ but not exceeding 15 years&apos; purchase, 16  ,,  jj 15   ,,          15I     ,,       14  ,,,,  15g,,  16,,  16I   17,,  17I15I1616 1717I181210 8 6 4Above 18 years&apos; purchase ...Nil.The scale is adopted to meet the special circuni-stances of  the  automatic process recommended,but it is substantially the  scale of the Act  of1909 adapted from a 3 per cent, basis to a 5 percent,  basis.  So far as we can calculate, it willaverage  15 per cent,  on  all tenanted  land  ascompared with the uniform bonus of 12 per cent.which was  paid in  all cases under the Act  of1903 and the variable bonus which  averaged justover 10  per cent,  under the Act of 1909.   Theeffect  of the  bonus,  assuming investment  at  5per cent., would be to raise the landlords incomeper  100 of gross rental, in the  most unfavour-able  case  mentioned  above,  from   63, 2s.  to 74,  10s.,  and in  the most favourable  case,from   79, 12s.  to   89, 2s., or  possibly,  to 91,  12s. in the case  of a &quot; third term &quot; rentalin Londonderry.    Illustrative figures for  eachcounty are given  in  the Tables  to Schedule  Y.(see pp.     ).   PURCHASE  MONEY  OF UNTENANTED  LAND.          1. Within the Board&apos;s area.  35.  We  have already recommended  (par. 23)that  all untenanted land,  not a  demesne, homefarm,  plantation,  or townpark, should, in viewof the necessity of acquiring  such land for therelief  of congestion,  pass automatically on theappointed day from the owner to the CongestedDistricts Board;  and, for the purpose of settlingthe  price,  we have  also recommended that  allowners  of  land within  the  Board&apos;s area  (otherthan tenants who  bought under the Land Pur-chase Acts) should be required to lodge with theBoard, within a certain period after the passingof the Act (to be  fixed by the Land Commissionin  statutory rules), a schedule  of  all their un-tenanted land other than that excepted  above. We now recommend  that the Board should,  as soon  as  possible  thereafter, inspect  all such land, and  make an offer to the owner, setting out the estimated annual value and the proposed price.   If the proposed price be accepted by  the owner,  interest at 5  per  cent, on the proposed price and  interest at 5 per  cent, on  the bonus payable thereon should be paid to the owner, as from the  appointed day, until the title is finally cleared and the final schedule of  incumbrancers settled.   36. If the  owner declines to accept the pro- posed price,  an appeal should lie to the Judicial Commissioner, who  in fixing the price  of  the land in question should have regard to the  fair value of the land to the  owner and to the Con- gested Districts Board.  Pending his  decision, a sum equal to the annual  value  as  determined by the Board,  plus 5 per  cent, on  the  bonus payable on the proposed  price, should be paid to  the owner as from the appointed day.  From
the date of the fixation of  price by the JudicialCommissioner until the date  when the purchasemoney is paid over, there  should be  payable tothe owner interest at  5  per  cent, on the pricefixed by the Judicial Commissioner -plus  interestat 5 per cent,  on the  bonus; and any differencebetween (a) the sum actually paid to the owneras from  the appointed day until the fixation ofprice;  and  (b)  interest at 5 per cent,  on  theprice  fixed  by. the  Judicial  Commissioner  plusinterest at 5 per cent,  on the bonus for the sameperiod (he., from the appointed day until  thefixation  of  the price) should  be added  to  ordeducted from  (as  the case may be) the  sumpayable  to the owner.          2.  Outside the Board&apos;s area.  37. As already mentioned  (par. 24) we do notconsider it practicable  to  propose that  unten-auted  land  outside  the  Board&apos;s  area  shouldautomatically  pass  from  the  landlord  on  theappointed  day; but we have recommended thatthe present powers of  the Estates Commissionersto acquire untenanted land should be preserved,including  their present  powers  of  compulsoryacquisition, and  that  the powers of the EstatesCommissioners  to  acquire  land  by  voluntaryagreement with the owners  should be  extendedfor certain purposes.  In voluntary.cases the priceshould   be   fixed by  agreement between  theEstates  Commissioners and  the owners,  and incompulsory cases by  the Judicial Commissionerunder the  existing  law, except in the  specialcase mentioned  in  paragraph 24, where unten-anted  land is acquired by  the  Estates Commis-sioners in order to relieve congestion on the sameestate.   In  such a  case, the Judicial  Commis-sioner  in  fixing  the  price,  failing agreementbetween  the owner  and the Estates  Commis-sioners,  is  to. have  regard to the fair value ofthe land  to  the  owner  and  to  the  EstatesCommissioners.     Scale of Bonus on all  untenanted land.   38. We recommend  that the  bonus to  bepayable  on  untenanted  land,  both within  andoutside  the  Board&apos;s area,  should be in  accord-ance  with  the scale   set  out  in paragraph  34above,  and  that  the   second and third  clausesof  the First Schedule to the Irish Land Act of 1909  should apply.-   -    * These clauses are:--  (2) In cases where an estate is purchased by the EstatesCommissioners or the Congested Districts Board, and theadvance is made in respect of the estate as a whole, theadvance shall, for the purpose  of the  application of thescale, be apportioned between the  holdings and parcels ofland comprised in the estate in such manner as the EstatesCommissioners or the Congested Districts  Board, as thecase may  be, direct. .  (3) In the  case of the  purchase of a parcel  of unten-anted land, and in  any case where the amount advancedis less  than the purchase money, the number of years&apos;purchase represented by the advance shall be calculatedm manner prescribed by the Treasury, regard being hadin the case of untenanted land to the fair  annual valueof the land to the owner.  The Regulations dated  15th February,  1910,  made bythe Treasury in accordance with  the foregoing provisionare as follows:-For the purpose of the apnlication of thekcale m  the First Schedule of the Irish Land Act, 1909,the number of years&apos; purchase represented by the Advanceshall be ascertained:  I. In the case of the purchase of a parcel of untenantedland by dividing the amount of the purchase money bythe amount which the Estates Commissioners or the Con-gested Districts Board, as the case may he, shall estimateto have been the fair annual, value of such parcel to theowner at the date of purchase.  n. In any case where the amount advanced is less thanthe purchase money, by dividing the amount of the  pur-chase money by the amount of the rent, or in the case ofuntenanted land by the amount which the Estates Com-missioners shall estimate to be its fair annual value to theowner.BONUS TO BE REGARDED AS IMPERIAL EXPENDITURE.  39. It will be remembered that when the pay-ment of a bonus was first proposed in 1903 itwas described  as &quot;a  free gift to heland.&quot;    Ithas  always  been treated as  a payment  to bemade by the tax payers,  not of Great Britainor Ireland,  but  of  Ireland and Great  Britain.In  other words,  though  for  an Irish service, ithas always been regarded as an Imperial obliga-tion.  We see no reason why  land  not  yet  soldshould be differentiated in this respect from landalready sold  or agreed to be sold.   Accordingly,we recommend that  the annual charge for  thebonus payable in future  sales should,  like  thecharges for bonus and excess  stock in completedand pending sales,  be in the first instance  paidby the  Irish Government,  but should,  so  far asGreat Britahvs  share thereof is concerned,  beregarded as  a  contribution by the Irish Govern-ment to  Imperial expenditure.   We hold  thisview all the  more strongly, inasmuch as the costto  the  State  under  the  scheme now proposedfor completing land purchase would be consider-ably  less than the cost to  the- State has been inthe past.  The rate: of bonus payable under thescheme  proposed will average about 15 per cent.on the  purchase money  of  tenanted land  (see Schedule V., pp.      ).,   There is no means ofestimating the average rate  of  bonus that willbe payable on the purchase money of untenantedland, but if  it be assumed that the  rate will notlie substantially different  from that payable inrespect . of tenanted  land,  the  annual cost  tothe. State of the bonus,  if money could bebor-rowed at 5 per cent., would be less.than 4/5 percent,  on  the  total  amount  of. the  purchasemoney.   Thus, for  every million pounds of  pur-chase money  the  annual  cost to the  State  (ifthe  bonus  averaged  15 per - cent.)  would  be 7,875 under 4/5 per  cent. and if  the totalpurchase monej&apos; of land bought under the schemeproposed were   30,000,000, the annual cost tothe State (for 62  years)  would be  236,250*.With these figures may be contrasted the  annualcost  to  the  State  for bonus and  excess stock (which does not arise under  our scheme) in re- spect of the 75 million pounds alreadv advancedunder the Acts 1903-9. This amounts to  753,000or 1 per cent., while the corresponding cost to the State in respect of the 24 million pounds to beadvanced  in  pending  cases  is estimated  at 580,000 per  annum, or slightly under 24  percent.Expenditure on  Land Resettlement by Estates                 Commissioners.   40. Before leaving  the question of finance, wedesire to  draw  attention to  the   necessity  ofmaking  some provision for the expenditure  thatthe  Estates  Commissioners  must incur on  therelief of congestion  within  their area and on  theresettlement  of  untenanted  land.    Under  theAct of  1903  (s.  44) loss oh  the  resale of  &quot;con-gested&quot;  estates within the meaning  of Section 6(5) was  charged on the  parliamentary  vote  forthe Land Commission, and all other expenditureon improvement  was met  out of  the  ReserveFund.  Under the Act of 1909 all loss on  resaleand improvement expenditure was  met out  ofthe Reserve  Fund,  and since  the exhaustion  ofthe latter, which occurred on the 31st May, 1910,out of the parliamentary vote for the Land Corn-mission.   For these  purposes,   75,000 was voted  tThe difficulties in the way  &quot;of arriving at &quot;a satisfactoryestimate of the  probable price of the unsold  land of  Irelandare explained in Appendix A. (see  especially paragraphs8 and 9,  pp. 24-5).
-  in  the year 1913-14, and  30,000 is provided in  the vote for the current year.  The total amount  expended  since 1903 by  the Estates  Commis-  sioners  up  to  date  on  these  purposes  was   685,000.   Of this  sum  360,000, which is less  than A per cent, on the total transactions of the  Commissioners,  is  not  recoverable  from  the  tenant purchasers.   The data available are  not  sufficient to enable us to say whether  a similar  percentage on  the future  transactions of  the  Estates Commissioners  would  be  a  sufficient  provision  to  make in  respect  of irrecoverable  expenditure.   What  money  may be  required  should be voted by the Irish Parliament, but it  is arguable that such expenditure, within certain  limits, and also the cost of the staff of the Land  Commission,  should  be   treated  as  Imperial  expenditure.   A  special  recommendation  has  already been made (see paragraph 4) for  treat-  ing in this manner that part of the  cost of the  Land  Commission which is incurred  in the  col-  lection of purchase annuities.  Expenditure on Land Resettlement by Congested                 Districts Board.    41.  More  can  be said in favour  of  treating  part,  at  least,  of  the  cost  of the Congested  Districts  Board  as Imperial expenditure.   The  Board was created  with the avowed  object of  &quot;developing a backward portion of the Imperial  Estate,&quot; the backwardness  of  which is  largely  attributed, whether rightly or wrongly, to neglect  in  the past.  We,  in this Report, are not con-  cerned with that part  of the Board&apos;s income of   250,000  per  annum which is  devoted to pur-  poses other than  land purchase, but it is worthy  of   serious consideration  whether the  amount  which  the Board  sets  aside for  loss on land  resettlement  (over  100,000 per annum) and the  cost of administration, so far as land  purchase  and resettlement  are  concerned,  should  not be  regarded as Imperial expenditure. If  this view  be accepted,  such expenditure ought, in the first  instance,  to  be defrayed out of  the Irish Con-  solidated  Fund;  but,  so  far  as Great Britain&apos;s  share thereof is  concerned,  should be reckoned  as part payment of whatever contribution Ireland  may have to make towards Imperial expenditure.   Question of reservation of Congested  Districts           Board  and Land Commission.     42. In  paragraph 7  we  recommend  that; as  the Land  Commission will continue  to have  certain discretionary powers in respect of pend-  ing cases, it should remain a &quot;reserved&quot; service  so far as its functions in respect of these cases  are concerned; the reason  being that it seems  not unreasonable that pending cases  shoidd be   completed under the control of the  Government   under whose  auspices proceedings were insti-   t-uted.   The same reason does not  apply   in   future sales under the  scheme which we propose.   Neither  the  Board nor  the  Estates  Commis-   sioners would have any important discretionary   power as between landlords and tenants; every-  . thing would work automatically, and it  might   srive rise to great friction if  the work  of the   Board and the Commissioners, which is nothing   less  than the  resettlement  of the  unsold agri-   cultural  land of  Ireland, were carried  out   bydepartments  which, would not  be. under  thecontrol of the Irish Government nor responsibleto the Irish Parliament.           Reservation  not desirable.  43. We  are,  therefore,  of opinion  that  theCongested Districts Board should not be reservedat all,  and that  the reservation  of  the  LandCommission should cease on the appointed dav.On that  day the Land Commission would prac-tically cease to be a judicial tribunal decidingcases between landlords on the one  hand  andtenants  or  the Estates Commissioners or  theCongested  Districts  Board on the  other  hand,except as  regards the  fixation  by  the JudicialCommissioner of the price of untenanted land.The  fact that the removal of the present JudicialCommissioner,  as of all other existing judges,would presumably be reserved,  as it was in theGovernment  of Ireland Act, to the  Crown onan address from the Imperial Parliament, would,so far as  he  is concerned, meet any purposethat could  be secured by reservation of the LandCommission.  The appointment of  any JudicialCommissioner  whom it might  be necessary toappoint  hereafter might  be  left  to the LordChancellor of  Leland,  if  he becomes a  non-political  officer, or to the Imperial Government.  44. The  Land Commission,  after the appointedday,  and the  Congested Districts Board,  afterthe  passing of  the  Act, could  therefore bebrought  into any scheme  the Irish Parliamentmay adopt for the amalgamation and consolida-tion of Irish departments,  due regard being hadto the interest of all existing Irish officers.                Sporting Rights.  45. We have already recommended that on thetransfer  of untenanted land within the Board&apos;sarea the landlord should  have the  privilege ofretaining sporting rights (par 23), and  we  are ofopinion  that  the same rule should  prevail inrespect of  untenanted  land.outside the Board&apos;sarea.   As  regards  tenanted  land,  we  are ofopinion  that rights of shooting should pass tothe  tenants, the  Congested  Districts  Boai&apos;d orthe  Estates Commissioners, unless by agreementbetween landlords, on the  one hand, and tenantsor the Congested Districts Boai-d or the EstatesCommissioners, on the  other hand,  these rightsare  retained  by the  landlords.    We recognisethat sporting rights are of considerable value inmany districts, and that,  as  was pointed  out inparagraph 249 of the Final Report of  the RoyalCommission on Congestion (Cd. 4097,  1908), thedissipation of  these rights  amongst a number ofsmall occupiers usually results in the partial ortotal loss  of  what might be developed into an important national asset.   We, therefore, are of opinion  that the, Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners should,  in the  inte- rests of the tenant purchasers, promote, as far as they can, the preservation of  these  rights, and encourage in suitable cases the formation of as- sociations, and the  appointment of trustees for this purpose.   As regards fishing  rights,  we are of opinion that the landlord, where he possesses these rights,  should  have  the privilege of retain- ing or disposing of them,  together with all neees- sary rights of access for  the purpose of fishing. In  cases where the landlord does not desire to re- tain, or dispose of  these  rights,  we  recommend that they should be retained  by the Congested Districts  Board  or  the Estates  Commissioners. when they are of opinion  that the preservation of such rights would conduce to national interests.
279     Question of a  Perpetual  Rent  Charge.   46.  We have  considered  the suggestion,  not infrequently made from time to time, that a per- petual rent-charge should be  reserved in favour of the State on all holdings  sold under the Land Purchase Acts.  It will be remembered that such a proposal was embodied in  the  Land  Bill of 1903 as introduced  into the House of Commons but was abandoned.  We have not examined the merits of  the proposal,  since,  if we made a re- commendation  in   favour   of a  perpetual  rent charge,  it could  apply only to the tenants who have not  yet purchased their holdings,  and we do not  consider that  it would be  practicable,&quot;even if it were desirable, to  propose that  one- eighth  of  the landholders of  Ireland should be put in a position different from that  occupied by the  remaining seven-eighths.   47.  We  desire to express our high  appreciation of the help  afforded us by our Secretary, Mr. Walter Callan.  His knowledge of the Land Acts and Land Finance  is admirable in its range and accuracy.  His power of doing work, his  helpful- ness and his courtesy have most materially con- tributed to the completion of  our work.

SCHEDULE  I.THE SIZE  OF  THE PROBLEM  OF  THE   COMPLETION OF LAND PURCHASE.            (On  31st March, 1917).  1.  The following table, which has been alreadygiven in paragraph 2 of the Report,  contains par-ticulars  of the land (1) already sold,  (2) agreedto be sold, and (3) not yet the subject of pro-ceedings:               Col. 1.

The area not yet the subject of proceedingsunder the Land Purchase Acts (col.  2)  is 30 percent,  of the total  agricultural area of Ireland,whilst its valuation (col. 3) is 36 per cent, of thetotal  valuation of the agricultural land of Ire-land.   3. From these two factors it might be inferred that the total  problem still to  be faced is one- half of  that  already  completed or in  process  of completion, but, for reasons which appear below, it is evident that the size of the problem to be dealt with under the proposed scheme is not so great,   4. The financial size of the problem (col. 4) has by some been estimated, very roughly, at 72 mil- lion pounds; but this figure is of little value, as it* was arrived at merely by  multiplying the annual poor law valuation of the land unsold by 20 (the average number of years&apos; purchase  given of the poor law valuation of the lands  dealt with under the Acts 1903-9).  Neither  the  multiplicand nor the multiplier can be relied on.  In the first place the multiplier is quite unreliable.   On the one hand, it might be larger in future cases than in past cases, for  the land unsold  includes a much larger proportion of untenanted land than did the land already sold; and a greater  number of years&apos; purchase has always  been given of the poor law valuation  of  untenanted than of tenanted land. since in the former case the vendor has a larger interest in the land.  On the other hand, recent changes in  the  money market must haAe the effect of decreasing  the multiplier.    When the purchase money  is paid in stock bearing 5 per cent,  interest,  the same  number of years&apos; pur- chase cannot be  expected  as  when the  pur- chase money was paid in stock which carried only 8 per cent, interest, or when the purchase money was paid in cash and the rate of interest on trustee investments was estimated at about 3J per cent.  5. The multiplicand is  equally  unreliable, for the  unsold land includes demesnes, home farms, townparks, etc, none of which must, and few of which probably will, be sold under the proposed scheme.   Moreover,  it includes  a large quantity of untenanted land outside  the  area of the Con- gc-sted Districts Board, of which  only a portion will be  sold under the proposed scheme.  6. It  is also  difficult to estimate  the  number of  holdings (col.  1)  remaining for  sale.  The total number of agricultural holdings in Ireland, according  to  the  Agricultural Statistics  of  1915is 569,426.   Of this total,  105,005  were under 1 acre.   This class  includes  labourers&apos;  cottageplots (of which  there are  over 47,00 in Ireland) and many small gardens, etc., which are outsidethe  operations of the Land Purchase Acts.   Still a certain number of  holdings  under  1  acre have been sold  under  the  Acts,  and  more may  be.The Land Commission cannot give any estimateof the number of such holdings.   Probably it is-not  exaggerating the size of the problem to saythat at  least 5,000 holdings under 1 acre havepassed or  will  pass  under  the  Land  PurchaseActs.  This Mould  suggest that the total numberof agricultural holdings that have passed or arelikely to pass under the  Land Purchase  Actsmight be taken  as 470,000.   This, however,  i?probably an under-estimate, for a certain num-ber of non-agricultural holdings (eg., holdings in,towns and villages) have been already sold underthe  Land   Purchase   Acts,  and  more  will  be -similarly sold unless  the law is  changed  in this-respect.  No estimate is available as to  the num-be of such  holdings;  and therefore all  that canbe said is that the total number of holdings whichhave been  sold,  or are likely to  be sold,  is over470,000.   As  the number  of holdings alreadysold  or agreed to be sold is just under 410,000 thenumber remaining to be sold would appear to beover 60,000.   This figure, which,  in view of the                                      N
uncertainty regarding holdings under 1 acre andnon-agricultural holdings, is largely hypothetical,is liable to modification in view of the followingfact.   7. The term  &quot; holding &quot; both in the Agricul-tural Statistics and in the Census Returns (which-are classified on a basis different from that of theAgricultural Statistics)  includes not merely hold-ings occupied by tenant purchasers and tenants,but also demesnes, home farms, and other hold-ings of untenanted land.  Most of these holdings--would be  included in the 10,444  holdings givenin the Agricultural Statistics as above 200 acresin extent, and in the  13,472 holdings which are.given in the Census Returns for 1911 as exceed-mg  100 valuation/  There is no means of ascer-taining how many of the large  holdings in ques-tion are (1) held by tenants, (2) held by tenantpuichasers, and (3) are  untenanted.    All thatcan be  said is that, if 60,000 be the total number-of holdings (in the wider sense) as yet unaffectedby the Land Purchase Acts, the number of hold-ings occupied by tenants, all of which will underthe proposed  scheme pass either to the tenants,or the Congested Districts Board,  or the EstatesCommissioners, must be less than 60,000,  andpossibly may not be more  than 50,000.   8. It is impossible to give even  an estimate ofthe probable price of the tenanted  holdings whichwill pass under the proposed scheme, the numberof which may be roughly put  at  50,000.   Theaverage valuation of the 300,000 holdings alreadysold was  17 and the average price  325.   Theaverage valuation of the 100,000 holdings in pro--cess of sale is  12  and the average price  240.On the one hand the  average price of the hold-ings remaining  to be sold may well be  consider-ably  greater than the average price of the hold-ings sold or agreed to be sold, for the former classundoubtedly includes a very much larger  propor-tion  of large  tenanted holdings  than  does thelatter.   Less  than 1,300 holdings  have been soldunder the Land Purchase Acts at a price exceedingthe  3,000 limit, and undoubtedly the number oflarge holdings remaining unsold, the price of whichwould  exceed that limit,  is very  much greater.On the other hand, it has to be remembered thatthe. purchase money of all  unsold holdings  willhe less than was the purchase money of holdingsof a corresponding valuation already sold becauseof the change, already referred to, in the financialbasis; that is, the change from cash capable of in-vestment at rates varying from 3  per cent, to 4per cent., or stock bearing interest at 3 per cent.,to stock  bearing interest at  5 per cent.   If theaverage price of the unsold holdings say 50,000 works out at the average  price  of the 100,000&quot;holdings  now in process of sale ( 240),  the totalpurchase money for the tenanted land of  Irelandremaining for sale would be 12 millions.    If  itworks  out at the  average price of  the 300,000holdings  already sold ( 325), the total price ofthe tenanted land of Ireland to be sold under thescheme would be slightly over 16 millions.    Inview of the size of some of the larger  tenantedholdings  remaining for sale the total price mayhe considerably higher.   9. As regards the untenanted land,  it is  irn-possible to give any estimate of the probable pur-chase money  involved.   All  the untenanted landwithin  the Board&apos;s  area (other  than  demesne   * It is important to note that the total acreage of these13,472 large holdings exceeded four million acres and that-their  total poor&apos;law valuation  exceeded three millionpounds, or nearly one-third of. the total valuation of theagricultural land of  Ireland.and home farms, etc.) is to be bought under thescheme,  but even within this  limited area it isimpossible to obtain any definite estimate  of theamount  of  untenanted land or  of  its probableprice.  Outside  this area  the amount of land tobe  bought  depends  upon the  requirements ofthe Estates Commissioners and of the CongestedDistricts Board for the relief  of congestion andresettlement,  and  it is  impossible  to  offer anyopinion  whatever upon  the  probable  purchasemoney.               SCHEDULE  II.        PURCHASERS&apos;  ANNUITIES.  1. The total  advances made for land purchasesince 1870 up  to 31st March last was 98h mil-lions.  The difference  between this amount  andthe  100  milliQns,  mentioned  in  paragraph 2 ofthe Report as  the  purchase money cf the landsold,  was  provided  by the purchasers in cash.Some of the advances have  been redeemed  bythe purchasers; the  annuities  payable  on  the ad-vances not so redeemed amount to over  2f mil-lions.  2. Advances  made under  Acts prior  to the Actof 1891  were  made in  casli  and amounted tonearhr  lOf  millions.   The  annuities  payablethereon are sufficient to pay the  interest chargeand to amortise the  sums advanced within a eer-tain period, which was for the most part a fixedperiod of 49 years,  extended  to  79 years wherethe purchasers  availed themselves, as most  did,of three decadal reductions.  The only financialdifficulty that arises in these cases is where pur-chasers do  not pay their  annuities punctually.Any loss  so  incurred is,  where &quot; guarantee de-posits &quot; are not available, defrayed out of publicfunds  provided by  the   annual   Public  WorksLoans Act.  The total loss since  1881 has beenonly a little over  5,000,  and  the  average annualloss is practically  negligible.  3. Advances  made under the Acts of 1891-6were made in  stock, and amounted to over 13millions.  The  annuities payable thereon are suf-ficient to pay  interest charges and redeem thestock within a  period which  was  not fixed butwhich was estimated at 42A years (extended by30 years in the ease of purchasers who  availedthemselves  of  three decadal  reductions).   Theperiod of repayment has been diminished by therise in the rate of  interest.  4. Advances   made   under   the Act of 1903,amounting to  67  millions,  were  made  for themost part  in cash raised  mainly by the issue of2f  per  cent, stock.   Tire  annuities payable inthese  cases  are  sufficient to pay the  interestcharge on, and to  redeem,  an amount of stockequal at face value to the amount  of the cash ad-vanced, within a period which was estimated at68J- years but which will be  less owing to the risein the rate of interest.  The purchasers  have noliability for the &quot; Excess Stock &quot; which  had tobe created owing to the stock being issued at adiscount.   (See Schedule III.)  5. Advances   made   under   the Act of 1909,amounting to nearly 8 millions, were made forthe most part in 3 per cent, stock  and  the annui-ties  payable  are in these cases sufficient to  paythe interest charge on and  redeem the stock is-sued within, a. period which was estimated at 65years, but which will be less owing to  the rise inthe rate of interest.
280   6. Ignoring the  question of Excess Stock  (as to which, see Schedule III.), it may be said that the  purchasers&apos;  annuities are  sufficient to pay the charges for  interest and sinking fund arising from advances  made  under the Land Purchase Acts, 1891-1909.  Financial  difficulty arises only where purchasers  do  not pay their annuities punctually, and any deficiency so  caused is met out  of the  Guarantee   Fund,  which (avoiding technicalities) may be  said to consist of various grants,  paid into the  Irish  Local Taxation Ac- count and paid  thereout to county councils.   So far as the  Guarantee  Fund is called  upon  to make good the deficiency caused by the non-pay- ment of  tenant purchasers&apos;  annuities, the Irish ratepayers have to bear the  loss.*   7. The  permanent loss so  caused to the Guar- antee Fund  has,  however,  been  almost infini- tesimal.   On each dividend day, or day on which payments have to be made in resjiect of  interest and  sinking  fund,  the  Guarantee  Fund is  in- variably called upon to meet deficiencies arising from tenant purchasers not having  paid their an- nuities on the preceding gale day.   Most of thismoney,  however,  is required to meet cases  of unpunctuality,  not  of  absolute  failure  to pay. During the year 1916-17 the  amount of  the an- nuities pavable  under  the Land Purchase  Acts, 1891 -1909,&quot; was  2,555,283.  At the beginning  of the year the arrears amounted to  28,053, but  as  32,558,216 was collected during  the year, the arrears on 31st  March, 1917, amounted  to only  25,120,  of which over two-thirds were collected during the next three months.!  8.  Againstthe charges on the Guarantee Fund that  accrue  each half year in respect of  current arrears must be  set the  repayments which are being continually made in respect of old  arrears. In several recent  years,  the  repayments  thus made to  the  Guarantee Fund have been greater than the amount drawn out.  Thus,  in the vear ended 31st  March,  1916,   189,000  was  drawn out of, and  196,000 was paid into, the Guaran- tee Fund  in respect of arrears.  In the following year the amount drawn out  was   199,949 and the amount repaid was   195,734.  9.  Each year  the  full amount of the annuities payable is increased in  consequence  of fresh ad- vances having been  made, and by the time land purchase is  completed  they may amount to five millions  or  more,  and  consequently the  total average amount  of  arrears may well be larger than at present.  On the other hand, it must be remembered that each year a tenant purchasers interest in his holding grows greater,  and  that if, through misfortune, he  falls  into  arrear  and  a sale becomes necessary, there is  available for realisation not merely  what  was  formerly the  * A small loss may  fall upon the Guanantee  Fund  in consequence of unproductive balances, but this item  is trifling.  t An elaborate system exists to ensure the speedv col- lection of; arrears.  A  few  weeks  after each gale day, a &quot;solicitors letter&quot; is sent to each purchaser in arrear: it this is not sufficient, a civil bill  is issued, and,  if neces- sary  a decree obtained at  Quarter Sessions.  After this another demand is made,  and then, if  necessarv, the sheriff seizes  the  debtor&apos;s goods.  If  there  are not sufficient  goods to satisfv  the claim,  or if the writ  is returned endorsed &quot; no goods.&quot; the Land Commission pro- ceeds to sell the holding, but this is not often necessarv as  more and more  of the arrears  come in  at each stao-eot  the proceedings.   Like  proceedings are taken in the Superior Courts where the  debt due  is in  excess of theamount for  which  proceedings may be  taken in the bounty Court.  It is  very rare  for the full  amountot  arrears not  to  be  recovered  on   the   sale  ofthe holding  Where loss is incurred, it is  generally dueto the difficulty of effecting  a sale  in consequence of localteeline. landlords interest  (in respect of which the an- nuity is being paid),  but also the tenant right.or occupation interest.   10. It is  of  importance in this connection to note that when  a defaulting tenant  purchaser causes a charge  to be made on the Guarantee Fund,  the  amount of that  charge is  deducted, ultimately,  not from the total  amount  of  the death  duty  grant,  or other item in the - Local Taxation Account, available for the whole of Ire- land but -from  that share of the grant  which is payable to the county in which the holding of the defaulting  tenant is situate.  This  narrow ing down of the  area responsible  for  the loss caused by a  purchasers  default  is&apos; said  to have an  excellent effect in moulding public  opinion against defaulters,  and,  in accordance with  the wish of the  county councils, the Land Commis- sion now  communicates  to  the  councils  the names  of defaulters in each county, so that local public  opinion may be directed  against them.   11. Any loss arising from  the  non-payment of annuities thus falls, under the present law, upon Irish funds,  except  in the case of advances made under Acts prior to 1891, and,  as has been seen, the loss in  these  cases is practically negligible.   12. In both the Home Rule Bill of 1893 and. the Government of Ireland Act, 1914, it was pro- vided that  the liability  which now  attaches  to the Guarantee  Fund  should  attach to the Irish Consolidated  Fund; that is,  that  Irish   funds should  have to  make  good, as they do now, any loss caused by  non-payment of purchase  annui- ties. The financial provisions  of both measures were so arranged that the revenue put within the control of the  Irish  Government included the sums now payable into the Irish Local Taxation Account which  go to  form the Guarantee Fund. It  rested with  the Irish Parliament to  decide whether they would continue to  pay out  of the Irish revenue to the Irish  Local  Government Councils annual sums similar to  those  now pay- able out of the  Local  Taxation Account, or whe- ther they would  make other arrangements.   It was also within the  province of the Irish Govern- ment to decide  whether they would continue the- system  referred to  above, under which  these grants  in relief of  rates  have  to bear  the loss caused  by default, and whether they would con- tinue the arrangement under which the  area  of responsibility is so  narrowed down  that  each county  suffers the loss incurred by the default  of purchases of holdings in  that county.   13. No objection  was  taken  in Parliament  to the  Irish Consolidated Fund assuming this lia- bility for loss caused by  non-payment of pur- chase annuities.  In respect  of future  advances- objection cou-ld reasonably be  taken to  such  a course  only  if  a  reckless  policy   of  sanctioning advances beyond  the  value of  holdings  were to^ be adopted by some authority not under tire con- trol of the Irish Government.   14. Under the Bill of 1893 and the Act of 1914, whilst the Irish Government  would have to bear any loss  incurred by the non-payment of pur- chasers&apos; annuities, it  was the Imperial and not the  Irish Government that was  to continue to collect  these annuities.    This  division of func- tions, which  arose from treating  the administra- tion of the Land Purchase Acts as a reserved ser- vice, seems undesirable.  Any remissness on the part of the Imperial  Government  in collecting annuities would  involve not that Government butthe Irish Government  in,  at any rate, temporary-loss.  Moreover, the policy of leaving the collec-                                     N2
tion of purchase annuities in Ireland to the  1m-perial Government, which must have recourse toIrish Courts and Irish officials for  the enforce-ment&quot;of their  claims, seems  to involve  an un-necessary case of  concurrent  jurisdictions.  15. The Bills of 1886 and 1893 and the Act of1914 show some variance in the treatment  pro-posed for loss caused by  non-payment  of annui-ties due for  land purchase prior to 1891.  As hasbeen seen, this loss now falls not on the Guaran-tee  Fund but on funds common  to the  UnitedKingdom.   The loss  is,  however,  practicallynegligible and the Irish Government might  wellundertake   all  liability   connected   with  theseannuities.             .  SDIISDUO  III.

If  stock had always been issued atpar,  the  tenants&apos; annuities would have sufficedto  discharge the  liabilities  on the stock issued.Stock,  however,  could  never  be issued at  par,and in order  to  obtain  100 cash it has been neces-sary to issue, on  the average, over  115 Stock.&quot;As a purchasers&apos;  annuity sufficed to provideinterest and sinking fund  on  only   100 of this 115 stock,  the interest and sinking fund on  thebalance,  which is known  as  &quot; Excess Stock,&quot;w-as,  under Sect. 36 (6) of the Act of 1903, madepayable out  of the  Guarantee  Fund.   For  thepurpose of this charge the  grant, known as  the  Ireland Development  Grant &quot; formed the  firstitem  of the  Guarantee Fund.  2.  The  history of  the Ireland  DevelopmentGrant may  be recalled.   In  1902, wdien newgrants for education were made payable in Eng-land  and Wales, a corresponding grant for Scot-land was included in the Scottish Education vote,. and a pledge was given to make an equivalent-annual  grant in Ireland.  In  the following year,by  3  Edward VII., c. 23, this grant was fixed at 135,000  per annum, and it was enacted that somuch of  the grant  as was  not  required for pur-poses connected with  Land Purchase under  theIrish  Land Act of 1903  should be  paid into anaccount called  the  Ireland Development  Grantand  devoted to  education,  the  promotion  ofeconomic development and  transit facilities.  TheIrish  Land Act of 1903 (sects. 38-9), made provi-sion for the payment, out of this grant, of  20,000a year  to the  Congested Districts  Board,  and 5.000  a year to Trinitv College.   The balanceof  the  grant went into  the cash portion of  theGuarantee Fund,  but so far as it was not wantedto  meet charges on  that Fund, it was to be.de-voted to  the  purposes  already specified,  viz.,education and  the  promotion  of  economic  de-velopment   and  transit facilities. . A  certainamount was so expended,  but  owing to the  in-  * At the present  moment it would  be  necessary toissue nearly  185 of  2f  per cent. Stock in order to obtain 100 cash.creasing charge on it,  as  the first- item in  theGuarantee Fund liable  for charges arising out ofExcess Stock, the amount available for educa-tion and economic purposes grew steadily less.  3. In 1909 the annual charge on the GuaranteeFund in respect of Excess  Stock amounted toover  100:000 per annum, and it was calculatedthat, at the then market value of the stock,  thecharge would rise to  750,000 per annum beforeLand Purchase  was completed.  Such  a chargeon  the  Guarantee  Fund would have swallowedup  not only  the whole of  the  balance of  theIreland Development Grant,  the  first  item,  forthis purpose,  in the  cash portion of the, Guar-antee Fund, but also  the whole  of the seconditem, the  Death  Duty Grant,  and  half of  thethird item, the Agricultural Grant, and so wouldhave dislocated the finance of the  county  anddistrict councils throughout  Ireland.   It  wastherefore provided  by the Irish  Laud Act, 1909,Sect, 7, that, once the   100,000 available out ofthe  Ireland Development Grant was exhausted,any further deficiency in respect of Excess Stockshould  be  made good not  out of  the GuaranteeFund but out of money voted by Parliament.*  4. The   160,000 available  out  of  the IrelandDevelopment Grant became fully hypothecated in1910, and  the sums necessary to meet the  fur-ther loss on Excess Stock have  since been votedas part of the cost of  the Irish Land  Commis-sion. The  sum voted  under this head in  theyear ended  31st March,  1917,  was  280,000,and the sum actually  paid out was  267,740,in addition to the  160,000 a year available  outof the Ireland Development Grant.  5. The question of  Excess Stock does not. asa general  rule arise  in  the case  of  advancesmade under the Act of  1909, that is, in the caseof agreements entered  into after  the 15th Sep-tember, 1909, as they are financed on a differentbasis,  namely,  by the payment  to  vendors ofthe  new  3 per  cent.   Stock  at  its  face value.Land, however,  bought by  the  Congested Dis-tricts Board or  the Estate Commissioners, eom-pulsorily or under a  final offer,  has to be paidfor  in cash,  and this may involve  the  issue ofExcess  Stock,  the charge for which would  fallupon the parliamentary vote for the  Land Corn-mission.  6. Two points may  be  noted which have abearing on Excess Stock.   In  the  first place,the  duration of  the purchasers&apos; annuities is  notfixed: they are  to  continue until  the accumula-tion of  the sinking fund of  10s. per year (pay-able in two half-yearly instalments) per  100advanced is sufficient to amortise the debt.  Theduration of the annuity  consequently  dependson  the  rate  of  interest earned by the sinkingfund.  If this were a  uniform rate of 2f  percent, (the  rate  of interest payable on the stockby  which purchases under the  Act of  1903  arefinanced) the annuities  would run for 68i years;if the rate  were a uniform  one of 3 per cent.(the rate of interest payable  on the  stock  bywhich purchases  under the Act  of 1909  arefinanced) the  annuities  would run for 65 years;if the rate were a uniform rate of 5 per cent, (therate of  interest  yielded  by investment in 2f  percent, stock and 3 per cent,  stock  at present  * The  charge for unearned  or  bonus dividend, whichuntil 1909 was met out of  the Guarantee Fund, is  nowdefrayed in the same way as the charge for Excess Stock.Ai the unearned or bonus dividend is really a device toincrease the attractiveness  of  the Stock, this treatmentas part of the cost of flotation seems appropriate.
 prices)  the annuities would run for 48i  years. The  actual rate allowed  is  fixed by. Treasury rules at 2f per  cent,  in  the case  of  annuities under the Act  of  1903,  and at 3 per  cent, in the case of annuities  under the Act of 1909. These rates are liable to  variation in accordance with the rates of  interest  actually  obtained by the National  Debt Commissioners.    The rates so  far earned are practically those fixed by the Treasury rules, since the sinking fund payments are utilised for the purpose of making fresh ad- vances.  The  sinking fund payments now amount to  a total of nearly i million pounds per annum which is increasing,  and the utilisation  of  this increasing  sum for the purpose of making fresh advances  thus  reduces  (by  its amount)  the amount  of cash that has to  be  annually  raised by the issue of stock.   Consequently, the annual charge for Excess Stock is  less than it would be if the sinking  fund were not utilised in the man- ner &quot;mentioned.     Once land purchase  is com- pleted sinking fund  payments will  cease  to be so  utilised,  and can be invested at  higher rates than 2f per cent,  and 3  per cent,  (unless  the money  market completely  changes)  and  conse- quently  the  annuities  will  cease in  less than 68i years and 65 years respectively.   7. The second point to be noted in connection with Excess Stock is that the charge  therefor has been considerably less  than  it would  other- wise have  been had  not many vendors availed themselves  of the  option given in  the Act of 1909 of securing  special  priority by accepting payment in 2f per cent,  stock or half in cash and half in stock instead of  all  cash.  The  ad- varices  thus effected  amounted to  over 14 mil- lions.  The stock so taken was at the minimum price of   92.  These  arrangements reduced con- siderably the  amount of Excess  Stock  that  had to be created.                    Bonus.  8. A  cash bonus  of twelve million pounds was provided in the  1903  Act for the purpose of bridging the gulf between the price tenants were willing to pay and  the  price at which landlords were willing to sell.   On the assumption that 100 millions  would  be sufficient  to complete land purchase, this bonus was payable under  the statute  at  the rate of  twelve per cent, on  the purchase money advanced,  such rate to be con- tinued for  a period of  five years&quot;.   On  the  ex- piration  of that period  (1st November&apos;, 1908) it was found that 100 millions would not suffice to complete land purchase,&apos; and the Treasury,  in accordance with their statutory power, reduced the  percentage from  twelve to three per cent., at which rate it would have remained for at least five years,  had not a new Act been passed in 1909.  This Act removed the twelve million limit and provided  for the payment of  a graduated bonus at rates ranging  from 0 to 18 per cent., varying inversely with the number of years&apos; pur-chase Of the rent.  The average rate of bonuspaid since 1909 has been just over 10 per cent.It was calculated some  years  ago that the capi-tal  sum payable as bonus under existing arrange-ments would,  before  Land Purchase was  com-pleted, amount to  at least  15 milhons to pro-vide which, at the  then price of stock,  it wouldbe necessary to issue over 17 millions stock, and,in the present condition of the money market,this  sum   must  be   exceeded.    *  Roughlyspeaking, about  10 millions worth of stock hasalready   been  issued  to  provide  bonus,  and  335,000 was  voted in  the year ended 31stMarch,  1917, to pay the interest  and sinkingfund on this stock.   Of this sum  324,659 wasactually required in the year ended 31st Marchlast to make the payments necessary  in respectof bonus.       Annual Cost of  Completed Cases.  9.  The  total  charges  in  the year 1916-7 forthe annual  payments necessary for the ExcessStock and for the stock issued to provide a cashbonus in respect of the 75 million pounds worthof land sold since 1903 up to the 31st Marchlast were:    (a) For Excess Stock      payable  out of the      Ireland Development      Grant    ...      ...   160,000      payable out of Land      Commission  Vote ...   268,000                         -    428,000  (b) For Bonus payable out  of the      Land Commission Vote     ...    325,000                                       . 753,000 These sums are at present paid out of the par- liainentary votes, but are classified in the Trea- sury Returns as Irish expenditure  and included in  the 121 millions  shown as  the  cost of Irish Government.   It will be  noted that the  annual cost to the State of  Excess Stock and Bonus in completed cases is  1 per  cent, on  the  total ad- vance.*                                  ,           PART. II.   PENDING  CASES.                 Excess Stock.   10.  About three-quarters of the  pending cases come  under the Act of 1903,  and so require pay- ment  in cash.   Such payment would involve the issue  of Excess Stock,  as described  above,  ex- cept so far as the vendors have agreed to  accept payment wholly or partly in stock.  Moreover, in  a certain number of the pending cases under the Act of 1909  payment in cash is required. As nearly as can  be judged about 19 millions cash will have to be raised in order to complete pending cases.  After making allowance for  the utilisation  of sinking fund payments during  the next three years, this would seem  to involve,, at present prices,  the  issue  of  a  large amount  of Excess Stock, the exa^t amount of which  would vary  according  as  the cash  was raised by the issue of 2f per cent,  or 3 per  cent. Stock, but the annual charge for which would, at present prices, be certainly not less than  440,000.                    Bonus.  11. As&apos; regards the land which landlords have agreed to sell for 3 per cent, stock,  the total pur- chase money of which is under five  millions, the State is not under the existing law involved in loss, except in l-espect of bonus.  On  the  whole twenty-four millions that represent  the  price of pending  cases,  bonus has to be paid.  At the present average rate  of bonus (10 per cent.),this would amount to   2,400,000  cash, and toraise this sum  would involve, at present prices,an  annual  charge for  interest and  sinking  fundof over  140,000/  * Liability for Excess  Stock  does not arise where ad- vances are made in Stock under the Act  of 1909.

  Annual Cost of completion of pending cases.  12. Consequently  the completion  of pendingcases would involve  a charge to the  State  forexcess stock and bonus which cannot, at presentprices, be  put at less than  580,000 a year, ornearly 24 per cent,  per annum on the amount ofthe advances.      PART III.   NATURE OF CHARGE FOR           EXCESS STOCK AND BONUS.  13. The  actual annual charge for Excess Stockand  Bonus in completed cases is  753,000,  andthe same charge for  pending  cases  is estimatedat not less than  580,000,  making a total of 1,333,000.  The bonus was always  regarded as&quot;a free gift to Ireland,&quot; that is, it was to be paid,not  by the  tax-payers of Great Britain  or ofIreland, but  of the  United Kingdom as a whole;and  the  charge for Excess Stock was similarlytreated in 1909.  Though  160,000-a year of thatcharge is met out  of the  Ireland Development-Grant, there  is no difference in principle betweenthat portion of the  change and the balance.   Asalready mentioned,  the whole   cost of ExcessStock and Bonus is included in the 12iJ millionsshown in the Treasury Returns as the cost  of theIrish Government.  It is certainly an Irish  ser-vice  but  an Imperial  obligation.              SCHEDULE IV.METHOD OF FINANCING FUTURE SALES.  1. The  method adopted in 1903, under  whichlandlords were to be paid in cash, to be raised bythe issue  of 2f per  cent, stock, broke  down be-eause,  owing to the  increasing discount at  whichthat stock had to be issued, the cost in respectof Excess  Stock became very heavy.   To  revertto that system would now be  impossible.   Thisdiscount is at present nearly 46 per cent.   Con-sequently,  at the existing prices, the State  wouldhave to pay an annual sum for Excess Stock notfar short of the purchasers&apos; annuities.  2. In   1909   the   Land  Commission   wasauthorised in future cases to revert to paymentin stock (3 per cent.) at its face value.   Thischange in  the stock necessitated  an increase inthe purchasers&apos; annuities from 3J to 3i per cent.,and this increase,  to  a  certain extent, checkedland purchase,  since tenants could not, withoutincreasing  the amount of their  annuities give thesame  number  of  years&apos;  purchase  as  they didunder  the Act of  1903.   The  real reason, how-ever, why purchase was  notablv  cheeked  underthe Act of 1909 was that the  3 per cent,  stockwas never negotiable except  at  a considerablediscount,  which  vendors  feared  would becomeincreased before they received payment; and theincrease in that discount, which  is now 41 percent.,  has naturally stopped all proceedings.   3. Some change  in  finance seems necessary ifland  purchase is  to  be  speedily  completed onequitable terms.    TREASURY INQUIRY INTO FINANCE  OF LAND                    PURCHASE.   4. It will be remembered that  a  small Com-mittee was appointed by the  Chancellor  of  theExchequer at the end of 1907  to inquire into thedifficulties which,,owing to the price  of  2f  percent  -stock,  had arisen in  the  financing of theIrish  Land Act of 1903.  In the  Report (Cd. 4005of 1908) the  Committee  examined  the differentremedies proposed:   (1)  Issue of consols instead  of  stock.   (Pre-        sent  price of consols, 56).  (2)  The  utilisation of the Sinking Fund of the        National Debt.  The objections to these schemes were pointedout in the Treasury Report (p.  11).   It is  suffi-cient  here  to  say that the present conditions ofthe national credit  seem to put  their adoptionout of question at present.  (3)  The extension of the period for repayment.  No  period was fixed in the Act for the durationof purchasers&apos; annuities,  but if  the  sinking fundwas uniformly invested in 2f per cent, stock, theannuities would run for 684 years.   As the  sink-ing fund payments could in  1908 have been in-vested at over 3 per cent, (at present they couldbe invested at 5  per cent.),  it was  suggested tothe  Treasury  Committee  that  the  annuitiesshould run for a fixed  period of 684 years,  andthat the increased  rate  of accumulation  shouldbe utilised to relieve the charge for Excess Stock.It was, however,  pointed out that  it would behardly equitable to make this change  as regardsadvances already made or applied for.   The ten-ant purchasers had, at least,  an equitable  right.to any  shortening  of  the peiiod  of repayment-produced by the rise in the rate  of interest, espe-cially  as they would have had to bear any pro-longation of the  period  of repayment producedby any fall in the rate of interest. As a matter offact,  as has been already pointed out  (see  Sche-dule 111., paragraph 6),  sinking fund paymentsare utilised in making fresh advances  which en-sure a uniform accumulation at 2f per cent, in-terest in cases under the Act of 1903 and at  3per cent, in cases under  the Act of 1909.   Thisrate of  accumulation  will presumably continueuntil  all advances under the Acts of 1903-9 havebeen  made, after which  the sinking  fund  willaccumulate at a higher rate of interest.  A defi-nite  prolongation  of the  period  of repaymentcould  be effected in  the case of  future sales, butit  would not  help matters much.  (4)  A reduction of the Sinking Fund from 10s.        to 5s. per  100  and an increase in the        rate of interest from 2J per cent, to 3 per        cent,  (the  total annuity thus  remaining        the same).  -  The same objection,  in  principle, noted againstthe last suggestion,  applied to this suggestion inrespect of advances  already made  or to be madein pending eases, viz.,  that it involved an altera-tion of the statutory terms on which advances hadbeen  made.  As regards future cases, it was con-sidered that the reduction of the sinking fund toJ per cent.,  would, whilst the rate of  interestremained  at 3 per  cent., involve an undue pro-longation of the period  of repayment.   As a re-sult,  however, of  the  increase in  the  rate ofinterest that  sinking fund  payments  can  earn,the reduction  of the sinking fund to  5s. per cent.is now quite feasible.   (See paragraph 25 of Re-port,  p   ).  (5)  Redeeming the reversion  of the Irish De-        velopment Grant.  This, at best,  would have afforded  trifling re-lief and was open to objections.   5.  The  Treasury Committee recommended thelimitation of the amount of cash to be advanced
for pending cases to the amount&apos; of cash that theNational Debt Commissioners might be in a&apos;posi- .tion to lend from time to time.  This suggestion was not adopted, and does notseem feasible at the present moment.  6. The  Treasury  Committee  also  suggestedthat the landlords should, in cases then pending,be oiven tne option of taking stock at the marketprice of the day  (not lower than  92) in lieu ofcash or in lieu of half the cash,&apos; the inducementto do so being priority.  This suggestion was adopted in the Act of 1909and has been availed of to a limited extent  (seeSchedule III., paragraph 7).*   The effect of thisexpedient has been to reduce the loss on  ExcessStock (see Schedule III., par. 7, p. 32).  7. As regards future advances it was suggestedby  the  Treasury  Committee that money shouldbe provided by the issue of 3 per cent, stock. Ifthe stock could not be  issued at par,  cash ad-vances were to cease, but landlords were to havethe option taking the  stock at its face value.  The method adopted by Parliament  in 1909was payment in 3 per cent stock at its face value,but, as  has  already  been notedr (paragraph 2above) the prospect of receiving payment  in de-preciated  stock,  liable to further depreciation,checked land purchase,  which is  now  entirelystopped by the low price of the stock.         PRESENT FINANCIAL PROBLEM.  8. The fundamental facts of the situation arethat money cannot now be borrowed at less than5 per cent., if at so low&apos;a rate,  and that, on theother  hand, owing to  the  rise in the  rate ofinterest, a 5s. per cent, sinking fund will amortisea loan  as quickly as  would a  10s. sinking fundwhen the rate of interest to be earned was only 3per cent.   If advances are made in cash,  and ifthe purchase annuity is to be sufficient to meet allthe charges for the money so advanced, the rateof the purchase annuity cannot be less than  5\ percent, if so low.  Unless the purchaser has  to payas an annuity a greater percentage of his formerrent than annuities have averaged during the lastfifteen years, which  was under 75 per cent, ofthe rent, the advance cannot be more than four-teen times  the rent,  and many landlords couldnot afford to sell at fourteen  years&apos;  purchase, even though.the proceeds were invested at 5 per cent.   9. It may be that under a  voluntary  system the realisation of the fact that the condition of the money  market precludes  any return to the land purchase terms  of 1903,  except at  an im- mense loss  to the State, might now make land- lords more  ready than  formerly to accept terms involving a  diminution  of income as  compared with net rental, and might also operate to induce tenants to demand a  less reduction in their pur- chase money, as compared with their rent, thanwas formerly the case; but it  seems  inevitablethat the State must  do something to bridge the gulf that will  still exist between the terms at which landlords are willing to sell and those at ^ inch tenants are willing to buy.   10. Three  schemes  have been suggested:- .  1- The fil&apos;st is that landlords should be  paid ino  per  cent,  stock,  and that all charges  mort-gages, etc., should be discharged by the transferof this  stock at its face value.   The latter partcases then pending, was, as has been already noted theremoval  of  the  liability for Excess  Stock from&apos; theGuarantee Fund to  the parliamentary vote for the LandCommission.  (See Schedule III., par 3  p      )of this proposal would  be helpful  to  landlordsonly  wdien  such stock was at a discount, andmight be thought unfair to chargeants.  The tenant purchaser^ annuity could not beless than 5\ per cent.  (5 per cent, interest and Jper cent sinking fund).  If the sinking fund wereuniformily invested at 5 per cent,  interest, thestock could be redeemed in 62 years.  A uniforminvestment at 5 per cent, could be secured byprovision being  made  for the redemption at parevery year  of an  amount of stock  equal to theamount of the annual sinking fund payment, thestock so  redeemable  being determined by lot.Such annual redemption would probably have aslight effect on keeping up the price of the stock.  Unless  the annuity to be paid by the tenantpurchaser is to be a greater proportion of his rentthan  it has  averaged  heretofore, i.e.,  less than75 per cent, in all sales under the Act of 1903, theannuity at 5J per cent, could not provide on theaverage quite 14 years&apos; purchase of his rent. Theinterest at  5  per  cent,  on the amount of  stockthus  provided would in many cases be consider-ably  less  than the landlords net rental.   Thisloss might, however,  be diminished,  if not  en-tirely removed,  by the payment by the State of asuitable, bonus.  One merit of this scheme is that it recognisesthe existing facts of the money market, exceptthat  the  rate of  interest on Government  stockis tending  to rise  above 5 per cent.   From anyrise over the rate of 5 per cent, neither the Statenor the tenants  would suffer; the landlords wouldsuffer,  from  the  consequent  depreciation of 5per cent,  stock, so far as  it was  necessary  torealise stock for the payment of charges.   Thisscheme recognises quite frankly the necessity ofState aid in the shape of a bonus, and there isno partially hidden liabilitv in the shape of ExcessStock.  2.  The second suggestion is that the landlordshould be paid in cash which the Governmentshould borrow as  cheaply as they could,  and forwhich the tenant should be charged at the rateof only 4i per cent., his annuity being at the rateof 4f per cent.  Under this scheme the tenanfsannuity (on the assumption that he would receivethe average reduction of the past) would provideless than 16 years&apos; purchase of his rent.  This scheme  would to some extent follow theAct of 1903, inasmuch as advances would be madein  cash,  and  landlords  and  tenants  would bebrought together  by  the  State  lending cashcheaper than it  could borrow it (which, under theAct  of 1903,  involved the  creation of  excessstock). Apart from the bonus, if any were pay-able,  the State would, in the present conditionof the money market, lose at least i per cent, ininterest per annum on every  100 cash advanced.Moreover,  the loss to  the  State would not, as inthe last scheme, be clear and definite, but wouldincrease with  every  increase in  the  rate  ofinterest.  3.  The third suggestion is that landlords shouldbe paid their purchase money half in  cash andhalf in 3J per cent.  Stock at its face value, andshould receive no  bonus.  This scheme was de-signed to avoid  any unnecessary departure fromthe existing finance of land purchase, especiallyfrom&apos;  the rate of the  annuity which would con-tiriue  at the  present  figure,  3i per cent.   Thesuggestion  that  the  landlord &quot;should  be  paidpartly in cash and  partly  in  stock follows thesuggestion made by the Treasury Committee of1907  and the option given in the Act of  1909.It aims at removing the chief difficulty that con-
fronts a &quot;vendor who is paid in  a stock standingat a large discount, viz., the difficulty of raisingcash  to pay  off charges.  Under this scheme  State  aid takes the formof providing  cash for  half the  purchase  moneyat     per cent, instead of  at the  current rate.To  put it  in another  way,  for every  100 ofpurchase money the landlord would receive   50in 3J per cent, stock and  50 in cash.  To raisethe latter,  the State  would have  to  issue   78stock, assuming that  3J per cent,  stock wouldstand at 64, the figure  indicated  by present rates.As  the tenanfs annuity at 34  per  cent, wouldpay the interest and sinking fund on only  100stock, the State would, in respect of every  100of purchase money, have to bear the interest  andsinking fund  on  28 stock.   This scheme wouldbe the most  costly for the State, and the cost,as in  the second case, would be liable to increasewith each increase in the rate of interest.

The number of years&apos; purchase of the rent           that will be provided by each  tenant           purchaser&apos;s annuity;     3. The rate  of bonus  that will be payable           under  the  scale recommended;     4. The purchase  money receivable by land-           lords in 5  per cent, stock per  100 of           rental;     5. The amount  of the bonus  per  100 of           rental;     6. The total income receivable by landlords           from  the  purchase  money and  the           bonus  (at   5 per cent.)  per  100 of           rental.  It will be noted that the rate of bonus payableis 18 per cent, in each county in the case of &quot; firstterm &quot; rents; 18 per  cent, in 7 counties,  16 percent, in  13 counties,  14 per cent, in 8 counties,and 12 per cent, in  5 counties in  the case of&quot;second  term&quot;  rents; and  12  per cent,  in 4counties,  10 per  cent, in 21 counties,  and 8 percent, in 8 counties in  the case of &quot; third term &quot;rents.  It will be noted that in &apos;each table  the countiesare  given  in. the descending order of the total in-come receivable by landlords; and that, in somecases, the effect of the bonus is to give the land-lord in one county a larger income than the land-lord in another county, though  a larger numberof years&apos;  purchase is  given in the latter countythan in the former.   This result,  if consideredobjectionable,  could be avoided only by graduat-ing the bonus, not according to the number ofyears&apos; or  half-years&apos; purchase  given, but accord-ing to much smaller fractions.

It has to be remembered that  the percentage of a &quot; third term &quot; rent payable as  anannuity (Col. 3) is the maximum payable,  since a purchaser liable for a  &quot; third term &quot; rent is in noease to pay a larger annuity than he would have had to pay if he had not had his rent revised since14th August, 1911 ; that is, if his purchase had been based on a second term rent, and not on a thirdterm rent (see Report, end of paragraph 2S).   Thus a &quot;purchaser in County Londonderry whose renthas been revised since  14th August,  1911, will pay whichever of these two sums be the smaller, viz. :89 1 per cent, of that revised rent  (Table  III. col. 3)  or S3 -6  of the rent payable previous to thatrevision (Table II. col. 1).    Hence the purchase money.and the income receivable by the landlordmay be less than that shown in cols. 6 and S.

STATEMENT  SHOWING THE  DECISIONS  OF THE  CONVENTION  UPON THE  REPORT                OF  THE  SUB-COMMITTEE  ON  DEFENCE  AND  POLICE.                                         (I.C  No. 30.)  The  Convention considered and voted  on theReport (see p.  ) in five sections as follows : I.  The prehrnhiary matter  on page  1, and the      two paragraphs entitled &quot;Naval Defence &quot;      on  page 2.   These paragraphs were as      follows :                NAVAL DEFENCE.  In  regard to  Naval defence,  the Committeeaccept unreservedly the Admiralty&apos;s view that forthis purpose Ireland   must  be   considered  asintegrally connected  with  Great  Britain,  anddefence must, therefore, be  bv one  force under-one control.  It seems to us unnecessary to go into the detailsdiscussed  in the Admiralty&apos;s Memorandum exceptto  say that  in our opinion some  of  the  matterstouched on might well be the subject of agreementbetween the Imperial and Irish Governments.          Adopted.II, The  section  on  page  2 entitled  &quot;Military       Defence &quot;  which was as follows :               MILITARY DEFENCE.   In regard to the military problens, the  Com-mittee assume that under any scheme of  military-defence the  historical Irish  regiments  will be apart of the  regular army, that Ireland will be, asit  has been in  the past, a  valuable  recruitingground, and that the facilities which it offers fortraining  troops  of  all arms will  continue to belargely utilised with the general  approval of theIrish public.   The question of raising a local Territorial Force-necessarily  engaged our&quot; attention,  and Major-General Sir  Charles Callwell was deputed by theWar  Office, in  a letter dated December  19th,1917, to give us assistance on the military mattersinvolved.   The creation of an Irish Defence Force of theterritorial type must be considered in relation tothe general  scheme of defence of the British Isles.   It is impossible, as we think, for the Conventionto formulate at  present either in principle or indetad any scheme for the establishment of such  aForce.    That  question must  largety depend onthe corresponding conditions in England and Scotland.  We, therefore, submit  the following as our conclusions  upon  the  question of an  Irish Defence Force :      (1).  That  at- some  time it is desirable that            Ireland should provide a local force to            serve in Ireland  dining peace, and in            any part of the United Kingdom during            war.     (2).  That we believe Ireland could contribute.            having regard  to its  population and            social conditions, a sufficient number            of  men to  maintain  two  complete            divisions.    (3). That the  character of the organisation          and  conditions of service  cannot be          determined until the character of Home          Defence Forces after the war is decided,          a matter which,  as we  are advised,          will be  uncertain until after the  war,          and  will depend  on the character of          the peace and other circumstances.    (4). That  when  this matter comes under          consideration, the strength and organi-          sation  of  the Irish  Force,  and its          conditions of service should be reported          on b3r a Joint Committee on Defence          consisting of members  of the Imperial          Government and the Irish Government          with mihtarj&quot; advisers nominated by          them, and that the whole matter should          be decided between the  two  Govern-          ments.    (5). That am&quot; such force,  if raised  and  paid          by  the Irish Government,  should be          reckoned as  part of the  contribution          made by Ireland to common Imperial          expenses.    16). That in time of war or imminence of war          all military forces and  organisations in          the United Kingdom must pass under          the  absolute  control  of  the Imperial          Authorities.Amendment proposed  (COLONEL WALLACE):   To  omit the  whole Section and substitute thefollowing :        &quot; The question of the mihtary defence of    Ireland is a matter exclusively for the Imperial    Government.&quot;          Amendment rejected by 49 votes to 22.

The section on page 3 entitled &quot; The question       of Conscription,&quot; which was  as  follows :         THE QUESTION OF CONSCRIPTION.  We have already submitted an  Literim Report,which it will be convenient to reproduce here, onthe practical aspect of  Conscription in  the eventof the establishment of a separate Irish Parliamentand Executive.   The report was as follows  :                         &quot; 29th November,  1917.       &quot; Assuming  that a scheme of self-govem-    ment for Ireland be adopted,  including the    establishment of an Irish Parliament and an    Irish  Executive  Government  responsible    thereto,  we think  that it  would in practice    be impossible  to  impose a  system of  coni-    pulsory sendee in Ireland without, the assent    and co-operation of the Irish Parliament.
      &quot; As to whether, as an abstract proposition,    it would be desirable, by vesting these powers    in the Imperial Parhament, to secnire  united    and simultaneous action in this direction  in    both  islands,  it  is. we think, unnecessary   . for us to express an opinion, as we think it    would be impracticable effectively to enforce    such a demand,  except with the approval  of    the Irish Parhament without Avhich the action    and efficient co-operation  of the  Executive    could not be secured.      &apos;: Indeed, it seems to us a direct consequence    of the creation of  an  Irish Parliament  that    anj&quot;  measure  of  this character  must be    submitted to the Irish Parhament before  it    could be enforced on Ireland.&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;  We desire to emphasise the facf. that the abovereport  deals  onh&quot;  with one aspect  of this  verydifficult and important question,  and  that wewere not  able in the time then at our disposalto go into the possibilities of  joint action by acommon  War Council of the two  Governments,or as to the. effect of there being hereafter a FederalConstitution for the  British Isles.Amendment moved (SIR. WILLIAM GOULDIXG) :       To.  omit the whole section.           Amendment rejected by 48 votes to 29. .      Section adopted,   (See Division List      ).IV. Part II. of the.

VERNON.           PART  I. DEFENCE.   The first head of reference  to the  Sub-Com- mittee, extended as it  has  been  to the question of Conscription,  covers the  whole  ground as to the defence  of  Great Britain  and Ireland, and the  best  military  provision for  that purpose. Ireland  being  an outpost  of  the  British  Isles owing to  its geographical position, it  is deemed essential  that these considerations must be taken into account in devising a scheme of self-govem- ment for Ireland.   It  was  necessary, therefore,  to  obtain  from the Admiralty and from the. Army Council their views  as  to the strategic necessities of the situ- ation, together with information as-to  the extent of the control which they desired to be reserved -to the Imperial Authorities over harbours and parts  of  the foreshore, crown lands,  shipping,- sites for  barracks  and  forts, or.other defensive worivs; also as to what powers should in war or emergency (e.g., imminence of war) be reserved fo the Imperial  Government in  respect of Cus- &quot;toms,  Telephones,   Telegraphs,.. Wireless  and Cable Services,  or of  the  right to  requisitionprivate property, whether ships, lands; buildings,or moveable goods, or of the control of aliens. -  We accordingly requested the Admiralty andthe War Office, in a letter dated November 6th,1917, to  furnish  us with  their  views on thepoints mentioned.  Some delay followed, and itwas  not- until January 21st, 1918, that a memo-randum in regard to Naval matters was suppliedto us by the Admiralty with an intimation thattwo  naval officers would,  if required to do so,give  evidence before the Sub-Committee.   Asthere was no question of raising an Irish NavalDefence Force, we did not consider it necessaryto request the attendance of these officers.               NAVAL DEFENCE.  In regard to Naval defence, the Committee ac-cept unreservedly the Admiralty &quot;s view that forthis  purpose Ireland must  be  considered as in-tegrally  connected   with  Great  Britain,  anddefence must, therefore,  be by one force underone  control.  It seems to us unnecessary to go into the de-tails discussed in the Admiralty&apos;s Memorandum,except to say that  in our  opinion some of thematters touched on might well be the subject ofagreement  between   the  Imperial  and   IrishGovernments.              MILITARY  DEFENCE.  In regard to the military problems,  the Coni-mittee assume that under, any scheme of militarydefence the historical Irish regiments  will  be  apart of the regular army,  that Ireland will be, asit has been  in  the  past, a valuable  recruitingground, and that the facilities which it offers fortraining  troops of all arms  will continue  to  belargely utilised with  the general approval of theIrish public.  The question of raising a local Territorial Forcenecessarily  engaged  our  attention, and Major-General Sir Charles  Callwell was deputed by theWar Office,  in  a letter  dated  December.  19th,1917, to give us  assistance  on the military  mat-ters involved.  The creation of an Irish Defence Force of theterritorial type must be considered in relation tothe  general  scheme  of  defence  of the BritishIsles.  It is impossible, as we think,  for the Conven-tion to formulate at present either in principleor in detail any scheme  for the establishment ofsuch a. Force.   That question must largely.de-pend on the corresponding conditions in Englandand Scotland.  Wre, therefore, submit the follow-ing  as our  conclusions upon the  question of  ahLish Defence Force:--   (1) That at some time it is desirable that Ire-         land should provide a local force to serve         in Ireland during peace, and in any part         of the United Kingdom during war. .
  (2)  That we believe Ireland could contribute,        having  regard  to  its  population  and        social conditions, a sufficient number of-        men to maintain two complete divisions.  (8)  That the character of the organisation and        conditions  of service, cannot  be  deter-        mined until the character of Home De-        fence Forces after the war is decided, a        matter  which, as we are advised, will        be  uncertain until  after  the  war, and        will  depend  on  the character of the        peace  and other circumstances.  (4)  That when this matter comes under con-        sideration, the strength and organisation        of  the Irish Force  and  its  conditions        of  service should be  reported on by a        Joint Committee on Defence  consisting        of members of the Imperial Government        and the Irish Government with military        advisers nominated by them, and that        the whole matter should be decided be-        tween the two Governments.  (5)  That any such  force,  if raised and paid by        . the   Irish   Government,   should  be        reckoned   as  part  of  the contribution        made  by Ireland to common Imperial        expenses.  (6)  That in time of war or imminence of war        all  military  forces  and organisations in        the  United  Kingdom must pass. under        the  absolute  control of  the  Imperial        Authorities..        THE QUESTION OF CONSCRIPTION.  We have already submitted an Interim Report,which it will be convenient to reproduce here, onthe practical aspect of Conscription in  the  eventof the establishment of a separate Irish Parlia-ment  and Executive.   The report was as fol-lows:       29th  November,  1917.      &quot; Assuming that  a scheme  of self-govern-    ment for Ireland be adopted, including the    establishment of an Irish Parliament and an    Irish  Executive  Government  responsible    thereto, we think  that  it would in practice    be  impossible to  impose a system of compul-    sory  service in  Ireland without  the  assent    and co-operation of the Irish Parliament.      &quot; As to whether, as  an abstract proposi-    tion, it would  be desirable, by vesting these    powers in the Imperial Parliament, to secure    united and simultaneous action in  this direc-    tion in  both islands, it is, we  think, unneces-    sary  for  us to  express  an opinion,  as we    think it would  be  impracticable  effectively    to  enforce such  a  demand, except with the    approval of the -Irish  Parliament  without    which the  action  and  efficient  co-operation    of  the Executive could not be secured.       &quot; Indeed, it seems to us  a direct  conse-    quence of the creation of an Irish  Parlia-    ment that any  measure of  this character    must be  submitted to  the Irish Parliament    before it could be enforced on Ireland.&quot;   We desire to emphasise the fact that the above report  deals only with  one aspect of this very difficult and  important question, and that we. were  hot able in the  time then at our disposal to go into the possibilities of joint action  by a com-&quot;mori  War Couricilof  the two Governments, or as to  the  effect  of there being hereafter  a Federal Constitution for the  British Isles.             PART  II.-POLICE.  The second head of our reference  is concernedwith the future of the Royal Irish Constabularyand  the  Dublin Metropolitan Police.   The firstand  the  governing  question  is whether the  twoexisting Police forces in Ireland should  be placedunder the  control  of  an Irish Government, orshould,  as  in the ease of the Royal Irish Con-stabulary under the Government  of Leland Actof 1914,  be a reserved force to be under the Im-perial Government for a fixed period.  If an Irish Parliament and Government shouldbe created  with large powers of internal govern-ment,   an   independent  Exchequer  and  widepowers  of taxation,  it  appears to  us that specifi-^.cally to  except from its functions the  control ofPolice  would  produce  much  friction and lead tocontinuous effort on the part of the Irish Govern -ment to get  rid of the exception.  We cannot fail to recognise  that a good manypeople both in England  and Ireland regard withapprehension  the entrusting  to an Irish Govern -ment  in existing   conditions of the control ofpolice,  but  we think  that these apprehensionsmight  at least  be  modified  if it were  provided *that all  powers of appointment,  promotion&apos; anddismissal were vested  in  non-political Officers ofthe Grown.   Further we  think that control of theIrish police  by the Imperial Government in Lon-don  would have little  reality or  effective force.  The  Imperial Government could not interveneto prevent the Police carrying out laws  passed byan Irish Parliament, however much it might dis-approve  of them, and in matters of administra-tion and detail British Ministers  would in prac-tice  be dependent on their representatives in Ire-*land for  information and guidance, while to over-ride Irish Ministers and the  Irish Parliament onquestions of local administration  is a course theywould  be very unlikely to adopt.  We  have  therefore  come to  the  conclusionthat, if  the principle of a separate Irish Parlia-ment and Government be conceded, so essentialan  attribute of Government as the preservation jj.of internal order and the enforcement of law innormal conditions could hardly be withheld fromthe  Irish Government.  In case of any serious disturbance or outbreakinvolving the security and unity of the Realm,the  Military  forces of  the  Crown  under the*Imperial Government would be available for suchaction as might doe necessary.  While for the above reasons we think that thecontrol of  the Irish Police should  be  entrustedto the Irish  Government, it is a corollary of ourrecommendation that  those  forces  should  be^under the  direct authority of that  Government,apart from other reasons connected with adminis-tration and efficiency which  in our opinion makethis desirable  and to  which we  shall refer lateron in this report.   We  have  been  furnished  by  the Inspector-General of the Royal  Irish Constabulary and bythe  Chief  Commissioner of the  Dublin Metro-politan  Police with memoranda  as to  the con-stitution and  administration of  their  respectiveforces, and both these gentlemen  have  been goodenough  to attend  the Sub-Committee and  giv&apos;evidence before  it.    Their  memoranda, with anote of  their oral&apos;evidence, are annexed  hereto[Schedules  A. and B;]   We  desire  to make the following observationson these documents.*The paragraphs asterisked are dissented from by the Duke of Abercorn.  See his Reservation, p.
ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY.             STRENGTH OF  FORCE;  We  have no  suggestion  to  make as  to  thestrength of the  Force,    The Inspector-Generalhas  stated  his  views  thereon,  and we  see  noTea-son to question them.    Varying conditionsmay enable changes to be made and economiesto be  effected,  but these cannot at present  beforecasted, and  must  be  dealt  with from time-to time by those responsible for the Force.            BARRACKS RECRUITING.  Similarly, we  do. not think we can usefully sayanything  as  to  Barrack  accommodation or re-cruiting.  The latter must largely depend on theconditions of ihe moment.                     PAY.  The Pay is something less than that of EnglishPolice in  the industrial districts higher than insome  of  the  rural English  counties but  con-ditions differ, and we do not  think any usefulconclusions can be drawn from these  compari-sons.  Questions of  pay  must  be  open to re-consideration from time to time.  It should however be borne  in mind that theRoyal  Irish  Constabulary  perform  numerousduties in  addition to  police work, such as are notusually performed by  police forces  in  England.These indirectly reduce  the costs of other De-partments of Government.  W7e instance the following:              Agriculture.            Census.             Congested Districts Board.            Board of  Works.            Weights and Measures.            Food and Drugs.            Explosives Acts.            Petroleum.            Illicit Distillation?.            Fisheries.    ADVANTAGES OF CENTRALISED CONTROL.  On this  subject we beg leave  to refer to  theobservations  of  the  Inspector - General  (SeeSchedule A., pp. 70-71).  After consideration of these  observations, andthe first nine paragraphs of his  &quot; conclusions &quot;(see p. 72), and after his oral examination there-on, we are able to say that we concur in  theopinion he has  formed, and  consider  that  itwould be undesirable to make  any  substantialalteration of the present system of organisationand control  at  this time other  than would  beinvolved in  the transfer  of control from  theImperial to  the Irish  Government,  which  wehave  recommended  by  a majority of the Sub-Committee.PREVIOUS PROPOSALS AS TO  THE POSITION OF THE      FORCE UNDER AN IRISH GOVERNMENT.  These are  summarised   by  the  Inspector-General  (see pp. 71-72), so far as they affectedthe Royal Irish Constabulary,  but  we  do  notthink it would  serve any useful purpose for usto comment  on them in this report.    THE  IXSPECTOR-GEXERAT/S  CONCLUSIONS.  With regard to paragraph 6, col. 2, p. 72 of Sche-dule A, we assume that  if the control of the RoyalIrish   Constabulary is  entrusted to the IrishGovernment the funds  for  its maintenance  willbe  provided  from the frish Exchequer,  subjectto  the  special  local contribution for forces inexcess of the quota provided in particular locali-ties.  The question of amidgamation of  the DublinMetropolitan Police with the  Royal  Irish Con-stabulary is  dealt with  in the concluding para-graphs of Schedule A. (see p. 73).  This  may be  a  matter  for  consideration  atsome  future time,  if  experience leads  to  thebelief that it would be  of administrative advan-tage and would promote efficiency and economy,but at present there is no  demand  for  such ameasure, and we think its proposal at this timew7ould be  disturbing to the Dublin  force, andwould lead to  friction  and confusion.                             DUBLIN METRI  We have already said that, for the reasons givenabove,  this  force should,  in  our  opinion, passunder the control of the Irish Government, ifcreated, and be  carried  on under the same sys-tem of administration as it is at present, subjectto the  provision  that appointments, promotions,and dismissals  should be  entrusted  to  a non-political officer.   In practice this would probablymean  the  approval of submissions made to himby the Commissioners.  We. also think  for the reasons given  above thatthis is  not the time  to consider the question ofamalgamation with the Royal Irish Constabulary.  We  think  it right  to  call special attention tothe observation  of the  Chief  Commissioner  onthe question of Local Control&quot; (see Schedule B.,P- 73).   .  We   understand from  him  that though thegrievance  of paying rates without  control isexistent,  it  has  not assumed  any  acute form.                         * See the Reservation of tPOLITAN POLICE. We consider, however, that there is weight in his suggestion that the cost of this force should  be borne by the Irish Exchequer.   This would make it easier to effect amalgama- tion  with the Royal Irish Constabulary,  should that be thought  expedient at  any future time, and it would relieve the citizens of Dublin from a burden  which they may  not  unfairly deem in- equitable so long  as it is divorced from any form of local control.   It  is  to be observed  that if the Dublin rate- payers were relieved of this burden similar claims might be put forward by Belfast and Londonderry in respect of their payments for the  extra force of Royal Irish Constabulary permanently main- tained in  those towns.   There are some points in the memorandum of the Chief Commissioner on which  we desire to make suggestions.e Duke of Abercorn, p.
   We think it would be better that the Commis- sioners should be appointed by  the  Lord Lieu- tenant, with  a status similar to that of a Civil Servant.   Their appointment as Justices does not seem to  us necessary.   It  would  not often  be of advantage, and makes their position, as we think, somewhat anomalous.   We also think that,  as  we have suggested in the case of the Royal Irish Constabulary  appoint- ments, promotions and  dismissals should be sub- ject to the control of a non-political Officer of the Crown.               FINANCE CLERK.   We see no reason why this officer should be ap- pointed by the Lord Lieutenant, unless he  and not the Commissioner is to be responsible to the Government for financial administration.   Other- wise  we think that  he  should have the  position of a . Civil Servant of the Fust Division respon- sible  to the Chief Commissioner.  As  a general principle, we think the Head of a Department should  be  responsible for its finan- cial administration.   DUBLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE COURTS AND           DIVISIONAL MAGISTRATES.  We concur with the Chief Commissioner in hisopinion that the cost of the Dublin MetropolitanPolice Courts  and their  staffs and the salaries ofthe Divisional Magistrates should no longer becharged to the Police Vote.

We annex a  memorandum furnished by theHome Office, which  deals inter alia with certaindifficulties and  inconveniences arising from the.absence of any central control of police  forces inEngland.

PRESERVATION BY  THE DUKE OF                ABERCORN.  I am of  opinion  that the  Royal Irish  Con-stabulary  and the Dublin Metropolitan Policeshould both remain as reserved services under thecontrol of the Imperial  Government for at  leastsix years and for any longer period that the Im-perial Government may otherwise determine.                                  ABERCOKX.SUPPLEMENTARY  REPORT.  The above report having been presented to theGrand Committee we have been desired by thatbody to reconsider our Recommendations.  No particular points have been indicated  asthose which in the opinion of  the  Grand  Com-mittee call for reconsideration.  With regard to our report relating to Naval andMilitary  Defence  we  are unable  to  find anyreasons  which  in  our  judgment  would lead  usto alter our  recommendations  on  that part  ofour reference.  With regard to our report on  Pohce, the PrimeMinister, in his letter of the 25th February to theChairman of  the Convention  has stated that foradministrative reasons  it is  necessary  that thecontrol of Police forces in Ireland should be re-served to the Imperial authorities dining the war.  Although the  majority  of the Sub-Committeereported against the reservation to the  Imperialauthorities of such control for  a  specific period,as in the  Act of 1914, our recommendation wasgeneral in its character, and did not necessarilyexclude special conditions which might  postponethe  application  of the principle that  an IrishGovernment controlling local administration anda Parliament with complete legislative authorityin internal affairs should control the forces tomaintain  local order  and give  effect  to  locallegislation.  We recognise that it may be essential diningthe war, that Imperial control of Police should, foradministrative purposes,  be retained in  all partsof the British Isles.  We  may  add  that  our  recommendationsthroughout the report are based on the assump-tion of a Parliament within the Empire so con-stituted  as  to afford  security  for  steady andstable Government in Ireland.

291Schedule  I.MEMORANDUM . ON  THE QUESTION  OF  POLICE   ADMINISTRATION&quot;                       ..      AN  IRISH GOVERNMENT.   .UNDER(By  the  Inspector-General,  R.I.G.). -;For  the convenience  of the Sub-Committee I have in this memorandum  first examined  the system under which the Royal Irish  Constabu- lary, at the-present time, performs its  duties, in- eluding certain information  regarding  recruiting, pay, pensions,  &amp;e.   I  have then made a rough comparison  between centralised  and local. Police Forces. . Following on this, suggestions are put forward to meet the  present situation, in view of the con- templated change of government in  Ireland.   In making these suggestions I have touched  par- ticularly on  the question of  policing Belfast and Dublin.&apos;                             : .  I would submit, however, that in a short rne- morandum of this nature, it is impossible to give more   than   a   general outline  of the subject. Should the  Sub-Committee require  more  de- tailed information I would refer  them to the fol- lowing Blue Books, &amp;c.: &apos;    Evidence and Report,  R.I.C. Committee  of      Enquiry,  1914;    Annual  Reports of  H.M.

(John Kem-      ster, 8 Red Lion Square,  W.C.).            EXISTING SYSTEM.       (A). CONSTITUTION OF THE FORCE.  The  constitution,  strength, and distribution  of the Royal Irish Constabulary is  governed  and provided for, by a series of Statutes ranging from 6 &amp; 7  Win. IV., cap.  13, to the Constabulary and Police (Ireland)  Act, 1914.  The  statutory strength  of the Force is now 10,715  Sergeants, Acting-Sergeants,  and  Con- stables.  This  Force is allotted throughout  the country under three  heads: Free Quota, Extra Forces, and Reserve.  The  Free  Quota is that portion of the  Force which is wholly chargeable to the Constabulary Vote.   This force is allocated   to  the various Counties and Belfast, in accordance with a Sche- dule laid down  by the Lord Lieutenant in  Coun- cil under the Statute 48 Vic,   cap. 12.    This allocation  is made to meet  the  normal require- ments of the country, and is subject now  to re- vision at any time  under the Constabulary  andPolice. (Ireland) Act, 1914.  The last  allocationwas made  in 1909, and the number of Sergeants,Acting-Sergeants, and  Constables then allottedwas 9,303.           .-  ,  In addition to this Free  Quota, there  is  anExtra Force of  733  Sergeants,  Acting-Sergeants,and Constables  allocated to &apos;BeIfast-per 28  &amp;29 Vic, cap. 70, section 4, and 60 &amp; 61 Vic, cap.64, sec. 1.  Half the cost of this Force is chargedto Belfast.  A  similar  extra Force  of 14 menunder like conditions of charge is allocated toLondonderry under 33 &amp;&quot;34 Vic, cap. 83, sec 3.   There are also Temporary Extra Forces main- tained   (when  necessary) in  disturbed  areas. under 6 &amp; 7 Wm. IV., cap. 13, sec  12.   These Forces vary from time to time, and at the present time there is power to maintain  265 Sergeants,. Acting-Sergeants,  and  Constables  in  counties Clare and Galway  East and West  Riding, but the actual number of extra Police in these coun- ties is now only 110.  Half the cost of this extra Force is borne by the county or locality in which it is serving.   Then under 9 and 10 Vic, cap. 97, there is an authorised reserve of 400  Sergeants, Acting-Ser- geants, and Constables maintained at the Depot, Phcenix Park. When the Reserve are employed to police localities in the country, a moiety of the cost is chargeable to the counties or localities in which  stationed,  for so many  as  are employed therein and  for such a  time as they are absent on the duty.   There is power in the Executive at all times to move the Police from county to county, or from Reserve  to   counties  for  special  and  sudden reasons, and Police serving in a county other than their own are charged as to a moiety against that other county in respect- to the number employed over the Free Quota of that county.   The actual effective Force now serving, being the total of Free Quota, Extra Forces and Re- serve, including Recruits in training, is 9,238 Ser- geants, Acting-Sergeants and men.   There are  also 231 Head Constables serving, 4 of these being at Head Quarters, 8 at the Depot and on the Reserve,  and 219 in the country.   As regards Officers: there are on the Constabu- lary  List 240 Officers of all ranks,  including  1 Riding-Master and 1 Veterinary Surgeon.   As the Mounted  Force   has   now   been   practically abolished the Riding-Master and the Veterinary Surgeon will shortly vacate office,  thus bringing the effective strength down to 238.  Of this num- ber  81  are at present serving  in the  Army  and seconded, which  leaves 207 actually  engaged in police work,  i.e.,  14 at Head Quarters and  Re- serve, and 193 in the country  in charge of Dis- tricts and Counties.                (B). BARRACKS.  The Force is accommodated  in Barracks  and Huts, of which there are  close on 1,400 in the country, and the  supply  of barrack furniture, bedding, etc, as well as the rent of barracks, are chargeable to the  Constabulary  Vote,  but in re- duction of  this there is  a charge of Is. per week made to every man living in barracks. : The Barracks  are for  the  most  part  hired houses held either on a yearly  tenancy or under lease (usually for 21 years with power  to sur-render at 7 or 14 years) if the Station is likely tobe permanent.  In some cases it has been foundnecessary to build Barracks.  In these cases  theground rents are paid from the Constabulary Vote,the erection  and  maintenance  of  the buildingsbeing carried out by the Board of Wrorks. Ireland.In other eases old Military Barracks and disused                                     Q
Bridewells are  occupied by  the Constabulary,these  being  also maintained by the Board ofWorks.  Huts occupied by Constabulary are con-trolled by the Board of Works,  but the groundrents are chargeable to the Constabulary &quot;Vote.Where Barracks are held under yearly tenanciespr under lease the landlords for an inclusive rentas a rule undertake repairs, and pay all rates andtaxes.   The lighting, heating, and water supplyto Barracks is met by a scaled allowance whichvaries  slightly according to local circumstances.           (C).-WASTAGE  OF FORCE.  Taking an average  over the five  years  fromJanuary,  1912,  to December, 1916, the annualwastage  from all causes was 653; this  figure ishauch  below normal, owing  to  men being  re-tained in the Force for  the duration of the warwho are otherwise qualified to retire, and who aredesirous  of retiring, on  pension,  were they notprevented by the Police (Emergency Provisions)Act, 1915.              (D). RECRUITING.  The recruits for the R.I.C. are required to be5 feet 8  inches  in height;  36 inches mean chestmeasurement; of fair education; of the highestcharacter; aged  from 19-27 years, and physicallyfit.  The recruiting officers,  in  the first, instance,are the Sergeants in charge of the  Sub-districtsthroughout  Ireland;  before  being  sent  to theDepot for attestation and  training a recruit hasto satisfy the District  Inspector of his Districtand  the County  Inspector of his County, and willnot  be attested  even then until  he  also satisfiesthe Commandant at the Depot, and the Surgeonof the Force. . Formerly the  great source  of recruits was theyounger  sons  of farmers--this  class supplyingmen of superior physique  and intelligence, witha proper sense of pride of position and self-respect.Recently  this source of recruiting has not provedso fruitful,  the  reasons being in a sense eco-nomic.    Land  Purchase enabled the farmer togive his  elder son a profession, and then he  re-quired the younger to help  on the farm; further,the large  rise in wages in the  skilled trades madea policeman&apos;s pay look paltry, and the improve-ment  in  secondary  education opened  the  CivilService and other employments  to  the  farmer&apos;syounger son.   In addition to this, political unrest,especially where hostility  to   the  &quot;police   isapparent, often, for the  time being,  causes adiminution of recruiting.  The difficulty of obtaining  suitable  candidatesfor the Police exists not  only  in Ireland, but alsoin Great Britain (vide  Sir Leonard  Dunning&apos;sevidence  on page 210 of the Committee of En-quiry, 1914).  All recruits are trained  at the R.I.C. Depot.The period of training is about six  months, andthe  course  includes  Drill,  Ambulance Work,Swimming,   Physical  Training,  Pohce   Dut\7(theoretical and practical)  and Musketry.           (E).-PAY, &amp;C, OF R.I.C.   The Pay of the various grades of  the R.I.G. isfixed by  the Constabulary and  Police (Ireland)Acts,  1914 and  1916.   In addition to ordinarypay, War Bonuses have been granted from timeto time to meet the increased cost of living. i--. A Table  showing the  maximum  and mini-lhum rates of the R.I.C, compared with severalof the English Pohce Forces  is attached as aSchedule to this memorandum.&quot;  (See p.    ).  Any comparison between the Enghsh and IrishPolice Systems either as regards strength or ad-ministration is rendered difficult owing to the factthat the conditions obtaining  in the  two coun-tries are so wholly different in many respects.  In England there is an absence of agrarian orpolitical unrest, which so often in Ireland requiresthe rapid and frequent movement of extra bodiesof&apos;Pohce.    Also  in  England  active hostility i3rarely  shown to the  Pohce, who  can as a rulecount  on  the goodwill and  co-operation of  thepublic in the detection of crime, and in the main-tenance of law and order.  This goodwill and co-operation  permit of the employment  of isolatedpolicemen,  where  in Ireland a number of Con-stabulary would be required to police  an area ofthe same size or containing  the same population.  For  purposes  of  comparison  the  followingfigures with regard to  the  total effective  policeservices for the year  1913-14, which does not in-clude any of the abnormal conditions imposed bythe War,  might be of interest:                 FORCE.

The  annual cost of  a constable of the R.I.C. isestimated  at  95,  for the  purpose of essessingthe moiety to be chargeable to counties.    (F.).-THE DUTIES OF THE ROYAL IRISH                CONSTABULARY.  The  original  duties of the  Royal  Irish Con-stabulary are laid down in 6 Wm. IV., c. 13, butfor  many  years past their  duties  have  beensteadily increasing  alike  in  number  and variety.They  are a highly disciplined and well educatedbody of men, spread  over the  whole  face of thecountry, in a web  of  wdiich  every thread centresin Dublin.   It. is easy to set such a machine inmotion for almost  any purpose, and the  Govern-ment  taking advantage of this  has. from time totime  added much  to tho  duties,  of  the Force.which  now  does   work  for  practically  everyGovernment Department.  The  men employed in wrork  for other Depart-ments  are  not given  any extra pay, but merelysubsistence  and:,other  allowances,  under  theR.I.C. Regulations.  When considering the cost of the Royal IrishConstabulary-, therefore,  it is only reasonable to
29 set- against:this cost the expenditure which.would devolve  oh other; departments  were they called upon to provide  an extra staff .capable of coping&quot;with the&apos;work: now done on &quot;their behalf  bv the, E.I.C. --&quot;:  &quot;  &quot;-  &apos;  \   * -&quot; &quot; ;&quot;As an example&apos;of this,extra  work I would re- fer. td the assistance in numerous matters which is given to the Department of Agriculture-the^faking of the Agricultural&apos; Statistics being prob-&quot;ably the most laborious. &apos; In&quot; this connection I  invite the attention of the Sub-Committee to the evidence of Mr. T. P.  Gill, Secretary  of  the Department  of  Agriculture, in the  report of the E.I.C. Committee of Enquiry, page 310; ct  seq.  There is also the  Census, which is, in Ireland, entirely carried out. by the E.I.C, who also carry out  sundry enquiries on behalf of the Congested Districts Board  and of  the Board of Works.  Furthermore,  the Force performs  the  duty of the  inspection and verification of Weights  and Measures, receiving, only a nominal fee of  4 per inspector, whereas in England in the cases where the  police.are asked to undertake this duty  they receive very  much  higher remuneration.  Other instances are  duties under the Food and Drugs Act, the  Explosives Act,  the Petroleum Acts^  the suppression  of illicit distillation,   and the  enforcement of the Fishery Laws.     (G).-R.I.C. PENSIONS AND GRATUITIES.  The Pensions and Gratuities  payable to Mem- bers of the Force are governed by a long series of Acts of Parliament ranging from 6 Wm.  IV., cap. 13, to the Constabulary and Police (Ireland) Act, 1914, amended by 6 and 7 Geo. V., cap. 59. The following, however, are shortly  the  existing rules  governing pensions  to  Head Constables, Sergeants and Men.  A man wdien he  has completed 15 years&apos; ser- vjce becomes entitled to a pension under the fol- lowina; scale, if  retired as being  medicallv un- fit:-     On completion of 15 years  ...  15-50tlr of Pay     For  each  completed  vear       from 15-20 add     &quot;...   l-50th of Pay     For  each  completed  year       from 20-25 add     &quot;...   2-50th of Pay     For  each  completed  vear       from 25-28 add     &apos;.&apos;  ...   l-50th of Pay     On  completing  29  years&apos;      -service      ...    .  ...    frd of Pay   If injured in  the execution of his  duty a  man can be granted a special pension at any  service proportional to the  injury received.  The widows of men of 15 years&apos; service and over who die in the. Force can be  given pensions during widow- hood and allowances for each child up to 15 years of age.  Men who joined the Force prior to  1908 .may retire voluntarily at 25 years&apos; service, but their  pension will  be  calculated on  the  rates of pay fixed by  the Act of 1908.  Any man who has 30  years&apos; service and is 50 years of age may re- tire voluntarily on  his full pension of frd of his pay.   Men under 15 years&apos; service who become medi- cally unfit from causes not due to the execution of duty, may receive  a gratuity  of one month&apos;s pay for each year of service,  and widows  of men under 15 years&apos; service may be  given a similar gratuity.   An Officer is somewhat similarly  dealt  with, . except that  he  qualifies for  a pension when he has served 10 years, and cannot retire voluntarily until he has served 30 years,  when  he  receivesl-00th of his salary for each year of service;. heattains, his maximum pension, only  at  40 years&apos;service when he receives -frd of his salary.;&apos;  The Pension List of the R.I.C. is a high itemof cost.; in the year 1913-14 the total Constabu-lary Vote was  1,417,785, and pensions and gra-tuities absorbed  410,040, or almost one-third ofthis sum.           . .  Since 1914 the amount payable in pensions has.somewhat decreased, and in 1916-17 the pensionlist only absorbed   391,053 out  of a  total  ex-penditure  of   1,473,106.   This  decrease in pen-sions  is due to the fact that voluntary retirementson  pension  are  suspended-  during  the  war.When this restriction is removed the pension listwill increase even  above  the  pre-war  amountowing to the raising of pav granted by the Actof 1916. (H.) COMPARISON OF THE R.I.C. AS A CENTRALLY    CONTROLLED  FORCE  WITH  LOCALLY  CON-    TROLLED FORCES.  The  11.1.C.  is a  Centrally Controlled Forcedirectly  responsible  to,  and  working  in  close touch with,  the Executive; it is thus of thegreatest value in. promulgating and carrying out,with  the least possible delay-,  the orders of the-Government.-  The organisation of the R.I.C. has stood everytest and trial to which a police machine could besubject,  and it cannot be denied that it has  con-sistently and  honestly  carried  out the  duties allotted  to it by  the Executive.  Centralisation was not arrived at immediately, as there was for some time a  system of Provin-cial Inspectors-General,  but this was abandoned. and not reverted to.   For a  short period, some 25or 30 years ago, there was  a partial  reversion to decentralisation by the appointment of Divisional Commissioners  to deal  with certain classes ofpolice work in the provinces where  disturbance was rife, but they  ceased  to  exist  about  1898, and have not since been revived.   One disadvan- tage of  this system was the large increase of cor-respondence, and the uncertainty caused by  dual control.  Centralisation  is,  I understand,  largely aimed at in the formation of Colonial Forces, who often take  the R.I.C. as their  model their officers being trained at the Phoenix Park Depot.  Further, a  Centralised Force which, like the R.I.C., trains all its recruits in one place and on one model, ensures the  Pubhc more  even and more efficient service,  and, by  its system of drafting recruits to localities other than those in wdiich they Were born  and reared, reduces  to  a minimum any complaints of bias due to relation- ship  in  the locality.  The tendency in  England to-day, as regards Pohce  Forces,   is towards centralisation i.e., bringing the local forces more under the control of  the  Home Office.   This can be ascertained from the evidence of Sir Leonard Dunning, one of H.M. Inspectors  of Constabulary  in England,. in  the Report of R.I.C. Committee  of Enquiry,. 1914, pp. 210, et seq.  The Centralisation of a Force also makes for economy in administration, as  large contracts for uniform equipment, and the. many things univer- sally necessary  for a Police Force, can be  more cheaply made than those for small quantities, and there will  be more  uniformity  oft quality in the articles so  obtained.  The cost also of a centrally controlled force  can be more equitably distributed and the policeman will  cost the same wherever                                     Q 2
 stationed,  whereas in decentralised  forces  the cost varies  enormously, rates of pay  differ one force being thus kept  up to strength  with men of  superior  type,  while  in  the  same province another force granting lower wages can get men of only inferior type.         &quot;   Another advantage  which a centralised force possesses is  greater efficiency in the tracing  and apprehension of offenders, and in this connection I may mention that in England, as a step towards centralisation,  just before  the war- it was pro- posed to establish two clearing-houses for criminal information for all County  and Borough Forces; but, owing  to  the  war, the  scheme is in abey- ance.   The alternative to a centralised force is a foree locally controlled and  supported, to a consider- -able extent, by  local  taxation.   The model of such a force would be the  County and Borough Forces of Great Britain.  These forces have been established   under   certain  rules  ordained  by Statute from time  to  time.  One rule was that the proportion  of Police  to a population should be 1 to 1,000,  but  this proportion has  been long since  abandoned; and,  taking the whole  of Eng- land  and Wales, it  averages about  1  to  623. Another  rule,  which  is  still kept,  is that no borough  of  less  than  10,000 inhabitants  could have  a separate police force.   There are 207 boroughs of over 10,000 inhabitants in England, and of these. 180 have established separate forces, &apos;77 being content to be policed by the  County Force.   On  this standard, and disregarding Dublin and Belfast, there are 15 towns in Ireland qualified &quot;to have  separate forces - 6 of these being in Ulster.   On  the present  valuation, and  regard being had  to existing  rates  in those  towns, it is questionable  whether many of these would be inclined to  shoulder the  cost of a local police force, even  to  the  extent of  50 per cent.   The establishment of Local and County  Forces in Ireland would,  therefore,  mean a  very  large increase  in  local taxation,  and this  when the valuation of  the country  is much lower than in England.   In England and Wales,  without including Lon- ;don City and the Metropolitan Area, the rateable valuation per head of the population is  5  12s. 0d.   In Ireland, excluding the  D.M.P.  Area, the valuation per head  is  3.12s. Od.  The valuation of the Provinces being:         Leinster      ...... 4  18  0       Ulster       ...        ...   3  12  0       Munster      ...        ...   3  8  0       Connaught   ...        ...   2  8  0   The total  rateable valuation of  England and Wales, excluding London, is  162,257,595; while that of Ireland, excluding Dublin, is  14,893,930, or less than the combined valuations  of Liver-. pool,  Manchester, Birmingham,  and Leeds.   On such a restricted basis of taxation the cost of separate  police  forces would be prohibitive, and if Belfast  elected  to have a police force of its  own, the case  w?ould be  worse.   If the 15 towns  of over 10,000 inhabitants elected  to have separate forces, the problem  of rating the rest of the country for the supply of police forces would hardly be capable  of solution.   Financially,  therefore,  in Ireland a decentral- ised force would be the  case of many  difficult : problems.                                -   In  addition  to the  above, local police forces . would not be easily reinforced, and  the cost of reinforcement would lead to endless  bargainingand litigation, as scales of pay would cary aecord-ing to different areas.   Local forces would beslower in promulgating orders or information, andwould not be so prompt to act in the apprehen-sion of fugitive offenders.  There is a probabilityalso that the controlling bodies might raise diffi-culties  regarding orders  affecting  their  policeissued by  the  Central  Executive,  thus causingan order to be enforced in one area  and neglectedin another,  and resulting  in  confusion  and inwant of  uniformity.PREVIOUS  LEGISLATION  MEASURES  DESIGNED TO     MEET THE POLICE PROBLEM  UNDER AN ilush     GOVERNMENT.  With the establishment of a  separate Parlia-ment in Ireland, and an Executive responsibleto it, an entirely new problem  arises  as far asthe  R.I.C.  is  concerned.  This  Force  is, atpresent, an Imperial one, and paid from Imperialfunds;  the  amount of expense  entailed  on therates in Leland is, therefore, negligible.   Thequestion first  arose in connection with the HomeRule Bill of  1886, and Clause  21  (b) providedthat:-      &quot;The Royal Irish Constabulary shall, while     that force subsists,  continue and be  subject     as  heretofore  to  the  control  of  the Lord     Lieutenant as representing  Her Majesty.&quot;      (c)  &quot; The Irish Legislature  may  provide     for  the establishment and maintenance of a     police  force in counties  and  boroughs in     Ireland under the control of local authorities,     and arrangements may be made between the     Treasury  and the  Irish Government  for the     establishment  and  maintenance  of  police     reserves.&quot;There was no other  mention  of the R.I.C. inthe Bill.  The question  of control of the B.I.C.was,  however,  one of  the points  marked  foramendment by  Mr. Pamell (Hansard,  vol. 304,p. 1134).   The Bill never reached  Committee,and  no  schedules to it were  printed; but  thescheme  seems to have contemplated the gradualsubstitution of  the R.I.C. by local forces,  andthe  disappearance of&apos; the  former  by  naturalwastage all  the vested  interests as to pay andpensions being guaranteed by the. British Govern-ment.    No   representations  were  made   toGovernment on behalf of  either  officers or meu,because no  definite scheme was formulated asto their treatment under the Bill.  The next time the question arose was in  theHome Rule Bill, 1893.   This Bill contemplated-     (1)  The formation of County  and Borough          Forces by the Irish Parliament;     (2)  The  maintaining  for six years  of  the          R.I.C. under  the.control of  the Lord          Lieutenant;     (3)  The immediate cessation of recruiting;     (4)  The gradual withdrawal of the E.I.C.,          and,  when  local forces  were  estab-          lished, an option being given to meni-          bers  of the R.I.C. to join such local          forces;     (5)  Existing rights  as to pensions, salaries          arid emoluments of the  R.I.C. were          guaranteed by the British Exchequer:     (6)  The added service upon compulsory re-          tirement as compensation for abolition          of  office varied in the case of Officers          from ten to.twelve years.,  and was          ten years for the men;
.,..   (7) No allowance for increments which might           accrue during,the added years was to           be made in calculating pensions. These terms were fully discussed by both officers and.men,  and neither class was satisfied.   In introducing the Bill on 13th February, 1893, Mr, Gladstone said: -          The  principles which  we. recognise as     applicable to the consideration of the impor-     tant   question  connected  with  the Royal     Irish Constabulary are these :  Their gradual     reduction, their ultimate dissolution or  dis-     appearanee,   our  full  recognition  and  dis-     charge of  every obligation towards them in     such a way,  as I hope we shall see, that the     interest of that remarkable and  honourable     Force will not be  adversely affected in  the     passing of such a  measure  as that now be-     fore the House.&quot;   In the. opinion of  the officers and men then serving, in the Force this, as a sentiment,  was considered excellent, but  the performance they maintained fell far short of the promise, and the publication of Schedule VI. of the Act led to much  dissatisfaction.   Memorials  from both officers and men were submitted to Government, and a precis of  their  demands.was issued as a Parliamentary White Paper on 17th July, 1893.   The  Bill,  however,  not  succeeding  in  the House  of Lords, the matter  ended.   The next proposal in the nature  of Home Rule was the &apos;&quot;Irish Council&quot; Bill, 1907, and in  this the Royal  Irish  Constabulary was one  of  the Services excluded from the control of the Council.   The  Act of  1914 followed, and  as this is on-the Statute Book, and was thus fully considered and debated upon inT)oth  Houses of Parliament, where due weight was. no  doubt, given to  the provisions and defects of  the previous Bills, it may be  urged  that the  Sections of  this  Act- dealing  with  the R.I.C.  are  worthy  of  the highest,  consideration.   Moreover, the  Clauses and  Schedules of the  Bill  were  very  carefully considered by  two Committees elected  to repre- sent one the officers,  and  the  other, the men. Their ideas  were laid  before Air. Birrell,  who paid  due  regard to  them,  and  made  several amendments  in  the  Clauses and  Schedules in accordance with the  recommendations  of  the Committees.  As a result. Clause 37 and Schedule IV. were included, and Clause 5 of the Act lays down a transitional period of 6 years,  from  the &quot; appointed day,&quot; during which the R.I.C.  was to remain under the Imperial Government, thus following the precedent set  forth  in the  Bill of 1893.                CONCLUSIONS.  Having now outlined the existing organisation,etc., of the R.I.C., and having &quot;compared  therelative merits and demerits of&quot; the CentralisedForce with the  system which  obtains in GreatBritain  at the present  time,  it only remains forme to  put  forward some  suggestions  for  thefuture,  assuming that  Ireland  will be governedby  a  Governor-General  with  a Central Parlia-ment,  and  not  by a &apos;  Governor-General  withProvincial Parliaments.  In the first place, I submit that it is so impos-sible to forecast what the future attitude of  thepopulation  will be  towards  the maintenance oflaw  and order that, in my opinion, it would beexcessively,  dangerous even to attempt, at thepresent time, to formulate any scheme involvinga radical change in the  police system  as it nowexists in this country.-  I would, therefore, urge in the  strongest man-ner possible that, for a transitional period of, say,six years (this being the period that  was foundsuitable both in 1893 and again in 1914) no radicalchange  be made  in the  organisation  or in thegeneral principles  under which the R.I.C. is nowadministered.  The  present system, I would point  out, will,during  this  transitional  period,  admit of anyeconomies which  may be considered  necessary.Such economies can be effected by the abolitionof recruiting; by the grouping together of countiesor districts for administrative purposes powerto do so having been given by the Police Act of191-1; also,  should it be found during  this tran-sitidnal period that an armed  force is  no  longernecessary, the training of recruits  in the handlingcf arms  can be abolished.  At the end of this period of six years, we  shall,I expect and  hope,  be in a position to ascertainaccurately whether a complete change  of systemis possible or desirable; and, if so, which systemwill be most suit-aide to the needs of the country.  In  making  these suggestions  regarding theretention of the R.I.C. for a transitional period,I do not feel that I am competent or qualifiedto offer  any opinion on  the question  as to whoshould exercise supreme  control over the Force.I  woidd  urge, however,  that, in the event ofsuch supreme control being placed&apos; entirely inthe hands of the Irish Parliamentary Executive,then,  on  any  matter  adversely affecting thevested iuterests of an officer or man in the Force,such officer or man should have a right of appealto the Governor-General.  I also feel that I am  not competent nor in aposition  to  offer any  suggestions or recommen-dations as to the source from which the fundsnecessary  for  the  maintenance  of  the  Forceduring this transitional period should be derived that is to say, whether they should be providedfrom the Imperial, or from the Irish, Exchequer.  Not  only for the  reasons which I have  givenabove do I consider it necessary that the existingorganisation, etc., of the R.I.G. should not, forthe present, be interfered  with; but  there areother and Arery important  reasons for adoptingthis  course, which I think cannot be overlooked.  In the  first  place, during the  difficult periodof the  change from one  form  of Government toanother,  the new Government will find it of thegreatest  advantage to have to its hand a highlyorganised and efficient machine like the R.I.C.;for example, the work of every large GovernmentDepartment is, as I have previously stated, to agreat extent interlocked  with the R.I.C.,  anduntil those Departments, under changed controland  organisation,   are  in running  order,  theywould,  I think, find it  difficult to  undertakethat portion of  their duties which is  now  doneby the Force.  It may not be out of place here to put forwarda-  few  general  remarks  regarding the BelfastForce and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  The  former  Force, amounting to,  roughly,1,200 men,  is  provided  by the R.I.C., and, inmy opinion,  at least for the transitional period,it  would be  very  unwise to interfere  with thisarrangement.
   Belfast  obtains&apos;  many-  advantages from-the&quot;-present system, amongst which I may^mention- the following :   .     (1) None  but  trained and picked men  are            sent to  Belfast.   A candidate for  the            city  force  must  have  probationary            service in the country before his case&apos;            is considered.     (2) Any man found unsuitable for the city            force  may be  re-transferred to  the            country.   Service  in Belfast  is  so            popular  that  this  regulation  proves       ,     itself to be a very considerable aid to            discipline.    &apos;. (3) The proportion  as between religious  de-            nominations,   which  is  essential  in            Belfast, is more easily maintained by            drafting men from the Force at large. .         -  The  supply of Protestant  recruits is,            I fear, diminishing; and though efforts            have  been made  to stimulate it,  I            cannot  say that we are meeting with            any satisfactory success.     (4) At present no man is selected for duty            in Belfast who is  locally connected.            This  is  a  very great advantage  for            insuring impartial  police  administra-            tion.     (5) The Commissioner at  Belfast  works in            close  touch  with  the  Police  Com-            mittee  of  the  Corporation.    From            interviews I have had with that Com-            mittee,   and  from  reports  which  I            receive  from time to time, the Com-            mittee appear to be  entirely satisfied            with the  existing arrangements.    As  regards the  D.M.P.,  the question of  the  amalgamation  of this Force with the R.I.C.  was  touched on by Mr. Headlam, Treasury Remem-. brancer, .in his Minority Report&quot; of- the R.I.G. Committee of Enquiry, 1914, page 35.  He stated there that the  maintenance  cf the. separation of the  two  Forces was due  to historical  reasons. This mav  be true, but in a very slight degree The D.M.P.  differ from the  R.I.C. in their con- dition of service, organisation, rates  of  pay  and pensions,  and also in the nature of their duties, and the  manner, of  performance.  Their powers also are  in many respects, different,  and based on  local  statutes,  and for  these. reasons amalga-. mation  would   be   exceedingly  difficult.    Mr. Headlam &quot;s views, I  may add, did not meet with the approval of his  colleagues, Sir David Harrel and Mr.  R. F.  Starkie both of whom have very great police and administrative experience in Ireland.   My own opinion is that, at least for the tran- sitional period, no  such  amalgation should be attempted.   It at  the  end of  this period  any radical  change  in the whole police system  is &quot;found to  be  desirable, then  the relationship be- tween these- two Forces can be  reconsidered.   In conclusion, I  would call  attention to the safeguards of the interests  of both  officers  and men laid down in the Act of 1914. In my opinion no  safeguards less advantageous than those could, or should be, offered to the members  of the Force in any7 subsequent legislation. I will, however, as the scheme  adopted by the  Convention assumes a  more  definite form, assemble committees  of both officers and men to advise me  in regard to these matters; this  is following the precedent  of 1893 and of 1914.

NOTE II. Notes of the Oral  Evidence of the  Inspector-General  E.I.C.THE AUTHORISED STRENGTH  OF THE  FORCE  was  normally sufficient.  At present the Royal Irish  Constabulary  were  called  upon to  perform  numerous additional duties in connection with  Food  Control, the Defence of the Realm, etc.,  and, on account of the number of men absent  on  military service  and other  vacancies, the  existing  strength  was scarcely sufficient&apos; to  meet  the  demands made upon them.BELFAST was at present entitled to a &quot; Free  Quota &quot;  of 500  Police  (Sergeants and  Con-  stables).    Its authorised &quot;Extra Force&quot;  was  733.  The actual strength  at the present time  was,  however, only 1,120.  Half the cost of .the Extra Force was  chargeable on the  local  Rates.  The present charge (for a moiety of  616 men)  was about  29,400 per annum.  This  sum  includes  a  certain  charge for  &quot; night  watch duty, and  a contribution of  400  to-  wards the Town Inspector&apos;s salary.  In Dublin  a Police Bate (fixed by Statute) is levied in  respect of the whole Police Establishment.    In addition to the &quot;free  Quota&quot; of Sergeants  and Constables  mentioned,  Belfast has  also,  free of charge, the  services of 7 District In-  spectors and 28 Head Constables.    There has been no direct local control  since  the policing of the  City  was handed over to  the Royal Irish Constabulary, in 1865, by the  28  &amp;  29 Vic, cap.  70.  There  is, however, a  local  Police Committee  of the  Corporation,  who from time to ,tinre make  suggestions as  to local Police arrangements through the Town  Inspector, for the Inspector-GeneraFs approval.  The power of this  Committee  is purely con-  sultative as regards the disposition and employ-  ment of the City Force.  The relations between  it  and the Town  Inspector   are  invariably7  harmonious.    It has been usual for several years to address  the Town  Inspector as the &quot;Commissioner of  Police, Belfast, but he is under the control of  the Inspector-General, like an ordinary County  Inspector, having, however, a larger salary.    The Act  quoted above provides  that &quot; the  Officer of  the  Constabulary Force  in Belfast  shall  consist of one  Inspector,  who shall rank  as a County Inspector of Constabulary, and be  called the Inspector of Constabulary for the  Town of Belfast.&quot;&quot;TEMPORARY  EXTRA FORCES.&quot; These are  men  taken  from the Reserve  Force  or  otherwise,  and drafted when necessary to disturbed or  proclaimed  counties.   The  Reserve Force is  kept at the Depot.  Counties are only charged  for men in excess of  their free quota.    The  Constabulary Statutes give authority to charge  an area, which might be smaller than a county,  with half  the cost of the extra pohce sent there  on  account of disturbance.ASSISTANCE   TO  DUBLIN. No  inconvenience  re-  sulted from the only recent occasion when the  R.I.C. were detailed for duty in Dublin during  the labour  dispute  in 1914.  The  R.I.C. de-  tachments  then worked under the orders of  the Chief Commissioner of the  Dublin Metro-  polifcan Police, but he was somewhat  doubtful  as  to  whether the  R.I.C.  as  such have  any  legal  status in the D.M.P. area.RECRUITING has been stopped from time to time  for periods as long as two years; for instance,  when the Wyndham Act  was passed; but it-  had to be resumed, and it was found that  the  recruits then obtained were not up to the usual  standard, as the same  care in selection could  not be exercised owing to the necessity of rapid  completion of the numbers.    The present class of  recruits was up to  the  standard, but. there wTas  greater  difficulty in  obtaining them.PAY. The Force was  not  attracting  as many  recruits as it formerly did. This was possibly  due to the fact that other calhngs were more  attractive.   Two shillings  extra per wreek w7as  granted to men serving in Belfast and Derry,  and slightly larger lodging  allowance is payable  to married men serving in those two and in  certain  other large towns.  The adequacy or  otherwise of  the pay was a difficult matter on  which to express an immediate opinion. There  is a  continual tendency to  raise the  pay of  other police forces, and the R.I.C. had to  fall  into line; also the cost and standard of living  varied from time to time.THE FORCE WAS  GENERALLY POPULAR,  but some-  times, and in  some localities, political excite-  ment caused temporary  unpopularity.  This  was the case  at  the  present  time in a  few  countiss.TRAINING was both civil and  military, a consider-  able portion of the time  being spent  on  the  civil training.&apos;  Drill was now7 part of the train-  ing of  all  Pohce  Forces.   The  R.I.C.  w7as  trained to use rifles, and in this respect differed  from  the Dubhn  Metropolitan Pohce.  (The  latter was  now, he understood, trained in  the  use of revolvers).   The military  training  did  not interfere with  the  civil  training,  but  the  period of training was,  he thought,  somewhat  longer than in England.ADDITIONAL DUTIES. These  duties brought  the  Force into touch  with  the  people  and gave  them knowledge and experience.   He  w7as  not.  in favour of limiting the Force to purely police  duties.COLONIAL POLICE OFFICERS were, before the war,  sent to be trained at the Royal Irish Constabu-  lary Depot on account  of  the high reputation  of the R.I.C. as an efficient and fully trained  Police Force.LOYALTY OF THE FORCE. He had no fear regard-  ing the  loyalty of the  Force  towrards   the  authority set over them.THE QUESTION  OF LOCALISATION. He believed  that the establishment  of local forces would  be a retrograde step.  There were great advan-  tages in the existing power of transferring men  from one place to  another.  It w7as a rule that  no  officer or man  was ever sent to his owrn  locality.   The establishment of local forces  would involve  a charge upon  local rates  for  their  maintenance   wholly  or  in  part.   At  present, outside Dubhn, Belfast and Derry, all  localities (urban and rural) have a fully-equipped  and trained police force, sufficient  for normal  requirements, without any cost whatever.    No  demand for local control had come to  his  knowledge.
295PROMOTIONS AND DISMISSALS. Promotions rested  with the Inspector-General; Dismissals  with  the  Lord Lieutenant.DETECTION OF  CRIME. In the rare cases where  crimes in the country required special detective..  work,  detectives&apos; were. sent  from Belfast.  There was  a staff of plain-clothes  detectives  also at certain other of the large towns,  such  as  Cork, Limerick,  Waterford.   These  men  were available for detective duty.   There was  no  local jealousy in  such cases.UNIFICATION OF  IRISH POLICE. There was no.  reason why  Dublin should not be  policed by  the  B.I.C.   He  believed that  after a time it  might be an advantage to  have one force for  the  whole of Ireland, but an immediate amal-  gamation would, he  thought,  only  dislocate   both forces,  and it,  therefore,  should not be...  attempted  during the transitional  period; not   only were  the  rates  of pay  of the two forces   different, but the officers above  the rank of   Sergeant were  differently  graded. SAFEGUARDS IN THE ACT OF  1914.- He regarded   these as satisfactory, but he understood that   the opinion in the force had been that officers   and  men should, in addition,  be given the   right to  immediate  retirement  with compen-   sating  service towards pension. CONTROL. Assuming an Irish responsible  Gov-   ernment,  he considered  that  the Minister   responsible for the peace of the country should   have the power to move and utilise the police   at his discretion.Schedule  B.MEMORANDUM  ON  THE  DUBLIN  METROPOLITAN  POLICE.(By the Chief Commissioner).    The Constitution  of the Dublin  Metropolitan  Police is dealt with in various statutes, the principal  being 6 &amp;  7  Wm. IV. C. 29.    The Commissioners are not  members  of  the&amp; force.   They are &quot; Justices ;&apos;  appointed  by  the  Lord Lieutenant under 6  &amp; 7  Wm. IV., C.  29,  *&apos; to execute the duties of Justices  of the Peace......  together  with  such other  duties  as  shall be from time to time directed by the Chief-&apos; Secretary  .   .   .  &apos;.   or in his absence the Under  Secretary.&quot;  .   .  .    For salaries see Note II.  (1).    Members of the Pohce  force  are appointed  by  the  Chief  Secretary  or in his absence  by  the  Under Secretary.    The powers and duties  of the  Dublin  Metro-  politan Police are generally similar to  those of  other  Police forces  but they  also  act  under  a  number of  special enactments affecting the Dublin  Metropolitan Police District,    The strength of the force is not fixed by Statute.    The Chief Secretary or Under Secretary  has  power,  under 6  &amp; 7  Wm. IV., to  appoint  &quot; a  sufficient number of fit and able men.  .   .  .&quot;&apos;    The appointment of all  constables must  receive  the  formal  approval  of the  Chief or  Under  Secretary.    The maximum strength  up to which the Chief  or Under Secretary has authorised the force to be  recruited is as follows :              1  Chief Superintendent,             6 Superintendents.            25 Inspectors.            42 Station  Sergeants.           148 Sergeants.            18 Detective Officers.           979 Constables.            36 Supernumeraries.    There is,  therefore,  nominal authority for  a  strength of  1,252, but the Treasury provide for  payment of  1,201 only.    The latter figure  is,  therefore,  the   real   strength  at  which it is  endeavoured to maintain the force.    *                     PAY.  The pay  of the forceNote  (Note II.

EXPENSES  OE POLICE ESTABLISHMENT.  The joint expenses of  Dublin  MetropolitanPolice Establishment and Police Courts are borneby :-      (a) Parliamentary Vote.      (b) Appropriations in  Aid.  The latter item is composed of receipts from :     .  1. Police Tax.      2. Fines  and Fees.      3. Carriage Revenue.      4. Publicans&apos; Fees.      5. Pedlars&apos;  Fees.      6. Incidental Income  (Payments for Police             employed by  private  persons sale             of cast uniform, &amp;c).  A Note (Note IV.) is attached showing expendi-ture  under the various sub-heads  and  amountsreceived  as above.  The Police Tax,  which is  the principal item ofthe &quot; local contribution &quot; is the proceeds of a ratelimited  to a maximum of  8d. in the    on  thevaluation  of   the  Dublin  Metropolitan  PoliceDistrict.    The  tax  is  now collected b)-  the  Cor-poration as regards the City, and by the CountyCouncil  as regards the  portion  of  the DublinMetropolitan Police District which  lies outsidethe City.  Before leaving the question of Finance, I shouldlike to draw attention to the fact that the expensesof the Police Courts are included in the DublinMetropolitan Police Vote.   Such an arrangementobtains, in no other city,  so far as I am aware,and except that it is hallowed by long precedentin Dublin  has  nothing to commend  it.   In  myopinion  there is something  almost objectionablein the fact that the Commissioner of Police shouldbe  the officer  responsible for  paying the Magis-trates before  whom he prosecutes.   The Com-missioner has, however, no control whatever  overthe Police Court Staff, although their salaries arepaid  by  him.    The alliance is an unnatural  one,and should not, I  think, be perpetuated.  The foregoing deals  generally with the questionregarding the present  constitution, pa)&apos;,  position,and functions of the Dublin Metropolitan Police,and I now come to the question  of their controland organisation under a  S3rstem  of Self-Govem-ment.  The transfer of  the  Dublin Metropolitan Policefrom  Imperial  to  Irish control must, I  suppose,be  regarded as inevitable.  To  hand over  control to  the  local  authoritywould, however, in the first instance,  at any rate,be injudicious.  No doubt, with the precedent  of  the sj-stemin  Great  Britain  before  them, the  Irish  localauthorities will  ultimately seek such control.  I am  not at  all sure that this  system of localcontrol is a perfect one, but I am convinced  thatat the outset of the new scheme of Government,the better plan would be to vest the control of thePolice in the Department which  will correspondin Ireland to the Home Office across the  Channel.  I am influenced in great measure in my view asto future organisation  of the Dublin MetropolitanPolice by  the following consideration.  A  radical change in the system of Governmentmust entail a period of miavoidable confusion, untilthe various branches of the new executive gain thenecessary  experience to ensure smooth  working.Above  all  things at  such a time it is  essentialthat the machinery fc enforcing law and preservingorder should be as little mteiitutsd with as possible3  It must be borne in mind that the Dublin M tro-politan Police are now  performing a number ofimportant duties outside ordinary police work -_    (a) Enforcement of Defence of the Realm Act.    (6) Enforcement of Aliens Restrictions Orders.    (c) The  carrying out  of  the  complicated         system of Food Control.    (d) The Petrol  Restrictions  Orders.    (e) The procuring of Statistics for the Depart-         ment of Agriculture and Technical  In-         struction.  I am, therefore,  strongly  of  opinion that saveas regards the  change  of supreme control fromImperial  to Irish  hands, if decided upon,  theexisting police system should remain unchanged.  Alterations may be subsequently introduced asoccasion  requires,  and  opportunity  offers,  butthese should be effected gradually and with  duecaution.  It may be appropriate to  remark here  that thequestion of  local control has always been  a some-what thorny one as regards the  Dublin Metro-politan Police.  The citizens pay in  rates a considerable sumtowards the upkeep of the force, but have uo sharewhatever in its  management.   On the  Englishsystem the  citizens  would probably have to paymore,  but the  control of the Force would be intheir hands.  Moreover, elsewhere in Ireland,  the ratepayersfor the most part  pay  nothing for their Police,while in those  cities where the &quot; free quota &quot; ofpolice  is sufficient,  the  local contribution is  notnearly so heavy as in Dublin.  This  differential  treatment undoubtedly givesthe  Dublin  ratepayers  some  grounds   for dis-content.  It would, I think, be desirable that this grievanceshould be removed.   I  would suggest that whilethe control  of the  Police is in  the hands of  theCentral Government the local contribution (PoliceRate)  might bo dispensed with, the  cost of  thePolice being borne  upon the Exchequer.  The cost would then be borne by the communityat large and would fall on all alike.  The  suggestion   has  occasionally been  putforward that amalgamation of the two Irish PoliceForces would have good  results, economically andotherwise.  I cannot, however, concur in this view.  Police work in Dublin  has  always been a matterof exceptional difficult)&apos;,  and demands an adminis-tration materially different in character from thatsuitable for the rest  of Ireland.  Dublin is  not  only the seat of Government, butis the natural  centre of most  of  the importantpolitical and labour  organisations.  Activities ofthis kind must always be  matters  of  serious andspecial consideration for those responsible for  thepeace  of the City.  A City  Police  Force must  necessarily haveentirety different characteristics from those of arural  force,,  but even in the case of the  City ofBelfast, the only city in Ireland where conditionsare at all  approximate  to  those in Dublin, thenecessity for exceptional  treatment and specialisedadministration is not so apparent as in Dublin.  Dublin is  the last place in  which experiments insuch vital matters as enforcement of law  and thepreservation of public order should be attempted,particularly, as I have said before, at a time whenthere  must Jbe confusion and possibly excitementand unrest among the people-
  The Royal Irish Constabulary is a seini-inihtaryforce, while the Dublin Metropolitan Pohce, on thecontrary, is a purely Civil Force.   Such a radicalchange might  not meet with the wishes of thecitizens of Dubhn, while the Dublin MetropolitanPohce would bitterly resent their  abolition quaDubhn Metropolitan Police.  AU other considerations apart, it seems to me,however, that  since  the  various local authoritiesmay possibly ultimately acquire control over thep0fice following the English practice-it wouldbe futile  to take the. serious and doubtful step ofamalgamating the two forces, with the consequentupset of  existing machinery when the necessity7for again establishing a  Dublin  Force may: arise-within a  comparatively short period.  I  have not  in  this  Memorandum  made anyrepresentations as  to the effect upon the interestsof the Force and Staff which a transfer as outlinedwould have.  When the Home Rule Act was underdiscussion the Force were permitted to place theirviews before the Chief  Secretary,  a course whichwas  also follwed by the Commissioners and Staff.It would, I think, be premature, at the presentmoment, to prepare similar  memoranda, but nodoubt, an opportunity will be afforded them to doso, when the details of any new scheme are madepublic  and  before action is  taken to give legaleffect to it.

                                       NOTE  V.NOTES  OF  THE  ORAL EVIDENCE  OF  THE  CHIEF COMMISSIONER  OF THE                         DUBLIN  METROPOLITAN POLICE.  The Chief Commissioner was appointed by theLord  lieutenant.    He held office at pleasure,retired at 65, and was a Civil Servant.  By  Statute  he was  a Justice of the Peace.He knew of no special reason why  this should beso, but it may have been to meet special emer-gencies.    For instance, he could read the  RiotAct.    As  a Justice of the Peace  he could  signwarrants,  and  was  accustomed to sign  pensionpapers, but that&apos; was all.   He agreed that it wouldbe a anomaly if it were possible for him to  signa warrant,  order an arrest, and try the case, butthis could not happen in Dublin, as Justices of thePeace did not sit to try cases (s.  1, 6 &amp; 7 Wm.IV.: c. 29, last paragraph).  As regards LOCAL  CONTROL, he  did not considercontrol by a Watch Committee to be a good system.It weakened the responsibility and disciplinarypower of  the  Commissioner.    Members of theWatch Committee were liable to be interested inmatters coming under police control, for instancepublichouses.  PROMOTIONS AND  DISMISSALS  were  under hiscontrol.    There was no appeal in  the  case ofdismissal, but he might be overruled by the ChiefSecretary.   He saw no objection to giving a  rightof appeal to the Chief Secretary.  THE STRENGTH OE THE FORCE was, generallyspeaking, sufficient.  PAY was a little higher than in the R.I.C.  Anincrease was under consideration.   It was lowerthan in a  large English town like  Manchester.The minimum was slightly lower,  the maximumconsiderably lower.  THE STAFF was sufficient, not excessive.  CONTROL. The D.M.P. should remain under thecontrol of the Central Government  as in the  caseof the London Police.  THE COST OF THE D.M.P. should be borne whollyby  the Exchequer, as long as  central  controlcontinued.   He did not think the desire for citycontrol was strong enough to make the city willingto bear the whole cost of the police.   There hadbeen no agitation for this  change, but  objectionwas almost invariably taken to paying the existingpolice rate.   He was not in favour of partial localcontrol.  THE QUESTION OF  AMALGAMATION WITH THER.I.C.-Throwing the  whole cost of the  D.M.P.on the Exchequer  would not  imply that thereshould be one Police force for all Ireland.   Dublinneeded a separate force.  In cases where assistance was required from theR.I.C., the Inspector-General was applied to, andthe consent of the Government  obtained.   Therewas no difficulty.   No special payment was madeto the R.I.C.    It did not fall on the Dublin ratesbecause the Police rate was always at its maximumof M.  There might be some gain in financial simplicityin having a single force for Ireland,  but this didnot weigh against the  disadvantages.   The changewould be  unpopular.    Dublin  was not like Bel-fast.   There  were  many political  and  socialdifferences.   It was tnie that there were strongerlabour organisations in Belfast and more  socialism,and  in this sense a greater contrast with ruraldistricts than existed in Dublin, but the temperamcnt of Dublin was peculiar.   There were secretpolitical associations and the authorities were nosupported in the same way.  An unified  Police  force  might facilitate  theinterchange of forces for special  emergencies and asingle detective force  might be more efficient forthe detection of crime, but these advantages didnot warrant unification.   At present the D.M.P.detective  force  worked  only in its own area.The R.I.C.  force at Belfast was separate.  The D.M.P. men were of the same c&apos;ass as in theR.I.C., mostly farmers&apos; sons, small  shop-keepers&apos;sons,  &amp;c.    There was no system  of  placingProtestant? and Catholics in separate districts.Schedule  C.POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND  AND  WALES.  Questions  were addressed  to the  Home Officeupon various points in connection with the con-stitution and administration of Police Forces inEngland  and  Wales.    A  communication wasreceived in reply, giving answers to the questionsasked, and referring in certain passages to (1) Aprinted Memorandum issued in 1900 on the PoliceForces ;  (2) A volume of &quot; Home Office Circulars &quot;,(3)  The  Official  Blue  Book  on Police for 1914;copies of all  these documents being enclosed.  The questions, with  the answers made to them,are set out in order below,  and. for conveniencenotes have been added, where necessary,  givingextracts or figures from the documents referred toin the text.  QUESTIONS 1 and 2. What are the relations ofCounty and Borough Police Forces to  the HomeOffice&quot;?  What are the powers of County  and BoroughCouncils  over the  Police Forces, and  to  whatextent, if any. do these powers extend bejrond theborders of the Borough or County ?  ANSWERS 1 and 2. The Annexed Memorandumon the Police forces of  England and Wales shows(1) the relations betweon the Home Office and theCounty and  Borough Forces,  and  (2)  the legal
position of the local authorities in regard to theseforces.    Attention is specially  directed  to  themarked  passages. *   * NOTE. The marked passages are as follows :             COUNTY CONSTABULARY^    For each adnunistrative county there is a forcegoverned by  a Chief  Constable, who  appointspromotes, and dismisses the other members of theforce, and  has the general government of themsubject to  the authority of the  Standing JointCommittee, which is  composed half of  represen-tatives of  the Justices assembled   in  Quarter-Sessions the former Police authority of the county and  half  ot  representatives  of   the  County&apos;Council, the administrative body created  by theLocal Government Act,  1888.  The Standing JointCommittee  appoints the Chief  Constable  subjectto the approval of the  Secretary&apos; of  State.   Thecounty forces  were established between  1839 and1856 under the direct supervision of  the  Secretaryof State.  Any change in the number of any7 county7force is subject to  his approval ;  he is empoweredto make rules for  their  pay7, clothing and govern-ment.  Plans for county7 pohce stations are subjectto his approval. The cost of the force is borne bya local rate.    Special  districts  requiring specialpolice protection  can be  rated separately7.  AnExchequer  contribution amounting  to half thepay7  and clothing  of  the force is made from theproceeds of certain Imperial  revenues allocatedfor this  and other local purposes.   This is, how-ever, subject to an annual  certificate given by7 theSecretary of  State that the force is efficient ;  ifthe  certificate is refused the Exchequer contribu-tion  is forfeited.   There  are now  sixty7 county-forces.   Counties, hke the Metropolitan  Pohcedistrict, are divided into divisions ;  at the  headof the men in each division there is a superinten-dent. The divisions  usually7 correspond with the Petty7 Sessional Divisions formed for the purposes of magisterial jurisdiction.&quot;                BOROUGH POLICE.   &quot; Every7  municipal  borough is, as a general rule. required to establish a separate force  of pohce. An  arrangement can, however, be made with the police  of  the  county7  in  which  the borough  is situated for  policing it, and this is done in the majority7 of  cases.    Further, boroughs  Avith  a population of less  than  10,000 Avere wholly merged in the county for police  purposes  by7  the  Local Government Act,  1888, and no new force can  be established for a  borough  haA7ing a  population of less than 20,000 at the date of its incorporation. There are  UOAV 127 boroughs with separate pohce forces.   The  force is managed by7 a Watch  Com- mittee,  which is a committee of the TOAATI Coimcil elected  annually7: they appoint the  Chief  Con- stable, and also the  other members of the force. The cost is  defrayed from local funds,  but the Imperial  Government  makes  an annual  contri- bution to  the amount  of  one-half from the  same source,  and on the same conditions as in the case of  county constabulary.    For this  purpose  a certificate  cf efficiency from the Secretary7 of  State is required,  as in the  case  of the county7 con- stab vdary.&quot;   &quot; Members of  the County7 and Borough  forces and of the  Metropolitan  Police  haA7e a right to pension under the Police Act,  1890 ;  and, as a contribution towards the pension funds estabhshedfor each force under the Act, a  yearly  sum of 300,000 is  distributed from Imperial revenuesubject to  a certificate from the Secretary of theState that  the management of the force and of itsfund  has been  satisfactory during the year.&quot;   QUESTION 3. HOAV does the Home  Office main-tain  unity  of administration in  Pohce  mattersthroughout the country ?   ANSWER 3. The  Home Office can  secure somemeasure of  uniformity in Police  administrationby its statutory  authority.*  For instance, it canintimate that a force will not  be certified  efficientand will lose its share of  the Exchequer contri-bution unless it reaches a certain standard  in pointof numbers, discipline  or management.   The ap-pointment  of women  to  take charge of femaleprisoners and (at some places) the proper equip-ment  of mounted police has  been insisted on  inthis way7.  It is found, hoAveA7er, that Chief Officersof Pohce and local Police authorities are generally-ready7 to adopt the Home Secretary&quot;s reconnnenda-tions without actual compulsion being exercised.Examples  of this Avill be  found in the  annexedcollection  of Home Office  circulars.   QUESTIONS 4  and 5. What central reserve  ofPohce  Force is therefor  use in  emergencies  inA^arious  parts of the country  ?   What arrangements are there between  countiesfor mutual  assistance ?   ANSWERS 4 and  5. There is no central forcespecially7 established as a reserve, but the  differentforces are  accustomed to  aid  each other  in einer-gencies.    Most  of  the  Pohce  authorities havestanding agreements for this purpose with neigh -bouring authorities  (see circulars on pages 15 and72 annexed volumef), and the Metropolitan Policeare sometimes  able  to  send a  detachment  ofconstables  to any7  place  Avhere additional policemay7 be urgently7 required.   The circulars  on pages60-69 shoAv the practice adA7ocated byT the HomeOffice in regard to  any7 serious ciAil commotion.   QUESTION 6. What special organisation is thereof detectiA-e forces  (a) central, (b) local ?   ANSWER 6. Each  police  authority- organizesits OAATI force separately7, and there is no central detective sy7stem. except that (i.) the finger printsof convicted prisoners are  kept at the Habitual Criminals   Begistry7,  NeAv  Scotland  Yard, andreference is made thereto  by7 the local forces forthe purpose of identification ;  and (ii.) an arrange-ment exists for making the detective staff of the Metropolitan Police  available in  other  districts Avhen their services are desired by7 the local police. See circulars on pages 40 and 70.1   QUESTION 7. May we have a feAv general figures as to the  cost of local police  forces together with police rates and exchequer grants ?   ANSWER, 7. Table  II.  in the Appendix to the enclosed report of H.M. Inspector of Constabulary for 1914 giA-es the cost of the Police and the amount   *Under the  County and Borough Police Act, 1856,  the inspection of the  County and  Borough Police Forces is carried out  by two Inspectors of Constabulary,  for  the Northern and  Southern districts respectively, who report to the Home Office annually.   tThese circulars give model  forms of agreement, with arrangements for  pay, compensation, jurisdiction, etc.    The former circular urges that  in the case of all crimes committed  in trains  Metropolitan detectives  should be called for.   The  latter urges promptitude  in any request for assistance  and the careful preservation of all clues.
of the  Exchequer  Contribution^    While thepresent system can fairly be said to work smoothlyand  harmoniously, it  has long been felt at theHome Office that more efficienc)&apos; in police adminis-tration could be secured by such a revision of thearrangements  for  the Exchequer  Contributiontowards the cost of the Police as would allow  ofthe Central Control being exercisedmore effectively.The proposals made for this purpose were acceptedby the Treasury Committee on Local Taxation  in1914, and will be found on pages 41-43 of theirreport.  Legislation woidd, hoAvever,  be necessaryfor carrying them into effect.  Lastly, it ma,v be mentioned that the need  of  *The total cost of Police Forces in England and Walesin 1913-14,  as given in this table, was   7,327,001,  ofwhich  2,469,874 was met by Exchequer  Contributions, 4,220,847 mainly  from local rates, and the balance  ofJ363G.280 from miscellaneous sources.  Table III. gives the&quot;Net&apos;Cost&quot; of Police in England and Wales as  5,611,272.This  figure  excludes  sums received for services of addi-tional constables, payments for rent, rates, taxes, purchaseof buildings,  etc., and any deficiency of the Police PensionFund.co-ordination between the different Pohce Forcesin  England has  become specially apparent inregard to  (i.) the enforcement of the  Defence ofthe  Realm Regulations  and orders made  underthem, and  (ii.) in the difficult position that hasbeen created by  war conditions with respect tothe varying scales of pay adopted by  the severalpohce forces and  the allowances paid from  PohceFunds.   There appears to be a widespread opinionamong Chief  Officers  of  Police that they shouldhave more guidance  from  the  Home  Office inregard at all events to questions  of the first men-tioned class, and it is also thought that the corn-petition  between  different  forces  in   regard topaj&apos; might be restricted by means of instructionsfrom the  Home  Office.    At  the present  timeconferences  between  the County  and  Boroughpolice forces are being arranged with the help ofthe Home Office, and though the difficulties in theway  of  any  complete  co-ordination  under  theexisting la\v are very great, it is hoped that someprogress  towards  it may be effected through theagency  of  these  voluntary  and informal  con-ferences.
APPENDIX  XVI.REPORT  OF THE  HOUSING  COMMITTEE.                 (I.C. No.  33).  (Adopted by Convention on 5th April, 1918.)             Scope.of the. Inquiry.  1. The terms of reference to your Committeeare:       &quot; To   consider,  with  reference  to  the    Prime  Minister&apos;s letter,  under  what con-    ditions Government assistance can best be    given to Housing in urban areas in Ireland.&quot;  The relevant passage in the Prime Minister &apos;sletter is in -the following terms :-      &quot; The  Government  have  also had sub-    mitted to  them  by  the Labour  representa-    tives in the Convention the need of provision    for dealing with the urgent questions of hous-    ing in  Ireland, and on receiving recommen-    dations from the Convention on  the subject    they would be prepared to consider the  in-    clusion  in the scheme of  settlement of a    substantial provision for  immediately deal-    ing with this vital problem.&quot;  In considering how  we could best discharge theduty entrusted to us by the Convention, we havebeen  compelled to have regard in the first placeto the necessity of completing our labours veryrapidly, in  order that the  general  report  of theConvention might not be  unduly delayed.   Inthese circumstances we have  felt it  to be quiteimpossible  to undertake the  detailed  local en-quiries which wTould be necessary to enable us toframe an accurate estimate of the  extent  of theneed  to be met, and to submit considered pro-posals for dealing with it in the varying circum-stances  of different localities.  We consider, how-ever,  that it  is possible for us to fulfil  the mainobjects  for  which  w7e wrere  appointed withoutundertaking an enquiry of  an elaborate nature.The shortage of houses in urban areas notorious.  2. The need for additional housing accommoda-tion for the working classes in urban areas in Ire-land is a matter of common notoriety.   In hisletter of February 25th, the Prime. Minister refersto it  as an &quot;urgent question,&quot; and  recognisesthe necessity of &quot; immediately dealing wdth thisvital problem.&quot;  We feel that in these  circum-stances it is unnecessary for us to argue whetheror not the need exists.  Its existence is admittedon all hands, and it remains for us to attempt arough estimate of its extent.       Extent of the shortage in Dublin.  3. In the case of Dublin, official figures are avail-able.    The Departmental Committee appointedto enquire  into the housing conditions in Dublinreported, in February,  1914,  that  14,000  newhouses or dwellings were required as a minimum.This was in addition to the necessity for remodel-ling existing  tenement  houses,  so  as  to providesuitable accommodation for 13,000 families.  TheChief Secretary has been good enough to allow usto see a special report on Dublin prepared by Mr.P. C. Cowan,  Chief Engineering Inspector to theLocal Government Board. The Report is a con-fidential document, but we feel at liberty to makeuse of the statistics and findings of fact  which itcontains.  Mr. Cowan states that since the dateof the Report of the Departmental  Committee1,956 tenement  houses,  in which 3,989 familieswere living, have been closeddry the Corporation,under its statutory powers.  In the same periodthe Corporation  have erected three hundred andtwenty-seven  houses, and a  very much smallernumber has been erected  by other agencies.  Mr.Cowan,  therefore, comes to the conclusion that if14,000 new houses were required  in  Dublin  in1914, at  least 16,500 are  required at the presenttime.  We are of  opinion that this figure may be ac-cepted as a fair  estimate which  errs, if at all,  onthe side of understatement.    Extent  of the shortage in urban areas.  4. The Departmental Committee of 1914, whileconfining their  detailed enquiries to Dublin,  ex-pressed the  following opinion  with regard to  therest of the country.  &quot; We are satisfied that  theproblems  surrounding  the housing  question  inDublin present themselves in much the same wayin. most of the towns in Ireland, and we feel thatlittle  advantage would be  gained  by  analysingthem  over again in detail.&quot; We believe that  theCommittee were right in holding that  a scarcityof wrorking class houses  exists in  practically alltowns in Ireland, though the  causes to which itmust  be  attributed  are   different  in  differentplaces.  The case of Dublin,  with  its large tene-ment  houses badly adapted for the purpose whichthey have been made to serve and generally7 in abad state&apos; of repair,  is perhaps, to  some extent,peculiar.  But in other towns other causes have
brought about a scarcity of suitable accommoda-tion&quot; which, if not so acute as it is known to be inDublin, is  sufficiently  serious to call for irnme-diate and energetic action.  In certain areas thedifficulty has arisen from an increase in popula-tion owing  to industrial developments, unaccom-panied by  an increase in building construction.Everywhere,  the  difficulty   or  impossibility  ofcarrying  out housing schemes on a paying basishas prevented  the construction  of new  houseskeeping pace with the deterioration of older ones.We have been  anxious, however, not to use theascertained figures for  Dublin as  an index bywhich the need of the rest of the country can bemeasured, as such a course might lay us open tothe charge  of exaggerating the difficulties of theposition.                               &apos; &apos;       Figures for. the county boroughs.  5 From the best information that we have beenable to obtain,  after consultation  with the muni-cipal authorities,  we estimate the existing short-age of  working class dwellings in the remainingcounty boroughs as follows :       Belfast  .     ....   -   ...     7,500      Cork ...      ...       ...     1,250      Londonderry  ...       ...     1;000      Limerick&apos;     ...       ...     2,000      Waterford     ...       ...      700  This gives us a total deficiency for the  CountyBoroughs of 28,950. Estimate of the shortage in other urban areas.  0. The population of the County  Boroughs  isabout 875,000, and the total number of new housesrequired  in  the  County  Boroughs works  out atone  new  house  to thirty  of  the  population.In  the  ninety urban  districts and  twenty-ninemunicipal towns  in Ireland  the  population  isabout 014,250, and if we apply to this populationthe figure just arrived at for the County Boroughs,namely,  that one new house  is required  forevery thirty  of  the   population,  we  come  tothe conclusion that in these one hundred  andnineteen  towns   the   total  number  of  newhouses required  amounts to 20,475.   We  feelsatisfied that this  figure does not err on the sideof exaggeration.   The  conditions in  some of thesmaller towns are  exceedingly bad, and  there areplaces which do not come within the term &apos;&apos; urbanareas,&quot; in the strictly legal sense, where the needis  very  great and pressing.   Amongst  such wemay  mention Kildare, Tralee,  and Mullingar.Adding the  figures thus ascertained  to  the totalfor  the County Boroughs,  we get a grand totalof 49,425-say, 50,000.  We have,  however,  thought it well  to checkthis figure by another method of calculation.  Inthe Census of 1911, the total number of &quot; thirdand fourth  class houses &quot; is given  as  247,025The town population may  be taken  at  one-thirdof the total  population of the country, and if weassume that these houses are equally distributed,according to population, between town and coun-try we arrive  at a figure of about 85,000  as  thenumber of houses requiring in 1911 to be replacedby new buildings  in the towns.   In the sevenyears which have  elapsed since the  Census wastaken, the need has probably grown greater ratherthan less.  Taking a mean of the results of the two methodsof calculation adopted, we are of opinion that itwill  be  reasonable  to  estimate  the  numberof new working-class houses urgently required inurban  areas  in  Ireland  at  67,500.    It   isimportant, however,  that  an  early opportunityshould be taken of arriving  at a more accurateestimate by means of a detailed enquiry.                Estimate of cost.  7.  Under existing conditions, the average cost ofworking-class dwellings, including the purchase ofland, the development of sites  and the actualcost  of construction, cannot be put at much lessthan four hundred pounds.   We thus arrive at anestimate of   27,000,000 as the total amount ofcapital  expenditure required to deal  with  thehousing problem in urban areas in Ireland.   Degree of Government assistance required.  8. We proceed to consider what degree of finan-cial assistance from  the  central government willbe necessary to enable tins need to be met.   In thisenquiry we  have had the advantage of  reading areport submitted to  the  Ministry  of Beconstruc-tion by a special panel of  the Reconstruction Com-mittee on Housing after  the War in England andW7ales.  W7e do not propose to refer to the recom-mendations in this report, as it has been communi-cated to us  confidentially, but we may say thatthe report clearly establishes the fact that theconstruction of  working-class  houses  on  aneconomic basis has become practically impossiblewithout  Government assistance,  and that  sincethe war construction has  so nearly come to astandstill that the deficiency, which was  alreadyconsiderable in 1914, is increasing at a rapid rate. Degree of assistance proposed in England and                    Wales.  9.  The English Local Government Board haveissued a circular indicating the terms on  whichthe  Government  is  prepared  to give financialassistance to local authorities in connection withthe undertaking of housing schemes. This circularcontemplates the provision by the Government ofa percentage of the loan charges in connectionwith such schemes sufficient to relieve the localauthority  of  seventy-five per cent,  of the esti-mated annual deficit.  More liberal assistance required in Ireland.  10. We feel it necessary to say at once that theterms proposed would be  altogether&apos; inadequateto meet the circumstances of Ireland. We under-stand that in Great Britain the problem of housingin urban areas has been very largely accentuatedby causes due to the war.  There have been verylarge movements of population to localities wherethere  has been a  great  growth  of industrialactivity, and the normal provision of working-class houses has ceased for  the  past three and ahalf years. The increase in the rate of interest, inwages and  in  the cost of all kinds  of  buildingmaterials has resulted in raising the cost of con-struction by probably not less than sixty pe&quot;&apos;&quot;
The proposals of the English Local GovernmentBoard are, therefore, presumably, designed  tomeet a situation which  has been due to specialcauses arising out of the war, and are based uponthe assumption that, but for those causes, it wouldhave been possible for local authorities to supplythe amount of working  class accommodation re-quired.  No such assumption can be justified inthe case of Ireland, where already before the war,it was clear that the problem had reached dimen-sions altogether bevond the resources of the localauthorities.   As the provision of the houses re-quired  was not found  possible,  to  a sufficientextent, on the basis of pre-war cost, there mustbe a subsidy  sufficient to bring  the  cost to thelocal authority well  below the pre-war cost, if aserious  attempt is to be made to deal with theproblem.   Degree of assistance proposed for Ireland.  11. We.are disposed to consider that the degreeof Government assistance necessary will be notless than fifty per cent, of the total capital cost,during the years  immediately following the war.As the cost of building may be expected to decline,though not to reach the pre-war level, in subse-quent  years,  the  amount of assistance from theGovernment could also probably be reduced.   Itis, however,  essential  that it  should be  suffi-ciently large to enable working-class houses to beerected without throwing  any but a small chargeon local rates.  If this condition is  not satisfied,we fear that the needs of the situation are neverlikely  to be  met.  In this  connection we maypoint out that Parliament has already made com-paratively   liberal   provision   for   providinglabourers&apos;  cottages  in. rural  areas in Ireland.Under the Labourers Acts, money could  be bor-rowed for the provision of such cottages at a rateof three  and a quarter per cent., which  coveredboth  interest  and  sinking fund charges,  for  aperiod of sixty-eight and a half years, and of thischarge thirty-six  per cent, is paid  out of fundsprovided by the  Government.    The working  ofthe Acts has given general satisfaction, and, theneeds of the urban population being now certainlymore pressing, there is ample justification for ex-tending to them a more generous degree of assist-ance  than that which has been granted  to therural  population!   The  general   conclusion  atwhich we  have  arrived is that the number  ofhouses to be  erected in urban  areas&apos; so  soon  ascircumstances  admit of the work being carriedout  may  be  put at  67,500; that  the  total costwill  be &quot;approximately  27,000,000; and that  itwill  be necessary for fifty per cent, of the loancharges to be borne by the Central  Government.      Assistance in respect of past  loans.  12. We are further of opinion that  a measure ofassistance, winch need not be  so large as fiftyper cent., should be given to local authorities inrespect of loans  already incurred for  housing pur-poses.  We are.impelled to make this recommen-dation in view of the  heavy burden which suchloans have thrown ,upon the local rates, and  he-cause  we. consider that local authorities whichhave made a serious effort to cope with the prob-lem  in  the  past would otherwise  be  unfairlypenalised, in comparison with those which havedeferred  action until Government assistance wasforthcoming.  In  this connection we would  re-commend  an  extension  of  the  principles em-bodied in the &quot; Clancy Act &quot;of 1908.   Underthat Act the income of the Housing Fund is dis-tributed  among  local authorities in proportion tothe charges in respect of loans raised by themunder the Act for  housing purposes.  We recom-mend that  equal  assistance should be given inrespect of loans  incurred for similar purposes  be-fore  the  passing of  the  Act of 1908.   To affordsubstantial relief, the income of the Fund will re-quire to be substantially increased.  We  further  recommend  that   the  working-classes  in  urban  areas should be afforded  in-creased facilities for acquiring on easy terms asregards security  and payment of instalments, theownership of the houses in winch they live, whensuch houses are provided under the scheme whichwe contemplate.          General principles of policy.  15. The time at our disposal has rendered it im-possible for us to frame a general policy for regu-lating the provision of urban housing.  We  are,moreover, of opinion that it is for the  Govern-ment to frame and for Parliament to approve anysuch policy.  We think,  however, that it  is rightthat we  should indicate  certain  general  prin-ciples which ought, in our opinion, to be followed.  We recognise that it would  be impossible,  or,at any rate; undesirable, to apply a uniform  sys-tem and  entrust the provision of urban housingaccommodation to any particular agency through-out the whole of Ireland.  In some cases the workcan best be undertaken by the local authority, inothers  by Public  Utility  Societies,  or  privateenterprise;  and  the  special  circumstances  ofDublin may even necessitate  setting up  a newauthority which would be  able to  extend  itsoperations over a larger area than that  of theexisting  municipality.   But we  think that it ispossible  to leave room for the application of allthese systems,  while  observing certain  generalprinciples.  We are of opinion that, whatever bethe actual agency  undertaking the task  of con-straction, general control should, as  a rule, restwith the local authority, and that the financialassistance from the Government  which we haverecommended  should be given to such  author!-ties, or  to private  owners  or agencies,  subjectto  the approval  of. the local authorities as torents  and  other  conditions.  In  every  case,therefore, the local  authority will be responsiblefor the general policy adopted, and  the  mannerin which it is carried out. - In the event, however,of  a local authority neglecting  to discharge itsobligations in  the matter, there should be power,on the analogy of the provisions  contained in theLabourers Acts, for the Government to interveneand provide the  additional accommodation  re-quired.  We  do not  think  that it  should benecessary to set up a new department of Govern-ment to deal with Housing, though,  no doubt,  ageneral increase in activity in this direction wouldinvolve increasing the staff of  the Local Govern-ment Board.   We are of  opinion that it shouldbe a condition of Government assistance that thesite and arrangement of the houses, the accommo-dation to be provided, and the rents to be  chargedto  the occupiers should receive the  approval ofthe Local Government Board.   We think that inall these matters there  should be as much elas-ticity as possible, and  that scope should be givenfor experiments in methods of construction,  de-
30sign of houses, etc., but it is of the greatest im-portance that  a reasonably high standard shouldbe insisted upon, both with regard to the numberof houses to be built on any given area,  and theamount  of  accommodation  provided, an eachdwelling.  We note  that the English LocalGovernment Board have laid it down as a condi-tion of Government assistance that not more thantwelve houses  shall be built on one acre of land;and there is a  consensus of opinion that the mostsuitable type of house is a self-contained dwellingwith two or three bedrooms, a kitchen,  -a  sculleryand a bath.  A certain proportion of houses witha parlour, or  a  fourth bedroom should  be pro-vided.      Reduction of cost of acquiring land. . 14.  Under the existing law,  the legal expensesand delays connected with the  acquisition of landfor housing purposes constitute a serious obstacleto the carrying out of schemes.  W7e do not desireto overburden this report  with a,. technical dis-cussion and we  are therefore  content to recordour opinion that these expenses and delays can beand ought to be reduced, and that the machineryof  the &quot;vesting order&quot;  adopted in  the. LandPurchase Acts would seem to be applicable to theacquisition of land for  housing  purposes, andwould  be  attended by the advantage of ensuringprompt possession and security of title at a lowcost.   The distribution of compensation amonginterested parties, as well as the ascertainment ofthe amount due, should be entrusted to a LocalGovernment Board arbitrator.                  Conclusion.  15. In the Prime Minister&apos;s letter, which wequoted at the beginning of this Report, he statedthat the Government would be prepared to con-sider the inclusion in any scheme of settlement of asubstantial provision for dealing with this problem.In the event of an Irish Parliament and Govern-ment being established,  we  are,  therefore, ofopinion  that that Parliament should have placedat its disposal  an annual sum of money sufficientto meet fifty per cent, of  the loan charges whichwill  be  incurred,  if the recommendations in  thisBeport  are accepted.L. 0*NEILL,R.

(Sec p.,  supra).CONSIDERATION  OF   REPORT.Paragraph 32.Amendment proposed (MR. W. M. MURPHY):  Insert at end of Prime Minister&apos;s letter dated 25th February:      &quot; The Prime Minister&apos;s letter created a wholly new situation, for whereas in his letter to Mr.Redmond of the IGth May he invited the Convention to frame  a Constitution for Ireland within theEmpire,  in the foregoing letter he practically defined the only Constitution which  he would adopt.The letter had the further effect that Lord Midleton, who was willing to give Police and every fiscalpower except Customs  to the Irish  Parliament on its  creation, withdrew  from that position andsupported Lord MacDonnelTs Motion to withhold  Police and Post Office during the War, and bothCustoms and Excise for an indefinite period.    &quot; Again the  Committee on  Defence had reported with one dissentient on the 26th Februarythat the  control of the Irish Police should be entrusted to the  Irish  Government,  but in a supple-mentary  Report,  dated March 5th,  they referred  to the Prime Minister&apos;s  letter and came  to theconclusion &apos; that it may, perhaps,  be  essential that during the  War Imperial Control of Policeshould, for Administrative purposes,  be retained.&apos; &quot;Amendment  rejected by 41 votes to 16.FOB (16).AGAINST (41).J.

MEMORANDUM  BY  LORD  MACDONNELL   IN  CONNECTION WITH  SECTION V.  OF    THE  RESOLUTION  STANDING  IN  HIS   NAME  ON  THE  AGENDA  PAPER.*N.B. The Resolution referred to was as follows :   That  the Convention,  having considered theletter of the  Prime  Minister to the  Chairman,resolves to  adopt the  following provisions andprocedure :     I. The matters specified as unfitted for ini-        mediate  legislation, namely,  control  of        customs  and excise by an  Irish Parlia-        ment, be  postponed  for   further con-        sideration until after the war, provided        that the  question of such control shall be        considered and decided by the Parliament        of  the United Kingdom  within   seven        years after the conclusion of peace.  For        the purpose of deciding in the Parliament        of the United  Kingdom the question  of        the future control  of Irish  customs and        excise, a number of Lish representatives        proportioned to the population of Ireland        shall be  called to the  Parliament  of the        United Kingdom.   II. That the administration of the Irish police        and Irish postal service shall be reserved        during the war to  the Imperial Govern-        ment, provided that as soon  as possible        after  the   cessation of  hostilities the        administration of these two services shall        become  automatically  subject  to the        Irish  Parliament.   III. That on the creation of an Irish Parliament         the administration  of the  Customs and         Excise services shall be entrusted to  a         Customs Board composed half of persons         nominated by the Imperial Treasury and         half  of  persons nominated by the Irish         Treasury, with a Chairman appointed by         the  King.    Among the  duties  of  the         Board shall fall the ascertainment of the         true Irish Customs and Excise Revenue.   IV. That, as soon as ma,y be, a Royal Commis-         sion shall be appointed to determine the         amount of  contribution which  Ireland         should pay to the expenses of the Empire,         and  the practicability of  establishing a         Free Trade agreement between the two         countries,  should  the Imperial  Parlia-         ment transfer to Ireland  the control of         its Customs and Excise.   V. The embodiment in resolutions of the agree-        ments already reached on the Report of        the  Grand Committee, and the  con-        tinuance of the discussions on the heads        on  which  the Convention  has  not  yet        pronounced its opinion.  VI. The framing of a Joint Report on  subjects        on which a general agreement  has been        reached, and  the framing of joint  or        individual  memoranda  on  subjects  on        which general  agreements have not been        reached.  If and when the approval of the  Convention isobtained for  the first  four sections of my Reso-lution on the Agenda Paper the  materials will befor the most part available for drafting the reportof the Convention so far as Finance. Police, andthe Postal services are  concerned.    The  Conven-tion.  however,  was assembled  for  the  purposeas stated  by the Prime Minister in his letter of16th May. 1917. &quot;of producing a scheme of Irishself-government.&quot; and  until this  is done the Con-vention will  not  have discharged  the  task itundertook.  I, like everyone else, recognise the necessity  forexpedition.    Fortunately, the materials for  theexpeditious conclusion  of  the greater part of ourlabours are at hand in  the Report which has beenissued (I.C. No. 20) of the  contusions reachedby the Grand Committee, and  of  the questionsremaining for decision.   It is true that this reportdoes not bind the Grand Committee, still less theConvention, even on the points  on  which no  dif-ference of opinion is recorded, because all the pro-visional  understandings  which  were arrived  atwere contingent on a full agreement  on the generalscheme being  reached :   and  it cannot  be saidthis agreement has been reached.   This factrenders it the more necessary for the Convention.to record its acceptance or rejection of the GrandCommittee&quot;s report.   It does not seem to me that this need be a lengthyprocess in  respect of the  21  heads of the GrandCommittee&quot;s report.    The Grand Committee wereunanimous  in  their  provisional  agreement  ontwelve  heads (viz.. 1.  2, 4, 5, 6. 7, S. 9. 12,  14-18.  and  19).   In  view  of  the  representativenature  of the Grand Committee,  the  careful    * This Memorandum is reprinted as it is referred to in the Report of the Ulster  Unionists (seep.    ).
discussion that was  given  to  these matters, andthe provisional unanimity on them, I submit thatthe Convention  might  well  come  to a decisionupon  them without  much  discussion.  As regards the other nine heads (viz., 3,  10, 11,13, 15,  16,  17,  20,  21) on which a provisionalagreement was not arrived at, it should be notedthat in some  cases the lack of unanimity was con-fined to one or two sub-heads, that in other casesthe matters in dispute are not  very important,and that there are only two  or three matters onAvhich serious discussion may be necessary.  The points raised in  these ten heads are as fol-lows : Head  3.  Sub-Head (3).   The  Army and Navy.      The  differences  of opinion in the  Grand    Committee were limited  to  two questions : -    (a) Whether  the assent  of  the  Irish  Parlia-    ment should  be required  for Conscription,    and (b) Whether the Irish Government should    be authorised after 5 years to raise a Terri-    torial Force under certain conditions.  There    need be no delay on these points if the  Con-    vention adopt (as  I venture respectfully to    advise them to adopt) the Report of the  Sub-    Committee on Defence.  Sub-Head  (4). The   question  of  Commercial      Treaties will  not arise if Customs  be re-      served.  Sub-Heads (7)  and (8). The experience  of the      Grand Committee seems to suggest the  diffi-      eulty of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion      on these somewhat technical and involved      matters by discussion  in full  Convention.      The Convention  might be content to record      the fact that there Avas a difference of      opinion on these points, without making a      recommendation.   But if  I may  express      my oAvn opinion I would recommend a      compromise on the basis of reserving to the      Imperial Parliament Coinage, Legal tender,      Designs for Stamps and Standard of Aveights      and  measures, and  by declaring  that, as      regards Patents and   Copyright,  Ireland      shoidd  stand  in  the position of a Colony      Avhich  had  adopted the provisions  of the      Imperial Acts of 1907 and 1911.  N.B.- -Head 9.  The term  of the Senate:s life      is  not  stated by the  Grand  Committee,      but as the  Electoral Sub-Committee  have      recommended  ten years I think the  Con-      vention might agree.  Head  10.   The Grand  Committee have not      come  to  a decision on  the  question of      Proportional Representation Avhere  a  con-      stituency   returns  3  or  more  members.      HaA-ing regard to the  great preponderance      of affirmative reasoned argument on this      point in the recent debates in both Houses      of  Parliament,   and  to   the  advantages      which  must necessarily  accrue to minorities      in Ireland from the adoption of the system, I      beg  to recommend  that the  question be      decided in  the affirmatiA7e.         The Franchise Avill naturally- be the new-      Franchise under the Representation of the      People Act.         The effect of the findings of the Electoral      Systems Sub-Committee is to enlarge urban       representation and reduce to some extent       the rural representation.   The outcome is       that  there  should be  about 54 urban       members and about  99  rural  members,       making vvith 4 University representatives a       total of 157 elected members, Avhich with the       40 nominated Unionist members  will give       a  House of  Commons  of 197  members.       The  delimitation  of  the  constituencies       would naturally be the work of an expert       commission to begin AArork AA-hen the BiU is       introduced into the Imperial Parliament.  Head 11.   The point not decided by the Grand       Committee under this head is  AA-hether the       Senate  should  be  gi\7en  the power  of       suggesting  amendments  to  money bills.       Some time ago a paper explaining the law on       this point in the Australian Parliament was       circulated to  the Grand Committee, and I       think if that paper Avere circulated to  the       ConA7ention a decision could  be  speedily       arriAred at.  Head 13.   The question of Irish representation       in the Imperial Parliament is important.         (a) hi the first place the number of Irish       representatiAres has to be determined.  The       alternatiAres are the adoption of the numbers       stated in the Act of 1914, \iz., 42, or the       number indicated by population, auz., 65.         (6) In the second place it must  be deter-       mined  A\diether the  Irish  representatiATes       at  Westminster  should  be a delegation       apjaointed by the Irish House af Commons       or Avhether they should be elected by the       A-oters.   In the former  case  there is  the       further  question   Avhether  the   election       should  be on  the  system of Proportional       Representation.  In reference to the House of Lords I respectfullysuggest  that   the  Irish  representation in   theHouse of Lords should  continue as  at  present,unless and until that Chamber be remodelled, andthat in such a  contingency  the  matter  of Irishrepresentation in the House of Lords should bereconsidered.  Head 15.  This question will haA-e already- been       settled, if Section I.  of my Resolution be       adopted.  Head 16.  The question of  the  Imperial contri-       bution to  be paid, pending  the report of       the Royal Commission mentioned in Section       IV. of my Resolution, must be considered.       Obviously7 the Convention cannot  under-       take  an  inquiry  into  Ireland&apos;s  relatiA7e       capacity for making a  contribution or do       more than indicate  a rough  and ready       method of indicating the contribution such       as my  suggestion of  1 per  head of  the       population,  or Lord Midleton&apos;s suggestion       of 19th  December,  1917,  that it should       be  the  proceeds of  Customs  and  excess       profits tax, subject to a  transfer to  the       Irish  Exchequer out of these proceeds of       any  sum  by  AAdiich the  Irish  ReA7enue,       at present rates, falls short  of the estimated       expenditure of 1917-18 (Avith, I Avould add,       a suitable sum, say  200,000, for the cost       of the Irish Parliament, Ministers,  and neAv       departments  such  as the Irish Treasury),       and to a  further transfer of any increased       expenditure attributable to Land Purchase       (and presumably Housing) under  the pro-       posals adopted by7 the Convention.
  Head 17.  The Report on Land Purchase  had      already been discussed and is now down      on the Agenda Paper for final orders.  Head 20.  Probably a general statement as to      arrangements  for the  Civil Sendee some-      what  on the  lines  indicated  would be      accepted by the Convention, without much      discussion.  Head 21.  Of the services mentioned Land  Pur-      chase and the Postal Services have   been      dealt  with above.   The other services  pre-      sent no difficulty as the proposal is only a      provision to enable the Irish Government to      defer  for purposes  of  administrative con      venience taking over certain  services and      does  not seem controversial.  If the Report of the Grand Committee be dealtwith in the  way indicated the Convention will bein an advantageous position to review the wholesituation ;  and to afford to the  Ulster delegatesa further opportunity of suggesting additions to,or modifications in, the scheme which the interestsof Ulster may seem to  them  to call for.  If anyadditions are deemed desirable,  it  seems to methey  might  advantageously  follow the line in-dicated in my proposals for  a Provincial GrandCommittee.  I would add that  such a  GrandCommittee ought not at the outset to be createdon the basis of  a permanent arrangement, butas  an arrangement  to be called into operationad hoc.  My expectation is that it  will rarely ornever be needed.  My hope  is  that  Ulster willfind in a United  Parliament  for  Ireland a bodyscrupulously ready to respond to every reasonabledemand of Ulster.
