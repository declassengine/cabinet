Russia/001.THE BOLSHEVIKS.BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.     Organised Socialism in Russia is of comparatively recentgrowth;  it has nevertheless &quot;been the first to seize power andto attempt to govern a European country on the most extremeSocialist principles.  In 1893 small Socialist circles, knownas Soyuzy borbi (fighting unions), began to form themselvesin the chief Russian cities.  They were composed almost whollyof students and intellectuals, the working classes at thattime having no knowledge or understanding of Socialism.  Theirfirst task therefore was to instruct the workmen, and attractthem by championing them in those conflicts which interestedthem most closely., such as in the struggle for higher wages.Thus the early activities of the Soyuzy were mainly economic,though the leaders kept their ultimate political goal clearlyIn view.     It was not until 1900 that the first fighting Socialistorganisation was formed.  In that year Lenin and flartov foundedtheir paper Iskra  (Spark) in Switzerland with the object ofteaching the Russian proletariat that their main object must beto seize the reins of Government,   Round the Iskra weregrouped a number of daring revolutionaries who made it theirbusiness to smuggle the paper into Russia and  build up (?fighting organisation there with definite political ends.From its earliest  days the new organisation abandoned allpretence at democracy in the popular sense.  All power wasconcentrated:in the hands of the leaders of the local Committeesin different parts of Russia, the motto being not the democraticcontrol of the Committees by the majority of the workmen thathad joined the party, but the dictatorship of the secret
CoDmittees over the masses.   The same character of governmentis &quot;being maintained by the Bolsheviks at the present timewith their open repudiation of the Constituent Assembly  andtheir assertion of the dictatorship of the proletariat overother classes.     The autocratic character of the early secret organisationwas not maintained without a struggle/ which in 1903 at theParty Conference in London led to a split.  The Bolsheviks,who were in a majority, stood for the dictatorship of theparty organisation;  the Mensheviks for a more democraticorganisation that would admit the workmen to an equality withthe intellectual leaders in the party.  The Bolsheviks wereopposed to such reforms, preferring to sacrifice democracyfor the sake of preserving the extreme revolutionary characterof the party.     During the Revolution of 1905 the tactics of both partiesbecame apparent.  The Mensheviks sought to support and strengthenthe liberal&apos; bourgeoisie, while the Bolsheviks, who reliedentirely upon exciting the revolutionary instincts of the pro-letariat, opposed all co-operation with the moderates.   TheMensheviks in 1905 held the same views as they set forth againin 1917 that Russia, being a backward country, cannot advanceat one bound from a feudal autocracy to a Socialist Republic,but must pass through the intermediate stage of a bourgeoisrevolution.   By. their support of the bourgeoisie they hopedto strengthen the liberal elements in it, and complainedbitterly of the hostility of the Bolsheviks, who by theiractions had driven the bourgeoisie into the arms of reaction.The Bolsheviks were not content with the idea of putting Russiaon an equality with the rest of Europe by means of a politicalrevolution;  they wished to lead the way to a general socialrevolution throughout Europe.  Thus when the Revolution of 1905
had ended in failure, they, unlike the Mensheviksj refused toengage In the slow  work of constitutional development, butlaid their plans in secret for a. new rising of the proletariat.     The Bolshevik wing of the Social Democratic party, being anillegal organisation, had to carry on its work in Russia insecret, while its leaders wrote  and  organised abroad.   The -leading spirit was Lenin.  It was he who had founded theparty, and his word was law.  From the beginning he has stoodout head and shoulders above any other members of his party,and in the long run his opinion  always prevails.     The outbreak of the war In  1914 witnessed the immediatecollapse of the International upon which such high hopes hadbeen placed.   At the International Conferences at Stuttgartin 1907 and at Basle in 1912 a general plan of action had beenagreed upon in case of a European war, but the details had notbeen elaborated.  The Conference that was to have met inVienna in 1914 might have witnessed further progress, but it isdoubtful whether for some years  to come a common programme ofcampaign, that would have commanded universal observance,could have been elaborated.  The Bolsheviks maintain that theprevious Conferences had outlined a sufficiently clear policyfor the various Socialist parties to have followed at the out-break of the war, and bitterly attack the treachery of theircomrades in England, France, Germany and Russia, but in othercountries the issues in this war did not present themselves inso cut-and-dried a form as they  did to the Bolsheviks.     The Bolshevik theories as to the origin of the war are tooclear cut to be convinving.  Out of the infinitely complexsituation which led up to the war they see certain concrete factsand beyond these facts they refuse to go.  To them the period ofnational wars is a thing of the past;  at present we are living in
vC -    an  age  of  imperialism and this war is nothing else  hut a    struggle betv/een two rapacious imperialisms.   Lenin refuses  to    compare the  present war with the earlier wars of the 19th    century.    &quot;Those former wars&quot;, he writes,  &quot;were a  continuation    of  the  policy  of long national movements of the  bourgeoisie,    movements  against a foreign yoke and against absolutism.    There was  no other question at that time save whether ycu    preferred  the  success of one bourgeoisie or the  other.  One    cannot  be  a  Marxist without admiring the great bourgeois    revolutionaries who had a historic right to speak in the  name    of  bourgeois fatherlands, and who raised new nations to a    civilised  life in the struggle with feudalism.  At  the same    time one  oannot be a Marxist without despising those Socialists    who speak  of the defence of their countries in connection with    the stifling of Belgium by German Imperialists and  the    plundering of  Austria and Turkey by the Imperialists of England,    Franee, Russia and Italy&quot;.        The Bolsheviks can admit none but sordid motives to  any    bourgeois  Government in an age of imperialism.   Believing as    they do In hard and fast historical laws based entirely on    material considerations, they refuse to believe  in  any pro-    fessions of  sincerity or any disinterested  motives  on the    part of British statesmen.        This  division into national and imperialist wars raises    the question of the defence of onefs country. Zinoviev,  one of    Lenin1s closest associates, has stated the  views of his party    very clearly on this question.  &quot;We do not  reject&quot;.,  he says,    &quot;the defence of our country in general,   We reject  the defence    of  our  country in imperialist, i.e. in reactionary,  capitalist    wars.   But  we do not confine ourselves to  pointing out the    indisputable fact that the present war is an imperialist,  one;
Ill                                5.    we  also maintain  that  in  the  present  imperialist  epoch wars    between great  powers cannot be  anything else.   This  does not    mean  that  in any  circumstances  we  reject the defence of one&apos;s    country in an  Imperialist epoch..  Could there  be  just wars  in  an    epoch of national wars?   Yes,  there could be.   The wars of  the    great French Revolution were  for  the  most part just  wars, as    also  were  the  Italian  wars.  But  can  there be  just wars now in an    imperialist epq^c-h?    Yes,  there  can  be;  but  only under two    conditions.  (1)  The war  of a triumphant proletariat in any    country, defending the Socialism  it has conquered- against other    States that defend a capitalist regime.  (2) The  wars of China,    India or other countries, oppressed by imperialism,.in the    cause of their independence against European imperialist    Governments&quot;.          These are &quot;the ideas  which have determined the attitude of    the Bolsheviks towards the  war  since  its outbreak.   Soon after    the war broke  out Lenin founded his paper Social  Demokrat    in  Switzerland, assisted  by 2inoviev*   Meanwhile in Russia the    five  members of the Duma  who  belonged to the Bolshevik wing    of  the Social  Democratic  party were exiled to  Siberia.  They    not only refused  to vote  the  war  credits in 1914  - as also  did    Kerenski  and his  party -  but  they  were unwilling  to  acquiesce    silently in a  war which they  abominated.  Even with  their leaders    in  exile,  either  abroad or  in Siberia, the Bolsheviks made  their    influence  felt at various periods  of  the war.   One  of the most    critical moments  was the  autumn of 1915 after  the great retreat    from  Poland.    It was  the time  of  the formation of the Pro-    gressive Bloc  in  the Duma and the  establishment of the War    Industrial Committees  to  organise  a better output of  munitions.    Even  the moderate Socialists  refused  to join the  Progressive    Bloc  which was mainly  a  Cadet-Octobrist Coalition;   with
regard to the War.Industrial -Committees, presided over byGuchkov, there was a sharp&quot;dispute before Labour representativeswere elected.  The Bolsheviks, as was to be expected, refusedto have anything to do with it, and at the first vote carriedthe day.  The Government, however, was not content with thisdecision, and, after many arrests had been irede, a new votewas taken which decided in favour of sending Labour represent-atives under Gvostfev, a Menshevik and later a member ofKerenskifs Government In  the autumn of 1917.  This incidentis but typical of the uncompromising attitude adopted by theBolsheviks throughout the earlier part of the war.     The Bolsheviks themselves before the Revolution onlyrecognised two main Socialist parties in Russia - the Bolsheviksor Revolutionary Marxists and the Mensheviks, whom theybranded as Opportunists or Liquidators.  They denied theexistence of a Centre as  in Germany on the ground&apos; that inRussia the revolutionary, social and political conditions madeany vague conciliatory line impossible.  At the same time theyadmitted that attempts had been made to form such a Centre,but had never received any real backing.   The Bolsheviks onlyrecognise Revolutionaries and Opportunisms; to them no viamedia is possible;  those who are not for them are againstthem.  Writing in 1915 Zinoviev even scorned Trotskifs attitudeon the ground that he had not thrown himself wLole-heartedlywith the Bolsheviks:  &quot;Trotsklfs political Interest, hispolitical line is summed up in an effort not to allow a com-plete rupture between the Social Chauvinists and Uie OpportunistsIn this respect thd lessons of the war have taught him nothing&quot;.It was not until after his return to Russia in 1917 that Trotskijoined the Bolsheviks.  In 1915 Trotski1s paper Hashe Slovo,which was published in Paris, could write as follows:   &quot;In
Russia there is no bourgeois democracy,, the peasantry cannotplay a revolutionary role,  and the Russian proletariat mustwait until, together with the proletariat of other countries,it can carry out a revolution on an  international scale&quot;.To the Bolshevik such reasoning is mere Opportunism, andOpportunism is half-brother to Chauvinism.  Lenin, in one of hismost uncompromising articles in the  Social gemokrat, lashesthem all as traitors to revolutionary Marxism:-  ;&apos;By SocialChauvinists we mean those who recognise the defense of theircountry in. the present imperialist war. who justify the unionof Socialists with the bourgeoisie and the Governments of theircountries  in this war, who refuse to preach and support therevolutionary activities of the proletariat against their ownbourgeoisie.  It is clear that the fundamental political ideaat the back of Social Chauvinism is  exactly the same as thaton which Opportunism is based.  Opportunism is the sacrificeof the interests of the masses for the sake of the temporaryinterests  of a small minority of the.working men, or rather theunion of part of the working men with the bourgeoisie againstthe mass of the proletariat.   Opportunism came into existenceduring the last few decades owing to peculiarities in thedevelopment of capital, a class of privileged working men beinfemade bourgeois and being cut adrift from the sufferings andrevolutionary temperament of the masses.   The imperialist warIs the direct continuation and completion of this state ofaffairs, for it is a war for the privileges of the great nationsfor the partition of colonies among them and for their supremacyover other nations&quot;.     Given the existence of the war, the main object of theBolsheviks was to work for peace and revolution.   Though ad-mi t ting that the war might hasten social revolution in Europe,
they were not willing to buy revolution at so great a price.In October 1914 Trotski published a pamphlet in Zurich on&quot;The War and the International&quot;, in which he alludes to thepossibility of a revolution in Russia as a result of the war.but adds:  &quot;We., Russian Social Democrats, hold firmly enoughto the international position in order once for all to refuseto purchase the possible liberation of Russia at the price of-the certain destruction of the freedom of France and Belgium,and - what is still more important - the poisoning of theGerman and Austrian proletariat with imperialism&quot;.     The Bolsheviks prayed for the defeat of the Tsar&apos;s Govern^-ment, as they knew that such a  defeat would lead to aRevolution still more violent than that of 1905.  This theymaintained would put them in power and enable them to stop thewa.r by rousing the European proletariat against their Govern-ments.  As early as October 1915 they formulated their plansin case of a Russian Revolution:-  &quot;To the question what theparty of the proletariat would do, if a revolution placed Itin power in the present war, we reply:  &quot;We should offer peaceto all the belligerents on condition that the colonies and alldependent and oppressed peoples were set free.   NeitherGermany, England, nor Prance would accept these conditionsunder their present Governments.  We should, therefore,  have toprepare and conduct a revolutionary war, not only so as  tocarry out our minimum programme, but to cause a rising in allcolonies and dependent countries in Asia, and, above all,  toincite the Socialist proletariat of Europe to Revolution&quot;.     A further analysis of Bolshevik policy since the  Revolutionof 1917 will show how far they have modified their originalposition when brought face to face with the realities  of  the                                         9                                         kwar and of revolution, 2.3,18.           -----------------------
