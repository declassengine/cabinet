it(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI&apos;-; BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3  gOYSMCTgli               WAR  CABINET.&quot;tOMMITTEB TO ENQUIRE X3T0 TUB ORdAHI-tATIQ^-  AND ^M^MlM^S^M^^MI^^^.    (Reference War Cabinet 219, Minute 5.) Iijeaorandum by the Chancellor of the Jbxchequer.      The War Cabinet on the 9th January last approved theappointment of a Treasury Committee under the Chairmanshipof Sir John. Bradbury to consider the question of the staffs ofGovernment Departments recruited since the War with a.view to -^eventing overlapping and effecting economies.  The Committeehas obtained a number of Returns from various Departmentsshowing the actual numbers, organisation, rates of pay andhours of duty of their staffs, and it is olear that theCommittee has before them a task of very large dimensions ifgoo4 results are to be obtained.  In the opinion of theCommittee no useful progress is likely to be made by takingoral evidence and they consider that in order to obtain realknowledge it ia necessary for the Committee to make investigationsin tho Departments themselves.  This is more than the membersof the Committee could themselves undertake and they haveasked me for authority to appoint inspecting officers to goround the Departments and to&quot;report to them from time to time.It ia proposed that there should be two inspeotors for eachDepartment, one with outside business experience and the otherwith a knowledge of Civil Service organisation from within.      Before giving my assent I thought it right to bringthe matter before the War Cabinet in order that the inspectorswhen they are appointed may be able to go into the DepartmentsWith the authority of the Government.  I ask the War Cabinetto approve the Committees proposals                                  (Sgd.) A *BOBAR LAW. April. 3th. 191,8.111 mmigmmm0tmm0mmmmmmmtmm/fm0Km9ttttmtm
