V.14                         ENCLOSURE I.                                       The V/hi3ky Association,                                          68/70, Fenchurch Street,                                              London,  E.C. 3.                                     28th March, 191c?-.My Lord,                RE CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAFFIC)                                  &amp;                  PROPOSED FURTHER DILUTION OF SPIRITS.         It has presumably been brought to your notice by your deputy   * Mr. Roffsy- with whom representatives of this and other Associa-   tions have had frequent consultations recently regarding the terms   of the proposed &quot;TOiieky Prices Order&quot;, that the Licensed Victualler   representatives from Scotland and the North of England testified   very emphatically on these occasions that much of the industrial   dissatisfaction in munition areas in relation to beer and spirits   was due,  in the main,  not so largely to high prices but to the   quality and that the working men resented the low strength at   which spirits were being sold (coupled of course with high prices)   and that the result had been,  as was long since predicted to the   Central .control Board,  that the lowered strength of spirits had   broughyabcut &quot;double dram&quot; drinking.         It may therefore be of interest to you to peruse the en-   closed copy of a Resolution which was deposited with the Central   Control Board (liquor Traffic) on Tuesday last by way of answer   to the Board&apos;s suggestion to issue still another,  and therefore   a Third successive order,  tampering with the quality of bottled   spirits by the addition of still more water.                              I am,  My. Lord,                                  Yours respectfully,                                  (Sgd-)  J.  KING STEWART,                                                      Secretary.Rt. Hon. Lord Rhondda,Ministry of Food,   palace Chambers,       WESTMINISTER.                           ENCLOSURE II,         RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE WHISKY ASSOCIATION TO THE        CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAFFIC) REGARDING THE               PROPOSED FURTHER DILUTION OF SPIRITS.        At a Joint Conference of the Committee of the Wine and   Spirit Association and the Council of the Whisky Association at   which representatives of other interested Bodies v/ere present   held on the 25th March, 1918,  which Conference was called to   consider an intimation from the Central Control Beard (Liquor   Traffic) that that Board had under consideration the issue of an   Order to make dilution to 36 u.p. compulsory in the case of   bottled spirits and to alter the permissible dilution of bulk   spirits to 42 u.p. it was RESOLVED unanimously:-              THAT THE TRADE COULD NOT AGREE TO REDUCE THE              STRENGTH OF HIGH CLASS BOTTLED SPIRITS BEYOND              30 u.p., for the following, amongst other,              reasons:-
     (a)  That undue dilution, apart altogether from the diffi-culty of securing clarify is aos-olutrejy ruijxous to the qualityof high class spirits  and it is upon quality that the reputa-tion and &quot;business guudY/ill of the distillers, importers andbottlers of such brands of spirits has been founded.     (b)  That the whole position was fully explained in a mrlrrt^j,Memorial to the Central Control Board (liquor Traffic) da-teaApril 1916, and at Trade Deputation Interviews with the Board on1st May, of the same year (the result of these Interviews was thatthe owners of high class spirits were induced at that date toacquiesce in the addition of water to an extent which reduced suchspirits from 2o u.p..to 25 u-p,); that subsequent Trade interviewswith the Board as to the question of dilution took place on the24th and 31st October 1916 (as a sequel to these subsequent Inter-views,  further dilution with water from 25 u.p. to 30 u.p. Y/ascompulsorily imposed upon the owners of high class spirits againsttheir judgment and desire and resulting in undoubted detriment toquality and consequent dissatisfaction to the Public).     (c)  That, as the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic)has already been assured, while Distillers and Blenders ofwhisky and Importers of Brandy and others interested are not pre-pared to yield pride of place to any section of the community intheir spirit of patriotism, and are willing to face any reasona-ble sacrifice which will contribute to&apos;the Nation&apos;s efficiencyduring war time, they confidently submit that the Central ControlBoard (Liquor Traffic) has shewn, and can shew, no reasonablejustification even from a war time standpoint,  for the proposedfurther reduction in strength of high class spirits.     (d)  That in the absence of sufficient war time justifica-tion for the further dilution contemplated in relation to highclass spirits, the owners of such spirits contend that,  in thelanguage of the Pood and Drugs Act,  the public have an inde-feasible right to oe served &quot;with an article of the nature,quality and substance demanded&quot;; that such owners, who,  as amatter of.fact, have spent vast sums in creating a reputationfor quality throughout the world,- cannot consent to ruin suchquality nor to be degraded into becoming vendors of &quot;water andwhisky&quot; or &quot;water and brandy&quot;, as the case may be; and that theywill have no option in the event of further dilution being com-pulscrily imposed upon them,  but to adopt such a course as willmake it plain to the public that the responsibility must liesolely with the authorities for any further degradation of thequality of high Class whisky and Brandy,  and for the publicresentment which, in their opinion,  will inevitably be created.
