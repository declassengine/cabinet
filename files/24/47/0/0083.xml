LETTER  OF  TRANSMISSION                            FROMTHE  CHAIRMAN  OF  THE   IRISH  CONVENTION                             TO                THE  PRIME  MINISTER. The Right Honorable D. LLOYD GEORGE, M.P.,               Prime  Minister,                            10  Downing Street,                                    London, SIR,     I have the honour to transmit  herewith the Report  of the Proceedings of the- Irish Convention.     For the immediate object of the Government the Report tells all that needs to  be told :  it shows  that in the Convention, whilst it was not found possible to overcome  the objections  of  the Ulster Unionists,  a  majority  of Nationalists,  all the Southern Unionists, and five out of the seven Labour representatives were agreed that the scheme  of  Irish self-government set out  in Paragraph 42 of  the Report. should  be immediately passed into law.  A minority of Nationalists  propose  a scheme which differs in only one important particular from that of the  majority. The Convention has, therefore, laid a foundation of Irish agreement unprecedented in historv.     I recognise that action in Parliament upon the result of our deliberations must largely  depend upon public  opinion.  Without a  knowledge of the  circumstances which, at the termination of our proceedings, compelled us to adopt an unusual method of presenting the results of our deliberations; r/^he public might be misled as to what  lias  actually been achieved.  It is, therefore, necessary  to  explain  our procedure.     We had every reason to believe that the Government contemplated immediate legislation upon the results  of our labours.  The work of an Irish settlement, sus- pended at the outbreak of the war, is now felt to admit of no further postponement. In the Dominions and in the United States, as well as in other allied countries, the unsettled Irish Question is a disturbing factor, both in regard to war effort and peace aims.  Nevertheless, urgent as our task was, we could not complete it until every possi- bility of agreement had been explored.  The moment this point was reached and you will not be surprised that it  took us eight months to reach it -we  decided to issue our Report with  the least possible delay.  To do this we had to avoid further con- troversy and protracted debate. I was, therefore, on March 22nd, instructed to draft a Report which  should be a mere narrative of the Convention^ proceedings, with a statement, for the information of the Government, of the conclusions adopted, whether unanimously  or by majorities.     It was hoped that this Report might be unanimously signed, and it was under- stood that any groups or individuals would be free to append to it  such statements as they deemed  necessary to give  expression to their views.    The Draft Report
was circulated on March 3.0jbli, and discussed and amended on April 4th and 5th.The accuracy of, the narrative was not challenged, though there was considerabledifference of opinion as to, the relative prominence which should be given to someparts of the proceedings.  As time pressed, it was decided not to have any discussionupon a Majority Report, nor upon any Minority Reports, or other statements whichmight be submitted.   The Draft Report was adopted  by a majority,  and  theChairman and Secretary were ordered to sign it, and forward it to the Government.A limit of twenty-four hours  was, by  agreement, put  upon the reception of  anyother reports  or statements,  and in the afternoon of April 5th the Conventionadjourned sine die. .    The public is thus provided with no Majority Report, in the sense of a reasonedstatement in favour of the conclusions upon which the majority are agreed, but isleft to gather from the narrative of proceedings what the contents of such a reportwould have been.    On the other hand, both  the Ulster Unionists and a minorityof the Nationalists  have presented Minority Reports  covering the  whole field  ofthe Convention^  enquiry.    The result  of this procedure  is  to  minimise  theagreement reached,  and to emphasise the disagreement.   In  these circumstances,I conceive it to be my duty as Chairman to submit such explanatory observationsas are required to enable the reader of the Report and the accompanying documentsto gain a clear idea of the real effect and significance of the Convention^ achievement.    I may assume  a knowledge of the broad facts  of the Irish Question.  It  willbe agreed that, of  recent years, the greatest, obstacle to its settlement  has beenthe Ulster difficulty.  There seemed to be two possible issues to our deliberations.If a scheme of Irish self-government  could be  framed to which the Ulster Unionistswould give their adherence, then the Convention might produce a unanimous Report.Failing such a consummation, we might secure agreement, either  complete or  sub-stantial, between the Nationalist, the Southern Unionist and the, Labour representa-tives.   Many entertained the hope that the  effect of such a  striking  and whollynew development wrould be to induce Ulster to reconsider its position.    Perhaps unanimity was too much to  expect.  Be this as it may, neither timenor effort was  spared in striving for that goal, and there were moments when itsattainment  seemed  possible.   There was, however, a portion of Ulster where amajority claimed that,  if Ireland had the right, to separate  herself from the  restof the United Kingdom, they had the same right to separation from the rest of Ireland.But the time had gone by when any other section of the Irish people would acceptthe partition of their country even  as a temporary expedient.  Hence, the UlsterUnionist members in the Convention  remained there only in the hope that some formof Home Rule would be proposed which might modify the determination of thosethey  represented to have  neither  part nor lot  in  an  Irish Parliament.  TheNationalists strove  to win them by concessions ; but they found themselves unableto accept any of the schemes discussed and the only scheme of Irish governmentthey  presented to the Convention was confined to the exclusion  of their  entireProvince.*See Appendix
    Long before the hope of complete unanimity had passed, the majority of theConvention were considering the&apos; possibilities of agreement between&apos;the Nationalistsand the Southern Unionists.    Lord Midleton was the first to make  a concreteproposal to this end.   The Report shows that in November he outlined to the GrandCommittee, and in  December brought before the Convention, what looked like aworkable compromise.    It accepted self-government  for Ireland.   In return forspecial minority representation in  the Irish  Parliament,  already conceded by theNationalists, it offered to that Parliament complete power over internal legislationand administration and,in matters of finance,     over direct taxation and Excise.But, although they agreed that the Customs revenue should be paid into the IrishExchequer, the Southern Unionists insisted upon the permanent reservation to theImperial Parliament of the power  to fix the rates of  Customs duties.  By far thegreater part of our time  and attention was occupied by this one question, whetherthe imposition of Customs duties should or should not be under the control of theIrish Parliament.    The difficulties of the Irish Convention may be summed up intwo words Ulster and  Customs.    The Ulster difficulty the whole world knows ;  but how the Customs questioncame to be one of vital principle, upon the decision of which depended the amount ofagreement that could be reached in the Convention, needs to be told.  The tendencyof recent political thought among constitutional Nationalists has  been towards aform of government resembling as closely as possible that  of the Dominions, and,since the geographical position of Ireland imposes obvious restrictions&apos;in  respect ofnaval and military affairs, the claim for Dominion Home  Rule was concentratedupon a demand for unrestricted fiscal powers.   Without separate Customs and ExciseIreland would, according to this  view, fail to attain a  national status  like, thatenjoyed by the Dominions.     Upon this  issue the  Nationalists  made  a  strong case,  and  were  ableto  prove that a considerable number of  leading commercial  men  had come to favour fiscal  autonomy as part  of an  Irish  settlement.  In  the  present state of public opinion in Ireland, it was  feared that without Customs no scheme the Con- vention recommended  would receive a sufficient measure  of  popular support to secure legislation.   To  obviate any serious disturbance of the trade of the United Kingdom, they were prepared to agree to  a free trade arrangement  between the two countries.  But this did not overcome the difficulties of the Southern Unionists, who  on this point agreed with the Ulster Unionists.  They were apprehensive that a separate sj^stem of Customs control, however guarded, might impair the authority of the United Kingdom over its  external trade policy. Neither could they consent to any settlement which was, in their  judgment, incompatible with  Ireland&apos;s full participation in a scheme of United Kingdom federation, should that come to pass.     It was clear that by means of mutual concessions agreement between the Nationa- lists and the Southern Unionists could be reached on all  other points.  On this im- portant point, however, a section of the Nationalists, who have embodied then views in a separate Report, held that no compromise was possible.   On the other hand, a majority  of the Nationalists and the whole  body of Southern Unionists felt that nothing effective could result from their work in the Convention unless some under- standing was reached upon Customs which would render an agreement on a complete scheme attainable.  Neither side was willing to surrender  the principle ;  but both
sides were willing, in order that a Parliament should be.at once established,.to post-pone a legislative decision upon the ultimate control of  Customs and Excise.   Atthe same time each party  has put on. record, in  separate notes subjoined, to  theReport, its claim respecting the final settlement of this question.   A decision havingbeen reached upon,.the cardinal issue, the majority of the Convention carried a seriesof resolutions; which together form a complete scheme of self-government.    This scheme provides for the establishment of a Parliament for the whole ofIreland with an Executive  responsible to it, and with  full powers over all internallegislation,  administration and direct  taxation.    Pending a decision of  the fiscalquestion, it is  provided that  the imposition of duties of Customs and Excise shallremain with the Imperial Parliament, but that the whole of the  proceeds of thesetaxes shall be paid into the  Irish Exchequer.  A joint Exchequer Board is to be setup to determine the Irish true revenue, and Ireland is to be represented upon theBoard  of Customs and Excise of the  United Kingdom.    The principle of representation in the Imperial Parliament  was insisted uponfrom the first by the  Southern Unionists,  and the Nationalists conceded it.   Itwas felt, however, that there were strong reasons for providing that the Irish repre-sentatives at Westminster  should be  elected by the Irish Parliament rather thandirectly  by the constituencies, and this was the arrangement adopted.    It was accepted in  principle that  there  should  be  an Irish contributionto the cost of Imperial services but, owing to lack of data, it was not  found  possiblein the  Convention to fix any definite  sum.    It was agreed that the Irish Parliament should consist of two Houses a Senateof 64 members  and a House of Commons of 200.  The principle underlying  thecomposition of the Senate is the representation of interests. This is effected by givingrepresentation to commerce, industry,  and labour, the County Councils, the ^lurches, Clearned institutions and the  Peerage.   In constituting the House of Commons  theNationalists offered to guarantee forty per cent, of its membership to the Unionists ^It was agreed that, in  the South, adequate representation for  Unionists could onlybe secured by nomination  ;  but,  as  the  Ulster representatives  had informed  theConvention that those  for whom they sj)oke could not accept  the principle ofnomination, provision was made in the scheme for an extra representation of Ulsterby direct election.    The majority of the Labour representatives associated themselves with  theNationalists and Southern Unionists in building up  the  constitution,  with  theprovisions  of  which they found themselves in general agreement.  They franklyobjected, however, to the principle of  nomination and to what they regarded as theinadequate  rej)resentation  of Labour in the Upper House.   Throughout our pro-ceedings they helped in every way  towards the attainment of agreement.  Nordid they press their own special claims in such a manner as to make more difficultthe work, already difficult enough, of  agreeing upon  a constitution.     I trust I have said enough to enable the reader of this Report and the accom- panying documents to form an accurate judgment upon the nature  and difficulties of the task before the Convention  and upon its  actual achievement.    While, technically, it was  our function to draft a constitution for our country, it would be more correct to say that we had to find a way out of the most complex and anomalous. political situation to be found in history I might almost say in fiction.   We are living under a system of government  which survives only because the Act abolishing
I have the honour to be,                           SIR,                 Your obedient servant,                         HORACE PLUNKETT.it cannot,&apos; eoiisistently with Ministorial pledges, be. put into operation without furtherlegislation,  ho less difficult and  controversial than  that  which it has to  amend.While the responsibility for a solution to  our  problem rests primarily with theGovernment, the Convention found itself in full accord with your insistence thatthe most hopeful path to a settlement was to  be found in Irish agreement.1  Inseeking this in attempting to find a compromise which Ireland might accept andParliament pass into law it has been recognised that the full programme of no partycould be adopted.  The Convention  was also bound to give due weight to your opinion that to press for a settlement at Westminster, during  the war, of the question which, as I have shown, had been a formidable obstacle to agreement would be to imperil the prospect of the early establishment of self-government in  Ireland.     Notwithstanding the difficulties with which we were surrounded,  a  larger measure of agreement has been reached upon  the  principle and details of Irish self-government than has ever, yet been attained.   Is it too much to hope that the scheme  embodying this agreement will forthwith be brought to fruition by those to whose call the Irish Convention has now responded ?

The nature of the task which the Irish Convention was called into existenceto perform is described in the letter which the Prime Minister addressed to the lateMr.  John Redmond on the 16th May, 1917,  This letter is reprinted as the FirstAppendix to this Report.    In  the letter of invitation which the Prime Ministeraddressed to the members of the Convention the scope of its work is described in thewords quoted below :     &quot; The terms of reference to the Convention are set forth in the folio whig passagefrom a letter on the subject which was lately addressed to the leaders of the principalIrish parties in the House of Commons :          &apos; Would it be too much to hope that Irishmen  of all creeds and parties    might meet together in a Convention for the purpose of drafting a constitution    for their country which should secure a just balance of all the opposing interests,.    and finally  compose the unhappy discords which have-so long distracted Ireland    and impeded its  harmonious development ? &apos;  I  further referred to this matter in the House of Commons in these words :         &apos; The Government therefore propose to summon immediately on behalf  of    the Crow  a Convention of representative Irishmen in Ireland, to  submit to    the British Government a constitution  for the future government of Ireland    within the  Empire.&apos;&quot;    2. Invitations were extended to the  Chairmen of the thirty-three  CountyCouncils,  the Lord  Mayors  or  Mayors  of  the six County  Boroughs;  whilst theChairmen of the Urban  Councils throughout Ireland were requested to  appointeight representatives,  two from each province.  The Irish Parliamentary Party,the  Ulster Parliamentary Party and the  Irish Unionist Alliance were each invitedto nominate five representatives.   An invitation was extended  to  the  Roman.Catholic Hierarchy to appoint four representatives; the Archbishop of Armaghand the Archbishop of Dublin were appointed to represent the Church of Ireland,and the Moderator of  the General Assembly to represent the Presbyterian Churchin Ireland.   Lwitations were also extended to the Chairmen  of the Chambers ofCommerce of Dublin, Belfast and  Cork,  and to Labour  organisations, and therepresentative peers of Ireland were invited to select two of their number.  Allthese invitations  were accepted except  by  one Chairman  of a County Council.Invitations -  intended to  secure representation  of the Sinn Fern  party and theAll  for Ireland party were declined, as were the invitations extended to the TradesCouncils of Dublin and Cork.   Subsequently, in addition to one member  selectedto represent the  Trades  and  Labour  Council  of  Belfast,  six  persons  wereappointed to represent  various labour  organisations,  and fifteen other personswere nominated  by  the  Government,  making- the total  membership  of  theConvention  ninety-five.*  During the course  of its  proceedings the Convention &apos;lost  three of its members by death (Sir Henry Blake,  Mr.  Redmond, and SirAlexander McDowell),  and two by resignation (Mr. Lysaght and Mr. RusseU) whichreduced the  number to ninety.    3. The first meeting  of the Convention was held oii July 25th, 1917,in the Regent Convention,House, Trinity  College, which, together  with a large  number of rooms for offices, ist to 4th Sessionshad, by the courtesy  of the Provost and Fellows of Trinity College, been placed Jqdy 25th&apos;Au^ 9th-st the disposal  of the Convention.   The Chair was taken by the Chief Secretary,ylio delivered an address, and the Convention then proceeded to elect Sir HoracePlunkett  as Chairman,  and  Sir Francis  lopwood, now Lord  Southborough, as* A list of the members of the  Convention Secretario, and Committees will be found in Appendix II.                                                          .   . - .

Secretary.  The second, third, and fourth meetings were occupied with the adoptionof  Standing  Orders, the consideration of  the general  course  of  procedure to befollowed, and the appointment of a Grand  Committee of twenty members for thepurpose of consulting with the Chairman as to the general procedure to be adoptedby the Convention, and of exercising such powers as might from  time to time bedelegated to it by the Convention.  This Committee held twenty-two meetings.    4. The procedure adopted by the Convention was  carefully thought out, andis fully explained in the letter of  the Chairman  to  the  members,  dated  17thAugust, 1917, which is  printed as the Third Appendix  to this  Report.   Its objectwas to ensure the fullest and  frankest expression  of opinion,  to  enable membersto know each other&apos;s point of view and, at the same  time, to avoid  raising con-tentious issues in such a way as to divide the Convention upon party lines.    Thisend was successfully attained by means of what came to be called the PresentationStage.   It was  decided that  the  various schemes for the future government ofIreland which  had been submitted to the Convention, whether by  members orby  persons who  were  not members,  should be  first   considered by   the  GrandCommittee.  All the schemes  that this body thought suitable for discussion  werethen to be presented in turn to the Convention.   While they were being debatedno  decisions  were to be taken, and it  was generally  understood that  criticism,whether destructive or constructive, was to be directed towards their improvement sothat the several proposals should be placed before the Convention in the best form.When this stage had been concluded, the future procedure was to  be decided-bythe Convention.   The speeches made were not officially reported, and the  com-munications issued to the press were worded so as to avoid any undue  or prematuredisclosure of the deliberations of the Convention.  It was thought that under theseconditions a  more unrestrained exchange  of views would be  possible than undercircumstances of greater publicity.    5. A  short adjournment  was  found necessary  in  order  to  enable theGrand Committee to  carry  out the preliminary work,  and  the actual businessof considering proposals for the  future government of Ireland which  the GrandCommittee thought suitable for discussion did not begin until the fifth meetingon  August  21st.    From  this  date  until   the  twenty-second meeting,  onSeptember  27th, the  Convention, which  met  for   three days in   each  week,was  occupied   with   the  general  consideration of  the  schemes  which  hadbeen  presented.  Most of these schemes followed in their main outline  the form ofgovernment  enjoyed by the Dominions, but they  exhibited,  in  a varying  degree,a certain  measure  of  departure,  which was  thought by  their authors  to  benecessitated  by the special  circumstances of Ireland, from  the normal type ofDominion self-government.    In   some  schemes  the  departure  from this  typewas  more marked, and  these plans more  closely  approximated  to  the   HomeRule Bills of 1886 and 1893 and the Government  of Ireland  Act of  1914.   Twoof the schemes provided for the continued representation of Ireland  in the ImperialParliament,  and were  framed with  the special view  of enabling  the  new Irishconstitution  to fit into a future complete federalisation of  the United Kingdom. Several of the schemes  provided that, in addition to a central Irish Parliament, thereshould be established provincial legislatures ; whilst some which favoured the creation of  a  single Irish legislature suggested that the members representing each province in  the Irish  Parliament should be constituted into  a Provincial Grand Committeewith special  powers  of veto,  and possibly  of  initiative, in  respect  of legislation or  administration so far as that province was concerned.*     Most  of the schemesclaimed for an Irish Parliament full control over all Irish taxation, including Customs and Excise.     6. Apart  from the  main question  whether an  Irish  Parliament, with an executive responsible thereto,  should be  established, debate on the schemes  sub- mitted  chiefly  centred on the extent  of the  power  that the  Irish Parliament should possess  over  taxation;  the  question  whether  Ireland should make a statutory  or  voluntary   contribution  to  Imperial  expenditure,  including the national  debt;  the constitution  of the  two  Houses  of  the Irish  Parliament, with special reference to the adequate representation of minorities ;  what power, it any, Ireland should have in connection with defence;  what should be the respec- tive  obligations of the  British and Irish Exchequers with regard to  land purchase; and the question whether there should be provincial legislatures.    *A Memorandum on the subject of Provisional Grand Committees was circulated to  the Con- vention by Lord MacDonnell.
     7.  Of the first  twenty-two  meetings, sixteen were held in Dublin, three in the City Hall, Belfast, and three in the Crawford Technical Institute, Cork.   It was generally felt that the hospitable invitations received from these two cities ought to  be  accepted hi  view  of  the  opportunity  thus  afforded  to  members of familiarising themselves with the widely different  social and economic  conditions which characterise different parts  of the country.   Full advantage  was taken of this opportunity, and it was the opinion of all members that the results  of these two visits in promoting a fuller knowledge and understanding  of Ireland  more than compensated for any delays which they entailed.     8.  Before the sittings in Cork had concluded on September 27th, the following resolutions were carried unanimously:              1. &quot; That on the conclusion of the  debate at the present  sittings of         the Convention, the various  schemes  which have been  submitted to and         discussed in the Convention be referred to the Grand Committee  in order         if possible to prepare a scheme-for submission to the Convention which would         meet the views and difficulties expressed by the different speakers during         the course of the debate.&quot;             2. &quot; That the Convention stand  adjourned after this  week&apos;s sitting         until the Grand Committee is  in a position to report.&quot;     9.  In order that the Grand  Committee might fulfil the task thus delegated to it, the Chairman decided to ask one of its members  to draft the Heads of a Scheme which  might form a basis  of discussion in the Grand Committee and  ultimately be placed before the Convention, if possible, in the form of a complete agreed scheme. Mr. Redmond,  as representing the largest section in the Convention, was  first asked to render this  service, but he preferred that it should be undertaken by someone other than  a political leader.    The  Chairman then  approached the  Bishop of Raphoe, who consented to present the Heads  of a Scheme.     10. A short interval was found necessary  in order to enable preparations for Grand the work of  the Grand  Committee to  be carried out.    That  Committee, which Committee, had been reconstructed  for  its new work, met  on  October  11th,  and  decided ^th Oct., 1917. that the most effective means of carrying out its task would be, in the  first instance, to delegate the duty of  finding a  basis  of  agreement to  a  Sub-Committee of nine members.   Subsequently, on  the  suggestion of  the Chairman, three other Sub-Committees were appointed to deal with Electoral Systems and Areas, Defence and  Police, and Land Purchase.    11. The Sub-Committee of Nine held fourteen meetings, and made  two Reports SOB-Committee to the Grand Committee, an Interim Report dated November 15th  and a Final of Nine, Report dated November 21st. *  The procedure which they followed was  to go through u* 0ct--2lst Nov- seriatim  the Heads of the Scheme referred to above.   They succeeded, as they in- formed  the Grand Committee, in arriving at  certain provisional  conclusions  on most of the Heads, but these provisional understandings were  all contingent on full agreement on the general scheme being reached.    12.

The  Irish Parliament to have no poweri;o make laws on the  following matters:      (1) Crown and succession (Act, sect. 2 (1) ).  The  restrictions are  accepted  generally, sub-ject  to  the  following qualifications:    (2) Making of peace and war (including con-duct as neutrals).  (Act, sect. 2  (2) ).

These were de-    ferred  for  further  consideration,  pending    the  Report  of  the  Sub-Committee  on    Defence.  (4) Treaties and foreign relations  (including3xtradition).    Ireland  to have power similar to  the        dominions  in respect  of commercial        treaties.  (5) Dignities and titles of  honour.Sub-head (4)  is reserved for consideration in    connection with  the general question of    finance, in so far as it gives to Ireland tbe    powers of a Dominion in regard to Com-    mercial Treaties.  (6) Any necessary control of naval harbours,and  certain  powers  as  regards  lighthouses,buoys, beacons, cables, wireless terminals, tobe settled with reference to the requirementsof the Military  and  Naval  forces  of  HisMajesty in various contingencies.Sub-head (6).   It is considered that &quot; control    of harbours  for naval  and military pur-    poses&quot; should be substituted for &quot; control    of naval harbours.&quot;  4. Restrictions  on power of Irish Parlia-ment on matters within its competence.    (1)  Prohibition  of  laws  interfering  with  religious equality (Act,  sect. 3).    N.B.

Constitution  of  House  of  Commons.The  Irish House  of Commons to consist of 168members 162 elected.by constituencies  similarto those set out in the memorandum of the IrishTrades Union Congress, and two each by DublinUniversity,  the   National  University  and theQueen&apos;s University.  The principle  of  proportional representationwith  a single  transferable  vote  to  be observedwherever  a  constituency returns three or  moremembers, and no constituency  to  return  morethan seven.  During  the first ten  years of the Irish Houseof Commons twelve additional  members  to benominated to represent the industries, commerceand  trade of  the  North-east of  Ireland,  andtwelve.to represent the  Southern Unionists.  The House of  Commons to continue for fiveyears unless previously dissolved.  It was  suggested  that the Secretary of theGeneral Assembly might be  added.    In thatevent it was intimated that an addition to theuumber of Roman Catholic Bishops would  beexpected.  It was  also suggested that the  Privy  Coun-cillors selected should  be of two or three  years&apos;standing.  The size of  the  Senate must be considered inrelation to the size of  the Lower House,  and itwas subsequently  considered that if the LowerHouse  came down to 100  or 120 members  itmight be  convenient to reduce the  Senate  to 40members.   This would involve a reconsiderationof the  details  of the above  scheme.  It was agreed that the members of the  UpperHouse should be nominated for, say, seven years.  It was  agreed that  the  Unionists should  beoffered,  by effective means,  a proportion of fortyper cent,  in the Lower House; and that  in theUpper  House of,  say, forty, thirty should  bemen with a substantial stake in  the  country.The exact method of  arriving at this result wasleft for  further consideration,  but it was agreedthat it  could  only be obtained  by  including asubstantial number of  nominated members.  Itwas suggested that, in  order to reduce to a  mini-mum this  undemocratic  element  in the House,the size of the  House should be smaller thanthat proposed  in the scheme.  It was stipulated that  the nominated elementin the Lower House should continue for not lessthan ten years.  Lord &quot;Midleton  suggested  that,  on  the dis-appearance of this nominated element,  an  addi-tion should be&apos; made to  the numbers  of the UpperHouse.    This might be done and was  reserved&apos;for further consideration.   N.B. The interim  Report of the Sub-Corn-mittee of Nine stated that after these provisionalconclusions had been arrived at (1th Nov.), it wasconsidered desirable that the  Ulster representa-tives should communicate  with their  AdvisoryCommittee with  a view to discovering how far thearrangement proposed with regard to the  composi-tion of the two Houses of Parliament was likelyto prove acceptable.   Having taken this course,

They                                   considered,  that the proposal to  include nomi-                                   natcd members to represent Southern Unionists                                   could be defended arid might be accepted, but the                                   same considerations  did  not apply  in the case of                                   Ulster.   The. Ulster representatives undertook to                                   submit proposals for safeguarding the  interests of                                   Ulster by means other than the extra  rcpresenia-                                   tion which had been contemplated.*  11. Money Bills.  Money bills to originate onlyin the House of Commons and not to be amendedor rejected  by the House of Lords (Act, sect.10).  12. Disagreements  between Houses.   -Dis-agreements  between the two Houses to be solvedby joint sittings as set out in Act (sect.  11).  13. Representation at Westminster.  Repre-sentation in the Parliament of the United King-dom to  cease until there is a federal parliament.  It was agreed that  the  Senate should  havepower to force a joint sitting of both Houses overmonev bills.  14. Finance.  The provision (No. 2 above) asto the powers of  the Irish Parliament gives  itcomplete control over finance, including customsand  excise.  An Irish  exchequer and consolidated fund tobe established and an Irish Controller and Audi-tor-General  to be appointed  as  set  out in Act(sect, 14 (1) and sect. (21).  If necessary, it should be  declared  that alltaxes at present leviable in Ireland should  con-tinue to be levied and collected until the IrishParliament  otherwise decides.  The  necessary  adjustments  of  revenue asbetween Great  Britain  and Ireland&apos; during thetransition period should be made.  15. As  soon as may  be  after the  passing  ofthe  Act a joint Commission,  one-half the mem-bers of which shall be chosen to represent Irelandand the other half  to represent Great  Britainshall be appointed by His Majesty to negotiateand agree upon  a  trade, postal,  and  customsunion between Great Britain and Ireland, whichshall aim at securing and promoting the mutualinterests of both  countries in all  such matterswhere their interests are common, or connectedor parallel or  capable of being united for mutualadvantage;  and in  other matters  where theirinterests are separate or competitive to providefor the fair pursuit  of these interests with theleast prejudice  to-both  countries.               /Agreed. Representation at Westminster. The Unionistrepresentatives intimated that this was a sine quanon.  On the Nationalist side it was stated that,while they did not  favour the continuance ofrepresentation in the Imperial Parliament, pend-ing Federation of the United Kingdom, they didnot look upon its cessation as a sine qua non.  It was  agreed that any  Irish representativesao Westminster must have full power to deliber-ate and vote on all questions.  The question whether Irish representatives atWestminster should be directly elected or dele-gated by  the  Irish Parliament was reserved forfurther consideration.  It was suggested that thepresence  of a  nominated  element in the  IrishHouse of Commons would probably  give theUnionists for  a time larger representation in  adelegation appointed  by that  House  than bymembers  directly elected.  Reserved for  further consideration.  The Nationalist Representatives were preparedto accept  a  guarantee of Free  Trade betweenGreat Britain  and Ireland, at any rate  for  aterm  of years.   The Unionists were of opinionthat such a guarantee was inconsistent with theIrish  control of Customs and Excise* Thesejproposals were not submitted under the\:irrumstances explained in Appendix IV.

Every modification or  re-moval shall in like manner be submitted to bothparliaments, and be subject to their approval.  If the Commission fails to arrive at an agree-ment,  or  if  the convention  agreed  upon  isdisapproved of by either parliament,  the mostfavoured nation terms in  force  relating  to  thematter  in question,  whether  with   a  foreigncountry or with  a  dominion government, shallbecome operative as  between both countries, andshall  be brought into force  by  a  proclamation-of His Majesty.  16.  Imperial Contribution .  The Irish  Parlia-ment  shall  fix the  contribution which Irelandshall make to the cost of Imperial defence andadministration,   considering  the financial andeconomic ability of her population,  and the pro-tection  which Ireland receives  from  the armyand navy.  The over-taxation of Ireland  in thepast and her share in the national  debt may  beset off against  each  other.

Future loans to be made on the credit of theIrish Government,  or  if  satisfactory  arrange -ments can be made, on the credit of the ImperialGovernment.  An equitable  scheme of land purchase  thatwould be compulsory on owner and tenant alike,where  voluntary bargains  are not forthcomingafter a certain period, could be sanctioned.  Thetotal provision for excess  stock and bonus  atpresent  amounts to   800,000  a  year.  The  subsidy  from the tax payer for pendingagreements will,  owing to  changes in the priceof money, be at a much greater rate  in pendingcases than it was in the cases already  completed.Another million, or more,  may be  needed forthe unsold areas.  The whole obligation is largelyJin Imperial one,  and Ireland should get creditfor discharging it  in considering the question ofan Imperial contribution.  18. Judicial Power.  The following provisions-of the Government of Ireland Act to be adopted:     (a) Safeguarding  position  of  existing Irish          Judges (Act, sect. 32).     (b) Leaving  appointment  of future Judges          to the. Irish Government  and their          removal to  the Crown on  address          from both Houses of Parliament (Act,          sect.  27).  Reserved for consultation with the Sub-Com-mittee investigating this question.  Agreed, conditionally upon the Unionists hav-ing effective representation in the Irish Parlia-ment.  It was agreed that the Lord Chancellorshould not  be a political officer, but  that  hissalary as Speaker of the Senate should be placedon the Estimates.

Provision should be made for ensuring that inthe future the salaries of Irish public  officials,appointed after the passing of the Act,  shall beupon a scale appropriate to Ireland.  21. DEFERRING TAKING  OVER  CERTAIN  IRISHSERVICES.  Arrangements to be made to permitthe Irish Government, if they so desire, to defertaking  over the services relating to Land  Pur-chase,  Old  Age Pensions,  National Insurance,Labour Exchanges, Post Office, Trustee SavingsBanks, and Friendly Societies.  It was agreed that the salary of the LocLieutenant should be sufficient to throw the po&apos;open to men not of great wealth.  It was agreed that  the Lords Justices shoulbe subject to no  religious disqualifications.  It was agreed that a strong Civil Service Coimission should  be established, and the followicomposition was  suggested: -  Lord  Chancellor, Chairman;  two permane;members appointed  by  the  Lord Lieutenanjand  holding office during good  behaviour.

It will be seen that on the majority of the above Heads there was no marldisagreement in the Sub-Committee  of  Nine,  though it  was found necessaryreserve certain Heads or parts of Heads (viz., Head 3, sub-heads (3) and (4), He^9, 10, 13-17 and 21) for further consideration.   On two Heads, 14 and 15  deal&apos;with Finance, agreement  could not be  reached, and it was the  divergent vieheld on this matter which prevented  the Sub-Committee from reaching that fagreement on  the  general scheme  which was required  to  remove the contingcharacter  of  the conclusions arrived at on the other points.     14. The position of the  Sub-Committee of  Nine as regards the fiscal issueset out in Appendix IV. and may be summarised as follows :      The Scheme presented contemplated that, pending federation of the United KJdom, there should be no Irish representation in the Imperial Parliament, and provifor the exercise by the Irish Parliament of complete control over  finance, incluCustoms  and Excise,  and suggested the  appointment of a Commission to negotia Trade,  Postal, and  Customs Union  between  Great -Britain and  Ireland. ^ fUnionist  representatives: demurred  to  these proposals, those  from Ulster insistthat full  control over finance should be left to the Imperial Parliament, whileSouthern  Unionists were prepared to  agree that  Excise might  be the  subjecspecial consideration.
     15.  Lord SouthborOUgh, in an endeavour to find a compromise, submitted to the Sub-Committee  of Nine certain proposals for giving to the Irish Parliament full control of taxation,  subject to an arrangement for Free Trade between Great Britain and Ireland, and special provisions to meet the case of dumping (see Appendix IV., Schedule III.).   Lord Southborough also submitted further proposals, which were a development of a suggestion previously made by Lord Midleton, that Customs should be reserved to the Imperial Parliament and that Excise should be specially &quot; considered.   Under  these proposals  (see  Appendix IV.,  Schedule VIII.)  the imposition of Customs  Duties would  remain with the Imperial Parliament, the collection would be carried out under the authority of a Joint Board, and an Irish contribution to Imperial  Services would be made a first charge against the Customs revenue.   The remaining sources  of  revenue would be  under the control of the Irish Parliament.     16.  It was not found possible to reach an agreement upon these lines, and it was feared that the Sub-Committee of Nine might have no alternative but to report to  the Grand Committee to that  effect.   The Chairman of the Convention was, however, anxious that the Sub-Committee should make a closer examination of the arguments on the one side and the  other.   He embodied this view in a letter dated November 6th, enclosing certain questions addressed to the Ulster and Nationalist representatives respectively, with a list of possible compromises (see Appendix IV., Schedule IV.).     17. Two sets of  replies were submitted by the Nationalist representatives, one signed by four members (see Appendix IV., Schedule V.), the other by one member (see Appendix IV., Schedule  VI.).   The signatories of the former set.demanded fiscal autonomy  (including  control over Customs and Excise  as well as  direct taxation) similar to that enjoyed by self-governing colonies, but they were prepared to agree to an arrangement for securing for a term of years free trade between Great Britain and Ireland, except in excisable articles, with  a proviso against dumping. The reasons which made them miwilling to  accept  any smaller measure of  Irish control  over  taxation will be found  in their  answers.   These  also  contained alternative proposals for meeting the fears of Unionists in respect of fiscal autonomy.     18. The Nationalists replies were communicated to the Ulster representatives, and considered by them.   They felt that in the circumstances the divergence of views disclosed was  so great that no useful purpose  would be served by a formal reply to the questions submitted to them, and on  November 14th they addressed  to the Chairman of the Convention a letter  containing a general statement  of their attitude on the financial problem, and declaring their opinion that for Ireland and for  Great Britain a common system of Finance, with one Exchequer, was a  funda- mental essential (see  Appendix IV., Schedule VII.).    19. The Chairman did not consider it  necessary to address any questions to the representative of the Southern Unionists, who occupied an intermediate position, Lord Midleton having  already, on their behalf, put  forward a suggestion that Customs  should be reserved to the  Imperial Parliament, and that  Excise should be specially  considered.   .    20. In their Final Report of November  21st,  the Sub-Committee of Nine statedthat, in consequence of the  continued divergence of their views on the financial question, their endeavour to  find a basis for agreement had not proved success-ful.    21. In consequence of this report, the Grand Committee, on November 22nd, took GRAND up the task of attempting to frame a scheme for  the future government of Ireland. Committee, Eight meetings were held between November 22nd  and December  13th ; the p^e^er im&apos;proceedings being interrupted during the first week in December owing to the Parliamentary duties of several members.    22. During these meetings  the Grand Committee  considered the provisionalconclusions which had been reached by the Sub-Committee of Nine on the  Headsof the Scheme submitted to them.  The Report of the Sub-Committee on ElectoralSystems  and  Areas (see Appendix V.) was considered  in connection with  Heads9 and 10 relating to the constitution - of the Senate and the  House of Commons,and the recommendations of the Sub-Committee  were, for  the most part, acceptedand utilised.   In accordance with  the suggestion made by the Sub-Committee of
Nine, a special Sub-Committee was  appointed to  consider the question of consti-tutional amendments.   The Report  made by this Sub-Committee was adopted bythe Grand Committee, and incorporated in Head 5 of their Provisional Conclusions(Appendix  VI.).   As in  the Sub-Committee of Nine,  provisional   agreementscontingent  on the acceptance of a general scheme, were arrived at on most of theHeads,  though  certain  Heads  had to be  reserved  for  future  consideration.^Agreement upon the fiscal issue, however, could not be reached, and the conflict ofopinion on this issue again prevented the attainment of a full agreement on a generalscheme.no        Durmg the proceedings of the Grand Committee, the views of Nationalists infavour of fiscal autonomy, and of Ulster Unionists in favour of fiscal unity, as setforth in  their answers to the Chairman&apos;s inquiries (see Appendix IV.), were furtherexpounded, and Lord Midleton, on the  28th November, on  behalf of the SouthernUnionists, laid before the Grand Committee a memorandum defining their attitudeon this question (see Appendix VII.).   The Grand Committee, however, were unableto reach an  agreement upon the fiscal issue, and they came to the conclusion thatthe matter must be referred to the Convention.Convention, -23rd-36thSessions.18th Dec., 1917,-24th Jan., 1918,     24. Owing to important parliamentary busmess requiring the attendance at West-minster of some members, the Convention could not meet until the 18thDecember,when a statement was made by the Chairman, showing what progress had been madeand what  difficulties encountered (see Appendix VIII.).   The Report of the Sub-Committee of Nines (Appendix IV.) already referred to, was circulated  amongstthe Convention  together with a statement of the provisional conclusions arrived atby the Grand Committee upon the Heads of the Scheme and  the  findings of theSub-Committee of Nine thereon (Appendix VI.). The Reports of the Sub-Committeeson Electoral Systems and Areas, (Appendix V), and on Land Purchase (AppendixIX.) were also circulated; but the principal work  of the Convention during thefourteen meetings held between  the 18th December, 1917 and the 24th January,1918 was the consideration of the fiscal difficulty.    25. In pursuance of his attempt to find a compromise between the demand forcomplete fiscal autonomy for Ireland and the demand for the complete fiscal unityof the United Kingdom,  Lord Midleton on the 2nd January, 1918, introduced thefollowing Resolution :         That, in the event of the establishment of an Irish Parliament, there shall    be reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom  full  authority for all    Imperial services,  including the levying of Customs duties, but subject to the    above  limitations  the Irish Parliament shall control all purely Irish  services,    including Judicature and Police with internal taxation and administration.    26. Lord Midleton&apos;s proposals were amplified from time to time, in a  series ofmemoranda (see Appendix VII.).   He proposed that during  the war the proceedsof Customs and Excess Profits duties should go to the  Imperial Exchequer, theIrish  Exchequer receiving the proceeds of other taxes, and any additional amountthat might be necessary  to cover the ascertained cost of Irish  services.   Subjectto the above, all forms of taxation, including Excise, but excluding Customs duties,were to be  controlled by the  Irish Parliament.   After the  war Customs  dutie.would continue to be imposed under the authority of the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom.   The Imperial Exchequer would, however, retain only  so much of threceipts from such duties as  would represent  a fair  contribution  to the  cost  oImperial services, the amount of such contribution to be determined after enquirjby a Commission representing both  Great Britain and Ireland.    27. Lord  Midleton proposed, further, that a permanent Joint Revenue Boarshould be set up and invested with the following functions :            (1) To determine  the  true Customs  revenue  of Ireland.          (2) To secure co-operation between the revenue authorities  of the. tw      countries  with regard to traffic in excisable articles.* The provisional agreements arrived at are recorded in Appendix VI.
           (3) To determine the respective claims of the British and Irish Govern-       ments to levy direct taxation on the property or income of persons resident       partly in Ireland, partly in Great Britain.           (4) To advise with regard to alleged cases of dumping to the injury of       Irish industries.           (5) To recommend reductions in Customs  duties on  articles of general    -   consumption in Ireland, in the event of the proportion of Customs and Excise       duties to the total tax revenue  hi Ireland exceeding the  similar proportion,       hi the case of Great Britain, by fifteen per cent., hi two  successive years.    28. Various amendments  to  Lord  Midleton&apos;s  resolution were proposed anddiscussed at the meetings of the  Convention on January 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 15th, 16th,17th, 22nd, 23rd and 24th. *   The most important  amendments were  designed towithdraw Customs from the control of the Imperial Parliament, and leave the raisingof all taxes to an Irish Parliament.  Li the course of the debate, Lord Midleton&apos;sproposal, received  support from a number of  Nationalist  members,  who, whileretaining the view that Ireland  ought  to  control  all  sources  of taxation, werewilling to accept his compromise in order to secure agreement; and the majorityof the  Labour representatives expressed their  readiness to follow the same course.On the other hand, a number of Nationalists were unable to accept any arrange-nient which deprived the  Irish Parliament of the control of Customs ; nor did LordMidleton&apos;s proposals meet the objections of the Ulster Unionist representatives.    29. It  therefore became  apparent  that on the  financial issue there were threeclearly defined  bodies  of opinion  in the  Convention:  the  Ulster - Unionists,advocating the maintenance of the fiscal unity of the United Kingdom ;  a section ofNationalists insisting  on complete fiscal autonomy for Ireland;  and the SouthernUnionists, with the  adherence of other  Nationalists and  the majority of the Labourmembers, advancing a compromise which left to Ireland the proceeds of all sourcesof revenue, and the imposition of all taxes other than Customs.  In these circum-stances, the Chairman considered it to be  his duty  to communicate to the Con-vention on January 24th  the following letter  which  the Prime Minister had senthim to use at his discretion :                                    10  DOWNING  STREET,                                          WHITEHALL, S.W.  1.                                                       2\st January,  1918.    DEAR SIR HORACE PLUNKETT.        In our  conversation on  Saturday you told me that  the  situation  hi the    Convention has now reached a very  critical stage.  The  issues  are ^ so  grave    that I feel the Convention  should not come to  a  definite break, without the    Government having the  opportunity  of full consultation  with the leaders of    the different sections.  If, and  when, therefore, a point  is reached at which    the Convention finds  that it can make  no further progress towards an agreed    settlement, I would ask that representatives should be sent  to confer with the    Cabinet.   The  Government  are agreed and determined that a solution must    be found.   But they are firmly convinced that the best hope of a settlement    lies within the Convention and they are prepared to  do anything in  then power    to assist the Convention finally to reach a  basis of agreement, which  would    enable a new Irish  Constitution to come into operation with the consent of all    parties.                                        Yours sincerely,                                                   D.  LLOYD  GEORGE.    *The sessions of the Convention held on the 8th, 9th, and 10th January, 1918, were devoted tothe consideration of the Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase.   (See paragraph 40 infra).                                                                     C 2
                  30. The debate  on Lord 3/Eidleton&apos;s motion  and  on an amendment thereto              moved by the Bishop of Raphoe, claiming control of Customs for the Irish Parlia-              ment,  having been  suspended, the Convention considered the Prime Minister^              letter and, after an exhaustive discussion, passed the  following  resolution :                        &quot; That the Convention thanks the Prime Minister for his letter, and, though                  it  does not feel  the possibilities of agreement are exhausted, it considers that                  they may be  increased by the  acceptance  of his offer, and it  is, therefore,                  nominating delegates  to confer with the Cabinet.&quot; &apos;Delegation ro      31. In accordance with this decision, a Delegation representative of all  sections              proceeded to London, and had interviews severally  and  collectively with the              Prime  Minister  and other  members of the  Cabinet.                  32. The Convention  reassembled for its  thirty-seventh session on the 26th              February, when the Chairman made a report on the interviews that had taken place              between the Delegation and  the  Cabinet, and read the following letter from the              Prime Minister:                                                       10, DOWNING STREET,                                                                       LONDON,  S.W.,                                                                   25th February, 1918.              DEAR SIR HORACE PLUNKETT,                  I had the privilege of  discussing, during the last three weeks, the situation in              the Irish Convention  with  the delegates whom the Convention appointed to confer              with the Government.   You will allow me to thank the Convention for  sendins              over a delegation so representative of all  groups  of opinion within the Convention.              The Government have thereby been enabled to learn the views of different  parties,              and to appreciate better than would otherwise  have been possible the position that              has now been reached within the Convention.   I regret that the urgency  of  ques-              tions vital to the immediate conduct of the war  has protracted the meetings with              various groups longer than  it was hoped would  be necessary, but I am confident the              Convention will recognise the exceptional  circumstances of the time and will under-              stand there has been no avoidable delay.                  The conclusions to which the Government  have come as a result of their inter-              views with the representatives of the Convention may be stated as follows  :                   The Government are determined that, so far as is in their  power, the  labours              of the Convention shall not be in vain.  On receiving the report of the Convention,              the Government will  give  it immediate attention, and will proceed with the least              possible delay to submit legislative proposals to Parliament.   They wish, however,              to emphasise the urgent importance of  getting  a settlement in and through the              Convention.   The  Convention has been  brought together to endeavour to find a              settlement by consent.  If the Convention fails to secure this, the settlement of              the question will be much more difficult, but  it  will be a task incumbent on the              Government.   It is,  therefore, of the highest importance  both for  the  present              situation and for future good relations in and with  Ireland that the settlement              should come from an Irish  assembly, and from mutual agreement among all parties.              To secure this there must be concessions on all sides.   It has been so in every Con-              vention, from that  of the U.S.A. to that  of South Africa.                  There is, however, a further consideration which has an important  bearing on              the possibilities of the present situation.    During the  period of the war it is neces-              sary to  proceed as  far as possible by agreement.   Questions on which there is an              acute difference of  opinion in Ireland or in Great Britain  must be held over for              determination after the war.   At the same time it is  clear to the Government, in              view of previous attempts at settlement, and of the deliberations of the Convention              itself, that the only hope  of agreement lies in a solution which, on the one  side,              provides for the unity of  Ireland under  a single Legislature with adequate  safe-              guards for the  interests of Ulster and the Southern Unionists, and, on the other, f              preserves the well-being of the Empire and the  fundamental unity of the  United              Kingdom.      ;  -Convention,37th49thSessions.26th Feb.-March, 22nd.
    It is evident that there is on the part of all parties in the Convention a willing-ness to provide for and  safeguard the interests of the Empire and of the  UnitedKingdom.   A settlement can now be reached which will reserve by common consentto the Imperial Parliament its  suzerainty, and its control of Army, Navy, andForeign Policy and  other  Imperial services, while providing for Irish represen-tation  at  Westminster, and  for a  proper contribution  from  Ireland to  Imperialexpenditure.   All these  matters are now capable of being settled within  the Con-vention on a basis satisfactory both to the Imperial Government and to Ireland.    There remains, however, the difficult question  of Customs  and Excise.  TheGovernment  are aware of  the serious objections which can be  raised  against thetransfer of these services to an Irish  Legislature.    It would be practically impos-sible  to  make  such a  disturbance of the fiscal  and financial  relations  of GreatBritain and Ireland  in the midst of a great war.   It might  also be incompatiblewith that federal re-organisation of the United Kingdom in favour of which thereis a growing  body of opinion.   On the other hand, the Government recognise thestrong claim  that can be made that an Irish Legislature should have some  controlover indirect taxation as  the only form of taxation which touches the great majorityof  the people, and  which  in the past  has represented the greater  part  of  Irishrevenue.    The Government feel that this is a matter which cannot be  finally settled atthe present time.  They therefore suggest for the consideration of the Conventionthat,  during  the period  of  the  war and for a period of two  years thereafter, thecontrol of Customs and  Excise should be reserved to the United Kingdom Parlia-ment;  that, as soon as  possible after the Irish Parliament has been established, aJoint Exchequer Board  should be set up to secure the determination of the truerevenue of Ireland a provision which is  essential to a system of responsible IrishGovernment  and to the making of a national balance sheet, and that, at the end ofthe war, a Royal Commission should be established to re-examine impartially andthoroughly the financial relations of  Great Britain and Ireland, to report on thecontribution  of Ireland to  Imperial expenditure, and to submit proposals  as to thebest means of adjusting  the economic and fiscal relations of the two countries.    The Government consider that during the period of the war the control of alltaxation other than  Customs and Excise could be handed over to the Irish Parlia-ment;  that, for the  period of the war and two years thereafter an agreed proportionof the annual Imperial expenditure should be fixed  as the  Irish  contribution ;  andthat all Irish revenue from  Customs and Excise as determined by the Joint Ex-chequer Board, after deduction of the agreed Irish contribution  to Imperial expen-cliture, should be paid  into the  Irish Exchequer.   For administrative  reasons,during the period of the war it is necessary that the Police  should remain underImperial control and it seems to the Government  to be desirable that for the sameperiod the Postal service should be a reserved service.     Turning to the other essential element of a settlement the securing of  anagreement to establish a single Legislature for an united Ireland the Governmentbelieve that  the Convention has given much thought to the method of overcomingobjection on the part of Unionists, North and South, to this proposal.   They under-stand that one  scheme  provides for  additional representation by means of nomi-nation or election.   They understand further that it has also been  suggested thata safeguard of  Ulster interests might be secured  by the provision of an UlsterCommittee within the Irish Parliament, with power to  modify, and if necessary toexclude, the  application to Ulster of certain measures either of legislation or admini-stration which are not  consonant with the interests of Ulster.   This appears tobe  a workable expedient,  whereby special consideration of Ulster conditions canbe  secured and the  objections to a single Legislature for Ireland overcome.     The  Government would also point to the fact that it has been proposed that theIrish Parliament should  meet in alternate sessions in Dublin and Belfast, and thatthe principal offices of an Irish Department of manufacturing industry and coni-merce should be located in Belfast.   They  believe that the willingness to  discussthese suggestions is clear evidence of the desire to consider any expedient which mayhelp to remove the  causes of Irish disunion.   The fact that,  in order to  meet theclaims of different parts of the community, the South African Convention decidedthat  the  Legislature was to be established in  Cape Town, the Administrative
Departments to be situated in  Pretoria, and the  Supreme  Court was  to  sit  inBloemfontein, is a proof that proposals such as these may markedly contribute toeventual agreement.    Finally, the Government have noted the very important Report which lias beefprepared on the subject of Land Purchase and  on  which an unanimous conclusionhas been reached by the Committee of the Convention set up to consider this subjectIf this Report commends itself  to the Convention, the Government would be pre-pared to introduce in Parliament as part of the plan of settlement (and sirnulltaneously with the Bill amending the Government of Ireland Act,  1914) a measurlfor the purpose of enabling Parliament to  give effect to the recommendations ofthe Convention on the subject of Land  Purchase.   The Government have also had]submitted  to  them by the  Labour representatives in the Convention the need olprovision  for dealing with  the urgent question  of  housing in  Ireland,  and  oiilreceiving  recommendations  from  the Convention  on the subject they would  mprepared to  consider the inclusion in the scheme of settlement  of  a substantialprovision  for immediately dealing with this vital problem.                      I    There thus seems to be within the reach of the Convention the possibility olobtaining a settlement which will lay the foundation of a new era in the governmenlboth of Ireland and of Great Britain.   It is a settlement which will give to Irish!men the control of their own affairs, while preserving the fundamental unity of tillUnited Kingdom, and  enabling Irishmen to work for the good of the  Empire aJwell as for the good of Ireland.    With  all the  earnestness in  their power  tillGovernment appeal to the members of the Convention to agree upon a scheme wliicljcan be carried out at once and which will go a long way towards realising the hopeJof Irishmen all over the world, without prejudice to the future consideration ojquestions  on which at present agreement cannot be attained in  Ireland and wliicllare also intimately connected with constitutional problems affecting every part olthe United Kingdom, the consideration of which must be postponed till the end olthe present war.   This is an opportunity for a settlement by consent that may nevelrecur, and which, if it  is allowed  to pass, must inevitably entail  consequences folwhich no  man can wish to make himself responsible.                                              Yours sincerely,                                                     D. LLOYD  GEORGE. I                  33.  The consideration of the views expressed by the Cabinet to the Delegatioj              and  by the  Prime  Minister  hi his  letter  occupied the  sessions  of  Februad              26th, 27th and 28th.  It was felt that a new situation had been created, and tlj              discussion was directed to seeing whether the suggestions made in the Prime Minister]              letter could be made the basis of an agreement in the Convention.   One suggestio              was  at  once  adopted, a Committee  being appointed  to  consider under  will              conditions assistance could best be given to Housing in Urban Areas in Ireland.March 5th-6th.      34. On March 5th the Convention decided not to resume the consideration of tlj              motion  introduced by  Lord Midleton on January 2nd, but to take up a resolutioj              which had been submitted by Lord MacDonnell and which, in effect, embodied, wit]              variation hi detail, some of the suggestions contained in the Prime Ministers letted              The first part of this resolution was in  the following terms : The matters specifiej              as unfitted for immediate legislation, namely, control of Customs and Excise by aj              Irish Parliament,  be postponed for further consideration until after the war, on tM              condition that such control  of Customs and Excise by the Irish Parliament sha]              come into effect automatically three years after the cessation of hostilities unle4              the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall otherwise decide.   Another part (j              the resolution proposed that during this interim period the Board of Customs anj              Excise should include a  person, or persons, nominated by the Irish Treasury, anj              also  provided for the creation of a Joint  Exchequer Board  to  secure the detei              mination of  the true revenue of  Ireland.    These propositions raised in a defini!              form the fiscal issue which had  been  debated at length in  the Convention, &amp;&quot;              during the Presentation-Stage, then on Lord Midleton&apos;s motion of the 2nd Januaf,              and the amendments thereto, and finally on the Prime Ministers letter.-Convention,26th-28thFebruary.
o   35. The  consideration of Lord MacDonnelTs  motion was  postponed owing 42nd-49th , Mr  Redmond&apos;s death  and the adjournment  until  after  the funeral.   When Sessions. 4e Convention re-assembled on March 12th the first part of Lord MacDonnelTs March 12th-22nd Solution (see Appendix  X.) appeared in another  form.   It proposed that the ^ position  of Customs and  Excise should be under the control of the ImperialParliament during the war  and thereafter until the question  of such  controlIiad been considered and  a  decision arrived  at. by the Imperial Parliament, thedecision to be taken not later than seven years after the conclusion of peace.   Thefirst part of Lord MacDoniielTs  resolution was put to the vote  and carried by 38 otes to 34-  The text  of the  resolution and full particulars of the amendmentsproposed and divisions taken will be found in Appendix X.   36. The opinion of  the  majority upon the main financial question having nowbeen formally expressed, the Convention decided to resume the consideration of the tatement of provisional  conclusions reached in the Grand Committee (see AppendixV.).  These were considered on the 14th, 15th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and  22nd March.The Heads on  which there was provisional  agreement  in Grand  Committeewere adopted with but little alteration, and  discussion  mainly  centred on thoseHeads  reserved by  the  Grand Committee for consideration  by  the  Convention.Hie text of the  Heads and of the amendments  projiosed and particulars  of thedivisions taken will be found in Appendix XI.   37. One amendment calls for particular notice.   On Head 2,  Mr. Barrie pro-posed to exclude from the power and authority of the Irish Parliament the provinceof Ulster, referred to as &quot; The Excluded Area.&quot;  Mr. Barrie had on  the 12th Marchcirculated an outline of  a  scheme of Irish Government based on the Amending Billof  1914, (see Appendix XIV.), and  had placed  on the Agenda Paper a motionto consider it.  The motion,  however, was not pressed in view of his amendmentwhich raised the  same issue.    This amendment was discussed on March 14th and15th and rejected by 52  votes to  19.  (See Appendix XI).   38. It  will be. remembered that the Grand Committee had  appointed three Sub- wL   0RALCommittees to deal with specific questions.  The Report of the Sub-Committee on Systems andElectoral Systems and Areas (see Appendix V.) was not formally considered by the Areas.Convention, but  its recommendations were discussed in connection with the con-stitution of the Senate and  the  House of Commons and were largely incorporatedin the proposals adopted by the Convention under these Heads.   39. The Report of the Sub-Committee on Defence  and Police (see  Appendix Defence andXV.) was considered by the  Convention and  adopted on 14th March by 54 votes Police.to 17.    The amendments proposed and the divisions  thereon  are  recorded  inAppendix XII.   40. The Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase,  which was accepted Land Purchasein principle by the Grand Committee, had been discussed in the Convention  on the8th, 9th and  10th  January, and certain suggested amendments were referredto the Sub-Committee for their  consideration.   The final Report of the Sub-Com-niittee (see Appendix IX.) was  considered by the Convention on the 22nd Marchand after  discussion unanimously adopted.   It should be noted that the Reportof the Sub-Committee on Land Purchase, which contains detailed  recommendationsfor a complete settlement  of the agrarian question,  was  based on  the assumptionthat the duty  of  the  Sub-Committee  was to  inquire into the problems  pre-sented  by Land Purchase,  not  under the existing form  of  government, but aspart of a large scheme for  recasting the framework of government  hi Ireland, andthey stated that their recommendations could not be taken as agreed to on anyother hypothesis.   The amendments proposed to the Report on 22nd March, andthe divisions thereon are recorded in Appendix XIII.   4.1. The Report of the Committee appointed, in accordance with the suggestion    Housing.contained in the Prime Ministers letter of the 25th February, 1918, to consider the 51st Session- Iption of Housing in Urban Areas in Ireland (see Appendix XVI.), was considered f the Convention on the  5th April, and unanimously adopted.

The  answer  to  our  Referenceis to be found in the following statement.

                        REPORT                               OFULSTER  UNIONIST   DELEGATES   TO               IRISH   CONVENTION.    1. We, the Ulster Unionist Members  of the Convention, find ourselves unable toconcur in the Chairman&apos;s Draft Report.   We protest against its implication thata measure of agreement regarding Irish Self-Government was attained, which infact was not the case as is evidenced by the record of the Divisions.   The provisionalconclusions on minor matters which were arrived at in Committee were strictlycontingent on agreement on the vital issues.   These were fundamental and uponthem no agreement was at any time visible.   On many of the important questionsthe Nationalists were sharply divided.   All discussions were &quot; without prejudice &quot;and subject to complete agreement being reached on the whole Scheme.  Absolutefreedom of action as regards decision in  Convention on all points was reserved andthis was clearly indicated throughout the  proceedings.    2. In  confirmation  of this  statement  the  following  extract  from  LordMacDonnell&apos;s Memorandum (see Appendix         )  issued to the Convention on8th March, 1918, may be quoted :             &quot;It is true that this report does not bind the Grand Committee, still        less the Convention, even on the points on which no difference of opinion        is recorded, because all the provisional understandings which were arrived        at were contingent on a full agreement on the general scheme being        reached;   and it cannot be said this agreement has been reached.&quot;    3. In order that an accurate estimate may be formed of the origin and purposeof the Irish Convention, it is necessaiy to recall the political situation as it existedin the early summer of 1917.    4. The Home Rule Act of 1914, to  which Ulster was inexorably  opposed, hadbeen placed on the Statute Book, in  disregard of the  truce entered into at the be-ginning of the war, at which time an Amending Bill excluding Ulster from  the Acthad passed through its  initial Parliamentary stages with general consent  and waspostponed in consequence of the European situation.    5. Yielding to  the demands of the Nationalists, the Prime Minister, in a letteraddressed to  Mr. John  Redmond, on 16th May,  1917,  offered :       (a) A &quot; bill for the immediate application of the Home Rule Act to Ireland,            but excluding therefrom the six Counties of North-East Ulster &quot; ;  or,            alternatively,      (b) A Convention of Irishmen &quot; for the purpose of  drafting a  Constitution            for then country .... which should secure a just balance of all the            opposing interests.&quot;    6. Mr. Redmond refused the first proposal, but acquiesced in the suggestion of aConvention, in which Ulster Unionists were invited to join.  On 21st May, 1917, inannouncing  the Governments intention to  summon the Convention, the PrimeMmister said : &quot; No one I want to make this quite clear by the mere fact ofgoing to the Convention  can be assumed  to be pledged to the acceptance or therejection of any particular proposal or method for the Government of Ireland.&quot;
    7. Ulster Unionists felt some natural hesitancy in sending delegates to the Con-vention, but relying absolutely on this pledge, and on further pledges given by thePrime Minister and Mr. Asquith,  that Ulster would not be forced to come under aDublin Parliament, they ultimately consented.   In taking this course the UlsterUnionists were animated by the desire to do what was best for the Empire, for GreatBritain, and for Ireland.   They  were satisfied with the Constitution under whichthey had lived and prospered, and they desired to continue under the Union whichthey still believe to be the  form of Government  best suited to the needs of Irelandand best calculated to maintain  the stability of the Empire.   They were ready,however, to consider any plan that might be put forward, provided it would increasethe happiness and comfort of the people and at  the  same time  maintain thesupremacy of  the  Imperial Parliament.    8. Ulster Unionists, who have thrown themselves whole-heartedlv into the war,deplore the fact that in this great world crisis, when their entire energies  ought  tobe devoted to providing  men and  munitions,  they should be even temporarilydiverted  from  vital national  issues on which the very existence  of the  Empiredepends in order to again  take up a subject the consideration of  which had  beenrightly postponed  on the outbreak of hostilities.    9. In view of  Ulster&apos;s  well-known doubts and fears  and of the undeniable factthat the declared  object of the Convention was to &quot; secure a just balance  of  allopposing interests &quot; it  was not  unnatural to assume that the Nationalists  wereprepared to offer a modus  vivmdi, and formulate proposals of local Parliamentarygovernment for Ireland which would at least:       (1) Provide for  the  absolute supremacy of the Imperial Parliament;      . (2) Maintain the existing fiscal unity;      (3) Guarantee protection for the undoubted rights of the Unionist minority ;      (4) Ensure  the safety of Irish industrial  enterprises, the  vast proportion  of             which are situated in the North-Eastern Counties of Ulster, and from             which the bulk of the Irish Revenue is derived.    10. We expected that the real work of the Convention would have been directedto a sincere and patriotic  endeavour to find common ground somewhere betweenthe 1914 Act on the one hand, and the views of Ulster  on the  other.   From thefirst week in which the Convention sat we urged this course, and repeatedly expressedour disappointment that almost every Nationalist speech outlined a form  of HomeRule  far in advance of any previous claim.    11. The Scheme which was finally brought forward by the Bishop of Raphoe onbehalf of the  Nationalists  included the following demands : -      First A  Sovereign  Independent Parliament for  Ireland  co-equal in power             and authority with  the Imperial Parliament.      Second Complete Fiscal Autonomy for Ireland, including :              (a) Power of  imposing tariffs and  control of Excise,  involving, as  it                   would, the risk of hostile tariffs against Great  Britain and the                   disturbance of free intercourse between the two countries ;             (b) Right of making Commercial Treaties with foreign countries ;             (c) Full powers of direct taxation.      Third Right to raise and maintain a Military (territorial) Force in Ireland.      Fourth Repudiation of any liability for the National Debt on the plea  of             over-taxation of  Ireland in the past.   Subject to the consent of the             Irish Parliament, the principle of a small annual contribution towards             Imperial  expenditure was admitted.

When the Clause claiming Fiscal Autonomy for Ireland was reached, it soon be- eame evident that no real approach towards&quot;.agreement was possible.  At that stao-e the Chairman endeavoured to get over the deadlock by putting a series of questions t6&apos;the Nationalists  and to  the  Ulster Unionists, and the replies sent in  speak for themselves.   Hie real object-of these proposals was clearly apparent in the official reply to the Chairman&apos;s queries of 6th November, signed by the following Nationalist Leaders :-John  Redmond, the Lord Bishop  of Raphoe, Joseph Devlin, George Russell.     13.  In this document the Nationalists again emphatically insisted  upon their demand  for  Ireland&apos;s  fiscal independence, and erystalised their  argument  in the following terms,: &quot; We regard Ireland as a Nation, an economic entity. Self- government &apos; does  not  exist  where  those  nominally  entrusted  with  affairs  of Government have not control of fiscal and economic policy.&quot;     14.  It is,  therefore, clear that Fiscal Autonomy including the control of Customs and Excise and National taxation is valued by the Nationalists  not only on the ground of supposed economic advantage but  as an  essential symbol of National independence.   In Opposition to this Ulster takes a firm stand on  the basis of the people&apos;s  common  prosperity, and maintains that the Fiscal unity of the  United Kingdom must be preserved intact, carrying with it  as  it does the sovereignty of the  Imperial Parliament  and due representation  therein.  ,i  15.; The important question  of how far Ireland should contribute to Imperial taxation raised much controversy.  In the earlier stages of  the discussions some prominent Nationalists stated quite frankly that they recognised no  responsibility for-any portion of  the pre-war National Debt, nor for the present war expenditure, whilst we claimed that in justice and in honour Ireland must continue to pay her full  share  of both.  The majority of  the Nationalists declined  to  admit such liability..  &apos; .  &apos;   16. During the financial year just ended Ireland&apos;s Imperial contribution will, it is estimated, amount to about thirteen millions  sterling, and  possibly to  twenty millions  next  year.   An  important section  of the  Nationalists  objected to any Imperial contribution being paid, but the larger number favoured a contributionranging frdm two&apos;and  a half to four and a half millions sterling per  annum.   Itwas  invariably a condition that the contribution should be purely voluntary and at the pleasure  of the Irish  Parliament.   We listened to these suggestions withkeen disappointment,  knowing of no  reason why Ireland, which is abundantlyprosperous, should hot in the hour of the Empire&apos;s need contribute her  full share of men and nlohey.   We have always contended that there should be equality of sacrifice  in every part  of the United Kingdom.     17. As already pointed out, a further Clause in the Bishop of Raphoe&apos;s Schemewith which we found it impossible to agree claimed that compulsory Military Service could not be imposed upon Ireland by Great Britain unless with the consent of the Irish Parliament,  and  this demand was supported by  a majority  vote  of  the Convention.   1  18. AigaliTit was claimed&apos;that^imcbntradistinction to the provisions of allpre- vious&apos;Home&apos;Rule Bills; the Royal  Irish Constabulary, a semi-Military Force, should immediately at the conclusion of the war come under the control&apos;of the Irish Parlia- nient.  The 1914 Act provided that this Force should remain under Imperial control for a period o^^                                              a proposal must be regardecTas a exdeslively dangerous.&apos;9&apos;!

Failing any evidence of an approach to a narrowing of our differences, and inview of the new demands made and adhered to&quot; by the Nationalists, we were finallyforced to declare  that in any such scheme of  Self-Government for  Ireland Ulster-could not participate.   We cannot  overlook the strong probability that  the con-trolling force in such a Parliament would to-day be the Republican or, Sinn FeinParty, which is openly and aggressively hostile to Great Britain and to the Empire.During recent months in many parts of Ireland, outside of Ulster,  there has beena great renewal of lawlessness, and crime bordering on anarchy, which unfortunatelyhas not been adequately dealt with by the Irish Executive.     20. A most remarkable situation arose in the Convention when a vote was takenon the proposal to adjourn the proceedings until an assurance was received  from theGovernment that  they would promptly take effective steps to restore law and orderand repress outrage throughout Ireland.   Fifty Nationalist Members voted againstthat proposal, and 33 Members, including the  Ulster Unionists, voted for it.     21. A proposal was  brought  forward, under which, in an  Irish ParliamentUnionists should  have a temporary representation largely in excess of what they are-entitled to on the basis of  population.  While appreciating the spirit of this offer itwas felt, after full consideration, that the undemocratic character of this proposalrendered it  wholly unacceptable.     22. On the Land Question a Report  containing valuable suggestions  was sub- mitted by the Committee to which the subject  had been referred.  This Report  was unanimously adopted as there was a desire amongst all sections to have  the greatregenerative scheme of Land Purchase  completed without further delay.     23. The Committee appointed to consider  the urgent necessity for providing- additional Workmen&apos;s houses in Urban Districts  reported in favour of comprehensive- schemes being at once undertaken by the Local Authorities, an  Imperial grant in aid to be provided by the  Treasury.  This Report was also unanimously adopted.     24. We regret that instead of proposals  being made to remove our objections, the polic)&apos;&apos; pursued by the Nationalists in the  Convention strengthened our opinion that Home Rule  would intensify existing divisions  in Ireland and prove a constant menace to the Empire.    Had we  thought that the majority of  the  Convention intended to demand, not  the subordinate  powers contained in previous Home Rule- Bills, but what  is tantamount  to full  national independence, we  could  not  have- agreed to enter the Convention.     25. While firmly  believing that Home Rule would be inimical to the highest interests of Ireland and the Empire, Ulster Unionists, with the object of meeting trie- Nationalists,  presented an alternative scheme for the exclusion of Ulster based on lines agreed to bv the Official Nationalist Party in 1916.     26. The discussions have proved beyond doubt  that the aim of the Nationalists is to establish a Parliament in Ireland which would be practically free from effective- control by the Imperial  Parliament,   It is  only  necessary  to  draw attention to modern political movements to realise the unwisdom  of establishing  within the United Kingdom two  Parliaments having co-equal powers.  All  other  countries have fought against this disintegrating policy.      27. The Australian States, weary of local commercial disputes, combined in one- fiscal unit in which they were joined by Tasmania an Island much akin to Ireland in the matter, of area.      28. The  United States of America established, at  the cost of much blood and treasure, National unity when the Confederacy  claimed, like the  1 rish Nationalists, the right to set up an Independent Government.      29. With these and  other examples  before us  we cannot help  feeling that the- demands put forward, if conceded, would create  turmoil at home and  weakness. abroad.E
                                u    30. One of the many objection to the Scheme presented in the Report is that itwould make the future application of Federalism to the United Kingdom impossible.    31. For the reasons stated we could not accept the proposals put forward by theNationalists.    32. We desire to record our appreciation of the uniform courtesy  and goodfeeling which characterised the proceedings of the Convention throughout.         ::  ^&quot; &quot; &apos;         HUGH T.

NOTE    BY   THE    PROVOST   OF   TRINITY     COLLEGE   AND  THE  ARCHBISHOP  OF     ARMAGH.    We have not found it possible to vote for the conclusion reached by the majorityof the members of this Convention.    It involves, in our opinion, either of  two alternatives :        (1). The coercion of Ulster, which is unthinkable.       (2). The partition of Ireland, which would be disastrous.    We have more than once put forward a Federal Scheme based on the Swissor Canadian precedent, which might ensure a  united Ireland  with  provincialautonomy for Ulster, or any other Province that desired it.    This scheme would also be capable of being adapted to some larger scheme ofImperial Federation for the whole British Empire.                               J. P.

                            REPORTBY  THE  UNDERSIGNED   NATIONALISTS.     1. The object set before the Convention was to frame a Constitution for Irelandwithin the Empire.    This was the first time the Government had assigned such acommission to a body of Irishmen; and we approached  the task with.a deep senseof the gravity of the circumstances in which  the idea of the Convention originatedas well as of the responsibility which rested  upon us of giving the best answer inour power to a reference of such supreme importance.     2. Though its function was to draft a Constitution, the Convention was not aConstituent Assembly with a direct mandate from the people to plan the form of-Government under which they desired to live.  Still it might well claim a considerablemeasure of authority for its proceedings.  Except for some important political andlabour abstentions it has worthily reflected almost every phase and.interest and classin the varied life of Ireland.  But there has been  no sure means of knowing howfar it exhibited the mind and will of Ireland at the present time, even as regardsthe parties officially represented  in it, nor any guarantee that its decisions, inde-pendently of suggestions made by the Government, would take effect in law.  TheSinn Fein organisation stood altogether aloof.     3. Nevertheless, whatever the  difficulties might be, we determined to make themost of the unique opportunity  that presented itself when Irishmen of opposingparties were for the first time  to come together  in a  large body to discuss infriendship the  future government  of their country at a great crisis in the worldshistory.    To  co-operate  in devising  a  scheme  of  National  self-governmentwhich would satisfy the  reasonable aspirations of our,  fellow-countrymen,  andprovide adequate safeguards for minorities, was altogether according to our desires.We believed that if a  measure  giving us  full control over our own affairs was^agreed to, and given  effect  to  by the Government, the  vast majority of IrishNationalists  would accept it and  bend their minds to  making it a  success,  andthat the good will  to the Constitution  which had followed self-government in theDominions would speedily spring  up here.     4. Such hopes  as were entertained  of success in building a worthy edifice fromthese foundations were strengthened by the preliminary debates of the Convention,which were upon a high level, and showed  a real desire for mutual enlightenment-and understanding.  It looked  as if the gravity  of the times, the principles offreedom for which  the Allied Nations claimed to stand, the widespread desire for a:&apos;settlement throughout the Dominions  and among&apos; our  American&apos;kindred,  andthe disastrous  consequences  of further conflict and disunion,  might bring&apos; about aspontaneous resolve among all the assembled delegates to establish. our country asa free and contented nation within the Empire. &apos;      ^   -            [&apos;  t?&apos;; &apos;5: These expectations have been only iii part; realised;   The Southern (Unionist^delegates,- abandoning; a long tradition of opposition to Home Rule, came forward frankly and fairly&apos; to: assist&apos; in planning&apos; a&apos; scheme of- self-government.   We readily
acknowledge the  patriotism of their action, and we can only regret  deeply  thaton one point, the  control of Customs, which we regarded as vital, they could not see.cye to eye with us, and thus effect a complete mutual agreement on a Constitution.     6. The Labour delegates also took a very useful part in the deliberations.   As abody the)7&apos; were strongly in favour of a measure of self-government for Ireland.     7. On the other hand, the Ulster Unionists, who were in close touch with their-supporters in the North,  to our  great regret did not see their way to give muchco-operation in  constructive  work along  the lines which the  Convention wasfollowing.   The  objections which they  formulated to our  proposals  would,  ifgiven effect to, reduce the Irish  Parliament to a low level at the outset.  Whattheir view might be in an Irish  Parliament is a different matter.  Every one ofthe Dominions contained  a minority of citizens accustomed to identify themselveswith Imperial interests who predicted a calamity for their country and the wholeEmpire if self-government were fully conceded.   We are confident that the experi-ence of the  Convention will tend to remove any such feeling in Ulster; and, in orderto make it  easy  for our esteemed fellow-countrymen to join on fair terms in oneParliament for  the whole country, we went so far as to concede them a largemeasure of  additional elected representation in the Irish House of  Commons.   Theywould be a powerful and effective element in an  Irish Parliament,     8. We realised clearly from  the outset that to obtain an agreement upon HomeRule for a United Ireland, and thus fulfil the purpose of the Convention, compromisewas necessary,   But  we also  realised  that to carry compromise to the point ofagreeing to a scheme which,  in  our  judgment, Ireland  would not accept from uswould  be  very  unwise,  apart  from  our own decided  opinions on  the  rightsolution of the Irish problem.  The truth is, that it is in the control by Irishmenof the machinery of Irish Government  rather than in a  reduction of the powers ofthe  Irish Parliament that the best field is to be found for a reasonable compromise. This brings us to the recommendations of our Report.     9. The terms of reference given to. the Convention contained the single limitationthat the Constitution must be within the Empire.      10.  Within  the  Empire  and peculiar  to it, there is  a form of Constitution, enjoyed by all the self-governing Dominions, which has brought peace, contentment and prosperity, to those nations,  together with an attachment.to the Empire which has  grown steadily  firmer, even after rebellion and open war.   This form of Constitution  rests on three main  principles (1) the Imperial Parliament  retains full control over all  Imperial affairs, foreign relations, the making of peace and war, the Army and Navy.  (2) The Dominion Parliament is technically a subordinate-one,  whose Bills must receive the  Royal  Assent to  become valid, and whose Acts may legally be  over-ridden by  the  Imperial Parliament.   (3)  Subject to  these limitations, the  Dominion has unfettered  power of national  self-government,  in- cluding full control of all taxation.      11. Ireland is a  Nation, and it is upon a like  foundation that we believe the Irish Constitution should now be  built.  There is. room for. compromise on details, and -even on secondary questions of principle, and there is abundant room for compromise of the wisest kind in the  form of safeguards for the minorities inside Ireland, without limiting the  powers  of  Ireland as a whole.  But we  think it essential to abide by the principle that Irish affairs,  including all branches of taxation, should be under the Irish Parliament,      12. It has often been.said in our  debates,.and outside them, that it would be unsafe for Great Britain to permit an island so near her to have political-power resenibling in any degree.that, of the  Dominions,  As regards national defence, we have allowed a difference:  to ;exist- and in the matter of trade there is, room for ii special arrangement.   But, as to the rest, we can only reply that reconciliation between the two countries is made exceedingly difficult unless it can be shown that-The/British ,pegple sincerely - believe in liberty for. its  own sake,, and are willing. to&apos; apply to  I r el arid  the princij)le that,  the  supposed, military, interests of  great
states shall not over-ride  the rights of small nationalities living  alongside them.The noble principle of liberty, which has had such a&quot; unifying- effect in the Dominionsduring the,war now devastating Europe surely cannot:lose its virtue when appliedto an. island near to . Great  Britain, where  mutual  interests and intimate com-mercial.relations ought  to promise an*even closer friendship, f    13. While we think,  therefore, that any settlement founded on distrust of Irelandwill fail in its effect, and that the nearer the Irish Constitution approaches tothat of the Dominions, the better will be its prospects, we have striven with earnestsincerity to meet the opposition of Unionist minorities in Ireland, and allay theirfears; with safeguards which do not infringe any vital principle.   We take in turnthe points  where difference has arisen, and the proposals  which we make for corn-promise.    14.  Customs and Excise.  The principal point of difference arose on finance.We asked for full powers of taxation.  The Ulster representatives wished to reserveall powers of taxation to  the Imperial Parliament,  and only modified this demandto the extent of allowing  to the Irish Parliament some undefined  taxing power ofits own.  The Southern Unionists were prepared to concede direct taxation andExcise to the Irish Parliament, and admitted the reasonableness of Ireland&apos;s claimto separate Customs treatment by proposing an arrangement which, in effect, would place  a moral  obligation  upon  the  Imperial  Parliament of  imposing  lower,Customs. duties  in Ireland than in Great Britain  upon articles of general con-sumption.  They could  not see their way to go further and allow the Irish Parlia-ment control over Customs.   Ultimately they acquiesced in a proposition from theGovernment that leaves the control  of Customs and  Excise to the decision of theImperial Parliament after the war.  In  an Irish Parliament  we have no  doubtthat many of them would claim the fiscal  autonomy which more than  one&apos;of themadvocated in the earlier stages of the  Convention.     15.  The taxing power so deeply affects the welfare and prosperity of the people,the dignity of Parliament, and the wise and economical administration  of the Government,  that no part of  it could be placed under  external control  withoutperpetuating friction  with  Great Britain and  discontent in  Ireland.   Thecontrol  of  indirect taxation, which  determines the  course of  trade and  in normaltimes produced  seventy per cent,  of Irish tax-revenue, is of especial importance.Irish Government cannot be financed without drawing largely on these  sources  ofrevenue, nor  can an equitable balance between direct  and  indirect  taxation  beobtained if two  authorities instead of one are controlling them.   Moreover, theindirect taxes affect articles  of  general consumption  among the  mass Of thepopulation, including necessaries of life.     16.  Economically, Ireland is, and always has been, different from Great Britain&quot;. It is a  much poorer country, and a country with few manufacturing industries. It has suffered  severely from over-taxation  under  the Union, and urgently needs a separate fiscal system  under Irish  control.   There is not an instance in the world  of an island  differing so radically from a  powerful neighbouring country being united with it under a common fiscal system.     17. No exception can be made in the case of Customs, which, under the present free trade system, comprise the duties on such important articles as sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco.:  Moreover fiscal systems everywhere are in the melting pot, and there is a likelihood of radical change in the British system.    No change could possibly affect Ireland and Great Britain in the same way. and we consider it neces- sary that Ireland; should have the  right of  guarding her own trade interests and controlling her-own trade policy.   It may be said with truth that the power of each state within the Empire to control the whole of its own taxation, and especially its Customs, is the ver)&apos; corner-stone of Imperial unity.    . ,18. Federation is&apos; not in view.   Even if it were, and Ireland were still intent on retaining control of her Customs, her sea  boundary and  her  distinct national character and economic interests  would give her a claim in that  respect which  no member of a federation anywhere else can advance.
     19.  it has been said that to give the Irish Government the power of negotiatingcommercial&apos;arrangements with foreign countries will complicate foreign relations &apos;and place her in&apos;an unwarrantably privileged position.   We answer that no such&apos;complications arise in the case of the Dominions, and&apos; that what, we ask for implies,in our own case as in theirs, no  diminution of Imperial authority.   Any suchtrade arrangement has to be negotiated through the agency of the  Colonial Office,as representing the Imperial Government, in which the treaty-making power aloneresides.&apos;     20. Another objection was the inconvenience to trade if a Customs barrier wereset up and ships were searched for  dutiable articles. &apos; But the system was in forcehere until the middle of the last century.   It still prevails in trade, not only withAmerica,  France,  and foreign countries generally,  but  with the Dominions, theCrown Colonies, and even the Channel Islands.   It  is, moreover, the onlv effectivemeans of ascertaining what the  true income of Ireland amounts to.  The revenueat present attributed  to Ireland in respect  of tea and other dutiable commoditiesis official guesswork, founded mainly on the numbers of the population.     21. But  the strongest objection made to the control of Customs, an objectionurged principally  by the Ulster Unionists, was that it might interrupt free tradebetween  Ireland and Great Britain.  Thev stated that the raw materials of Ulsterindustiw were drawn mainly from Great Britain, which was also the market for muchof their finished  produce,  and that close  commercial intercourse  was thereforeessential.  But this is true also of Irish agriculture, for whose  products, which areperishable, and are exported in normal times to a greater value than the products ofall the Ulster industries combined, Great Britain is at the present time the best andpractically the only market.   It would  be  folly to  offend our best customer.     22.  As both countries are so deeply interested  in free  access to one another&apos;smarkets, we believe that  mutual advantage would be a surer  guarantee of free andfriendly  intercourse than any legal restrictions.   But, in order to meet Unionistfears, we are ready to agree to provisions  in the Constitutional Act maintainingfree trade between the two countries in articles of home produce,  subject to safe-guards against dumping, for a reasonable term of years, and thereafter by mutualagreement.   This  would ensure that  if any change became absolutely necessary,owing either to.an altered tariff policy in  Great  Britain, or to any other reason,it could not be made  without prolonged deliberation in the Irish Parliament.     23.  We  desire to recall  the fact that in proposing full  powers of taxation forIreland we are not making a new or unsupported claim.  The three most eminentfinancial authorities  upon  the  Financial  Relations Commission  of 1895   LordFarrer,  Lord Welby, and Mr.  Bertram Currie reported in a powerful  reasonedargument, while disclaiming all political  prepossessions, that  this was the  onlysound method of   solving the question.   The  frimrose Committee  of  financialexperts,  no longer ago than  1911, unanimously and with equal emphasis reportedto the same effect, recommending the Irish control of  Customs with arrangementsfor free  trade between the two countries.   None of the  arguments used by thesehigh authorities, after exhaustive  investigation,  have  lost their weight, and somehave gained  strength.     24.  The Act  of 1914, which gives Ireland some restricted powers in regard toCustoms, contains in  Section 26 a distinct guarantee that when Irish revenue hadmet Irish expenditure for three successive  years, the financial arrangements wouldbe revised for the  express purpose of increasing the powers of the Irish Parliamentover  taxation, as well as for settling an Imperial contribution.  The condition isnow fulfilled.  A  large balance of  revenue over expenditure has been growing forthree years,  and it can  no longer  be  said  that an  estimated  deficit justifies anycurtailment of Irish control over Irish finance.        - t-     25.  We  fully agree  that there should be some regular machineryfor.,ensuringclose co-operatioir betweenGreat Britain  and  Ireland in commercial and postalmatters; and we,  therefore,  propose  the establishment of.a  Joint  Advisory Corn-mission  with power to make agreements and recommendations on these important matters.
   ,  26. The, Imperial Contribution.  A most important financial question is the-nature and amount of the contribution to be made by Ireland to Imperial services.The  obligation of Ireland to contribute according to her means we accept withoutquestion.  As to the method, our view is that this, is another case where the greatestwisdom would lie in following the  Dominion  precedent that is,  in making the-matter one of voluntary negotiation  between the  Irish and Imperial Governments.the contribution taking the form of payment for services of an  Imperial nature,as by the maintenance of forces for local defence or the provision of ships.  Ireland..on her side, would renounce all claim to subsidies or payments of any kind fromthe British  Exchequer.   This would make a  clean  financial  settlement.   GreatBritain would not be exacting what many might regard as tribute.  Ireland wouldwipe out bitter memories of  over-taxation and  neglect,  and  face the  future notonly as a self-reliant country, but as  a more willing because a more free contributorto the common defence.   It must be recognised  that if  this  plan is not adoptedand  a statutory contribution  is to be enforced by law, there is  no logical coursebut to re-open intricate questions of taxable capacity, which will inevitably bringinto prominence the over-taxation of Ireland in the past, and will be held to justifyclaims for compensation.     27.  In  view of strong  Unionist feeling, however, we do not press our viewsupon the point,  and are willing to agree to a statutory payment, to be fixedprovisionally at  the outset and afterwards by  agreement between the  Imperialand Irish Governments.    We only stipulate  that the annual expenses of LandPurchase, which must be regarded  as  an Imperial obligation,  though  an Irishservice, as well as the cost of any defence forces that may  be raised and maintainedin the future by the Irish  Government, shall  be set off against  the sum so fixed.The same applies,  in a large measure, to the Housing scheme.   The balance couldbest be paid in kind by the provision of ships or other war material manufacturedin Ireland.     28.  Local Forces.  Any settlement which  prohibited Ireland, as a matter ofprinciple, from providing military forces  for her. own local defence in the consti- tutional manner customary in the Dominions would, in our opinion, be unacceptable.The confidence shown by entrusting her with such a power would, we are convinced, be repaid a thousandfold.  But here, again, we  have felt it our duty to give wayto cautious views,  and we propose that the power should remain  in abeyance forfive  years, and should then depend on the consent of the Imperial Conference, uponwhich Ireland should be duly represented.     29. As regards the question of conscription, we are ready to take it for grantedthat no  attempt  would be made to apply it to Ireland without the consent of the Irish Parliament,   Any attempt to impose conscription upon a nation without  its- sanction is utterly impolitic and unjust, and is bound to  end in disaster.     30. Representation at Westminster..  We preferred that this representa- tion should cease until such time as a Parliament is created in which all parts of the Empire or  the Realm  could  be properly  and  equitably  represented.   Until that time we believe that every purpose  served  by representation could be better served by  arrangements  for regular and  systematic conference between the  Irish and British  Governments in a  permanent consultative council.  By sending members to the British Parliament  at Westminster, after  we have obtained a  Parliament of our own,  we risk  incurring the odium of disturbing the balance  of English parties  and  influencing  questions  on  which we are not concerned, without any securit)^ that in matters where Ireland is properly concerned  her voice will carry its due weight, since in order to avoid too much dislocation it is necessaiy to reduce her membership far below  the number to  which  her population entitles her.  But in view of the great importance attached by Unionists to-this representation,  we were reluctant to maintain our opposition, and we accordingly agreed to a delegation of 42 Irish members being sent to Westminster by the. Irish Parliament,  That is the form of representation at Westminster that will least distract Irish attention from&quot; the necessary concentration at home, and least divide the views of our members in London from those  of the Irish  Parliament.
                                       41                                      (\k    31. SAFEGUARDS FOR MINORITIES.  All the points we have hitherto dealt withareiconcerned with the&quot; future1 constitutional&apos;^                           threatBritain, and the powers&apos; to be  exercised&quot;by the: Irish&apos;--Parliament.&apos;/1 In- regard fo:safeguards!for minorities in Ireland against any misuse of these1 powers that &apos;they &apos;;might  fear,  we have gone to extreme lengths in&apos; our anxiety to reach&apos; a  settlement.    32. That political parties wil] long continue on existing lines seems most unlikely.;But we have agreed that an Irish House of Commons at the outset shall have,aUnionist strength of 40 per cent. and. that the Upper House shall  consist of noml-nated  and exojficio members,  of  peers elected by their own order, and of other;members elected by their own class.  The two ,Houses  would sit and. vote togetheron questions in  dispute between them, including Money Bills.  -   33. These arrangements are  intended  to give to  commercial: and industrialinterests,  and to Unionist views generally, a powerful voice  in the  final decision  ofall legislative questions, including  financial measures.     34. We are aware that in agreeing to these arrangements we put a severe strainon the Irish democracy, and hazard the adverse opinion of the outside world.   Butwe take the risk on condition that full powers of self-government, especially fulleconomic  and financial powers, are  entrusted to the  Parliament so  constituted.We believe  the guarantee offered against the wrongful- and imprudent exercise  ofthese  powers to be  needless.  But, provided that Irish questions are  left to thedecision-of  the  Irish Parliament,  we trust our countrymen of North,  South, Eastand West to act loyally and patriotically in the interests of Ireland.     35. The nomination of some Members to the Lower  House appears to be the onlysure and  practicable way  of providing adequate minority  representation  for the:Southern  Unionists.    In the  case of the Ulster Unionists,  who prefer election, we should be willing to agree to securing larger representation for them by arranging for  smaller electoral quotas or for any electoral expedient  which  would effect thedesired result.  As  regards the Ulster  difficulty, we know of no other plan whichwould  not  impair  the efficiency of Parliament and keep  in  being religiousantagonisms which  all good Irishmen desire to see ended.     36. Civil Service Commissions.   We propose the establishment of fairly constituted Civil Service  Commissions to regulate competitive examinations and advise on all patronage and appointments.     37. Temporary Arrangements during the War.    So far from thinkingthat the war should further delay the establishment of an Irish Executive and Parlia- ment,  we regard a postponement of these measures as  a disaster and their prompt passage into law an advantage which no administrative difficulties should be allowed to thwart.  We  recognise, however, that the abnormal conditions brought iabout  by the  war make it difficult to carry out some of the changes required.   We do not think  these difficulties ought to be  magnified.  The advantage gained by proofs-ofasincere desire to let the Irish people manage their owrn affairs will far outweighdisturbance of official routine.  But, if it  is clearly laid down that any reserved oower will  be operative immediately after the war, a certain  amount of-postpone-&quot; ment  is admissible.  What we altogether object to is the  postponement of vital questions until  after the war.   Now is the time to decide them- in principle. This makes it impossible for us to agree to any suggestions made by the  Government during pur deliberations to leave the. futpre of, Customs and Excise  in complete uncertainty. t[&apos; J^fl[ ^             ,&apos;Kvi -.-. . ., i . ;. - r -- &apos;i- - -.i       -       &apos;     3&amp;;NO&apos;doubt it might be difficult to transfer the  control of these  two  services during;jthe war,;and we:therefore consent  to their temporary maintenance.under Imperial authority:  But a&apos; Joint  Board &quot;should be immediately set,up to determine the-time revenue of Ireland from  these taxes, and to allocate their ^proceeds,., -as - so. determined^ to the Irish -Exchequer;  :.  &apos;  &apos;;  \- 1&apos;   &apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;;: V  &quot;&apos;]&apos; .&apos;:  ,  ..,   i-: (,                                                                       F
     39. We do not like to contemplate even a temporary reservation of the Police orTost Office.  But, to meet the views of others, we have  agreed that  the Imperialand Irish Governments may jointly arrange for the unified control of either serviceduring the war.     40. Land Purchase.-  It is an important part of any scheme for the settlementof  the Irish  question that Land  Purchase should be completed on terms equitablealike to landlord and tenant; that the administration should be Irish, and that thefull cost of Land Purchase, past and future, should be borne by the Irish Govern-ment, on the understanding that  it be reckoned as part of Irelands contribution toImperial services.   Happily,  no serious  difference of opinion  has arisen  in  theConvention on the proposals framed by the able Committee which dealt with LandPurchase, and we recommend that a measure embodying  the scheme outlined in itsHeport shall be annexed to the Constitutional Act.                                 SUMMARY.     41. To sum up, we propose a Constitution conferring powers on Ireland whichare strictly consistent  with Imperial unity  and strictly conform  to the limits  setby the reference to the Convention.     42. We propose an Irish Parliament with full powers of legislation in all Irishaffairs,  subject to the  religious  safeguards  contained in Section  3 of the Act of 1914 (the existing disabilities to be  removed in  the Constitutional Act), and with full  powers of taxation,  but with no power to  make laws on Imperial concerns; the Crown, foreign relations, peace and war, the Army and Navy and other allied matters duly  specified.     43. At the same time, we do our utmost to meet the doubts and  objections of Unionists by  agreeing to the following provisions :      (1)  Generous additional representation in the Irish Parliament.     (2)  A guarantee  for a reasonable period of Fr.ee Trade between Ireland and           Great Britain  in articles which are the produce  or manufacture of           either country.     (3)  A Joint Advisory Commission  to  secure co-operation in commercial and           postal matters.     (4)  Continued representation in the Imperial Parliament in such a way as           to reflect the views of the different parties in the Irish Parliament,     (5)  A fixed statutory contribution to Imperial expenses.     (6)  Independent Civil Service  Commissions.     (7)  Suspension for a term of years of the power to raise local defence forces.     (8)  Suspension till  the end of the war  of the powers over Customs and Excise,            with an arrangement to  be made by joint agreement for the control of            Police and Post Office by the two Governments for a like period. We also agree to the  scheme adopted by the Convention for the speedy completion of Land. Purchase, and  express our  concurrence in the Housing scheme.
                              CONCLUSION.         &quot;&apos;^     --7.&apos;    44. Such a Constitution would, we believe, meet with the approval of the greatmajority of the people of Ireland.  It would be accepted by our kindred in theUnited States and  Colonies.  It is generous to the Irish Unionists, and good forGreat Britain as well as for Ireland.   Had  it been put into  operation at thebeginning of the war, the World&apos;s history  might have been very  different in these-deciding years.  Better late than never.                  %tj.  M.

NOTE   BY    THE   MAJORITY   OF   THE                      NATIONALISTS.     1. In order to reach an agreement  between Unionists and Nationalists, we donot at this moment desire to press our objection to the fiscal proposals contained inthe Prime  Minister&apos;s letter, as we hold it to be of paramount importance that anIrish Parliament  with an  Executive responsible thereto should  be immediatelyestablished, and that, concurrently with the  legislation necessary  to  effect  thatobject, measures should be passed by the Imperial Parliament to provide for theentire completion of  Land Purchase and the solution of the  Housing Problem.     2. In coming to this decision we are largely moved by the  belief that the Govern-ment we are  helping to establish will be an effective instrument  in obtaining  forIreland by general consent whatever further powers her material interests require ;and that the proposal to  pay into the Irish Exchequer the full proceeds of Irishtaxation, direct and indirect, subject only to  an agreed contribution to Imperialexpenditure, will  give the Irish Government means for internal development,  andwill prevent the ruinous increase  of burdens  which would certainly result if Irelandremained liable to the full weight of Imperial taxation, and jointly responsible forthe Imperial  debt.     3; But since the decision  upon Ireland&apos;s  claim to full fiscal autonomy is  onlypostponed, we, the undersigned, desire to put on record  against the time when thatdecision has to be made, our  conviction that, according to all precedents in theBritish Empire, an Irish Parliament is entitled, and ought to  become the sole taxingauthority for Ireland, unless and  until, in the general interest it sees fit to part withsome portion of its financial independence.   We hold, however, that in the commoninterest of both  countries there should be a Free Trade agreement between GreatBritain and Ireland.     4. We desire to add that we protest most  strongly against the suggestion  thatalternative sittings of the  Irish Parliament might  be held in  some other place thanDublin,  and also against  the proposal  that there should be set up anywhere inIreland other than in Dublin a complete branch of the Irish administration^    *Lord MacDormell  is unable to participate in this paragraph for  the following reasons:  thismatter was never raised or discussed in  the Convention, and without the fullest discussion heabstains from expressing an opinion on it;  Lord MacDonnell is well aware that the proposal wouldgive rise to vehement opposition in Leinster, Munster and Connaught, and probably amongst theNationalist population of Ulster; it would certainly impose many hardships upon the great majorityof  the Irish people;  and would unquestionably  be productive of extreme  administrative  incon-venience.  But so strong is Lord MacDonnelPs desire to meet all reasonable wishes of the Unionistsof Ulster that he feels unable to negative the proposal without having before him the Ulster Unionistviews upon the point.
    5.  We  further hold that, by the Act  constituting an Irish Parliament, powershould be taken to prevent dumping, and we believe that this could most convenientlybe done by prohibiting the export from Great Britain to Ireland, and vice versa,of any  article which is being  sold under the cost of its production.  It should bemade a duty Of the, Joint Exchequer Board to enquire into alleged cases of dumping,and action should originate on a report  from them.                    M. .K.

NOTE   BY   THE   MAJORITY   OF   THE        LABOUR   REPRESENTATIVES.     1- We desire to make it clear that we have supported the agreement which hasbeen brought about in the Convention between Unionists and Nationalists, becausewe believe that self-government is in the best interests of the country,  and that ameasure giving it effect should be passed promptly into law.    2. We recognise that an agreement could not have been brought about withoutcertain temporary concessions made in regard to the Constitution  of  the  IrishParliament which  we, as  democrats and representatives of  Labour, regard  withstrong dislike.   But we feel so deeply the necessity of setting up a Parliament inIreland, hi which Labour amongst other interests, may be able to find a  place, thatwe have been willing to subordinate our democratic beliefs to what we conceiveto be the  highest  interests of Ireland.                                SENATE.    3. As to the constitution of the Senate  we are still totally opposed to the nomi-nated element believing same  should be elected on a democratic vote if Labour isto be given a chance to be represented in that body by its own choice. So stronglydo we feel on this point that  we are prepared to recommend our fellow workmennot to accept nomination to the chamber.    4. As  a compromise we are prepared to agree with  the nominations as out-lined in Head 9, sub-heads (1) to (5).                          HOUSE  OF COMMONS.    5. We are of opinion that the elected members of  the Irish House of  Commons,like the members of the Imperial House of Commons, and of the principal Legislaturesin the British Dominions,  should receive a salary which we suggest should be atthe rate of  400 per annum.                             FRANCHISE.    6. We are of opinion that  the Representation of the People Act, 1918,  shouldcontinue to be the law governing the franchise in Ireland.JAMES  McCARRON.HENRY  T.

              &apos;      NOTE                         BYTHE    EARL   OF   DUNRAVEN.    In signing the Report I desire to say :     I.  I regret that no recommendation is made in favour of a Grand Committeecomposed  of  Ulster representatives in  the  new  Irish Parliament, who would beempowered to supervise legislative and administrative action seriously affecting theinterests of that province.    II. In my opinion Federalism is the best principle upon which to base a Unionthat will give Ireland the fullest measure of self-government,  that will enable thenew Irish  Constitution to fit into complete federation of the United Kingdom whenthe appropriate time comes, and to form a consistent link in the chain that may leadto Constitutional synthesis  within the Empire.    III. I regret, therefore, that the Convention  did not proceed on more definiteFederal lines, but the decisions arrived at are not incompatible with a Federal sj^stem;they mark reconciliation between hitherto antagonistic bodies of public opinion ;they indicate the lines which legislation should follow, and I accept them withoutfurther reservation.DUNRAVEN.
    We think it necessary to add to the Report of the Proceedings of the Conventiona brief statement of our position, because the Resolution introduced by us  onJanuary 2nd, 1918, was, owing to circumstances, not brought to a decision.    1.  We desire to record our unaltered conviction that the Legislative Unionprovides the best system of government for Ireland, but having entered the Con-vention on an appeal from H.M. Government, based on high considerations of Alliedand Imperial interests which it was impossible to disregard, we have  endeavouredto assist the Convention in devising a Constitution which would meet the aspirationsfor self-government within the Empire long held by a great  majority of the Irishpeople.    2.  We believe that an Irish Parliament can only be established with safety toImperial interests and security for the  minority in Ireland, by the participation ofIrishmen of various classes and creeds in the government which is rendered possibleby the safeguards agreed with  practical unanimity by the Convention and forwhich no provision was made under the Act of 1914.    3.  We regard the following points  as vital to any satisfactory settlement, andour action must be subject to  these conditions :       (1).  That  Ireland occupy the same position  as  other parts of the United            Kingdom in  any scheme for the  Federation of the Empire or  the.            United Kingdom.      (2).  That all Imperial questions and services, including the levying of Customs            Duties, be left in the hands of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.      (3). That  Ireland send  representatives to Westminster.      (4). That  the whole of Ireland participate in any Irish Parliament.  *      (5). That the safeguards in the Report agreed to b3^ the Convention be estab-            lished.      (6). That an adequate  contribution be made hy Ireland to Imperial services.    Our lamented colleague, Sir Henry  Blake, expressed by letter in January last hisconcurrence with us  on the above  points.

soAPPENDIX  I.LETTER  PROM   THE   PRIME   MINISTER  TO  MR.   J.   REDMOND                              REGARDING  IRELAND.                           Parliamentary  Paper, 1917,  (Cd. 8573.)Dear Mr. Redmond,    The Government have been considering  forsome time what further action they could take tobring about  a settlement of  the Irish question.They have approached the subject with a deepdesire to put an end to a state of affairs which isproductive of immense  evil not only to Irelandbut  to  Great Britain and the Empire.  Thechoice of alternatives open to them, however, hasbeen narrowed by the fact that it is impossiblefor them, in  the crisis of a war in which our safetyand the liberty of most of the nations of Europeis  at stake,   to take action which would reviveviolent  political  controversy  and so  weaken orimperil the unity which is essential to the supremenecessity of winning the war. They have thereforefelt that any settlement which they could pro-pose during  the war must be one which would besubstantially accepted   by  both  sides. Theywould have wished in  accordance with  thisprinciple to enter upon negotiations with  theIrish representatives, but this, as you know, wasimpossible,  owing to  the decision  of  your partynot to negotiate  with the Government.   The idea of the Government has been to try toeffect an immediate  settlement, conceding  thelargest possible measure of Home Rule which  canbe secured by agreement at this  moment, with-out prejudice to the undertaking by  Parliamentof a further  and final settlement of the questionsmost in dispute, after the war.  They are there-fore prepared to put forward proposals on the  fol-lowing lines, with a view to present  action.   Firstly, they  would introduce a Bill for  theimmediate application of the Home  Rule Act toIreland, but excluding therefrom the six countiesof North-East Ulster, such exclusion to be subjectto reconsideration by Parliament  at the end offive years, unless it is previously  terminated bythe  action of the Council of Ireland,  to be set upas hereinafter described.   Secondly, with  a  view to  securing the largestpossible measure of common action for the wholeof Ireland,  the Bill would provide for a Council of Ireland to be composed of two delegations, con-. sisting,  on  the one  hand, of  all the  members returned to Westminster from the excluded area, and, on the other, of a delegation equal in num-bers from the  Irish Parliament.   This Council could be summoned on  the initiative of any six members.   It would be empowered by a majority of votes of each  of the delegations (a) to pass private Bill legislation affecting both the included and ,the excluded area;  (b) to recommend to the Crown&quot; the  extension to  the  excluded area by               10, Downing Street,                    Whitehall,  S.W. 1,                            mh May, 1917.Order in Council of any Act of the Irish Parlia-ment;  (c) to  agree  to the inclusion  under theHome  Rule Act of the whole of Ireland,  subjectto the  assent of the majority of the voters in theexcluded area, power to be vested in  the Crownin that case to extend the Act to all  Ireland byOrder in Council; (d) to make recommendationson its own initiative upon Irish questions, inclucl-ing the amendment of the&quot;Home  Rule  Act asfinally passed.  The  President of this Council of Ireland wouklbe elected by agreement between the delegations,or in default of agreement he would be nominatedby the Crown.  Thirdly, the Government  consider that thefinancial proposals  of the Home  Rule Act areunsatisfactory  and  ought to  be  reconsidered.There are a number of important objects,  such asthe development of Irish industries, the improve-ment of housing in the towns, and  the furtheranceof  education  (including  a  better  scale  ofremuneration for teachers), which cannot, owingto changed conditions which  have arisen sincethe war, be adequately dealt with under the pro-visions of that Act  without imposing an undueburden on the Irish taxpayer.  Fourthly, the Government would recommendthat,  after second  reading,  the Bill  embodyingthe above proposals, together with  the Home BuleAct, should be  forthwith  considered by a confer-ence  to  be  constituted  on  the  lines  of theSpeakers  Conference  on   Electoral  Reform,though not consisting exclusively of Members ofParliament, and meeting  under the chairmanshipof someone commanding  the same general  con-fidence in his impartiality and judgment as Mr.Speaker  himself.    The  conference  would, ofcourse, have full power to suggest any.alterationsin the Government scheme irpon  which it mightdecide.   The Government feel that a proposal which pro-vides for immediate Home Rule  for  the greaterpart of Ireland, while excluding that part of Ire-land which objects  to coming under the HomeRule Act, for a definite period after  which Par-liament will consider the matter afresh ; which re-cognises the profound sentiment  existing  in Ire-land for the unity  of the country by creating acommon  council  to  consider  Irish affairs as awhole; which,  finally, sets  up a representativeConference to attempt to adjust the most difficultquestions involved, is as far as they can possiblygo towards effecting a legislative settlement inthe crisis of a great war.
  They are prepared to introduce a Bill on theselines.  But they feel that it would be idle, and Iam sure you will agree with them,  to introducesuch a  Bill  unless it were assured of somethinglike a second reading acceptance from both Irish.&quot;&quot;&apos;parties.  I sincerely hope  that if the Governmentintroduce this Bill the party of which you are thehead will give this  measure of support  to pro-posals which will give immediate&apos; self-government .in Ireland to those who wish for it, and will atthe same time create and keep continuously inbeing the means whereby a final  reconciliationbetween the two sections  of the Irish people canat any time  be brought about.  We earnestly recommend the proposals which Ihave outlined  above to  the dispassionate con-sideration of men of all  parties.  If upon suchconsideration a basis for immediate  action  isfound in them we shall proceed at once with thenecessaiy steps to carry them  into  effect.  If this  should not  be the  case  there  remainsan alternative  plan  which,  though  it has  beensometimes seriously  discussed, has never  beenauthoritatively  proposed:  that  of assembling  aConvention of Irishmen of all parties for the pur-pose of producing a scheme  of Irish  self-govern-ment.  As  you will remember the constitution of theUnion of South  Africa was framed, despite mostformidable difficulties  and obstacles, by a  Con-vention representative  of all the interests  andparties in the country,  and the Government be-lieves that a similar expedient might, in the lastresort, be found effectual in Ireland.  Would  itbe too much to  hope that Irishmen of all creedsand parties might meet together in a  Conventionfor the purpose of drafting a Constitution for theircountry which should secure  a just balance of allthe opposing interests  and finally compose theunhappy discords which have so long distractedIreland and impeded  its harmonious  develop-ment&apos;?  The Government is  ready, in default ofthe adoption of their present proposals for HomeRule, to take the -necessary steps   for the as-sembling of such a Convention.  I should be much obliged  if you found it pos-sible to give me  your views on this letter in orderto allow the  Government to  consider the matterbefore Monday.                 Yours sincerely,                    D.  LLOYD GEOBGE,G&quot;2

                     APPENDIX  IHLetter from Chairman to the.Members of the Convention.                                              Kilteragh,                                                  Foxrock,                                                      Co.  Dublin,                                                          17th August,  1917.My Lords and Gentlemen,  On Tuesday next,  the  necessary  preparationshaving  been  made,  we  shall  enter  upon  thedefinite task entrusted to us, the search for a pos-sible basis of agreement between the differentsections  of our  countrymen  upon the  futuregovernment of our countrv.  The historic importance  of the occasion, and myown special responsibility in regard to it, move meto send you in advance some thoughts upon cer-tain aspects of the work before us.   I desire moreparticularly to  explain  the procedure  for  ourcoming  deliberations, which you  approved  inprinciple at the Session of August 8-9,  as it hassince been elaborated by your Grand Committee.I do so because the plan  adopted is as unprece-dented as the situation for which it was  devised.  Those who  tell us that  our best meant  en-deavours  must come  to naught  have  amplegrounds  for  their  pessimism  in  the  history ofsimilar efforts. They see us confronted with a taskwhich has baffled generation after generation ofthe British people called upon to overcome thedifficulties notoriously incidental to the work offraming  a constitution.   We have to  resolvethese difficulties in a time of grave domestic un-rest, in an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion,and in the midst  of  the greatest  war  in  humanhistory!   It is true that this is the first attemptto get the Irish question  settled by Irishmen inIreland.   But, even  so, no man of sense wouldexpect it to succeed unless inside the Conventionseme wholly new spirit were  to  prevail.   Myhopes rest upon the fact that already this neces-sary condition has been supplied.    For the firsttime, an opportunity has  been afforded to revealthe whole of the Irish mind, and the whole of theIrish heart, not to the foreigner whom we haveto impress and perhaps are  sometimes temptedto fool but to each other as man to man, with thecommon  aim  of  the welfare of  our  commoncountry.  It must be admitted, however, that the best willin the world will not avail unless the right way befound.  After searching the precedents of analo-gous conventions  and conferences,  a great dealmay be learned; but the final conclusion must bethat no analogy is perfect, and that a wholly newmethod of approach to the great difficulties of ourtask must be  discovered.   This much has, I be-lieve, been accomplished.  In devising the  procedure  best calculated tosecure ordered, harmonious, relevant, and there-fore fruitful, discussion in the Convention  we hadto take into account the circumstances of its mem-bers&apos; lives.  We have most of us some  acquaint-ance with public affairs, but very  few of us havemade a close study of political science and insti-tutions.    In order,  therefore, to take a usefulpart in the coming deliberations we shall nearlyall of us need a certain minimum  of preparation.   We must, of course, have  a general knowledge of the main factors in our political problem and of the various solutions which  are  known to be seriously proposed.  We ought, also, to be fairly familiar with the manner  in which similar prob- leins have been solved in other parts of the world, more particularly in the Dominions of the Com- monwealth to which we belong.  This knowledge is being supplied to us from the Secretariat and will continue to be supplied as the occasion de- mands.   Furthermore,  any  members   wishing either to present proposals of their own, or to dis- cuss proposals put forward by others, can obtain technical assistance from members of the staff and be  supplied  with  books  from  the Reference Library.   So much for  the assistance  outside the  Con- vention.   I  now come to the  procedure inside. Before the plan which I shall presently describe was&apos; adopted,  two other methods were considered. The first was a general discussion upon the exist- ing system of government and the best method of improving  it, everybody being allowed to dis- course at large upon the whole or any part of this enormous subject.  This plan was rejected on the ground  that &quot; lean  and profitless debate &quot; might weary and disgust  business men,  that  it might lead to  angry controversy upon some issue in- opportunely raised,  or that it might &quot; peter out &quot; and leave us still to decide how to get seriously to work.   The second plan, to which  the best pre- cedents  seemed to point, was  a  discussion upon a series of resolutions raising the main questions of principle  as to wdiich agreement must be reached before it is any use trying to construct a new  constitution.   This,  also, looked too like a blind alley.   It  would pass  the wit of  man to frame the resolutions without raising  at   once issues upon wdiich we have in  the  past been in violent  disagreement.    The  path  of   wisdom seemed  to be to explore  first the regions where we know men have been trying to find  common ground.    The  procedure  adopted is that  which,  after giving the matter the best thought of which I was capable, I recommended  to  the  Convention at their last Session.   On Tuesday next we  com- menee  what  for convenience  we  may  call the &quot; Presentation Stage.&quot;  In this, all proposals for the future government of Ireland  will be  sub- mitted to the  Convention in such form and in  such order as the  Grand Committee, through which they will have passed, direct.  Each plan will be discussed  in turn, the  purpose  of the discussion being, not to  arrive at any final decision as to its adoption  or  rejection, but merely to  have  it thoroughly explained and to have it improved by such amendment as its supporters may think  well to adopt in view of the arguments they have heard. It is intended that the Presentation Stage should be continued until the  Convention feels that it has before it all the proposals  which have any likeli-; hood of being adopted, either wholly or in  part. This method  can only succeed  if it obtains the                                      H
general support of the Convention.  The purposein view is, as has been, I trust, made clear above,to enable the  different  sections of Irishmen inthe  Convention to know  clearly,  as  they  havenever known before,  what it is  in our  presentsystem of government that is complained of andexactly what changes the  different sections de-mand.  Further, many of us who have indulgedpolitical hopes have had no expectation of  theirearly realization.  Consequently,  we have neverpresented them in sufficient detail to enable afinal judgment to be come to upon their merits.It is hoped that the members of the Convention&quot;will  do their best, by constructive criticism, to getevery proposal in turn presented in the best pos-sible form.   The debate should be argumentativeand conversational rather than declamatory andimpassioned.   No man should hesitate to expresshis views because he has difficulty at first in find-ing  the phraseology which  is familiar to  few be-sides Members of Parliament and  lawyers.   Ispeak feelingly when I say that the utmost indulg-ence must be extended to bad speakers.   At the meeting of the Grand Committee on the14th instant, it was  agreed that, after the  Pre-sentation Stage, the Convention should be asked&quot;to decide upon the future procedure.  It was sug-gested that  it might instruct the  Grand  Com-mittee, or a Committee  ad hoc,  to draft a Billwhich, in view of the opinions expressed upon thevarious proposals  which had been submitted forpreliminary examination, might possibly form thebasis  of an agreed measure.   The draft wouldthen be re-submitted to the Convention, where itwould go through the usual stages of a Bill in theHouse of Commons.  It may be too much to hopethat complete agreement will be come to withinthe four corners of a single Bill, but I should begrievously disappointed if we did not find ourselvesin a position to announce to the world that wewere not nearly so far apart in our political viewsand desires as had been formerly believed.  In concluding this letter already,  I fear, toolong I cannot refrain from adding a few sentencesfrom the speech of Sir  Henry de Villiers on the12th October,  1908,  before the South  AfricanNational Convention, which had just unanimouslyelected him to preside  over its deliberations:     &quot; The difficulties,&quot;  he said, &quot; which we  shall  have to encounter are great enough without our  going out of our way in order to add to them,  but I feel confident that they will not prove to  be insurmountable.  Everything depends upon  the spirit with which we approach the perform-  ance of our task.   Failure is certain if we  start  with a feeling of distrust and suspicion of  each  - other and with the sole desire to secure as many  advantages as  we   can  for  our  respective  political parties  or  our respective Colonies.  Success is certain if we  give  each other our  fullest confidence  and act upon  the principle  that, while not neglectful of the interests of  those who have sent us here, we are, for the  time  being,  representatives  of the whole of  British South Africa.&quot;  He was an optimist  crying in a  wilderness ofpessimists.   We know who was right and who wasI am,My Lords and Gentlemen,          Very faithfully yours,             HORACE PLUXKETT.
APPENDIX  IV.INTERIM AND  FINALREPORTS,  TO  THE  GRAND  COMMITTEE,  OF THE SUB-       COMMITTEE OF NINE.          .   (I.C. No. 22.)Note.  By the Resolution passed at Cork on Septern-ber &quot;25th  the  Convention  referred the variousschemes which had been submitted to and dis-cussed in  the Convention  to  the Grand Com-mittee, in order  if possible to prepare a schemefor submission to the Convention, which  mightmeet the views and difficulties expressed by thedifferent  speakers  during   the  course of  thedebate.  At its meeting  on October  11th  the  GrandCommittee  appointed  a  Sub-Committee, withinstructions to sit  in  private to  endeavour tofind  a basis for agreement,  and to report  to theGrand Committee from time to time.    The fol-lowing members  constituted  the  Sub-Commit-tee: Mr. Barrie; Mr. Devlin; The Marquis ofLondonderry;   Sir   A.   McDowell;   ViscountMidleton; Mr. William M. Murphy; the Bishopof Raphoe;  Mr. Redmond, and Mr. Russell.  It was further resolved that  the  Sub-Com-lnittee appoint a Chairman from  time to  timeas they may think it necessary, and that shouldthey require secretarial  assistance they shouldhave the services of Sir  Francis Hopwood.  The  Reports attached  hereto are the Reportsmade by this Sub-Committee to the Grand Com-mittee of the Convention, and taken into  con-sideration bv  the Grand  Committee.Interim Report of the  Sub-Committee  to the Grand&apos; Committee of  the Irish Coxvextiox.  The  Sub-Committee appointed by the GrandCommittee at their  meeting on October 11th,with instructions to  sit in private to  endeavourto find a basis for agreement, have the honourto submit the following Interim Report:    We held our first meeting in Dublin on October11th.    We  subsequently  met  in London  onOctober 24th  and 25th, and in Dublin on October30th and 31st, November 1st,  5th, 6th, 7th, 13th,14th and 15th.  Owing to his serious illness, which we greatlyregret, we were deprived of  the services of SirAlexander McDowell after  the   first  meeting.By the unanimous  agreement of the  Sub-Com-mittee his place was taken by Mr.  Pollock,  andthis was subsequently approved by the GrandCommittee.  We decided to take the heads of the  schemesubmitted by the Bishop of Raphoe  to  the GrandCommittee on October 11th  as the basis of ourdeliberations.  A copy of this document is at-tached (Schedule I.).  By  November  7th we had arrived  at certainprovisional conclusions upon  most of  the headsof the scheme.   These conclusions are  set  outin  Schedule   II.,  which  also   indicates   thepoints which  were reserved for further considera-tion.  At this stage  it was considered desirablethat the Ulster representatives should communi-cate with their Advisory Committee with a viewto discovering how far tbj arrangement proposedwith regard to the composition of the two Housesof Parliament was  likely to prove acceptable.Having taken this course, they  intimated to uson November 13th that the Advisory Committeewere unable  to  approve of the  suggestion  thatthe Ulster representation  in  the Lower Houseshould be strengthened by the addition of a num-ber of nominated members.  They considered &apos;that the proposal to include nominated membersto represent  Southern Unionists could  be  de-fended and might be accepted, but the  same con-siderations did not apply.in the  case  of Ulster.The Ulster representatives  undertook  to submitproposals to  us for safeguarding  the interests ofUlster by  means other than the  extra  represen-tation which  we  had contemplated.  By this time,&quot; however, it had become apparent-that there was a sharp divergence of  opinion inthe  Sub-Committee  as to the financial powersto be entrusted to the Irish Parliament.   Thescheme submitted by the  Bishop of Raphoe con-templated   that,  pending  federation   of  theUnited  Kingdom, there should be no Irish repre-sentation in the Imperial Parliament, and pro-vided  for   the  exercise  by  the  Irish  Parlia-ment  of  complete   control over  finance,  in-cluding Customs and Excise,  and suggested theappointment of  a  Commission to  negotiate  aTrade,  Postal,  and  Customs Union  betweenGreat  Britain  and Ireland.  The Ulster repre-sentatives  demurred to these  proposals,  and in-sisted  that full control over finance should beleft  to  the  Imperial Parliament.   Lord  Southborough submitted  to  us certainproposals for effecting  a  compromise by givingto the  Irish Parliament full control, subject toan arrangement for Free Trade  between GreatBritain  and Ireland, and special provisions tomeet the case  of dumping.   A  copy  of  theseproposals is  attached Schedule in.   It was not found possible to reach an agree-ment upon  these  lines,  and  we  appeared tohave no alternative but to  report to the GrandCommittee to that effect.   The Chairman of theConvention  was,  however, anxious  that weshould  not  acquiesce  in the failure to reach anagreement until there had been a closer exami-nation  of the  arguments on the  one  side andthe other.   He embodied  these views, in  a letterin which he enclosed certain questions addressedto  the  Ulster  and Nationalist representativesrespectively, and also a list of possible  compro-mises.   Copies  of this letter and of its enclosuresare attached Schedule IV.  One  set  of replies  was submitted jointly byMr.  Redmond, the  Bishop  of   Raphoe,  Mr.Devlin,  and  Mr. Russell Schedule V.  A   separate  replv  was  submitted  bv  Mr.Murphy-Schedule VI. , These replies  were communicated to the Ulsterrepresentatives, and considered by them.  Theyfelt that in the circumstances the divergence ofviews disclosed  was so great that  no useful pur-pose woidd be  served by  a  formal reply to thequestions submitted to.them, and on November14th they addressed to the Chairman of the Con-vention  a letter containing  a general statement                                   H 2
of their attitude on the financial problem.  Copiesof this letter were communicated at the sametime to all members  of the Sub-Committee.  Acopy is attached-Schedule VII.  Lord Southborough also submitted to us pro-posals for a compromise,  which were a develop-ment of a suggestion previously made by LordMidleton that Customs should be reserved to theImperial Parliament, and that Excise should bespecially considered.   Under these proposals  (ofwhich  a  copy is attached Schedule VIII.) theimposition of Customs Duties would remain withthe Imperial Parliament; the collection would becarried out under the authority of a Joint Boardand  an Irish  contribution: to Imperial Serviceswould be made,a first charge against the Customsrevenue. ,  The  remaining  sources of revenuewould be under the control  of the Irish Parlia-ment.  We are continuing our  sittings, and have stillto consider a proposal to be put forward by LordLondonderry.                       15th NOVEMBER, 1917.SCHEDULE  I.HEADS OF  THE  SCHEME.  1.

Ireland  to have  no share in the miscellaneous revenue of the Imperial Government (Suez  Canal Shares,  etc.)  As from the passing of the Act or the transferof any  services,  the Irish  Government  shouldassume  liability  for  all loans that  have beenmade in  Ireland, and for.  deposits  in savingsbanks, etc.  The question of land purchase is  dealt within the next  section.  17.  Land  Purchase.   The  Irish Governmentto assume all  responsibility for land  purchaseloans, excess stock and  bonus, and to be entitledto receive all payments to  be made by tenantpurchasers.  Future loans to be made  on the credit of  theIrish  Government, or, if  satisfactory  arrange-ments can be made, on the credit of the ImperialGovernment.  An  equitable  scheme of  land purchase thatwould be compulsory on owner and tenant alike,where voluntary  bargains  are not  forthcomingafter a certain period, could be sanctioned.  Thetotal  provision for excess  stock and bonus  atpresent  amounts  to   800,000 a year.  The subsidy  from  the tax  pa3&quot;er  for  pendingagreements  will,  owing to  changes in the priceof money, be at a much greater rate in pendingcases than  it  was  in  the  cases already com-pleted.  Another million, or more, may be neededfor the  unsold areas.  The  whole obligation islargely an Imperial one, and  Ireland should  getcredit for discharging it in considering the ques-tion of  an Imperial contribution.  18. Judicial Power.  The following provisionsof the Government of Ireland Act to be  adopted:    (a)  Safeguarding position  of  existing Irish          Judges (sec. 32).    (b)  Leaving  appointment  of  future  Judges          to  the Irish Government and their          removal to the Crown on address from          both Houses of Parliament  (sec.  27).    (c)  Transferring appeals from the House of          Lords   to  the  Judicial  Committee,          strengthened bv  Irish  Judges (sec.          28).    (d)  Extending right of appeal to this Court.          (Sec.  28  (4)  and Section 30  (1-2).    (e)  Provision  as to reference of  questions          of validity to Judicial Committee  (see          section 29).   19. Lord  Lieutenant.   The Lord Lieutenantto hold office for  6  years, and to be subject tono religious disqualification  (as in Act,  sect.  31).   20. Civm Service.   A Civil Service  Commis-sion  to  be  appointed  to  regulate competitiveexaminations for  admission to the public service,promotions, and the exercise of higher patronage.   Provision should be made f6r ensuring that inthe future  the salaries of Irish public  officials,appointed after the  passing of the Act, shall beupon a scale appropriate to Ireland.   21. Deferring  Taking  over certain  Irish)Services.   Arrangements to be made to permitthe Irish Government,  if they so desire, to defertaking over the  services relating to Land Pur-chase,  Old  Age  Pensions,  National Insurance,Labour Exchanges,  Post Office, Trustee SavingsBanks,  and Friendly Societies.          ,                               -  SCHEDULE  II.A  STATEMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL  CONCLUSIONS  AT  WHICH THE  SUB-               COMMITTEE HAD ARRIVED BY NOVEMBER  7th.  (The Heads referred to below are those of thescheme   submitted.*    The  provisional,  uhder-standings arrived&apos;at were all  contingent on  fullagreement on the general scheme being reached).                                          *See Schedule I.

House came down to  100 or 120  members itmight be convenient to reduce the Senate to 40members.   This would, involve a reconsiderationof the details of the  above scheme.  It was agreed that  the members of the UpperHouse  should  be  nominated for,  say,  sevenyears.             .                    .  Head  10.  Constitution of  House of Com-mons.   It was  agreed that the Unionists shouldbe  offered,  by  effective means, a proportion offorty per cent,  in the Lower House, and that inthe  Upper  House of,  say, forty, thirty shouldbe  men with a substantial stake in the country.The exact method of arriving at this result  wasleft for further consideration, but it was agreedthat it  could only be  obtained  by including  asubstantial  number of  nominated members.  Itwas suggested that,   in  order  to reduce  to  aminimum  this  undemocratic element  in  theHouse,  the  size of the House should be  smallerthan that proposed in  the scheme.  It was stipulated that the nominated elementin the Lower House should continue for not lessthan ten years.  Lord  Midleton suggested that, on the disap-pearance of this nominated element, an additionshould  be  made  to  the numbers of the  UpperHouse.    This was  reserved for further con-sideration.  Head 11.  Money Bills.   It was agreed thatthe  Senate  should have power to force  a jointsitting of both Houses over Money Bills.  Head  12.   Disagreement  between Houses.Agreed.  Head  13.  Bepresextation at  \Y estminstek.The Unionist representatives intimated that  this-was a sine qua iwn.   On the Nationalist side itwas stated  that,  while they did not favour thecontinuance  of representation in  the  ImperialParliament, pending  Federation  of the  UnitedKingdom, they did not look  upon its  cessationas  a sine qua non.  It was agreed  that any Irish representatives-at Westminster must have full power to deliber-ate and vote on all questions.  The  question whether Irish representatives atWestminster should  be directly elected or dele-gated by the Irish Parliament was  reserved forfurther  consideration.   It was suggested that thepresence of a  nominated  element in the IrishHouse  of  Commons  would probably  give  theUnionists for a time larger representation in  adelegation  appointed   by that House  than bymembers directly  elected.  Heads 14 and  15.   Finance.  Reserved forfurther  consideration.  The Nationalist  representatives  were  preparedto  accept a  guarantee of Free  Trade betweenGreat Britain  and Ireland,  at any  rate for  aterm of  years.   The  Unionists  were of opinionthat such a guarantee was inconsistent with theIrish control of Customs and Excise,  Head 16.   Imperial  Contribution..

Sub-head (6).  It is considered that &quot; control         of harbours  for naval and military  pur-       .  poses&quot; should be  substituted for &quot;con-        trol of naval harbours.&quot;  Head  4.&apos;  Is  accepted.   With  regard to  sub-head  1,  the provision  for  equal treatment  ofreligious  denominations  in future  must proceedfrom  a  basis  of equal  treatment  at present.That  is,  the disabilities,  etc.,  remaining underthe Act of  1829 should be annulled.  Head 5.  It is agreed that the question of thepower of  the Irish Parliament to amend its  Con-stitution  should  be  considered by  a  sub-com-mittee.  Head 6.  Is accepted,  with the understandingthat the Lord Lieutenant  is to  be a non-politicalpersonage.  Head  7.   Is accepted.  Head 8.

It was agreed  that the  Lords  Justices shouldbe subject to  no religious  disqualifications.  Head 20.   Civil Servants.   It was agreed-fchat a  strong Civil Service Commission shouldbe  established,  and  the  following  compositionwas suggested:    Lord Chancellor, Chairman; two  permanentmembers appointed by  the Lord Lieutenant, andholding office  during good behaviour.  The  practice  of the  English  Civil  ServiceCommission to be followed as far  as. possible.  Competitive examinations  to  regulate  admis-sion to the Service as far as possible. -  The   Unionist  members   having  expressedanxiety as to the exercise of patronage in  Ulster,it  was suggested  that  two additional membersmight  be added to  the Commission to  protecttheir interests.  It was agreed  that  the present  exercise  ofpatronage by the Lord  Chancellor would  requireto be reviewed,  and that there should, in  future,be  no  unpaid Magistrates.

Reserved forfurther consideration.         SCHEDULE III.PROPOSALS FOR A CONFERENCE.         Customs axd Excise.  The attached draft is an attempt to reconcilethree  propositions which  may  appear to  bealmost irreconcilable.  These propositions are:       1. That Ireland should have  complete  fiscal           autonomy.     2. That there should be Free Trade between           Great Britain and Ireland. &apos; -   3. That Ireland should have power to pro-           tect  her industries from unfair  corn-           petition by  British  Industries.  The draft is  only a  tentative suggestion, andshould  the principles  underlying it meet  withany degree of  acceptance, it  would  require  tobe  revised by experts both in Customs Adminis-tration  and in  the drafting of  Bills.  1. The Irish  Parliament shall, subject to  theprovisions of this Act, have full power to impose-customs  duties  on  all  articles  imported  intoIreland from  outside.  2. (1) The  Irish Parliament  shall not impose           customs duties on articles the produce,           growth  or   manufacture  of   Great           Britain, and the British Parliament           shall not  impose customs duties on           articles the produce, growth or manu-           facture of Ireland, save as hereinafter           provided.     (2) If the Irish Parliament imposes excise           duties  on any articles of Irish pro-           duce, growth or manufacture, it may           also  impose  equivalent customs duties           on  such  articles of  British  produce,           growth  or  manufacture;  and if  the           British Parliament   imposes  excise           duties  on  any articles of British pro-           duce, growth or manufacture, it may           also impose  equivalent customs duties           on  such  articles  of  Irish  produce,           growth  or manufacture.     iS) There  shall be  established  a Board to           be  called the  Joint  Customs Board,      &apos; &apos;.. &apos;  consisting of two members appointed   &apos;   &apos;&apos;   bv the Treasurv, and two  members            *J -            *J &apos;       .....   ,     appointed by the Irish  Treasury, and     a Chairman appointed by His Majesty.(4) If the Irish  Government be of opinion     that the producers, growers or manu-     facturers of any article in Ireland are     being subjected to  unfair competition     through the  importation  into Ireland     from Great Britain of  articles which     bv  reason  of  State  aid,  industrial     combination  or other cause are being     sold at a  price less  than the actual     cost of manufacture, distribution and     sale with the addition  of a fair com-     mercial profit; or if the British Gov-     ernment.....(etc.,  etc.,     mutatis  mutandis);  then  the Irish     Government  or the  British  Govem-     rnent,  as  the  case  may  be,  may     require the Joint Customs Board  to     investigate the  matter.(5) The Joint Customs Board, on being so     required,  shall investigate the matter     with  all   convenient   dispatch,  and     shall  report  to  both  Governments     whether in fact such  unfair compe-     tition  exists, and if so, what rate or     rates of customs duty or duties would     be sufficient  to counteract it.(6) On  the issue of  such a report, it shall     be lawful for  the  Irish  or  British     Parliament,  as  the  case may be,  to     impose customs duties on  the  said     articles of British  or  Irish  growth,     produce or manufacture to the extent     found by  the Joint Customs Board to     be sufficient  to counteract the unfair     competition.(7) Any customs duties imposed in accord-     ance with the provisions of  the fere-     going paragraph shall be immediately     discontinued  if  the Joint  Customs     Board, shall  report  that  the unfair     competition  which gave.rise  to their     imposition has  ceased.
                                      SCHEDULE  IV.LETTER FROM  CHAIRMAN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF NINE.My Lords  and Gentlemen,    At 3resterday&apos;s  meeting of your  Sub-Com-mittee a deadlock  appeared to have been reachedupon  the chief practical  issue the  Conventionhas to  decide  before it can frame a  system ofself-government for Ireland.  It was pointed out,on the one  hand, that, in the present state ofNationalist  opinion in Ireland, it  would be use-less  to propose any such  restriction upon thetaxing  powers of an Irish Parliament  as thereservation  of Customs  and Excise to the BritishParliament.   On  the  other  hand,  the UlsterUnionist members of the Sub-Committee statedthat,  even  if they were in agreement with theNationalist  majority,  those whom  they repre-sented  would not listen  for  a moment  to  anyproposal which would  enable the Irish Parlia-meut to set up a tariff  wall between Ireland andGreat Britain.  On  both sides, it seemed to befelt that further negotiation upon  this vital  issue(between fiscal autonomy and fiscal union) wouldbe a  mere  waste  of time, and that the GrandCommittee  should be so informed.  At  this   point  I  appealed  to  the  Sub-Com-mittee  to postpone a final conclusion until I hadhad an opportunity of putting to them in writingcertain questions, the  answers to wdiich wouldat any rate show  that the matter  in dispute hadbeen  fully  debated  and that  the opposite con-elusions had been dictated by a genuine wish topromote the best  interests of  the country.  In  taking this  course,  I had  two  objects inview first, I wished the question to be threshedout  in its  purely business aspects,  as it  wasimpossible  to avoid the impression  that its dis-cussion had  been largely  influenced  by senti-ment.   It is idle  to  ignore  the fact  that, tothe  great  majority  of  Irish  Nationalists,  fiscalautonomy,  advocated as a  means of  industrialdevelopment  at home and  of commercial expan-sion abroad, appeals, perhaps even more strongly,as  a  symbol of political  autonomy.   UlsterUnionists know this;  and, while they are, nodoubt,  convinced  that,  for  purely  practicalreasons, any disturbance  of  the present  fiscal arrangements would be undesirable, they upholdfiscal union as something more than a symbol ofpolitical union.   Again,  while the  Nationalists believe that Great Britain&apos;s fiscal  policy is neces- sarily  governed  by British  rather  than  Irish interests, Ulster Unionists fear that an Irish fiscal policy would, in the present state  of public opinion down South, be actuated by anti-British motives. And even  if, after  the settlement of the Irish Question,  such matters were  sure to be consid- ered on their merits, the business men of Ulster fear  that,  with the  best wishes  in the world,  a parliament predominantly agricultural wrould  be incapable   of understanding  the  problems  of  a highly industrialised community.   As  long  as  the  practical  business  questions before us  are debated with  these mental  reser- vations, we are dealing with  false  issues.   I do not,  for  a  moment,  underrate the  practical importance  of  the  sentimental considerations involved.   They  must weigh  on  both sides; but they can  and  should  be  distinguished from the business considerations  so that  the  latter  can. be  discussed upon  their merits.  To this  end we must also assume and I  am sure our Ulster friends will  agree  to  assume    that,  in  its economic   policy, the  Irish  Parliament will  be                 Irish Convention,             Dublin, 6th November, 1917.guided  by  common  sense.   The questions Isubmit  herewith  are based  on this assumption.  My second purpose in  thus addressing you isto call  your attention  to the critical  stage  atwhich we have arrived in the proceedings of theConvention, and  to tell you frankly what I,  asChairman, consider its  proper course in the dis-charge  of its  awful  responsibility.   It  is quitetrue that if, after the further consideration I amabout to  ask has been  given to  the  main issuein dispute,  no compromise  seems possible, wemay abandon all hope  of an agreed settlementfor a united Ireland.   But if,  unhappily, anygroup in the Convention is unable to reach agree-ment on  certain  vital  issues, the  responsibilityof framing a constitution  for Ireland will rest onthe  main body.  Its deliberations should lead,at any  rate, to  one  good result namely, thatthe  issues of  the controversv will be  narrowedand  defined.   While we should not have settledthe  Irish Question, we  should have made it farmore amenable to settlement than we  found it.  I  devoutly hope  that some compromise mayyet  be found upon the  crux  which has  so nearlybrought us to a deadlock.  What I plead  for atthe  moment is that we&quot; should go steadily  aheadwith our work of  exploring the Irish  politicalproblem in all its aspects.   Then, if we cannotcome to a complete  agreement,  as many of usas possible must endeavour  to submit  proposalsfor a broad and equitable settlement of the IrishQuestion to the judgment of  our countrymen andof the  world.                Yours faithfully,                     HORACE   PLUNKETTEnclosures.    Questions for  Ulster  Representatives.    Questions for  Nationalist Representatives.    Note on possible Compromises.   Questions for Ulster Representatives.  1. Are you afraid that an Irish  Parliamentmight  impose  taxes on  the raw material  ormachinery  of your industries?  If so, would your fear  be met by a provisionthat there should be free trade between Englandand Ireland (i.e.,  that neither country  shouldimpose customs duties on goods produced in theother  without imposing an equivalent  excise)?  Alternatively7, would you  be  satisfied  bv aprohibition of import duties in Ireland on specificraw materials or machinery?  2. Are you afraid of your exports being exposedto customs  duties in England if England becameprotectionist? . Would this objection be met by provisions forfree trade between the two countries  as above?  3. Are you, generally speaking, afraid of fric-tion between Ireland  and England,  leading  totariff  wars?  Would the above safeguard satisfy  you?  4. Are you afraid that Ireland&apos;s tariff arrange-ments with  foreign countries might cause frictionbetween Ireland and England?(Balance of A-ppendiccs to follow).
