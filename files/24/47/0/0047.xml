During the past week the conditions in the Labour world have, on the whole,been quiet, and indications point to a general acceptance of the man-power demandsalready made by the Government.  In tnis report for last week reference was made toa conference held by delegates of the A.S.E. and shop stewards at Manchester on the21st March, which passed resolutions approving a strike on the 6th April if the comb-out were continued.  On the 27th March the Arrangements Committee, which wasresponsible for calling that conference, met and decided to rescind the resolutions.Organised opposition from the members of this society to existing arrangements may,therefore, be considered at an end.    The  Miners&apos; Federation is also unlikely to depart from its resolution to assistthe Government in the comb-out with the use  of its machinery.  During the weeklocal opposition to man-power proposals has resulted in some small and insignificantstrikes in Lanarkshire, which, however,  have now ended.    In many factories and shipyards work continued throughout the Easter holidays,but from the Tyne reports have been received which indicate that in certain yardsnot only were the holidays taken, but slackness in returning to work after the holidayshas been noticed.  The general impression is, however, that the German offensive hasemphasised the national peril, and  brought home to  all  sections their responsibilityto the armies  and  the  country.  The alteration in the general tone of the  extremepress is remarkable, and recalls the early days of the war (see Part II).    The  Easter holidavs have seen  the annual conference of the I.L.P. at Leicester,and that  of the B.S.P. at Leeds.  Both of these conferences have been remarkable for      [1100-23]                                                     B
the dissatisfaction which has been expressed with the policy and constitution of theLabour Party.  In the case of the B.S.P. a definite proposal to disaffiliate was madebut was rejected in favour of a ballot of all the members on the subject.  At the I.L p&apos;meeting on Easter Monday, Mr. Snowden made a virulent attack upon the Govern-ments of Great Britain and of  France.  In the course of his speech he said that thepainful failure of the Labour Party had made a Labour Government at the presenttime neither feasible nor desirable.  His speech was in an ultra-pacifist vein, thoughhe admitted that the present moment was unfavourable for peace propaganda,  Hisopinion apparently is that conditions for pacifist agitation will be speciallv favour-able directly the German offensive is definitely stopped.   It is incjeed to be anticipatedthat effective action to overcome the German offensive will be immediately followedby an outcry for peace on the part of all pacifist parties.    The Labour  papers of the week naturally have no  reference to the expectedamendment of the Military Service Acts.  Opposition to any drastic extension of theage for military service is to be anticipated, especially if the extension is in a down-ward direction.   Still more is this likely to be the case if the proposals include anyprovisions which may be, rightly or wronglv, interpreted as conscription of labour.    The official  announcement made  by the  Labour Party, and published in thismorning&apos;s papers (4th March),  that in view of the uncertainty of the situation on theWestern front the national campaign in support of the party&apos;s war aims and policyof social reconstruction is to be abandoned is a clear proof that the Labour Party isdetermined to do nothing to embarrass the Government in the efficient  prosecutionof the  war, and justifies the  conclusion that at the present time the country as awhole is solid behind the Government to that end.                             II. PRESS COMMENTS.The German Offensive.    The Labour  and Socialist press  is like the rest of the country&apos;s press at themoment, very much preoccupied with the military situation.  Military events  ferse  are not dealt with, but the gravity of the situation  is recognised on all hands,and even the avowedly pacifist papers, except, perhaps, the &quot; Call,&quot; are moderate intone.  The &quot; Herald &quot; deals with the subject in no less than five places.  Two of thearticles are  merely sentimental,  but  apart  from  this  there  is a most significantappeal from Messrs.  Cole and Hutchinson of the A.S.E. strongly deprecating anypolicy of strike, and Mr. Brailsford, who finds the origin of the German attack in theVersailles declaration, says  that.&quot; it is idle to talk of peace until the result of thebattle is known.&quot;  In the editorial page &quot; sympathy and  admiration &quot; are expressedfor the  troops.  The &quot;^Labour  Leader &apos;&apos; is somewhat colder,  and also regards theGerman offensive  as a reply to Versailles: &quot;It has followed on a greater  scale thecourse of previous offensives  ....  the final outcome will be similar.&apos;&apos;  Otherpapers of the I.L.P. press are warmer; the &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot;  speaks of &quot; quietconfidence,&quot;&quot; and the &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot;  says that the &quot; hearts of all Englishmen andwomen go out to the army.&quot;   The &quot;  Woolwich Pioneer &quot; finds the appeal for muni-tions  &quot; hardly necessary &quot; &quot; the goods will be delivered.&quot;    The attitude  of  the other wing is very much what might have been expected.&quot;Justice &quot;  and the &quot;British Citizen &quot; follow very  similar lines.   They are alikehortatory, and emphasise the need for &quot; national unity &quot; in the &quot; battle for civilisa-tion.&quot;  The &quot; Clarion &quot;  is of opinion that the pen can be of little service, but pointsthe moral of Russia as indicating the need for unitv.   This spirit of confidence is alsobreathed by the more  bourgeois &quot; Nation,&quot; &quot; New Witness,&quot; and &quot; New Statesman.&quot;Foreign Affairs.     Interest in Japanese intervention in Siberia  is still displayed by the &quot; LabourLeader,&quot; which finds the cause of the delay which has occurred in the &quot; unwilling-ress  of  President   Wilson  to  approve  a- course of action hostile to the RussianRevolution&apos;&apos; The  &quot;Call&quot;  is  more violent,  reminds  the workers that Japan isextremely reactionary, and asserts that no reliance can be put in Mr. Balfour&apos;s pro-fissions as to her &quot; spirit of  perfect  loyalty and disinterestedness.&quot;  The &quot; BradfordPioneer &quot; also attacks, if less bitterly, the Foreign Secretary&apos;s attitude.     The&quot; Call&quot;  is more moderate, though still hostile,  over the question of Dutch^hipping   The, &quot;  Leeds Citizen &quot; puts up  a somewhat  half-hearted defence of the
 Allied Governments, while the &quot; British Citizen &quot; points out that their action is in no sense illegal.     As regards  the Russian situation, the &quot; Clarion &quot; is confident that the present position will be altered, and thinks that it should be a spur to military action  The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; referring to the Reichstag debate, applauds the &quot;&quot;strong line of opposition taken by the Majority Socialists.&quot;  &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, cannot ,find any hope either m the German workers or in the German Socialists. Man-Power.     In view of the military situation the interest shown in the man-power question has revived  somewhat.  The anti-strike article in the &quot;Herald &quot;  has already been noticed.  The Manchester resolution receives practically no support, though curiously enough it is, except by the &quot; Clarion &quot; and &quot; British Citizen,&quot; not  much condemned. &quot;Justice&quot; thinks that &quot;too serious attention &quot; is paid to sensationalism,  and is afraid that the main problem, which is that of the dilutees, may be lost sight of.  This is very much the attitude of the  &quot; New Witness,&quot;  which prints &quot; the case for the A.S.E.&quot;  Even the &quot; Herald &quot; finds the resolution &quot; difficult to explain,&quot; and thinks that &quot; behind the men&apos;s minds was the desire for peace,&quot; and that  the &quot; Government and its  agents have to bear the greatest share of  blame.&quot;  The  &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is sure that, in face of the acute national emergency that  has arisen, there is room for little or no speculation &quot; as to  the result of the new ballot.&quot;  As regards the miners opinion is somewhat similar.   &quot; Justice &quot; points out the inconsistency of the vote on the two questions  which were put, and thinks that it is  a &quot; ridiculous situation,&quot; but the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; regards the vote as indicating a &quot; very remark- able change of opinion.&quot; Food.     Apart from a continuation of excellent defence of State Control-and the Ministry of Food, which is appearing in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; this subject attracts little attention. Articles  on  the work of  the Consumers&apos;  Council appear in the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Justice,&quot; and suggest that this body is not only interested in its  work, but is also interesting the Labour world in its doings.     The &quot;New Witness&quot; grumbles at the delay in settling the question of extra rations for heavy workers, and is inclined to attack tlie decision to allot this from the stocks of bacon, while  the &quot;New  Statesman &quot; demands further information about the flat rate for margarine.   Profiteering is dealt with bv the &quot; Bradford Pioneer and &quot; Labour Leader &apos;&apos;; the latter paper is particularly bitter at the increase in profits made by the Maypole Company, at a time when working women were stand- ing for hours in margarine  queues. Education.     This subject continues to attract attention, which is, however, in certain cases wandering somewhat wide of the  Education  Bill.   The &quot;Labour  Leader &quot; doubts whether Mr.  Fisher  will be able to find the teachers, without whom his plans are likely to break down, and blames the policy which has been pursued  in the past.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; exhorts the textile workers to vote for the abolition of child labour under the  age of fourteen. Shipbuilding.     There is a remarkable decline in the amount of space devoted to this topic.  The  New Witness &quot;  attacks the appointment of Lord Pirrie, a capitalist, and finds &quot;he applause  which  followed  even more disastrous than the appointment itself.  The &apos;; Call&quot; is very pessimistic, and wonders &quot; how any ships have got built at all in faceof the blundering and departmental jealousy of the bureaucracy.&quot;Conscientious Objectors.    A recent letter from Mr. Bernard Shaw to the  &quot;Manchester Guardian &quot; seemsonce more to have attracted attention to this subject.  The &quot; Labour Leader  &quot; notesthis  &quot;revival of interest,&quot; and attacks the authorities for their method of  dealingwith the problem, while the &quot; Herald \T refers to the further &quot; startling and sickeningparticulars &quot; which have come to light.
                             III. DISTRICT REPORTS. London and South-Eastern.     The situation in this area seems to be satisfactory.  The  discharges for the army  of semi-skilled and unskilled workmen  at Woolwich are  steadily  increasing in number, but so far no opposition has been  reported.   A meeting of the Arsenal shop stewards, however, has already been held to consider this question,  and the A.S.E. shop stewards are calling a conference to decide what line of  action should be adopted.     At Enfield the workers in the Small Arms Factory and the Gunpowder Factory have decided unanimously to oppose the resolution passed at the Manchester con- ference. West Midlands.     The position in this area appears to be calm.     A better feeling exists as  regards the man-power proposals, and no stoppage of work is thought likely.  The feeling of members of  the  A.S.E. seems  to  have been  influenced to a great extent by the  criticism of other unions, and many are inclined to accept the  Governments  proposals without  further opposition.     Opposition is expressed by the Coventry Joint Engineering Committee, which has pledged  itself to resist the Government until all dilutees are removed.     In view of the present urgent  need, the Easter holiday  in  most  of  the works was given up  without  any opposition.     At  Birmingham the  Trades Council, a somewhat pacifist  body, is about to demand the immediate release of all conscientious objectors.  The I.L.P. continues its activities in this district, and ex-Private Simmons, who is  a well-known pacifist, has been appointed local organiser. Yorkshire and East Midlands.    Some improvement is reported in this area, and the situation seems more quiet.     It seems improbable that the threats of strikes upon the question of the comb-out will now be  carried out, and in Sheffield  particularly  the situation is  decidedly better.   The opinion seems prevalent among the local Trade Union officials that the Shop Stewards&apos; Committee here is not conducing to a  peaceful  feeling among the workers.    A meeting of the A.S.E.  at Leeds on the 24th was comparatively moderate in feeling,  though a resolution endorsing the attitude of the Manchester conference was ultimately passed.   There  was considerable opposition,  however, and it  was pointed out that the position  of the A.S.E. would be endangered by striking when there was no chance of  success.  Another member appealed against a strike upon patriotic grounds, but a section of  the meeting received his  remarks coldly.  An amendment urging that no action upon the lines advised by the Manchester  con- ference should  be taken until after the official vote had been received failed to gain a  majority.  It may  be noted,  however, that  this meeting took  place before the seriousness of the situation in France had been fully realised.N orth-W estern.    The position in this area  shows a great improvement, except for unrest among farm labourers in Cheshire, which is dealt with in Part IV. -    Feeling upon the man-power question has  shown a distinct improvement since the German offensive, and the view seems general that the present crisis is not a time for industrial strife.  Many willingly gave up their Easter holiday in con- sequence.    Both at Barrow and Liverpool it is believed that whatever  demands the Govern- ment makes at this moment will be received without trouble, and at  Manchester, &quot; in view of the grave crisis in France,&quot; the resolution to strike, passed on the 21st, was again withdrawn, and members were requested to remain at  work, though the opinion was expressed that dilutees fit for service should be taken before  skilled engineers.    It is believed in this area that the official ballot will be favourable  to  the Government.
Northern.     The situation in this area is on the whole quiet.   No agitation upon the man-power question  is reported.  Some unrest has, however,  been occasioned by thequestion of wages in Newcastle, where the chargemen in the engineering works andshipyards are demanding an increase of 11. per week.   They do not seem to receivesupport from either their union or fellow-workers.     The alleged  inadequacy of the  food supply continues to give  rise to muchgrumbling,  and there have been.complaints that&apos;the rationed  quantities cannot beobtained.   The position is aggravated by rumours which have  been set on foot thatsupplies are abundant in other districts.South Wales.     The condition of Labour throughout this district continues to be satisfactory,though some unrest is still evident among the miners.     The South Lanarkshire Reform Committee have, however, addressed a circularto the Unofficial Reform Committee of the South-Wales  Miners&apos; Federation, withthe object of stirring up agitation in this district upon  the Man-Power Bill, andbringing the miners out on strike upon the 6th April.   A special  conference was tobe held at Cardiff on the 2nd  to decide what  attitude should be adopted  towardsthese proposals.Scotland.     Conditions in this district appear in general to be quiet, and only small  andunimportant strikes have taken place.     It is now  considered highly improbable that the vote of  the A.S.E.  membersupon the man-poAver question will  prove unfavourable to the  Government, thoughon the 24th, before the serious nature of the present situation had been properlyrealised, a meeting of the A.S.E. voted in favour of resisting the Government unlessit made a clear declaration of war aims.     The policy of the Government as regards shipbuilding still receives adversecriticism in this area, and much bitterness has been aroused among the workmen bywhat they consider the Governments  unfair action in casting the blame for pastmistakes on them.     The Glasgow YVorkers&apos; Peace Committee is still active in its attempt to stir upagitation by means of  a propagandist manifesto.     Among the miners an extremist section, calling themselves the South Lanark-shire Reform Committee, continue to oppose the comb-out, and have issued a  circularwith the object of bringing out all the miners in Great Britain.   The ringleadersare two men named Hogg and Main waring; they are not expected to meet  withmuch success.                                 IY. DISPUTES.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The general situation appears to be satisfactory this week, and few strikes ofany importance are reported.    The Shipyard Labour Department has five new cases of stoppages to report, andthese  have&apos; involved 338 workmen.  Sixteen old cases are also  reported, and of theiota!  number work has  already  been resumed  in  eighteen cases.    A  more recentreport states that only two strikes, involving some seventy men, are now in progress           A partial resumption of work has been obtained  at Messrs.  Scoffs and Co., where a       small number of sheet-iron workers ceased work on  the 11th March.  The remainder of the       men out on strike have probably obtained work elsewhere, though  many are reported to be       returning  and the majority of the non-unionists are joining the union.  Some unrest  exists       at Messrs  -J Howden anil Co., Glasgow, where 150 engineers ceased  work owing  to the       posting up of A.S.E. notices in the works.  Work  has now beeu  resumed after two short       stoppages   Arising out of the recent strike, several conferences have taken place between       the firm and the men at Messrs. Harland and Wolff and Messrs. Workman, Clark, and Co.,       Belfast, but so far no agreement has been reached.   The men held a mass meeting on the       30th March.       [1100-23]                                                       C
     The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 9,736 workers involved in strikesfor the week ending the 27th March.     The total number of days lost was 44,563.    The largest number  of workpeopleinvolved is m the Yorkshire district, which shows a totafof 6,939.            The strike  at the National Ordnance Factories, Leeds, regarding the alleged victimisa-         tion of four men,  and which involved some 3,000  workers, came  to an  end on the  27th         March, on the understanding that an independent enquiry into the merits of the case should         be conducted.            An important strike, which has been previously mentioned, took place at the Chipperin?         Explosives  Works, where  1,500 carpenters,  bricklayers, and. labourers ceased work.   The         men are attempting to intimidate workers from  other firms in order to force the hands of         their own employers.   The Lord Mayor, who has apparently considerable influence  amon*         trade unionists, has intervened in order to secure a resumption of work, and work has now         been resumed.            By the efforts of the  local officer of the  Ministry of Munitions, the  extension  of the         strike at Messrs. Hotchkiss&apos;s Works, Coventry, was prevented.  Dingley, the shop steward,         and a few of his friends are still out of work, and have placed their case before the A.S.E.        Eecent military events are reported to have stopped the agitation.     The  War  Office  Contracts Department  has only  one new  stoppage to report,while there are apparently none outstanding from previous weeks.            This strike occurred at Messrs. Albrecht  and Albfecht, Limited,  Leeds, on the  20th        March, and involves about  1,200 workers.   It  was caused by  a demand for increased piece        rates, and has not apparently received the sanction of the head office, though it has  been        organised by the  local secretaries  of the union.  No  real grounds  for complaint seem  to        exist, and the Employers&apos; Association have decided to  let the strike  continue.     The Coal  Controller reports seventeen  new stoppages  during the  week, in allof  which  cases work has already been resumed.    These involved over  6,000 men inScotland and about 5,000  in Wales.            At the  Farme Colliery, Lanarkshire, a dispute occurred with regard to the employment        of a contractor  of Polish nationality, who was alleged to pay less  than the usual rate of        wages.  The men are now demanding the dismissal of all Poles employed in the  colliery.            Thirteen stoppages lasting for one daj&quot; occurred in  Lanarkshire owing to the Decertifica-        tion Order,  but these seem to have been undertaken as protests rather than with  the object        of preventing recruiting.   There still seems to be a possibility of  trouble  in this district.        however.            A  strike of  some significance has occurred among the farm hands in part of Cheshire.        The number of men involved is not large, and details of the affair have not yet been received,        but it  is said to have been instigated by  the National  Farm and  Dairy Workers1 Union,        which is showing activity in other parts of the  country also.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.     The Shipyard Labour Department has 32 new controversial  cases to report, and127 which have been already mentioned.    In 36 cases settlements have now beeneffected.     None of  these cases appear  to be of great importance, nor  does it seem likelythat they will have serious consequences.     The Ministry of Munitions reports seven controversial cases.            The most important of these is a case of alleged victimisation at the Davidson Aircraft        Co., London, where a shop steward was discharged for incompetence.   The men threatened        to bring  out 25,000 engineers unless he were reinstated.  The firm  were recommended to        take this course, on the ground that the complaints were made against the man for machine        work, not for the fitter&apos;s work for which he was  engaged.            An interesting dispute which the Brassworkers&apos; Society threaten  to make a test case has        occurred  at Messrs.  Blair,  Campbell,  and Maclean, Glasgow, owing to the discharge of an        exrsoldier employed on core-making.   The union claim that  this is contrary to  the spirit        of the Munitions Act, which lays it down that in readjustments of the staff priority should        be given to men who have served.with the Colours.  In spite of  the fact that the man in        question was in the fhm&apos;s  employ  before he  joined the Army, another coremaker has been        retained rather  than him.            Two strikes are threatened in Manchester  with regard to the  12  per cent, bonus,  and        another complaint upon the same matter has been received  from  H.M.  Filling Factory.        Barnbow, with  regard  to  non-payment  of the bonus  to employees in  the  chemical  and        explosives trades.     The War Office Contracts Department has no fresh controversial cases to report.Three, which have been previously reported, are, however, still unsettled.            As regards the application for a general advance in the wool industry, a conference has        been held between emplovers in the Yorkshire  dyeing  industry and  the  Amalgamated        Societv of Dvers, as a result of which the operatives will be recommended to adopt a system
                                          /        similar to that in operation in Lancashire.   The dyers&apos; unions are to be balloted upon the        proposed arrangement.            At the Elswick Leather  Works it has now been arranged that the wages for curriers        shall be brought up to the level of those recently granted to skilled curriers in Scotland.     The Coal Controller reports  one  new  case  of dispute.   Thirteen old casesremained from previous weeks, and in three cases settlements are reported.     None of these cases appears to be of much importance.     The Committee on Production have heard  38 arbitration cases during the week 23 in London and 15 in Scotland.   Four of these cases were connected with the12^ per cent, bonus.  An important question has been raised on a recent award as towhether the women, employed on the tramways at Bradford and Burnley should bepaid at the same rates as the men whose places they have filled.     The Chief Industrial Commissioner has had 168 differences reported during theweek, of which 70 are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus.   Seventy of these cases fallin the engineering and  shipbuilding group.            The National Transport Workers&apos; Federation are now claiming 8d. per  hour over pre-        war  rates for  clock labourers through the  United  Kingdom.   They  desire  to  obtain  a        national agreement, and at a conference which  has been held joint terms of reference were        agreed upon to be placed before the Committee on Production.            The building trade employers and operatives have agreed to hold a conference on the        question of setting up a Conciliation Board.                                                      D.  J.
