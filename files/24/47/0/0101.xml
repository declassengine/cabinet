H*0[Q        -     (Circulated  by. the&apos;Home  Secretary)   .   .    10th April, 1918.  tfALLjiQ^t was natural to expect that  the effect  of the  German dealings frith    Russia would not have worn out during the  last  three weeks, and that the    German offensive would have  had a profound reaction upon  pacifism and revo-    lutionary sentiment in this  country, but I was  not prepared for reports which    I have received from more than one centre, writing independently, to the effect    that the working-man-has-been-impressed by Prince Lichncwsky&apos;s memorandum,    v/hich appears to be thoroughly well understood&quot; as being a proof that this    country  had no responsibility in respect of the declaration of Y.&apos;ar. . A certain    number jbf the Independent Labour Party pacifists appear to have been shaken    in their views.  My.correspondent in Sunderland quotes from one of them as    saying, &quot;The- end of the !7ar, from V.&quot;Military point of  view, looks as far off    as ever, but as long as the  German workers support their  Army, it is useless    to talk of Peace. -.Y.*e hope,  however, that  the workers  in  Germany will see the    folly of supporting their Military rulers, and When they  take action, we ought    to meet them.,&quot;-          There has been an almost entire cessation of public meetings to advocate    immediate Peace,  The only bodies which have made public  appeals during the    past three weeks are the &quot;foment Peace Crusade, and a  new body formed at    Glasgow5 under the name of the Y.rorkers ! Peace Committee,  composed of repre-    sentatives of the British Socialist Party&quot;, the Independent Labour Party., and    the Clyde Tforkers&apos; Committee.   Both  these bodies have been active at Glasgow,    and the latter has prepared a., manifesto on the familiar lines :.f  &quot;Stop the V*ar &quot;     !No Indemnities.. No Annexations&apos;, &apos;.General Disarmament&apos;. &apos;Freedom of Speech and    of the Press V  5A Workers&apos; Government&apos;. *Better Conditions fv.:r VJorkers&apos;. etc-.    They are holding over this manifesto for the moment,  in order to await the-    result of the German offensive, when they  hope that&quot; the public will be more    ready to listen to them.          I hear that the Union of Democratic  Control have instructed their    members not to agitate for Peace in public just now,  and  the Independent    Labour Party and the British Socialist Party are abstaining from Public    Meetings, because they believe they would  be broken up. .At Sheffield,-whioh    has lately been a &quot;storm centre, ^the United Socialists&apos; Campaign was    financially unsuccessful, and Dr. Chandler has had ta  lend  100 to the    Committee to meet the expenses *          The German offensive has had a remarkable effect upon the1 revolutionary    body in London,- especially upon the aliens, who seem  at last to have realised    that their real, sympathies are with-the Allies.          At a Mass Meeting of workers at Woolwich Arsenal last Wednesday, a    Resolution was passed^ pledging the Engineers to support  the- IVar &quot;until the    German Military machine is smashed&quot;.  &quot;That this Meeting  says; Not Peace by    Negotiation with the present rulers of Germany&quot;. &quot;The  Resolution completely    condemned&apos; Ramsey Mao&amp;onald aneV Philip Snowden \by name.          The representatives of the ,Nor-thEast Coast Shipbuilding and Engineering    Employers and Workmen despatched messages  on the 4th to the Prime Minister,    Field Marshal Haig, and Admiral Beatty, promising to  increase their efforts
   &quot;until complete Victory has or owned our arms&quot; *         On the other hand, signs of future trouble are not wanting.   In Glasgou   and at other centres, there is consternation at the prospeot of the age  being   raised.  The men between forty and fifty were quite ready to use their   influence te send the young men to the Colours, but how that there  is a   porspect that they themsleves may be oalled upon, they are inclined to raise   $gain the ory of Industrial Conscription.  I believe that if they knew that   Conscription was to be introduced into Ire land , they would be more  inclined   to accept the position, but as long as they see Irishmen of military age,   coming over to jobs in this country, it is difficult to get them te believe   that their national existence dependa, upon every fit man taking his ahare  of   danger.         The miners are restless, and talk of repudiating their offioials.  They   say that Smillie^ aoqulesoence in the Government proposals for a &quot;ocmb  out&apos;   is taotical, and that he could, if he liked* lead the rank and file in an   effective resistance to the &quot;comb out&quot;.         The Paoifists are making great preparations for the May Day celebration   on May 5th in Fins bury Park, where they hope to sell a great deal of &quot;advanced&quot;   literature .         It is not too much to say that the worst form of Pacifism for the  moment   is the tea-party and dinner table tittle-tattle in London.  Certain ladies of   position, who profess to be in close touch with the offioial worldg are  busy   disseminating this kind of poison, and the worst feature of it is that it  is   the kind of paoifism which is founded on despair.  Fortunately, their   activities are confined, more or less, to their own class, and do not reach   the class below them.         The Navy League have been holding very suo^ssful  Patriotic Meetings   in Glasgow lately.  The speakers are very rarely heckled. Mrs Pankhurst  hac   also been speaking at Manchester with good effect,        Ex-Private C. 3* Simmons was sentenced to three monthfs&apos; hard  labour,   and fined  25 for a speech he made at an Independent Labour Party Meeting,   urging men to refuse to serve in the Army, and to refrain from making   munitions,THE INDEPENDNET LABOUR PARTY.         .Xehnson* the Secretary of the Independent Labour Party, says  that  the   membership has nearly doubled during the last twelve months. He does not think   that a fusion with the British Socialist Party would be either useful or   desirable. He hopes to have sixty members of the Party in the field at the   next election, and to, have twenty returned.         The Independent Labour Party Conference at Leicester on April 1st  and   2nd has not done the Party any good. My correspondent thinks that it has only   had the effect of further isolating it from the Labour Party.THE&quot;HERALD&quot;*         The circulation of ijhe &quot;Herald&quot; is said now to be 60,000 a week, but.   owing to the price of paper, it ie not paying,THE PACIFIST DELEGATION 10 AMERICA,         The three Pacifists, Stewart Burning,British Delegate attaohed to  the   PoBt Offioe Unions Carl Goexhad, Frenoh Delegate, and Camille Huysmans,   Belgian Delegate, intended to embark for New York on the R.M.S, &quot;New York&quot;,   on the 27th March, but the docks were picketed by the Seamen*s and  Firemen&apos;s
        Union, who had decided to strike if the men were taken on board. The        Authorities of the American Line assured the Union officials-that they vrould        not take these men as passengers, but the pickets were posted, nevertheless.        The three men failed to put in an appearance.  On the 4th they attempted toj        go to France * with the same result.  I have reason to believe that Huysmans        has produced a bad impression on Labour men in this country, who are doubtful        as to what his real objects are. Some of them think that he is a German        Agent, others, that he is playing for his own hand*  He is a man of extra-        ordinary personal vanity.  He intended to spend six weeks in America, and        then go to Switzerland for a week, in order to confer with German Socialists        before returning to London. He was confident that he would induce Gompers to        change his present attitude, for he was satisfied that if the Americans held        aloof, no International Conference would suoceed.\  THE INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN BROTHERHOOD,              A Meeting of the International Christian Brotherhood was held at        Kingsway Hall.cn the 14th March, v/ith Lord Parmoor in the Chair, the Dean of        Worcester, the Reverend Prinoipal Selbie, Canon Donaldson, and Father        Nicholas Velimirovio, of Serbia, as speakers.  The speeches were not        political, though one of the speakers said, &quot;As the Prime Minister pleaded        for a vigorous prosecution of the TCar, I think we ought to plead for a        vigorous prosecution of Peace&quot;. SINN FEIN AND LABOUR.              A determined effort is being made by the Sinn Fein Party to get into        touch with the Independent Labour and Socialist Parties, in the hope of        causing trouble in this country, without which, any further Revolutionary        movement in Ireland would be ineffectual.. Two or three agents have oome over        with this object, but they are kept closely under observation, and so far,        their proceedings have been so inept that they are suspected by the extremists        of being &quot;agents provooateur&quot;, BOLSHEVIST PROPAGANDA IN THIS COUNTRY FROM AMERICA.              A series of Meetings attended by about 400 delegates of Russian        Societies kuswn as the Tovarishi, who are politically related to the        Bolsheviki, have been held in New York.  It is decided to organise the        Russian Labour element throughout  the States, under a Central Soviet Body,        and there was much talk of the &quot;Forerunner of Social Revolution&quot;, &quot;the        inspiration of a new Civilisation&quot;, and&quot;the symbol of the Proletariat^        final triumph over the Imperialistic and Capitalistic forces that now rule        the world&quot;.  Some attempt has been made to introduce the propaganda into        England. A salaon watchman on board the s.s. &quot;Carpathia&quot;, named A.

The letters he was carrying were of the usual        Bolshevik kind.iBOLSHEVIKS IN ENGLAND.L             Three prominent Bolsheviks in the North of England are to be deported&apos;       next week, and others, even more undesirable, have applied for leave to go        back to Russia.

join, the Army.-Litvinoff has not adhered to the spirit of his undertaking notto engage in political agitation in this oountry.  He has addressed lettersto the British Socialist Party and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, and he isapplying for money from Russia to defray the expenses of the Consulate atGlasgow,, (where he appointed the deporteet John Molean as Consul), though heis aware that the British Government declines to recognise McLean,  JohnMaoLean lately signed; certificates as Russian Consul, for men applying to?fork in munition faotories.                                        ,4H34-58
