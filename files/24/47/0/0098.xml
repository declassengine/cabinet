                         IJi This Document is the Property oTHis Britannic Majesty^ &quot;Government.)428War Cabinet.Channel Train Ferry Service.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,           I circulate for the information of mjrcolleaguesthe subjoined note on the working of the Channel Train PerryService.Derby.10th April, 1918.           Three vessels were delivered towards the end oflaBt year, and were then put through very careful and exhaustivetrials and the officers and crews trained in the handling ofthe craft, which naturally took some little time, owing to thefact that they are unique vessels as far as British shippingpractice goes.           The vessels developed certain minor defects such asinsufficient immersion of the suction pipe, the awkward fixingof the rubbing strake, etc, but in view of the novelty ofconstruction the difficulties were surprisingly few.  Afterthese defects had been put right the vessels were engaged ontrial ships under load conditions between Southampton and Havrepending the completion of the Frenoh terminals.   Thisexperience in handling them proved invaluable, and it waspossible to start a regular scheduled service on the 10th March.           Two vessels operate between Richborough and Calaisand one vessel between Southampton and Dieppe.           The terminal facilities, electrically operatedaccess bridge, etc, on both sides have worked admirably and nohitch whatever has occurred either in loading or dischargingthese vessels.  A daily service has been maintained betweenCalais and Richborough since 11th March and between Southamptonand Dieppe a two-days service could have been maintained butfor lack of escort.           The vessels are efficiently armed, and it is forconsideration whether if the usefulness of the service islikely to be seriously handicapped,    owing to lack of escort,the Army Council should not assume responsibility for runningthem without escort.  It would be regrettable that these vesselswhich are doing so much to relieve shipping should be detainedfor these reasons.           The time occupied in loading, that is to say,from the stopping of the engines on entering the berth untilthe engines are started again to proceed to sea, has taken onthe average twenty minutes.  In this time any empty wagons areoff-loaded and the vessel reloaded with a full cargo of fiftyto fifty-four wagons.                                                      As
          Ae regards their sea worthiness, they have provedvery much &quot;better than was expected, now that the officers andcrews have become accustomed to handling them, and therewould be no hesitation in running them in almost anyweather short of a full gale if necessity arose.  They havemade the passage in a moderate gale, with wind at Force 7,and during this voyage experiments were carried out with regardto the lashing of the wagons.  At present elaborate precautions,are taken that is to say, chain lashings on each end of thewagons and 4 Bottle-jacks to each wagon are used.  In thisinstance two wagons were entirely freed and all lashings andjacks were cast off.  With the ship rolling 20  to eitherside in 4 seconds, absolutely no movement could be detectedin the free wagons and the ship and cargo were perfectly stable.          During the month the following cargo was moved fromBichborough:-          770 War Office railway wagons (For use in France,)          253 Wagons of guns and limbers, for direct movement            to the front,           35 Tanks,          The traffic programme for the immediate future isTanks, Guns, Rolling stock, and Locomotives, all of which wouldhave otherwise necessarily to be carried in large sea-goingvessels.          All this material moves direct on to the Ferry and offon the French side without any handling and exactly as loadedfrom the works.          From Southampton were despatched:-          298 War Office Wagons (For use in France).          An Ambulance Train (For the U.S.A. Army),  and it  isworth noting that on one trip of this Ferry 104 Motor TransportLorries and vans for the American Forces were loaded^  It isprobable that this voyage constitutes a record in the movementof motor transport vehicles overseas, the previous recordquantity moved having been by an 8,000 ton ship from Portsmouthwhen approximately 95 Motor Transport Vehicles of all kindsformed the load.          In addition to the quantities of material carriedthere is a very great acceleration in time.          I think it has been clearly demonstrated under actualworking conditions that the use of these ships has been fullyjustified, by the continuity of the service, their largecarrying capacity of awkward cargoes, and their seaworthyconditions under stress of weather.
