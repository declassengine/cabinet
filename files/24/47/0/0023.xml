FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 3rd April, 1913.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department ?aring the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

TILLAGE DEFAULTERS.

The work of inspecting holdings is proceeding on the lines indicated in recent reports.

There is abundant evidence that, as was anticipated, visits from ? Department&apos;s land Inspectors - whose number was recently augmented - have resulted in occupiers bestirning themselves to plough up and to ? s?w with oats additional areas of their grass lands. Fortunately, the weather has proved favourable for tillage operations, and oven the break about the middle of the week under review proved advantageous as it facilitated the  preparation of the ground for s?wing.

The average daily number of cases dealt with by the Inspectors is about 400 and it is hoped that by this procedure the number of cases of default will be largely diminished. In many bad cases of non-compliance the Department are instructing tho? Inspectors to enter the holdings under powers conferred upon the Department by Regulation 2L. of the Defence of the Realm Act. Subsequent to entry, public auctions are held; and since the last weekly report was furnished a total area approximately 560 Acres has been let in conacre by the Department.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Eighty-six applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week.  The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year to date, under the Scheme,  amounts to  Â£23,222.

PROGRESS OF TILLAGE OPERATIONS.

Sh?wery weather towards the end of last week interfered to some extent with sewing operations, but facilitated the ploughing of lea land. It is reported generally that satisfactory progress was made during the week with the work of sewing and planting. In several counties tillage operations are said to be more forward than at the corresponding period during any recent year. It is reported from a number of counties that early sown wheat and oats crops are very promising.

3/4/18.


POTATO SPRAYING.

Circulars have been issued to traders throughout the country informing them of the arrangements made by the Department for the supply of knapsack spraying machines. Traders have also been notified as to prices at which copper sulphate and soda crystals for spraying purposes may be obtained.

ARTIFICIAL  MANURES.

Complaints continue to be received from farmers who are unable to procure the quantities of artificial manures which they require.

FLAX.

Most of the expected Canadian and Japanese fibre flax seed has now arrived in Ireland and is being rapidly distributed. About 5,000 bags of new Dutch seed and 3,000 bags of new Russian seed have also arrived. The latter seed, however, contains a large proportion of impurities and it is expected that the quantity suitable for sowing will amount to only 2,400 bags. A further quantity of 11,000 bags of new Dutch seed has been landed in England.

Proposals for the licensing of soutch-mills and the registration of scutchers are under the consideration of the Department.

Arrangements for the printing of the report of the Departmental Committee on Charges for Soutching Flax and the Disposal of Tow have been practically completed, and it is anticipated that the Report will be ready for issue in a short time.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 26th March to 1st April, inclusive 440 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding sows were received and 303 licences were issued. During the same period 144 applications for licences to export milch cows and 111 applications for licences to slaughter or  export heifers under the Maintenance of Live Stock (Ireland) (Temporary) order?, 1917, were received. Twenty applications for licences to laughter bulls or bullocks under the Maintenance of Live Stock Irelands. Order of 1918, and the Pig and Pig Products Prohibition of Experts) (Ireland) Order of 1918, 31 applications for licences for licences to export pigs were received and 47 licences were issued.
