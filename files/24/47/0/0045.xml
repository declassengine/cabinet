THE Chairman welcomed the representatives of the different Allied countries,and explained the circumstances in which the  Council had been created in accord-ance with the decisions of the Paris Conference of December 1917.     The minutes  of  the preliminary Conference of  representatives  of  the fourcountries at the Foreign Office on the 15th February, 1918, were read and  acceptedas correct, and the specific questions dealt with  in those minutes were discussed withthe following results:                               1. Name of Council.     The Council accepted the proposal that the name of the Council should  be &quot; TheAllied Maritime Transport Council.&quot;           2. I1 he statement of the Functions and Scope of the Council.    While not  dissenting from the description of the functions of the Council pro-posed at the Conference of the 15th February, as shown in the minutes  (appendixNo. 1, paragraph 4 (&amp;)), M.  Clementel suggested to the Council that it was undesir-able that any formal statement should be adopted in replacement of the resolutionsof the Paris Conference.  He proposed that those resolutions should remain the basisof the Council&apos;s work.  The  Council concurred in this view.    Sir Joseph Maclay said he wished to make it clear that he understood the state-ment in the Paris Conference decision that &quot; each nation shall manage  and supervisethe tonnage under its control &quot; as meaning the cc tonnage from time to time under itscontrol,&quot; and not as meaning that the present quantity or proportion  of tonnage inan Ally&apos;s service would be maintained under its control.  It was agreed that this wasthe correct interpretation.                                3. Press Notice.    At the  same  time the Council approved the  publication of the press notice(appendix No. 2) describing the functions of the Council.                       4.  Arrangements as to Chairman.    After  some discussion as to the  alternative  methods of electing a permanentchairman or  of  the chair rotating  between the representatives of  the differentcountries, the Council adopted the proposal of the Conference (appendix No. 1, para-graph 4 (c)), viz., that the senior Minister of the country in which a meeting of theCouncil was held should preside at that meeting.                       5. The Appointment of a Secretary.    The Council appointed Mr. J. A.  Salter as Secretary to the Council.  6. Provision of the Executive Machinery and Permanent  Staff of the Council.    The Council decided that  in accordance with the proposal of the Conference(appendix  No. 1, paragraph 4 (d)) the  permanent organisation should be m fourDivisions-American, French, Italian, and  British-the Secretary of the Councilbeino- the head of the British Division and responsible for convening and presidingover meetings of the heads of the other Divisions and for arranging with them for thepreparation of information, &amp;c, to be made upon identical lines.  It was decided thatthe four  Divisions meeting in this way should draw up  an agreed statement of the
  problems requiring to be settled by decisions of the Council itself, and should attempt  to suggest alternative decisions which would suffice to solve these problems  T.  ,  The above Slx items were the subject of proposals bv the Conference of the 15th  r ebruary.      The following items, which had  not been discussed at that  Conference  were also dealt with by the Council:       7. Consideration of Provisional Balance Sheet of Import Requirements and                      Carrying Power of Tonnage A callable.      Forms had been circulated (see appendix No. 3) showing in detail the import requirements of each of the Allied countries, and the tonnage under their control available to meet them.  The Chairman pointed  out  that these statements were at present incomplete.  No figures in a sufficiently final  form for inclusion were avail- able for  America, and the Italian  information was also incomplete.  Moreover, though the British figures allowed for a reduction already made in British require- ments of 4,000,000 tons as compared with 1917, a similar revision had not been made in  the  other  programmes,  and doubtless  further  examination would show some possibilities of reduction.  On the tonnage side he pointed out that no allowance had been made for the carrying power of any additional neutral  vessels (e.g., Dutch and Swedish) or interned vessels  (e.g.,  German vessels now interned in Chile).  For the moment the estimates could only be used to give the Council  a general indication of the scope of the deficit which they would have later to deal with, this deficit, subject to the qualifications mentioned above, being equivalent to a deficit of  10,000,000  tons of imports into the three European Allied countries from sources of an average dis- tance, or a  deficit  of   2.200,000 tons  deadweight tonnage continuously employed throughout the year.     M. Loueheur called attention to the fact that in  the tonnage statement vessels under 1,600 tons  had been excluded, and this gave a somewhat false  impression, particularly in  relation  to  the  carriage  of French  coal.  He  also pointed out that  considerable additional  information had  been  furnished since the  pre- paration of the forms, and it  would, perhaps, be possible to give the Council a closer idea of the actual  deficit. It was decided to refer these two questions to a committee of officials to report upon the following  day.  A  committee  was appointed accord- ingly, and their report is given in appendix 4.  They recommended in effect that the smaller tonnage should be included in the forms, but distinguished from the larger tonnage.  They also reported that it was not practicable to arrive at a closer estimate of the general deficit without several weeks&apos;  work, and recommended the Council to accept the present figure provisionally as the best estimate possible at  the time.  The Council accepted both recommendations, and instructed the Secretary to arrange for the forms to be prepared accordingly for the use of the Council at their next meeting.                     8.  Supply of Coal to Italy and France.    Lord Robert Cecil reported that the previous Conference of representatives of France, Italy, and Great Britain had left the question of the supply of coal to Italy in the following position.    It had been agreed that the supply of 600,000  tons of coal a month to Italy was the  absolute  minimum  necessary  to  meet her requirements.  It  had  also been agreed that  it was essential that the maximum proportion of this quantity should go in whole  or  in part bv  rail in  order to save the strain upon tonnage and the risk involved in the long sea passage from the United Kingdom to Italy. With this object,and  having regard  to   the probable  maximum transporting capacity by rail, thefollowing provisional programme had been recommended:     150,000 tons of British coal to go by long sea route  from the United ^vingdom to        Italy.    100,000 tons of British coal  to be shipped to Blaye, and to proceed thence either       &apos; by rail all the way or by rail to Marseilles or other South French port and        thence bv short sea route to Italy.    240,000 tons of French coal to be railed from French southern mines to  Italy or to       &apos; Marseilles or other French port for short sea shipment.    110 000 tons of British coal to be sent to Eochefort or the Gironde to be railed       1 thence through France to Italy or to South France for the short sea route.
     Of the total quantity of 450,000 tons proceeding under the above scheme in whole or m part by rail, it was contemplated that 270,000 tons would go by rail all the way to Italy, and that  180,000 tons would  be  shipped  from Marseilles or other South French ports.     The Council at once agreed      (a.)  That 600,000   tons  represented  the absolute minimum quantity it was            necessary to  send to Italy, and     (b.)  That the maximum quantity should be sent in whole or in part by rail, and            that the  quantity to be sent by long sea route should if possible not exceed            150,000 tons  allowed for in the above plan.     It was, however, pointed out that economy in tonnage would be effected, and a smaller strain on railway transport involved if (apart  from the 150,000 by long sea route   and the  100,000  via  Blaye) the whole of the  remaining 350,000&quot;tons were French coal, the vessels contemplated as  assignable for the conveyance of the  110.000 tons to Rochefort and the Gironde being used to compensate France for the supply of the extra quantity of  French coal.     With  agreement so  far  reached  the  Council were faced with  the  following problems:     (a.) Whether the railway  facilities  were, or could be made, sufficient to guar-           antee a supply of 350,000 tons of French coal in addition to 100,000 tons           of British coal via Blaye-270,000 tons to go by rail to Italy, and 180,000           tons to South France for short sea route.     (6.) What, if  any, arrangements  it was  necessary to  make to  increase the           importation of coal into France in order to replace 350,000 tons to be           supplied by her to Italy, and     (c.) How the tonnage was to be arranged  for              (i.) Shipment to Italy by long sea route;            (ii.)  Shipment to Blaye;           (iii.)  Short sea shipment  from South France to Italy; and           (iv.)  The importation of any extra coal into France.     With  regard to (a), i.e., the railway facilities, the Council asked  M. Claveille, Signor  Bianchi, and General  Nash to   consider  the question and report to them. Their report is attached (appendix 8).  It was understood from M. Claveille that the 450,000 tons could be transported in the immediate future in accordance  with the above  plan, but  that in view  of the  assignation  of  some 11,000 waggons to theAmerican army, the  probability of their  requirements increasing, and the fact  thatthe Americans had not so far been able to provide tonnage to import the considerablenumber of  waggons  awaiting shipment in America,  together with the  consequencesof the Italian campaign,  it would be necessary to supplement the number of waggonsin France by  special measures.  This need  not, and could not,  however, affect thequestion for the next month or two.     With regard to  (&amp;),  the Council decided that,  in view of the serious statementsby M. Loucheur and  M.  Clementel, supported by General Nash, as to the immediateimportance of maintaining the strategic coal reserves in France, the supply to Italy of350,000 tons of French coal in the ensuing month should be replaced by an equivalentimportation extended over a somewhat longer period.     With regard to (c), the question of the provision of tonnage, the Council directeda committee of shipping representatives of the different countries to  report as tothe method in which tonnage should be found to replace the 350,000 tons of Frenchcoal to be supplied to Italy.  The final report of this  Committee is attached (No. 5).Thev were generally to the effect that the British tonnage previously destined to carrythe 110,000 tons of coal to Rochefort and  the Gironde for Italy could be used to shipto nearer ports in France  in the 6 weeks, ending about the 1st May, about 150.000 tons.The shipment of the  remaining  200.000 tons in Atlantic vessels proceeding to Francewith a coal cargo before  going  across the Atlantic would, they estimated,  involve aloss of imports to the Allies of about 70.000 tons from the Lmited States.     It was decided that so far as possible any Dutch tonnage that could be  divertedinto Allied import service should be utilised to compensate for the loss involved inthe execution of the above programme.     The Italian representatives  pointed out  that  while  the above  programmecontemplated the supply  of 600,000 tons  a month no less than 350,000  tons of this
 was French coal, which was of lower calorific quality than the British, and they also stated that they must emphasise the fact that their real minimum requirements were not 600,000 but 690,000 tons a month.  In this connection General Dal&apos;Olio made a statement as to the Italian position, which is attached (appendix No. 7).     M. Loucheur presented a statement (attached, appendix No. 6) to the effect that France would be responsible for delivering 350,000 tons of the best  quality French coal, between the  15th  March and the 15th April, on the understanding that an equivalent quantity (with any adjustment necessary in view of difference in quality) should be supplied to France in replacement, and arranging for      (a.) A Franco-Italian Committee in Paris to watch the actual supply of French           coal day by day, and to inform the Secretary of the Council: and     (&amp;.) A  further meeting of experts in London before the 3rd April to prepare           proposals for the supplies after the 15th April next.     It was  also  agreed that the respective Governments should communicate  with their Ministers at Berne with  a view to securing the consent of the Swiss Govern- ment to the transit of a quantity not exceeding 90,000 tons a month via the Simplon on the specific guarantee that the whole of this quantity would be used for civilian purposes.     The suggestion was made  that  some reduction in the  quantity of tonnage esti- mated to be  required for lifting 180,000 tons a month from South  France to Italy (140,000 tons deadweight continually employed) could be effected if      [a.) Arrangements were made to secure the necessary berths, and rapid dispatch           at both the French and Italian receiving ports; and     (b.) If the coal could all be delivered at Genoa instead of being despatched, as it           was in some cases, to the southern ports (Naples and Leghorn,  &amp;c).    With regard to (a), the French and Italian  representatives undertook to makethe necessary arrangements.  With regard to (&amp;), it was suggested that South Italy could be compensated for a larger supply of the  French coal to North Italy by the allocation of a larger proportion of  the 150,000 tons going by the long sea route to the south instead of to the north.   Sighor Bianehi pointed out that the difficulty about this proposal was that  the coal proceeding from South France,  with  the excep- tion of the 100,000 tons going by Blaye,  would be French and not British coal, and itwas essential that North Italy should have a large proportion of British coal for ser-vices for which French coal was not  suitable.  He promised, however, to investigatethe question further.    It was agreed that it was essential that the French coal supply to Italy should beof the  best possible quality, and also that  improvement should be made if possible in the  quality of coal supplied by Great Britain  to  France, as  it was clearly desir-able that, so far as possible, coal of inferior quality should be consumed in localitiesnear its source of production, and that the  coal requiring to be transported, whetherby sea or rail, should have the maximum  calorific value for the bulk and weight trans-ported.                            Summary of Decisions.    The Council  decided that the following programme should be put into effect:     (a.)  France undertakes to  supply 350,000  tons  of  French  coal to Italy in the          month from the 15th March to the 15th April.    (6.)  The Allies to  ship 350.000 tons of British coal to France (mainly Dunkirk          and Rouen) in vessels not at the time in the French coal trade, and as          nearly as possible  within  six  weeks of the 15th March.    (c.)  The French coal supply to be of a  quality equal to that of the British coal,          an adjustment, whether by way  of an increase in the quantity of French          coal supplied or a reduction in the compensating coal, to be made to the          extent to which it proved inferior.    (d.)  So far as possible the  compensating coal so to be supplied to France to be          shipped in small vessels or other vessels not in the Atlantic import service.          and Great Britain to endeavour to ship  150,000 tons in tonnage of this          kind.  The remainder to be supplied bv the diversion of large vessels before          proceeding across the Atlantic, vessels being chosen from among those in          the service of the different Allies.      [341]                                                            C
      (e.) Ihe above arrangement was conditional upon Dutch tonnage in American            ports  being  quickly available  to compensate for the loss of Atlantic            imports  through diversion, and a recommendation  to be made to the            Supreme War Council that half  the Dutch tonnage in those ports should            be allotted to meet Allied cereals  (see No. 10 (b)).      (/.) The permanent organisation  of the Council to work out a co-operative            Allied plan  for the supply of the necessary tonnage for the shipment of            the other coal to Italy, viz.,  from the United Kingdom  to Italy, United            Kingdom to Blaye, and from South France to Italy, the  arrangements as            regards the  first two routes being as before the  primary responsibility            of Great Britain and Italy, but the other Allies co-operating particularly            in regard to the third route.      (g.) A committee to be composed of representatives of the  Italian Government,            of  the  French  Ministry of  Public  Works and the French Ministry            of Munitions to be appointed and be responsible  for watching at Paris            the actual  expedition of coal  to  Italy  day by  day, and to keep the            Secretary of the Council informed of the quantities  actually despatched.      (h.) A meeting of officials representing  the four countries to be held  in London            before the 3rd April next, to prepare a programme for the supply of coal            after the 15th April.      (?&quot;.) A communication to be made to the Swiss Government as to the  use of the            Simplon route (see above).      The further consideration of the French coal supply (after the 15th April)  was to take into account further information which was being obtained as to the exact extent of consumption and requirements, with due regard to the possible  economies mentioned  by General  Nash, viz., better working  of the  vessels in the  summer, decreased summer civilian consumption, increase  in French production (which M. Loucheur  stated  might  possibly be  raised  by 2,000 3,000  tons a day), and  any advantage that might be received by an improvement  in the quality of the British coal shipped to France, and, on the other hand, to any possible effects of a German offensive.                               9. Dutch Tonnage. (a.) Negotiations for the Acquisition of Dutch Tonnage.     The Chairman outlined the negotiations up to date with reference to the acqui- sition of surplus  Dutch  tonnage, amounting to  about 800,000 tons deadweight. He explained that the modus vivendi, which aimed at employing the 4/500,000 tons deadweight lying  idle in American  ports pending settlement of negotiations,  had broken down/owmg to pressure exercised by the Germans which made  it impossible for the Dutch to send out from Holland a ship for each  ship  which arrived carrying cargo for  the Belgian Relief  from America to Holland.  The United States  had apparently contemplated treating this as a breach of the modus vicendi, and a ground for requisitioning the Dutch tonnage without  further  negotiations.   The British Government, however, felt some hesitation about this action, as no time limit had been made within which the Dutch were bound to reply to the main agreement, and it was for various reasons undesirable to precipitate a quarrel with the Dutch. It was, at the same time, necessary to come to an immediate decision, because it was still open to the Dutch to accept the agreement proposed to them on the  4th January, which included a  provision that  the vessels  should  be  kept out of the war zone.  At that date it would have been  possible to substitute the  Dutch tonnage handed  over for other tonnage now being used outside the danger zone, but that was a lengthy process, and the need for obtaining Dutch tonnage was now urgent.   He stated that in these cir- cumstances the British Government,  after consultation  with representatives of the different Allies, had made a communication through their Minister  at The Hagueto the following effect (appendix No. 10):     (1 )  The  British Government would be prepared  to recommend to the Allies          that if the Dutch Government would agree  to allow  their vessels to  be          used immediately without restrictions in the danger zone, the Allies will          undertake at the end of the war to replace any Dutch vessel lost by war          risk in the danger zone as now determined.    (2 )  The  Allies would undertake before the 15th April to  place 50,000 tons  of          wheat at the  disposal of the Dutch  Government  in the  United States
            ports, and  another  50,000 tons later on  at a South American Atlantic            port.                An answer being requested from the Dutch Government by the 18th            March.     The representatives of the different countries expressed their Governments&apos; full approval of this action.     M.  Clementel then raised the question as to the action  to be taken if the Dutch Government were unwilling to  come to  an agreement, and the Allied  Governments had. therefore,  to  proceed to requisition.  He pointed  out  that they would very likely be forced to adopt this attitude through  German pressure, and personally he was strongly of opinion that the terms conceded in that event should be substantiallv as generous as if the agreement proposed had been effected, in  view, particularly, of the necessity of safeguarding the feeding of the Belgian and French populations in Belgium and Northern France.     The Council generally agreed in this view.  Mr. Stevens suggested that it was, perhaps, important in order to mitigate the effect  of the  public announcement of requisitioning, to announce publicly at the same time the exact terms of compensation the Allies were according.   It was felt, however, that there would be an advantage in retaining  some power to  bargain  as to the exact terms of compensation (e.g., as between the alternative of compensation  in money and replacement in actual ships in the event of war losses) as part of any blockade negotiations that might be proceed- ing.  It was agreed that each Government should consult its Minister at The Hague as to the probable importance of making a public announcement in specific terms at the moment of requisition, and that subject to any advice that might be so received the exact terms of compensation should be left to  be settled by the blockade authorities of the different  Governments. (b.)  Allocation  of Dutch Tonnage.     The Council discussed the  question of the  immediate  allocation of the Dutch vessels  when acquired, particularly those now  in American  ports, and, therefore, immediately available for loading Allied cereals.    Mr. Stevens  pointed  out  that the American military programme for 1918, recently  adopted by the Supreme War Council,  and  the requirements for necessary imports into America during 1918, wrould take all American tonnage now available, including any share America might obtain of Dutch  and other  neutral tonnage, and also including new construction, at least  up to the 1st July.  He further stated that the  estimate of  necessary  imports  for  1918  had  been   greatly  reduced  as compared with  1917.  M.  Clementel  said he  wished to express M. Clemenceau&apos;s very strong  opinion  as  to the extreme  importance of  not  interfering  with thetransport of  the further  American trcops decided upon by the Supreme War Council.  After some discussion it was decided  to recommend to the Supreme War Council that in view of the very serious deficit of Allied carrying power in relation to Allied requirements, and with particular reference to the loss of American imports which must result from the diversion of Atlantic vessels to France  under  the pro- gramme arranged above, at least half of  the Dutch tonnage  now in American portsshould be allotted at  once for one vovage for Allied cereals (see appendix No. 9). 10. Relation of Council and  its Staff to the carious  Executives, and their authority   with regard to Oil Fuel and Tank Tonnage and Meat and Refrigerated Tonnage.     The Italian representatives raised the question of whether refrigerator and tank tonnage came within the scope of the Council&apos;s functions.     The Council agreed that these special types of tonnage were as much within the scope of their authority as other tonnage, and that it was as much their duty, there- fore, to consider import programmes of meat and oil as of other commodities.     The exact way in which  they would exercise their authority needed special con- sideration in conjunction with the  Executives and Departments  now dealing with these commodities.   It was recognised that oil fuel and meat presented certain special features  and that  the scope and functions  of the executives or other bodies dealing with various classes of imports, and  their relation to the Council and its staff, must vary to some extent with the  particular circumstances of each class of importations.     The Secretary was instructed to prepare, in conjunction with the heads  of theseveral Divisions of the permanent  organisation, a comprehensive report as  to the
relations of the Council and its staff to the several Executives for consideration bythe Council at its next meeting.   This report  was to be written after consultationwith representatives of the various Executives, and  of the Departments concernedwith commodities for which Executives are not yet in existence, and to include pro-posals both  as to the division of  work between the staff of the Council and theExecutives, and as to steps, if any, requiring to be taken to secure the establishmentof new executives or alterations in the functions of existing ones.    The French representatives  had given notice that they  wished to discuss thegeneral question of the relation of the Council to the Executives, but M. Clementeiannounced that he would prefer that the discussion of this subject should be deferredtill the next session of the Council.                      11. Shipbuilding in Allied Countries.    M. Loucheur made a  suggestion as to the utilisation in French shipyards of anvsurplus steel, which was not being  immediately used  for either British or Americanshipbuilding,  in order to  increase  the  total Allied output of  tonnage.  Alliedco-operation as regards the actual building was also suggested.    Sir Alan Anderson stated that there was at present no probability of any suchsurplus as regards the British shipbuilding programme, but machinery was beingset up in Paris which would enable such a  suggestion to be carried out should it provepossible later on.  It  was suggested that skilled French and Italian labour might betransferred  to United  Kingdom shipyards.   This,  however,  was  consideredby Signor Orlando to be impracticable.    The position appeared to be that, while there were obvious  advantages in  dis-tributing the  actual  shipbuilding as much as possible between the four Allies, tolessen the danger of delay from strikes, accident, &amp;o, the difficulties of tonnage anddanger from  submarines  made  it advisable to  move shipbuilding materials, moreparticularly steel, as little as possible.    It was understood that a Committee of the Naval Council was dealing with thewhole question of supplies and their proper allocation, and it was decided to leavethe whole matter to them.                            12.  War Risk Insurance.    M. Loucheur made a suggestion that the very high cost of freight and insurancemight be reduced if  the  Governments concerned could jointly  undertake the  warinsurance risks. Such an arrangement would, moreover, benefit the exchange.    The matter was referred to a Committee, the sense of their report (see appendix11) was that the matter, being almost a purely  financial one, it should be referred tothe Inter-Allied Finance Council, and if they approved it should be investigated bva small Allied technical Committee.                             !                            i       13. Agreement as  to Chartering and Allocation of Neutral  Vessels.    The Chairman reported that the Committee,  considering the question of  thefuture allocation of neutral tonnage, had arrived at  a  complete agreement, so thaithere was no need to trouble the Council with this question.    The  arrangement  arrived  at is embodied  in the  Agreement  of the  13thMarch,  printed in apoendix 12.  The French  and Italian representatives acceptedthe Agreement in the form shown, and it was arranged that its terms should be dis-cussed with the American representatives with  a view to its acceptance by them sub-jectto certain modifications (see para. 1 of Agreement).                           14.  Date of Next Meeting.    It was decided that the next meeting  of the Council would probably be in abouta month or five weeks&apos; time, and that the main duty of the Secretariat before thatdate would be to examine the import programmes in  view  of the drastic reductionsnecessitated by the tonnage deficit.
Appendix No.  1.Minutes^ of Meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 15th February, 1918, in connec-       tion with  the  establishment  of the  Inter-Allied  Shipping  Organisation       decided upon at the Paris Conference of December 1917.    1. A Conference of representatives of France, Italy, the  United  States  ofAmerica, and Great Britain met at the Foreign Office on the 15th Februarv  1918 atthe invitation of Lord Robert Cecil, to consider the establishment of the Inter-AlliedShipping Organisation  decided upon at the Paris Conference in December 1917.    There were present:          M. de Fleuriau,   1 -    2. Lord  Robert Cecil, who took  the chair, explained  that  he had invited theConference in order to arrange for the first meeting of the  new Council and for thediscussion of certain  preliminary questions which it was  desirable to agree uponbefore the Council  itself met, and in particular to make provisional arrangementsfor the staff required  in connection with the work  of the Council.    3. Signor Crespi  raised the preliminary question as to the meaning and effect ofa resolution adopted by the Supreme War Council since the Paris Conference as tothe establishment of a Committee to  co-ordinate tonnage  and  supplies.   It was,however, considered that this resolution should not be interpreted in such a way asto be inconsistent with the establishment of a new Council in the form contemplatedby the Paris Conference.    4. The following questions were  considered, and provisional decisions arrivedat.(a.) The Adoption of the Name of the New  Organisation.    The name  &quot; Allied Maritime Transport  Council &quot; was  decided   upon.   Mr.Crosby stated that  he must point out that the United States of America were nottechnically an Ally, and he desired this remark to be recorded in the minutes.   Heconcurred, however, in the adoption of the name for the Council.(b.) Functions and Scope.    The functions  of the new  Council and the scope of its duties were discussed.Mr. Crosby raised a preliminary question as to the  relation  between the new Counciland the one over which he presided as to the allocation of finance.   He pointed outthat the two  limiting factors to imports were tonnage and finance, and that  unlesssatisfactory co-ordination was effected between the two bodies there was some dangerthat one might deal with programmes of imports  without the knowledge that theother  might have been dealing with the  same programmes or  be  about to do so in aconflicting manner.    It was pointed out that tonnage was perhaps more likely to bethe more serious and more  absolute limiting factor, but it was realised that closerelations between the two bodies would be essential.   This  would be effected partlythrough the different Executive Committees and partly by the secretaries of the twobodies keeping in close touch.    It was agreed to recommend the following to the Council as a  convenient descrip-tion  of  their  functions  and  duties,  though, as  M. de Fleuriau pointed out, thewording  of the report of the Paris Conference must, in case of doubt, remain  asthe Binding document at least until the meeting of the Council itself :-      The purpose of tht Allied Maritime Transport Council is to watch overthe general conduct of Allied transport, and while leaving each nation respon-[341]D
sible for the management and supervision of the tonnage under its own controlto secure the necessary exchange of information and co-ordination in policy andeffort on the part of the four Governments  of France, Italy, the United  Statesof America, and Great Britain in adjusting their programmes of  imports tothe carrying  capacity of  the available tonnage (having regard  to naval  andmilita^ requirements), and  in  making the  most  advantageous allocation anddisposition of the tonnage under their control in  accordance with the urgencyof war needs.    :t For this purpose the Council will obtain through its permanent staff theprogrammes of  import requirements drawn up by the Inter-Allied ExecutiveCommittees which  are established or to be  established on  the model of theWheat Executive (with such modifications as may be necessary in the  differentcases) for each of the main classes of essential imports, and take these  as thebasis.  It will also  be responsible for obtaining through its permanent staff thefullest information as to  the tonnage available to the respective  Governments,for examining the imports programmes furnished  by the Executives  in relationto the  carrying  power of the available tonnage, for ascertaining the extent ofany deficit, and for considering the  means whereby such a deficit may be  met,whether by a  further  reduction in the programmes of imports or by the acquisi-tion, if practicable, of further  tonnage  for importing work.  If the Councilagrees that reductions in any of the different  programmes of imports to a definedextent  are  necessary,  the Ministers  will  so  report to their  respective  Govern-ments,  with a view to secure that  the necessary decisions and action are takenin their respective  countries  and the necessary modifications are  made  in theprogrammes produced by the several Inter-Allied  Executive Committees.&quot;(c.) Arrangements as to a Chairman.  &apos;    It was agreed that the most convenient arrangement would be the usual one thatthe senior Minister of the country in which a meeting of the Council was held shouldpreside at that meeting, no permanent  chairman being appointed.(d.) The provision of the necessary Executive Machinery and such Staff  as  the       Council may require, and the appointment of a Secretary.    It was agreed that it  would probably be most convenient  for  the  permanentorganisation  to be in four sections French, Italian, American,  and British-andthat the Secretary of the Council  should be the head of one of these sections, andshould be responsible for convening the heads of the other sections, arranging withthem  for the preparation of information to be made upon identical lines: and thatthe four sections meeting in this way should  draw up an agreed statement of  theproblem requiring to be&quot; settled by the  decisions  of the  Council  itself, and shouldattempt to suggest alternative decisions which would suffice to solve that problem.    It was pointed out that this arrangement, while doubtless requiring the existingorganisations of the different countries to be strengthened in certain  cases by  theaddition of extra staff,  would reduce such additional appointments to the smallestdimensions, and would  avoid the establishment of a large new organisation dupli-cating and overlapping with those  which already  exist,    Mr. J. A. Salter, on the proposal of M. de Fleuriau, was asked to undertake  theduties of  secretary, this arrangement being provisional and subject to  confirmationby the Council at&apos;its&apos; first meeting.(e.) Printed Forms for Preliminary Work.    The printed forms prepared for the preliminary work necessary to present theproblem requiring to be dealt with bv the Council were circulated.   It was agreed toleave these forms and the presentment of the information upon them to the Secretaryin conjunction with the heads of the Allied sections forming the permanent orgamsa-tion.(f.) Secretary to Prepare Draft.    It was decided that the Secretary should draft an announcement for publicationoutlining the functions of the Council to submit to the first meeting of the Council.
This announcement should follow generally the form of the announcement made inconnection with the establishment of the Naval Allied Council.(g.) The Appointment of Ministers on the Council.    Signor Crespi announced that he understood that he himself and Signor Bianchiwould be the Italian Ministers, and Mr. Crosby announced that Mr. Stevens had beendesignated by the American Government as their&apos; representative.   As France hadalready designated M. Clementel and  M. Loucheur,  and Great Britain Lord RobertCecil and Sir Joseph Maclay, this completed the representation upon the Council.(h.) Date of the next  Meeting.    It was decided that the first meeting of the  Council itself should be convenedfor the nearest convenient date to the  1st March.Appendix No. 2.                               PRESS  NOTICE.                       Allied Maritime  Transport Council.     The  Foreign  Office  and  the  Ministry of  Shipping  make  the  followingannouncement:      At the Paris Conference of December last it was decided to create an AlliedMaritime Transport Council, consisting of two Ministers each of France, Italy, andGreat Britain and a representative of the United States of America, to supervisethe general conduct of Allied maritime transport.     Since this decision was reached the  necessary preparatory work has been pro-ceeding,  and the following  representatives, appointed by their  respective Groyern-ments, have now met  for the first formal  meetings of the  Council, which commencedat Lancaster House, London, on the 11th March, and are still proceeding:          France              M. Clementel, Minister of Commerce and Industry.             M. Loucheur, Minister of Munitions.         Italy              *Signor Crespi, Minister of Supplies.             *The  On. Salvatore  Orlando, Commissioner for Mercantile Marine                 Construction.         United  States of America              The Hon. Raymond B. Stevens,  Vice-Chairman of the United States                 Shipping  Board.         Great Britain              Rt. Hon. Lord Robert Cecil, K.C., M.P., Under-Secretary of State for                 Foreign Affairs (Chairman).             Rt, Hon. Sir Joseph P. Maclay, Bart.. Shipping Controller.                     Secretary  to the Council: Mr. J. A. Salter.                         Address: Lancaster House. London, S.W. 1.     The  following representatives were also in attendance:          Accompanying the French Delegates              M.  Claveille, Minister of Public Works;             M.  Vilgrain, Under-Secretary of State for Supplies:             and Messieurs Bijard, Bletry, Charpentier, Kahn, Monnet.  Serruys,                 and Ulrich.   * These representatives attended at  the first meeting.  The formal appointments will be announcedlater.
         Accompanying the Italian Delegates              Signor Bianchi, Minister of Transport;             General DalFQlio, Minister of Munitions;             Prince Borghese, Italian Embassy;             and   Professor  Attolico,  C.B.;  M.   Beiino;   Colonel  Campolmi:                 Lieutenant Farina; and Engineer Mosca.         Accompanying the American Delegate              Messrs. G. Rublee, L. H. Shearman, D. P. Morrow, J. D. Greene, J. A.                 Field, L. H.  Dow, and  G.  D. Dutton,  and Commanders L. B                 McBride U.S.N.,  and Paul Foiey, U.S.N.     The purpose of the Council is to supervise the general conduct of Allied trans-port, in order to obtain the most effective use of tonnage for the prosecution of thewar, while leaving each nation responsible for the management of the tonnage underits own control.     With this object the Council will secure the necessary exchange of information,and will co-ordinate the policy and action of the four  Governments of France, Italy,United States of America, and Great Britain, in adjusting  their programmes ofimports to the carrying capacity of the available Allied tonnage (having regard tonaval and military  requirements), and in making the most advantageous allocationand disposition of such tonnage  in accordance with the urgency of war needs.     The Council will have at its service a permanent organisation consisting of foursections (French, Italian,  American, and British): the head of the British  Sectionbeing Secretary to the Council.  The Council will obtain through its permanent staffthe programmes of  import requirements for each of  the  main classes of essentialimports,  and full statements as  to the tonnage available to the respective  Govern-ments.  It will examine the import programmes in relation to the carrying power ofthe available tonnage in order to ascertain the extent of any deficit, and will considerthe means whereby  such a deficit may be  met, whether by a reduction in the importprogrammes, by the acquisition, if  practicable, of further tonnage for  importingwork, or by the more economical and co-operative use of the tonnage already available.    The Members of the Council will report to their respective Governments, with aview to securing that the decisions and action required to give effect to any recom-mendations made by the Council are taken in their respective countries.Appendix No. 3.                   Statistical Forms Circulated to the Council.    Forms 1 and 2 were distributed to the heads of the four national sections;Forms 3 to 6 were circulated to all representatives attending the Council meetings.Form 6 alone is now reproduced, but short notes regarding the other forms are givenbelow :     Form 1. Detailed statement  of actual imports  into France, Italy, and  GreatBritain respectively during 1917 compared with the present  programmes for 1918.    Form 2. Summarising the statistics in Form  1 under groups  of  supplyingcountries, each group consisting of countries about equidistant from the importingcountries.    Form 3. Setting out the aggregate imports to be made during 1918 from eachgroup of countries, and calculating the amount of tonnage required.    Form 4.-Showing the allocation of the tonnage in the  service of France,  Italy,and Great Britain respectively as on the 1st January, 1918.    Form 5. Ditto for the mean  tonnage  expected to be available for the importwork of each country during 1918, due allowance having been made for expected newbuilding on the one hand and losses  by enemy and ether action on the other hand.
     FormG (reproduced below). Setting out in the form of a balance-sheet the ton-nage required for the present import programmes (see Form 3), as against the meantonnage available during the year  (see Form 6),  and  thence estimating the tonnagedeficit,                        ALLIED MARITIME  TRANSPORT  COUNCIL               FORM fi.STATEMENT showing Tonnage Required and Tonnage Available for Import, Work during 1918.Tonnage Required, as shown by Form o.

The Italian tonnage particulars  have not yet been presented ina form which enables them to be set out on Forms 4 and 5, and it  has been thought better to await thefurther information from IrJaly before attempting to do this, and meanwhile to include both Italian and Frenchtonnage with the estimate of the amount of importing work done for the  European Allies  by vessels notincluded above see (5).  A comprehensive estimate of the three items included in (b) has been made on thebasis of the information at present available to the Ministry of Shipping.  It requires further examination,but the total deficit may be taken as approximately correct.    NOTE. -The general effect of the above statement is that the tonnage estimated as available for theservice of the three European Allies (excluding any neutral or interned tonnage idle at the beginning of theyear, which  may be brought into employment, and any assistance  from America) was 2,200,000  tons d.w.less than  the amount required  to meet  the three countries&apos; stated import requirements, and  that this isequivalent to a shortage of 10,000,000 tons on these requirements.  While this estimate maybe  taken asapproximately correct for the total defifit, the distribution of the deficit between  the three countries asshown above must be taken as quite provisional, and of course the  import programmes on which the deficitis calculated are subject to considerable revision.Appendix  No.  4.Meeting  on  Monday, March  11,  1918, of Committee appointed by the Allied  Maritime  Transport  Council  to  consider  form of presentment  of Allied                         Tonnage available and required.                                      Present:                      M. Monnet,          J                      M. Revillon,           I                      Captain Bletry.       \: France.

Great Britain.                      Mr. Browett,     The Committee agreed      1.  That the statements of &quot; tonnage required &quot;  in the various groups, as shownon Form 3, should,  where necessary, be amplified to show the total tonnage required,       [341]                                   m                               E
whether ocean-going or not, so that the Council might have before them a tonnagestatement showing the total tonnage of all sizes required to convey the imports to thevarious countries.    2. That as a result of paragraph 1,  the &quot;tonnage available &quot; on the other sideof the account will require to include for each country a statement of the vessels ofless than 1,600 gross tonnage and their employment.    3. That pending a further investigation of the tonnage allowance to be made inthe case of each  country  in respect  of the importing work performed  by tonnageneither owned nor controlled by that country, it is not possible to present the tonnageproblem to the Council in  a more detailed manner than is done on Form  6, and thatwhile certain modifications may be found to be necessary when the examination ofthe further French tonnage figures is finished, and the Italian  and  United Statestonnage figures are available in such forms as to enable them to be embodied in thestatements, the tonnage deficit of 2,200,000 tons deadweight, as estimated by thestatisticians of the British Ministry of Shipping, may be taken by the Council asrepresenting  approximately  the deficit of the three Allies France,  Italy, and theUnited Kingdom this tonnage deficit, representing a deficit of about 10,000,000 tonsof imports, as compared with the stated requirements of the three countries for 1918.    4. That while it may&apos;be possible to amend the British tonnage  particulars inaccordance with the decision in paragraph 1 in time for consideration at the presentsession of the Council,  it will not be  practicable to present the general tonnage pro-blem  in  a more  complete form on  the  present occasion, as the compilation of thevarious tonnage figures, and more particularly the investigation and agreement ofthe allowances to be made for  importing  work done by outside tonnage will requireseveral weeks&apos; work. As stated above, however, the final tonnage deficit, as shown onForm 6, may be taken by the Council as representing approximately the position withwhich the three Allies France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are faced in theyear 1918.Appendix No.  5.              ALLIED  MARITIME TRANSPORT  COUNCIL.    Meeting of Committee appointed by  Council and held at British Ministry                      of Shipping on March 13,  at  10  A.M.    The Committee considered the following memorandum referred to them by theCouncil:         &quot; The Council had before them this afternoon the report of the Committee    appointed to consider at what cost 150,000 tons  deadweight could be found to    give supplementary coal to France.         &quot;They  desired the Committee to reassemble with  a view to  considering    at what cost to other services a single supplementary supply of 350,000 tons of    coal could be  shipped to  France (as far as  possible to  Dunkirk and  Rouen)    within some such period as 6 weeks  from the present time; and, alternatively,    at what lower  cost this quantity could be shipped over a somewhat longer period.         &quot; The suggestion was made that the tonnage required for  the Marseilles-    Italy shipments might be somewhat  reduced if all the coal went to  Genoa and    none to Naples and southern ports, this being rendered possible by the vessels    which are proceeding via  Gibraltar being sent to Naples instead of  Genoa,   It    was pointed out by Signor Crespi that it was essential that North Italy should    have a certain proportion of English coal (which  might exceed the quantity    being sent through Blaye).  This side of the question will be examined on the    arrival of Signor Bianchi, but, meantime, the Committee should have the point    in mind.                                                                .         &quot; M.  Loucheur stated that in order to facilitate the use of trans-Atlantic    vessels to  take coal to France before  proceeding across the Atlantic,  the French    Government would be prepared to make a sacrifice temporarily on the shipments    of  French steel from America.
    &quot; The Council also decided, if practicable, to have a list of the vessels inthe country (whether British. Allied,  or  neutral) which could be  diverted ifnecessary in the above manner. *&apos;     It was agreed:      1. That if  the  whole of the  350,000 tons of coal were shipped to France bytrans-Atlantic tonnage, this would mean a  delay of about 3 weeks to 350,000 tonsdeadweight of tonnage, which, in turn, would mean the loss (on the basis of a roundvoyage of about 75 days to the  Northern Range) of about 110,000 tons of importsfrom North America.  In other words, for every 3 tons of coal shipped to France bytrans-Atlantic tonnage in this way, there would be a loss of 1 ton of imports fromthe States to the Allies.     It must be remembered, however, that this numerical loss does not in any wayrepresent the  whole of the  cost  to the Allies, inasmuch  as diversions on this scalewould entail very serious upsets to import programmes, and would  inevitably involvesuch serious dislocation as to mean even greater losses of imports.     2. The United Kingdom representatives stated that, as a result of very drasticcombing  out of the coasting trade, it  was hoped that tonnage would be available tocarry to  France during the next  6  weeks, to  the 1st May, a supplementary supply of150,000 tons of coal.  This tonnage was the tonnage intended to carry 110,000 tonsof coal to Rochefort and Gironde for Italy under the previous scheme, and it must beunderstood that the greater part of it can only be withdrawn temporarily from itsown trades.     This would leave 200.000 tons (i.e., 350,000 less  150.000) to complete the supple-mentary  supply, and this would, on the basis indicated in paragraph 1, entail a lossof imports to the Allies of 70,000 tons from North America.  It is for the Council todecide (1) whether this loss of imports can be faced, and (2), if so. in what propor-tions it should be borne by each country.     If it were practicable to  maintain the above small tonnage  in the French coaltrade until the 1st  June, it is estimated that it would carry a further 125.000 tons, or275,000 tons altogether.     3. Lists of ocean-going vessels (a) in  the United Kingdom  ports, and (&amp;) inFrench  ports  are now being prepared, and as soon as they are available  will beexamined to see which are the most suitable vessels to carry the balance of the supple-mentary  supply of coal to France.     4. It is understood that there is  a certain amount of tonnage trading betweenFrance and the United Kingdom which is in the general  cargo trade outside  specialGovernment requirements, and may be capable to some extent of being diverted tothe carriage of coal.   The United Kingdom representatives  undertook  to examinethis question at once.     The  Italian Government representatives wished it  to be clearly understood thatnotwithstanding any diversions  of tonnage  to effect this supplementary supply ofcoal to France, there should be no question that the supply of coal to Italy  shouldreach the agreed figure of 600,000 tons of coal in the month  (that is including the350,000 tons of French coal).The Committee reassembled accordingly.Present:Mr. Shearman.

     Le  necessaire sera  fait  pour fournir a la France 350,000 tonnes de charbonanglais,  en supplement des importations qui sont effectuees avec ies moyens a  sa dis-position (y compris fournitures de FAmiraute).     Cette fourniture  devrait etre progressive et en principe terminee le  15 avril,avec possibilite dim retard de dix a qumze jours pour Fachevement de la fourniture&apos;     Une livraison de  350,000 tonnes de charbon sera faite par la France  a 1&apos;Italie,echelonnee du 15 mars au 15 avril.     Le  charbon  proviendra des mines francaises  du Sud-Est  et sera de qualiteequivalente a celle du charbon anglais; jsinon, il y aura lieu a compensation.   II estde  plus  convenu que si une  partie  du charbon anglais est fournie  aux ports deBordeaux ou de Roehefort, les plus grands efforts seront  fails par le Gouvernementfrancais pour que le  charbon  anglais  ainsi fourni soit  transporte directement enItalie, sans pouvoir prendre, toutefois, d*engagement formel a ce sujet,  II va sansdire que les 100,000 tonnes environ de charbon qui sont actuellement transporters deBlaye vers VItalie continueront a suivre cette voie.    Une reunion des  experts des quatre nations aura lieu a Londres avant le 3 avrilprochain pour arreter les dispositions a appliquer a partir du 15  avril  pour assurerla fourniture de charbon a 1&apos;Italie  jusqu&apos;au 30 juin prochain.    Un  comite compose d&apos;un represent ant italien, d&apos;un representant du Mini st eredes Travaux  publics  francais  et d&apos;un representant du  Ministere de l&apos;Armementfrancais  suivra a Paris chaque jour les expeditions sur 1&apos;Italie  et tiendra au courantle Secretariat du Conseil allie des Transports maritimes.                                                  (Sign6)       LOUCHEUR.    14 mars, 1918.    Pour realiser le probleme italien, il faut     1. Assurer  la fourniture  directe   de  150,000  tonnes par mois de la Grande-           Bretagne a FItalic.    2. Mettre 150,000 tonnes de bateaux en plus sur le trafic Angleterre Rouen.    3. Mettre des wagons et des  locomotives sur les transports  charbons  Italie            France (M. Claveille avec M. Bianchi).    4. Mieux employer le tonnage en ne transportant  que  des charbons de  premiere           qualite.Appendix No.  7.The Italian Minister of Transport wishes to make the following declaration:-1. He prefers that the basis of the agreement for the supply of coal to Italy in      a minimum quantity of 600,000 tons monthly to be increased as soon as      possible to 690,000, should provide  for  the  supply of 240,000 tons of      French coal and 360,000 tons of English coal, as, for the needs of Italy,      the English coal is more suitable than the  French coal.2. He declares that  the Italian State Railways will do  every effort in view of      supplying the help of locomotives asked by France, to enable this country      to carry through France the English coal  bound for Italy, and will also      take  the necessarv steps to  comply with  the  request of M. Claveille,      French Minister of Transport, for  the exchange of railway trucks.3. Should the coal  supplied  by the French mines not  prove to  give the same      calories as the British  coal,  it will suit  that the 240,000 tons of French      coal  will only correspond  to 200,000  tons, and,  therefore,  instead  of      600,000 tons of coal Italy would only get an equivalent of 560,000 tons.4. That  the  programme so  reduced is  still subject to heavy reductions by      inevitable difficulties of transport overland, through railway obstructions,      and military transports.                                         .5. That it is necessary for the above reasons to obtain passage through Switzer-      land of supplementary coal trains.Appendix No. 6.
     6. That on the basis of 600,000 tons, which by difference of quality might even           be reduced to 540,000 tons, it is utterly impossible for  Italy to feed her           war industries and her already reduced- railway system, and  would, in           effect, leave Italy in a dangerous situation..     The minimum quantity of British coal to be sent to Italy by the direct sea routemust, therefore, be increased to 240,000 tons.     March  14, 1918.Appendix No. 8. Accord anglo-franco-itaUen au sujet des transports de charbons a faire par voie de                       fer en France a destination de 1&apos;Italic     M. Claveille, Ministre des Travaux publics de France, expose tout dabord que le  Gouvernement francais, se rendant compte  des difficultes considerables que ren- contre lTtalie pour ses approvisionnements de combustible, est  daccord  avec  le Gouvernement britannique pour remedier aussi completement  que  possible  a cette situation, et dans ce but il est decide a faire  transiter par la  France  une  partie notable de ce charbon, malgre la gene qui en resultera pour ses transports interieurs.     M. Claveille rappelle qu&apos;il a deja indique la possibilite de faire  transiter par la France 15,000 tonnes par jour, dont 9,000 tonnes seraient envoyees en chemin de fer en Italie, via Modane et Ventimille, et 6,000 tonnes seraient dirigees  vers les ports de la Mediterranee (Marseille,  Port-au-Bouc, Bone.  St. Louis-au-Rlione. Cette et la Nouvelle) pour etre transporte ensuite  aux ports italiens par cabotage.     II sagit de se procurer le materiel roulant necessaire.     A cet egard, M. Claveille fit observer  quil etait intervenu  le 10 Janvier, 1918, une entente ayant fait fob jet de la note ci-apres :           &apos;: En reponse a la demande de materiel roulant qui a  ete adressee j)ar M.     Berini au General Henderson, il fait remarquer qua la date  du le&apos; Janvier, 1918,     la balance entre les wagons francais se trouvant en Italie et les wagons italiens en     France s&apos;etablissait par un excedent de 5,262 wagons francais en Italie.         ;&apos; On consent, pour venir en aide aux chemins de fer italiens a ce que, pour     le moment, la balance entre le materiel francais en Italie et le materiel italien en     France continue a  s&apos;etablir aux environs de 5.000 a 6,000 wagons en faveur des     chemins de fer italiens           Tel est leffort maximum  qui peut etre fait par les Gouvernements britan-     nique et francais, qui s&apos;engagent dailleurs a hater tous les moyens de recharge-     ment des wagons destines au ravitaillement de leurs armees en Italie.           II est entendu que si le programme de transport de charbons a destination     de lTtalie est augmente comme il en a ete question le 9 Janvier courant avec Sir     Joseph Maclay, le  materiel roulant et le personnel necessaire pour faire face a     cette  augmentation seront  fournis a la France  et n&apos;entreront pas  en  ligne de     compte dans le chiffre ci-dessus.&quot;     Dans cet accord il etait admis  que, pour tenir compte des  transports fait parITtalie a destination ou en provenance de France et des transports de ravitaillementet autres necessites pour lentretien des armees britanniques et franchises operant surle front italien, 1&apos;echange des wagons se traduirait pour un  benefice de 5.000 a 6,000wagons en faveur de lTtalie.   M. Claveille, voulant se placer dans  le cas 1 i plus favor-able pour  IItalie, admet le chiffre de  6,000 wagons.     Le l,r Janvier, 1918, c&apos;est-a.-dire  a peu pres au moment ou la  note ci-dessus a eteredigee, le n^en  des charbons italiens transites par la France selevait  k 4,800 tonnes.se composant ainsi:              Blaye-Bordeaux   ...        ...       ...              3,000             Mine d&apos;Alois     ...        ...                      L200             Mine de St. Etienne       ...       ...               600Soit...       .........    4,800[341]on 5,000 tonnes environ.F
     Aujourdlmi il s&apos;agit de transporter 15,000 tonnes par jour, soit 10,000 tonnessupplementaires.  Avec ses wagons de 20 tonnes et une rotation moyen  de six joursen France, ce transport exigera au moins 500  x 6, soit 3,000 wagons de 20 tonnes, enne tenant pas compte des wagons par cause de reparation.     Pour rester dans Fesprit de la  note ci-dessus du 10 Janvier dernier, le  Gouverne-ment italien doit fournir les 3,000  wagons de 20 tonnes.   II est possible darriver ace resultat en admettant que la balance de 6,000 wagons mentionnee dans cette notes&apos;est reduite de 6,000  a 3,000 wagons, la moyenne etant faite par  semaine.   Bienentendu, avec cette condition il sera expressement convenu en outre que le  Gouverne-ment italien restituera a la frontiere unite pour unite des wagons houillers transpor-tant le charbon en Italie.     La position des wagons  etant ainsi reglee, il reste a examiner celle  des loco-motives et du personnel.     Pour  les locomotives  le Gouvernement italien a promis de fournir a la Com-pagnie P.L M. 80 locomotives equippes.   Cette compagnie ayant supporte la plusgrande  partie de Feffort  demande  aux chemins de fer francais, il convient de luidonner un secours nouveau en maniere de traction.   M. Claveille, sans fixer de chiffrea  ce sujet, demande a M.  Bianchi,   Ministre  des Transports italien, de  mettre a sadisposition un certain nombre de  machines  supplementaires  avec  le personnel deconduite et d&apos;entretiens.     M. Claveille demande egalement que M. Bianchi  fournisse au P..L.M. sur leslignes aboutissant a, Modane et Ventimille un certain nombre d5agents de  Fexploita-tion pour les trains et  charbons italiens.   Le personnel, devrait etre considere aupoint de vue de la responsabilite comme s&apos;il appartena.it aux chemins de fer francais.     M.  Claveille insiste enfin sur Feffort extremement important qui va  etre imposeaux reseaux francais au fait de ces  transports, et il compte sur toute la bonne volontedu Gouvernement italien pour faciliter leur tache.     Dans ce qui concerne les operations  a faire dans  les ports  de  la Mediterraneepour  F expedition et la  manutention des charbons,  M.  Claveille  declare  qu&apos;ilprendra  les  mesures utiles pour donner  a Fltalie   les  places a. quais, les  terre-Dleins et Foutillage indispensables a Fexecution rapide des operations.  Le Gouverne-ment italien pourra Conner les manutentions  a ses entrepreneurs francais comme aBlaye, mais il devra fournir tous les manoeuvres necessaires.    M.  Bianchi remercie  M. Claveille de ses declarations  et  precise  les  pointssuivants:      1. II fournira  la main-d&apos;ceuvre a employer dans les ports de la Mediterranee           pour le dechargement des wagons et le chargement des navires.    2. II s&apos;efforcera de donner satisfaction aux demandes de locomotives et  de per-           sonnel  dexploitation  formulees ci-dessus dans  la  plus large  mesure           possible.    3. II accepte de faire restituer regulierement les wagons houillers dans les condi-           tions indiquees par M.  Claveille.    4. En ce qui concerne  la balance des wagons, tout en constatant que la  reduction           a 3,000 du chiffre des 6,000 indiques plus haul causera une grande gene           au service des transports de lTtalie, il admet les propositions de M. Cla-           veille apres avoir pris Favis de M. Berini.   Mais il insiste  aui^res  du           General Nash, representant du Gouvernement britannqiue, pour  que celui-           ci lui fournisse des wagons en vue de combler le deficit, etant donne que ce           transport de charbon par fer va economiser du tonnage et que tous les           Allies doivent faire un  effort commun pour  se partager les charges.    M. le General Nash repond que cette question nest pas necessairement liee auxprecedentes, mais que dans tous les cas les wagons anglais n ont pas le meme attelageque les wagons italiens; quils ne peuvent pratiquement  pas circuler sur  les lignesitaliennes,  et que meme la solution  serait-elle favorable,  elle ne  pourrait  utilementintervenir avant plusieurs  mois, alors  qu&apos;il faut immediatement venir au secours delTtalie.                                                            ...    M.  Bianchi indique alors qiril y aurait  un autre  moyen de venir en aide  deFltalie pour son materiel roulant, et ce serait  de lui donner les moyens de construireles wagons supplementaires qu&apos;elle est obligee  de fournir en ce moment, et  les mate-riaux necessaires a Fentretien du materiel roulant.   Pour 300 wagons il faudrait unefourniture de 18,000 tonnes de materiel.    Le General  Nash promet  de faire etudier cette derniere question lorsque leselements  necessaires  lui auront ete fournis.
Appendix No.  9.     Effect of the A merican Military Programme on the Supplies of the A Hies.     The Allied Maritime Transport Council have had under consideration this weekthe available tonnage in Allied service in relation to the supply programmes.     The general position may be summarised by saying that the tonnage now  inAllied control (excluding  any&quot;additional neutrartonnage that may be obtained andany tonnage from America not used for her own requirements) will leave a deficit  inthe present supply programmes of the three European Allies of some 10,000.000  tonsof imports, or 2,200,000 tons deadweight of tonnage.     This deficit remains after allowance for reductions already made in  import  pro-grammes which will have serious results, and though it is possible that some furtherreductions  can, under pressure of necessity, be still made, the Council are unanimousthat no reduction of 10,000,000 tons can  be  made without results which  will bedisastrous  to the prosecution of the war.    The Council have arrived at the conclusion that substa - tial assistance (thoughnot adequate to meet the deficit) can only be derived from two sources :     (a.)  The allocation of American tonnage for the use of Allied services.    (b.)  The acquisition of additional  tonnage, particularly  Dutch, of which  the           most important part is in American ports.    For instance, the Council have been faced with the extremely serious position ofthe Italian coal supplies, and have been  unable to see any hope of solution except bythe relief afforded by the use of the Dutch tonnage in America, and they are consciousthat the Allied  cereal position and the supply of other essentials such as nitrates are       [341]                                                          G       Note annexe du procesrverbal de la reunion au 13 mars, 1918, a Londres.     M. Bianchi fait remarquer que, pour assurer 1&apos;execution  du programme  detransport par fer de 9,000 tonnes par jour indique a la reunion du 13 mars  1918 ilfaut temr compte de ce que le debit de la ligne de Ventimille a Modane et de 23 trainset celui de la ligne  de Modane a Turin de Savona.  II ajoute que, pour assurer aveccertitude la totalite des transports de charbons prevue. il est necessaire de limiter lenombre des autres trains de maniere k ne pas depasser la capacite des lio-nes qui vientd&apos;etre indique.     M. Bianchi fait observer que, pour tenir  compte de ce  que les trains lvont pastoujours leur charge complete et de ce qu&apos;il se produit inevitablement des irregularitesdans leur mise en marche, il serait  necessaire quen periode normale la decompositiondes trains fut la suivante :         Sur la ligne de Ventimille a Savona :             12 trains de charbons,             7 trains militaires, y compris ceux de  Tar ante,             3 trains de marchandises,             1 train de voyageurs.        Sur la ligne de Modane a Turin :              8 trains de charbons,             5 trains militaires,             2 trains de permissionnaires,             2 trains de cessions italiennes,             2 trains de materiel vide,             1 train  commercial,             1 train de voyageurs.     II est  pris acte de  la  declaration de  M. Bianchi; il lui est repondu, toutefois,qu il pouvait etre possible en tenant en main a ce que les trains ont une charge com-plete et une marche reguliere de realiser les  9,000 tonnes  par jour avec  unnombre de trains de charbons legerement inferieur a celui qu&apos;il a indique  par Venti-mille et par Modane.                                            (Signe)      A. LOTJCHEUR.                                                         R. BIANCHT.                                                         P. A.  M.  NASH.
no less serious, and cannot be relieved if assistance is not forthcoming from tonnageunder  American control.    Again, the American military purposes employ  some11,000 wagons m France which are taken from other uses vital to French and Italianrequirements.    Large quantities of wagons are ready in America and have not beentransported to France.     In these circumstances, reference was made at the Council to the practicabilityof further American assistance,  but Mr.  Stevens made the very serious statementthat, on present American calculations,  the  American military  programme  nowadopted by the Supreme War Council and agreed by the American Government seemslikely to absorb      (a.) All American tonnage existing and building  not required for American           imports; and     (&amp;,) All additional neutral tonnage which may be received by America.   This           in result includes the whole of the  Dutch tonnage now in American ports     If this proves to be the case the Council are certain that the results to the Alliedsupply programmes will be of the utmost gravity.     The whole position should, therefore, be considered by the Supreme War Councilin the light of the tonnage situation.  As a temporary measure, and in order to avoidthe very serious military position that will result from a failure of the Italian coalsupply, the  Allied Maritime Transport Council recommend that not less than halfthe Dutch tonnage now in American  ports should be placed for one voyage in theservice of Allied supplies, so as to release corresponding tonnage for Italian coal.      March 13, 1918.Appendix No.  10.         Paraphrase of Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague,                                March 8, 1918.    Grave shipping situation  confronts the Allies at present,  Discussions withDutch Delegates of proposals  for  employment of Dutch tonnage had led AlliedGovernments to hope that when these proposals came  into force they would securefor Allied service outside the danger zone a large  quantity of Dutch tonnage.  Ifthese  hopes  had been justified  at the time, arrangements could have been made towithdraw other tonnage from the danger zone and replace it by Dutch vessels pro-vided under the agreement.  Continued delay of  Netherlands Government in comingto an agreement has produced a situation in which this can no longer be done con-sistently with securing the most suitable employment of shipping during the forth-coming critical period.   Although the terms of the general arrangement were agreedupon, ad referendum, in January last by British  and Dutch Delegates in London, nofurther  communication has yet been received from Netherlands Government, and thesituation which has  arisen renders  it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government toawait longer the conclusion of the general arrangement.  The importance to the Alliesof obtaining the employment of Dutch vessels, without restriction as to the waters inwhich they may sail, is so great that I am compelled to ask you to inform Ministerfor Foreign  Affairs that owing to the long delay of the Netherlands Government inreplying to our proposals, the necessity has arisen of requiring a modification in theoriginal tonnage proposals for the purpose of ensuring that the employment of Dutchvessels shall  be without restriction. In making this communication you are authorisedto  intimate  unofficially that, in order that the request now put forward may berendered acceptable,  we hope to see our way to propose to the Netherlands Govern-ment, on behalf of the Allied Governments, that at the termination of the war anyDutch vessels lost in the existing danger zone through enemy attack while on chartertc the Allies shall be replaced.  It is also hoped that it may be found possible to makearrangements to place in a United States port 50,000 tons of  wheat before the 15thApril next,  for the use of the Netherlands Government and to supplement this con-Si gnment by a similar quantity at a port on the  South American Atlantic seaboard.    It is earnestly hoped that the  Netherlands  Government  will see their way toaccept these terms.
Appendix No.  11.                WAR INSURANCE.Meeting at Lancaster House, Wednesday, March 13, 1918.                       Present:                                Mr. Morrow, United States.                                Mr. Hipwood, Great Britain.    M. Loucheur said that the French Government were much preoccupied with theincreased cost of living, and the very greatly increased cost of all articles importedby sea.   One of the principal causes was the high cost of  freight and  insurance.Under the  present system a certain  amount of this was due to preventable causes,and if some system could be found for the Governments concerned jointly to take thewar insurance risks and pool them, he thought the situation would be considerablyeased.  Such  an arrangement would also benefit the exchange position, as  at presentFrance  and  Italy,  for  instance, had to  pay large  sums in cash  for freight andinsurance.    M. Loucheur said he did not suggest that a difficult question like this could besolved at once, but he thought that it ought to be investigated. He proposed, there-fore, to place a  memorandum containing his  views before the Inter-Allied FinanceCouncil, and  if they approved, he thought that the matter should be investigated bya small Allied &quot;technical committee.    Mr.  Morrow, on  behalf of the United States, said the question was almostentirely one of finance, and should be dealt with by the financial authorities.    Mr.  Hipwood, on  behalf  of Great  Britain, said that  the British Delegationwould be  prepared to  render  any  assistance in their power in investigating thesubject.Appendix No.  12.                    Agreement in regard to Neutral Tonnage.                                                             March 13, 1918.    The Governments of France, Italy, and Great Britain are agreed that the wholeof the neutral tonnage ought to be put under Inter-Allied control to be employed inaccordance with the &quot;resolutions of the Paris Conference of the 1st Deecmber, 1917.    In order to secure the effective execution of this principle, they  have furtheragreed upon the following modifications in the present practice of dealing with thechartering of neutral ships:     1.  All future time-charters of neutral steamers will be made under the direction          of the Inter-Allied Chartering  Committee, acting for  the  Allied Mari-          time Transport Council, and on terms and conditions prescribed by that          Council.   The  charters   will  be  signed by firms  nominated  by  the          Associated Governments in proportions to be settled by agreement. Pend-          ing the conclusion of such agreement, the signing of the charters will be1M.  Loucheur,M. Bijard,       ^-France,M. Brichaux,     JSignof Orlando,  1  JtalM.  Brizzolesi,    J     ^    The Allied Governments attach so much importance to a speedy termination of astate of affairs, in which the German submarine campaign is receiving direct supportby the idleness of a large number of Dutch vessels, that in the event of the&apos;Nether-lands Government being  unable to accept the  present proposal thev will be con-strained to adopt other steps in order to bring these vessels into service&quot;!    Moreover, in view of  the  increasing  urgency of the matter, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must ask  to be favoured with a reply on the 18th March next at thelatest.    I have spoken to M. van Vollenhoven in the above sense.
      so arranged that the nominees of France, Italy, and Great Britain shall      have as nearly as may be equal amounts of tonnage chartered to  them      direct  from the owners.   In the event of the United States Government      subscribing to  this  agreement and  joining the Committee, a further      agreement will be necessary in regard to the proportions in which the      charters will be made.2.  Every steamer  so  time-chartered will at once be  relet to the Inter-Allied      Chartering Committee, acting  for   the  Allied Maritime  Transport      Council, for the period of the war or for the period of the charter if that      should prove to be less than the period of the war.   Every steamer so      time-chartered,  whichever of the  nominees may have signed the  time-      charter, shall be employed during the period of the war as directed by the      Allied Maritime Transport Council in  accordance with  the resolutions      of the Paris Conference of the 1st December, 1917.3.  Each steamer will be allocated for a round voyage,  or, in the case of vessels      in short voyage trades, for a period of three months, the period for which      the allocation is made being determined by the Inter-Allied Chartering      Committee, acting for the Allied Maritime Transport  Council, ,al the      time of allocation, and the sub-charter arranged accordingly.4.  All recharters of steamers  over  1,000   tons  deadweight which have been      allotted  by the  Inter-Allied  Chartering  Committee  since  the 15th      January, 1917,  and all steamers under 1,000  tons deadweight allotted      since the 9th May, 1917,  will come up for reallocation and will be dealt      with as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 above.5.  So far as  possible neutral tonnage will be taken on time-charter or for con-      secutive voyages,  and charter-parties for a single voyage will only be      approved when it is recognised that a time-charter cannot be effected.6.  All allocations of tonnage made in accordance with the preceding paragraphs      are subject to any revision which may be found necessary by the Allied      Maritime Transport Council, established in accordance with the decisions      of the Paris Conference of the 1st December, 1917.7.  The Associated Governments will keep.one another fully informed  of  all      steps  taken for  the  purpose of  securing further neutral or ex-enemy      tonnage.
