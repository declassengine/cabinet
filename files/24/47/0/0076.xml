MINISTRY OP SHIPPING     Memorandum by tho  Shipping Controller for the  information ofthe 17ar Cabinet on a discussion with Quartermaster-General fromprance as to supply services in France in the light of theMemorandum of 4th April,  of the Secretary of Stato  for ^7ar.G.T.4130.          The situation as regards             (1)    Military Supplies             f2j    Civilian Supplies             (3)    Provision of Coal to the French, was gone into and the Quartermaster - General was informed as follows ;-     (l)  Military Supplies.   As regards the supplies apart from Timber and Coal, no serious difficulty is expected in maintaining the Army through the Northern Ports.          The supply of 120,000 tons of Timber will be difficult but  part  of this figure 20,000/25,000 tons is already supplied by sea from the Bordeaux area, and the remainder could be supplied from England if the Timber Controller could provide the material. The Quartermaster-General was informed that the demand for Timber should be  cut to the lowest possible figure.          As regards Coal, it was considered that if possible, Coal for the purpose for which we are at present supplying British coal in Northern France should be taken from the Bruay Mines, as these will be unable to supply the south of France in the contemplated emergency.          No particulars were available  as  to  the extent  to which the matters  referred to in the  note  to  Lord Derby!s Memorandumwould involve fresh  demand on shipping,  and this matter  is underdiscussion with  the  War Office-.     (2)   Civilian Supplies.    As regards food for the civilianpopulation,  estimated at  50,000  tons  a month,  the
Quartermaster-General was informed that if the food wereforthcoming, no serious difficulty in shipping it to northernFrench ports by the present organisation for carrying militarysupplies was anticipated, hut there would of course he anincrease in shipping, and additional port accommodation wouldhave to be obtained, from the French.         GOAL NOW $m F5QM MAY       TO Tha SOUTH                     OF THE SOEg      This was estimated by Quartermaster-General to amount to60o,0uG tons monthly, equivalent to about 480,000 tons ofBritish coals.       It was agreed that it would be possible to divert theshipments from U.h. to Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne - say130,000 tons monthly, to other ports leaving a deficit ofabout 360,000 tons.    It was considered that even if the extracoal could be received at the other ports in Prance, theprovision of the extra tonnage would be a matter of greatdifficulty, and that while the Shipping Controller would examinethe problem, no action should be taken in the matter until arequest was received from the French Government for additionaltonnage.       This would then need to be considered by the AlliedMaritime Transport Council.8 April 1918.
