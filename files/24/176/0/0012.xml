CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1925.SECRET.Copx No.CP. 513 (25).THE CABINET.THE MILITARY SITUATION IN IRAQ.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a note I have just received from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. I ask that it may be considered at to-morrow&apos;s Cabinet.I shall suggest that the strength of the Air Force in Iraq should be increased, immediately by units from Egypt and India before the Geneva decision is known.L. W.-E.The War Office,2nd December, 1925.Though the immediate military situation in  Iraq is not a responsibility of the General Staff, they confess to some anxiety as to how it may develop. Recent military intelligence indicates : (a) That the Turks &quot;have now sufficient strength within 100 miles of the Mosulfrontier (65,000) to make it possible for them to undertake an invasion of the Mosul vilayet should they decide to do so.(b) That though an advance from the Nisibin direction on Mosul would be difficult,it is by no means impossible.(c) That should the Turks attack Mosul, they would have the strong, thoughpossibly not overt, support of the Soviet Government.Whether, in the event of a decision by the League unfavourable to the Turkish claims, the Turks would actually invade the Mosul vilayet, no one can say. But the possibility remains that they might.   If they did, the General Staff consider : (1) That air action, though it might delay, could not stop them ; nor, in view of the internal situation likely to arise, could sufficient military forces be made available in Iraq to deal with an invading force in any strength and possessed of artillery.(2) That reinforcements from India could not arrive in time to prevent the capture of Mosul.(3) That to recapture the Mosul vilayet once taken, would involve the mobilization and despatch of the whole British Expeditionary Force.In short, the General Staff consider that the Turks are now in a position to occupy Mosul should they decide to do so.There have been suggestions as to countering a hostile move on the part of the Turks by action against them elsewhere than in Iraq ; as for instance by naval action in the Sea of Marmora or against the Anatolian coast ; or by air action against Angora trom ships or somei temporary island base. Such action, the General Staff consider, would be futile ; the risks would be great, no vital points could be seized, and no military forces are available to exploit any temporary impression that might be made.(B25/17)   100   12/25   W.O.P.   2445
Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the Turks are installing defences at Smyrna in reported anticipation of the possibility of British naval action in certain eventualities.Action against Turkey in Europe in concert with Balkan Allies could never be permissible, because of the appalling consequences which must inevitably follow.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as far as the General .Staff understand it, stops short at reliance on the Turk&apos;s loyal acceptance of the League&apos;s decision, which is shortly due ; but in the event of this reliance proving to be misplaced, what plan of action is it proposed to follow ? War with Turkey would mean military action on a scale which the Army Council, on whom the burden and conduct of the campaign would devolve, view with dismay. Such a war would involve the whole of the reduced military resources of the Empire, and, even if successful, would be entirely profitless, disastrously expensive and of unlimited duration.The General Staff have no wish to be alarmist, and they have no solution to offer of the Iraq problem. But they think that it is incumbent on them to leave no doubt as to the profound misgivings with which they would regard a resort to- war on this issue.
