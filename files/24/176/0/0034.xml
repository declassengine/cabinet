We understand that the Bill as drawn meets with the approval - of the Treasury.In the Weir Report there were certain subsidiary recommendations with regard to alterations in the Electricity Acts which were not necessarily connected with the &quot;Gridiron&quot; scheme.    sVe have omitted these subsidiary points from the Bill.    Many of them would   -raise considerable controversy:    and we consider it desirable that this Bill should be/
A eA I;limited to the establishment of the Gridiron scheme. If these minor points are thought to bo desirable there is no difficulty in their incorporation in a separate Bill to bo introduced by the Minister of Transport and submitted to the Home Affairs Commitfee in the ordinary way.Under the Feir scheme the Board was to have pc &quot;sr to operate Generating Stations itself and to construct new Generating Stations if necessity arose.     We have provided in the Bill no power for the erection of new Generating Stations by the Board;    it is improbable that it will be necessary for the Board, to do this,  and in that event we think they should, apply to parliament for the necessary power.     We have also limited the power of operating existing stations to cases in which it is proved, to the satisfaction of the Commi ssionors that no one else could be found to undertake that duty.     We think it very unlikely that this power will ever ha,ve to be exercised, but we think its existence is necessary in order to enable the Board to come to rea so male terms with the owners of such  stations for their operation.We have found great difficulty in deciding what steps are to be taken to ensure that the undertakers will avail themselves of the advantages of the Grid.iron scheme in preference to continuing the use of their own stations. The advantage of lower price is under the Bill to bo parsed on to  the consumer, and this we regard, as an important
factor,  so that the only advantage to the undertaker will be the increased consumption resulting from the lower price end this may not always be a sufficient inducement.      The plan which we have ultimately adopted was suggested by the Lord president and seems to us the best possible solution.      In effect it provides that if an undertaker continues t-o operate his own station after being offered a supply from the Gridiron his price to the consumer shall be reduced by the difference between his cost of generation and the Gridiron price for the same quantity of electricity.The above are the main points in which the Weir scheme has not been adopted.We, therefore,  recommend(l) that the Cabinet approve the Bill as now submitted.(2) that the Minister  of Transport be authorised to communicate with  those interested in the scheme, such  as authorised undertakers, electrical manufacturers,  gas und ertaking3, etc., and to inform them % hat the Government proposes to introduce a Bill in this form in the coming year, and to obtain from them any suggestions which they may  desire to submit.(3.) that the Weir Report bo not published at present.f Intd. ) D.Moll.Royal Courts of Justice.
