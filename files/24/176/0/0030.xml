CHRIST I AST BSPORT.iT I .NS IN TEE NEIGHBOURS GOD 0? THE 3RU3 JELS LINE.Memorandum on- the;Enquiry conducted between November 8th and 11th, 1926 by1 Hi Bdi Ortega Nunez; M.H. Markus and Ml B. Charrerei -The refugees who sUcdeeded ih escaping deportation by the Turks are difetribdted in the town, of Zakho and the village of Bersivi.       -  .These refugees eome from the villages of Billo, Baijo, Alto and Merga, all situated north of the Brussels 5-ine.The refugees from the first three villag-es were -settled,through the Iraq authorities, at Zakho;    those from Merga atBersivi,     The aocomodation is exceedingly primitive, consistingof a simple army tent or a mud hut.    They are in the utmostphysical and moral distress and, owing to the total absence ofhealth precautions, sickness  (malaria and dysentery) is very rife.By way of help the Iraq authorities allow them each 4 annas aday, which corresponds to about 50 Swiss centimes.    In addition,isa small quantity of foodstuffs/from time to time distributed to themeOn November 1st the total number of refugees was 2,800. It must now exoeed 3,000, for scattered groups of fugitives aro entering Iraq every day.The total population of the deported villages was about 8,000 Catholic Chaldeans, whose principal livelihood consisted in agriculture and cattle-breeding.    The whole ox this population, lite all the Christians in Kurdistan, were unconditionally subject to the feudal authority of an &quot;Agha&quot;, who was in most cases the owner of the village and absolute master of the life and property o the Christians inhabiting it. Every year the pzoduoe of their labour had/,
to be divided in equal parts between the &quot;Agha&quot; and the Christian,    In exchange the &quot;Agha&quot; extended to the Christians of his village a measure of protection which varied in value according to the number of the inhabitants&apos; and oho resources of the village.In spite of&quot; these conditions,,  these people had not oom-plained of their lot.According to information collected by the Iraq author!-tiesj 2,000 inhabitants from these villages have now boon deported north of the Brussols line into, the Elki district,, where they are scattered among sevoral neighbouring villages, In tho absence, however, of any information from the [Turkish Government, we havo not beon able to ascertain the exact number of doported persons, nor of those who have diod (in-eluding those killed) during and since tho deportations. Prom the evidence.collectod it is to be feared that the num-ber of the latter is vory high, and is still growing daily as the result of privation and the ill-troatment inflicted upon these unfortunate people.According to the statement of those who have escaped, the deportees who are in the Turkish concentration camps are entirely without resources.    Their only food is a hand-ful of barley distributed to them by Turkish officers every fortnight, but as soon as this is distributed the gendarmes come along and take it all away from them.    The deportees have therefore to live almost exclusively on acorns, which they find on tho outskirts of the villages, or upon the charity of Kurds and of a few Christian inhabitants more favourably situated.    Further, they have no roof over their-heads, and hardly any clothes and that in a country which is VQ^y-mcnrintainous.^and where the snow is already lying deop
end the cold is intense,,    In these circumstances it will easily be understood that many of them have died of hungerand cold; and that with the arrival of winter, which promisesto be a very hard one, the number of deaths can only increase.Methods of Deportation.___The unanimous evidence which we have collected is to the following effect :(l) Turkish - soldiers lod by their officers began to enter the villages last Ilarch almost immediately after the departure of the Commission of Enquiry from Mosul, and these visits have been since repeated on very frequent occasions.(2.) On. their first visit the soldiers were satisfied with demanding a sum of money varying in amount in each village,.    On the following visits, however, they became more exacting and. in addition to money also demanded sheep, flour, butter and women.    The latter suffered particularly and on several occasions when their husbands interposed, tho latter were massacred in the presence of their wives.    The same fate befell the women if they offered any resistance to the brutal instincts of the Turkish soldiers.At Baijo/alone   40 men are stated to have been suddenly taken away from their families, shut up in a remote building and assassinated in cold blood by Turkish soldiers, who no doubt were anxious not to be disturbed in their orgies by the husbands and parents of the women they intended to outrage(3) At the beginning of September the villages were surrounded by the soldiers, and, after forming up the whole population,, a Turkish officer made the following declaration:
&quot;i war will shortly brealc out between us and the British. As your villages lie on the provisional line,  it is very possible that during hostilities you will be hilled either by ourselves or by the English.    It is therefore better for you to be removed from this danger zone, and the Turkish Government has decided to undertake this removal&quot;. As soonas this statement had been made, marching columns were formed and set off at ones.    Hobody was authorised or given any material facilities for carrying away anything with them from the villagos,  either in the form of food or of clothing. The columns were in most cases formed as follows : Pirst the cattle, then the women and children, while the men brought up the rear of this sad procession.    During the journeys which varied from six to ten days, no food was given to these unfortunate persons, several of whom fell out exhausted by fatigue, thirst and hunger,  and were immediately despatched by the Turkish soldiers with their bayonets or the butts of their rifles.      At their nightly halts the soldiers selected the women they desired and.  if their husbands inter-interfered, the latter were immediately killed.Most of the refugees who are now in Iraq, succeeded in escaping, during the deportation, by bribing sentries with a piece of gold or two which they had been able to keep,  despite the searchos -made.We have separately interrogated the priest,  the mayor (Mukhtar) of each village, whenever possiblo, as well as men of different ages, women and children.
-b-We also bad frequent, opportunities of interrogating fugitives immediately they arrived in Iraq,&apos; and even before they oame into contact with the British or &quot;local Iraq authorities.The evidence of these refugees as regards the conduct of the Turkish soldiers agrees to a remarkable extent.All idea of a voluntary emigration on their part must be excluded.      The more fact that they arrived in Iraq and are still arriving daily in the utmost physical distress and completely without resources proves beyond dispute that they were compelled to abandon their villages by force and violence.    Moreover,  if they had remained in their homes\ they could quite easily have provided for their material wants even though they were obliged to give half of all they had to their &quot;Agha&quot;.    They would therefore never have abandoned their homes of their own accord,    Besides that, they are strongly attached to their homes, and the loss of their family life fills them with despair..  They are simple people, entirely uneducated. The village priest is the only person who oah read and write Chaldean at all, and even his general education is extremal;/ limited, a fow months of religious teaching from the Chaldean Bishop of Sakho sufficing to obtain for him his ordination as priest and his incumbency.      It is typical of the complete ignorance of these people that not one of them knows his age,  and when we questioned them on this point they invariably replied &quot;We donrt know,  for it has never been written dovai&quot;They showed no hesitation in replying to our questions and we never found any contradiction at all
bo two on tho statements made by persons of the same village.    . In face of their obvious simplicity, there can be no question of any previous agreement between them as to the statements they would make.-The Christian populations in question have not as a rule boon ill-treated by the Kurds.    On several occasions the latter even encouraged or protected deportees in their flight to Iraq.    Furthermore, from information which wo have received, &quot;out which wo could, not check because wo were unable to carry out any investigations north of the Brussels lino, the Kurdish Aghas themsolvos protested to the Turkish authorities against the deportations, not from any humanitarian . feelings, but because of the loss which thoy sustained through the departure of tiie Christian population, which constituted their principal labour market.    According to information obtained from different sources, tho Kurdish chiefs received a o ommuni cat ion from the Turkish authoritio shortly before the deportations, ordering them to massacre all the Christians in their villages.    Tho   Aghas then mot to adopt a common policy and to detormino what measures - they should take.    On the proposal of  one of them it was decided that this order should not De obeyed, for, to use their own expression,  it would have meant the &quot;amputation of their own arms&quot;.    Por this refusal several Kurdish chiefs arc said to have been, shot by the Turks. Some succeeded in escaping from this fate by fleeing to Iraq, but thoy had to leave their villages and all thoir possessions.    We saw some important Kurdish chiefs of Moslem faith belonging to the- tribe of Soyans (living on the borders of the frontier), Who have taken refuge in Iraq
and who sought us out in order that we might convey to the league of Nations their wish to have their territory placed within the frontiers of  Iraq, which, they considered, could alono secure for them their life and safety.I have the honour to give below a short summary of the statements made to us with regard to the actions of the Turks by the refugees of tho different villages o(l) Billo, a village of 70.houses.The Turks came for the first time in June, surrounded the -village, prevented the inhabitants from leaving it,  and imposed a fine of 100 Turkish pounds and 40 sheep.    They then plundered the crops, Milch they made the villagers themselves carry to Goyan,  two hours distant from Billo..    They went off, leaving in . the village a picket of about 30 soldiers under 3aky Bey and Saaim Brffendi.    The chief object of this picket was to watch the inhabitants and observe their comings and goings. - The soldiers counted all the persons who went out of the village to work in the country, and if any were found to be missing in the evening,  they beat the Mukhtar.On a second visit the soldiers demanded 100 sheep,  which wore immediately given them.    On September 8th, the village was surrounded by about 300 Turkish soldiers.    The inhabitants and all the cattle were collected in the centre of the village, while the soldiers plundered the houses.    Pine women wore outraged; three others had suffered tho same fate In August at the hands of the Turkish officers and had been deported.
The day on which Billo was plundered (September 8th) the inhabitants were ordered through their mayor, Yo, son of-Mansur, to leave.      The reason given was that as war was going to break out between Turkey and Iraq, it was better for them if they did not wish to be hilled, to be deported into the interior of Turkey.      Thereupon,  the inhabitants were formed up in column with T&quot;. rkish soldiers on either side.      0   the evening of the same day the column arrived at 3 crur.     T -p women were separated from their husbands and outraged.      T ose who attempted to resist were put to death.      This scene was renewed on each of the ten days that the journey from Billo to Gueznah lasted.     Those who fell out by the way, exhausted - by hunger and fatigue, were immediately despatched by the soldiers with blows from their rifles.The Turks had originally intended to conduct these people to Van,  but they were unable to carry out this plan as con-siderable snowfalls blocked the passages through the mountains, they were therefore obliged to leave the deportees at Guezhch.On November 1st about 220 villagers of Billo succeeded in escaping and in taking refuge at Zakho, and although exact details are not available,  it is probable that over 370 inhabitants of the same village are now deportees in Turkey. This number does not include those who were massacred or who died of their privations..2.    Baijo, village of 200 houses.The Turks arrived in this village at the beginning of September and installed themselves there.-    About two weeks later they summoned Paulus the priest,  son of Sahta, Xymer the Lukhtar, son of Korio, and a number of other village notables
and ordered them to hand over all their rifles..     The priest was kept as a hostage and was threatened with being burned alive if all the rifles were not handed over within two hours. To show their determination to carry out this threat if need be, the soldiers placed a con.of petrol in front of him.     Meanwhile other soldiers established themselves in his house and out-raged his wife.     lor did the Mukhtar escape persecution;    he was beaten with cudgels all the time the search for the rifles lasted.      The Turks left the village after taking 140 rifles. Five days later about 350 Turkish soldiers under Djeraal Bey, Fassin Bey, bazi Bey and Eamdi Bey surrounded the village. During tho night they chose 40 of the handsomest women.      Their husbands were shut up in an isolated place and massacred.The deportation did not begin until six days after the occupation of the village, but the soldeirs had previously massacred the old men,  tho sick, and the children whom they judged incapable of following the convoy.      The same fate was meted out to those who fell on the way.Among the evidence taken was that of a certain Szaie, son of Aurava,  and father of three children,  one of whom was killed on the way.      Mis wife, \iio was pregnant and who had fallen ill during the march, was killed before his eyes.      His brother-in-law Isho, son of Zeharick, met with the same fate.One of the families which suffered most was that of the mayor of the village.      Of the 100 members of this faraily only 13 were able to reach Zakho;    the others were all massacred by the Turks.     Moroever his four sisters were taken by the soldiers and are at present at Gueauah with the other deportees.,,.This village was one of the richest in the district and possessed 10,000 head of cattle, all of which have fallen into the hands of the Turks.
Oh November 1st, 540 inhabitants of .3a i jo had taken refuge at Zchko and the number of deportees in the districts&apos; is put at over 550,3.    Alto, a village of 30 houses and 10 families.An officer and 10 Turkish soldiers appeared at tho begin-ring of September and surrounded the vmllrge.      They gave theinhabitants two hours to hand over, the harvest stored in thebarns.     The ten. families were then shut up in a. single house,where they rerjo.ined for 3 days without any food.&apos;     Meanwhile,their houses were pillaged by the soldiers.     During this process 4 men were killed, namely Harko, Shamme, Nazi andanother whoso name we were not given,  together with sevenwomen:    Zeito, Shimun, liansur, Tahlia, Asmar, Warde and lleero.The inhabitants of this village were taken towards Begauda.inThe column was formed up/the following order:    the cattle, the men,  the children and the women.      The latter were subjected on repeated occasions to the outrages of the soldiers.Tho deportees heard the Turks say that they were being-driven from their village because they were Christians.      &quot;We have already done it in the other parts of Turkey&quot; they said, &quot;and now it is your turn.&quot;4.    T.f.erga, a village of 200 houses.The Turks came to this village on four different occasions.      In March they took straw,  25 mules and 12 donkeys.In June they took 150 rifles and seized 60 men, whsm they bound, telling them they would all be killed if 60 more rifles were not given up.      They also demanded 100 measures (a measure - 13.5 kilogrammes)  of corn and barley.In July they took   50 measures of barley, 100 sheep and 60 head of cattle and demanded the payment of 150 Turkish gold pounds.      Two mon were killed;   -  4 women were taken by tlie officers, kept for over a month and rendered pregnant.
At the beginning of September the village was surrounded by 500 soldiers under Colonel Backy and the following officers: Sidquy Bey, ? Bey, Sallin Effendi, Ismahin Effendi, Majid Effendi, Sukry Bey and Sadrey Effendi. The deportation began immediately. The women were separated from the men and from the children and the column set out between two files of ?tries. Two men, 40 years of age, Ushaua, son of Wardie and Lisham, son of Markhaie, were killed in the village when the column was being formed up. Five women, between 40 and 50 years of ago, Marian, daughter of Zaya, warde, daughter of Tando, Yammo, daughter of Marcus, ?, daughter of Simon, and Souze, daughter of Zouco, who fell on the way, were buried under large stones and left there alive. Three girls were Killed and several children abandoned on the way dying of hunger, their mothers no longer having the strength to carry them.

According to information received, there were on November 1st, 970 refugees from M?rga at Bersivi and 860 inhabitants of the same village have been, deported to Turkey and distributed among the villages of Elki, Gu?,  ? and Chevad. About 60 persons have already died in captivity. To justify this deportation the Turks declared that there was going to be a war between them and Irak.

The Turkish officers and soldiers who took part in the deportations and committed the acts denounced in the present memorandum all belonged to the 62nd regiment of Turkish Infantry.
