CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1925, ,SECRET - ....CP. ol7(25).   &apos;: . , ...   &apos;&quot; &apos;CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN.With reference to Cabinet 30 (25), Conclusion 1. I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, copies of telegrams from the Government of India regarding policy towards Afghanistan and of the replies sent with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.7th December 1925. BIRK EN HE AD.From Yicerou, Foreign and Political Department, 7th October 1925.1255 S. Foreign and Political Department. We have been discussing with Humphrys the persistent infiltration of Russian personnel into Afghanistan, which has been growing steadily ever since Stark appeared on the scene and shows no sign of abatement. One of its most dangerous features is that it proceeds insidiously on commercial or pseudo-commercial lines or in the guise of assistance to the Afghan Government in the development of Afghanistan, and Avith one exception seems to offer no opportunity for us to raise specific objection with the Afghan Government. That exception is the employment of Russian personnel in Air Force. We do not, of course, assert that this Russiiication shows that Afghanistan has determined on an unfriendly and provocative course of policy towards us. Indeed, it must not be forgotten that it was to us that Afghanistan turned for aviation personnel in last year&apos;s crisis, after having failed some time previously to secure Italian or sufficient German personnel for this purpose. Nevertheless, the fact remains that this Russification is unfriendly and provocative to us in actual effect, and we feel that the time has come when we can no longer afford to let it develop further without attempting to arrest its progress.There seem to be three forms in. which objection might be raised with the Afghan Government:- (a) To say frankly that the presence of Russian personnel in the Afghan Air Force is, in effect, unfriendly and provocative to us, and that, unless it is got rid of within a reasonable time, we shall have to take our stand on the treaty, and adjust our own attitude accordingly ; (b) to say that we are not prepared to allow aeroplanes or spares or spirit to transit India to Afghanistan without a written guarantee that they will not be used by Russians ; [c) to say that just as we have declined to tolerate the presence of Russian Consulates in south-eastern zone as being anti-British in design and effect, so we should regard Russian aviation personnel in south-eastern zone as unfriendly and provocative, and should take our stand on the treaty accordingly. -First course seems much too drastic. The fact that we have raised no objection to Russian aviation personnel during the past year almost appears to stop us from taking categorical objection now. If we did so we should be humiliating the Amir. For he could not save his face if he acceded to our demands and abandoned his well-advertised fait accompli. Nor indeed could he afford to dry up Russian sources of aviation supplies, more especially at a time when four more aeroplanes are still due under the Riisso-Afghan treaty. Quite clearly this demand would result in a deadlock.The second course, which was mooted hy Minister over three years ago, vide Katodon 42, dated 15th June 1922, would not achieve our object now that the Russian source of aviation supplies has been opened. True, it would be an obstable to the supply of training machines, which our technical advisers inform us would be compelled to take a roundabout route, as this type of machine is unlikely to be able to fly over the hills to the north, and their transport across them by road is at present impracticable. In regard to spares and spirit, we could apparently put temporary obstacles in the way, but, in all probability, at the cost of driving the Afghans still further into the hands of Russia and of eventual development of the northern route. 849-1      100   12.25
At the same time, we propose to consider how- best we can keep a check on the export of aeroplanes and aviation stores supplied to the Afghan Government through India.On this showing we are forced back upon the third course. Its advantages are: (1) However inconvenient it may be to them,&apos;Afghan Government could accept it without&apos; loss of face, because it is not a fail, accompli ; (2) it is on the lines of the fundamental attitude towards Russia which we have taken up already and which Afghanistan, has been forced to recognise as not unreasonable in the case of Consulates ; (3) it would in the end probably force Afghanistan to get rid of Russian personnel gradually. For Kabul is not an all-the-year-round air station, and an air station at Jalalabad, or somewhere else in the south-eastern zone, is apparently a necessity if an air force is to be efficient all the year round. We are informed by Sinister that Amir is anxious to establish as soon as possible.a training school in Jalalabad, for which the higher altitude of Kabul is not so well suited.&apos;Even this demand is one that the Afghan Government is not likely to accede to without a struggle, but we may hope that Ilumphrys will be assisted in his task by the changed atmosphere that may be expected from the initiation of a policy of assistance in kind.   We consider that a formal warning in writing would, at this stage at any rate, be impolitic, and we would suggest that Humphry? should convey tlie warning orally to the Foreign Minister immediately on his return to Kabul. Humphrys has impressed upon us that it is essential to disabuse Afghan Government of any idea that we are objecting to the development of the Afghan Air Force as such, and. that his position would be enormously strengthened if he could emphasise that it was solely to the employment of Russians and not to Afghans or other foreigners ill the south-eastern, zone that 1:1 is Majesty&apos;s Government took exception.   This reinforces strongly view we ourselves took in our telegram 1.111 S. regarding the desirability of elasticity in the application of the Versailles Treaty as regards the employment of German aviators in Afghanistan, who seem to be only practical alternative to Russians.   As regards the employment of British personnel in the Afghan Air Force at this stage we endorse Ministers objections contained in  his despatch No. 56 of 1923, and are fortified in so doing by the consideration of the principle underlying our present proposals, viz. that the employment of Russians or English in Afghan Air Force in present circumstances must be provocative to the other party.   Humphrys considers, and we see no reason for disagreeing, that the employment, of English later in the development of civil aviation, at any rate in sotitli-easfern Afghanistan, should be encouraged.From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 23rd October 1925.1323 S. Forminka 35. We have discussed with Minister question of countering Russians with their own propaganda weapons, and we feel that, in the peculiar oircupistances of Afghanistan, it is unlikely that it would achieve its purpose and might undermine the confidence in British sincerity that seems to be. slowly displacing tlie old suspicion. At the same time we agree that Humphrys should continue to expose tactfully in Kabul Soviet designs, whether for expansion southwards or for making use of Afghanistan as a cat&apos;s- paw against India. Over and above the measures advocated in our telegram No. 1255 S. for the exclusion of Russian aviators from the south-eastern zone, we think our efforts should be directed along the following lines : (1) Soviet Government should be given clearly to understand, when favourable Opportunity offers, that any attempt at the absorption of Herat or other northern provinces of Afghanistan into the Soviet system would caiise grave offence to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) While, discouraging by every means in our power employment of Russians in the military forces of Afghanistan, we should remove any doubt as to the sincerity of our motive by abstaining, as far as possible, from placing obstacles.in the way of AThiFs employment of other foreigners.(3) We should, endeavour to wean the Amir, from dependence on Russia by granting him material ^assistance in kind, provided that &quot;he asks for it, has earned it, and it is to the mutual advantage of India and Afghanistan. In no way;, perhaps,&apos; could the community of Indo-Afghan interests be better fostered than by the&apos; civilising Influence of increased trade and intercourse that would &quot;arise from the progressive improvement of communications between  the two countries;   hence  our endorsement of .the
Minister&apos;s proposals for improvement of the trunk road between Kabul and India, We have reason to believe that the Atnir&apos;s schemes for internal progress include extension of railways into his country, and that he already contemplates.a survey by Germans. We think, therefore, that, if the Amir makes any overtures to us,, we should express our willingness to provide him with an expert, survey for a railway extension either to Jalalabad or Kandahar. The general question of extension of the railway system into Afghanistan, raised in Ministers despatch No. 23, has been engaging our attention, and we hope to address you in detail on it before long. Other suitable forms of assistance would be the free loan of Indian experts for the construction of telegraph lines to Ohaman, Kandahar, and Kabul, and Humphrys will endeavour to encourage the Amir to put forward request on.his return, in view of the Russian offer, of which we have just received specially reliable information ; also of Indian personnel to work the telegraph or radio system until Afghans are trained ; assistance at a later stage over civil aviation on an air route between India and Afghanistan; po3sib]y also assistance to a British, company to compete with reported Russian offer to instal a wireless station at Kabul, connecting direct with Europe. Each of these possible forms of assistance would, of course, have to be examined in detail if and when the occasion arose, and we do not contemplate anything more at this stage than would, be covered by Ministers proposals for expenditure of 7 lakhs of rupees annually.We consider that the Amir&apos;s;.request for education of Afghan youths in England offers no reasonable prospect of success without preliminary training, which is at present almost wholly lacking, and : we are not in favour of a gift, or sale at concessional.i;ates, of military equipment other than transport vehicles.Apart from its effect in countering Russian penetration, we feel that the policy above suggested would help to reconcile the Amir to the continuance of the present treaty, would serve as a useful sign of our appreciation of his correct behaviour during the past 18 months on the frontier, and encourage him to link his fortunes with India by facilitating the progress of south-eastern Afghanistan on wholesome lines.The policy herein advocated is result of much thought, and discussion with Minister.   We. have reached complete agreement.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 2nd December 1925.3187.   Foreign Department. - . ., Four telegram dated 7th October, No. 1255. Lam reluctant to criticise only proposal you have to make for direct counter-measure against Russian penetration in Afghanistan, especially as it is ,based on consultation with Humphrys and, I gather, he agrees ; but disadvantages seem to me to outweigh possible advantages. You. propose that Humphrys should warn Afghan Government orally that we should regard Russian aviation personnel in south-eastern zone (I am not sure whether this is intended to cover passing visits or only definite location there) as unfriendly and provocative and should take our stand on treaty accordingly, by which I understand you to mean that we should refuse transit for munitions under Article 6.   (There seems no question- of bringing case within terms of third letter appended to treaty, and though we might claim that aviators are really representatives of the Russian Government, they are primarily,Afghan employees.) It would be undesirable to give warning-even orally unless we are clear as to what we mean and are prepared to act np to it. In view of facts that British attitude towards Afghan enquiries for aeroplanes -and aviators has hitherto been, rather unresponsive, that Russians . seem at present to be; only personnel, available, and that we . have-taken no objection to their employment in general, I cannot help feeling that Afghans would have good ground for saying that proposed attitude -was unreasonable. I do not gather, that you would regard mere stationing of Russians at Jalalabad as in itself a serious additional menace, either in a military sense or from the point of view of propaganda, and I--should doubt whether advantage of preventing this, if we succeeded in preventing it, would counterbalance risk of friction and misunderstanding with general deterioration-of relations, while prospect of more extensive effect in the direction of ousting Russian personnel..from. Afghan Air Service seems very uncertain. Apart.from question of reasonableness, your proposal would appear in effect to involve possibly substantial interference with development of Afghan Air Force, and Afghan, suspicions as to ulterior motives would no doubt be aroused. On the other hand indication of British nervousness of Russia might renew Afghan hopes, which our attitude recently may have quenched somewhaC of playing on this feeling.
Reluctant though I am to dismiss idea of direct counter-measures against Russian; activity, I am disposed to think that unless we are. to adopt some more li heroic &quot; policy and no such policy seems at present to suggest itself as practicable it would in the long run be better to rely rather on steady pursuance of friendly policy on our side, reinforced by &quot;subsidy in kind &quot; and by minor measures in particular cases, and on Afghan perception of contrast between this and aggressive and unscrupulous policy of Soviet and of urgent necessity in their own interests of checking Russian penetration. Humphrys would no doubt find opportunities of stimulating perception of latter point.As regards particular case of Air Force it seems doubtful whether, any foreigners other than Russians would be available. Foreign Office see strongest objections to anything in the nature of open recruitment of Germans even if they were willing to come. Moreover, replacement of Russians by Germans, though so far to the good, would hardly tend towards establishment of British connection and influence which should presumably be our ultimate aim. Natural idea to inculcate in Afghans (and best for our purpose) would appear to be that they should man their own air force. If we could, in pursuance of this idea, also show somewhat greater readiness than hitherto to assist in. training Afghans to fly British machines, and to supply machines and spares, &amp;c. for machines obtained, from us, this might perhaps be best we could do at present towards ousting Russian influence and substituting British. Humphrys could, of course, at the same time intimate to Afghans that the presence of Russians at Jalalabad, even as Afghan enaployees, could not but arouse our suspicious, and add that we should expect Afghans to take suitable action if they were found to be engaged in anti-British activities.Most obvious application at present of policy suggested above would be assistance in training Afghan aviators and mechanics, from which general development of British connection and influence -would naturally follow. Humphrys could probably lead Afghans to ask for such assistance, but question of expense would at once arise. Air Ministry consider that Afghans might be trained in England or possibly in. Egypt, but cost would be approximately  4 each per day for pilots. It was suggested that Afghans might be trained in India as mechanics for  180 a year each, Afghan Government find ing pay and cost of rations. Period of training for either pilot or mechanic would be about one year. Question of providing such training for a limited number of Afghans if opportunity offers as part of &quot;subsidy in kind &quot; seems well worth consideration.As regards supply of spare parts and spirit it would be advantageous if Afghanistan relied on British channel of supply, and as alternative channel is available and will in any case be developed as far as possible by Russians it would seem desirable generally speaking to facilitate supply from and through India. But so long as they are in control in Afghanistan Russians will no doubt do what they can to discredit British supplies, and this may be a reason in some cases for hesitating to supply from Government stocks or for indicating to Afghans that British supplies of a technical character cannot be expected to work efficiently in the hands of Russians.Foreign Office concur in this telegram. I shall be glad of any further observations from you and from Humphrys.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department 2nd December 1925.3188. Your telegram dated 23rd October, 1323 S. His Majesty&apos;s Government agree generally in broad lines of policy indicated, but as regards point (1) they see at present little prospect of gaining anything by representations to Soviet Government, and as regards point (2) difficulty as to Germans must be remembered. Please repeat to Humphrys.
