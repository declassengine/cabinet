CONFIDENTIAL 1IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BEITANNIC MAJESTY\S GOVERNMENT) .2UL 5L1L*L,......b L. LJi *MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.I desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to the Tithe Bill, which, will come \rp for second, reading in the House of Lords on Thursday next.The Bill embodies a fair bargain in respect of the tithe payable to the clerical tithe-owners.     They will receive  100 (free of rates)  for every  100 (nominal) of tithe rent-charge,  and with this they are quite content.But the lay tithe-owners, who include many of the Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge and some of the great public schools  (Eton, Winchester, etc), will be in a different position.     Under the Act of 1918 they are now receiving - 109,3*11 per  100 (nominal)  subject to rates;    and if that Act is allov?ed to lapse at the end of this year, they will receive about  130 (subject to rates) under the Act of 1836. The Bill &quot;stabilizes&quot; their tithe at  105 subject to rates, which would give them about  70 net *     The immediate loss to Oxford and Cambridge alone has been estimated by the Secretary of State for Viar at  5,000 per annum on the present basis of  109.3.11;    and on the basis of  130 it will,  of course, be much larger.      The Colleges are not satisfied that  105 correctly represents the probable average of receipts in future years,  and they would much prefer to retain their rights under the Act of 1836.     Their view is tnat the effect of the Bill is to transfer a part of their rights to the tithe-payers  without compensation.B C R E T.COPY NO.CABINET.P, 505(25).-1-
An amendment in favour of the colleges and pvtbllc schools and other charitable foundations was moved by Mr. Rawllnson in the Hou.se of Commons, and was only defeated by a majority of 59, - 18 Unionists voting against the Government and many others abstaining,     i understand that a similar amendment will be moved by Lord Ernie in the House of Lords,   vhere it is likely to meet with much support. I am boxmd to say that I think the educational and other charities have a substantial grievance, and I suggest that the Minister in charge of the Bill should be authorised to say that the point will be further considered before the Committee stage.     A possible solution would be that the payment of  109.3.11 under the existing Act should be continued (as to lay tithed for two or three years, during which time the basis of stabilization could be considered by a Committee and the matter could then be dealt with by Parliament.50 olio 25.C.
