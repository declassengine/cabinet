REPORT.1. The time at our disposal before the British Representatives had to proceed to Geneva has been so short that we have only been able to hold three meetings for the examination of the question referred to us by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Governments of the Dominions which are members of the League of Nations were advised by cable of the institution of this enquiry and the suggestion was made that they might wish to nominate representatives to take part in our discussions. In reply to this suggestion the Government of the Union of South Africa nominated Mr. J. S. Smit, their High Commissioner in London, who, however, was only appointed in time to attend our last meeting. The Prime Minister&apos;s message of the 18th November and the replies so far received from the Dominion Governments are attached as an Appendix to this Report.2. The task referred to us by the Committee of Imperial Defence falls into three headings, i.e. : (a.) The composition, powers and procedure of the special Committee to be set up at Geneva to undertake the preparatory examination with a view to a Conference on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments;(6.) The principles on which a study of the question of Reduction and Limitation of Armaments should be based; and(c.) The control of manufacture of armaments by private firms.3. With regard to (a) above, we are of opinion that the following considerations should govern the composition and powers of the special Committee, the title of which should, we think, indicate the nature of the work which it will be called upon to carry out. We suggest that a suitable title would be The Preparatory Committee for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.4. We are of opinion that the members of the Preparatory Committee should be confined to Government Representatives, and that the representatives of the Permanent Advisory Commission, Economic, Financial and Transit Committees, and of the International Labour Office should not be members, as it has been found by experience that a combination of Government Representatives and unofficial members is unlikely to lead to successful results.The Government Representatives can be attended by their expert advisers if desired and the Committee as a whole can call upon the various technical organs of the League for any expert advice required as mentioned in paragraph 7, Clause VI.5. It is desirable that the membership of the Preparatory Committee should not be too large. We think it should include representatives of the ten States members of the Council. A strong view was expressed in the Assembly that representatives of other States should be there so that States not represented on the Council should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions. With this object we recommend that, in addition to the members &quot;representing the Council States, other States, not exceeding five, or possibly six, should be invited to attend. Assuming that Germany will now very shortly be a member of the Council, and therefore would sit on, the Committee in that capacity, we recommend that invitations should be sent to five or six States chosen from the following in the order given : (1.) United States of America. (5.) Serbia.(2.) Russia. (6.) Roumania.(3.) Poland. (7.) Holland.(4.) Hungary. (8.) Finland.We appreciate, however, that the United States probably, and Russia almost certainly, will decline to be associated with an enquiry on this subject conducted by the League of Nations.6. Having regard to the nature of its work, the Preparatory Committee should have advisory powers only, but should be authorised by the Council to consult the technical organs of the League -and to call in expert advice and assistance as required. We think the Committee should determine its own rules of procedure, but since it has advisory powers only, we consider that its deliberations should be conducted in private, because publicity is likely to militate against the free discussion of this delicate subject and would tend to compromise the action of the Council when considering the recommendations.We also are of opinion that the Committee should, report by majority vote.7.   We sum up, therefore, our Recommendations in regard to this aspect of our Terms of Reference, as follows :  &apos; :That the following considerations should govern the title, composition and powers of the Special Committee to be set up at Geneva to undertake a[13869] &apos;    . b 2
preparatory examination, with a view to a Conference on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.(i.) The title of the Committee should be &quot; The Preparatory Committee for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.&quot; a r      (ii.) This Committee should consist solely of Government representatives.(This arrangement, however, does not preclude members from obtaining advice from their experts, or the Preparatory Committee from calling in experts to give advice if desired.)(iii.) The nucleus of this Committee should be representatives of the members of Council.(iv.) The additional members of the Committee should be limited to five, or possibly six, who might be invited from the following States in the order given :  1. U.S.A. 5. Serbia.2. Russia. 6. Roumania.3. Poland. 7. Holland.4. Hungary. 8. Finland.(v.) The Powers of this Committee should be advisory; it should sit in private.(vi.) The Council should delegate to this Committee the power to consult the technical organs of the League and to call in expert advice and assistance as required.8. With regard to the second part of our enquiries, namely, the principles on which schemes for the reduction and limitation of armaments might be based, we have drawn up in the form of a programme the questions as to which we think preparatory study might be conducted with advantage. In drawing up this Programme we have had regard to the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government to assist, so far as possible, in the promotion of disarmament, and to avoid any appearance of obstruction. We have, therefore, purposely drawn the Programme as broadly as possible so as to leave to the Preparatory Committee as wide a discretion as possible.9. With regard to Naval disarmament we consider that discussion even of a programme of Naval disarmament, except at a conference in which the&apos; United States of America was willing to participate, would be quite useless, and, if necessary, the British Representative should point this out and should add that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in view of the past history of the question, such a conference would best be held at Washington. The situation is, however, a very delicate one, as the British Delegate at Geneva agreed to taking part in these preliminary studies and we must be careful to avoid any criticism that, after acquiescence, we are being passively obstructive.10. We have been careful, in order to avoid the charge that any suggestion for the abolition of conscription was designed with the object of wrecking the conference, to include this question towards the end of our Programme as a possible alternative should the other investigations suggested be found to hold out little or no hope of securing an appreciable reduction or limitation of armaments. At what period this proposal can most usefully be pressed must depend on circumstances.11. The other items on the programme which we recommend are as follows :   -   ,Land and Air Armaments.(a.) Is it practicable to limit the ultimate war strength of any country or must any measures of disarmament be confined to the peace strength ?(&amp;.) By what standards is it possible to measure the armaments of one country against the armaments of another, e.g., numbers, period of service, equipment, expenditure, &amp;o 1(c.) On what principles would it be possible to draw up a scale of armaments permissible to the various countries, eg.., population, resources, geographical position, &amp;c. ?(d.) Admitting that disarmament depends on security, to what extent is regional disarmament possible in return for regional security; or is any scheme of disarmament impossible unless it is general ? If regional disarmament is practicable, would it promote or lead up to general disarmament?
A ir A armaments only:(e.) Is there any, and if so, what, device by which civil and military aircraft can be distinguished for the purposes of disarmament ?   If this is not practicable, how can the value of civil aircraft be computed in estimating the air strength of any country ? (/.) Is it possible or desirable to apply the conclusions arrived at in (e) above to parts of aircraft and aircraft engines ?(g.) Would the universal abandonment of the principle of compulsory service operate as an effectual limitation of armaments without other measures ?12. There are many other questions, some of which will be raised by the French Government, which might be the subject of enquiry. But we have not included them in our programme because it seems likely that they would be either like the suggested enquiry into the total potential warlike strength of various countries, so large as to be impracticable, or like the proposal that air power might be limited by the abolition of aircraft or civil aviation, not practical politics.Private Manufacture of Arms.13. The last Assembly invited the Council to &quot; continue the preliminary work on the subject of the control of the private manufacture of arms so that a draft convention may be prepared as speedily as possible and that the Council may summon an international conference to consider it, if possible, before the next Assembly.&quot; The Council thereupon instructed the Council Committee to report on the steps to be taken to give effect to the Assembly resolution.14. The present position is that the Council in March last approved the proposal of the Co-ordination Committee that as a preliminary step a questionnaire be drawn up and circulated to Governments. This questionnaire has been prepared, but it has not yet received final approval, and has not yet been circulated.15. We have been informed that a suggestion likely to be put forward is that the Council might be advised to send out the questionnaire at- once, with a request that the replies should be in the hands of the Secretary-General in time for the Preparatory Committee to consider them on the 1st June, so that that Committee might then begin the final drafting of a Convention for submission to the next Assembly.16. We are of opinion that this is the most that could be done at present. In point of fact it may even be too early yet to speak of the preparation of a convention for submission to the next Assembly whether or no this will be possible must evidently depend on the nature of the replies to the questionnaire. For the moment therefore it would be best that the Council Committee should confine itself to recommending the immediate despatch of the questionnaire, with a request for early replies, perhaps before some specific date.General.(Signed)CECIL (Chairman).J.

APPENDIX.[Secret Telegram No. 120.], I.Copy of a Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governors-General of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State, dated November 18, 1.925.(18th November.   Confidential.)Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister/President of Executive Council (begins) : &quot;We have been considering questions raised by resolution adopted by Sixth Assembly of League of Nations on subject of arbitration, security and disarmament, last paragraph of which requests Council of League to make preparatory study with a view to a conference for reduction and limitation of armaments in order that, as soon as satisfactory conditions have been assured from point of view of general security, conference may be convened and general reduction and limitation of armaments may be realised.&quot; At its September session Council of League decided to refer this resolution and relevant documents to Committee of Council, composed of one representative of each State member of the Council, which is to make necessary studies for determining questions which need to be submitted to preparatory study with a view to a possible future conference and to submit report to Council for examination at its December session. We understand Council of League intends that, after meeting of Council in December, preparatory study referred to above should be entrusted to body hitherto known as Co-ordination Committee reconstituted for the purpose.&quot; It seems probable that situation which will result from signature of Treaty of Locarno will be held to justify further advance, and we consider it most important that preliminary work now to be undertaken as contemplated in resolution of Assemby should be on safe lines and such as will ensure real progress. For this purpose our representative on Committee of Council should be in a position to give clear idea of what we think practicable and incidentally, perhaps even inferentially, what we think impracticable.&quot; Accordingly we have decided to appoint Interdepartmental Committee-here, presided over by Lord Cecil, who, we propose, should be our repre-sentative on Committee of Council of League, to advise on attitude to be adopted by him at meeting of Council Committee on 3rd December.&quot; Inter-Departmental Committee will include representatives of Service Departments, and, in view of importance of questions which will come before it, we think that Dominion Governments may wish opportunity to be associated with its work. I should be glad to know whether you would desire arrangements made to this end, and, if so, whom you would nominate as your representative. - It might be found convenient for Dominion repre-sentatives to be also present at Geneva for meeting of Council Committee.&quot;(Secret.)&quot; The Assembly resolution, of course, contemplates ultimate summoning of a general Disarmament Conference under the auspices of the League of Nations. Our&apos; present view is that such a Conference would be most appropriate as regards military and air disarmament, but that having regard to Washington precedent and probable refusal of United States to take official part in League Conference, auy further conference to consider naval disarmament would have the best prospect of success if summoned by the United States Government and held at Washington.&quot;Similar message sent to other Prime Ministers.   (Ends.)&quot; AMERY.&quot;
[Secret Telegram No. 126.]II.Copy of a Telegram, from the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated November 23. 1925.(23rd November.   Confidential.)Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister (begins): &quot; Your telegram of 18th November received, stating that Council of League of Nations in September referred the Assembly resolutions on arbitration, security and disarmament to special committee. Canadian Government share the hope that real progress in disarmament will be found possible. Appoint-ment by British Government of Interdepartmental Committee to advise its representative on the Council Committee should prove helpful. If later development shows that there is a probability of a practical proposal being submitted to the members of the League, Canadian Government would probably appoint similar Interdepartmental Committee and would appreciate copies of any reports or recommendations then available. At the present time it.is not apparent that any very effective consideration of the question involved could be given by participation of any Canadian representatives who would be available in the proceedings of the Interdepartmental Committee appointed to assist Lord Cecil, particularly in view of the fact that. the Council Committee is to meet in less than a fortnight. Please advise meanwhile whether the Interdepartmental Committee recommendation could be cabled here for consideration.&quot;   (Ends.)[Secret Telegram No. 127.] III.Copy of a Telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated November 23, 1925.(Confidential.)Your telegram of 18th November.Prime Minister advises me to reply that, while the New Zealand Government warmly appreciates the opportunity to associate itself in the work of the Inter-departmental Committee intended to be set up to determine what course should be adopted at the meeting of the Council of the League in connection with Disarmament proposals, it does not desire to appoint a representative on such Committee.[Secret Telegram No. 128.] IV.Copy of a &quot;Telegram from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated Nooember 23, 1925.(Priority.)(23rd November.

CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,   1 4 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty?s Government&apos;] &apos;Printed for the Committee, of Imperial Defence.   December 1925.SECRET. Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from DRAFT Minutes of 20C)lh Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, held on November SO, 1925.(1.) REDUCTION AND  LIMITATION  OF  ARMAMENTS.(C.I.D. Paper No. 649-B.)(Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of 205th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments (C.I.D. Paper No. 649-B).LORD CECIL stated that he had nothing to add to the Report, which was divided into three separate headings The composition, powers and procedure of what had been termed the Preparatory Committee for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments; the programme which should be submitted to that Committee as a basis for study; and the control of manufacture of arms by private firms. He proceeded briefly to outline the recommendations contained in the Report. With regard to Naval disarmament, his Committee was of opinion that no discussion should take place unless the United States of America was willing to participate and that the British Representative should intimate that the Conference would best be held at Washington. He thought it possible, however, that the other Powers might represent that naval disarmament should also be considered by the Preparatory Committee. Such a proposal was.not wholly disadvantageous from our point of view; for example, the reduction or abolition of submarines might possibly be brought about as part of the general bargain whereby those Powers who desired strong armaments on land would be granted wider latitude in return for a reduction or the abolition of submarines.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN considered that it would be unwise to press a general invitation to the United States of America unless the League knew beforehand that the United States would be agreeable to receive such an invitation. Should an offensive reply be received from. Russia to an invitation it did not very much matter, but it would not be advisable for the League to do anything, especially at the instigation of the British Representative, which might prove to be distasteful to the United States of America. He suggested that the League should enquire unofficially how an invitation would be received by the United States of America before putting forward any such invitation officially. If Lord Cecil would keep the Foreign Office informed on this point that Department would instruct Sir Esme Howard to approach the American administration at the proper time.Mr. BRIDGEMAN stated that arrangements should be made to ensure that there would be ample time for the Departments concerned to consider any recom-mendations that were being put forward before these were officially confirmed bv the Assembly.LORD CECIL undertook to bear this point in mind, but remarked that he did not anticipate that there would be any important decisions at the present stage.SIR SAMUEL HOARE urged that any attempts at disarmament should be limited entirely to peace-time armaments.   Any endeavours to probe, into the war capacity of individual Powers would, he felt convinced, only lead to a sea of [13887-1]
difficulties from which it would be difficult to emerge. Further, in regard to air armaments, it was important that we should not be pushed into accepting the present position as a basis or comparison. We were still at the present time in an inferiority of one to three as compared to the French; and, lastly, any consideration of air armaments should be confined to the metropolitan forces and should exclude units stationed in the Colonies.Mr. AUSTEN1 CHAMBERLAIN considered that no reduction of French air armaments could be effective so long as those stationed in Algeria and Morocco were excluded. Having regard to the mobility of aircraft and the short distance separating these Dependencies from France, these Colonial squadrons were to all intents and purposes part and parcel of the French metropolitan air forces.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD stated that the Air Ministry were prepared to accept the danger involved at the present time by any attempt of the French to bring back their Air squadrons from Morocco, so as to simplify the issue as far as possible. If, however, the French deliberately increased their Air forces in Morocco in order to circumvent any agreement for reduction in metropolitan Air forces, the matter would have to be reconsidered.LORD BALFOUR stated that he was uneasy in his mind about the whole question. The great majority of the problems stated in the Report were, in his opinion, quite insoluble, and it was quite clear that if at Geneva it was decided to investigate the problem of disarmament on the lines suggested, that we should, at some time or another, be forced to give answers to the questions that we had set. Was it possible for us to give reasonable answers to any of them ? He felt that we were going into this question without any idea of how we were ultimately going to get out of it. He noticed that the question of the abolition of conscription had been placed last on the programme on account of its inherent difficulty. He suggested that for this very reason it should appear first on the programme so that the difficulties involved should be realised at the very outset.LORD CECIL thought that Lord Balfour had adopted a somewhat pessimistic view. He agreed that it was impossible to alter the ultimate strength which any nation was capable of producing in time of war, but it was possible, by imposing a limitation on peace-time armaments, to reduce the chances of a knock-out blow being delivered at the very outset of-hostilities. That was, he thought, the most that could be hoped for, but it was at the same time a great advance. He did not anticipate that the French would say that they were quite unable to reduce their armaments as a result of the Locarno Treaties; he thought their own internal situation would demand that some progress should be made in this direction. Further, Germany&apos;s armaments had been reduced as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, which had definitely stipulated that Germany&apos;s disarmament was a prelude to general disarma-meht. If France refused to disarm now, then she would be unable morally to insist on German disarmament being continued. The French, he thought, fully realised the significance of this point.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN considered that we had no alternative but to approach the problem in the manner which had been suggested. This method of approach was alien to the English temperament, and no Englishmen would naturally approach the problem in this manner; the Latin races, however, worked on strictly logical lines. No doubt as a result they suffered from revolutions and accomplished less effective work, but in this particular instance we could not do otherwise than conform. It would be for Lord Cecil to see how he could reduce abstract discussions into practical results, and he could impress on the French the strength of the juridical argument which Germany would put forward on the question of disarmament based on the Treaty of Versailles.LORD BALFOUR enquired whether the opinion was held that abstract discussion on disarmament would further goodwill towards disarmament.LORD CECIL thought that discussion was a good thing. Even if no useful results could be hoped for from the adoption of the procedure outlined, he thought, nevertheless, there was an advantage in putting disarmament to use an American expression &quot; on the map.&quot;Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN thought that Lord Cecil might with advantage call attention ot the procedure which was adopted at Washington, and might intimate that we wrere at any time prepared to make proposals in regard to a limitation of
cruisers, &amp;c, and that it was for the large land Powers to come forward with like proposals in regard to land armaments.Mb. AMERY was of opinion that we were Bound to go into this question of disarmament with goodwill and that it would be a great mistake for us to put forward the most difficult aspect of the problem in the first instance. He thought&apos; 1 that a discussion on disarmament would be helpful. He also pointed qut that, Jjie &apos;: Dominions were interested in the matter, and that Canada, in particular, had asked that the recommendations of Lord Cecil&apos;s Committee should be communicated to them.LORD CAVAN asked that it might not be overlooked that we had reduced our military expenditure by over  20,000,000 in the last six years. Without appearing self-righteous, we were entitled to ask other nations to follow our example.Mb. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he was somewhat uneasy on the question of the private manufacture of arms. Control in this direction would result in the creation of a large number of Government arsenals in countries which were at present dependent on outside sources of supply. Whereas we would conform to any agreements into which we entered on the subject of control, some other countries would not do so. He thought, therefore, that any proposal to the effect that nothing but Government arsenals should be sanctioned would result in the piling up of large warlike materials in small countries.LORD CECIL agreed, but pointed out that President Wilson had included this point in the Covenant, and that we were, therefore, bound to cope with it. He thought that even the most extreme advocates did not propose the abolition of private armament firms, but merely the institution of a system of licences. The difficulty was that steps had been taken to control traffic in arms, and, therefore, there was a strong argument that something should be done to control those countries who made their own armaments.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that, in accepting the Report, the Committee might a*dd a recommendation, based on Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s proposal, that one of the land Powers should be urged to come forward with proposals for land disarmament.Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN considered that Lord Cecil should bear this point in mind, and, if opportunity offered, should urge in private that one of the big land Powers should come forward with a definite proposal.LORD CECIL stated that he would not be present at the Cabinet when the Report of the Committee of Imperial Defence was under consideration. He had mentioned this point to the Prime Minister, who had agreed that he should accept the proceedings of the Committee of Imperial Defence as his authority, and that if subsequently the Cabinet made any alteration further instructions would be telegraphed to him.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed  (i.) That the Report of the Sub-Committee on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments (C.I.D. Paper No. 649-B) should be forwarded to the Cabinet with a general expression of the Committee&apos;s approval, and that, pending confirmation by the Cabinet the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be authorised to base his attitude at the meeting of the Committee of the League of Nations at Geneva thereon, (ii.) That the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should, during the proceedings of the above Committee, keep carefully in mind the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the most hopeful method of bringing about limitation and reduction of armaments would be to follow the Washington precedent; that Lord Cecil should have authority, if he thought desirable, to state that Great Britain would be ready at the proper moment to make a proposal in regard to cruisers, &amp;c, and to suggest that some great land Power might take the initiative in regard to land and air armaments.
(iii.) That it would be undesirable for the League of Nations to. approach the United States of America directly with a view to their participation in the League&apos;s enquiry into reduction and limitation of armaments without first ascertaining informally whether a formal invitation would be welcomed. That this informal sounding had best be done by the League itself through its own channels. That the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should keep the Foreign Office informed of what was being done by the League with a view to appropriate action by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(iv.) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be authorised to communicate the Report of the Sub-Committee on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments (OLD. Paper No. 649-B) to the Dominion Governments, and that the Secretary of State for India should be authorised to take similar action with regard to the Government of India if he so desired. * * * * * *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, November 30, 1925.
