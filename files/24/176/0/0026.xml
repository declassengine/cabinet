4 9 QC 0 A L.SIR ADAM NIMMO recalled that at the last meeting of the Council he indicated that although the situation was extremely had in the coal Industry there were some evidences at that time that the lowest point had been reached, and that things were steadying themselves to some extent.     He thought there were increasing evidences that the position was then correctly Indicated,      There appeared to be a better feeling in the industry all round at the present moment, although of course the financial results were extremely bad,      It seemed to be true to say that we appeared to have got down to the economic level of prices and that trade was expanding,  and more sales taking plaoe.     From the figures of output which the Council had before them on the table  (see Statistical Data at the end of these Notes) it would be observed that for some weeks the output had been rather better and the most recent export figures would probably exhibit the same tendency.      One significant feature Indicating that our prices were now becoming more attractive was this, that while we had had information at first hand from the representatives of the Russian Government here some, months ago that they had no. Intention of buying coal from this country for at least five years, they had within the last fortnight, as was generally known, bought a fair quantity of coal from the North East Coast.    This indicated that the Russian Government were now finding It to their advantage to purchase at any rate some British coal.The subsidy,, Sir Adam thought, would be at its peak during the month of December, but it looked from the financial results which were materialising in some of the districts,   as if the load of the subsidy would be et any rate slightly lessened during the early months of 1926.Mr. Brand asked whether prices were dowi to an economic level apart from the effect of the subsidy, or because the subsidy had allowed them to be reduced?Sir Adam Nimmo replied that he believed the pr ice of British coal had had to come down to the world price owing to the general economic situation, and not owing to the subsidy.      The subsidy had, however, enabled many of the collieries to go on in spite of the lower prices, which other wise they would have been  -unable to do.IRON &amp;&quot; STEEL.MR. DORMAN said that the general iron and steel trade was a little better than it had been a month ago.    The production figures showed that there were slight increases in October over September, 136- furnaces were in blast now, which represented a net increase of seven compared with a month ago.      The production of iron was very consil erabiy less than before the war, but it was slowly improving. Exports had-1-
1 ri tl 1&amp;3CONFID SITIIAL * IRON AND STEEL (OONTD,),Increased quite considerably during October, but imports still remained at a very high level.   Pig Iron prioes were more stabilised, as makers generally, owing to the anticipated increase in the price of coke, seemed to be getting a little tired of selling at a loss, and were agreeing to some extent to fix a minimum price,   America was buying a little iron, - not enough to make any real difference, although it was an acceptable assistance.   Steel prioes were also more uniform, following on the efforts of the makers to stabilise them,.During the last few months consumers had been kept off buying because the fluctuations were downward, and they thought that by waiting they might get more favourable terms. Probably they realised now that there was not much object in waiting any further, because many of the quotations had been lower than the cost of manufacture, and it should be borne in mind that the range of prioes today was only a bare SO per cent, over the pre-war level, a lower rate probably than that of almost any other commodity,   A few orders were being booked, but makers were finding a difficulty as to how to quote for delivery after the end of April, because, of course, coal entered very largely into their costs.    There was more plant in operation.   The firm of Dorman, Long and Company started a large steel works last month, which was easing the position of unemployment a little in the Middlesbrough district.The   wire trade, unfortunately, was very dull Indeed, Inquiries were falling off, and continental makers, especially the Germans, seemed to be obtaining the bulk of the orders in the market.   The galvanised sheet trade was astonishingly goodj makers were all booked up, largely to the end of the first quarter of next year.    In constructional engineering most firms were fairly well off for work, and the position was fairly satisfactory,.As to the fear which had been expressed that the slump in the franc might lead to a further reduction In French quotations in our market, it had to be remembered that it was Belgium   .&apos;. whloh had always been the chief continental supplier Of seml-* finished material to this market, and Belgium had been labouring under difficulties for the past few months owing to a partial strike,SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote on November 24th -&quot;Regarding the trade position, I am sorry to say that there has been a decided falling off in the l&amp;recommendation fourteen days, just as there was last year about this time,&quot;The better class trade, Crucible Steel, High Speed Steel and drills, is keeping up fairly well, but the bulk material, which keeps the mills and forges occupied, is not coming forward at all.&quot;My own view is that it is entirely a question of price, and it Is going to be very difficult indeed to get a steady, progressive improvement in trade, at to-day^ prices.
ENGINEERING: GENERAL.SIR GLYNN WEST desired to support what Mr. Dormant had said about the difficulty of the Heavy Steel Industry, in giving quotations for forward orders, for delivery during next year. The situation had been made easier owing to the price of coal, but no one knew how long that, was going to last. With regard to other Engineering, there appeared to have been a decided imorovement in the last month or two. The Motor Industry, as Sir G. West had said at a previous Council meeting, had a distinct bearing upon the general situation because there was no doubt that they were very busy, and when they were busy there was immediately a demand for tool steel and machine tools, and to a certain extent even structural steel, because many people make extensions. There seemed to be an improvement in the ordinary demand for Engineering. Enquiries wer. coming along a little better. Shipbuilding, of course, had been getting a little relief from the Trade Facilities Scheme, and that equally benefitted to a certain extent Marine Engineering.. But it was not con-sidered that those Industries were really naturally improving. The locomotive Industry was going to derive benefit from the Railway Companies ordering considerable quantities of rolling stock: some of this would be manufactured in the Railway Companies1 own locomotive shops, but of course from a national and an employment point or view that did not matter. -t-CONFIDENTIAL.IRON AND STEEL (CONTD).&quot;Fundamentally, it is a question of the cost of living, and the cost of coal and transport,  and until there is an alteration in these three main items, it is going to be very difficult indeed to do a steady export trade.&quot;The present situation has created great disappointment, as there were real signs of a steady improvement up to two or three weeks ago.&quot;MR   BAKER wrote:-&quot;There appears to be a more&apos; optimistic feeling in the trade at the present time then there has been for 3ome months past.&quot;Messrs. Dorman, Long&apos;s Aoklam Steel works hag resumed activities after months of idleness and that firm are erecting a large new Depot in connection with their constructional engineering and bridge building department at Newport, Middlesborough.&quot;The United Steel Companies&apos; rail mill at lorkington has been re-started as the result of an order for 15,000 tons of rails.&quot;There are now 37 blastfurnaces in operation in the Cleveland area as compared with 32 at the close of September, and more manufactured iron and steel was exported from the Tees in October than in any other month      th i s ye ar .&quot;The Staveley Coal and Iron Company are re-lighting a blast furnace at their Devonshire works at Staveley, and they propose to demolish two obsolete blastfurnaces and build in their place a furnace of the most modern type with treble the capacity for the production of pig-iron.&quot;The export of pig-*iron during October amounted to 50,434 tons as compared with 27,034 tons in September, and 44,548 tons in January this year, which was the previous highest figure reached for the year,&quot;The export of galvanised sheets during October reached 66,572 tons, the nearest approach to that figure for any other month this year being the export for March, which amounted to 65,351 tons.&quot;&quot;At the Tees Ironworks of Messrs. Pease and Sons two furnaces have been relit after being idle for twelve months.&quot;The Barrow Steelworks is in full operation again&quot;.
CONFIDENTIAL.ENGINEERING. ELECTRICAL.SIR HUGO HIRST stated that the eleotrioal industry continued in a satisfactory condition.    Comparing it month by month from January to the present time there had been an average increase in each month of at least 7l- per cent, in total output, and he thought that employment showed a similar percentage of increase.   As regards home business in particular, something of a crisis in the wireless and broadcasting business might be expected within the next six months.    There had been a boom up to the present; and, owing to foreign importations and a great many unqualified people going into the business, a large overstocking had been the result.   A number of bankruptcies and failures would probably soon take place because the rate of progress had naturally stopped.   We were coming nearer to a time of steady business, and the surplus stocks and the speculators would suffer seriously.The industry were still experiencing disappointment at the slow progress which the railway companies were making with electrification.   liany manufacturers had prepared for a great deal of work in that direction, and for a time it seemed as if there was going to be great activity, but with the exception of the work on the Southern Railway very little was being done.   Another point, if it was right to raise it. was this.   We had all heard of the Weir Report.    Sir Hugo did not know that any manufacturers had been., consulted on the matter.   Anything arising out of it would affect them very closely, and they all felt that if they knew something about it beforehand, and could give helpful criticism before it got to the publio, this might be useful.   They were rightly anxious to know what was going to happen, because they would have to organise three or four years ahead, and as they knew nothing, they were hampered In their activities at the present time.As regards foreign       business it had been improving. Australia was still their best market, and India had consider-ably Improved.   The preference, however, which Australia ^,ve them was really no preference at all in some directions. Australia imposed an import duty of 35 per cent, on certain things; and, with a 10 per cent, preference, British manufacturers had to pay 25 per cent.   But as the duty is calculated on the price which is ruling in each exporting country, naturally if a British firm was competing with,  say, a Hungarian firm, 35 per cent, on their prioe was much less than 25 per cent, on our price, and it was a question whether something could be done so that the preference would be really as effective as it appeared to be on paper.TEXTILES:  COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN said that cotton spinners were still experiencing a serious loss in their margins, and this was now seriously reflected in the price of cloth.   Some figures had been taken out over a period of 12 months which showed that when there was a fall of 3-grd. a lb. in cotton there was a corresponding fall of 8d. a lb. in some     finished cloths, which showed a heavy cut into the margin on the manufacture of cloth.
TEXTILES: COTTON. ( CQl: TO.).American cotton was now on such, a basis that it could not possibly show any margin of profit to the grower, there was a   distinct loss to the spinner, there was a loss to the weaver, and yet, in spite of these three facts, the public still did not think the cloth was cheap enough to buy.     There was no question that the production of Lancashire is still in excess of the demand.As was no doubt known, a large section of the trade felt that the Master Cotton Spinners should insist on still shorter hours   being worked.     A ballot had been taken on the subject, and the ballot was not in favour of curtailing hours beyond 39i, which they are now running.       They are accordingly still running 39t hours.     The Fine section of the Trade, the Egyptian side, was fairly well maintained, and the Fine spinning mills were practically now running full time.     Lancashire was undoubtedly feeling tremendous competition, espeoially in coarser yarns and cloths, from Japan;     they were also feeling very seriously the continued unrest in China and In Smyrna.     Uhfortun-ately, in the case of China, although some cloth was getting through, the season for the purchase of the high-class China brocade for which Lancashire had had practically a monopoly for a century, had passed with hardly any orders being booked in Lancashire.     C^l. Seddon Brown felt he could not give any satisfactory report as regards the trade as a whole.MR JTJDSON observed that he had reported two months ago that the Egyptian section was worse than It had been for four or five years. He was glad to say we had got over that depression, and, as Colonel Seddon Brown had said, there was now a great Improvement in the Egyptian section.     But th*t was only 30 per cent of the whole trade.     An effort had been made to reduce the number of working hours from 39  to 35, and although they did not obtain the percentage   which was necessary for a reduction of hours, it was remarkable that nearly 75 per cent, of the trade voted In favour of reducing hours, showing the bad state of the trade.     The price of cotton was, as Colonel Seddon Brown had pointed out, about as low as the American grower could produce it at.   We should never get again what was known as 4d cotton, as it was when war broke out. It was now roughly 10d.j but for labour (which was the  -highest cost In the cotton field) the average wage used to be half a dollar a day, whereas when the war finished it was 1% dollars a day, and that rate had since been maintained.     We had not reached the stage yet when Empire-grown cotton had an appreciable effect an price, and we should not do so for many years to come.This year we had a record crop of 16,000,000 bales.     The record crop before the war was not more than 16,000,000 bales roughly the same        but yet that was based on a   55^ hour week worked in the trade, and there was a surplus left at the end of the season,     &apos;i&apos;here had been no appreciable Increase in the number of spindles working in the country, so that if there had been some cotton left   over with a 16 , 000,000 bales crop and a 55-1 working hour week, there was going to be a bigger carry over with 39t hours.     And if that was so, the South American was going out of business as far as cotton-growing is concerned, which   seant a bad effect on future cotton crops.     If the crop of 16,000,000 bales was to be reduced to one of 13,000,000 or 14,000,000 then we would have a high price for cotton again.
4   O Cti a aTEXTILES :___COTTON  (CONTD. ).SIR WILLIAM CLARE LEES said he thought the view would be accepted that the Cotton trade was not one trade, but a group of trades.    He had prepared a statement (reproduced at the end of this paragraph) in order to show the relative duty,  so to speak, which each section of that trade was carrying from the point of view of employment.      In the first column were stated the 1913 export figures, and sido by side with them equivalent figures were given, allowing for the reduction of 15 per cent, which had taken place in the hours of employment:    so wo got what wo might call the net expectancy in order to employ the same number of people.    In 1924 we found, giving the tolerance for linear yards, that the export of grey goods was only employing the equivalent of 69 per cent, as compared with 1913, bleached goods 81 per cent.., printed goods 69 per cent.,dyed goods 87 per cent., and coloured cottons,  that is goods made of yarn already dyed in tho piece,  74 per cent.    For 1925 the figures were actually a percentage for nine months,  but they were carried out to 12 months on the average of nine months.    There we found the grey1s position had fallen to 61,per cent, and Sir William suggested that this was a much more serious thing than even just the percentage would indioate, because we were losing business on what might be called the raw end of the trade.    Bleached goods, which used to be second, were now well ahead, with 89 per cent;    printed goods 77 per cent;    dyed goods 87.7 per dent., and coloured cottons 81.9.    So it seemed reasonable to suppose that if we were to benefit by cheaper cotton, bleached and dyed goods might be in sight of pulling their full 100 per cent, weight.    Prints, wero not quite so good, and ho did not think they would improve as much.    It would be seen that the yarn export was pulling 104 per cent, as compared with 1913, and probably from ah employment point of view (and perhaps CoLSeddon Brown would agreo that the tendency must have been for the counts to go finer in that period) the export of yarn was actually better than it was in 1913.    But unless means could be found to arrest the loss of our grey shirting trade, a very heavy permanent loss would be suffered in that direction; and, although Lancashire had made their gesture to India on the previous day (soe paragraph on &quot;Indian Trade&apos;1) which they did quite wholeheartedly and quite sincerely, there Was no doubt that the tendencywould be to make Japanese competition more difficult with the Indian mills in the coarsor counts, and it would force Japan to seek to compete with Lancashire in India a little higher up in the scale,- in grey shirting and so forth,-and the result might be rather to increase our ultimate loss.

i 9 rr it JTEXTILES s WOOL.MR. ANDREWS observed that in 1913 the value of a bale of wool was  13, a year ago It was  40, today it was  22.    It therefore now stood at 70 per cent, above the pre-war levels and the trade were of opinion that it was at an economic price.   From July to Ootober the French dominated prices, which rose 10 per cent.   During the greater part of that period the franc was at about 102 to 104.   During November the franc&quot;fell to 130, and now stood at about 124; this appeared to have killed the French demand.   They were no longer able to operate in any large quantity In raw material. We knew, of course, that the situation would assist them in dumping their finished goods in this market, but for the moment one could say that England had taken the place of France in dominating wool prices, and we had been able to get them down, by the 10 per cent that the French had put them up. The raw material at a reasonable price was always of great assistance to the trade .Mr. Sutcliffe Smith (see next paragraph) had mentioned that these had been a slight increase in unemployment during the last few weeks.   Mr. Andrews thought it was entirely due to the shipping strike in Australia, and that within a short time that increase vould disappear.   As a matter of faot if one compared the figures today with those for July and took the whole of the industry into account, it might be found that the unemployment figures had dropped by something like 50/ , which of itself was certainly encouraging.   The combing and spinning branches of the trade were certainly better,  (though not better perhaps than they were a month ago). but this was very largely on account of the more satisfactory condition of the hosiery trade in Leicester, It was not so much on account of any improvement in the weaving trade in Bradford with which Mr. Sutcliffe Smith deals.   Mr.Andrews could not see any improvement there.   However, he thought there was a better feeling all round, and they could see indications of better trade in January and February.   The best thing of all was that they had got wool down to an economic price level.TEXTILES: WORSTED. ETC,MR. SUTCLIFFE SMITH observed that the trade was still rather dull, and being done from hand to mouth, though there were a fair number of enquiries for novelties.   The situation could not be considered healthy by any means because the rise in the price of wool had created a certain amount of hesits-t!M*8 on the part of buyers, and a good many were holding off until they heard the decision of the Safeguarding Inquiry.   The spinners had had improved trade in the last few weeks in Botany and Crossbred   but not in Mohair,    Only about 50 per cent, of the spindles in Mohair were working,  as against 60 or 70 per cent, of other spindles.   The manufaturers-turing section was not making much progress, as 53 per cent, of the looms were running on full time, 40 per cent, were idle, and 7 per cent were on short time. It was an en-ecouraging feature, however, that the retail trade was showing a little more interest in British goods, though the prospect as a whole was not very bright, and would not be till things become more settled. But, generally speaking, there might be said to be a decidedly better feeling.
TEXTILES :   WORSTED. ETC. (CONTD.)The export side of the trade was not very good.     Trade with China was unsettled,  that with the Strait Settlements was more activej   Japanese orders this year were not as good as last year, the Near East was very disappointing:   there was a fair business in South and Central Amerioa, and a steady demand from the Dominions, except Australia, where it was now their quiet season,where was rather a retrograde movement in the figures of total unemployment and short time, which amounted to 9,980-this was for Bradford and district ** against the two previous weeks of 9,642 and 9,625,POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS thought there seemed to be some indication that in the pottery trade they were getting back to something like normal conditions as regards receiving orders.   Before the war the export trade was usually busiest in the spring and autumn, and the home trade prior to Christmas and during the summer holidays.   That went by the board during the war period and up to 1920, but the Indications now pointed to a return to that condition of things.   The China trade had improved its position during the last month.   They had prospeots of fairly good Christmas business.     There was an interesting point on the Board of Trade Returns   with regard to our exports to the United States.    While there had been a fall in the last ten months of 6,000 tons in weight, as compared with the corresponding period last-year, the diminution in values was as much as  100,000. These exports were again consisting more of the plain white stuff which we used to send to Amerioa,  and that meant that the value of our exports to that country had decreased although the bulk was pretty much the same.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE WHOLESALE SOCIETY.MR, GALLACHER stated that the recent cold weather had had   an appreciable effect on sales of heavy drapery goods and on the heavy boot trade, but still his Society^ figures showed &amp; deorease in these directions.   That was to be attributed to some extent to the strike of shale oil miners in the East of Scotland,   The Wholesale Society had a Show recently of Spring and Summer goods and found that the Retail Societies were not buying very freely.   This lack of forward buying was no doubt due to the uncertain prospeots of trade in general,   The position at the moment was that the whole of the trade of the Wholesale Society for the last 21 weeks of the current six months showed only an increase of about 2 per cent, - an inoreaBe of  129,000 on  6,000,000.
CONFP ENTIAL. SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE ,&apos;IHOLESALB 30C IETY. (contd.),In connection with the cost of living, Mr. Gallacher had &quot;been supplied with some figures additional to those which he had furnished to the Council previously. These further figures, he thought,    were very illuminating with regard to three main articles of diet,  sugar, tea and butter. For 1923 the average price of fine sugar was 56s. 6d. per cwt. over a period of 24 weeks beginning in July and going on to the end of November, The duty on that was 25s. 8d., showing a net price of 30s, lOd.    In 1924 the average price of sugar per cwt. was 37s.3d., with duty 11s.8d., showing a net price of 25s.7d, In 1925 for the same period the average price was 29s.3d., duty again 11s.8d.,  showing a net price of 17s.7d.    That wag very near to the pre-war price of sugar which ranged about 15s.. or 16s. per cwt. -12th tea there had been a distinct advance in price.    In 1923., again taking the last five months of the year, the average wholesale price of the Society&apos;s best quality tea was 2s.8d9J duty 8d., net price 2s. In 1924 it was 2s.4ld., duty 4d., net price 2s.Old. In 1925 it was 23.7^. duty 4d., net price 2s.3fd.   As to butter, in 1923, again taking the last 22 weeks of the year., the average wholesale price of best Danish butter was 193s. per cwt, in 1924 it went up to 223s. per cwt., in 1925 it fell to 220s.6d. In 1923 the highest price was 223s., in 1924 224s., and in 1925, at one point it touched 243s., but only for a short period. There had been a distinct upward movement in the price of butter since 1923.   This, it was understood, was to be attributed to the entrance of Germany and the Continent into the Danish market.GENERAL TRADE..MR. MACHIN considered that the improvement which was generally reported at the last meeting of the Council had since been maintained. The improvement was nothing remarkable, but no doubt could be felt in view of reports received from various parts of the country, that greater confidence prevailed and that a greater volume of business was generally being done. The Council were, of course, glad to hear Sir Adam Nimmo&apos;s more hopeful report in connection with the Coal Industry. But here was.the one great cloud on the horizon.    No one could say what the outcome of the Royal Commission would be, or what might happen when the position had to be faced. ,If that element of doubt and uncertainty could be removed it would probably assist more than anything else to stimulate trade and produce that state of affairs for which we all hoped.Sir Adam had referred also to trade with Russia. Now there was certainly in this country, among those who were competing with Russian traders, a considerable uneasiness owing to the fact that Russia was sending to this market in sub-stantial quantities,  at lower rates than could be charged by other people, the products of mines and forests which had been confiscated from their British owners. These British subjects were now having their market upset by goods which were being sent here from factories and works which were rightfully their own.
GENERAL TRADE AND BANKING.MR. TEENANT handed In reports from the tranches of the Westminster Bank dealing with general trade. (Extracts from these are given at the end of this paragraph).   He said that they appeared on the whole to bear out what the Council had heard that morning.     Mr. Tennant thought that, speaking broadly, trade showed some further improvement over the already fairly favourable situation which had been reported at the Council&apos;s last meeting.     There were, of course, however, some exceptionally depressed industries, which constituted exceptions to this general tendency to improvement.frith regard to the money market, there had been a great demand for money all through the month, but the distribution of the dividend on the uiar Loan on the 1st December had made the market much easier during the last day oi&quot; so.   There had been issues of trustee stocks during the month to the amount of 17-g- millions, and most of them had been absorbed.     Tne net efflux of gold since the establishment of the gold standard had been  9,200,000. The principal event In the market had   been the depreciation of the French franc which at one time went to 130, but, on the day before, had gone back to 120.WESTMINSTER BANK:      BRANCH REPORTS.EXTRACTS.AGRICULTURE.Reports for the past month showed that farmers had been able to make good progress since the harvest was gathered, and satisfactory work had been accomplished in weeding and tillages, preparatory to the planting of winter cereals. Seed   sown had germinated rapidly, under the favourable weather conditions, and was in many cases well through and looked pi-omising.As regards present crops, wheat was generally dearer, the advance being ascribed in part to decreased supplies from Australia as a result of the shipping strike.     Trade in oats was slow, and prices remained stationary.   Barley was selling badly, the home produce being  subject to severe competition from foreign imports from many countries.      In some districts, all classes of corn were selling at prices below the cost of production, and on this account it seemed probable that more arable land would go down to grass.     Hay was plentiful, but was a dull market.Sugar beet was lifted in several areas.      It has been largely an experimental crop and appears generally to have done well, especially when planted on a light soil and given the advantage   of a long growing season.     A fair profit is anticipated, and farmers regard this new venture hopefully, Px-oduction this year is estimated at 450,000 tons, against 130,000 tons last year.
WESTMINSTER BANK;    BRANCH REPORTS  (Oontd.). EXTRACTS (OoNTD.).HOSIERY.With the advent of colder weather, orders for hosiery-showed a decided improvement.    It was evident that wholesale warehouses had been carrying only small stocks, and as a result sudden pressure was experienced by manufacturers, who, in some oases, were unable to execute orders within the limited time allowed for delivery.At Derby, heavy and medium knitted underwear was in demand. Makers of fancy hosiery at Leicester reported a paucity of orders, and were concentrating on new designs for Spring goods. Trade in artificial silk hose was generally poor, and was not expected to revive until the Spr*ing.Export business was reported to be good, with the New Zealand market outstanding for all classes of knitted    goods. Satisfactory orders were also received from other Dominions, for delivery early next year, whilst there were indications of an improvement in the near future in business with the United States.LEATHER AND BOOTS .Slightly bettor conditions prevailed as a rule -throughout the past month. Tanners, howevor, found the strength of the hide market an obstacle to forward buying. Their stocks were low,  but they could not purchase extensively, at existing prices, for replacement purposes. There was a greatly decreased call for common and medium grades of sole bends, and the better-class qualities were in request for manufacturing purposes. &apos; The new Wellington boots for ladios continued to be in favour and were responsible for large requirements of upper leathers, and better class offals were again in considerable demand. The export branch of the leather trade continued satisfactory,  the United States and Canada being prominent buyers.A steady improvement for boots and shoes was registered. As regards the better grade of goods, however, there was no greater demand than during last month, although very tempting lines were offered for next season&apos;s trade. Such business as was put through was for early delivery, and bookings of any bulk for next year were difficult to negotiate.&apos;MOTOR AND CYCLE TRADES.Motor Cars-.    Business at Coventry remained generally good, particularly in the light car section. In most cases, manufacturers had arranged to increase their output beyond the records of last season, and as the overseas markets showed a continuous tendency to broaden, it was confidently hopod that the increased production would be absorbed without difficulty.    In commercial vehicles, the slight improvement noted in recent months for further marked, and local makers reported better enquiries than for several years past. At Birmingham the present position and outlook was considered quite satisfactory.    Export trade expanded,  success having been achieved in several continental markots which have scarcely been touched lately by British makers, notably Russia and Hungary.
Motor Cycles.    Maters at Birmingham and Coventry experienced inoreased demand for their products from the Continent, and also from India and the Far East,    Bristol reported the outlook as very promising.    Trade, as a whole, continued very active with heavy deliveries for the  time of year.Pedal Cycles.   Well-known makers at Coventry experienced little difficulty in disposing of their output; there was, however, no pressure of business.    Figures of exports of pedal cycles and parts thereof continued to show expansion month by month.SHIPBUILDING.Several small contracts are known to have been placed on the Tyne.

CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPPING  (CONTD.) .&quot;Shipowners consider that the International Sanitary-Conference should investigate this aspect of the matter before committing themselves to compulsory fumigation, and should also take into account the fact that the best of all ways of eliminating rats on board ship is to prevent them getting there by keeping them down on the docks.&quot;RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB said that the railway receipts for 47 weeks ended 27th November showed a decrease of  3,628,000over those of the corresponding period of last year j that meant, afbout 2 per cent less.    Passenger receipts were about 1 per cent, less, and freight receipts about 3 per cent less: taking the two together, it amounted to about 2 per cent, less.   As regards traffics, the latest figures available were those for September.   The total tonnage carried was 2,600,000 tons less than In the same month last year. Of this tonnage coal, of course, accounted for by far the greater part.   Coal was 2,400,000 tons less than for September last year - a decrease of 14 per cent.   The decrease of traffic as a whole was 9.3 per cent.    That also was comparing September with September. If one compared the first 9 months with the corresponding period last year, the decrease was less, about 6,8 per cent, so that September was relatively a worse month than the average of the year to date.   Passenger receipts for September were also a good deal worse than those In September 1924, showing a decrease of over half a million.    The total number of passenger journeys, apart from the London Tube and District Railways, in September was less by over 6 per cent, the receipts were less by 8 per cent, but the train mileage was considerably more, showing that the Companies were running a better service but carrying fewer people,As regards mineral traffic in September, ironstone and iron ore were less by 20 per cent, than in September, 1924. Limestone, which was mainly for the Steel Industry, was less by 13 per cent. Pig iron showed a decrease of over 6 per cent; iron and steel a slight Increase, namely 1,6 per cent. Generally, outside the building trade, all traffic showed a decrease as compared with September, 1924.UNEMPLOYMENT,MR. PHILLIPS said that the unemployment returns continued to reflect what  seemed to be a fairly general improvement. During November the total of registered unemployed fell by about 58,000, and at the end of that month it stood at 1,174,500 which was the lowest so far reached this year, with the exception of one week at the beginning of April. It was 16,000 below the total for the end of November last year.   Taking the figures for the end of October
UNEMPLOYMENT (oontd,).and oomparing them with   September, there was found to be a substantial improvement in ooal, iron and steel, tin-plates, cotton, wool, hosiery and textiles generally, and in the boot trade.   Shipbuilding and marine engineering were even worse than previously.   In most other trades there was either very little ohange compared with September or a slight improvement. The trade which bulked largest in improvement was coal, but to some extent no doubt that had to be discounted owing to the special circumstances.FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD,MR. BRAND referred, firstly to the French position.   Prices were rising in France, and the franc was, as the mark used to be, under-valued abroad.   Prioes had hot reached internally the level they should have to equal prices abroad.   The French floating debt was the great problem at the moment.   Call money rates in Paris now were 9 or 9^ per cent. Belgium was, of oourse, making tremendous efforts to stabilise, and she was being very muoh handicapped by the great fall in the French franc   The Belgians were buying considerably from Franoe and naturally the burden on the Belgian Treasury became greater; but it appeared that they had now every reason to think that they would carry through the stabilisation scheme, although a good many Belgian industrialists thought it might have a rather seriouB effect on Belgian industry for the time being, equivalent to the view in this country about the gold standard. In Germany discount rates for fine bank bills had fallen from 7^ or 7f to about 6f per cent.   Overdraft rates were much&apos; higher.   The Germans were still suffering greatly from scarcity of capital; there - seemed to be more bankruptcies now taking place in Germany and a good many of the big concerns were finding it extremely difficult to keep liquid at all.    The price of shares was still downward.    At the end of October, of the shares of companies quoted on the Stock Exchange in Berlin, only about 15 per cent, of the shares of German companies stood above par; and about 87 or 68 per cent, of them stood under 75 per cent, of par, showing how very low the price of shares was now in Germany.     There did not seem to be a likelihood of any early rise In these prices because of the great scarcity of capital.    In the United States, as far as could be seen, the industrial position showed no sign of inflation or boom.    It was purely a Stock Exchange boom at present.    Information from the United States went to show that the New York rate was not going up unless something exceptional took place.   Of course it had gone up in the other American centres.    That appeared to be due to a considerable extent to the desire to keep money from flowing to New York, and to keep it in different centres.   Loans for Stock Exchange purposes still continued to Increase and of oourse had reaohed an enormous figure now. . It was therefore impossible to say there would not be a big fall of prices on the Stock Exchange, but apparently we need not look at present for a rise in the New York rate.
AUSTRALIAN    TRADE.MR. SANDERSON observed that the termination of the shipping strike was one bright feature in Australia at the moment. The recent rains there had greatly improved the outlook, particularly In the wheat areas.    Further rain was still required in the pasture areas, which in some of the States were still suffering from drought, and on whether the rains oame or not would depend the production of wool during the coming season. The estimated wheat yield was 115,000,000 bushels, which was 50,000,000 bushels less than last year; and an exportable surplus of about 65,000,000 bushels was expected.    The figures at this time of year, however, were always very tentative.    The butter production was likely to be larger in   New South &quot;Wales and Queensland, and in Victoria it had been exceedingly good. Most of the Queensland meat works were closed till February or March, and although a good deal of rain had fallen on the coastal districts the western districts, which was the area from which the supply of cattle and sheep came, continued very dry.There were now available at Australia House copies of electrical wiring rules for the Commonwealth, as well as of specifications issued by the Engineering Standards Association in regard to railway rails and fish-plates, structural steel and portland cement, also of tentative Australian standard methods of sampling and analysis of plain steels, alloy steels, and pig-iron.Something had been said that morning about sultanas, and currants from Australia.   Although it was recognised that that particular industry in its present stage was a relatively very small amount of the total trade of Australia-, the fact wSfrs that sincethe War a great many returned soldiers had been put on to the land, which had been specially prepared for growing dried fruit, and every possible effort was being made. So far as quality and condition was concerned it was thought that these fruits compared favourably with those from elsewhere. The present difficulty lay rather in the small amount which was being produced, and In the price.INDIAN    TRADE.&apos;      TINDSAY, referring to the abolition of the Indian Cotton Excise Duty, remarked that those who had had experience of the administration of the duty knew what a curse it had been and were thankful it had now disappeared.   The statement published here by the National Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations showed a very gsnerous appreciation of tne position in India and would be very warmly welcomed In India as an indication of the attitude of British manufacturers.
INDIAN TRADE (Contd.)There had been some recovery in India&apos;s import trade during the past few months.     From 16 crores in June it had risen by gradual stages to 19l crores in October, which looked as if the exchange of over Is. 6d, was having its effect on imports.   Purchases of bullion had slightly inoreased but not by very much.   The announcement of the Finanoe Member that he was going to maintain the rate of is, 6 3/l6d, that is to say, that he would buy all his requirements at that rate, had had a very good effeot on trade in India.   It gave an assurance that exchange would not go up above that figure.;   it might go below, but this was not likely, in view of the good monsoon and export prospects.There seemed to be signs of a breaking up of the Swaraj Party,  and that was a result that was rather to be deplored.   It had been hoped that the Swaraj Party would continue and gain a sense of responsibility.     It had broken away from its old non-co-operation principles and its members were beginning one by one to aocept Offioe. But now that development seemed to have resulted in a definite split in the Swaraj party,  and we did not know what party was likely In the future to undertake the responsibilities, that,   it was hoped, would be undertaken by some definite Party In India.Mr. Wadia,  the Chairman of the Bombay Mill Owners&apos; Association, on his visit recently to this country, hoped to secure, and might be said to have secured, the alliance, so to speak, of the Lancashire mill owners;   and his programme was to work for the raising of the cotton Import Duties against, if not Japan by name,  at any rate against all foreign countries.   He was understood to have promised, so far as his Association were conoerned,  that whatever increase was made in the Import Duties it would not affect Lancashire.   The increase would be imposed on some such prinoiple as the Safeguarding of Industries duties,  that is to say,  it would apply to the products of all foreign countries but not to British goods.     In that there would be. no violation of our most favoured nation treatment clauses.Col. Seddon Brown doubted whether it oould be said that any definite arrangement had been come bo between Mr. Wadia and the Lancashire Federation,     He thought the result of their conversations was that the Bombay mill owners through Mr, Wadia, and the Lancashire mill owners, felt that they had a common competitor, almost a common trade enemy, in Japan. What the Bombay mill owners were prepared to do was to put no obstacle in Lancashire&apos;s way if the latter oould bring any influence to bear on the India Government to find some method of keeping out yarns from Japan and other foreign countries, which were produced under inferior labour conditions.
CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. R.J.H03E wrote:-&quot;In Argentina, the 3ale of woollen and cotton goods for the summer of 1926-27 commenced early last month, and it is gratifying that there has been     manifest a decided Increase in the sale of Manchester cotton goods. It is thought that next summer the bulk of cotton goods sold In Argentina will be of British design ard manufacture. British manufacturers have recently lowered their prices, while, on the other hand, Italian quotations have advanced. This latter circumstance, however, appears to be due to the fact that the Italian manufacturers, who are working night and day, have sold their complete output for many months ahead,  and are therefore not prepared to accept fresh orders at the very keen prices hitherto quoted. The worsted coating and woollen trades are only moderately active, and results so far obtained this season have not been very satisfactory. Nevertheless, It is believed that sales for next Spring and Summer goods will improve later, more especially as the recent hot weather experienced in the Republic has had the effect of depleting retailers&apos; stocks of light-weight woollens.   A slight increase has occurred in the gales of British woollen hosiery yarns, but the bulk of pur-chases of this commodity coxitinues to be made from the United States and the Continent. On the other hand,  the principal hardware firms express most optimistic views regarding the outlook and report that increasing preference is being shown for British lines. In general, prospects in Argentina are largely dependent upon the profitable marketing of this season&apos;s grain crops which until recently were reported&quot;to compare favourably with the record season of 1923-24. The news has been received of damage to growing crops by black rust in the Provinces of Cordoba and Santa Fe, although latest advices appear to Indicate that the damage is not so extensive as at first reported.&quot;A reaction has occurred In the Brazilian exchange during the past month, but,  so long as this movement is not too pronounced,  its effect upon the import trade should be favourable,  as the pause in the appreciation in the external value of the milreis should tend to facilitate the liquidation of stocks purchased at high prices. There is evidence that foreign competition is increasing, particularly from the United States, Belgium and Germany,  and the returns of Brazilian foreign trade in 1924 show that, in that year,  the United States displaced Great Britain by a small margin as the premier source of supply,  for the first time since 1921.&quot;The result of the General Election in Chile is very encouraging, cable advices Indicating that over 80 per cent, of the representative elected are those of the traditional parties as distinct from extreme Socialist interests. Moreover, not only is there now assured the re-establishment of a popular government, but also a majority of Senators representing the saner political element. General trade conditions in Chile are good, but the outlook will remain somewhat obscure until the vexed question of the Plebiscite in the Tacna and Arica Provinces is finally disposed of. There appears to have been some delay in the publication of the date of this Plebiscite and of the relative regulations, and the Chilean Delegation at Arica has therefore been instructed not to attend meetings of the Plebiscitary Commission until such details have been made known. The united States authorities undoubtedly find themselves in an embarrassing situation as arbitrators,  and,   although they have acted throughout in strict equity, there are already distinct signs of ^Fiction with the Chileans. Should this tension become more acute, it would constitute an unfavourable influence on any extension of commercial relations between Chile and the United States of America.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (oontd.).&quot;In the oourse of a previous report to the Council, I referred to the fact that a Decree Law had been signed by the Chilean President authorising the creation of the Banco Central de Chile,   An important feature of this Law is that it places the banks under an obligation to subscribe 10f* of their total capital and reserves to the new Banco Central,   A further General Banking Law has since been passed, which, inter alia, imposes upon the banks the necessity of maintaining a minimum ratio of oash to depoeitB in excess of that which has been oustoraary among native Institutions in the past.   The Chilean banks are therefore faced with a double call upon their funds, with a consequent depletion in the money to be used in their current business.   As far as is yet known, the Banco Central will oommenoe operations on 2nd January next, and the General Banking Law will become operative on 26th March.   A considerable degree of monetary stringency is therefore likely to ensue before thefundB thus immobilised again become available as a result of rediscounting operations under the new legislation. As a matter of fact, already one of the leading native banks which is known to have a large outstanding bad debt position, being faced with this potential demand upon Its already attenuated resources, has had to propose a scheme of reconstruc-tion.   7/hilst the mere fact of such difficulties stresses the necessity of legislation requiring liquidity among banks, it would not be surprising to those familiar with legislative procedure in Latin America to learn that the General Banking Law, although already signed, may be modified in some measure so as to bear less heavily Immediately on native institutions before it iB enforced in March next&quot;.TRADE IN CHINA.MR, LANDALS said that in the north of China business was muoh upset by troop movements and uncertainty as to the future. In Shanghai and the Yangtse things seemed to be better.    In the South conditions were still bad, but negotiations were going   on for a resumption of business between Hong Kong and Canton, following a deputation of Chinese merchants from Canton who came to Hong Kong last week.    It had not yet been possible to restart the piece goods auctions in Shanghai, but considerable business was being done privately.   The local cotton mills were now working satisfactorily.    There was also very little enquiry for China products such as oil seeds and vegetable oils, etc., owing to lower Indian prices.   Very good business in raw silk was being carried on.   Russia was buying both black and green tea in Hankow and Shanghai, at abnormally high prices considering prices ruling in London for similar quality - say, 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, higher, which was equal to about 2d. or 3d. per lb.    This had materially interfere.&quot; with the tea business from China to London, and It was estimated that the total exports to London for the present season would not exceed   7,000,000 lbs. against an export during last season of 27,500,000 lbs.In the recent mass movement of troops belonging to various contending parties in advance and retreat, the railways had suffered badly both physioally and financially, and were in a worse plight than ever.     The Peking Mukden Railway, owing to Its earnings having fallen to about half what was required to cover its operating expenses, was unable to remit the last
TRADE IH CHINA (oontd.).monthly instalment due 15th November against its loan service. The Tientsin Pukow Railway Supplementary Loan defaulted in its loan service as regards both principal and interest on the 1st November 1925.   The Shanghai Nanking Railway had not yet paid the one-fifth share due to net profit certificate holders for aooount of the year 1924.     The Shanghai Hangchow Ningpo Railway was in default in respect of instalment of principal due that day for payment 1st June, 1926.    The Canton Kowloon Railway had oeased functioning as a public service and its loan service due for payment to bond holders that day was in default.   All the railways were In a very bad state.
