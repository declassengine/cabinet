CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.IS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT.CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.   ,, STRIKE OP tV IRE LESS OPERATORS ON SHIPS.RET.7507(25 ). 1.        At the end of July. 1925, notice was given by the employers to the Association of Wireless and Cable Telegraphists that they wished to discuss a reduction in wages corresponding to the reduction pf all other ratings on board ship, which was due to come into operation at the beginning of August.       95 per sent   of the operators on board ship are employed by three firms, Marconi International Marine Communication Company, who employ the majority. The Radio Communications Company, and Siemens.   A few lines, such as the Union Castle, employ their own operators.   The wireless companies belong to the London and District Association of Engineering Employers, and accordingly the Chairman of that body conducts the negotiations on their behalf.    The Shipping Federation have as a rule also been represented. 2, Negotiations on -the question of a wage reduotionbegan in September and made little progress.    The Association wished to combine with them discussion on certain alterations in conditions, but were told that, in accordance with previous practice, those mast be dealt with separately.   At the end of October, no agreement on wages having been reached, the employers gave a month&apos;s notice of a reduction to come into operation on 1st December.    The present rates of salary are  8.17.6. per month, rising by yearly Increments to  20 per month in the 9th year.     The reduction of which notice has been given is 22/6 per month.
3.        Negotiations on conditions took place during October and November *   On November 24th,, the employers handed to the Association replies to the six points which they raised, making certain offers on some of them, and asking for further information on others.   These negotiations have been broken off ad the result of the Association having called the strike, and the employers have withdrawn their offers, 4,        In accordance with the rules made under the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Act, 1919, all ship owners are required to provide wireless apparatus and an operator, and are liable to prosecution if they do not comply with the requirements.   The Board of Trade issued instructions on 27th November to their Port Officers, that if they were satisfied that no operator was available,, a vessel should not be detained for failure to comply In this respeot.   The instructions add that the Board of Trade do not propose to take legal proceedings for failure to oarry a wireless operator while the present conditions obtain.   This Is similar to the action taken by the Board of Trade on the oaoasion of the last two strikes (in 1920 and 1922 ) and it of course exposes them to the accusation of taking sides with the employers. 5,        It may be mentioned that in September, 1924, the Union Interviewed the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade (Mr.A. V.Alexander) to ascertain what action the Board would take in the event of a strike.   He replied on the same lines, namely, that shipping could not be detained and trade be held up solely because wireless operators were not available.   This incident cannot be quoted in public. /-
6*     .  The Association of tireless and Cable Telegraphists claims to have 5,000 members.   Both the Union itself and most of its members are young, and they have a somewhat edited Idea of their importance.   For this reason they are unpopular among other seafarers, and were deliberately excluded, at the instance of Mr.Havelock tfilaon*s Union, from the machinery for fixing wages and conditions for seamen, etc.     The members of the Union are in a somewhat different position from that of most trade unionists who go on strike, in that the men employed by the wireless companies are paid whether they are on service or not.     A strike, therefore, put3 no pressure on the members or the Union as a whole, until they are dismissed by the firm.   The oompanies are now dismissing summarily all the men (from 300 to 400) who have refused to sign on under the new rates.   At least a week must, however, elapse before the Union begin to feel any serious pressure from the effects of the strike,7,        As seamen and other ratings have already suffered four months ago the reduction in wages which is now proposed for the wireless operators, and as the operators are generally unpopular, it Is not likely that any of the seamen&apos;s unions will take any sympathetic action at present.   There are a number of men who are prepared to take any opportunity of provoking a strike, but their recent memories of the seamen&apos;s strike can hardly be encouraging,6,        The Ministry of Labour are in touoh with the Union, the Engineering Employers&apos; Association, and the Shipping Federation,   The employers are not prepared and can hardly afford to make any concession on the question of wages.    They were prepared to meet the Union to a certain extent on the points which they raise with regard to conditions, but, having regard to the present frame of mind of the Union, a Joint Conference is more likely to be helpful if a few days are allowed to elapse.^ (Intd.)
