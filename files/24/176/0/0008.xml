CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1925. SECRET. Copt. No.-    3 (G.P. 509 (35).THE CABINET.TITHE BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The Lord Chancellor has called attention to the dissatisfaction of the Lay Tithe owners, including the colleges and some public schools, and he suggests that a possible solution would be the payment of the present rate, i.e.,  109 3s. lid., for 2 or 3 years, during which a Committee could consider final proposals.I should welcome a solution, but a postponement for a further Committee is not a solution.No one like? the Bill and every interest would claim a similar &quot; solution.&quot;The clergy wanted  100 net ; they are going to get  100 gross, which means probably  95, or perhaps  97 net.The tithe payers, vigorously supported by the truculent Farmers&apos; Union, say that.  100 gross is the maximum if tithe is to be stabilised, but some of these advocates say they prefer that tithe should continue to depend on the price of cereals (as in the 1836 Act), for then it varies in some degree with the price of their produce. If, however, they were taken at their word there would be an outcry from the majority.The Lay Tithe owners say that, if this Bill were not passed, their position would be that they would receive for the next three years gross payments of  131,  133 and  135 respectively, and that even after deducting half-rates at 10s. in the  l their net income would be  111,  113 and  115 respectively, and in any event they dislike stabilising which means guessing at the future values of cereals. They contend that the Government guess is all wrong and they prefer Professor Keynes&apos; forecast that the world price of cereals is more likely to rise than to fall. They add that history teaches us that the purchasing power of money constantly decreases, and they argue that they are likely to suffer both ways.Mr. Rawlinson and Lord Hugh Cecil supported their contentions with great force and vigour, accusing the Government of confiscation and robbery and of ignoring the rights of property. Lord Hugh Cecil claimed that the University of Oxford and some of its colleges would lose  60,000.It is true that for a short time the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge will receive a tithe lower by  5,000 a year, bat whether they will gain or lose over the period of 85 years for which the tithe is stabilised depends upon whether  105 turns out to be the true average value of tithe based on the formula of the 1836 Act. If  105 is too high, then the landowners and the farmers will pay too much. If, on the other hand,  105 is too low, then the tithe owners will receive too little, and the universities may have b.een &quot;robbed&quot; and part of their property may have been &quot;confiscated.&quot;The figure of  105 was fixed by the Cabinet Committee sitting under the chairmanship of Lord Salisbury, on the advice of Mr. Edward Wood, then Minister of Agriculture, who in turn was advised by Sir Charles Longmore after he had taken evidence from Professor Keynes and three experts.If the solution proposed by the Lord Chancellor is adopted the Committee would obviously have to reconsider the figure  105, and, if by any chance it came to the conclusion that, say,  100, or say  110, was the proper rate at which to stabilise the tithe, is it not clear that the new figure could not be fixed for Lay Tithe alone, but that if: a higher figure is adopted the owners of Clerical Tithe would also claim the higher figure, or that if lower the payers of Clerical Tithe would claim the lower figure ? This Bill would then have settled nothing, and the Government would have to begin again with a disastrous failure to their debit.CB25/17)   75   12/25   W.O.P.   2Ui
If the Committee fixed a higher figure, such as Professor Keynes suggests, it in-certain that the landowners, and especially the farmer-owners, will be unable to pay tithe. I will give one example which came to me from an Eton Master who pays tithe to Eton in respect of land in Norfolk,   The tithe to-day is 8s. an acre, the land is let at 10s. an acre, so that at 131 the tithe would be more than the rent.The land cannot stand even a few years of tithe at 131, and it: is, therefore, necessary that something should be done before the end of this year. The Bill which has passed the House of Commons is a fair compromise between conflicting interests. I venture to think there is no solution which will reconcile all views, and that there is as large a measure of agreement about this Bill as can be obtained for any Bill dealing with tithe. I therefore think that the amendment to be moved on behalf of Lay Tithe owners should be refused.L. W.-E.The War Office,1st December, 1.925.
