CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1925.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 602 (25).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON POLICY WITH REGARD TO IRAQ.REPORT.AT a meeting of the Cabinet held.on the 25th November, 1925 (Cabinet 53 (25), Conclusion 5), it was agreed : &quot; That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows : Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for the Colonies,Secretary of State for India,Secretary of State for Air,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,should meet to frame the declaration to be made to the Council of the League of Nations and the House of Commons respectively with regard to our policy in Iraq.&quot;The Committee met on the 27th November and discussed draft declarations submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. After a detailed examination of these drafts and amendments, which were suggested by various Members, the Committee agreed : That the policy of the Government should be stated to the House of Commons in the terms set forth below whenever the occasion for a statement arose, and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should take the statement as instructions for his guidance when representing the Government at the Council of the League of Nations.Terms of the Statement to the House of Commons.&quot; The undertaking we have given is not for a definite twenty-five years, but for what I believe, as the Secretary of State for the Colonies stated to the Council, will be a far shorter period, namely, until such time as we can make it clear to the League of Nations that Iraq has acquired a stability which justifies its admission to membership of the League. It is not an undertaking to spend money on or to keep troops in Iraq, either for the maintenance of internal order or for its defence against external aggression, but to continue our co-operation and advice in maintaining a stable system of government. It may be asked what will be our responsibility for the defence of Iraq if, after the expiration of the present treaty, that country should be attacked by any foreign Power ; it is obvious that the responsibility which we should have towards Iraq, if, as a fellow member of the^ League of Nations, she were the victim of unprovoked aggression, would certainly not be diminished by any treaty relationship with us which continued our mandatory position. But the League itself has a special responsibility towards a State over which it exercises a mandatory super-[13878]
vision, and if the aggression in question were directed to the forcible overthrow of a boundary fixed by the Council of the League itself, the responsibility of the League, as the authority directly challenged and affronted, would obviously . &apos; be the primary and dominant one. Our responsibility in any future situation must necessarily depend on the circumstances of that situation. The action which we should take and the method and extent of any support which we might give in a particular case cannot be fixed in advance or be a matter of prior obligation. They must be determined by the Government of the day if ever the case arises, in the light of the then existing circumstances and the general interests of the Empire.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer thinks it indispensable that this statement should be made to Parliament before the meeting of the Council of the League. The other Members of the Committee present at the meeting, while willing that the statement should be made if necessary, hope that the necessity may be avoided until after the decision of the Council has been given.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 27, 1925.
