My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,Progressive depression in the coal trade led, at the end of July, to a grave economic crisis, which threatened to result in a disastrous industrial conflict. The danger was averted by the decision to afford temporary financial assistance to the industry. This has made it possible to conduct, under My Commission, a full and impartial enquiry into the economic position of the industry. I am following the course of the enquiry with anxious interest, and I am hopeful that the task of My Commissioners will be lightened by ungrudging and single-hearted effort on the part of all concerned to find a solution for the problems of this great and vital industry.By the passing of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act a further important stage has been reached in the process whereby the resources of the State are made available for the encouragement of thrift and self-reliance. Provision has thus been made, through insurance, against those risks which have been a source of anxiety and apprehension to so many of My people.An Act has been passed to simplify the law of rating, to provide for greater uniformity in valuation, and to improve the local administration of these services.Acts have been passed for consolidating the laws relating to workmen&apos;s compensation in cases of accident, and to real property and conveyancing, and also for consolidating the Judicature Acts and for simplifying and amending the procedure in criminal cases.During the past year there has been a great increase in the number of houses built in England and Wales, and I hope that this improvement, so important to the health and well-being of My people, may continue. The housing position still gives cause for concern in Scotland where special measures have, however, been taken by My Ministers.Encouragement has been given to the establishment of the sugar beet industry in this country by an Act providing for a Government subsidy during a period of ten years.An Act has also been passed to amend the law relating to tithe rentcharge and the payment of rates thereon.In pursuance of the policy announced at the opening of the Session, measures have been enacted for safeguarding by means of customs duties certain industries which have been proved after enquiry to be suffering from unemployment due to exceptional foreign competition of an unfair nature.My assent has also been given to an Act establishing a permanent system of superannuation for teachers, to the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act, and to a measure providing for the institution of a Scottish National Library.In bidding you farewell I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
