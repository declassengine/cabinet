MEMORANDUM BY THE DOMINIONS OFFICE.In the absence of the Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs the attached Memorandum, by the Dominions Office on the Mosul question Is circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed)  M.P.A. HANKEY,Secretar?/- to the cabinet Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1, 15th December,  1925.
Memorandum .At their meeting on the 11th December,, the Committee of Imperial Defence decided inter alia to recommend to the Cabinet that, in the event of an aggression by Turkish forces against Mosul, the Admiralty should be authorised, if at the time they think it advisable, to send ships into the Dardanelles &amp;nd Sea of Marmora without waiting for formal authority from the Council of the league of Nations (but, of course, in definite communication with tho league through the Foreign Oifico), since any delay would give the Turks time to take counter measures by mining and other1&apos;ise*If this recommendation is approved by the  Cabinet, it appears necessary to consider at once the nature of the communication to be addressed to the Dominion Governmentss seeing that it is clearly desirable that notion of this kind should not be taken without the cleare intimation to the Dominions beforehand of what was In con-temp lation9The Dominions have already- been informed in general terms that His Majesty^ Government may be compelled, in co-operation with the League, to take forcible measures against Turkey in the event cf an attack by her upon Iraq;(1)      la a telegram of the 31st October, they were informed of the Instructions given to the High
dommissioner for Iraq and the Air Officer Commanding that in the event of a conspicuous breach of the present provisional frontier, involving a definite advance aorass it by Turkish organised military foroes, which menaces the invasion of Iraq, the Air Officer Commanding should be authorised to take Immediate action within reasonable reach of his aircraft, and, if this is a military necessity, even across the frontier.(s)    In a telegram of the 7th E^vetaber, they were informed of the instruction sent tc the High Commiasionier as to the importance of keeping in the olosest touch with General Laidonar in the event of any aot of aggression by the Turks, or of any incident likely to lead to the outbreak *f hostilities, having regard to the Importance of satisfying the League that the initial responsibility for tho outbreak of hostilities rested with the Turkish Government and not with His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The telegram mentioned that, in the event of the situation developing in such a way as to render it necessary to take action, against Turkey outside Iraq,  the approval ana support of the League would be of particular importance.(3)    In a telegram of the 5th December, they were informed of the warning given by Sir Austen Chamberlain, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as Mandatory power, to the Turkish Ambassador, as to tho consequences of a Turkish violation of the frontier in defiance of the Council of the League in the following words:-&quot;Should Turkey make any attack upon the /
frontier provisionally fixed, or -ultimately determinedby the League, she will be faced with the authority findpower both of the League and of ourselves.&quot;From the above Statements,  and especially the termsof Sir Austen Chamberlain1a warning to the turkish ambassador,  it will be clear to the Dominion governments that, in any active measures which his Majesty&apos;s government might take to meet Turkish aggression against Iraq, theywould wish to have the authority of the League, whether suchaction were taken in pursuance of the general obligationsimposed by the, Covenant upon Eis Majesty1 s Government asa member of the League,  or in fulfilment of their special responsibilities towards the League as Mandatory for Iraq.In the circumstances it would appear that, if theCommittee of Imperial Defence Cabinet decide to approve the recommendation of the     /their decision should be presented to the Dominion Govern-merits in the following form:-In the event ox an aggression,against Iraq, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would naturally desire to await a formal recommendation of the Council of the League inaccordance with Articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant beforethemselves talcing active measures again at Turkey; butit may not be practicable to adopt this course, since todo so might enable the. Turks, while carrying outaggressive action against Iraq, to make extensive defensive preparations which would render ineffective any countermeasures which Eis Majesty&apos;s Government would otherwise be in a position, to take against Turkey when the Council
i o yhad made its recommendation.     Hence it may be necessary In the event of an aggression by Turkish forces against Mosul, not only to take the action indicated in the telegram of the 31st October, but also to send ships into the Dardanelles and Sea of Marmora without waiting for a formal authority from the Council of the League, but, of course, in definite communication with the League.      In this connection information has already been received that the Turks are sowing mines in the Gulf of ismid in violation of the Straits Convention, signed4t Lausanne, Immediate steps are being taken to verify the report, with a view, if it is confirmed, to representations being at once made to the Council of the League under Article 18 of the Straits Convention.It Is thought, that, fUoiii the Dominions&apos; point of view, it would be helpful if the object in sending the ships oould be more specifically defined in. the suggested G miriuniention, e .g. by saying that the intention is that they should be available for carrying out any action which the League Council may subsequently recommend.It may be added that the question of naval action will be of special concern to Australia at the present moment -seeing that H.M.A.S. &quot;Melbourne&quot; is about to be attached to the Mediterranean Fleet,Dominions Office, 15th December,
