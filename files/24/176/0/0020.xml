,..... DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT]Copy NoCABINET.Ed/j/g*TITH5 RENTCHARGE COMMITTEE.lord Ernie1a speech on the Second Reading of the Tithe Bill made It olear that the real oomplalnt of the Collages   against the Bill is that It does not give thein any relief from the rafceability of their tithe rentcharge euoh as is given to the paroohial olergy and to the Cathedral Corporations.     He stated expressly that his amendment excluding college tithe from the operation of the Bill would toe moved in that form in order to give the Government a breathing spaoe In whioh to think of a remedy for the grievance of the colleges, and beoause he would not be in order In moving for any rate relief *Lord Ernie said that if he oould do so he would move that colleges should be put on the same footing in regard to rates as the paroohial clergy, but failing that he urged that they should be treated at least as well as the Cathedral Corporations, and he considered that it would be no solution of the question to deal with it by increasing the State grant to the Universities.To treat the Colleges similarly to the Cathedral Corporations would mean stabilising the rates on their tithe at the figure of  16 for eaoh  105 of tithe whioh is roughly equivalent to giving them remission for   ever of half the rates to whioh they are liable at present.This would leave them a net inoome of  89 instead of  71 for eaoh  105 of tithe, and would make up to the Colleges at the oost of the general taxpayer or ratepayer much more than the small immediate loss which, they would suffer under the Bill during the next three or four years after the appointed day on 31st March, 1927.     This loss has been estimated at  5,000 a year, but the concession suggested would be worth  20,000 a year for ever, so that the Colleges would b6  15,000 a year better off than they
are at present, whereas all other olaases of titheownerstemporarily will be less well off.It is Impossible on any ground of equity todefend suoh a conoession, and if granted, there are no grounds on which it would be possible to resist anextension of the concession to other classes of laytitheowners, particularly the Ecclesiastical Commissionerswhose tithe is used to supplement the inoomes of the poorest members of the parochial clergy.Ihe approximate amount of lay tithe owned bythe various olaases Is as follows:-University colleges 117,000Other Colleges, Schools and Charities 43,000Ecclesiastical commissioners. 276,000Welsh church commission 21,000Individual lay owners 63SrOQO 1,103 ? 000To extend the concession to all these classes would oost  190,000, or if individual lay titheowners were excluded to  80,000.At the present stage of the Bill a rate conaession to the Colleges oould only be given by throwing the cost on the other ratepayers, but this oould not be defended as a permanent arrangement, and everything turns therefore on whether the chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to give an Exchequer grant in aid of the rates on any class of lay tithe.It seems that the opposition of the Colleges will not be removed by anything less than a concession of half rates on the lines set out above, though as a matter of fact their maximum loss would be more than met if they were relieved of one-eighth of the rates on their tithe, which would amount to  5,000 a year,
The question is therefore whether the Govern-ment think it is necessary to buy off the opposition of the Colleges,     If so, it means a permanent annual Exchequer grant, for which, there is really no justifioa-tion, since any embarrassment caused by the 3111 to the finances of the colleges will be purely temporary, if the stabilisation figux&apos;e of 105 is a fair one.If the claim of the Colleges is resisted and Lord Ernie&apos;s amendment is carried, the Government would be bound to move in the House of Commons to disagree with it and could no doubt carry auoh a Motion.       In such circumstances the Lords would be most unlilsely to insist on their amendment as that would Involve the loss of the Bill and would mean that the Act of 1918 would take Its course and tithe would rise to 131 on the 1st January next,W,0.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 7th December, 1925.
