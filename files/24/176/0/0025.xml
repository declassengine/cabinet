A telegram from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India.We are in agreement with the proposals made by the Government of India, and in our opinion it is urgently necessary that steps should be taken at the earliest moment to obtain legislative sanction to these proposals.      It will be noticed that the Viceroy is  of opinion that the first move should be made in India, and this cannot be done until the approval of the Cabinet here has been obtained.We, therefore, propose that1.    The Secretary of State be authorised to inform the Viceroy that the Cabinet approve the proposals, and.2.    Steps should be taken to prepare a draft Bill to be introduced in the Imperial Parliament as soon as the resolutions have been passed in the Indian legislature.E.gecember 14-th, 1925.

As a remedy he proposed tha appointment of two first-class Indian Judges,  first of all to hear Indian appeals, but eventually, when they had established themselves, Dominion appeals also.      The salary he thought should bc 5j000.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that British members  Of the Judicial Cormrdttee commanded great confidence in the Dominions, and he was not sure that Dominion members,  or Indian members, would command equal confidence.     He was, therefore, not in favour of prescfibing that the two new members should be Indian.LORD READING was of opinion that it would be much easier to carry the proposal through the Indian Legislature if it were so prescribed.      It would also get over the communal difficulty. Ee thought  4,000 salary sufficient.After further discussion it was agreed that it was undesirable to lay down any racial qualification, and Lord Birkenhead expressed the opinion that in practice it would be unwise to begin by appointing two Indians, because it would be very difficult to depart from, the pi-ecedent thus created.The questions whether there should be a limit of age, or whether appointments should be made for a specified period (five or seven years) were also discussed..     Of the two Lord Reading preferred the latter, but thought that if either limitation were imposed in the case of these two appointments alone there would be unfavourable criticism in India.     He undertook to consider this cuestion further, and it was left open.-1-
The following were the conclusions finally arrived at on the relevant points  other than the last-mentioned:-Two members for the purpose of hearing Indian appeals,  to be appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for India,      Neither racial nor judicial qualifications to be prescribed.     Men&apos; of high standing at the Indian Bar to be eligible.Salary  4,000, including any pension already earned in India.      Service on the Judicial Committee to count for Indian pension in the case of judges who had not served their full time on the Bench.      The cost to be shared by British and Indian revenues in equal moieties  of  2,000.The two existing members to be allowed to remain.These recommendations require the concurrence  of the Government of India, and Lord Reading asked that this should not Toe sought until he had returned to India,    Legislation this session is therefore impracticable.
PARAFriEASE OP TELE CHAM TO SECRET.AH Y 0? STATE FROM VICEROY, ROME jJEPARTEEST,  Po.  1467S,    EAT EE 18th NOVEMBER,  1925. &apos;Por some time we have &quot;been considering, as you are aware, the question of strengthening,  in so far as Indian appeals are concerned, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.&apos;2.    The  fact that Indian appeals are heard &quot;by the Judicial Committee is in our opinion a very substantial benefit for India. What is required is to secure that the two members who, under the provisions of the Judicial Committee Act of 1832,  sit on the Committee should be men of first-rate ability and up-to-date in their knowledge of Indian law and procedure and experts in Mohammad an and Hindu Law.     These members at present receive the sum of  400 per annum only., that Is apart from any annuity payable from Indian Revenues.    The sum is certainly insufficient definitely to ensure obtaining men of: the calibre required and it probably does not exceed the expenses incurred by some of the persons concerned in attending the sittings of the Committee. Moreover, up-to-date knowledge of Indian law and practice may be wanting,  owing to the fact that they serve for long periods., We consider that a scheme on the following lines, which we understand were discussed by you and His Excellency in England, should be adopted in order to secure what is required.  .Zo    (a)    Appointment of members should be mads by His Majesty&apos;on the recommendation of the Prime Minister after consultation with the lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State.(b) In addition to persons v,ho have held judicial office in India, men cf high standing at the Indian Bar, should be eligible for appointment.(a)    There should be no prescription of racial
qualification-fd) Persons appointed should hold office for fixed tenure. This should not exceed seven years.     We consider this is important element in scheme, although it has been suggested that perhaps limitation of tenure on these lines might lead to unfavourable criticism in India.     We should have no objection if for any reason It is considered that it would be simpler to fix an age limit for retirement instead of fixing a term of years.     We should prefer,  however,  a fixed period of tenure. Age limit if adopted for retirement should, be 65 years.(e) Annual salary for each member should be  4,000., which should be paid half from Indian Revenues and half from the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom.      Such a salary in our opinion would not be excessive.      It would e ompare with the salary enjoyed by lords of Appeal in Ordinary.of  6,000. At present all salaries of Judicial Committee members are paid from the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, but we think that half salary suggested might reasonably be debited to Indian Revenues in view of Indian interests involved-      The total charge on Indian Revenues would therefore be  4,000 in all, reducible by amount of any Indian -pensions to which per-sons entitled fsee provision ( )).ff) In accordance with the normal rule, and in view of the recommendation of salary of  4,000, we consider that, during the period when the salary Is enjoyed, Indian pension should not be payable.-.fg) In the event of either of the two members having held the office of Judge in India, his service on Judicial Committee should count for Indian pension as Chief Justice of the Court in which he served lest.    This would mean that,  for those appointed from the Court of Calcutta, service would count for Indian pension at a higher rate than for those appointed from other Courts.      The persons required however should be of calibre of Chief Justice,  and accordingly,when they are appointed from a Court in India,  and their.
-i 0 K i A, Jappointment may bo regarded as preventing them from qualifying fop pension as Chief Justice of the Court from which they w ere appointed, such Indian pension would not be payable until their service on the&apos; Committee had been completed.4.    In order to give effect to this scheme, it is assumed that parliamentary legislation would be required incidentally regarding the suggestion that the Service should count for Indian pension fvide paragraph 3,  clause  (g),  above). Presumably such legislation would give the Secretary of State in Council power to make rules dealing with the subject.5.    You will we trust be prepared to approve the scheme, and to introduce accordingly legislation In Parliament.think, however, that before parliamentary legislation is introduced, It would be advisable for us to obtain the approval of the Indian legislature to the scheme as it will involve expenditure of Indian Revenues *    Accordingly   our approval is requested to our moving in both Chambers of the Indian legislature resolutions recommending the adoption of the scheme.. We suggest that meanwhile the necessary drafts for parliamentary legislation might be preparedo
