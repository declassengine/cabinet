CONFIDENTIAL[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1925SECRET.CP. 524 (25).CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.AFGHANISTAN.In continuation of CP. 517 (25), I circulate for the information of my. colleagues copies of telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul.11th December 1925. BIRKENfl EAD.From H.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State, 22nd November 1925.18th November. I was to-day informed by Oertel, vide my telegram No. 145, that contract was signed about a month ago between Soviet Legation and Afghan Home Ministry for free construction by Russian engineers of telegraph line, from Kabul to Kandahar, balance of material not already available to be purchased in India. Later, Russians would link up this line from Kandahar to Herat, but he had heard nothing about extension to Chaman. In return for free construction Russians were granted concessions which Oertel said were calculated to further their subversive designs in Afghanistan. When I see the Amir I propose to take line indicated in Government of India&apos;s telegram 1323 S, 22nd October, but if above information is correct I foresee considerable difficulty in manoeuvring Amir into making request for Indian personnel. Russians have also offered free construction next year of telegraph, lines from Kabul to Termez, and propose using reinforced concrete poles to be made on the spot. Cost of both these favours is presumably to be debited against subsidy.From H.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State, 22nd November 1925.18th November. Bernardi, see my telegram No. 90, informs me that 50 Russian agents of Vest-norg are shortly expected in Kabul and states that they are coming nominally for trade and in reality for propaganda only.From H.M. Minister, Kabul, to Secretary of State, 4th December 1925. 2nd December. I shall be glad to receive early instructions as to the attitude I should adopt on the question raised in Viceroy&apos;s telegram No. 1255, dated 7th October, to Secretary of State for India. It is reported on good authority that the Amir intends to spend two or three months at Jalalabad this winter, and it is probable that he will wish to take with him aeroplanes and Russian air personnel to complete the Jalalabad aerodrome, construct hangars and carry air mails between Jalalabad and Kabul. I suggest that I should inform the Foreign Minister at once that His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider as unfriendly and provocative in effect  (1) Flying by Russians in the vicinity of Indo-Afghan border or anywhere east of Jalalabad or Ghazni or south-east of Kandahar. (2) Construction of hangars in Eastern-Southern Ghazni or Kandahar Provincefor use by Russian personnel. (3) Presence of  the Russian   air  personnel in   Eastern-Southern Ghazni or Kandahar Province, except for carrying air mail for Amir when on tour away from the capital. It appears that, as a result of my private warning to Minister of War last August, Amir refused permission to Rtissians on recent Kandahar tour to fly near the Indian frontier or to remain behind in Kandahar or Ghazni to construct aerodromes, and it is important that I should make early representations to avoid awkward fait accompli at Jalalabad.In view of the last sentence of letter 3 attached to the treaty, it would be impossible to convince Amir of the reasonableness of our objections to Russian airmen being-associated temporarily with his visit to outlying provinces.He will certainly contest even those stipulations which I have suggested above, and might even seize the opportunity to denounce.the treaty. But in my opinion the time has come to make it clear to Amir that we will not tolerate Russian air bases near the Indian frontier.A9JLLIBRA864      inn     i o -1.-
