XjS?feT7-7rr^^ Section!.THE Chinese situation grows increasingly difficult and involves serious decisions in reply to Sir R. Macleay&apos;s telegraphic reports.I circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum by Mr. Wellesley, Deputy TJnder-Secretary of State, our principal authority on Far Eastern Affairs. It will show the Cabinet what is the position, what policy we are pursuing, and what is the alternative.A. C.November 28. 1925.[F 5662/1&amp;0/10 No. 1.Memorandum by Mr. Wellesley on the Chinese Situation.THE conference has now reached so critical a stage that I feel the issues must be placed squarely before the Secretary of State, as the decision to be taken now may have very far-reaching effects.Let me begin by restating briefly our policy at the opening of the conference. We were prepared to grant China tariff autonomy by stages in return for effective guarantees for the gradual abolition of li-kin on a pari passu basis, and for this purpose we had prepared a scheme (the Teichman scheme). Subject to general agreement on these two questions, we were also prepared to agree to the consolidation and securing on the new revenues of the more or less disreputable unsecured loan (chiefly Japanese and Latin), which will thereby be converted into gilt-edged securities a not altogether moral proceeding. Further, a system of allocation of customs revenues to the provinces.The first bad knock to this policy is contained in Sir R. Macleay&apos;s telegram No. 17 of the 17th November, in which he reported that the delegates of the Powers had adopted the following resolutions to be embodied in the treaty with China : &quot; The contracting Powers, other than China, hereby recognise China&apos;s right to enjoy tariff autonomy; agree to remove tariff restrictions which are contained in existing treaties between themselves respectively and China; and consent to the going into effect of China&apos;s National Tariff Law on the 1st January, 1929.&quot; The Government of the Republic of China declare that li-kin duties shall be abolished simultaneously with the enforcement of Chinese National Tariff Law, and further declares abolition of li-kin duties shall be effectively carried out by first day of first month of eighteenth year of Republic of China.&apos;&apos;We immediately pointed out to Sir R. Macleay (Foreign Office telegram No. 328) that the wording of this resolution did not make tariff autonomy conditional on the abolition of li-kin. It bound us&apos; absolutely to granting tariff autonomy on the 1st January, 1929, without the right of withholding it if the Chinese Government were to fail in their undertaking to abolish li-kin. All that we can do in that event is to protest. Moreover, the term li-kin was liable to be interpreted in so restricted a sense as to be practically valueless.In answer to this Sir R. Macleay has assured us (telegram No. 19) that &apos; although the Chinese will give it out in China that abolition of li-kin is to be^ undertaken of their own volition and not as a fundamental condition of grant Of tariff autonomy, they have now themselves definitely coupled the two things together,, and from what has been said in the conference there is no doubt of their being committed to abolition of li-kin, not simultaneously with, but -prior to, tariff autonomy. Both on this and other points rest of treaty should provide further safeguards, and -American idea of second conference remains unaffected as a proposal still to be discussed.   Li-kin, moreover, still remains to be defined.&quot;This is a perfectly clear statement. It promises definitely that adequate safe-guards will be provided in the rest of the treaty to correct whatever defects there may be in this formula. Everything therefore depends on the wording of the final [1114 ee-1] &quot;      B
text. It is therefore only fair to Sir R. IVIacleay to reserve our judgement until we are in possession of the text of the treaty in its final form. All I can say is that I sincerely hope that Sir R. Macleay will be able to deliver the goods. Notwith-standing all, I still entertain grave misgivings in regard to the whole situation. We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false security by mere assurances, even on paper. I cannot, in the first place, reconcile in my mind the idea of a public statement by the Chinese Government that the abolition of li-kin is &quot;not a fundamental condition of the grant of tariff autonomy,&quot; with provisions in the treaty to precisely the contrary effect. Secondly, it seems to me that it would be more than C. T. Wang&apos;s life is worth to agree to such provisions. In addition to this we have, on Sir R. Macleay&apos;s own showing, to contend with the lukewarmness of the Americans and sceptical indifference of the Japanese in regard to the li-kin question. One cannot therefore help being somewhat sceptical in regard to Sir R. Macleay&apos;s ^assurances.But even assuming that all these obstacles can be satisfactorily overcome, will the position really be very materially altered ? Theoretically, we shall, of course, be much in the same position as that which was created by the MacKay Treaty of 1902, viz. : China was then promised 12^ per cent, on effective abolition of li-kin, the only difference now being that we go a step further and promise complete tariff autonomy. As the effective abolition of li-kin in the present state of China lies hardly within the bounds of practical politics, it may of course be argued that tariff autonomy will again be postponed to the Greek calends, and that therefore all is well. But therein, in my opinion, lies a great fallacy. The temper of the Chinese people to-day is very different from what it was in 1902, and I have little doubt in my own mind that even if the Chinese fail to carry out their part of the bargain under the treaty, we shall still find it exceedingly difficult, in fact, impossible, to avoid granting tariff autonomy on the 1st January, 1929. We must therefore be prepared to meet this contingency.That is the real crux of the position. Once yve fully realise that, it will be easier to determine on what is the best course to pursue. We are fighting a rearguard action and we have got to see that it is not turned into a rout.Let us therefore take stock of all the factors in the situation and examine the various courses that are still open to us.Presumably we are still free to reject the treaty if its provisions as a whole prove unsatisfactory. The choice, in fact, lies between breaking up the conference or accepting the situation with a determined effort to guard against the worst dangers inherent in it. It is a choice between two evils. The question is which is the lesser ? We have therefore to consider both alternatives. What would the probable consequences be of our breaking up the conference ?1. We should reap the odium of all concerned, the other Powers as well as China. 2. Rightly or wrongly, we should be regarded by China as the one Power whichhad broken its bond entered into at Washington. 3. Our interests in China would be exposed to the full blast of Chinese wrathand the boycott might be intensified. 4. The Chinese might take the bit between their teeth, tear up the treaties and make a direct attack on the Customs Administration.   This would be fatal.5. We should be playing directly into the hands of the Bolsheviks.Can we afford to take these risks ?    I think notThe other alternative means granting tariff autonomy and agreeing to a settle-ment of the unsecured debt in return for practically nothing. This course is neither free from serious objections nor from considerable dangers. In the first place tariff autonomy will not be without its effect on our trade, but it need not in itself affect us vitally if we can secure proper safeguards. If it be remembered that the Chinese do not want tariff autonomy for protective but for revenue purposes they are simply out for more money to squander then they will very soon find out that prohibitive duties will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Nevertheless, in the first flush of fiscal emancipation the Chinese may do incredibly foolish things that may hit us hard. For this reason the Board of Trade are anxious, and rightly so. The Japanese have apparently already come to terms with the Chinese about (1) unsecured debts, and (2) a conventional tariff that will, from their point of view, largely mitigate, if not entirely remove, the evils of tariff autonomy. How this has been obtained remains a mystery.   It certainly looks like some form of bribery, as
pure economic advantages in the shape of tariff concessions, &amp;c, are hardly likely to satisfy the insatiable Chinese thirst for money. However that may be, the Board of Trade are most anxious that, while continuing to work for the effective abolition of li-kin, we should follow the Japanese example and negotiate a conventional tariff to suit our trade. Unfortunately, we have little or nothing to bargain with. We can hardly resort to bribery. The only thing that I can suggest is a promise to raise our Legation to an Embassy and receive a Chinese Ambassador in London, to which I believe the Chinese attach great importance. I do not like the proposal because it is contrary to every sound principle. All I say is that if we can obtain something substantial for it, it might be worth doing, but not otherwise. Our position, there-fore, is obviously a very weak one. To grant tariff autonomy for nothing, although in itself not vitally opposed to our interests, deprives us of the only lever we possess to get the Chinese to put their house in order.By far the most serious objection is that tariff autonomy without proper safeguards will, in the present state of China, only serve to foster and perpetuate internecine strife. It is this on which we ought: to concentrate our attention. We are already informed that Chang and Feng have agreed to share the increased revenues between them, leaving the other Tuchuns out in the cold.Tuchuns who happen to be in charge of maritime provinces would not submit very long to seeing vast sums remitted to Peking. At a time when money is needed to enable a Tuchun to attack a neighbour, the temptation to seize the customs revenues and perhaps fix his own tariff would be very great, and this, of course, would break up the Customs Administration. Moreover, the consolidation of the debt, plus tariff autonomy without adequate guarantees and a proper system of allocation, will render the foreign administration of the customs to a much greater extent a symbol of northern predominance and of foreign support of Peking, and thus the customs will become more liable than in the past to threat of seizure Thus the vicious circle would grow and all the evils which the Washington Conference aimed at remedying by placing the Central Government in funds so that it might govern will thus only be intensified rather than mitigated.Having considered both alternatives, I submit that it is clear that we cannot afford to break up the Tariff Conference; in other words, we must accept the possibility of having to grant tariff autonomy without getting anything for it in return as decidedly the lesser evil of the two.On this assumption there are two great connected dangers, to the removal or mitigation of which all the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to be directed -first, the danger, which directly concerns ourselves, that British trade may be killed by high import duties; secondly, the danger, which concerns all the Powers, but ourselves directly as having the largest interests, that the flow of more cash to Peking exclusively under tariff autonomy will foment civil war and anti-foreign feeling and possibly eventually break up the customs system. Of these dangers, the first can only be met by negotiating a commercial treaty with the Chinese.The second danger can only be met by ensuring that the increased revenues accruing under tariff autonomy will not flow exclusively to Peking, but will be divided equitably between Peking and the provinces. This policy of provincial quotas is already part of the American plan and of our own Teichman scheme, but in view of the fact that the civil war now raging was almost certainly precipitated by the fear that Peking would garner all the spoils, the time has now come when it should be given prominence and made the main plank in our programme as the last chance of escaping complete shipwreck. The Powers should say quite openly to China that they have no wish to interfere in what is undoubtedly a matter of internal administration, but that as a treaty granting tariff autonomy, the proceeds of which were to go to Peking, would inevitably lead to civil war, it is impossible for the Powers to take the responsibility of signing such a treaty unless China takes the necessary steps to avert this danger by first arranging for a fair division of revenues.One way of effecting this would be to communicate the idea in confidence to the Governments at Washington, Tokyo and Paris, with a view to having all the delegations at Peking take up a united stand. There are certain draAvbacks to this course. The matter would leak out and by being discounted in advance would lose much of its effect on Chinese public opinion. Also, the subordinate agents of other Powers would distort the proposal, misrepresent it to the Chinese, and so turn it into a weapon for increasing anti-British feeling. It might, therefore, be preferable to adopt the same method as the Americans when they brought forward their proposals at the conference. That is to say, Sir R. Macleay should take the first [1114 ee-1] B 2
convenient opportunity of stating to the conference that, in our view, the Tariff Autonomy Treaty should be preceded by an, arrangement made by the Chinese Government and actually adhered to by the chief provincial leaders for the division of the customs revenues among the provinces. Following the precedent set by The Americans, he might communicate the text of his remarks to his American, French and Japanese colleagues on the previous day. We could then telegraph to Washington, Paris and Tokyo in order to enlist support for a united stand on this policy.The advantages of this policy and of this method are : 1. Being an eminently sound policy devised in the interests of China, it should enlist support not only from the Powers but from the Chinese as well.2. It would make it quite clear that unless fighting ceased there would be no revenues to divide and it might therefore have the effect of abating the present civil war.3. Great Britain, by taking the lead in such a policy, would recover much of her lost prestige in the eyes of the Chinese with probable good results on the strike and boycott situation.4. Even the Canton Government might think it worth while to be more conciliatory if there were a chance of securing a share of customs revenue.Most of these advantages would accrue even if the Powers do not come into line with us. If they refuse to take a united stand, we should then have to consider our position. In no case should we break up the conference, but we shall at least have made it clear that the responsibility for the evils ensuing on pouring money into the lap of Peking would not rest on our shoulders.On the other hand, if we pursue the first method of previous consultation in Washington, Tokyo and Paris, the whole plan might be stifled in its birth and we could not even disclaim responsibility without reflecting directly on the conduct of the other Powers.Finally, there still remains the question of li-kin, which the Chinese have agreed to abolish. We have thrashed the whole position out with the Board of Trade, and what has emerged from our discussion is that two things are of great importance, the second, indeed, vital, viz., the Commercial Treaty and some arrangements for assigning customs revenue direct to the provinces. If we concentrate on these points we should rest content.if we do not secure a complete and effective abolition of li-kin, for there is no doubt that, as the Japanese have long since realised, such an abolition is not in fact practical politics. If we secure a paper abolition of li-kin it could be made partially effective immediately, it would tend to become more effective as normal conditions recovered and as the Chinese demand for abolition grew stronger, and finally, by sweeping away old treaties and simplifying the definition of illegal taxation, it would remove a potent cause of friction. That would be a solid gain worth striving for. Even a paper abolition will be some good; it will be a simplification and a move in the right direction. The difference between the li-kin problem and the provincial quota problem is that effectively to settle the former will not by itself remove the danger of Peking absorbing all the customs revenues, whereas unless the latter can be arranged, civil war and anti-foreign feeling are certain to increase. They may increase anyhow, but it is up to the Powers not to acquiesce in a situation which would certainly increase them. It is even worth considering whether an announcement by the Powers now that they can only accept tariff autonomy if coupled with a provincial quota arrangement might not have a calming effect on the civil strife actually in progress.The draft telegram to Sir R,. Macleay now submitted (No. 344) is designed to bring out the connection between these points, to explain the relative importance we attach to them, and to elicit his views. It is the result of a discussion with Sir S. Chapman, Mr. Fountain (Board of Trade) and Sir E. Crowe (Department of Overseas Trade), in which Mr. Waterlow and Mr. Pratt took part.V.

It has by now become clear that Chinese are so committed to establishment of principle of tariff autonomy that they can only negotiate execution of measures contemplated by Washington Treaty and such additional measures as may be necessary to secure abolition of li-kin, provided that Powers are definitely committed to negotiation of treaty leading up to tariff autonomy. In all the circumstances, and as Japan and America accepted draft resolution without hesitation, we thought it necessary to follow suit, and propose to subscribe to resolution in full committee on Thursday.[F 5581/190/10]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir R. Macleay (Peking). (No. 328.   Conference.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 18, 1925.YOUR telegrams Nos. 17 and 18 of 17th November : Resolution on tariff autonomy.Resolution as it stands is open to grave objection that neither character nor extent of obligations undertaken by China are precisely defined.1. Consider the probable contingency that nothing effective may be done to abolish li-kin either wholly or partially between now and 1st January, 1929. What is to prevent the Chinese Government from issuing on that day a mandate abolishing it &quot; effectively,&quot; and claiming that tariff autonomy, and with it the Chinese tariff already enacted, should come into operation forthwith ? Such action would be in strict accordance with wording of resolution,, since &quot; enforcement&quot; in paragraph 2 and &quot; going into effect &quot; in paragraph 1 appear to be synonyms, and therefore there is no need for China to take any steps to abolish li-kin before date on which national tariff is to come into force. It would seem indeed that she is actually debarred from doing so.2. But there is another possible contingency which would be even more dangerous. Suppose that arrangements had been made to drop the actual levying of li-kin for some period (which might be short) before 31st December, 1928, and that its levying were to begin again after tariff autonomy had become operative. In that case it could hardly be argued that the terms of the resolution had not been complied with.3. Even if li-kin is really abolished and not merely on paper, the related impositions (see section 10 of the instructions and my telegram No. 315), which are cumulatively the greater evil, would still stand, for anything that the resolution says to the contrary.4. I regard it as essential that tariff autonomy should not come into force until the Powers are satisfied, by experience spread over a reasonable period of time, that both li-kin and the related impositions have disappeared for good. The best way would be to make the period run as from 1st January, 1929, but if necessary you may accept an arrangement under which it would end on that date.5. You should do everything possible to impress your American and Japanese colleagues with the force of these objections, and to secure agreement on a united stand for some way of meeting them, whether by assurances embodied in exchange of notes or by reintroducing the American idea of a second conference to decide whether li-kin has been abolished.6. If you cannot secure agreement, you should refer to me for instructions.[F 5646/190/10] . ------Sir R. Macleay to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received November 21.) (No. 19.   Conference.   Confidential.)(Telegraphic) Peking, November 20, 1925.YOUR telegram No. 328. Situation here is as follows : -The demand for full tariff autonomy, first raised on the occasion of Paris Peace Conference and reiterated with greater force at Washington, has now been made the dominating issue by the Chinese, and position foreseen in paragraph 1 of section 19 ol our instructions has, in our opinion, already arisen.   While moderate element I her tariff autonomy to China as an inherent right of sovereignty,
extreme element, incited no doubt by Soviet influence, find in the demand a con-venient rallying-cry to unite adventurers and malcontents in an attack on all foreign privileges, including those of extra-territoriality, and in initiation of a national movement directed to securing complete emancipation from all forms of foreign control, which Soviet would, of course, welcome and stable element might be unable to stem. These ultra-extremists are not yet in control, seeing they have failed to prevent conference or wreck it so far, but it must be borne in mind that revolu: tionaries are having prolonged measure of success in the south, and that Feng, who is reputed to be advised in politics by C. T. Wang, controls Peking and appears to have improved his position recently in relation to Chang.In these circumstances, it seemed to us very important to prevent early break-down and vital to prevent breach on any issue in which we should be isolated.The terms of declaration regarding tariff autonomy to be made either in the body of a new treaty, in its preamble, or possibly in a separate statement, were thoroughly discussed beforehand with United States delegation, who appeared to agree with our view that Chinese proposals were not satisfactory without amendment. At sub-committee we indicated clearly to them that they would have our support in proposing such amendment, but when senior Japanese delegate proposed resolution adopting Chinese wording with safeguarding preamble that it was to be incorporated with other matters in a treaty to be negotiated, the United States delegate immediately intimated his acceptance, and we therefore felt bound to follow suit, as we should otherwise have been in isolation on an issue to which Chinese attach fundamental importance.We have, moreover, two safeguards against abuse. Firstly, article is a proposed article to be incorporated in a treaty &quot;which will contain other matters to be hereafter agreed upon.&quot;Secondly, this treaty must be subject to ratification. It will, of course, be one of our main preoccupations to. introduce satisfactory guarantees in the rest of the treaty, while, if we fail, opportunity will still remain for demanding assurances before ratification.As regards points 1 to 4 in youv telegram, which reached us after committee had adopted resolution, there is no doubt that although Chinese will give it out in China that abolition of li-kin is to be undertaken of their own volition, and not as a fundamental condition of grant of tariff autonomy, they have now themselves definitely coupled the two things together, and from what has been said at conference there is no doubt of their being committed to abolition of li-kin, not simultaneously with, but prior to, tariff autonomjr. Both on this and other points rest of treaty should provide further safeguards, and American idea of a second conference remain unaffected as a proposal still to be discussed. As regards 3, we have already made definite reservation that li-kin has yet to be defined. Chinese have already stated that by li-kin they mean all taxes, whatsoever their name, &quot;of a transit nature.&quot; We propose to do our utmost to secure acceptance of principle that same goods should not suffer more than one tax to be levied on import or at place of pro-duction, but we fear that it will be difficult to secure any support from the Americans, and are not, therefore, sanguine of success.We intend, of course, to make every effort to secure agreement with American and Japanese delegations in this matter in securing satisfactory arrangements for disposal of extra revenue and in all other points of major importance, but do not propose, without your specific authority, to risk breakdown of the conference even on these points unless we are supported by the Americans and Japanese. In conclusion, we wish to point out that although success of Chinese in securing proposed article may stiffen their attitude in regard to the rest of the treaty, it is equally or more likely to make them anxious to prevent failure of conference and to give them sufficient face to negotiate a reasonable treaty in other matters.We have every reason to believe that they are very gratified and are beginning to appreciate the friendly attitude of the British delegation.We regret that it was not possible to send you this fuller explanation when urgently despatching our telegrams Nos. 17&quot; and 18, and trust that our general attitude as set forth in the present telegram has your approval.(Repeated to Tokyo, No. 79.)
[F 5662/190/10]Sir R. Macleay to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received November 23.) (No. 22.   Conference.)(Telegraphic.) Peking, November 23, 1925.FOLLOWING received from Tokyo No. 279 :-&quot; Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that the Japanese Government have no faith in early abolition of li-kin dues and fear that some Japanese industries, notably cotton goods, may be killed, if in virtue of tariff autonomy the Chinese fix high duties and continue to levy li-kin dues. They therefore propose to negotiate a Commercial Convention with China, and to fix rates on such a scale that Japanese trade will not suffer severely, even if li-kin is levied.&quot; His Excellency spoke as if he anticipated no objections on the part of Chinese Government to such a convention.&quot;[F 5643/199/10]Sir R. Macleay to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received November 20.) (No. 20.   Conference.   Confidential.)(Telegraphic.) Peking, November 20, 1925.MY immediately preceding telegram.At meeting yesterday conference passed resolution, subject to reservations made by various delegates regarding necessity for securing ultimate approval of their Governments, and then arranged for sub-committees to deal with -(a.) Li-kin abolition;(b.) Other purposes, including debt consolidation, to which funds are to be devoted; and (c.) Rates of interim surtaxes.Chinese delegation have since issued text of resolution for publication, and Chinese press will doubtless claim that principal of tariff autonomy in three years&apos; time has been definitely established.Real effect of resolution depends, of course, entirely on, nature of guarantees it may be possible to insert in treaty for carrying out abolition of li-kin. Chinese attitude at present is that both abolition of li-kin and debt consolidation are internal matters which they merely undertake to carry out. This view is being rebutted as tactfully but decidedly as possible. Unfortunately, except for Americans, with whom we are working in close co-operation, but whose views on abolition of li-kin are still indefinite, we seem at present to a great extent isolated on question of securing complete and effective abolition of li-kin and other forms of internal taxation in which little interest has so far been evinced by Japan and Latin Powers, who are principally concerned with obtaining a settlement of their debts. We shall, of course, do our best to secure support for our views at forthcoming Li-kin Sub-Committee, when we shall fight for single tax principle and also, if opportunity affords, endeavour to induce Chinese to proceed with abolition on more practical lines than those of their own plan.Japanese seem bent on taking their own line, that is to say, sacrificing other considerations to keep surtaxes as low as possible during interim period and other-wise appear outwardly to give way on all points to Chinese susceptibilities, while relying on their power to safeguard their own interests after grant of tariff autonomy by negotiation of separate convention tariff treaty.While we shall do our best to secure satisfactory assurances against reimposition of li-kin after grant of tariff autonomy, it is obvious that no treaty guarantees can safeguard us against such a breach of faith on the part of irresponsible provincial authorities if present internal disorders and political disruption continue. As far as Central Government are concerned, we must in this and other respects trust to their good faith, which will, we believe, be kept in so far as may lie within their power.(Repeated to Tokyo.)
[F 5862/190/10]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Sir R. Macleay (Peking). (No. 344.   Conference.   Confidential.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 28, 1925.YOUR telegrams Nos. 19, 20 and 22 of 20th and 23rd November : Resolution on tariff autonomy.1. I fully realise that the concession of tariff autonomy in principle was inevitable and (although the actual form of the resolution adopted still seems to me objectionable) that there are certain safeguards against abuse. To that extent I entirely approve your efforts to surmount the difficulties with which you are confronted. At the same time, you will probably agree that it remains highly problematical whether these safeguards can be made effective. We must, therefore, now consider carefully what our objects should be.2. The same Goods should not suffer more than one Tax. On this (the problem of li-kin, &amp;c.) you are not sanguine of success. America is lukewarm because of fear of seeming to interfere with China&apos;s internal affairs, while Japan is indifferent because she believes only paper abolition of li-kin is attainable. Even a paper abolition, however, could be made partially effective, e.g., by immediate abolition of coast-trade duties. Abolition of barriers might also become partially effective and would tend to become more so on return of normal conditions and on growth of present Chinese demand for abolition. It would also be a great advantage to provide a simple criterion for determining what is illegal taxation, and so sweep away many causes of dispute and friction. Even a paper abolition is therefore worth striving for, especially in view of fact that we also hope to secure allocation of customs revenue to provinces, though probably it is wiser not to link the two questions too closely together.3. Provincial Quotas. The Peking Government want cash and will try under tariff autonomy to wring the last drop out of the customs machinery. In proportion as they succeed there will be a direct incentive to&apos; increased provincial disintegration, since the more cash for Peking the greater the grievance of independent authorities having no share in the spoils. This sense of injustice may ultimately recoil on the Powers, by provoking an attack on the customs machinery and stimulating anti-foreign feeling. Hence a solution of the provincial quota problem, apart altogether from any effect it may have on the li-kin problem, is of paramount political importance to all the Powers alike. It seems to us that at this junctnre the Peking Government should be told plainly that, while having no desire to interfere in a matter of China&apos;s internal administration, we cannot accept the responsibility of adopting a course which seems certain to&apos; provoke an outburst of civil war, and that, therefore, we cannot sign a treaty granting tariff autonomy unless the Peking Government first comes to an arrangement actually accepted by the chief provincial leaders for a division of customs revenues among the provinces. If this policy is adopted two methods are open to us : (1) We might approach Washington, Tokyo and Paris with a view to their delegations taking up a united stand with us on this point; or (2) you might follow the American precedent, namely, take an early opportunity of making the above statement at the conference, communicating the text of your remarks to your American, Japanese and French colleagues the day previously. Possible disadvantage of the first method is that the proposal might leak out and be discounted in advance, and also that it would be distorted and used for purpose of anti-British agitation. The second method, on the other hand, might enable us to take the lead in a policy popular with the Chinese and acceptable to the Powers, and so restore our damaged prestige and ameliorate the - strike and boycott situation, perhaps even in Canton. It might thus do some good, even if the Powers do not come into line; while in the- event, though we should not contemplate breaking up the conference, it would be patent that the responsibility for the ensuing evils would not rest on our shoulders. If Peking proved recalcitrant the possibility of direct consultation between the Powers and provincial leaders should not be excluded. Please telegraph your views as to value of this policy and which method you favour, bearing in mind that though this policy would contribute to the solution of the li-kin problem, its main purpose, on which alone we should ground our appeal for the support of the Powers, is to prevent precipitation of new and more disastrous civil wars and to save the customs machinery from destruction. You should also consider whether immediate adoption of this policy would be likely to prejudice commercial treaty negotiations referred
to in paragraph 5 below, and. whether this disadvantage, if any, is outweighed by possibility that public stand on provincial quota question might have immediate salutary effect on internal conditions.4.* Import Duties on British Goods. Probability that only a partial solution of li-kin problem can be attained must increase our special anxieties as to tariff autonomy. Any Government suddenly presented with a cash-producing machine is likely to make mistakes at first and to risk killing the goose, a fortiori a Government liable at any moment to be stampeded by uncontrollable anti-British elements into disregarding expert advice. In other words, we cannot contemplate tariff autonomy three years hence with equanimity, unless we simultaneously have a satisfactory Commercial Treaty with China in our pockets.5. Is it not possible to imitate the Japanese, who&apos; have probably already arranged their Commercial Treaty at least in. principle ? Suppose, for instance, that you should succeed at a fairly early stage in negotiating, outside the conference, a bilateral convention to be signed simultaneously with the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, in which, in return for a fixed maximum tariff on articles of principal interest to the United Kingdom, to run, say, for ten years, we gave such assurances as we can as to treatment of Chinese exports to the United Kingdom. True, there is hardly anything we can offer that is not merely face-saving, but, even so, this might give sufficient additional prestige to the Chinese Government to make it easier for them to meet us over li-kin and quota problems. It might also be possible to hint to the Chinese that His Majesty&apos;s Government may find it difficult, in face of pressure from business interests in this country, to ratify the general treaty unless they are in&apos; a position to show that those interests have been adequately safeguarded. As a bargaining pawn we might offer the prospect of raising our respective Legations to Embassies on signature. Telegraph your observations as to this method of procedure.
