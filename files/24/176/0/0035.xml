VC A B&apos; I H S T.Pro.viaional Programme of Legislation (Ministry of  ^-!-   - JealtRlT-Memorandum . by the Minis tor of. Health&apos; In Cabinet Paper CP.499(24) of the 19th of November. 1924 ,   I set out a programme of legislation for the Ministry of Health in tho years 1925-1927, and provisional approval was recorded in the Cabinot Paper 64(24) of tho 26th of l\bvembar,1924,The Bills proposed for 1925 have been passed into law, with the addition of the Contributory VvidowoOrphansr and Old Ago Pensions proposed for 1926) except that (l) the Bill for dealing with the smoke nuisance was deferred and (2) tho provision for dealing with railway rating included in tho Rating and Valuation Bill was dropped while that Bill wao in Committee.The programme proposed for 1926 (omitting tho Widows&apos; etc. Pensions Bill) was as follows:-Poor.law.    Bill to reform tho Poor Law.Local Govornmant*    Bill to give effect to recommendations of Lord Onslow&apos;s Commission in regard to creation and extension of County Boroughs and other Local Government mattora.Registration Service.    Bill to reorganise terras andconditions of service of Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages.Public Health (Amendment).   Bill to amend the Public Hoalth Acts.Ma tern11 y home s. Bill to provide for the better regulationof Maternity Homes. Proprietary Medicines. Bill to regulate the   sale of proprietary medicines.
/i 3 CsPood, and Drugs *   Bill to regulate the use of preservatives in food.National .Health Insuranoe-   Temporary Bill to provide for doctors&apos; remuneration on expiry of present arrangements. Public Health (Consolidation).I propose now to defer the throe Bills dealing with Maternity Homes, Proprietary Medicines and Pood and Drugs, and the two Bills dealing with the reform of the Poor Law and of the Registration Service.   I have decided that it Is desirable to allow time for fuller public discussion on Poor Law Reform and I propose to take that Bill in 1927, perhaps introducing a Bill next summert not that it may become law but that the process of public discussion may be completed on the basis of the text of an actual Sill.This decision, however, involves a short Bill aontinuing in some form the temporary arrangements for spreading poor relief expenditure over London mado by the Aot of 1924, which comes to an end next yoar.I should like also to Introduce a Bill enabling me to supersede those Guardians who persist in giving relief which is either excessive or actually illegal.   My colleagues will remember the case of West Ham and certain other Boards of Guardians are unfortunately acting on the same or even a more detrimental policy.A Bill ou National Health Insurance cannot bo avoided. Apart from any   question of economies In   that sphere, tho present temporary financial arrangements under which the panel practice is financed come to an end on the 3lst Docomber* 19263 and legislation next year is necessary to deal with that point. I shall receive early in the yoar the Report of tho Royal Commission on. National Health Insurance and the conclusions of the Government on their findings had better be included in the one Bill.
The position of railway rating is left in a very provisional and wholly unsatisfactory state and the combination of English and Scottish railways necessitates vary oarly legislation.There are therefore four Bills for next year which for ono reason or another aro in the category of necessary Bills: (1)   Poor Law Finance in London. (2)   Guardians Supersession. (3)   National Health Insurance. (4)   Railway Hating.In response to a very strong agitation I have had to give definite pledges to introduce a Bill next yoar dealing with the Smoke Nuisance.Lord Onelow&apos;s Commission has reported on tho subject of the creation and extension of County Boroughs and the Report represents an agreed settlement.   Ponding legislation in pursuance of the Report, indi.vidual cases are held up to the prejudice of good local government and to the great discontent of the local authorities concerned.I propose to deal with these two questions but to have tho necessary Bills introduced into tho House of Londa.Two other Bills require consideration next year. First, &amp; Bill to snake further provision for slum cloar-anco and Blum prevention and to mako further provision for rural housing.   I do not know that.I need argue the case for this Bill further than to s&amp;y that tho public conscience la still deeply atirrod by tho comparatively slow progress in regard to slums and that some amendment of the present legislation la inevitable if quicker progress is to bo made.   As regards rural housing, we are not improving housing conditions in the rural area under the present Acts aa quickly as wc should do in the national interest (to say nothing of tho intoroot of our own Party).
miSecond, a   Bill for further amendments of the Public Health Act as a preliminary to consolidations   The condition of the statute law governing the main activities of this Ministry, Oogc Public Health, Poor Law. and Local Government is nothing short of scandalous and the cause of a shocking waste of time and money both centrally and locally.    Consolidating measures are imperatively needed.    The process has already been begun and I wish to take it one further stage by gotting the Public Health Acts put right.   The Bill   I have in mind is an Amending Bill required as a preliminary to consolidations   I should of oonroe negotiate tho terms with the local authorities and get as near- cue possible to an agreed BillsAccordingly I ask for the favourable oonslderc.tf.cn of those measures by the Cabinet when tho Klng&apos;s Speech, is being framed*(Intd.)
