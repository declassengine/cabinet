4 P qlade Board With reference to Cabinet 54 (25)  Conclusion 5the Committee had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour T.3..(25) 2, relative tc the application sf the Trade Brards Acts to the dining room and light refreshment branch of the catering trade (non-alcoholic)  and to certain distributive trades and also with regard to the future of the Grocery Trade and Boards for England and Wales and Scotland.The Minister cf Labour summarised the present position pointing out as regards&apos; the Grocery Trade Boards that his power, under Section 1(3)  of the Trade Board Act,  1928,  to withdraw a trade from the operation of the Act is limited to oases in which he is of opinion that conditions of .employment have been so altered as to render the application of the Acts&apos; to the trade unnecessary.      As it could not be shown that the conditions had changed for the better since the Grocery1Trade Boards were set up in 1920,  special legislation would probably be necessary to effect the abolition of1the Boards.K II As regards the other trades,  there would beIconsiderable criticism whether the decision was to entertain or reject the applications to apply Tra.de Board procedure to them-      The trades now in questionH(including Grocery)  employed over 600,000 persons,Hj?he&apos;&apos;Emperv Of 212,000 persons em-ployed in the Drapery andsallied.g&amp;fj- Allied Trades 150,000 are females.     Of the adult maleemployees approximately 93^ received wages of 40/- a week cr over,  this covered both urban and rural workers, the lower rates were mainly found in the country districts.
He (the Minister of Labour) did not think that a wage of 40/- or ever could be called a sweated wage if the latter were defined not as a low but as a grievously or unduly lew wage.      With regard to the female employees about 90/  received a wage: of 25/- a week or over.      Only about &amp;%. of all the employees were erganised.      On the whole he did not consider that a case had been made out for     bringing the Drapery Trade under the Acts.SIR H.J. WILS01T reminded the Committee that present wages of 30/- and 40/- a week were equivalent to pre-war 17/- and 23/- a week.      The latter- figures should be taken for comparison, with the pre-war sweated wage -. rates .W) The Meat The Minister of Labour pointed, that the wage rates -jtstriTputivQ$fade (Whole-    in the Meat Distributive Trade were on the whole rather higher than the Drapery Trade rates,  the Trade mainly employed males,  83,500 to 15,500 females&apos;.lie and Retail,i] The Cater-The Minister of Labour pointed that the cash v/ages-tgJTrade [ nanlicensed) .       &quot; (including tips)  received by employees in the &quot;non-licensedcatering trades were conslderahlylower than the wages paid in the other trades under consideration.      On the other hand practically all employees in the catering trades are provided with meals,  the great majority getting 2 cr 3 meals a day-.      It was estimated that the average cost of providing meals to the  employer worked out at 8/3 a week and if this ariirunt is added to the cosh wages the total emoluments received by workers in this industry compare not unfavourably with the earnings of workers in other
distributive trades.    While it would be difficult tomaintain that as regards wages sweated conditions obtained in the catering industry, other conditions of service werefar from satisfactory,  for example the hours of work in thecase of certain juvenile female employees were in manyoases excessive.    The employers in the trade were well organised but speaking generally the bad employers werenot members of the organisations which could not thereforecontrol them.?The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet:-(l)    That no case has at present been made out for applying the Trade Boards Acts to the non-licensed Catering Trade,  the Drapery and Allied Trades and the Meat Distributive Trade and that accordingly the Minister of labour should be authorised to state that requests to apply those Acts to the Trades in question will not in present circum-stances be entertained.(2)    That as regards the non-licensed Catering Trade the Minister of labour should intimate his intention forthwith to give further consideration to the hours and conditions of service (other than wages) *   in the Trade with a view to deciding what action if any should be taken in respect thereto.-TJbg-Grocery       The Minister of Labour observed that apart from Trade.Juveniles, many of whom left the trade at the ages of18 and 21,  employees in the Grocery Trades worked underbetter conditions than in the ether trades under considera-tion.    He again emphasized the legal difficulty of abolishing the existing Grocery Trade Boards.The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet:-That the Minister of Labour should be &apos;     authorised to announce that it was not proposed to nominate new appointed members of the Grocery Trade Boards on. the expiration of the term of office of the present &quot;appointed members&quot;.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.&apos;l, 17th December,  1935.
