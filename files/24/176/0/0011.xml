Irish Boundary Commission, 6, Clement&apos;s Inn,London, W tC .2 .December 1st,   1935.Sir,I am directed by the Irish Boundary Commission to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today&apos;s date in which you express the hope on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the Irish Free State that, the  Commission will be prepared to postpone the issue of their determination until a further communica--tion is addressed to them by,  or on behalf of, Doth Governments, and further indicate that it is also the desire of both Governments that the publication of any official forecast of the Commission&apos;s determination should similarly be postponed.I am directed to say that the Commission is anxious to meet,  as far as is possible, the views of the Governments, and will take no steps either to issue its Award or publish its Report, or an official forecast, without previouslv communicating further with both Governments.The Commission faels that there are strong objections to anything in the nature of an indefinite postponement, and that as long as the publication of its Report and Award are delayed, and. no official forecast of their contents is available to the public, the present situation tendsLETTER PROM THE SECRETARY&quot; TO THE IRISH BOUNDARY COMMISSION TO THE SECRETARY TO THE CABINET.
to become further aggravated owing to continuance of attacks on the Award based on ignorance or mis representa-tioh of its real character and effect,  and of the grounds- -on which it is based.The Commission thinks it may be desirable for a public statement to be made to the effect that the issue of its Award and Report is being temporarily postponed in deference to the wishes of the two Governments, and would be glad, to know whether the Governments would wish to make such a statement themselves,  or whether they would leave it to the Commission to do so.With reference to the last paragraph of your letter I am directed to say that,  in view of the responsibilities which have been imposed upon it, the Commission considers it desirable  that, before the discussions which are taking place between the two Governments reach a stage when decisions may be taken by any of the Governments concerned, the Commission should have an opportunity of discussing the position with the Prime Minister.    The Commission therefore will be glad to meet the Prime Minister, as suggested in your letter, at as early a date as can conveniently be arranged.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,-   (Signed)  P.B. BOURDILLON&quot;Secretary to the Commission.lieut..-Col.j Sir M.P.A. Hankey, 6.0.B/., Secretary to the Cabinet,3, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.T,
