CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY;[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]6Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1925.SECRET.Copy No.30CP. 502 (25).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON POLICY WITH REGARD TO IRAQ.REPORT.AT a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 25th November, 1925 (Cabinet 53 (25), Conclusion 5), it was agreed : &quot; That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows : Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for the Colonies,Secretary of State for India,Secretary of State for Air,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,should meet to frame the declaration to be made to the Council of the League of Nations and the House of Commons respectively with regard to our policy in Iraq.&quot;The Committee met on the 27th November and discussed draft declarations submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. After a detailed examination of these drafts and amendments, which were suggested by various Members, the Committee agreed : That the policy of the Government should be stated to the House of Commons in the terms set forth below whenever the occasion for a statement arose, and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should take the statement as instructions for his guidance when representing the Government at the Council of the League of Nations.&quot; The undertaking we have given is not for a definite twenty-five years, but for what I believe, as the Secretary of State for the Colonies stated to the Council, will be a far shorter period, namely, until such time as we can make it clear to the League of Nations that Iraq has acquired a stability which justifies its admission to membership of the League. It is not an undertaking to spend money on or to keep troops in Iraq, either for the maintenance of internal order or for its defence against external aggression, but to continue our co-operation and advice in maintaining a stable system of government. It may be asked what will be our responsibility for the defence of Iraq if, after the expiration of the present treaty, that country should be attacked by any foreign Power ; it is obvious that the responsibility which we should have towards Iraq, if, as a fellow member of the League of Nations, she were the victim of unprovoked aggression, would certainly not be diminished by any treaty relationship with us which continued our mandatory position. But the League itself has a special responsibility towards a State over which it exercises a mandatory super-Terms of the Statement to the House of Commons.[13878]
