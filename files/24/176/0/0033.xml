H&apos;4-1924     ................   10-71925      ..:.............    10&quot;7The decrease in unemployment which began to be manifest towards the end of October 1925 was maintained throughout the.course of the month under revie\y, the total figures dropping from 1,232,396 on the 26th October to 1,165,275 on the 30th November, a total reduction of 67,121 during the five weeks. The largest proportional decrease was shown amongst boys, whose numbers were reduced by over 20 per cent.This decrease during the month was largely caused by a reduction of unemployment in the coal mining industry; the seasonal improvement of trade m that industry has tended to obscure the serious character of the depression which is still present in shipbuilding and other kindred trades.The total figures are 25,317 less than they were a year ago, though it should be noted that the number of men registered as unemployed was considerably higher than a year ago;  the number of women unemployed, however, shows a decrease of almost 50,000.

(B.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 23rd November, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 11*0, as compared with 11*4 at the 26th October, with 10&apos;8 at the 24th November, 1924, and with 11-5 at the 26th November, 1923.The figures of unemployment in respect of a number of the chief industries for the 23rd November, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago, are given in the table below: 	Unemploy-ment Books	Increase ( + )or decrease( - ) as compared with -			Industry.

This reduction was not shared evenly by the different districts. It was most evident in Cumberland, Westmoreland, Wales and Moumouth. In Scotland and Lancashire coalfields the depression was still severe. The&quot; iron and steel trades and the woollen and worsted industries show further welcome signs of improvement.The position in the Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing Industries continued to be unsatisfactory, but from the amount of orders which appear to have been booked the anticipated improvement ought to be manifest in the near future. In the Linen Industry the depression has not yet lifted, while a notable falling off is to be observed in the Silk Trade. The under-employment and short time in the Artificial Silk branch may be considered as mainly seasonal.(C.) Latest Figures.The latest figures of unemployment published are those for the 14th December, and give the total numbers on the registers as 1,127,500. This shows a decrease on the previous week&apos;s figures of 33,757, and of 30,975 as compared with a year ago.The distribution of the week&apos;s decrease over the various industries is not definitely known, but a geographical analysis shows that reduced unemployment is reported from all parts of the country. An improvement, however, usually occurs at this season of the year and is clearly attributable to Christmas trade.A. STBEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,December 22, 1925.
