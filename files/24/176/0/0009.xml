CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY; [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]- - -Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1925.SECRET Copy No.  J$CP. 510 (25).CABINET.[Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.]MIDDLE EAST.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for information a note of an interview which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and I had with M. Henri de Jouvenel, the High Commissioner of Syria, on the 19th November, 1925.L  S a colonial Office, December 1, 1925.THE conversation began on the general theme of Anglo-French co-operation in the Middle East and the importance of the mandatory Powers acting together. M. de Jouvenel expressed himself as in entire agreement with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on this point.   He said that both General Gouraud and General Weygand had spoken to him of the absolute loyalty with which all the British officials in that part of the world had co-operated with the French.   General Sarrail had given similar praise, but with two exceptions : one, the attitude of Consul Smart in Damascus, and the other, that of Colonel Cox in Trans jordania, in allowing Rikkabi Pasha to go to the border to distribute  30,000 in bribes to foster rebellion in Syria. As regards the latter story, which M. de Jouvenel evidently did not take very seriously, the Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed his conviction that Colonel Cox, who was absolutely trustworthy and cautious and not subject to the excesses of pro-Arab sympathy which might characterise a Colonel Lawrence, would never have allowed such a thing to take place.   In any case, the money was not. there, and both Colonel Cox and Rikkabi Pasha were hard put to it for every penny to carry on the elements of civil administration.    On the subject of Mr. Smart,. Mr. Chamberlain spoke of the confidence reposed in him by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and read to M. de Jouvenel an extract from a recent despatch, which, showed Mr. Smart&apos;s earnest desire to act in cordial co-operation with the French administra-tion and to support French authority.    M. de Jouvenel declared that he fully accepted Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view, and, in any case, would make a point of calling on Mr. Smart as soon as he arrived, and treating him exactly as if no difficulty had occurred between him and General Sarrail.   He intended in the like spirit to send friendly messages to King Feisal and Lord Plumer as soon as he arrived in Damascus.The conversation then turned to more specific topics. A question put by Mr. Chamberlain to Mr. Amery in regard to frontiers drew from M. de Jouvenel the observation that he had intended to raise this question, and enabled Mr. Amery to explain the situation as regards the Jebel Sinjar and the administrative inconvenience of part of this ridge of hills, with its Yezidi inhabitants, being cut off from the rest by the present arbitrary frontier line. M. de Jbuvehel said that that particular point was new to him. He would look into it. What he had had in mind was the Syrian-Turkish boundary. He himself drew attention to the [13895]
unsatisfactory, undefined situation in the wedge south of Jezire-bin-Omar, where the Tigris had never yet been officially settled as the boundary with Turkey, and where there were actually Turkish posts established in what vis-a-vis ourselves was supposed to be French territory. He explained that he was anxious to settle this with Turkey as soon as possible, and that he hoped in this connection to visit Angora, adding that he believed that good relations between himself and the Turks were perfectly consistent with our closest co-operation. Mr. Chamberlain agreed, especially if M. de Jouvenel took the opportunity to impress upon the Turks that there could be no question of driving a wedge between us. But he called attention to the awkwardness, from our point of view, in Iraq of these Turkish detachments in French territory. He did not believe in a Turkish attack on Iraq, but it was necessary to consider even remote contingencies, and if these detachments were strengthened by further infiltration a difficult situation might arise. If Turkish bands should attack from this side it was important for us to know whether they advanced from Turkish territory into which we could follow them, or whether it was French territory, in which case we must look for protection and redress to the French Government.In this connection Mr. Chamberlain referred to the unsatisfactory situation as regards the great excess of eastward movements of Turkish troops over the French railway, with regard to which he had that morning had a talk with M. de Fleuriau. M. de Jouvenel thought these were matters with regard to which the representatives of the League of Nations already in that part of the world could easily and naturally be called in. The application of this to any infiltrations into the Jezire-bin-Omar wedge was obvious and was readily accepted both by Mr. Chamberlain and by Mr. Amery as a satisfactory expedient for checking any action endangering the status quo in that quarter. On their adding, however, that it did not seem clear to them how this applied to the railway situation, M. de Jouvenel explained that he had to confess that he was in a great difficulty. He must admit after studying the documents that the pledges given to us by French Governments as to the limitation of the passage of troops over their territory were not consistent with the Angora Treaty, and that the only ground he could have for stopping the passage of Turkish troops eastwards was to declare frankly that this was action calculated to affect the status quo on the Iraq frontier, a matter specially under the care of the League, and that he was acting pending reference to the League, which, by sending its representatives in Iraq or otherwise, could form its conclusion as to whether the movement contemplated was in fact prejudicial to the status quo. He declared that he would definitely take action on these lines if the Turks begin to press for the passage of further troops. Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Amery accepted this solution as it fortified the British view that the League of Nations has a special responsibility to Iraq.Before leaving frontier questions Mr. Amery referred to the unsatisfactory position in the Yarmuk valley, where the railway crossed and recrossed the frontier a dozen times in twice as many miles.  M. de Jouvenel promised to look, into this.As regards the situation in Syria itself, M. de Jouvenel expressed the view that he was being given all the troops he needed to restore order, but that his real mission was to negotiate peace. This led to a reference to King feisal&apos;s friendly talks with M. Briand and M. Berthelot. Mr. Chamberlain observed that he believed that King Feisal was perfectly sincere in expressing his wish to be on good terms with the French Government and French authorities in Syria. It was obviously his interest and the interest of Iraq to cultivate such relations, &quot; but,&quot; Mr. Chamberlain added, without stressing the point, &quot; the King&apos;s judgment is sometimes unduly biased by family feeling.&quot;There was one matter to which Mr. Chamberlain referred en bon ami, namely, the danger of increasing the number of brigands by destroying villages where brigands had harboured.  M. de Jouvenel thanked him for mentioning it.Just before leaving M. de Jouvenel referred to an official communique which he understood had gone out from the Colonial Office, so worded as to imply that the object of his visit to London was to be instructed in the right way of governing Arabs (it was afterwards ascertained, and M. de Jouvenel informed, that no communique of any sort had been issued). He suggested that to correct this impression a communiqu6 should be made with regard to the discussion which had taken place, laying special stress on that part of the discussion which dealt with frontier questions.   Mr. Chamberlain thereupon drafted the following communique^ with
which, as well as with the conversation generally, M. de Jouvenel expressed himself as highly satisfied :  -      &apos;&quot; M. de Jouvenel was received by Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Amery at the Foreign Office this afternoon.&quot; The French and British Governments, desiring that their close co-opera-tion should extend to all questions in which they have a common interest, thought it useful to exchange ideas on certain questions of common interest to Syria, Iraq and Palestine, and especially in regard to the position of that part of the frontier between the mandated territories of the two Powers which has not yet been delimited. This question will be at once studied by the two Governments with a view to its settlement.&quot;(Initialled)      L. S. A.A. C.
