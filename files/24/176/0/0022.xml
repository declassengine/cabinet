Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper CP.-513 (25)) expressing considarable misgivings in regard to the situation in Iraq.   The Cabine&quot; then decided that- the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should be assembled at once to consider Lord Cavan&apos; s Memorandum and that they should be instructed to state whether they wished to modify the advice given in their previous Report (CI.D.

My colleagues will recall that at our Meeting on
1  FAQ TORS AFFECTING- A TURKISH ADVANCE OS MOSUL.3. The Report which the Committee of Chiefs of Staff have now/submitted to the Committee of imperial Defence in accord-ance with this decision has already been circulated asPap*r C oP.-519125) lb will be gsen that, largely as theresult of new factors brought to their notice by sir henry Dobbs, the Committee of Chiefs of Staff have acceptedthe vie^ of the Chief of tha Air Staff, who is responsible...in this area, that on balance the situation as regards a turkish, advance on Mosul is substantially the same as theyanticipated it would be when they reported on the 14thOctober (C.LD. Paper Koc632-3).    It is true that thestrength of the Turkish force which could be concentratedto the north of Mosul has increased in the course of thelast six weeks 0    The Report of the Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D.Paper No.651-B) does not contain details as to the extentof the increase, but at their meeting on December 11ththe Committee of Imperial Defence were given additional information on the subject.    In their Report of October14th &apos;C.IoD. Paper ITo *632-E)  the Chiefs of Staff had statedthat the fighting strength of the striking force which theTurks could use against Mosul would amount to:-A minimum of * . . 7,500 rifles and sabres, 40 guns,12 aeroplanes:A maximum of .., 15,000 rifles and sabres,  66 guns,12 aeroplanes.The General Staff and the Air Staff are noar agreed thatthe maximum fighting  strength should be increased to20,000 rifles and s a &quot;or - s,  75 guns, as compared with15,000 rifles and sabres,  66 guns,,  In October.4. It will further be seen from, the latest Report of the Chiefs of Staff that  the increas-- in the Turkish forces-2-
is counterbalanced by a number, of new factors (some of &apos; which, such a3 the fall of the  snow and  the state of the country,  are of merely temporary importance, while others, stTCh as the danger to the Turkish communicate ations  from&apos; the Kurd3,  the lack of supplies in the Mosul area,  the improved internal situation in Iraq,  the. arrival of British officers-&apos;-&apos; with units of the Iraq forces, etc.,  are of more permanent value) which are set forth in the Report, and most of which were brought forward by Sir T!enry Dobbs.    In short,&apos;, except, so far as the date of possible danger is closer^ the militar/ situation is, on balance, neither more nor less s serious than it was in October... The Chiefs of Staff recommend, however.,, that, &quot;Insomuch as the date when the actual danger is liable to arise, -is -approaching, the Acting High Commissioner :and the Air Officer Commanding should be given any reinforcements for which they, may ask, or any authority they may de3ire for the raising of local forces.A WAR BBTMM. CRFAT BRITAIN AND TURKEY.     .   &apos; &quot;&quot;&quot; t5. In regard to the possibility of a war between Great&apos;.Britain and Turkey,  the Chiefs of Staff have pointed out &quot;one new factor which has arisen since October 14th, andwhich affects the following recommendation made by theCommittee of Imperial Defence at their 203rd Meeting ( a recommendation not as yet approved by the Cabinet)&quot;That Naval forces should be prepared, if the Cabinet should so decide, to occupy and hold the Turkish islands at the entrance of the Dardanelles,  to enter the Sea of Marmora, and to blockade Constantinople by sea,&quot;The Admiralty have now learned from the Foreign Office that,in the event of an act of aggression by Turkey,  the entry of the Fleet into the Sea of Marmora and the blockade ofConstantinople by sea would be contingent upon a decisionto be given by the Council of the League of Nations.    Thedelay and the publicity involved therein would, In theopinion of the Admiralty, give the Turks time to place the
Dardanelles in a stats of defence?, and. th&apos;* prospects of success in this op.ration would be- d stroy-d.    That is to say, w    ours iv ;s and th   League o* Nations would bo deprived of one of tho  few available methods of putting pressure on Turkey in reply to an aggression.6. The Committee of Imperial Defence were informed that there is  already some information to the effect that the Turks have already laid mines in the Gulf of Ismid and are placing guns in the vie inity of Chanak.    The Com-mitt.ee felt that,  if this information i3 confirmed,  an immediate representation ought to be made to the League of Nations, arid that insomuch as the laying of nines or the emplacement of guns would be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of LauSanne, this action ought to be taker quite irrespective of the Mosul situation.    They have therefore recommended that  the Foreign Office should use their utmost endeavour to check the Admiralty information and,  if it proves correct,  they should suggest to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make representa-tions to  the League during  the present  session.7.    The Committee also discussed the question of whether it would not be justifiable,  in the event of a Turkish aggression against Mosul in contravention of a League decision,  to take action against the Straits without waiting  for formal authority from the League.    &quot;&quot;here appears to be no doubt that in the event of the Turks violating Iraq territory we should be fully justified, from a judicial point of View,,  in taking- this course . In view of the importance of not having the Straits closed against us, the Committee of Imperial Defence feel strongly that, in the event of an unprovoked apgrfission by the Turks against Kosul in consequence of a decision by the Council of the League in our favour,  the  Admiralty,  if according
JL U Llto the information at their disposal at the moment they deemed it prudent, should have authority to send ships into the  Sea of Marmora without waiting for a formal decision by the League, though of course the League should be kept informed of what we were doinp, and of the reasons.POSSIBLE ACTION BY THE LEAGUE  OF NATIONS. 8. The Committee of Imperial Defence also discussed whether the fortification and mining of the Straits would not  justify us in taking action of a preventive character with the Fleet.    Such action by the Turks would not only be a breach of the Treaty of Lausanne but would be just as serious&apos; a matter in its bearing on the Mosul question as the massing of troops on the Iraq frontier.   Although it was felt by some &quot;members. .of the Committee of Imperial Defence that preparations of this -vkind by the Turks, whic h would a It er tb e;&apos; co nd itions &quot;to .bur - di s adv a nt ag e, would justify us in taking action to prevent it^ the Committee do not rrake any recommendation on the subject at the present stage,9.    The Committee of Imperial Defence thought it advisable that the Admiralty should explore the possibilities of a blockade of the &quot;turkish Black Sea coast, since,  if our communications  could-be be.pt open through the Dardanellesand Bosphorus,  this is one of &apos;&quot;he means  available for putting pressure on Turkey.
4 ft vl&apos;U310. Ona of the recommendations of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff was that, insomuch as an advance on the part of Turkey in the north of Iraq would constitute an act of aggression against the League, of Nations,  the action to be taken by the League itself in such an eventuality required further consideration.   Moreover,  it was suggested at the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence that if the League is attacked it will immediately turn to Great Britain, which,  as the mandatory for Iraq, is the State most closely concerned,   for advice as to what action should be taken. The Committee of Imperial Defence considered that  this question should be immediately taken up, and I have accord-ingly appointed a special Sub-Committee., under the Chairman-ship, of the Farl of Balfour,  to study the question.THE  COMMAND IN IRAQ:11.    There is one other question which, though not mentioned in the latest Report of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, was brought up at the Committee of Imperial Defence, which I think I should bring to the notice of the Cabinet.
-J fs PJl U oin.      The Cabinet will recall that the earlier Report of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D. paper I&apos;o. 632-B, para.25)  contained the following recommendation in regard to the Command in the event of reinforcements from India to Iraqu-&quot;We think the first reinforcement,  on arrival, should &quot;be under the supreme command cf the Air Officer Commanding, hut that before subsequent reinforcements are despatched the question should be decided as to whether a Commander-in-Chief should not be apjoointed.&quot;Mhe Chief of the Imperial General Staff strongly urged onthe Committee of Imperial Defence that the principle of thetransfer of the Command should be settled now,, without waiting for the moment of the demand of the second echelon.The reasons urged in favour of this proposal were, first,that in the event of a forced retirement on Baghdad in the face of a determined Turkish attack, it would be veryinvidious to supersede the Air Officer Commanding, moreparticularly if he had conducted the retirement with skill and ability.     The change would be much easier to bringabout if it had been decided on in principle some weeks ormonths beforehand..     Second, that there was reason to suppose that the Commander-in-Chief in India would refuseto send reinforcements amounting to approximately a division unless the Command was to be given to a military officer.     it would therefore he better to faae the question at once.     We further gathered that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff is apprehensive of being placed in a positionin which the responsibility for a difficult and embarrassingsituation may he suddenly transferred to him, and conceivesthat he would be better able to discharge what in any eventwould be a difficult duty if this decision were taken atthe present time.
13. While recognising the -   anxieties   of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Committee of Imperial Defence was unable to accede to his proposal.    There is, of course, no dispute that  if the operations of a British force are predominantly military in character,  the Command should be vested in an Army Officer, and, vice versa, that if the Air forces are the principal factor an Air Officer should hold the Command.    The Committee of Imperial Defence were not convinced that, even after the arrival of the second echelon of reinforcements from India, the land forces would be principally concerned.    It was repre-sented that it might be that the main operations against the enemy would still be conducted by the eight Squadrons of the Royal Air Force now in Iraq, which by that time might have been reinforced, and that the second echelon,  like the first  echelon, would be employed mainly on the lines of communications.   Moreover, it was urged that the responsi-billty and prestige of the Air Officer Commanding would be impaired by a decision that he was to be superseded in the Command on the arrival of the second echelon of reinforce-ments from India and that such a decision might lead him to hesitate before asking for reinforcements which he really needed.14..    In these circumstances the Committee of Imperial Defence decided to adhere to  the previous recommendation of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, that the question should be decided before the second echelon of reinforce-ments is despatched0    They approved, ho &quot;ever, a recommenda-. tion of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff that a General Staff Officer should be sent from India to Iraq as soon as a decision has been taken by the Council of the League in regard to Mosul.   The Committee also decided to recommend that the Chief of the Air Staff should keep the Committee
ft 9. IP 0of Chiefs of Staff closely informed in regard to the air reinforcements he proposed to send to Iraq,  and to the sources from which those reinforcements would he drawn.CONCLUSIONS.15. The Coronit tee of Imp or it 1 Defence approved generally the Report of the commit toe of Chiefs of Staff 1&apos;e.i.D.Paper Kc.651-3)  and agreed  (1) To recommend to the Cabinet that, in theevent cf an aggression by the Turkish forces against Mosul, the Admiralty should be authorised,  if at the time they think it advisable, to send ships into the Dardan-elles and Sea of Marmora, without waiting for a formal authority from the Council of the League of Hations (but, of course, in definite communication with the League through the E^oreign Office), since any delay would give the Turks time to take counter-measures by mining and otherwise.,(2) That the Foreign Office should take immediate steps to verify the rumours that the Turks have already violated the demilitarisation provisions of the Straits Convention, and that, if the rumours are confirmed, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be asked to make immediate represen-t at ions to the league of IT at ions, as provided for in Article 18 of the Straits Convention,   .(3) That a Sub-Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Earl of Balfour5 should be set up to consider the action which the League of Nations could usefully take to apply pressure to Turkey in the event of her resisting the Councilrs decision as to the frontier.    Further, that the Departments concerned should give immediate consideration to this question with a view to a Meeting of the Sub-Committee early in the following week.(Note by the Secretary.
