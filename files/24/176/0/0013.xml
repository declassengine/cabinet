BROOMS AND BRUSHES COMMITTEE.To the Right Hon.Sir Philip Cunlif f e-Lis ter, K.B.E., M.C., M P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,By minute of the Board of Trade dated 12th September, 1925, we were appointed a Committee &quot;to enquire into and report upon an application made by the British Brush Manu-facturers1 Association in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries, presented to Parliament on the 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty upon brooms and brushes&quot; .2,   we have held 14 meetings, of which eleven were devoted to hearing witnesses and arguments put forward on behalf of the Applicants and of the Opponents.   Forty four witnesses were called before us, and in addition we summoned two others.3. Both sides were represented by Counsel: Mr. E.H.C. Wethered (instructed by Messrs. Wedlake Letts &amp; Birds) appear-ing on behalf of the Applicantsj and Mr. A.S. Comyns Carr, R.C., and Mr. G. RussellVick ,  (instructed by Messrs. Stikemen and Company) appearing on behalf of a Group of Importers of the London Chamber of Commerce, who constituted the Opposition.We give below our answers to the eight principal questionsasked In the White PaperQUESTION 1.   Whether the applicant industry is. by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the.goods to which the application relates, or by &quot;reason of the nature of the goods produced^, an industry of substantial importance.4. In accordance with the terms of the white Paper, section (1), the Board of Trade, in deciding whether to order an enquiry, ,&quot;must be of opinion that the industry applying foran enquiry in respect of the whole or any part of Its-1-
production oan reasonably be regarded as of substantial importance, on account either of the volume of employment engaged in such production or of the nature of the goods produced&quot;.We find that from 12,000 to 13,000 workpeople are normally engaged in the industry, and that there is in addition a considerable number of outworkers which cannot be precisely determined.   We confirm, therefore, what we assume to have been the view of the Board of Trade, when referring the Application to us for enquiry, that the industry is of substantial Importance by reason of the volume of employment engaged.QUESTION 2,    Whether forelgn goods of the, class or dga^^E^ionZ^oI^IoH&quot; the appli^tld^rerates are&quot; beingIfflgQ ^o^3slS^B^l llll ^E] ^ consumption in&quot; ihV United&apos; Kingdom in abhormal^o^uantiiies.5. The number and value of brooms and brushes retained forconsumption in the United Kingdom In each year from 1907 to1913, and from 1920 onwards, was as followsDozens.

Second (b), what method of comparing quantities should be taken for ouch diversified
articles as &quot;brooms and brushes?6. (a) Regarding the first of these points, we understand that the comparison which is contemplated for the ordinary case is between the ratio   of retained imports to production at the present time and the corresponding ratio before the war.     We do not think that there is any special feature in the brush-making industry which would make It unreasonable to take such a pre-war ratio   as representing the normal state of affairs.It was put to us by the Opponents that we ought also to make a comparison between the growth in imports of brooms and brushes in recent years and that of other goods, and they attempted to support their contention In this matter by a comparison of the wording of Sections I and II of the White Paper.     They submitted that between 1907 and 1924 the value of retained imports of brooms and brushes had Increased in the same proportion as that of retained imports of all manufactured goods, and that between 1913 and 1924   the value of retained imports of brooms and brushes had increased in only slightly greater proportion than the value of retained imports of all manufactured goods.We do not think, however, that comparisons of this kind are relevant to the question which we have to answer.7. (b) The second point of difficulty is how quantities are to be compared in the case of such diversified articles as brooms and brushes.The Applicants rested their case in answer to Question 2 of the white Paper mainly upon estimates of the numbers of imported brushes entering into consumption here and the numbers of brushes produced in this country.     They claimed to show that the proportion of imported brushes retained for consumption here increased relatively to the home production,
after deduction of exports, from about 32 per cent, in 1913 to about 52 per cent, in 1924.     Otherwise expressed, they claimed that the proportion of foreign brushes represented In 1913 some 24 per cent. of the total consumption of brooms and brushes in this country and 35 per cent, in 1924.Our confidence In the estimates made by the Applicants Of the number of brushes produced in this country at various dates was shaken as the Enquiry proceeded.     The figures for 1913 and 1924 were built up by means of estimated increases upon a figure for the year 1907 which ultimately itself proved tobe an estimate, though based upon information relating to part of the industry published in the Report of the Census of Production.Apart from this, however, the question remains whether quantities of brushes can satlsfactorily be represented by numbers.     If it could be assumed that the proportions of different kinds and qualities of brooms and brushes entering into the Import trade and home production respectively,were approximately the same as before the war, calculations based on nvonbers of brushes would no doubt possess a considerable degree of validity for the purpose in view.     We have, however, received testimony which proves to us that the proportion of different classes of brushes entering into consumption has changed greatly from what it was before the war.     The assumption, therefore, cannot be made.8. It has been represented to us that for a number of reasons the demand for household brooms and brushes has either diminished,, or at any rate not expanded In proportion to the growth of population.     Witnesses attributed this in the case of floor brushes to factors such as the more general introduction of carpet sweepers, vacuum cleaners and mops, and the diminished use of carpets;  in the case of stove brushes to the spread of central heating, open hearth fireplaces, gas and oil stoves; in the case of laundry brushes to the extended use of machinelaundries, washing machines and chemical cleaners.-4-
&apos;1 0In the absence for years prior to 1920 of figures for the separate classes of brooms and brushes imported, it is not possible to say whether imports of household brushes have Increased or diminished as compared with pre-war years , So far  as home production is concerned, returns of output obtained by the Applicants from a number of brush-making firms suggested that the output of these classes of brooms and brushes was probably about the same in 1924 as it was in 1913.9. On the other hand, the use of the tooth brush has undoubtedly shown great expansion in recent years.   This may be attributed partly to the retention of a habit acquired by men who served in the Forces during the War, but mainly to campaigns by educational and health authorities to inculcate the more widespread use of the tooth brush.10. For the reason already indicated it is not possible to measure the growth of imports of tooth brushes compared with pre-war years, but the Increase is undoubtedly very large. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the imported tooth brushes at present oome from Japan, and here the increase has been enormous. Calculations based upon figures given in the Japanese Trade Accounts which show exports of tooth brushes to -this country in 1913 as well as in some post-war years, and upon the figures of imports from 1920 onwards in our own Trade Accounts, suggest that our imports of tooth brushes from Japan were nearly four times as great last year as in 1913; while in 1925 they are likely to be about six times as great.   The information at our disposal does not Indicate how imports of tooth brushes from Germany, which supplies the greater part of the remainder of the Imported tooth brushes, compare with pre-war imports.   So far as home production is concerned,  the returns obtained by the Applicants suggest
that the number of brushes made was approximately doubled between 1913 and 19 24.11. Another marked change, affecting particularly the character of the import trade, has taken place as a result of a greatly increased demand for toy paint brushes.    These are not made here on any large scale.    There has undoubtedly beon a very marked expansion in imports of these brushes from Germany, and hundreds of thousands of dozens are now coming in yearly.As further&apos; shov;ing the change in the character of imports from Germany, a comparison was drawn for us between the German returns of exports of brushes to this country (which are given in tons) and the number of brushes imported Into this country from Germany as shown in our own Trade Accounts.   The comparison indicated that 629 brushes corresponded to a ton in 1913, while in 1923 the number was 1,126, in 1924 1,620 and in the first eight months of 1925 2,590.   Prom this it is obvious that small brushes represent a much increased proportion of the trade..12. Prom all this evidence it was clear to us that we could not judge whether imports are abnormal by considering alone the numbers of brushes imported, without taking into account the value and character of the trade.   We, therefore, had to consider what other method of comparing quantities we could adopt.13. The Opponents claimed that a comparison based on values provided the most satisfactory method of testing whether the ratio of retained imports to production bad chenged.   The value of the home output in 1907 is obtainable from the published results of the Census of Production;  and other information, which Yi/as put before us, made it possible to estimate closely a figure for the year 1913.   Estimates of the value of the output of the industry in 1923 and 1924 were
based on the returns of firms which gave particulars of the value of their output and of the number of persons employed.   As the numbers employed by these firms represented about half the aggregate number in the industry, the Opponents felt justified in contending that the returns comprised also half the value of the aggregate output, which they therefore estimated by multiplying the figure returned by two.    ?,re accepted that contention.The calculation, in which we have made some slight adjustments, gives the following result:-Value of Retained Retained importsOutput. ImportsT a3 Percentage of output.    &quot;    --1907 ....... 1,814,000 335,000 18.51913 ....... 2,000,000 434,000 21,71923....... 3,792,000 836,000 22.01924 ....... 3,812,000 698,000 18.3These figures suggest that,on the basis of values, the ratio of retained imports to production was a little lower in 1924 than it was before the war.No definite Information is available as to production in 1925, tout it was not suggested that there has been any marked change.    The value of imports for the first 10 months Is above the level of the corresponding period of last year, though below that of 1923, so that it appears probable that the ratio of retained imports to production in 1925 will be Intermediate between the ratios for 1923 and 1924.14. Consideration of the above evidenoa convinces us that the quantity of brooms and brushes imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom cannot, in the aggregate, be regarded as abnormal.     It is possible that there may be abnormality in regard to particular classes of brushes, but full proof of this is lacking, except in the case of tooth brushes.
QUESTION 3.    Whether the foreign snoods so imported are being sold or offered for sale Tn&apos; the United &apos;Klngdom&quot;&quot;ai prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can E^prorTlaply manufactured or pro duos d in the United Kingdom.&quot;IS.    In support of their case under this question, the Applicants submitted a large number of samples of foreign brooms and brushes which they claimed to be fairly representative of the whole range of Imports.     They stated in respect of each brush the prioe at which it was offered delivered in this country, and the lowest of three estimates by British manufacturers of the factory cost of producing a similar brush in this country.      Most of the British manufacturers whose quotations were given were called before us and exhibited specimens of the nearest comparable brushes which they themselves were actually manufacturing.We found that the samples put in by the Applicants contained few if any of the superior grades of brushes, and they frankly told us that the cheaper brushes had been selected as being the ones In which foreign competition was particularly difficult to meet-.We also found that in most oases the brush which was exhibited by the British manufacturer as being the nearest comparable brush manufactured by him was definitely superior in quality to the imported article.We obtained from this and other evidence, therefore, a clear Impression that to a great extent the imported artiole is inferior In quality to the British product, and to that extent they are not in direct competition with one another.       In very few of the high class lines has the British manufacturer any serious foreign competition
to fear7 and this is confirmed by the fact that side by *side with the imports of predominantly cheap brashes there is a considerable and growing export of relatively expensive brushes.16.     There is, however, a substantial range of production which stands in direct competition with the imported article.     It is this range which the foreign samples and estimated British costings put In by the Applicants are intended to represent, and   their claim that foreign brushes are being sold or offered for sale here at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced here must succeed or fail on this evidence. 17.     The evidence does not, In our opinion, prove generally, even as regards the commoner ranges of brushes now in question, tnat British manufacturers are not in a position to compete.In several cases the estimated British cost of producing a brush similar to that imported wa3 actually below the selling price of the foreign product.In some other cases the opponents were able to show that a British manufacturer other than the one whose costing was given was able to produce a brush In competition with the imported article;    or, that the costing was for a brush made by hand, whereas a machine made brush could be produced in this country equal in quality and as low in price as the foreign article.In yet other cases it was shown that the imported brushes complained of represented job lots or clearing lines, while several of the foreign firms were proved to
be insignificant in size, so that their competition could not be a serious menace.18.   On the evidence we find that the Applicants showed in a number of instances that British firms could not manufacture at prices to compete with the Imported article.     This was particularly noticeable in the case of Japanese tooth brushes, where it was claimed that the cost of the material alone In this country often exceeds the price of the finished Japanese brush delivered here.     If, however, the whole range of Imported brushes is considered, It has not been shown that British manufacturers cannot compete.     We were particularly struck with evidence given by one of the largest manufacturers of ordinary household brushes that he did not fear foreign competition and was even now able to manufacture at a small profit.Our reply to this question, therefore, must be that the applicants have not made good the claim which they setout to prove.QUESTION 4* Whether, by reason of the severity and extent of such competition, employment in the manufacture or production of such goods In the United Kingdom is being, or is likely to be. seriously affected.19.   Returns submitted to us Indicate that the firms which gave particulars employed about 5 per cent, fewer work-people at the end of 1924 than at the end of 1913.The Applicants originally claimed, on the basis of a smaller number of returns, that there was a decline of 15 per cent., but this figure was steadily diminished as more returns became available.     In view of this, and
of the fact that the returns giving comparable figuresfor 1913 and 1924 even now cover little more than halfthe Industry, we do not feel confident that the changeaince 1913 is aocurately represented.20. On the other hand, regard must be had to theevidence of unemployment.    The percentage of insured workersunemployed In the industry in each month since June 1923,when the figures for this industry were first shownseparately, is as follows%&quot;Percentages of Insured Workers unemploy3d in the brush-making industry in&quot; Great Britain and Northern Ireland.1923.1924.	1925.11.0	13.510.7	12.48.4	9.410.2	10.58.0	10.18.8	13,111.0	12.012.9	14.113.1	14.411.5	12.09.9	mm11.6	-January,..

From July 1924 to June 1925 they are based on an estimated number of 9,810 insured persons, and from July 1925 to October 1925 on an estimated number of 10,340 insured persons.&quot;These figures prove in our opinion that serious un-employment exists in the brush-making industry,   V/e also have evidence that apart from absolute unemployment and systematic short time of a kind which is, we   understand, taken into account in the Ministry of Labour figures, there is an important amount of non-systematio short time.I&apos;-IR -hr:ii-:
21.   The Opponents suggested that we ought to consider the position of the brush-making Industvj, as regards unemployment, In relation to the position of other industries;    but we do not think that such a comparison is relevant to the question which&quot; we are considering.It is necessary, however, to ask how far unemployment is attributable to foreign competition.    It has been suggested that the extensive introduction of machinery in the brush-making industry during and since the war has so increased the output per worker that a much reduced number of workers are required to enable the demand for brushes to be satisfied.V.e cannot ignore this as a factor in the situation at a time when demand is relatively depressed, but we think neverthe-less that the existence of serious foreign competition must be held to be the main factor causing unemployment at the present time,22.   We therefore reply that employment in the manufactureof brooms and brushes in the United Kingdom while not entirelydue to, Is being seriously affected by, the severity and extentof foreign&apos; competition.QUESTION 5. &quot;Whether such exceptional competition comes largely&quot;&quot;fr om countries where the conditions are so differ-ent from those in this country as to render the competition unfair .&quot;&quot;Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed unfair unless it arises from one or more of the following causes : -(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to create an export bounty.(to) Subsidies, bounties, or other artificial advantages(c)  Inferior conditions of employment of labour, whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise, obtaining amongst the persons employed in &quot;the production of the import -ed goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the production of similar goods in the United Kingdom&apos;&apos;
&quot;In making their report upon the alleged unfairness of &apos; the&quot; competition, thet bommi&apos;tt&apos;ee may oall attention&apos; to any igpeolaiyolrbumBtanoes by reason of which, in their oplnibhy the industry In the United -Kingdoaiis plabed&apos; at&apos; a aerious relative disadvantage^.23. The relative importanoe of the different -sources....from, which brooms and brushes are obtained is indioated by the following figures showing the value of total Imports of brooms and brushes from the countries named in 1913, and from 1920 onwards % -Value of Total Imports of Brooms and Brushes.ijjrom	1913.	1920.	1921.	1922.	1923.	1924.

(a) Evidence has been laid before us regarding the influence of depreciating exchange in stimulating exports from the countries concerned. In the oaso of Germany it was certainly of importance in 1922 and 1923, and exports of brooms and brushes to the United Kingdom Increased greatly in those years.    No doubt the effects of inflation did not entirely disappear with the stabilisation of the currency, but these effects did not all make for cheap production, and we do not think that exohange depreciation oan now be considered as applicable to Germany.
3bNo serious case was made out with regard to Japan, from the point of view of depreciation of the exchange, hut we think that the Belgian and French exporters have derived some advantage from it.On the whole, however, the effect of exchange depreciation is not, in our opinion, of great importance in the crush trade at the present time, having regard   especially to the fact-that Continental countries buy their bristles in a world market, that is to say^ mainly in London; and that they labour under certain disadvantages compared with British manufacturers, particularly the cost of transporting bristles from London and the finished brushes to this country,  and also the higher level of interest charges.It was suggested to us that the rapid improvement of the sterling exchange which occurred during the early part of this year as a result of the measures taken to restore the gold standard in this country was responsible for an increase in imports of brooms and brushes at that time.     Any effect of this kind would seem now to have disappeared, and imports in more recent months have been reduced.25. (b) No evidence was placed before us showing that unfair competition with British brushes was caused by the existence of subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages in foreign countries.26. (c) toe have made careful enquiries concerning rates of wages paid In this country, and in Germany, Belgium and Japan; and we proceed to summarize the main facts as they have been shown to us.
In England, wages, and other conditions have beenregulated since 1919 by a Trade Board formed under theAct of 1918.    Minimum basis rates are prescribed with asliding scale ensuring that the actual rates vary accordingto the Ministry of Labour Cost of Living Index,    The ratespaid as from 1st November, 1925, are based on a Cost ofLiving figure of 76 per cent,  above 1914.    Principal ratesfor workers paid by time are as followsSkilled men l/2fd. per hour.Unskilled (21 and over) llfd. per hour.Skilled Women (21 and over)       efd. per hour.Most of the operatives in the Industry are, however, piece workers; and their wages are regulated either according to a minimum piece rate list (which covers many basic operations), or by piece work basis time rates (which is applicable to workers using machines).The piece rate list is worked out so as to yield to the ordinary worker about ,17 per cent, above the time rates.    Piece work basis time rates are fixed in each factory so that the ordinary skilled male worker does not earn less than ls.2fd. per hour and the ordinary female worker not less than 7-1 d. per hour.   Thus the ordinary male worker on machine work is paid ls.2fd.  whether he la a time or a piece worker; while the ordinary female worker on machine work receives 6fd.  or 7^d.  according as she is a time or a piece worker.    Normal hours of work are 48 per week.27.  In Germany our information shows that there has been a substantial rise in rates during the present year. The present rates are payable under a wage agreement which came into force on 27th July, 1925:-

Normal hours are 48 per week.28. In Belgium, rates payable as from 14th September, 1925, at Iseghem, which is the principal centre for the industry, are as followst-time Work.Skilled Workers, minimum 3.50 (7f) per hour. Unskilled workers 2.25 fr. to 2.75 fr.  (5d. to 6d.) per hour.Piece Work.Boring. Average wage of 3.50 fr.  (7-f) per hour. Machine Work. Average wage of 3.50 fr. (7-f) per hour.Rates are stated to be the same for men and for women.29. Regarding Japan, our Information shows that thefollowing average monthly rates of wages are paid in thebrushmaking industrySkilled men............... yen 75.00 ( 6.116.0,Unskilled men............. &quot;    65,00 ( 5,14s.O,Skilled women............. &quot;    35.00 ( 5.Is. 0(Unskilled women........... &quot;    27,50 ( 2.8s. 0,
We have not been informed as to the number of hours worked, but assuming that it is 200 per month, the average wages per hour would be about 8d for skilled men, 6fd for unskilled men, 3^d for skilled women and 3d for unskilled women,30.     Comparing the rates paid in Germany, Belgium and Japan with those paid in this country, we find that in none of the three foreign countries do the rates paid to men approach those paid here.     The time rate paid to skilled men is in Germany 7fd to 9id. (according to locality),  In Belgium 7fd in Japan (on the assumption which has been made) 8d. and in this country ls.2- d.     That is to say the English rate is more than 50 per cent, higher than that paid in any of the three countries named.     The piece work rates for men are also clearly much higher1 in this country than abroad.   Thus in Germany the ordinary rate for piece workers Is 9d. to lofd. (according to locality) compared with ls5d.    or ls.6d. for workers on the piece rate list in this country.31.    The position with regard to women&apos;s wages appears to be somewhat different from that with regard to men&apos;s wages. In Germany the time rate paid to skilled women over 24 is 5-gd to 6-gd; in Belgium (where men and women are stated to be paid the same rates) 7- d.J in Japan (on the assumption which has been made) 3 d., and in this country 7-jsd. which is paid to women of 21 and over.     Thus women&apos;s wages seem to be as high in Belgium as here, while those in Germany are distinctly lower, and those in Japan ai^e less than half those paid here.32.     Summing up, we are of opinion that very keen competi-tion does come largely from countries where rates of wages are much lower than those paid here, but we cannot say that such competition is exceptional.
QUESTION 6.     Whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.33.    we heard a considerable amount of evidence on this matter from witnesses on both sides.So far as the quality of the article produced is . concerned, British brush makers have few competitors, and it is largely for this reason that they are able to carry on an increasing, export trade to the Dominions, the United States and other countries, notwithstanding tariff barriers.fte were told that during and since the war the use of machinery In the industry has become widespread, and we were given reason to believe that the machinery in use here is at least as efficient as that in other countries.34.     The Opponents did not deny that there is factory efficiency, but they contended that manufacturers ought to specialise more upon a limited range of articles, and they questioned the efficiency of the methods of their selling organisation.35.&apos;     We do not feel competent to decide upon the difficult questions of policy which arise in connection with marketing.e note, however, that several manufacturers stated that it was necessary for them to be in a position to offer theirIcustomers a wide range of articles, and that this tended to limit the extent of specialisation in manufacture.36.    Our opinion on the broad question put to us is thatthe industry is reasonably efficient.QUESTION 7.    whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the &quot;class or description &apos; in quest ion would exert a       &quot;&quot; seriously^adverse i effect oh employment In any other Industry. being ah industry&apos; us ing goods of that class or description in productlorn37.    It was represented to us that the imposition of a duty on brushes would injure the export trade in suit and
dressing oases, many of which are fitted with foreign brushes.38. We do not think, however, that this necessitates any important qualification to our answer that a duty on brusheswould exert no seriously adverse effect upon any otherindustry using brushes in production.QUESTION 8.    Whether, having regard to the above c-consideration^lons-&quot;The^ applicant Industry has/ in the opinion ^&quot;H^^bmmTlTE ee, ^ esiaBTIsnecTa claim to&apos; a duty&apos;; and if BgjiiatTate c&quot;r*&quot; ra tes&quot;oT^&quot;duty, in the op in! on of ] the QcSEar^^ee, would&quot; be&quot;reaacnaBly suf f iolent to countervail  Ho unTair competition.39. Having regard particularly to the answers which wehave felt bound to give to Questions 2 and 3 above, we areunable to recommend that a tariff be imposed upon allkinds and descriptions of brooms and brushes as demanded by the Applicants.40.   A class of brushes which caused us to hBstitate in arriving at this decision is that of tooth brushes.Imports of these brushes especially from Japan have grown largely in the last few years.    The brushes are very low in quality and price.    The British makers do not attemptto produce brushes of this quality.    It appears that theJapanese enjoy groat advantage over this country not onlyin their proximity to the supplies of camphor (which is used in the production of celluloid) and of bristles, whichthey obtain from China; but also in the cost of labour fordressing the bristles and making the brushes,41.   We are unable, however, to recommend the impositionof a duty even upon tooth brushes, both because witnesseshave represented to us that a raising of the price wouldresult in diminished use among the poorest classes of thepopulation who purchase the cheap Japanese brushj and becauseno practicable rate of duty    (even the 75f0 asked for by the applicants) would bridge the gap between this brush andthe lowest priced (but superior) British brush.
