I(Also Paper No. CO.3. 30.;COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MILITARY SITUATION IN IRAQ, DECEMBER 3, 1925. (Previous C.I.D. Papers Nos. 4U0-B, 512-B and 632-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1. WE have been instructed by the Cabinet to re-examine the military aspects of the situation in Iraq in the light of the latest developments as outlined in the Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War, covering a Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper No. C.O.S. 29*), and also to consult Sir Henry Dobbs, the High Commissioner of Iraq, who is at present in London.2. We accordingly met on the afternoon of the 3rd December, and had the 1 advantage of hearing from Sir Henry Dobbs his views regarding the local I conditions obtaining at the present time in Iraq. A summary of Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; I statement is attached as an Appendix to this Report.I Factors affecting a Turkish Advance on MosM.3. The new factors in the situation since the date of our last Report, viz., I October 14, 1925 (C.I.D. Paper No. 632-B) appear to be as follows: 4. The strength of the Turkish forces which could be concentrated to the north I of Mosul has increased in the course of the last six weeks, and to this extent we I are in a less favourable position than we were when we last examined the H situation.5. On the other hand, as we anticipated, winter has set in, and Sir Henry I Dobbs informs us that before he left Iraq the approaches to Mosul through the j mountain areas were blocked by snow, while in the lower-lying areas to the j north-west the movement of troops would be hampered by the state of the country M resulting from bad weather. In fact, in this respect Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; information I entirely confirms the following forecast contained in our earlier report (paragraph 22 I of C.I.D. Paper No. 632-B).&quot;By December the winter will have set in; the mountainous country north of the Brussels line will be snow-bound, and even communications in the lower-lying areas to the north-west, though still open, will be sufficiently affected to render any organised attack on a large scale so difficult as to be improbable before next March.&quot;16. An entirely new factor in the situation, which we had not anticipated, is that, according to information given us by Sir Henry Dobbs, there is a complete I lack of forage and supplies in the whole of the Mosul region. Owing to lack of I rain- and a plague of locusts the harvest has failed and the country is completely I denuded, and Mosul itself is being supplied from the south. There is no grass at I all, and the supply of chopped straw, which constitutes the main element in the I feeding of transport animals, is almost non-existent.&quot; - 7. The political situation in Eastern Kurdistan is also unfavourable to the Turks. The Kurds have been alienated by the recent religious oppression exercised by the Turks, and would be glad to seize any opportunity of rising against their* Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 513 (25).[13916]
oppressors. These conditions, therefore, impose considerable difficulties to an advance on Mosul by Turkish troops.8. In addition to the lack of supplies referred to in paragraph 6 above, the conditions on our side of the frontier, too, have developed to our advantage. The moral of the Iraq Army is improving, and this improvement, we anticipate, should further increase owing to the recent arrival of the British officers, who will hold executive rather than merely advisory positions in the Iraq -Army. The attitude of the country as a whole has also improved in our favour; there is practically no unrest in Iraq at the present time, and there is no reason to anticipate internal difficulties provided we are able to maintain our position and avoid any appearance of submitting to Turkish threats or Turkish aggression. Lastly, our combatant forces have also been increased by one British Infantry Battalion, as recommended at the 203rd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence (Conclusion 6).9. After hearing the views of Sir Henry Dobbs, we are of opinion that the increase in the Turkish forces, on which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had laid so much stress, is counterbalanced, particularly so far as an early advance is concerned, by the new factors alluded to above. &quot;We are prepared to adopt the view of the Chief of the Air Staff, who is responsible in this area, that on balance the situation as regards a Turkish advance on Mosul is substantially the same as we anticipated it would be when we reported on the 14th October. But we see no reason to depart from the general view which we then expressed &quot; that the existing forces in Iraq are sufficient to delay any advance by the Turkish forces now to the north of Mosul, but, in view of the large numbers of Turks now concentrated in that area, they, may not be sufficient to hold Mosul&quot; (paragraph 21 of C.I.D. Paper No. 632-B),and that in the event of a resolute attack &quot; we may not unlikely be compelled to fall back on Baghdad &quot; (paragraph 33 of C.I.D. Paper No. 632-B).10. Insomuch as the date when the actual danger is liable to arise is approaching, we think that, if the Acting High Commissioner and the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq should ask for reinforcements or authority for the raising of local forces, their requirements should be met, though we recognise that reinforcements from India at any rate could not arrive before the decision of the League of Nations is issued, nor could they be in Baghdad until twenty-eight days after the first demand is made on the Commander-in-Chief, India, to send them.A War between the British and Turkish Empire?.11. There are certain considerations which necessitate modification in that part of our last Report which dealt with a war between the British and Turkish Empires and which outlined the measures which we suggested should be taken elsewhere than on the Northern Frontier of Iraq. From Section 3 of Memo-randum No. e 6635/32/65* by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it appears that, in the event of an act of aggression by Turkey, the proposal that the Fleet should enter the Sea of Marmora and blockade Constantinople by sea will be contingent upon a decision to be given by the Council of the League of Nations. In these circumstances the delay which must inevitably ensue before the Council of the JJeague can give a decision on a matter of such importance, no less than the publicity which is inseparable from a reference to that body, would prohibit the prospect of complete and rapid success resulting from any such action on our part. The Turks would certainly take full advantage of this delay to place the Dardanelles in a state of defence, and, indeed, we have already received rumours to the effect that they have completed arrangements for doing so, and also for placing mines in the Sea of Marmora. In these circum-stances a complete and rapid success, which alone would justify the risking of the Fleet in operations in the Sea of Marmora, is improbable, and we are therefore of opinion that the Fifth Conchisiont of the Committee of Imperial Defence, taken at their 203rd Meeting, should be reconsidered in the light of the Foreign Office memorandum referred to above.* Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 450 (25). t This Conclusion is as follows : &quot; That Naval -Forces should&apos;be prepared, if - the Cabinet should so decide, to occupy and hold the Turkish islands at the entrance 10 the Dardanelles, to enter the 8ea of Marmora and to blockade Constantinople by sea.&quot;
12. Farther; if it can be established that the Turkish Government is,actually violating the provisions governing the demilitarised zones of the Straits, we consider that no time should be lost in bringing this infringement of international undertakings to the attention of the competent authorities on the matter, as provided by the Lausanne Treaty.13. On the other hand, as stated in our earlier Report (paragraph 32 of 0.1.D. Paper No. 632-B.), aerial action could be taken against the Turks from aircraft-carriers as well as from Cyprus and the north of Palestine. If aerial action could be undertaken from foreign territory adjacent to the Turkish Empire, such as the north of Syria and the islands at the entrance to the Dardanelles, still more important results might be achieved. An advance on the part of Turkey in the North of Iraq would constitute an act of aggression against the League of Nations, and in these circumstances it seems only just that the States Members of the League should give the required facilities.14. We are of opinion that the action to be taken by the League itself in the eventuality contemplated requires close consideration, since the attitude of the League may prove a very important factor in the situation.15. In conclusion, we consider that, apart from the modifications we have outlined above, the recommendations of our last Report still hold good. The situation, however, must be kept continually under observation, so that our plans can be immediately modified to meet any developments which may take place.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W, 1, December 3, 1925.(Signed) BEATTY.CAVAN.     :H. TRENCHARD.APPENDIX.Summary of Evidence given by Sir Henri/ Dobbs, High Commissioner of Iraq, at a Meeting of the Sub-Committee of the Chiefs of Staff, held at 2, Whitehall Gardens, on December 3, 1925.SIR HENRY DOBBS stated that he did not think it was likely that the Turks would undertake any advance on Mosul in the near future, as winter conditions had set in this year earlier than usual and the approaches to the Mosul Vilayet from the north were already blocked with heavy snow. This view was supported by General Laidoner, the League of Nations Commissioner, who had recently made a tour of the northern frontier. Further, the Mosul Vilayet was famine-stricken at the present time, and we were actually sending 10 tons of supplies per day to that area from Shergat.Owing to the failure of the harvest and the plague of locusts, no grass was available and the supplies of chopped straw, which constituted the staple food for pack animals, would not be replenished until the next harvest, which was not due until July.In the circumstances, any Turkish advance would be confined to the right bank of the Tigris, and all supplies would have to be transported on skin rafts, which would float down the river at approximately 3 miles an hour. Movement would therefore be very slow indeed, and he imagined this form of transport would be extremely vulnerable, as it only required one or two of the inflated skins to be punctured for the rafts to sink. Famine conditions also obtained round Gezirah-Ibn-Omar, though he thought that the Turks had supplies north of that place.Political considerations also militated against a Turkish advance. The Kurds were very resentful of the treatment meted out to them by the Turks and of the religious oppression to which they had been subjected. When he left Iraq he was receiving several messages a week from various sections of the Kurds offering to rise against the Turks, which offers, of course, he had refused. The Turks knew very well that we could produce serious adverse conditions in Kurdistan, especially around Rowanduz, at any time we were minded to do so.Conditions in Iraq itself were at the present time more favourable to us than they had ever been before. There was absolutely no unrest apart from minor trouble with small brigand bands in Sulemanieh, which always stopped m the winter. The Iraq army was admittedly not well trained (a condition which would be greatly improved by the presence of the British officers recently sent out), but
its moral was high and its units were doing well in the Police posts along the frontier between Amedieh and the western boundary.General Laidoner had left three observers on the northern boundary and had himself proceeded to Geneva to report. He thought this report would be unfavour-able to the Turks. General Laidoner had expressed the opinion that if Mosul was given back to the Turks now, 120,000 Christians would withdraw to Bagdad and further south, as also would a number of Mahomedans who had been involved in our administration.The presence of the three observers on the frontier would prevent the Turks from pretending that an act of aggression on our part had provoked,their advance.In reply to a question by Lord Cavan, Sir Henry Dobbs stated that he did not rule out the possibility of a* Turkish advance on the western route, avoiding the hills, but he thought that such an advance would be very difficult in the absence of sympathisers and with a mass .of unfriendly Kurds on the East. Even supposing that the Turks did advance, he thought the prospects of the inhabitants of Iraq remaining staunch had greatly improved in the last two years. There had been a considerable &quot; swing-round &quot; of both tribal and town opinion in our favour since the signing of the Treaty. The Arab extremists had disappeared from the politically-minded centres of Baghdad and Mosul. The Shiah Priests, who had in the past been hostile to us, had now adopted a very much more friendly attitude! Should we be obliged to retire, however, or should the League of Nations decide to give Mosul to the Turks, the tribes would be obliged to turn against us in order to curry favour with their new masters.He was uncertain whether the question of the protection of the Anglo-Persian Oilfields was relevant to the present enquiry, but assuming that the possession of these oilfields was vital to our Imperial needs, the question of their protection from the Iraq side was of great importance.Most people in Iraq itself considered that as great a force would be required to hold a line round the Basrah Vilayet as would be necessary to hold a line further north. It. might well be that the cheapest way to defend the Persian Oilfields would be by holding a line to the north of Mosul. If the Turks were able to secure Mosul, the position of the British in Iraq would be most uncomfortable. He himself would be unable to face the situation- as the Arabs would say that the British had betrayed them. Larger forces would, in his opinion, be required in the country than were maintained now. If we retired eventually to Basrah the Turks would still be chafing to get an outlet to the sea, and we would be required to maintain larger forces still to prevent their advance. In his opinion, once the Turks had been able to secure Mosul, they would not rest content until they had reached the Persian Gulf.Any withdrawal on our part from Iraq would be followed by a French withdrawal from Syria, in which circumstances, in his opinion, it was very doubtful whether we should be able to remain in Palestine.In reply to a question by Sir Hugh Trenchard, Sir Henry Dobbs stated that he had little faith in the value of local levies hastily raised. Such levies had been raised in the past, the political effect of which had been very valuable at that time. Owing to the change in political conditions for the better, he doubted whether the raising of local levies would be of any great value. Nor did he think that it was necessary to send reinforcements of Air Squadrons into the country at the present time, although there would not be so much objection to the sending of Air reinforcements as to the reinforcing of ground troops, since the arrival of the former would not be noticed and would create no excitement. He did not feel that there was any risk of attack by the Turks until the spring, and it would be a misfortune to do anything which the Turks might label as a provocative act on our part. He thought that the Turks would really be prepared to negotiate regarding the frontier. If we were prepared to give an undertaking that we had no intention of granting autonomy to the Kurds and we could see our way to guaranteeing a loan to Turkey or arranging some form of alliance with her, he felt confident that the Turks would prefer to settle the question of the frontier by negotiation.In regard to the situation which might arise next spring, he did not think we could take any other steps to improve our position than the despatch of reinforce-ments. There was, however, no necessity to take a decision on this point until after a decision had been given at Geneva. He wished. to emphasise that in any event we could very easily bring about a big Kurdish rising against the Turks afr any time.__o
