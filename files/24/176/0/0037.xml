CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.&apos; 9 A 9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAjTRSTY^S govern.1ENT) .0 A B I N E T. &amp; WPROCEEDINGS OF THE LORDS AT TEE END OF A SESSION.Mcmoraiidrim by the Lord Privy Seal.(Circ-alated with reference to Cabinet 59(&amp;5) Conclusion12 ).The history of the last fortnight affords a notable example of the unsatisfactory conditions in which the House of Lords has. to carry out its legislative functions.      I am not referring to the far-reaching constitutional issues which surround the working of the Parliament Act,  but to difficulties which the modern practice of the House of Commons would involve to any Second Chamber, however constituted and with whatever powers,  so long as the present conditions prevail.      The evil is of many years&apos; standing&apos; and I do not think that the experience of the present Session is so bad as of some other Sessions I have known, but it is sufficiently mischievous to constitute an urgent call for a remedy.There have been one or two minor Bills whi ch have been sent up to us at such a date as to make discussion on them practically impossible, but by themselves they have been hardly weighty enough to produce a scandal.      The Rating and Valuation Bill however,  is in a different category and cannot be swept aside as of comparatively little importance.    It is worth while therefore shortly to set out the circumstances attaching to this Bill and to its passage through the House of Lords, as an example of the abdication which  is forced upon us of the main functions of a Second Chamber.    This Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on April 9th.    ItSECRET. C.Po538(25).
passed its Second Reading after one day?s debate Tout was discussed for 20 days in Grand Committee.      It returned to the House in the Autumn,  was 4 days on Report, and was finally read a Third time and sent to the House of Lords on December 4th.      It was an extremely contentious Bill, giving rise to considerable opposition amongst a section of our own friends.      For this reason,  if for no other,  it was clearly a measure which ought to have closely occupied the attention of the Conservative members of the House of Lords who constitute its large majority.     But of course this id not the principal reason.      The Bill concerns the details of local government, and with many sides of this department of administration the Peers are by experience specially qualified to deal.     Either the work of District Councils or of C0U3rty Councils or of Quarter Sessions is &quot;probably familiar in some degree to almost all of them;    most of them have a practical knowledge of what compounding for Rates means;    and as regards the intricate legal difficulties which surround rating of course we possess amongst us sane of the greatest lawyers in the country.      It was therefore within the practical knowledge of the House of Lords at many points.     Moreover,  no doubt for a good reason,  the Bill avowedly reached us in a condition ,cf drafting which might almost be denominated as foul, and scores  of drafting amendments were requisite.      And not  only drafting amendments,  for notwithstanding the prolonged consideration of i t in the Commons there were several modifications of importance which had to be specifically left over
for the lords to shape.    Yet the Bill was only received by us when Christmcs was in sight,  and we only could have four days between the First Heading and the Second Reading, and only five days between the Second Reading and the Committee, which critical stage was got through  in three hours and &amp; half.      There was only one day between Committee and Report, and the Third Reading followed the latter stage on the next afternoon.      That is to say, while the Commons spent on the Bill 26 days spreading over four or five Pcirliamentary months, the Lords oonsider-ation of it was compressed into four short days, within a fortnight, at a most unfavourable period of the year. And yet as we were placed no more time could possibly have been allowed in the Lords for the Bill,  if Parliament was to be prorogued on December 22nd.   We worked right up to the last atom of margin, to such a point that the Commons could only consider the Lords&apos; amendments on the last day of the Session, and the communication as to the action of the Commons on the lords  amendments had to be conducted in manuscript.      Luckily only one amendment had remained in issue between the two Houses.        No doubt it may be said that the c conditions would not have been quite so inade- . quote if the Lords&apos; had been willing to attend the House in proper numbers end to get more time by actually sitting after dinner,  but even with this increase of effort the proceed-ings v;ould still have been little better than a farce.    For
2f6- ithe ournoses of this paper,  however, it is no concern of mine to impute blame either to the Lords or to the Commons but merely te record the fact that in these conditions there must be unpardonable inefficiency in legislation and the Country must suffer accordingly^I need hardly remind the Cabinet that, though the Rating Bill in this December is a striking example, it is by no means exceptional, and that similar difficulties recur more or less every year.    Is any remedy possible?     I do not believe that there is any probability of abbreviating the discussions in the Commonso    iio long as Party feeling runs high, and contro-versial Bills of great complexity are introduced,   especially where there are sharp differences of opinion amongst our own supporters, no change in the direction of brevity or rapidity is likely .to take place,,    The only direction therefore in which we can look is not towards giving less time to the Commons but towards giving more time - and I should add more suitable time -to the Lords.    And the exasperating thing is that the Lords have abundant leisure to provide this time, but as I have shown no leisure at the only period when they are called upon for important legislative workc     Above all they have nothing to do in the early months of the year whilst the House of Commons is engaged upon financial business.    If our discussions on the Rating Bill could have been postponed from December to February - two short months which in the result could hove made no difference whatever to the local  and national interests concerned - the lords could have done their work with every opportunity of efficient-contingency and completeness.    The only thing which stands in the way of such a remedy is the rule of Parliament- that by the prorogation all   pending legislative business, whatever stege it may have reached   short of the Kbyal Assent, is completely wiped out3 This is surely difficult  to defend,.     :. rom a business point of view I believe it was always a waste of time, but now that  tho wiping out,  not only restricts - it may be - the number of Bills, but means that the Bills that there are will be ill drafted,  if not worse, I am confident we cannot leave it alone.
I i-.gree that there is something to he said for insisting that-where either IIou.se has not completed its own consideration of a Bill when the Cession comes to an end, in that House the proceedings on the Bill in another Session should be begun again de novo.     But where the house of Commons or the House of ^ords have agreed to a Bill, then there appears to be no reason why, because the other House has not dealt with it, the proceedings of tho first House should be absolutely waited, or in the alternative that tho Bill should be put through without proper consideration,    I suggest therefore, that the Standing Orders of the two Houses should be so modified that where a -Bill has passed the House of Commons and not massed the ..Horn., e lords - or vice vers-.though that is of little practical importance - the assent ox the first House should be carried over the prorogation to the next Session just as if no prorc-gat ion had taken place.    It is obvious&apos; that there must be one limitation on these new  acuities.    ;&apos;. Special provision must be inserted to protect the working of the Parliament Act.    But with this limitation I cannot see that there is any valid objection to the change.    It may bo urged that anything which facilitates legislation is un-Conservativo.      Thero is an element of truth I suppose in this, but if the present method has the effect that it hampers and renders inefficient Conservative legislation whilst measures of really subsersive charactor car; never be stopped by technical obstacl of this kind,  the objection,  even from that strictly limited point of view, has but little weight.    And o.&apos; one thing I am sure, that nothing worse can be done to the Conservative cause than to buttress it by a system of inefficiency,which reacts in its result upon the welfare and ultimately upon the temper of the public,oDecember 22nd.,1925.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 29th December,1925.
