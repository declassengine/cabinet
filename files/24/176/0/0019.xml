CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.&quot; &quot; &apos;DQCUMBFT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.* n   . nm    ......   ii   ii    i   in ian r,IMPERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE. a uFurther Foodstuff^ t,o be considered by the Committee. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Imperial Economic Committee was instructed, in accordance with its Terms of Reference, to consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketing within the United Kingdom the food products of the overseas parts of the Empire, with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom in preference to imports from foreign countries, and to promote the interests both of producers and consumers.It was agreed that attention should in the first place be concentrated on Meat and Fruit.    Two Reports have already been issued by the Committee, the first dealing with general questions of identification, publicity^ research, and the allocation of the  1,000,000 a year, and the second dealing with meat.    The Committee is now engaged upon its fruit enquiries which it expects to complete early in 1926. It is-, therefore, important that some decision should be reached at an early date between the Governments of the Empire, by whom the Committee was appointed, as to the foodstuffs next to be considered when the Fruit Report has been presented. Prior consultation with the Overseas Governments is necessary and desirable in order that they may have an opportunity of expressing their views   on   the programme of work suggested, and moreover the possibility of changes in personnel must be borne in mind as in some cases the present members of the Committee were appointed specially on account of their knowledge of meat and fruit.In deciding what categories of foodstuffs might best next be considered it is important to bear in mind the commoditiesSECRET. .P.520(25).
of greatest interest to the different parts of the Empire, and also to ensure that commodities are selected so far as possible which are of interest to those parts of the Empire which were not seriously concerned in either Meat or Fruit.    The following four classes of foodstuffs fill these requirements:-(1) Dairy Produce.(2) Tea, coffee and Cocoa,(S) tobacco.(4) Fish.Dairy produce is of paramount interest to the Irish Free State, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and to some extent the Union of South Afrloa.Tea is of outstanding importance in the case of India and Ceylon,and to some email extent of the Nyasaland Protectorate. India had practically no interest in the enquiries into Bruit and Meat, and it is, therefore, important that some commodities should be selected in the forthcoming enquiries which are of interest to the Indian Empire.   coffee is of outstanding importance to British East Africa, and also, to some extent, to India and the West Indies.   Cocoa is primarily of interest to British West Africa, the West Indies and Ceylon.   Neither British East Africa nor British West Africa was seriously interested in the Meat and Fruit enquiries.   An investigation into Tea,Coffee and Cocoa will, therefore, bring in large and important parts of the Empire which have so far not been directly interested in the work of the Imperial Economic Committee,   Moreover Bussia is once more entering the Tea market and it is probable that it will be seriously disturbed in the near future in endeavouring to equate demand and supply. An early enquiry into the Empire position is therefore of considerable importance.Tobacco is of growing interest in Empire trade, particularly in the case of the Nyasaland Protectorate, British India, British North Borneo^ Canada and Rhodesia,
p iMoreover, the question of Empire tobacco is attracting more and more interest and a full investigation of the. possibilities of increasing the sale in the United Kingdom is of great importance.Fish and FiQh Oil are the most important commodities in which Newfoundland is interested.    So far Newfoundland hasnot been primarily concerned in the work of the ImperialEconomic Committee nor would it be interested in the other commodities set out above.    In fact, vrhon the Committee was setup, the view was adopted in Newfoundland that its immediateinvestigations were unlikely to be of direct interest to that part of the Empire, and that there was no real reason for representation on the Committee at the time.    They agreed,however, to nominate a representative on the understanding thatat some later stage the question of Fish and Fish Oils would come up for consideration.    It is, therefore, important thatthe question of fish should appear on the programme at a reasonably early date.     In addition to Newfoundland the otherparts of the Empire interested in fish and fish oils are theIrish Free State, Canada and the Falkland Islands.It is clear that the Imperial Economic Committee couldnot conduct an enquiry into four separate classes of foodstuffsconcurrently.    Their experience in connection with Meat andFruit hcive shown clearly that two commodities are the utmostthat c n be efficiently dealt with at the same tine.    It is,therefore, suggested that the programme of work for theCommittee for 1926 should be as follows -Spring Session -Dairy ProduceTea, Coffee and Cocoa,,Autumn Scsalcai -Tobacco Fish
Q ^If this proposal is accepted it will be necessary to communicate with the Overseas Governments as soon as possible in order that they might have an opportunity of offering their comments on the programme of work suggested for 1926, and of making such changes as thought desirable in their representation.P.0-L.Board of Trade,Oth December, 1925.
