Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.mm.k 522 (26).The main object of thi3 Bill is to simplify and unify the I rating system in Scotland.    The following aro the more important provisions of the Bill,.1 pa^s^ Councils to cease to be Rating  ufrhoritieg, - Clause 1.This clause transfors the ratine; functions of Parish Councils to Town Councils in tho case of burghs and County Councils in the oaso of counties.     The effect will bo to reduce the number Iof rating authorities in Scotland from about 1,100 to less than 250. I Parish Officers who are engaged full time in the collection of rates i will he transferred to the rating authorities or in,special cases I will be compensated.    Officers of parish councils only part-time ao I engaged will be compensated, - the scale in each case being that I normally adopted in Local Acts and Public General Statutes, including I the English Rating and Valuation Bill.J In each area - whether burghal or ruralj there will beI only one rating authority;   at present there are two and in the lease of police burghs there are throe.I The Bill does not affect the other functions of ParishI Councils, as Local Authorities for the purposes of poor law and lot bar parish administration.   They will requisition from the rating 1 authorities the sums required for their statutory purposes and theseIsums will bo raised by rate3 levied by the rating authority within the parish or part thereof to which the expendituro applies (Clause 2) a Education Authorities who at present requisition fromI Parish Councils will henceforth requisition from Town and County lOouncils  (Clause 5).   This will result in the Education rate being ^levied throughout Counties at a uniform rate, an alteration in the Ingnt direction of the present system under which the education irate for the expenditure of the same County Education Authority has iyaried throughout the different parishes in the county.   This changeJMfication of basis Q$ flatiqgr - Clause 3,l,m Tho Education Rate will bo levied on tho same  basisI(Clause 5).This/1
This involves the repeal of Section 37 of the Poor Law (Scotland) Act, 1845, tinder which, for the purposes of the poor rate   the annual value of property is subject to a deduction for repairs, fee.    Section 57 also operates with reference to the Education rate and other parish rates.    Theoretically under that Section every particular property is entitled to its own deduction but in practice each parish council has drawn up a scale of deductions for classes of property.   These have varied enormously throughout the 869 parishes in Scotland.     The repeal of or the standardisation of the scale of deductions under Section 37 has been recommended by the Royal Commission on Local Taxation (Scotland) 1902, Cd. 1067, by Lord Dunedin^ Committee and by the Committee on the Rating of Machinery (Report 1925, Cmd. 2340),. ,Except with respect to a very limited number of classes of property in burghs which are rated only on one-fourth of their value \e.g8, agricultural land, railway and tramway lines and uniergnjund gas and water pipes) and subject to what is nereinafter stated with regard to the Agricultural Rates Grant Acts. - all rates (other than poor, education and parish rates) are levied on gross valuation.Clause 11 of the Bill provides for equated reliefs corresponding&apos; to tho average reliefs at present enjoyod by the different classes of property.   The scale on the Clause will be applicablo to all rates but has been calculated so as to reproduce as nearly as maybe- the present incidence of rating as between the different classes of properties, - taking account of the fact that for some rates the charge is on gross valuations and for others on a lowor figure.As regards rgricultural lands and heritages the relief provided by Clause 11 will supersede the provisions of the Agricultural Rates Grant Acts so far as they affect tho owner and tho occupier, but not as regards the Grant.   At presont the rates on agricultural lands are under those Acts levied as regards owners enly on one-half of the value and as regards occupiers also on one-half of the value, with a right to the occupier to recover one-half of his share of rates from the owner.   To get&apos; rid of this cumbrous system agricultural lands are to be rated pjuoad owners on three-fourths and quoad occupiers on one-fourth oFTHe gross valuation.IshaaMfliLjf. Machinery - Clause 15,Contrary to the views expressed by the Committee on Rating of Machinery, I am advised by the Lord Advocate that tho provisions of the valuation (Scotland) Amendment Act5 1902, which defines what is rateable machinery in the case of buildings, are still giving rise to difficulties and to litigation.    The language or tnat Act, which treats as part of tho heritage machinery proaucing or transmitting first motive power, is out of date, at least as regards transmission plant in the case of olectricity.   It iMP&amp;gSL QJsia treats as heritable, machinery which cannot be removed without removing part of tho building in which it i3 situated, ^ are nOT being construotod so as to make removable inthe above sense practically all their machinery theroin even of wie largest and heaviest type and I think a definition which can J.e.3o evaded ought to be reconsiderod.   The Bill repeals the 1902 act, and contains a definition of machinery or plant which is to be ^oaotxl^as heritable, tho same rules to apply whether the machinery or plant is within or without a building, , (This last provision is in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Rating ot fiacninory).   It treats as heritable -
9 Q O 3-(1)   what has been held in practice to fall under &quot;machinery or plant for producing first motive power&quot; in the 1902 Act.(2) plant for heating and lighting the premises, reproducing on this point, with a slight variation, the terms of the 1902 Act; and(3)   substantially the same classes of machinery as are treated as part of the premisos under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the Third Schedule to the English Eating and Valuation Bill.All other machinery and plant are excluded.(1)   Under the present system, whereby the Education rate is levied on a parish   Basis, each parish gets the benefit of any parish endowment paid to the Education Authority,,   Now that the Eouoation rate is on a county or burgh basis tin3 speoial treatment of those endowments seems out of place,,   They will go to reduce the deficit  of the Education Authority generally.   It is proposed to relieve Town Councils from continuing to make the   payments they at prossnt make out of thoir common good to Education Authorities -(Clause 6 arid Seoond Schedule),(2)   The Local Government (Scotland) Act. 1889. provides that in levying rates in counties there shall first be charged against owners the average rate paid by owners prior to that Act ana subject thereto the rates are payable equally by owners and occupiers.   That average rate only amounts to a few pence in the pcund in any area (the highest being slightly over 4d. in the  ,) and so as to simplify rating it is proposed that the whole of county rates should be payable one-haig by owners and one-half by occupiers,    Thio adopts one of the recomnendations of the Eoyal Commission of 1902 and recommendation (3) of Lord Dunedin!s Committee  (Clause 8).1 (3). At present County Councils assess for certain purposes m within police burghs.   It is proposed that in future the CountyI thus giving effect&quot;to rScoSmendation (9roT&amp;d^unidin^rCommiltie.(5)   Clause 12  reproduces a provision as regards collection of 1 the occupiers&apos; share of county.council rates from 5^5^^^ I found useful and was ne  jsiM repealed by the Repiesentation or 1 the People Act, 1918.(6)   Clause 14 oxtends the power of County Ocuncils to exempt 1 anyone from payment of rates on the ground oi poverty, thus assimilating 1 their powers to those of Town Councils.lJ0HN G-gilmour&apos;.lottiBh Office, 1 Whitehall, S.f, 1.11th December, 1925*
