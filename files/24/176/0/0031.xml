NEXT IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.My colleagues will recollect that, in the message from the Prime Minister to the Dominion Prime Ministers of the 18th November as to the position of the Dominions in relation to the Treaty of Locarno, it was stated that His Majesty&quot;s Government hoped at an early date to make suggestions as to the date of the next Imperial Conference,Apart from this, there are other considerations rendering it desirable that we should now take up the question of preparations for another Imperial Conference.     The Labour Government proposed in the summer of 1924 that a meeting of representatives of the Governments of the Empire should be held for the purpose of a preliminary enquiry in connection with the present system of consultation on matters of foreign policy and general Imperial interest, with special reference to the question whether the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 on the subject of the Negotiation, Signature and Ratification of Treaties needed to be supplemented and interpreted and whether the principles embodied in it could usefully be extended to other matters affecting foreign relations (see No. 1 in Gmd.2301). Ultimately, and after some hesitation, the Dominion Governments agreed to participate in such an enquiry, but the replies were only just complete when the Labour Government left office. Our consideration of the question led us to the conclusion that it would be desirable not to pursue the suggestion and a despatchwas
was accordingly sent to the Dominions informing them that wo should prefer to defer a considered judgment until we had had an opportunity of studying for a longer period the working of the Eesolution referred to and that we doubted whether there would be any advantage in pursuing further at that stage the proposal for a special enquiry of the kind contemplated (No.25 in Qnd. 2301)0The Opposition have recently reverted to the proposal and reference was made to the matter by Mr* Thomas in the Debate on the Dominions Office vote on the 27th July and by both Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Thomas in the Debate on the ratification of the Locarno Treaties on the 18th November.When we wore considering &quot;tho policy to be adopted in connection with the Geneva Protocol of 1924,, we ourselves suggested a special meeting of the Imperial Conference to be he) d in the early part of the present year,   Owing to the exigencies of Parliamentary business and other circumstances it was found impossible for Dominion Ministers to take part :cn a Conference at the time suggested and the proposal was therefore abanandoned (SeeCmd.2458)oYfo should, however, be open to criticism if we delayed -too long reviving the suggestion.     It is true that before the war Imperial Conferences were held only at four year intervals,, But the general feeling since the war has been that they should, if possible, be held every second year, and fromthat point of view a Conference is already overdue.Assuming that it is agreed that proposals should now be made to the Dominion Governments for a meeting of the Imperial Conference in the near future, the main questions arising are -(1)
i Q 0(1)   the most suitable date to be suggested;(2)   the agenda,A subsidiary question is whether there should be one Conference or whether a separate Imperial Economic Conference should be held as in 1923,I- Cafes.--Experience has shown that there is considerable difficulty in arranging a date convenient for all those concerned,-.^ and that a considerable&apos; period is necessarily occupied in correspondence with the Dominions before arrangements can be completed.     Thus in the case of the Conference which opened in June, 1921, the correspondence with the Dominions began in March 1920 and it was only at the beginning of November 1920 that it was possible to announce that arrangements had been made for the holding of the Conference,Again in the case of the Conferences which opened in October, 1923,, correspondence began in the latter part of November, 1922,. and the public announcement that arrangements had been made for the Conferences was not made until early in April, 1923.On the present occasion there is a special difficulty as regards Canada, owing to the political situation resulting from the recent General Election in the Dominion,    It is the intention of the present Canadian Government to meet Parliament when it assembles On the 7th January, 1926, but it is by no means certain whether they will be able to continue in office and, if so, for how long;:   and there is the possibility of a further General Election becoming necessary at any time0Prom our point of view,, the most convenient time for holding the Conference would seom to be June, 1926 (assuming that the necessary preparations can be completed by that date), andin
, . icin any case, I do not think that v/o.should ourselves suggest a labor date than. October-. 1926*     Tho latter date would present one advantage, viz.- that, if it were adopted, it might be possible for some of the Dominion Prime Ministers to take advantage of the opportunity to attend the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations in SeptemberoThe main political subjects to be discussed at an Imperial Conference would fall under the two headings of (A) Foreign Policy and Defence, (B) Constitutional Questionso A* farejgn..J?policy and, Defence,3 In accordance with the practice on previous occasions, the Imperial Conference would afford an opportunity for a survey of tho whole field of foreign policy and defence,-. The most important of the matters to be dealt with under this head would &quot;bo the foil owing(1)   The situation created by the Locarno treaty   It will be remembered that it has been suggested to the Dominions that they should await an examination of this subject before coming to a conclusion on the question of participation (see the Prime Minister&apos;s message of the 18th November)a(2)   Disarmament, with reference to the proposals for a Disarmament Conference under the auspicos of the League of Nations and the possibility of a Naval Disarmament Conference at Washington,,(3)   Tho Far Eastern situations Singapore, and the general naval policy underlying ito(4)   General defence questions0   For eiaample, it will be remembered thatt at the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 29th Octobers when tho questioners raised of sending to the Dominions the reports of the .8ub-CcmmJ.committees on
i p;9J. (jAir Raid Precautions and Chemical Warfare, tho Prime Minister expressed the view that it would be preferable for these matters(which have an important bearing on the problem of security) toa &apos;be dealt wile by means of/statement at- the next Imperial ConferenceApart tram these general questions, there are &quot;certain specific questions which have reached a stage where personal discussion with the Dominions or some of them is desirable, e0ge. British Policy in the Arctic and icbarstlc, and New Hebrides0The whole system of complication between the GovernmentsOf the Empire on matters ef common interest is likely to   come under review.,   Wo know that the Commonwealth Government desire to -extend the liaison system which has been initiated by theappointment of a special officer in London to obtain information on foreign affairs and there is reason to believe that atleast one other Dominion Government (via, that of New Zealand)will wish to discuss the possibility of making arrangementssimilar to those mode by the Commonwealth government   In any discussion of this subject it might &quot;bo well for us to raise thequestion whether action could be taken for improving thearrangements for the supply&apos;to His Majesty&apos;a Government ofinformation with regard to such foreign relations as are dealtwith by the Dominion Governments themselves *   Canada alreadyconducts direct negotiations with foreign countries (especiallypresenttho United States of imeriea) on a variety of subjects and the / Union Government is showing an increasing tendency to adopt a similar course *; Apart
6oApart from this, tho re are several particular questions of a constitutional character which have given rise to correspondence with the Dominions or have required consideration on the part of His MajestyJs Government since the termination of the last Imperial Conferonce,(1)      The method of representation of the British Empire at International Conferences of a political character. This gave risa to considerable discussion at tho time of the London Conference on the Dawes Scheme in the summer of 1924.   It was finally arranged that the Dominions should be represented on the paneib systom in the British Empire Delegation to tho Conference, b$t Mr. Ramsay Macdonald expressly stated that thiB was a special arrangement for that particular Conference and was not to bo regarded or quoted as a precedent, and in telegrams to the Dominion Prime Ministers of tho 18th August, 1924, he suggested that this matter should form one of the subjects to be discussed at the proposed preliminary enquiry on the system of inter--Imperial consultation (Nos* 9-12 in Gndo2301)o(2)     The bearing of the Dominions7 separate membership -of the League on the principle of Imperial unity,,   This assumed prominence as a result of the action of the Irish Free State Government in registering with the League of Nations, under Article 18 of the Covenant, the Articles of Agreement of the 6th December 1921,   The question of the effect of League Conventions on inter-Imperial relations also arose at the Arms Traffic Conference at Geneva this summer.   A practical manifestation of tho problem is the question of the most suitable method of signature, on behalf of the various parts of the Empire, of Conventions negotiated under the auspices of the League,, whichhasJL o is
4 o JL Ghas recently boon engaging the attention of the Foreign Office an the Dominions Office.(3)      The diplomatic representation of the Empire in foreign countries.   When the appointment of an Irish Free State Minister at Washington was under discussion in the summer cf 1924 the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand expressed considerable doubts as to the effect of such an arrangement on the principle of diplomatic unity of the Empire and the Commonwealth Government suggested that the matter might be deferred until the next Imperial Conference.   They wore informed that His MajestyTs Government would not demur to the suggestion that the general question arising out of the proposal should bo discussed at the next imperial Conference, but that they did not think it possible to defer action on the particular request of the Irish Free State pending an opportunity for such discussions,(4)      A somewhat allied question is that of the status Of foreign Consuls&apos; in the Dominions.   This was raised during the present year byuxe Commonwealth Government and they were then informed that, in our view, it could more conveniently be discuss at an Imperial Conference than by correspondence.(5)   The position of the Dominions and territories mandated to them in relation to General Commercial Treaties negotiated by His Majestyx% Government.   This question has recently been raised by the Union Government.(6)      Tha procedure to be adopted in connection with the ds jure recognition of foreign Governments.   In connection viVci the recognition of the Soviet Government by the Labour Government, there was some comment in the Dominions on the ground that the Dominion Governments had not been fully consul ted in advance; and both the Soviet Government and certain cf the
Dominion Governments raised questions as to the extent to which recognition by His Majesty1s Government involved recognition throughout the SmpirooI have thought it advisable to refer to those questions in some detail as showing the nature of some of the more important outstanding problems^     The manner in which they should be. raised at an Imperial Conference, and in certain cases the desirability of raising them at all, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, are matters to be considered in detail at a later stage0In addition to the political questions referred to above, there are also certain economic questions which will require discussion such as the allocation of the proposed annual grant for tho furtherance of Empire trade, the continuation of the Imperial Economic Committee, and certain matters discussed in 1923 which have not yet been finally . settled (eoge the proposals in rogard to shipping taxation)Q There are also certain questions of a technical character not falling within the economic sphere3 such as certain minor points relating to nationality, and the question of territorial waters, which were in 1923 dealt with by Committees of the Imperial Conference, and may require further consideration at the next Conference*Lastly an Imperial Conference always affords a convenient opportunity for pressing forward our policy of better organised and more extensive migration, and discussions on this subject arc likely to bring up the whole question of financial, assistance to Imperial development.   It is consequently necessary to onsider whether or not there should be following the precodent of 1925t a separate ImperialEconomic
Economic ConferenceMy own view is that the balance of advantage would lie in having cno Conference only,,   This procedure would enable all important questions of principle to be discussed or at any rate finally confirmed by tho full Conference, which will however divide itself into two cr throe-main Committees over which the Ministers more particularly concerned would naturally preside, in order to deal with specific aspects of Empire policy, which in turn could appoint their Sub-Committees to deal with technical questions^   In this connection I should like to suggest the revival of tho pre-war precedent of making uso of the Committee of Imperial Defence as a natural part of the machinery of Imperial Conferenceso    The whole question of the organisation of tho Conference itself, of its machinery and of the method of fixing its meetings, ought I think to be seriously considered at this next Conference, in the light not only of the experience of the last eighteen years since the main lines of the existing procedure were laid down at the .1907 Conference, but more particularly of the experience of the working of the machinery of the League of -NationsoI think that it would be convenisnts as soon as the Cabinet has reached a decision as to the most appropriate dato for a Conference, and the common modifications to the Dominions have   begun, that an interdepartmental Committee should be appointed (over which, I suggest, Sir Maurice Kankey should preside) to consider Agenda matters in detail-.L.S,A.inions Office. &apos; 17th December, 1925
