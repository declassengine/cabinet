In the event of a decision by the Council of the League to assign Mosul to Iraq, the following courses are open to the Turks : -(a) They may accept the decision of the Council, in which event the question we are asked to consider will not arise:(b) They may reject the decision and make an immediate attack on Iraq   an unlikely attitude at a time of year so unfavourable to military operations in the Mosul region, but one which we cannot entirely ignore:(c) They may neither accept nor reject the decision, but make no attack, on Mosul, at any rate not before the Springe    They might, however,  occupy the interval in preparing the Dardanelles for defence.M).TE..

3. The policy bo far recommended by the Committee ofImperial Defence for dealing with a Turkish aggression,whether Immediately or in the coming Spring or Summer,may be summarised as follows(i) The immediate task of dealing locally with any Tuarkish invasion across the frontier as decided by the Council of the League of Nations will devolve in the main on the Air Force,(II)  This F&apos;orce should strike the invaders and their lines of commtinication as rapidly and effectively as possible without waiting for international discussion. But this is only an emergency measure, and the ultimate handling of the situation concerns tha League of Nations, and whatever is done should, if possible, be done in their name.(ill) The words &quot;if possible&quot; are introducedsince the machinery of the League cannot be expected to work with extreme rapidity, and situations may easily arise which require immediate action on the part of the Mandatory Power.    Even a few days&apos; delay might :csnder some operation difficult and costly, which, had it been taken in time, might have been oarried through with the greatest ease.(iv) The Committee of Imperial Defence and theCabinet strongly hold that,  so far as their share o^ a war between the League and Turkey is concerned, it would be most inexpedient that the m a in theatre of any large scale military operations should be in Iraqe(v) An operation which the Committee of Imperial Defence have advised it will be necessary to take immediately on a Turkish aggression against Mosul and before the machinery of the League is in full action, is that of prevent-ing mlnelaying in the Straits of the Dardan-elles, the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus; and tha violation by the Turks of the de militaires-tarised zone in the noighbourhood of these vital channels of conrranication.(vi) Under no circumstances should this country,by landing troops or otherwise, give occasion for the suspicion that territorial expansion of any sort or kind is desired,, or would be accepted, by this  country.    It is especially necessary, therefore,  to be cautious in our dealings with any island which has a good harbour, or with any operation which may even appear to affect the territorial hopes or feax-s of other nations.(vii) The economic sanction, in so far as it is used, should be used by the League as a whole.    There is always some odium attaching, for example, to blockade, and very rarely are awkward
questions relating to international law and neutral interests success fully avoided by the blockading lowers.   The League as a whole must bear the  responsibility of the policy pursxied,  arid not leave it on the shoulders of Great Britain alonei(viii)  In accordance with this general policyevery naval operation and every military operation (if such take place)  should be done under the auspices of the League, by its  direction or with its sanction; and with at least the formal aid and assistance of members of the League other than Great Brit a trio4. The steps which we suggest the British representative on the Council of the League should take to secure theco-operation of the League in some such general plan areas follows:-CASE I,    ACTION IN TEE EVENT OF A SUDDENTURKISH AGGRESSION AGAINST MOSUL,(a) Immediate Action.   The British representative should notify the League of the aggression and of the emergency measures referred to above to be taken by the Air Force in Iraq, and by the Fleet in order to keep the Straits open for the forces of the League,   He should announce our willingness to comply with any decision by the League for a mutual withdrawal by both the  Turks and ourselves.    But, if such withdrawal is not asked for, he should suggest to the  Council that they should nominate Great Britain, Prance and Italy, and perhaps other countries,  to act as mandatories of the League in keeping open the Straits as an essential step in any plan for exerting pressure by the League on Turkey.,(The Foreign Office have reason to believe that the immediate result of an operation by the British Fleet alone in the Sea of Marmora would be  that Russia would invade Bessarabia and force her alliance on Turkey. It is, therefore,  in our opinion, essential to secure not only the assent of the Council but the active co-operation of other members of the League in our action at the earliest po ss ib1e moment.)(b) Subsequent. Action. If asked-to  suggest how the League can further vindicate its decision against the Turkish aggression,  the British representative should suggest the : followihg:-(i)  That the naval representatlves of the Powers nominated to act on behalf of the League should concert a general plan for the blockade of Turkey.
(The Admiralty have worked out the general lines of a plan providing for entry to the Sea of Marmora, blockade of Constantinople, seizure and destruction of all Turkish men-of-war, the cutting and destroying of the Anatolian railway, seizure of Turkish outlying islands, an effective blockade of the Turkish Mediterranean coast, a patrol of the Straits of Gibraltar, and, if circumstances permit, a blockade of the Turkish ports in the Black Sea, The plan contemplates the use of the naval forces of Great Britain, Prance, Italy, and perhaps Spain in the Straits of Gibraltar, as well as of harbours in Greek islands,  and in Roumania in the event of a blockade of the Black Sea,)(ii) That Prance should be asked to support the League by attacking the Turkish communicate-tions with aircraft from Syria.    If, as is probable, Prance is too preoccupied with her own difficulties in Syria to undertake opera-tions against Turkey, she should be asked to permit British aircraft to operate from Aleppo and Alexandretta,(ill.) That Prance should further be asked to take steps to deny the Nisbin railway to the Turks, and to deny to the Turks facilities to attack Iraq through the North-East salient of Syria, or, alternatively, to allow us to do so ,(iv) It may well be that for the most effectiveemployment.of air force Italy (in connection with Leras Island.),  G-reeoe (in connection with her AEgean Islands), Persia (in connec-tion with landing grounds in South Persia) , should be asked to provide bases and other conveniences for the air forces acting under the direction of the League,   But while it is desirable that schemes like these should be carefully thought out, nothing, we think, would be gained by immediately bringing them forward.(v) That Economic Pressure against Turkey should be put in operation by the League as a whole, and the Council should be asked to work out a general plan with this in view.We recommend that the Blockade Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be instructed to mak^ an immediate Report on this aspect of the question.CASE II. IF THE TURKS DECLINE TO ACCEPT the LEAGUE&apos; S DECISION BUT TAKE NO IMMEDIATE ACTION.In.this case we think that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should warn the Council o** the League,, in secret session, of the possibility that the Turks may merely
&apos;be postponing military action until a more favourable season:    that they may employ the interval in preparing the Dardanelles for defence;    that we ha veal ready some information to this effect, though it is not yet sufficiently confirmed to justify us in making a formal protest;    that,  if it is confirmed, we shall at once call on the League to take appropriate action;    and that, in the event of an aggression by the Turks against Mosul, we propose to take the emergency measures, both in Iraq and in the Straits, referred to above.    He should, however, also ask the other States to be ready to co-operate at short notice if the emergency should arise,  and he might remind the Council that they are now building up precedents which will be invoked in the future in cases where other States than ourselves may be primarily interested a(ThtV) A.J.3.9      *      v      aWhitehall Gardens, 8 e?.&apos;. l, December 15,  1925.
