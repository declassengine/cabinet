[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government ]SECRET. Copy-No.    3(.O.P. 537 (25).CABINET.THE FUTURE  OF AIRSHIPS  IN GERMANY AND  THE DIRIGIBLESHEDS AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. The Air Clauses Commission a technical body which reports to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference through the Allied Military Committee of Versailles  is at present discussing the future of aeronautical control in Germany. In this connection there is one question in particular which indirectly raises political in addition to naval, military, and air considerations, and I circulate this memorandum in order that my colleagues may be fully apprised of the position.This is the question of modifying the present limit on the size of airships which Germany is allowed to construct or maintain, with which is intimately connected the question of the future of the airship sheds and plant at Friedrichshafen, designed for the construction of large dirigibles.2. By the Treaty of Versailles (Article 198) Germany is prohibited from maintaining any military or naval air forces. By the so-called nine rules this prohibition is interpreted as precluding the construction or maintenance by Germany of dirigibles which exceed certain specified dimensions in the case of rigid airships 30,000 cubic metres. Further, in Article 202 of that Treaty it is stipulated that amongst other aeronautical material &apos;&apos; all dirigible sheds&apos;&apos; shall be delivered to the principal Allied and Associated Powers.3. Under this latter article all the principal dirigible sheds which existed at the time of the Armistice were destroyed except those at Friedrichshafen. The Friedrichshafen sheds escaped destruction only because they were required for the building of a dirigible airship (the Z.R. 3) for the United States. In authorising the building of this ship in December 1921, the Conference of Ambassadors expressly stipulated that &quot;when the delivery of the above-mentioned dirigible is completedf, the hangar .... will be immediately destroyed . . . .&quot;Construction of the Z.R. 3 was completed in September 1924, but no decision has yet been taken as to whether or no the Friedrichshafen sheds and plant are or are not to be demolished in accordance with the terms of the resolution quoted in the preceding paragraph.The future of these sheds has, in fact, been allowed to remain virtually in abeyance for twelve months, but in view of the discussions referred to above it is ;unlikely that either the French or the Germans will allow this state of affairs to continue. /4.   It is therefore necessary to decide what line is to be taken by the British Mrepresentatives in this and the larger question of relaxing the present restrictions 1on the size of dirigible airships constructed or maintained in Germany.5.   On broad political grounds there is clearly much to be said in favour of Ipermitting these sheds at Friedrichshafen to remain with a view to their future juse for purposes of commercial air transport and further of considerably increasing the present maximum size allowed for rigid and other dirigibles.On the other hand, whilst the Air Staff do not consider that in so far as concerns European warfare, the airship can be considered any longer as &apos; a formidable offensive weapon, it cannot be denied that to allow Germany unrestricted freedom in the developmerft of lighter-than-air craft would place in the hands of future German Governments a weapon with which, under favourable conditions, considerable damage might be done to this country and its industrial centres, naval and military (&apos; [13994]Printed for the Cabinet.

establishments, &amp;c. more particularly those situated at a distance from our present and projected anti-aircraft defences. The potential use of airships for purposes of naval reconnaissance as aeroplane and troop carriers, &amp;o, must also not be overlooked. &quot;... 6. &apos; On the whole, however, I am of opinion that the danger to be anticipated from some relaxation of the present restrictions on the size of airships (with or without the exemption of the sheds and plant at Friedrichshafen from destruction) is not sufficient to outweigh the political objections to rigid insistence upon their retention in the changed atmosphere of European politics to-day which has found expression in the Locarno Pact provided always this relaxation does not go too far.. As regards the degree of relaxation we have, I feel, a quite sufficient safeguard in French nervousness of anything likely to strengthen unduly Germany&apos;s power of offensive action. France is, of course, even more exposed to a German attack by air than this country, and any measure of relaxation acceptable to the French is likely, I think, to be such as can safely be endorsed by this country.7. I propose, therefore, that, as the question has already been raised at Paris and an urgent decision is required, the British representatives shall be authorised to go as far but no further than the French.This course will have the additional advantage of ensuring, on this point at least, harmonious co-operation between ourselves and the French.8. Accordingly, unless I hear from any of my colleagues that they dissent from this policy, I propose to issue instructions in this sense.S. Ff.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, December 24, 1925.
