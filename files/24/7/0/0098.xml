SECRET.G.T.- 190PpTFFTIAh.YPLIJP OF 32AI2 A3 AIT AXIY. . (Memorandum by the Foreign Office)So .fsr as tho Foreign Office aro concerned tho entrance of Spain into the war on the side of tho Allies could certainly not bo regarded as anunmixod blessing.From the purely political point of view almost tho only advantage would be that tho accession to the Allies of tho most intensely Catholic country in the world would necessarily influezieo. tho: feeling&apos;of Catholics generally throughout Europe and America, and might be of considerable assistance to pro-Ally propaganda in South American countries,,   It is however doubtful whether this probable effect&quot;on Catholic opinion would be of much practical valuo.Of more direct assistance&apos;in tho prosecution of the war would bo the disappearance of Spain as a possible base, to some small extent, of supplies for the enemy., Spain cannot however from her geographical position bo 6f any great assistance economically to the Central Powers, and it may be hoped that tho blocke.de is now so efficient that supplies can only very rarely reach Germany or Austria from Spanish ports0The main advantago of Spanish intervention in the war would however, probably be the measures which Spain would be compelled, or induced, to take against trading with tho onomy, and the opening -which this would offer &quot;to-British and Allied trado to secure new Spanish markets0 Germany has now gdt an exceedingly strong commercial position in Spain, and her temporary disappearance from the Spanish field&apos;would offer many profitable openings for British enterprise.An important point woiild he the freeing for Allied trado of the German ships at present interned in Spanish ports, but as this is more a question for the Admiralty It is not necessary to dwell on it in this memorandum DAs to the disadvantages of Spanish intervention it is only necessary to examine what compensation Spain - would probably demand in return for joining the Allies.She Spanish Ambassador at Paris has hinted that these would bo;1.   Tangierc2.   Gibraltaroand 3.   A free hand in Portugal, and there is no reason to suppose that this forecast is not correct.As regards Tangier it is generally admitted that it would be opposed to our interests to let it become-
2Spanish instead of international as at present,   Spain is quite incapable of governing or developing Tangier efficiently.   JDven if&quot;France wero to agree to&quot;Its being now handed over to Spain - which is difficult to &quot;believe - there would remain a perpetual danger of France picking a quarrel&apos; with Snain in order to seise and obtain Tangier for herself/ which would nullify all tho olaborato precautions taken in 1904 to exclude France from tho northern coast of Morocco.Tho question of exchanging Gibraltar for Couta has more than onco been mooted, but whether i&quot;p would bo advisable or not to do so is of course primarily a military problem.   It may however be well to note hero.that Oouta is dominated by certain surrounding hills which are at present included in the international sono of Tangier * so that it would require tho assent cf franco to let thefee bo added to a British Oeuta.   So long as the agreement concerning the internationalization of Tangier is still unsigned, there might bo a chance of obtaining such French assent \7ithout having to pay an exorbitant price to Franco, tut lator on this would probably bo found quite impossible.   The cession of Gibraltar to Spain would doubtlocs&quot;oxorcisfc a most bene-fioial and lasting influence on our relations with Spain,&apos; but tlio importance of this might woll b6 exaggerated, for, If wo arc victorious in tho present war, thoro can bo little doubt1 that the material interests of Spain will impel her into the British orbit for many 3?ears to come.     Moreover&apos; the cession of Gibraltar would almost certainly bo oxeccd-ingly unpopular in Mngland.As regards Portugal it appears that tho phrase &quot;a freo hand in Portugal&quot; probably means that Spain does not.intend to annex Portugal, but to tie her by some sort of treaty.or alliance which would assure Spanish authority making itself felt in Portuguese counsels.     Such a solu-tion .would very likely not be detrimental to British interests for Portuguese misgovernment is a standing source of anxloty.     At the same time, however much we may suffer from the chaos which from time to time reigns in the Port\iguese Republic, and however oxaspcrating the Portuguese Government may be, there is no getting away from tho fact that Portugal is our oldest Ally, and that it would bo a gross breach of faith to promise Spain a froc hand in Portugal,   Hor could tho Allies, who are fighting for the rights of small lations, stand by and lot Spain impose conditions on Portugal, without themselves being pilloried in the eyes of tho world.   Thore is no reason to suppose that Portugal is onxidits to bind herself to Spain, but very much the reverse.Besides the conditions at which Spain has hinted might be added tho practical certainty that&quot;&quot; she would require a large loan on favourable terms, and would also claim from&apos;time to time various other forms of financial assistance.   This has been our experience with all our Allies, and Spain is hardly the country to prove tho first exception to the rule.The conclusion from the Foreign Office point of view can only be that the balance of advantage undoubtedly lies in Spain remaining neutral
