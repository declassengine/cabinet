This provides for a net reduction in imports of feeding stuffs of one million tons in 1917The principle of the programme is to give preference in import to articles.required for other purposes (such as oil seeds which it is assumed that the Ministry of Lunitions will continue to import in the same quantities as in 1916) or articles suitable for human as well as for Animal food, in particular maize.It is understood that the Board of Agriculture will take steps to advise farmers as to the best method of working on the reduced supplies of feeding stuffs available.From the returns collected by the Ministry, it appeared that about 2,000.000-qrs. of barley intended for malting were held by maltsters in the middle of February.     It is idtended to obtain a further return to ascertain the present qua-frli^yBARLEY   STOCKS.
