PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. &quot;1FOOD (WAR) COMMITTEE.KOYAL SOCIETY.March 16, 1917.THE NATIONAL FOOD POLICY.I.-THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE OF BREAD.1. Bread is the prime foodstuff of the working classes, and it is by the consump- The place tion of bread that the mass of people are enabled to produce their daily output of work. of b ?ad m It is impossible to ration bread without the gravest danger to the health and efficiency dasscon&quot;-of the poorer element of the population, as is shown by German experience during the sumption, present war.    While the average consumption of wheat flour in peace time was equivalent to 5^ lbs. of bread per head per week, the consumption in the poorer labouring classes has always been much higher, and at the present time rises as high as 10 lbs. per head per week in families which include men doing heavy physical work on low wages.   A considerable number of working men consume individually as much as 14 lbs. per week.    The poorer the individual or family, the greater is the actual consumption of bread, as well as the proportion it bears to the total dietary.    While among the middle classes bread supplies less than one-third of the energy of the total food they consume, with the poorer families of the working classes bread alone has to furnish more than half of the energy of their dietary.Practically no other food is as cheap as bread; that is, no other food generally available will enable a man to do as much work for the money he spends on food as bread will. The poor man is unable to replace deficiencies in bread by other foods, because all other foods he is accustomed to use will cost him more. As a matter of experience it is found that as bread and other foods rise in price, the poor man actually buys more bread than before, because it remains still the cheapest food available to him.The Committee wish, therefore, to insist that the first aim of the national food policy should be to maintain the supply of bread at its highest possible point, and to leave its consumption unrestricted.II.-THE PROBLEM OF SUPPLY.2. In considering the various problems connected with the supply and distribu- -Restricted tion of foodstuffs during the war we have been compelled to reconsider principles ay61^^11^ which are undoubtedly valid in normal times.   The considerations which ordinarily demand811 justify confidence in the stimulus of high prices on supply and their restraining effect on demand are, we recognise, to a considerable extent inapplicable at the present time.  The availability of supplies is conditioned even more by the difficulties of transport from the countries of production to the countries of consumption than by the offer of an attractive price for the goods in question.3. The position of this country is very different from that of Germany. Pundamen-Germany is limited to the quantities of the several foods which it can itself produce, tal import-supplemented by the limited quantities it can obtain from occupied territories fnce of and contiguous countries.   This country, on the other hand, has a large measure of        * choice, not only as between food and imports other than food, but also as between *the several forms of food.   It is limited as to the total amounts which can be procured mainly by considerations of the tonnage available for transport.   Until recently tonnage has been adequate for the maintenance of normal supplies of most(2742)
IWheat supplies.Nearer and more distant sources.Slaughter-ing of live stock.varieties of food materials. Should the anticipation of a further shortage of ship-ping be realised, we are of opinion that the rationing of food materials generally should not be resorted to until unessential imports, whether of foodstuffs or of other goods, have been completely eliminated. Attention should be concentrated on those articles that are vitally necessary. The first and by far the most important of these is wheat. In the case of most other food materials their distribution among the population can be left to the effects of price, provided that the supply of the fundamental food, bread, can be maintained.4. A few months ago the reports of the-probable quantities of wheat available during the harvest year indicated that the North American supplies would be so milch reduced from the level of recent,years that it would be necessary to have recourse to the supplies of the Southern Hemisphere in an unusual degree, in spite of the great disadvantage presented by the longer voyage involved. Since then, however, an important revision of the Canadian figures has been made which increases the available supplies from that country both from the crop of 1915 and from the crop of 1916 the aggregate increase amounting to 3,000,000 tons.* Further, the quantities which it has been found possible to obtain from the United States have been greater than appeared probable from the harvest estimates of that country, and visible supplies at United States centres are still reported as of sub-stantial magnitude and little less than at the same, period in 1914.1 It would consequently appear probable that the aggregate wheat supplies *of that part of the world now open to maritime trade are adequate to its needs. Moreover the necessity for drawing on very distant sources to the extent that had previously appeared unavoidable may be considered as removed.5. Our supplies ought no longer to be affected by the shortage of tonnage so far as that was due to the necessity for sending to Australia for wheat, since it now appears that this can be obtained in North America, It is true, that in order to secure Austra-lian supplies, contracts were entered into between the Imperial and the Commonwealth Governments, but we would urge that, rather than carry out those contracts at the expense of an adequate supply of wheat, an effort should be made to arrange a basis of pecuniary compensation to the Australian interests affected, so as to avoid the necessity of taking delivery of wheat in Australia so long as adequate supplies can be obtained at much less distant points. In our view the problem of compen-sation should present less difficulty than the problem of transport.Full advantage should, therefore, first be taken of the available supplies of wheat at the nearer sources. When the shipping at our disposal has been employed as advantageously as possible for this primary purpose, it may be feasible to employ such cargo space as may not be thus disposed of to obtain barley, maize or rice, also from nearer points of supply. The admixture of these other cereals with wheat for the purpose of bread-making to a substantially larger extent than has hitherto been prescribed should, we think, be adopted before any reduction in the quantity of bread consumed is decided upon.6. An additional supplement to our supply of breadstuffs may be secured by further reducing their use for feeding,animals an*d for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages. So far as these cereals have been used as foods for livestock, there is room for immediate economy by drawing more heavily upon our home meat supplies for the Army in training in this country and for civilian use; thus releasing tonnage which otherwise would be required to transport refrigerated meat, and, in addition, the tonnage needed to keep up the food supply of our livestock. Since the outbreak of war the herds of cattle and flocks of sheep have grown, t and when the choice lies between a moderate reduction in the present numbers of our stock and a reduction in bread supply we think there should be no hesitation in deciding in favour of the former alternative. Immediate slaughter would doubtless involve the difficulty that the preparation of animals for slaughter has only taken place in the customary pro-portion, so that to add to the number slaughtered would not be to add quite in the same proportion to the meat produced. The final stage of the preparation of animals for the market improves appearance and flavour much more than meat yield.* Figures furnished by the Canadian Government; see Supplement to Crop Eeport, Int.

480In the last stage of fattening, 15 lbs. of dry food, 4 lbs. of which are imported, . are consumed for the production of each additional pound of fat. We do not desire to suggest that a reduction in our supplies of meat-yielding animals should be made on the scale on which this was done in Germany in 1915, but, without proceeding to that extreme, it appears possible to add very substantially to our meat supplies from home sources.7. The prevalence of the idea that there is a special merit in reducing the amount of meat consumed constitutes a real danger, inasmuch as it is likely to cause an increased demand for cereal foods, to make up for the smaller consumption of meat. Thus economy in meat is likely to increase the strain on tonnage rather than to decrease it.8. It has already been announced that a further reduction is to be made in the Beer and quantity of beer produced; and this reduction, together with the reduction in the spirits, output of potable alcohol, should furnish a contribution towards providing the supplies of cereals by means of which the quantity of bread available may be main-tained even if the quantity of wheat imported should not be fully maintained. In our opinion no spirit at all should be manufactured in this country during the war beyond what is necessary for munitions purposes and for the provision of such a supply of yeast unobtainable as we understand from other sources as is absolutely necessary for bread-making. So far, moreover, as the former purpose is concerned, very serious attention should be directed to the possibility of converting to this use some part of the stock of spirit already in existence. The question of cost is alto-gether subordinate to the question of food supply and transport.9. We have referred above in a general way to the desirability of restricting Restrictions imports of the less essential commodities, whether foodstuffs or not, and in this on imports, connection we are of opinion that, unless there be grave counter-balancing considera-tions, the prohibition of the import of fruit, which has been announced, should be strictly maintained since, bulk for bulk, its nutritive value is far below that of wheat. In any case the licences which may be granted should be limited as far as possible to cases in which no other return cargo is obtainable. Similar considera-tions apply, in our view, in the case of other restrictions on imports included in the list recently made public; and we would particularly direct attention in this connec-tion to the items of paper, wood pulp and timber. By a rigid limitation of the use of paper and by a vigorous development of our domestic resources in timber there appear to be possible important economies in the demand for shipping space for imports, and no effort should be spared to realise them.10. It   appears  desirable   to   examine  the   magnitude   of   the   problem Considera-involved in the maintenance of the bread supply.   In recent weeks the usual informa- tion of tion as to imports and stocks at ports has not been made public; but from what was quantities published up to the middle of February^ it would appear that the stock of wheat and nSntain0 flour actually in this country at the present time is by no means inconsiderable in the1 supply relation to the requirements of the period between now and the new harvests in the of bread. Northern Hemisphere.    Taking into account the effect of the milling orders, and allowing for a probable economy in the uses of wheat and flour for purposes other than human food, the quantity required to provide for a supply of bread per head equal to that consumed prior to the war would appear to be not more than 550,000 quarters per week.   Between now and the end of August there are about 25 weeks, the require-ments for which on this scale would be somewhat under 14,000,000 quarters, or 3,000,000 tons, a figure approximately equal to the excess of the new over the old estimate of the resources of Canada.11. The estimates which have been put forward by trade organs! suggest that there may not improbably be in the hands of farmers and millers and in port ware-houses as much as half of the requirements of the next six months. Those figures may perhaps be somewhat exaggerated, and it must be remembered that such stocks* Board of Trade Journal, 15th February, 1917, and &quot; Corn Trade News,&quot; 22nd January, 1917. t E.g., &quot; Milling &quot; for 3rd March, 1917, p. 199.(2742) A 2
4cannot be wholly used up, except on condition that we are faced by imminent starva-tion.* It must not be overlooked, however, that there are also stocks of some magnitude in the hands of bakers and in private households.12. In the six months March to August of last year, the weight of all imports recorded in the monthly trade accounts was well in excess of 21,000,000 tons ;t and even though it should be supposed that during the next six months that weight might be reduced by as much as 25%, the aggregate imports of the six months would exceed 15,000,000 tons, or five times the weight of the wheat required for consumption in that period. It would consequently appear that if the maintenance of the supply of wheat becomes the primary consideration which governs policy, normal supplies should not fail to be provided.III.-THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTION.The result 13.

The requirements of nutrition vary with sex, age, and the character of the occupation. An absolutely uniform individual ration would be satisfactory only on condition that the people lived in families so constituted that a redistribution of the total family allowance according to needs could be effected by household management within each group. But such a redistribution is impossible with the existing differences in the constitution of families and the existing differences in the distribution of industries. Accordingly, a country which introduces a bread ration soon finds itself urged to grant supplementary rations to heavy workers and to adolescents. The administra-tive difficulties in determining who shall receive the supplementary rations are evidently considerable, and Germany has found itself compelled to distinguish further between &quot; laborious&quot; and &quot; very laborious&quot; employments. And if, with changing conditions of anticipated supply, the administration finds itself compelled, as in Germany, to reduce very considerably the number of supplementary rations, this is bound to give rise to discontent.14. Moreover, there are obvious reasons why it is hardly possible for a Govern-ment to enforce a system of bread rations without going much further rationing first meat and then all the other important foods. Bread occupies the dominant position in working-class households because it is not only the cheapest but also the most convenient form of food. Where it is bought already baked, as is the more general practice in this country, it requires no further cooking or preparation. Even when it is baked in the household the operation takes place at intervals of a few days. In consequence of its food value, combined with economy of labour and fuel, bread occupies a progressively larger place in the household budget the poorer the family. In families of the upper middle class it accounted before the war for less than 10% of the total expenditure on food; among skilled artisans it was about 15% ; among the bulk of the working classes it was over 21% 415. If the consumption of bread is rationed, there therefore quickly arises a popular complaint that the staple food most nearly approaching bread in nutritive value, viz., meat, is relatively too dear to be resorted to by the working classes in substitution, so that a restriction of bread alone is in effect a favouring of the more well-to-do classes.   The German Government has, of course, found it necessary to* The continuity of the processes of marketing and milling, including delivery, involves the presence of an irreducible quantity of material passing through those processes at any given time.f Annual Report of the Liverpool Steam Ship Owners&apos; Association for 1916, p. 32.% Board of Trade Eeport on &quot; Cost of Living hi the United Kingdom,&quot; 1906. Compare the collections of workmen&apos;s budgets by Mr. Charles Booth, the Economic Club, and Mr. Kowntree. From a physiological point of view, of course, the importance of bread to the population is far larger than these figures of money expenditure might suggest, and it is much greater to the working classes than to the middle classes.   See paragraph 1 above.
481yield to these representations and to ration meat also. Yet it is unavailing to fix the worker&apos;s ration at so many pounds of bread and so many pounds of meat if the worker is unable, owing to the price, to purchase the quantity of meat nominally at his disposal..16. This result will follow the more quickly when the working classes find it diffi- Potatoes, cult to obtain potatoes in the accustomed quantity. Potatoes, though not comparable, weight for weight, in nutritive qualities with bread or meat, come next to bread in their prominence in working-class consumption in the United Kingdom. In bulk they are much more important than any other item except bread. Failing bread, the working-class mother will seek to give her family potatoes. Any difficulty in obtain-ing them will intensify the demand that the more expensive foods shall be controlled.17. If the restriction as to bread is one of quantity only, and price is left to supply and demand, the distribution of the available supply can also be left to the existing agencies and the operation of the usual business motives. Granting that some restrictions were deemed necessary, it would probably be wise in this country to go no further for the time being than a restriction of quantity. Eationing could reduce the consumption, and therefore probably the price (or at any rate keep it below what it would otherwise become), without reducing it sufficiently to lessen the zeal of the farmer or importer to increase the supply.18. It must frankly be recognised that reliance cannot be placed on increase of Retail price to check consumption in the case of bread to anything like the same extent as in maximum the case of other foodstuffs. Bread is one of the most important examples of in- prices, elastic demand, i.e., of.a demand which does not readily increase or diminish as price falls or rises. Owing partly to the circumstance already referred to that, until very high prices indeed are reached, bread is the cheapest form in which nutriment can be obtained, and partly to ingrained habit, working-class families will cut down all other forms of food before they will dispense with their customary weekly purchase of bread. And it must be conceded that this consideration strengthens the argument in favour of maximum bread prices. Yet the experience of Germany has shown that it is impossible to abide by a system of maximum retail prices and not be compelled step by step to fix wholesale and growers&apos; prices, then to eliminate the merchant, and finally to take possession of the whole supply. German experience also shows that such action has invariably deceased production and checked supply. For the State to decide exactly when the farmer shall deliver his corn involves grave risk of mis-calculation and much irritating interference with the farmer&apos;s operations. On the other hand, to permit an increase of price on corn delivered in later months may end, as in Germany, in corn being unduly held up. And if the Government takes over the supply, it has to take over the whole business of milling, distribution, and transport.19. If a full normal supply of bread can be maintained the difficulties of the Thediffi-poorest class of consumers would appear to be capable of being substantially miti- cuities of gated by measures less open to objection than general rationing.    The situation ^agg^of81&quot; would, for example, be much improved for this class if the children under five years consumers, of age, who are largely dependent upon milk, can have a greater assurance of sup-plies.   The measure which it is understood is about to be introduced by the Local Government Board with reference to maternity and infant welfare centres would enable Local Authorities to provide or assist in providing milk and other foods for mothers and young children in any areas where this was required.   Some of these centres are already being used to ensure the necessary provision of sugar for such young children as are brought to them.   Such means of dealing with the distribution of foodstuffs of special importance to children would, if suitably developed, tend to mitigate the hardship resulting from leaving the distribution of foodstuffs as a whole to be determined by considerations of price.20. So far as bread is concerned, the greater part of the population would be The effect unlikely to increase their consumption of bread substantially even if the price were of price notably reduced.    Those who have adequate incomes, including those whose earn- uf)on the ings have increased owing to the great demand for labour for war purposes, are in a tkmo?^ position to secure, by payment, the supplies of bread which they deem necessary to bread.
.6their welfare. With regard to that section of the population who, because of inadequate incomes, may be subjected to great hardship owing to the high price of bread, it would appear that the problem of adequate provision for them is one which, being of much more moderate magnitude than the control of supply for the entire population, may be attempted with greater probability of successful handling. It is, further, to be noted that the experience obtained in the handling of this more limited problem would be of great assistance should it be found inevitable, at a later date, to undertake a control of the distribution of food for the entire population.SUMMARY.In view of the considerations set out above, the Committee emphasise the following points as the guiding principles of the National Food Policy : (1) That an unrestricted supply of bread should be maintained, whatever sacrifice of other imports may be necessary for the purpose.(2) That no restriction should be placed on the consumption of meat.(3) That home-grown meat should be used for the Army, Navy and civilians wherever possible.
