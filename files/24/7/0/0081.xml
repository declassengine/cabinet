In consequence, the already too brief period that remained for spring cultivation has been Still further curtailedand little season.more than 4 weeks remain beforetheend of the normalThis period is alltoo short to permit even the arrears to be overtaken, and it will be necessary, in the national interest, to prolong the ploughing season to the latest date compatible with the production of even moderate crops this year.     In view *f the grave shortage cf cereals, the sttcks of which are &quot;alarmingly 1*?;&quot; (to quote the Prime Ministers words), farmers must be persuaded, and If necessary required, to take risks which In normal times prudence might forbid.     It is Incum-bent upon this Department to give them ,advice and directions in connection with this matter, and in ample time for them t* act upon it.     This advice can best be given by the Advisory Committee and I hope to receive from them, at the earliest practicable date an authoritative pronouncement which can be circulated throughout tho country(a) as to tho latest date up tc which (in the special circumstances of this year) ploughing should be continued, in the various parts of England and Wales.(b) as to the nature of crops that could most profitably be raised upon the latest ploughed lands.I.

The scheme involves the appointment of a Horticultural Representative in each rural and urban district.     District War Agricultural Committees jointly with the Women&apos;s War Agricultural Committees are to be asked tc suggest names of persons willing to undertake voluntarily the duties of Horticultural Representative.The Commandants of auxiliary hospitals have been urged to arrange for the full cultivation of garden grounds and have been offered technical assistance.II.    TECHNICAL AND ADVISORYDuring the week housing accommodation has been found for this Division.     A meeting of the Technical Committee has been held and sub-committees have been set up to deal with the following points:-1.     Feeding Stuffs. To consider the whole position, as regards feeding stuffs, with a view to estimating what production of the available supplies should be allotted to each kind of stock, and suggesting how they may be fed to the best advantage.
3582.     Treatment of Grass Land.   To consider what steps can he ; taken to increase the feeding value of grass land.3.     Grtps and hachinery.   To consider the best crcps tegrow under the present circumstances and the best methods of applying machinery;4.     Fruit Drying.   To consider whether special arrangements should be made for drying fruit in the coming season and the most effective organisation for the purpose.Work is also proceeding with regard to plant diseases, milk production, cheese making, the best distribution cf fertilisers and the best means cf obtaining publicity for the work of the Division.III.    LABOUR.Soldier Labour - The reports received indicate that the men are being rapidly taken up in most counties.     Detailed reports have, however, as yet been received from only a few counties, but these show that during the week 664 soldiers of the Home Defence Force were applied for in 16 counties, and 301 are actually at work. -The reports from 14 counties show that 915 soldiers of the Agricultural Companies were applied for last week, and 330 are known to have been supplied.     These figures are, however, very incomplete and relate only to the end cf last week when the men were commencing to arrive at the depots.The War Agricultural Committees have guaranteed to place 7,430 soldiers of the Home Defence Force at once, and a further 1,650 men provided they are skilled, making a total cf 9,080.-    Others will be required later.     The War Office have given all Units in the United Kingdom instructions tc send any skilled ploughmen to their regular regimental depots, and officers commanding depots are held responsible for notifying local War Agricultural Committees that they are available.Prisoners of War - The War Office state that cne batch cf 75 prisoners is actually at work at Evesham, and another 75 will b;e sent to Toddington, Gloucester, on the 15th inst.     Four ether schemes will be completed very shortly.Women&apos;s Branch.All the travelling inspectors and all but 5 cf the County Organising Secretaries have now been appointed.     The local organisations are being completed with a view to being ready for the National Service recruits.     In Cambridgeshire, however, the ^organising secretary has met with some hostility from the Chairman of the Women&apos;s War Agricultural Committee.During the week fresh facilities   for training have been secured in Cumberland, Nottingham, Pembroke, and Norfolk. The East Kent VfomenTs War Agricultural Committee have secured the promise of premise^ for a hostel and training centre In St. Augustine&apos;s Priory, Canterbury.     These have been inspected by one of the officers of the Branch, who strongly urges that the Department should accept the offer.IV.
359IV.      SUPPLIESMachinery Section.-otor Tractors - Of the 515 tractors originally ordered from America 436 remain undelivered and there&apos; i:-: no definite news as to the date of their probable arrival.     Since the 1st March a further 30 tractors of other types have been ordered from America and 46 more have been purchased from agents in this country.     In addition, an arrangement has been come to with the Russian Government under which a large number of &quot;Caterpillar&quot; Tractors,&apos;. manufactured at Lincoln and awaiting shipment tc Russia, will be lent to this Department for agricultural work until the end of next month.     Of these, 14 have already been delivered.A serious difficult;- is the shortage of ploughs for these tractors.     631 have been ordered;    of these.95 only have been delivered, but it is expected that a further 352 will be available for spring ploughing.     The greater number of these have been secured since the 1st March from retail dealers in the country *Upwards of 40 mechanics have received special instruction in the,use and control of &quot;Caterpillar&quot; tractors. 43 district prganisers and 25 motor engineers have been appointed for the care of the tractors already delivered to ftar Agricultural Committees.1,600 private owners of tractors have been individually and directly communicated with, with the r-esult that 56 tractors have been placed under the control of the Department.     Taking Government owned and controlled tractors together, 146 have been dispatched and should be at work;,   a few of these are not working for various causes, but it is expected that by the end of the week at least 150 will be ploughing, and in the majority of cases, these will be at work night and day.Many hundreds of offers of help.In staffing tractors have been received, considered, and referred to district organisers.     As a general principle it may be said that there is no difficulty in procuring the necessary labour from civilian sources,   and already several of the operators furnish-ed by.the A.S.C.. have been returned tc their military duties,The organisation of supplies of fuel, lubricating oil and spare parts from civilian sources is also working satis-factorily.Steam Tackle - 118 applications for the return to civil employment in-connection v^ith steam cultivation have been made/ to the ?far Office.     Replies have been received in respect of 41 men, from which it is understood that 39 will be discharged from the Army,The Liverpool Corporation, in conjunction with Messrs. Blake k Company, motor engineers, are starting a training school for drivers and ploughmen.     The Battersea Polytechnic is also doing useful work in this connection and it is hooed to induce ether organisations in different parts cf the Country to provide training centres.Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. oulphate of Ammonia - A scheme for the payment of the GovernmentGrant
Grant and a scheme for facilitating and improving the distribu-tion of supplies have been prepared.     These schemes are now being considered by the Sulphate of Ammonia Advisory Committee.The monthly returns of Sulphate of Ammonia makers show that 20,000 tons were delivered for agricultural use during February In the same month last year the quantity was just over 10,000 tens. The production is being well maintained.It is proposed that an Order fixing the price cf Sulphate of Ammonia should be passed, and the concurrence of the Ministry of Munitions is being obtained.Basic Slag - A scheme has been prepared for regulating the price at which basic slag is to be sold.     The Ministry of hunitiens are being consulted on this in the first instance.The deliveries of basic slag in February amounted to 34,600 tons as against 38,600 tons in January.     At most of the works the stocks held are new quite small, the slag being deliver-ed as soon as it is ground.Superphosphate - An offer bo sell 30,000 tons of superphosphate now at Lisbon has been received and arrangements to purchase the whele or part of this quantity are being made. The Kinistry of Shipping have undertaken to provide freight fcr 15,000 tons, and an effort will be made to bring as much as possible in time for this season&apos;s crcp. Confirmation of the terms of sale is being obtained from Lisbon.Waize - The prospects of the future supplies of maize are unsatisfactory and stocks are small.     The question ef the best means of regulating the price so as to prevent profiteering is being considered with the Wheat Commission.     Immediate action in this direction seems necessary and a scheme has been drafted. The regulation of distribution is also being discussed.Seed Section.Seed Potatoes - The total supply of seed promised by dealers in the United Kingdom up to the present, including 150 tens frcm Ireland, does not exceed 8,500 tons.     Enquiries made in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire through large merchants have net resulted in any addition to the stcck.     An additional order for 250 tons hat , however, been placed in Scotland.Arrangements have been made with the Irish Department for the. issue of export licences for 5,000 tens;    and every endeavour is being made to purchase without delay.     The authority of the Food Controller has been obtained to pay  10 per ton as Irish farmers are holding out for this amoun^.     It is anticipated that this will at once release supplies.A feature of the correspondence received during the week has been the evidence which it affords cf the shortage of potato seed required to meet the needs of farmers, and this emphasises the extreme importance cf securing further supplies from Ireland.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,ft -Hon.Rowland E.Prothere, M.P.

In 56 cases inquiry shoved that swine fever existed.    In the remainder - 34 - swine fever was not found to exist.Anthrax material in connection with 12 reported outbreaks was the subject of investigation.    In 10 of these cases it was found to exist.    In the remainder - 2 - the report was found to have arisen from other causes.Anti-swine fever serum..    During the week in question 3,600 cc. were issued for distribution to keep up the stocks at the various centres.Anti-abortion vaccine.    During the week in question 13,000 c. c. &quot;[2&amp;0 dosesj have been manufactured, put up in a suitable form, and despatched for use on infected farms.

IIany of tie returns furnished by the War Office are inaccurate and incomplete and the result is that many journeys are made and much time wasted in going to see men whose stations h\ve been changed.HORTICULTURE BRANCH.The break up of t.ie frost has released a large number of potatoes from the pits,  and. although by no means all the dealers are full? supplied yet with their stocks, a great quantity of &quot;seed&quot; potatoes have been offered to the public. Applications for licences are consequently coming in very much faster and we have dealt with 1,157 during tie last week and 2,064 since the end of last month.The delivery of a large supply of seed potatoes in South v/n,ies, where eating -potatoes are practically non-existent led     once tc the illegal consumption of seed potatoes for cooking.    By the energetic action of one of our Inspectors, couoled with help from the Glamorgan County Constabulary,  (who, . until informed by our Inspector,  did not know of the existence of the 7ood Controller&apos;s Order) a stop has been put tc this practice,  at any rate openly.    luvt ler steps are being taken to see that the seed potatoes whiai are urgently wanted for planting on premises infected with V/art Disease are not prematurely washed.EDUCATION BRANCH.The main work of tne 3ranc.i h^.s been in connection with the payment of claims for grants for tie year 1915-16.Correspondence in connection with the schemes for increasing the production of JJggs and Cheese has also been dealt with.PUBLICATIONS.

About 2100 applications for leaflets were received during the week,  and about 20,000 copies of leaflets were sent out.    About 830 Bound Volumes of leaflets at 1/- each or 2/6 for a set of 3 were sold - this being an increase of 230 over last week.    Numbers of applications for t.ie posters describing publications continued to be received from War Agricultural Committees,  for distribution hy the Sub-Committees in their Districts;    and several leaflets have been either revised or re-printed.COiagSKCIAL CONTROL BRANCH.Owing to the transfer of Mr. Haygarth Brown and Mr, Humby to the Food production Department,  the staff of the Commercial Control Branch now consists of a General Inspector (Acting Head of Branch), a Second Division Clerk and a Temporary Woman Clerk.The Branch.has been principally engaged in correspondence as to railway facilities for various consignments of manures, feeding stuffs, fish and empties;    the alteration of train services to meet the exigencies of milk traffic;    fancy names for margarine;    and prosecutions under the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.   The Board&apos;s consent to a prosecution under the Act has been issued during the week in respect of an application from the Local Authority for Buckinghamshire.FART.

5Conference with Naval Authorities.STAFF AH) ACCOMMODATION.An unfortunate outbreak of illness (measles, etc.) has reduced the Staff this week.There is a great congestion of work owing to the serious depletion of the Staff for Naval and military service, and for speoial war duties.   There are now only three officers left out of a normal clerical staff of 11 who are acquainted with the technical and varied work of the Division which is concerned with the administration of over forty Acts of&quot; Parliament -any new assistant therefore must go though a long apprenticeship before he is of      much service. Endeavours are being made to secure male clerical assistance, and promising candidates have been interviewed.   Two more women clerks were engaged. Further accommodation is urgently desired preferably by annexing rooms at 43,Parliament Street vacated by the Accounts Branch.STATISTICAL    BRANCH.All the envelopes for the Prime Minister1   appeal to farmers were addressed by the Stock Lkcehange, under the general supervi3ion of a Staff Clerk from this 3ranch, during the 4 days March 6-9.The monthly Return of Sea Fisheries (issued on 12th March) showed 211,000 *?wt, of wet fish landed in England and wales in February as compared with 223,000 in February 1916. The value was slightly greater.   The chief changes, as compared with 12 months ago, were an increase in the quantity of cod, and an increase in the price of prime fish.The provisions trade has been rather unsettled by the announcement of nis.simum prices; and prices are lower, and falling into line with the regulations.TITHE   AND   COPYHOLD.During the past week further progress has been made with many of the Altered Appointments, Mergers, or Redemptions of Tithe Rentcharge which are in hand; nine Redemptions have been brought to completion.   Attention has also been given to the Enfranchisements of Copyholds which are now proceeding.The receipt of new applications for each of the above kinds of transaction has continued steadily.CHIEF
