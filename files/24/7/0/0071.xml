CONFIDENTIAL.322IMPERIAL WAR CABINET.Memorandum on question of Indian Immigration into acquired territory in German East Africa and German possessions in the Pacific.Some anxiety lias already been expressed in India as to the prospects of Indian immigration into any territory that may be acquired in East Africa.The Government of India report1 thati Secret letter- No. 85, Foreign, dated    j j ^ expressed   in India,29th January 1916. ,x\      ,   , , ,  ,     &apos;J that whatever   may   be   the  futureadministration of German East Africa, arrangements will be made to admit of Indian immigration on equitable terms.In British East Africa the Highlands have been reserved for European settlement (subject to existing Native rights), and there is some possibility that, in the event of the annexation of German East Africa, similar regula-tions may be made without any serious consideration. While it is understood that in the German territory the Native African population is concentrated chiefly in the uplands, which afford a suitable field&apos; for European planters, so that it may very well be the case that for economic and other reasons a large influx of Indians into these uplands would not be in the best interests of the territory as a whole, it is important from the Indian point of view that no measures of restriction should be adopted without full discussion.It seems clear, on the other hand, that the lower territories, unsuitable for European settlement and sparsely inhabited by Natives, afford  a verys The fact that Mesopotamia is not   favourable field for Indian colonisation,2regarded by the Government of India as and that the entry of Indian agricul-suitable for Indian colonisation accentuates turists would tend tO the development the desire for an opening in East Africa.        Qf ^ country and to the improvementof Native methods of agriculture.   Sir Theodore Morison, now in German East Africa, has pointed out that for the plains the Indian agriculturist is the ideal small settler from the economic point of view, as the climate suits him and the land, which he would clear, produces most of the crops &apos;vexcept rice) grown in India.   While the German system of what is practically forced labour for European plantations is most unpopular, and does not teach the Natives anything that they can aryply to their own agriculture, the introduction of the Indian plough would be of great benefit to the Africans, while their primitive crafts for instance, blacksmiths&apos; work and charcoal burning would be much improved by the adoption of the simple Indian methods and implements, which the Native can readily understand. &apos; The share taken by Indian troops in the East African campaign constitutes a strong argument for the opening of the country to Indian settlement.   It is also to be remembered that for centuries past the East Coast of Africa has been freely visited by Indian traders, and that before the establishment of European Protectorates on the coast and the hinterland Indians had, under Mohammedan Arab rule, established a position for them-selves.   This fact was recognised by the German Government, who, in .1912, discouraged an anti-Indian agitation which had for the preceding live years arisen in certain quarters.   His Highness the Aga Khan has pointed out the vital importance to Western India of East Africa.   He estimates the local commercial interests of his own followers, the Khoja community, as representing, if capitalised, over 2,000,0001., and thinks that this sum represents only about one-third of the business interests of Indians in German East Africa.   His Highness has urged  that in the Bombay Presidency intense feeling would at once be aroused if- Indians were not allowed to share in the advantages won for the Empire in East Africa, and that this feeling would be shared by the rest of India as soon as the position was understood.S 347-2   50-3/17
9The question of Indian immigration may also arise as regards newly-acquired territories in- the Pacific. In German Samoa very exceptional concessions were made to Chinese settlers on account of the scarcity of local labour. Indians now form about one quarter of the total population of Fiji, and a tendency to migrate to other groups of islands may be expected. But the Indian claim to participate in any advantages secured by the Empire in East Africa stands on a fax- stronger basis than any request that may be advanced as regards the Pacific.India Office, 26th February 1917.
