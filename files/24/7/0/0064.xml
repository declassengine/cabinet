r/^/^      291ggC HE T. - - Copy Ho. j    \       JG.3J.I64. BAR CABIHEAssistance which might Jae rendered &quot;by Spain in the event of her joining the Allies.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Munitions.The following Fomcr a: dum has been prepared in accordance with the decision ox the War Cabinet on the 8th.Msrch 1917 (War Cabinet 91 Minute 10). A number of members of the staff of the Ministry have &quot;been consulted in its preparation including Mr.Fielding and Mr.Macleod &quot;both of whom have large interests in Spain, end an intimate knowledge of the conditions in that country. I would suggest that if the matter is further discussed by the War Cabinet it might be advantageous for them to summon one of these gentlemen in order to hear his views.&apos;(Initialled)    C.A.Memorandum.The position may be summarised by saying that from the supply point of view there is little to he gained by Spain joining the Allies rather than/preserving a benevolent neutrality. b37Her joining the Allies would, however, give a definite assurance against her joining the enemy powers and&apos; as will be seen from the details given below a hostile attitude on the part of Spain would be disastrous to the Allies, as it would stop the production of explosives within three months and would cut off some two-thirds or more of our total supplies of iron ore.The following list nves particulars of supplies obtained from Spain in a ivugh order of urgency :(1)     PYRITES.     All European supplies of Explosives are entirely dependent on pyrites obtained from Spain and the United States supplies are also dependent to a very large extent. England obtains one million tons a year from Spain together with &amp; slight amount from other sources and we are also arranging tonnage for the.export from Spain of three or four hundred &apos; thousand tons to the United States.     About two-thirds of our plants for the manufacture of sulphuric acid are pyrites plants end it would take many months to change over to plants capable of using sulphur.(2)     IRON ORE,   About two-thirds of our total iron ore imports come from Spain, i.e. roughly 450,000 tons per month.(3)     SHIPPING.   Spanish ships engaged in the iron ore trade have been withdrawn since the beginning of February, -leven steamers representing 32,600 tons have been lying loaded in ports since the beginning of February and some of these have actually had their cargoes discharged in order that they might be used for coast trade purposes.     Cut of 4-9 ships chartered for Spain and the Mediterranean for week ending March 10th. only one was Spanish.     Shipments of iron ore are very irregular at present and little reliance can be placed- on the. date of their
29214. 3. 17.reoeipt.     It will be seen from the attached table that total imports have kept up satisfactorily recently.     This has only &quot;been effected by withdrawing non-Spanish boats from other services to replace the Spanish-&quot;boats lying in ports.     At present we are offering Spanish owners war risk insurances and are also negotiating for the purchase of ships with the &quot;&apos;pa::.;i?Ii Government but the terms&apos; wPich they offer are very stiff.     If Spain joined the Allied powers she would he free to arm her ships and the purpose of present negotiations Is to obtain control of her ships in order to he able to arm them ourselves, if possible.     If Spain joined it would no doubt be possible to exercise more political pressure in order to obtain control of the Spanish ships and encourage owners to complete and carry out existing contracts.     If these contracts were carried out it would make it unnecessary tp open up home iron ore supplies.     There are some indications that Spanish ships are now inclined to sail and one Spanish ship held up in an English port is now sailing.     Besides Spanish ships already chartered for ore purposes there are no doubt others which could &quot;be obtained end there is also e large number of German ships interned in the various ports.     Further, if Spain definitely joined the Allies she could no doubt do much by the use of her Navy and in other ways to minimise present losses from submarines round her coast.(4*     LABOUR.       It is thought that Spain may be in a position to help in this direction but there are doubts as to the efficiency of her labourers.     It is understood that a consider-able amount of Spanish labour from the notth of Spain was used in the construction of the Panama canal.(5)     LEAD.. Spanish supplies of this metal are ofvery great importance in view of the present shortage of supplies. The Penaroya mines supply large quantities to Russia and Prance and the bulic of the balance, i.e. 2000 tons per month is talien by Great Britain.     Supplies of this metal from Spain are 0oming in with fair regularity.( 6)     COPPER.       About 401000 tons per an-;urn are produced in Spain of which nearly all goes to the Allies.(?) It is thought that it would be possibleto obtain increased supplies from Spain,(Q)     QUICKSILVER. About 60$ of the world&apos;3 supplies come from Spain.In conclusion, it may be mentioned that(l) Factories in Spain are making considerable quantities of Small Arms Ammunition for Prance.(2) Bilbao is providing steel and steel plate for France.(3) Barcelona is racking cotton goods for Prance.(4) S:*ain is entirely dependent on the Allies for supplies of coal, which gives&apos; a very important lever in negotiations.
Total fixtures for Spain and Mediterranean Ores, for January were   668,000 tons (4 weeks)&quot;   February   &quot;     490,000 tons (d- weeks)&quot;   two wee Irs ending March 10th,   293,000 tons      (2 weeks)Total Ionorts from Spain and Mediterranean, have beenDecember        400,000 tons January 380,000 tons,3fc&quot;biuary&apos;       412,000 teas
