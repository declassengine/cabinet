elme Radcliffe to Sir W. Robertson.SECRET.43March 14th 1917,863, Secret and personal. This evening I saw General Gadorna in Val Lagarina,.   He greatly regrets that you v/ere unable to come as20th and 24th,    He would be grateful to have by telegraph your views on the memorandum he sent you, which was a translation of the memorandum he sent to.General Nivelle,General Cadorna thinks that the German retirement on Western front, if continued, will have created a new situation.   He thinks Germans will not be averse to surrendering some French or Belgian territory if by so doing they are enabled to obtain other advantages. He thinks German troops may retire 6 or 8 kilometres at a time on previously prepared successive positions, and using inferior forces may avoid defeat in the West fmr some months and economise many Divisions for employment elsewhere.   General Cadorna thinks this a sound manoeuvre, and one that he would endeavour to carry out were he in the position of the Germans.    If the Germans decide to attack they may, with Austrian Army, have about 90 Divisions available for the purpose which, with a very superior artillery, would be overwhelming,   If Germans adopt retard-ing tactics he thinks British and French attempts to relieve Italy by attacking in the West might not acnieve their object, and that the only effective help would be by means of direct support in Italy of about 20 French or British Divisions with plenty of heavy artilleryc    In a few weeks it should be possible to make sure what are the German intentions, but time is short for making fresh arrangements, and Gen.Cadorna thinks that steps should be taken at once so that, in case of necessity, French or British reinforce-ments may reach Italy in time and under conditions allowing of their immediate employment.   He points out that operations are feasible in the Trentino probably by May 15th, possibly by May 1st,previously arranged, but hopes that you can come between Marchbut
but certainly not before April 15th.   &apos; On the Isonzo front lie could begin operations at once, but cannot engage himself there too deeply until the situation is clear ao regards Trontino. He thinks that if some 20 French or British Divisions are ear-marked for (group omitted) in Italy and If steps arc taken immediately to vrork out a plan of operations, liaisons, roc on-naissancec, transport) etc., it would be possible to forestall and defeat any attempt the Central Powers night make against Italy, as the French and. Italian Railway Communications v.rould per:ait of norc rapid concentration than those of the Central Powersy even as far as the Isonzo,.There is at present no proof of a German concentration near the Italian Front, but Auctrians have made elaborate preparations in the matter of railway communications, roads and supply, which would render such concentration possible.     Hany indications now confirm the idea that an Austrc-German combination against Italy is at least probable.General Cadorna thinks it advisable that the above should be seriously considered; as a defeat of Italian Army would be a severe blow to the Ententef more especially as certain influences in the country might then be successful In bringing about a separate peaceMr
