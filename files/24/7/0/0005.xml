Graham Greene to SirR.P.A.Hankey.anG, a memorandum nv the Admiralty.; regarding the addition-al number b.f Torpodi Boat Destroyers which, could he-completed by end of next year).Y.y dear Hanke-r, -.; I send you a memQrandum relatin&quot; to the minute of the War Cabinet cn the 8th February last in regard to the additional number of.Torpedo Boat Destroyers which could be completed by -the end of next year.The mernranduv- gives particulars of the firms with which the ;Destroyers coulc; be laid down.&apos;/which include the four firms tv-e employment of which: would net, in the -opinion of the Controller of Shipping, interfere materially with merchant shipbuilding.    ...:.: -In th- se circumstances the R*ard consider that the programme of-&apos; shipbuilding approved by the Cabinet should in-clude a total number of 49Destroyers and Fletilla Leaders to be laid down for completion next year.a I am desired to take ,this opportunity of mentioning that the First.-. Sea Lircl.&apos; s programme &apos;!C&quot;, w^ich was submitted to the Cabinet, inadvertently omitted 6 Patrol Boats which ^ere laid dorn under the programme approvec  by the Cabinet in Fovemher last.   That pro^ramr-e provided for the building of 12 Patrol Boats to be laid downat the rate of two a month -duringa the next six months,   &quot;hen the First &quot;Jea Lord put his programme before the Cabinet, he did not think it necessary to proceed vlth the remaining 6 ratrcl Boats, and a note to that effect was made in the minutes of the proceedinrs, hut no note was made of tve 6 vessels already under construction.As the Treasure have raised the question, I shall be glad if you wilTa&quot;have a formal&apos;note made so &apos;that---there may be ; . no further misunderstanding on the subject.------- Tours sincerely,( S&quot;&quot;d) &apos;&quot;&apos;. Graham Greene ../ &apos;.;:h-;-V .&apos;:     IIE1&apos;0R V DLL ;.In accordance --with the. minute of -the Lar Cabinet on the 8th February last,  the. question -of - what additional number if Torpedo Boat Destroyers and   lotilla Leaders could he completed hy Decey-her lOia h-\o &quot;been considered. . - aThere are at present time 15 Firms building Flotilla Leaders or- destroyers.    These Firms fall into two main Croups;-
(1) Specialist Destroyer Builders.( a) Destroyer Bui 1 ders^ 8:Jvesigners. Thornycroft mite Yarrow   .(b) Admiralty Firms, building JDestrc as&quot;&apos;well as ether vessels *Swan Hunter &amp; Co Paii.iers Ge. Cammell Laird and C o.Fairf ield&apos; 8. Co.    Hawthorn Leslie,DennyJ&apos;. Brown &amp; Co. Beardmore(2) Firms-who do nojt make a special feature of &quot;-destroyer Milling.DoxfordHarland r Wolff (Govan) Stephen     SenScott e:  Co.In order to increase the output of Destroyers, the Firms under (2) were given orders early in the v/ar.    Messrs Doxford and Hessrs Stephen were ordinary Merchant Ship build-ers, Messrs Harland 8- Wolff had acquired the premises of the London and Glassgow Co. where Destroyers had. been built in former years and Messrs 3cctt r Co. had previously done a good deal of other work for the Admiralty, hThe first Destroyers produced by.these Firms took a very -long -time to build., : but experience has now. been gained, and the ^irms are turning out vessels verysatisfactorily and&apos; in good time. .In order . that they might make greater progress on Merchant Shipbuilding, Messrs Harland c Wolff have not been given orders for Destroyers 3ince liarch 1916,  and Lerchant Ship building would certainly benefit if the other two /Firms/ Stephen and:Doxford were -allowed to revert to that class of work as well.By allowing this,..however,   the experience these firms have gained.in Destroyer Building would be lost./More-over during the Y/ar assistance has been, given to.&apos;Messrs Doxford to develop plant for the- construction of turbines and: water-tube boilers.    This plant as re 11 as to a great extent that of Messrs Richardson Westgarth, will remain unemployed; by the Havy if kessrs Doxford build no Destroyers; though.-, it will.be employed to a certain degree -for Merchant Ship-building.It is considered that the two groups of Firms could, if desired, produce the following numbers of Torpedo Boat Destroyers and Flotilla Leaders by the end of December;1918.(l) Specialists ..... v..... 39 (2) War Firms  ............... 10Total       49
&apos;The-Joint Shipbuilding Delegation and the Controller &apos; tf Shipping&apos; to who??/the matter has been referred do. not con-aider&apos; that the employment of the four firms in the second group would interfere, materially with the output of merchant tonnage.Admiralty.5th ilarch, 1917.
