MSTEY   OF   FEMSIOhSiF:cport for Period, from the ICth March to the 16th March.1, The report stage of the &quot;Civil Services?s SupplementaryEstimates, 1916-17, Ministry of Pensions&quot;, which was to have beeni takenon the 12th instant was not reached on that day nor laterI in the week.     There will no doubt, be further discussion on thaton the Draft Warrant and Order in Council,, as though&apos;observations in&apos;the. newspapers continue to be generally favourable, Curtain provisions have been attacked, notably in the papers through which Mr, Hogge conducts his pensions campaign,   Tho chief of. these points is the hintstor&apos; s refusal to consider the grant of a pension for life to a man whose disablement is ascertained to be neither attributable to nor aggravated by the War.      In the meantime a few minor .alterations are being made to the drafts with the consent of the Treasury, of which the principal is to makensionable the woman who has lost not only a soldier-son during the War but also the husband on whom she was dependent. 2,:. The principles on which the Warrants dealing withretired pay granted to disabled officers and pensions to the widows and families of deceased officers are to be revised, were considered at a conference with the Minister &apos;s&apos; Statutory Advisers on the 10th instant.     A copy of the proceedings of that eon-ference are annexed as Appendix I to this memorandum, 3. Arrangements in detail have been made between theMinistry, the Admiralty, and the War Office a and submitted to the Treasury; for approval, for the delimitation of the Pension cases of seamen, marines and soldiers, and of their families and dependants between the departments and for the accounting questions involved.     Similar arrangements for the cases of officers and their families are under consideration.The
3 HThe leading features of the arrangements are as follows (1)   Pensions granted on the occasion of disablement will be charged wholly to the Votes of the Ministry, even though regard may be had to &quot;service&quot; in their computation.     It is obviously undesirable to have either two separate Issues to the same person, or to divide each weekly Issue between two departments, (2)   The Admiralty and War Office will continue to issue the pre-war disablement pensions, which under the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916, have to be transferred to the Votes of the Ministry, and recover the amounts issued;   the War Office by a detailed account, the Admiralty, (for the present) upon an estimate based upsn their records and corrected for casualties as they occur. These pensions are issued upon the quarterly system, and it is economical of labour to leave &quot;them on the books of the departments concerned, to be paid by a staff whose work dovetails in with other departmental work, so that they they can be profitably employed during the slack season which necessarily occurs in pension v/ork under a quarterly system.(3)   Conversely the Ministry will Issue for and recover from the Admiralty and War Office service pensions issued weekly, and so save thc-se departments the trouble (at any rate till after the war) of setting up the machinery for weekly issues, which is most economical when It is upon a large scale,.like at the Pension Issue Office of the Ministry,     This arrangement has also the advantage of making one combined payment to any man who Is entitled to both a service and a disablement pension   -4,   The
3944.        Tho Naval and Military Mar Pensions etc, (Administrative Expenses) Bill, the second reading of which was due to be taken on the loth instant had to be postponed owing to pressure of other parliamentary busi-ness.Representations having been received from the Metropolitan Borough in favour of the formation of either District Committees or separate Local Committees for.each Borough, a conference between representatives of these Boroughs, the London County Council and the County-Y-ar Pensions Committee was held on the 14th instant, at which the Minister was by Invitation present.   The County Committee organised its area by means of Sub-Committees ir the Spring of last year, and, this arrangement having boon found in practice to work satisfactorily, it is felt by the County Council and the County Committees that it would be very undesirable to disturb it at the present time, The Minister suggested that the Metropolitan Borough Councils should associate themselves to a greater extent than they had hitherto done with the work of the Sub-Committees and the London Coiimiittee,5. In consequence of the retirement of 3.R.H. thePrince of Males from the Chairmanship of the Statutory Committee, a re-arrangement of the posts of Chairman and Vice Chairman has become necessary.    It has been arranged that in the event of Mr. Cyril Jackson becoming chairman, Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen shall become Vice-Chairman.   This will involve an amendment of the Naval and Military Mar Pensions Act, 1915, to obviate the necessity for Sir Arthur QriffIth-Boscawen1s re-election.A report of the Statutory Committee giving details of the work done by them in the week is annexed as Appendix II.     They had under consideration the treatment of advanced tuberculous cases in Scotland and Ireland, andfinally
39finally approved on Llarch 13th, schemes for training in Ayrshire and Oxfordshire.   Records they had obtained   . showed that  94 men had been and 51 are being trained in London centres.     A detailed statement of the Training and Employment Section of the Statutory Committee forms Appendix III to this report.6. .In paragraph 16 of the memorandum on thearrangements for the treatment and training of disabled soldiers, which was submitted to the Prime Minister on the 5th February last, reference was made to advisory Boards consisting of representatives of Employers Trade Unions, and Local War Pensions Committees, who were to settle difficulties in assessing the wages cf disabled men, and to make Investigations into the industries on which those men can most suitably be employed in different localities,&apos;Appendix IV of this report gives a list drawn up on the 9th instant by the Minister of Labour, of Committees either formed or under consideration, ana Appendix V indicates the constitution and functions of these Committees,Pamphlets dealing with the industries on which disabled men can most suitably be employed have been pre-pared for submission to these Joints Trade and Advisory Committees and Appendix VI is a Specimen of such pamph-let dealing with Attendants at Electrical Stations. V. In order to keep more closely in touch with theprogress of Training schemes arranged by the Statutory Committee and the Local War Pensions Committees all over the country, and to be In a better position to ensure advantage being taken of these schemes by the men intended to be benefitted by them, the Minister has, with the cordial consent of the Governors of the London Polytechnic,appointed
396appointed Major Robert Mitchell, Director of Education at that Institution, to bo his Advisor in matters of Training and Employment,.8.       After some doubtless unavoidable delay, the War Office issued on the loth instant an Army Council Instruction, (Appendix V.II) to give effect to the arrange-ments for the treatment of disabled men on their being invalided from the Army, referred to in Paragraphs 1 to 5 of the Memorandum of the 5th February.   The ministry have received an intimation that the limitation to the retention of discharged men in military hospitals ex-pressed by the words &quot;so long as...,,, accommodation is available&quot; is likely soon to become effective in view of the scarcity of hospital beds in this country compared with the probable requirements of the immediately coming months..   The fact that men may be sent out of hospital when- really they should continue to be having in-patient treatment enhances the importance of getting them out-patient treatment without any delay on their return to their homes, and the organisation for this is receiving the careful consideration of the Ministry and the St atut o ry C ommittee.9, In connection with the treatment of men aftertheir discharge and also with the temporary allowances that pa.rtially disabled men may require when Incapable of work by reason of their disablement, the question of medical referees to check the certificates of the doctors   j that may be employed by the men has been under discussion, and the Minister has invited the National Health Insurance Commissioners to advise as to the best means to be adopted to secure medical practitioners qualifiedt0   - j
3to undertake this work in those districts,, where the organisation of the Military Hospitals may not be readily available.10,     The Minister of Pensions had a conference with the representatives of the KationalHealth Insurance Joint Committee on the 15th instant in the matters set forth in Appendix, VIII to this Report, involving amendments to the National   Health Insurance (Part I) Amendment Act, 1915, in consequence of the substance and form of certain pension provisions of the New Royal Warrant and Order in Council. Tho amendments; proposed will enable a man to re-enter into insurance whatever may be the degree of his disablement so long as he can qualify for this by periods of employment and contribution.     It would also be provided that in certain cases in which it is considered that the interests of the man require that lie should be given a gratuity rather than a pension lie should also receive sickness benefit,- in a lump sum instead of by weekly payments.     The Commissioners propose in consultation with the Ministry to draft a Bill for immediate presentation to Parliament, embodying these amendments.11. At the 5th meeting of the Committee on Institutional Treatment held on the 12th March, the methods of financing with Red Cross funds and administering Hospitals provided   by the Committee were discussed,/and Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen. and Mr Flynn were appointed Trustees in this connection. Certain arrangements were ma.de with reference to epileptics at Chalfont St, Giles and the feasibility of the Statutory Committee taking charge of the property at Claremont, acquired for advanced cases of Tuberculosis   was considered12.     A return submitted with last weekrs report showed that up to the 28th February there were 5592 cases of mendischarged
398dischargedin which-there had&quot; he en,, amput at ion s 0     The Report-from the Central Registry for limbless Soldiers anA. &amp; -4.3^ra:--cap-&quot;*kc-that date, since received,   gives 7&apos;54-5 as the number of artif1-clal limbs that had been supplied or were on order - a number of these having been furnished to men not yet discharged.     5&apos;97&apos;9 undischarged men had had limbs amputated hut had not yet been fitted for artificial i ir s;   7/99 of them were ready to be fitted,- The number of men who were discharged from Roehampton in February having received limbs was 467&apos;,,13.     The number of men admitted to the Blinded Soldiers * and sailors-! Hostel., St   Dunstan: s Regents Park to the end of February was 525, 210 of whom had passed through.     Of this number 173 had been fully trained and had been set up.     The remaining 37\ for some reason in connection with health or habits- 3.eft untrained or untrainable.     Of these, come nervous cases will return for training when their condition is suf-ficiently Improved.       On March 1st 31,5 men were in St, Dunstan&apos;s or at its various annexes.       Included in these numbers are 45 Colonials, 11 of whom have left,The numberof Officers who up to the 28th February had been under care at St, Dunstan?s, including 4 Colonials, was 31, 12 of these had passed through, including 2 Colonials.14.     Table I shows that 98a9 pensions (including children^ allowances) were granted during the week against 8,4.17/ during the previous week and that 548,139 have been awarded from the commencement of the War up to the 14th instant.     Table II shows that during the last week 191 grants of supplementary pensions and temporary allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 177 in the previous week and that the total up to date is 207&apos;5.15
33915.     Table III shows that ,&apos;uhe staff of the Ministry (not in-? eluding that of the Statutory Committee) 2 ,.513 and consists of 197 men and 2316 women,-, some additional women havingr been taken on during the week for awards and issues   to soldiers.There is a great need for a corresponding addition   to be made in the branch for a?^ards to Widows and Dependants but for the moment this is not possible as the available accommodation at the Tate G-allery where this work is carried on is already greatly over-crowded and the Office of Works have not yet been able to put at the disposal of the Ministry the additional rooms asked for   some time ago.       Special representations have, however, been made In the matter to which the First Commissioner of Works   is giving his personal attention
APPENDIX   I.PROCEEDINGS 0? CONFERENCE WITH STATUTORY ADVISEES,SATURDAY 10th MARCH 1917.Present.Car, barnes.1/3% feacnamara.a&quot;. Monster.Mr, Hayes Fisher.Sir, A. Griffith-Boscawen,Attended. Sir Frederick Stopford. Sir Matthew Nathan,Mr. Sanger.;.;r. Bruce.Mr. Wynne,Mr, Wynne stated the general principles on which retired pay was now granted to disabled officers and pen-si one to deceased officers widows, and it was decided in considering the revision of these principles to follow the sequence of a memorandum drawn up by Sir Matthew Nathan.It was decided with regard to Disabled ofj^jiejps 1,     That the distinction between &quot;attributable to&quot; and &quot;aggravated by1&apos; should be done away with for officers as it had been already for men.2t     Dr. Macnamara was strongly in favour of the same retired pay for Captains and Lieutenants.   Mr, Hayes Fisher agreed.   Mr. Forster disagreed on the grounds that this * involved unnecessary expenditure.The following scale preserving the half pay rate In ,!seriouslv affected5&apos; cases, was discussed:-Totally     Seriously   ImpairedDestroyed     affected/ &apos; &apos;     -    ? - c-Captain, Lieut. &amp; 2nd Lieut..     175.     7/- a day 100Major,....................      225       9/-   &apos; 150Meutenant Colonel.0     11/-/    ti    u1753.       It was generally agreed that Article 6 of Army Order No. 3 of 1916 by which a wound gratuity or pension is merged in retired pay on account of disablement should be maintain-ed,
1.0.14,        It was agreed that the present sum of  500 was a sufficient maximum for the gratuity to officers in cases of slight Impairment corresponding to the  200 that has been settled for the men.5.        The &quot;non-attributable&quot; cases on account of &quot;which men can get in special cases  100 gratuity, Dr. Macnamara advocated  300 for officers and.Mr. Hayes Fisher and Mr, Forster considered  200 sufficient,    300 was mentioned by Mr, Barnes as a possible maximum in exceptional cases. 6. (I)     It was agreed that children!s allowances should be given and the following scale was adopted after discussion___Father1s earning capacity._Totally SeriouslyChild. destroyed        affected      Impaired.First Child.Second ChildThird and other children.The children&apos;s allowance was to be given up to the age of 16 and beyond that age under similar conditions to those embodied in the Draft Warrant for men,&apos;Step-children maintained by the officer were to be treated in the same way as other children, but no provision was to be made in the Warrant for the illegitimate children of officers. -Education allowances for officers children were to be maintained but no difference was to be made between girls and boys, the  35 maximum being fixed for both, and only to be allowed in cases where the actual fees amounted to this. Sir Frederick Stopford and Mr. Forster strongly advocated 9 Instead of 13 being taken as the commencing age for education allowance and consideration was promised to thisview,J-                                                                                             -V J.ey25                      20 1520   ;                15 1015                     10 5
402iview.6.  (II)       The allowance for an attendant in the case cf a totally disabled officer was discussed, and it was generally agreed that as an officer was kept at home in cases where men were supported in Institutions, the maximum allowance should be made sufficient for a man-servant. i.d.  78 per year in place of  52 per year provided for the men. 6. (Ill)     It was agreed that the provisions for the treat-ment of officers should be on the same lines as those embodied in Article 6 of the Warrant for m$n, 6. (&quot;IV)       The suggestion that officers might under similar conditions to those in which men are allowed to have alternative pensions, be granted retired pay based on pre-war earnings up to  250, and^on half those earnings between  250 and  500 i.e. up to a maximum of  525 was adopted.    In &quot;seriously affected&quot; cases two-thirds of the amount and in &apos; &quot;impaired&quot; cases half might be given,Mr, Porster advocated prospective earnings being taken into account in the case of subalterns and consi&amp;era-tion was promised to this,7. It was agreed that matters such as the trainingand treatment of officers corresponding to those dealt with in the Draft Warrant for men should be included in the Warrant for officers,8. The question of the relation between retired payon account of service and on account of disablement was left over for future consideration,As regards pensions to the Widows of DeceasedOfficors(1) and (2)    Sir Frederick Stopford suggested different treatment between the widow of an officer who had died at home, from the widow of an officer who had died abroad, and L.;r, Forster wished to keep the distinction between the &quot;highest&quot; and &quot;intermediate&quot; pensions.   Dr. Macnamara andKr, Hayes Fisher were against this and after discussionthe general&apos;opinion was in favour of one scale of pensions,viz:-
403viz:- the highest for1 the widows of officers aether the officers deaths were due to wounds, injuries or disease attributable to or aggravated by military service.The existing intermediate scale would therefore dis-aprear.   The ordinary scale would remain for a husband&apos;s death from ordinary causes on the active list after 10 years service or on the retired list after 20 years&apos; service (subject to means limit),     This neednot appear in the warrant except for reference for retention as it is not a scale in consequence of the present war.(3) It -was agreed that the present highest rates of pen-Si on were sufficient and might be adhered to without change. They are as follows:- 2nd Lieut. Lieut, and Captain 100Major      - 140Lieut-Colonel     - - 180Colonel   - - - 200It was considered that the compassionate allowance for each child should remain at  24.It was also considered that the present gratuity not exceeding 3 years&apos; pay to the widows of officers i?hose death was not attributable to military,service was sufficient, but that a gratuity on account of non-attributable disease or injuries should not be drawn in the first instance by the disabled officer and subsequently if he died by his widow. (4) The education allowance for the children of deceasedofficers should be the same as those to the children of disabled officers.(5) The question for providing for the unmarried wivesand
404and illegitimate children of officers was left over for . further consideration.6.) So also were the alternative pensions to wives ofofficers.
APPENDIX II.405WAR PENSIONS, &amp;c, STATUTORY COMMITTEE.REPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER.For week ending 14th March, 1917,ORGANISATION- BRANCH. Nothing to report.DISABLEMENTS BRANCH.1. The Health Section report that a letter has beenreceived from the National Health Insurance Commission (Scotland) regarding the offer made by the Hairmyrec Colony Committee of accommodation at the Colony for discharged soldiers and sailors suffering from Tuberculosis.The Commissioners are of opinion that the Colony is suitable for this purpose.     It is not provided and maintained under the Commission but it is approved by them and the Local Government Board for the purpose of the Insurance Act.     It was originally intended to receive men who had benefited by institutional treatment and to train them to earn their living in the open air.     A scheme for training in forestry is run in connection with the afforesta-tion scheme at Canpc near Crawford.     The work of building which is only half completed has been stopped owing to lack of labour, but the Government have now placed some German prisoners at the disposal of the Committee,.2* A letter has been received from the National Healthinsurance Commission (Ireland) regarding the provision of--1-
496Hospitalo for Incurables in Ireland.     The Commissioners are of opinion that the number of people suffering from incurable diseases other than tuberculosis is not sufficiently great to justify&apos; the establishment of ouch Hospitals, which are, however, desirable for advanced cases of tuberculosis for purposes of isolation, but a central institution would probably not be popular.     The Commissioners think it undesirable that provision of ouch institutions should be undertaken by any body other than the Commissions or the Local Government Board.TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SECTION.Legal Representation before Advisory Wages Boards.The Training and Employment Section report that the question of Legal Representation of Men before the Advisory Wages Boards has been raied by the Incorporated Law Society through the Ministry of Labour.     We have decided that it is not a practice which should bepe-rmitted, although we have agreed to men being represented by Trade Union Officials and others.Advisory Trade Committees.The Advisory Trade Committees which are being convened by the Ministry of Labour, to decide questions connected with the admission of disabled men to trades or processes of industry found suitable for them, are to be attended by the Officer in Charge of the Section.     We have already received the Report from the Ministry of Labour upon &quot;Attendants at Electricity Sub-Stations&quot;, and other reports-will be issued shortly.-2-

Wrexham Garden Village.The Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust Ltd., have submitted a second scheme, offering the use of a number of completed houses in the Wrexham Garden Village, to be used either as a training or treatment centre for discharged disabled men.     The Section are having full enquiries made into the possible ways of using this offer.-3-

It is a oase in which during Field Exercises a Sergeant in a Cavalry Regiment was killed by the accidental discharge of his own rifle.     The rifle should not have been loaded and pension has been refused on the ground that the accident resulted from the man&apos;s own negligence or deliberate disregard of inotruotions.

The arrangements made by the Ayrshire Local Committee to train disabled men in Gardening, 3ee-keepine and Poultry keeping, and to billet them in the neighbourhood where necessary received the formal approval of the Section.A communication was received from Sir Matthew Nathan stating that the War Office had agreed to the proposals received from the Southend-cn-Sea Local Committee, to train men who are about to be discharged from the Army as medically unfit, while they are still in the Hospital1 s at Southend or are attending as out patients,     It is understood that training will be given at the High School for Boys in Typewriting, Basket Making, Shoemaking and Repairing, Woodcarving. and also by Fhysical Instruction.It was resolved that the Local Committee should be asked to ascertain from the officers-in-charge of Hospitals whether they would be willing to allow men to attend the proposed classes and that if a favourable reply was received, the scheme should be approved without further reference to the Section.The Chairman reported that the Circular requesting Local Committees to submit schemes for the Training and Employment of the Disabled men in their areas, which had been discussed at the meeting of the Section held on February 13th, 1917, had been issued on 6th March.It was reported that a rep^ had not yet been received from the Kent Education Committee to a letter embodying the views which the Beard of Education had expressed with regard to their suggestions for the Training of disabled men.A communication was received from the Wolverhampton Local Committee, suggesting that disabled men should be guaranteed a minimum wage from all sources equal to the standard rate of the trade for which they are being trained., and that such payment should consist of the Fens ion granted by the State, a constribution from the Local Committee and the wages earned.     It was pointed out that as the Training proceeded the earning capacity of the men would increase, and with it the wages paid by the employers.     While the payments made by the Local Committee would gradually decrease.The Chairman drew attention to the fact that under this system men who were undergoing training, would in many cases be in receipt of an income which was considerably larger than any they had had before, and that if for some reason the training ceased the man would be forced to return to an income which was, considerable lower.The Vice Chairman expressed the opinion that while it was most desirable that men should receive every inducement to undergo training, yet the income should increase with the efficiency gained.     He further pointed out that under the new Royal Warrant a man may receive 27/6 per week during his period of training together with extra payment if he is married, at the end of his training he will receive a bonus of &amp;B) per week for every week he has been under training. 5UIt was decided that approval could not be given to&apos; the auggestions made by the Local Committee, whose attention should be drawn to the new scale of payments made under the New Royal Warrant.It was reported that the Oxfordshire Local Committee had suggested that disabled men should be apprenticed to Boot makers and Tailors in Oxfordshire towns and countrjr villages, and that approval had been given to the scheme.It was decided that the Local Committee should be warned that before any training was commenced, they must assurethemselves/,
themselves that the men will be able to obtain sufficient and permanent employment on the completion of their apprenticeship.7. A communication was received from the Southampton LocalCommittee stating that they were satisfied that the proposed periods of training for disabled men at the Hartley University College, Southampton, would be sufficient, and that every endeavour would be made to obtain permanent employment for the men before their training had expirod,It was reported that no reply had been received from the Local Committee as to the attitude of the local Trades Unionists to the scheme; and it was decided to await such a reply and for &apos; the views of the Board of Education on the matter.8. It was reported that the Buckinghamshire Local Committeehad suggested that the disabled men in their area should be trained in Agriculture, Bootmaking, Chairmaking and Motor Driving and that further information had been asked for as to where these subjects are to be naught; the probable period of training, and the fees to be charged for the training in each case,and that a warning had been given that the openings for employment for men trained in motor driving would be extremely small both now and after the war.It was decided to await a reply from the Local Committee upon these points.9. A communication was received from the Pifeshire LocalCommittee with reference to the fees to be charged for training the disabled men in their area in Screw cutting, 3oring and Planing at the Ca^enljeatlfr- training School, Fifeshire, and in Electric Control, Wiring work, and Electrical machinery, and Industrial Recording Mathematics, etc under the Fifeshire Education Committee.It was decided to refer the proposals to the Scotch Education Department, and to ask for their views as to the proposals and the openings for employment which training in the various processes of industry would provide.10. A communication was received from the Leeds Local Committeestating that they could not find a sufficient number of disabled men who were willing to undergo training to justify the formation of special classes, and expressing the opinion that the existing training facilities in the locality should be utilised, and that each discharged soldier should be treated as an individual case and should be trained in the manner which was likely to be most beneficial to him.     It was agreed that under the conditions stated by the Local Committee it would be unwise to form special classes of instruction for disabled men.11. The Vice Chairman reported that he had interviewedrepresentatives of the Walthamstow Local Committee, with reference to their proposals to train men suffering from Neurasthenia in market gardening.     A member of the Local Committee who was a retired market gardener had offered to devote his time to the training of these men, and it was .     intended to employ a competent foreman.     The Board of- Agriculture had expressed their approval of the scheme.It was decided to inform the Local Committee that their suggestions had been approved,4and to request them to furnish a report at the end of six month&quot;s\ as   to the progress made.12.It was reported that Mr. Thomas had been asked to interview the Bristol Local Committee with regard to their proposals to train disabled men at the Royal Blind Asylum Bristol.13/.
A report which had been received from Dr.G&amp;rnete upon the proposals made by the Gloucestershire, Gloucester and Cheltenham Local Committees to train disabled men at the works Messrs. Apperley and Custis.. and Messrs. Lister and Co. was read, and it was decided to inform&quot; the Local Committees that in the opinion of the Section the wages offered were too low.It was reported that Dr. Garnet^ had attended a conference of representatives of Darlington, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham City, Durham County, Easington, Hartlepool, Hartlepool Rural, Sedgefield, Teesdale, Weardale, Thornaby and Middles-borough held at Stockton on February 22nd, and that as the result of this conference it was hoped to formulate a joint scheme for the training and employment of disabled men in the districts represented.A communication was received from the Edinburgh Local Committee stating the Corporation of Edinburgh as the Electric Lighting Undertakers for the city had offered to train and employ suitable discharged soldiers for Switchboard work in Electric Lighting Generating Sections, while theoretical training might be given at the He%Utt-Watt College.It was reported that the scheme had been provisionally approved, and that it had been suggested that the men should be paid directly they were able to do useful work.     The Section expressed agreement with the action taken.A communication was received from the Swindon Local Committee containing prpposals to train disabled men at the Swindon and North Wilts. Technical Institution in Metal Flate Work, Basket Making, Poultry keeping, Mecraiical Drawing and Tracing for the Engineering and Building Trades, Chemical Analysis and Laboratory work, Commercial Work, (Book-keeping, Shorthand, and Typewriting)., Painters and Decorators Work (Lettering, Signwriting, and Lining), Writing, and Illuminat-ing, Jewellery, and Enameling, Wood carving, Poultry Design,. Satined Glass Work, with an average period of training 20 weeks and a maximum period of 26 weeks.It was reported that provisional approval had been given to the schemer, but that the Local Committee had been asked to make arrangements $ thtlocamr mpfLoyersfffcrethenemployment of the men trained, while further information had been asked for as to the proposed training of men in Basket making, and the openings for employment for men trainotf in metal plate work, and that it had been suggested that the assent of the Local Trades Union should be obtained for the permanent employment of men trained In Painting and Decorating, Lettering, sign writing, and lining, and that only men with previous experiemos of classical work should be trained In Shorthand.It was resolved that the Board of Education should be asked to to their views as to the proposed charge of a training fee of 10/- per week per head.A communication was reoeived from the Luton Local Committee with reference to the training and employment of the disabled men in their area.     It was stated that no difficulty had arisen in finding employment for the men, and that any need for training could be met by the local industries of Hat making and engineering, while the Governors of Luton Modern School promised to co-operate in training men suitable for instruction in main technical classes, so that it is not intended tp formulate any definite scheme for Training.     It was further stated that the Local Committee propose to co-operate with the Local Employment Exchange.

20.   A report received upon; the formation of Trade Advisory Committees for a number of Trades.   The Cfriai-rman stated that a -Committee would consist of an equal number of representatives of employed and employees together with a representative of the, Ministry of Labour and the Statutory Committee and that the rhmcrtio-ne of these Committees would be to advise and report upon the facilities for the Training and Employment of Disabled men   in the particular trade concerned.It was decided to request that Mr. Bostock shouldrepresent the Statutory Committee upon these Committees and should report upon the proceedings.21.     A report was received from the Ministry of Labour upon the &quot; \&apos; emplojnnent of Disabled men as Attendants at Electricity Substations and it was decided that a copy of this report should bo forwarded to the Minister of Donsions.22.     The Vice-chairman reported that the Board of Education were about to approach the Treasury with reference to the expenditure, incurred in the Training of disabled men in Technical Institutes. It was agreed that if such training necessitates the formation of extra classes with extra teachers ofc the purchase of extra machinery or machinery the Statutory Committee should be willing to defray the extra cost involved, but that where the classes formed part of the ordinary educational work of the. Institutes then the Disabled men should be regarded as ordinary civilian students and should be charged for as such.   It was decided that the Board of Education should be as$ed where necessary to inspect and report upon any Training which might be given   and on the fees to be charged. The Section expressed its approval of the suggestions.
i23. A communication was received from the London LocalCommittee suggesting that they should he given the power without reference to the Statutory Committee to send disabled men to institutions maintained or aided by the local authorities and to settle the fees to be paid in respect of the training given,It was decided that the Local Committee should be in-formed&apos;,-$hat under the Regulations, the Statutory Committee are unable to give them such powers and that the courses of training and fees proposed must be submitted to them for sanction,24. A communication was received from the Secretary of theEmployment Bureau, Queen MaryTs Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals, Rcehampton suggesting that convalescent Homes should be estab-lished to which men who were about to be discharged from the -* Service should be sent, and where training might be given.It was agreed that the V/ar Office would not be likely to make such provision.25. A communication was received from the Portsmouth LocalCommittee expressing the opinion that training for disabled men could be best supplied in worksb      rather than In technical classes under the Local Education uommittee, and pointing out that the number of men who wish to be trained was small.It was decided to inform the Looal Committee that if satisfactory arrangements could be made for training men in the local workshops they should notify the Statutory Committee for their subsequent sanction, and drawing attention to the induoe-ments to undergo training offered to men under the new royal warrant.26. The Vice-Chairman drew attention to the reports made byCaptain Lane upon his visits to the technical institutes in London, and to the Roehampton Hospital.     It appeared that 332 meij had been trained in the seven institutes visited up to date.27. A discussion took place on the establishment of. Disablements Committee for Scotland and Sir John Cowan was asked, to bring the Question again before the Lord Provosts.28. On the suggestion of the Chairman it was decided tohold meetings of the section once a fortnight instead of monthly as heretofore.J.S. NICHOLSON. m

St. G. HEATH,
10586&apos;1PREFACE.TJii&amp; report is- one of a series which is being drawn up by the Employment Department of the Labour Ministry in collabora-tion with the Statutory War Pensions, &amp;c, Committee. The information is intendent not only for the use of- Local War Pensions Committees, Employment Exchanges, Technical Schools and Institutes, and Military Hospitals, but also for the use of employers and workpeople and any who are interested in the problem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pension Committees are making, enquiries as to the trades and industrial processes in their own area which are especially suitable for disabled men. This series of reports is confined to trades which are to be found in- every part of the country or which cover a much wider area than that of-any Local Committee. The information collected for this report will, of course, need to be supplemented by the more detailed knowledge which Local Committees have already in their posses^ sion or will be able to acquire with regard to- their own local-conditions.Special attention has been given to the problem of training. As is to be expected trade experts have often differed considerably as to the possibility of the trade being learned by adult people and as to the length of training required. In the absence of any previous experience it is impossible to arrive at- scientific knowledge with regard to&apos; this point and the question can onhv in many cases, be settled by actual experiment.The information in these reports has been obtained in some cases through Home Office factory inspectors, in other cases by inspectors of technical schools of the Board of Education, in other cases by officials of the Employment Department, and in&apos; yet other cases by trade associations or persons possessing an&apos; expert knowledge of a particular trade. Each separate report will make mention of the Department Or person who have ren^ dered especial assistance in the enquiry.The information thus collected has been subjected to tho criticism of people with a knowledge of the conditions of the trade, including employers and workpeople who have been good enough to give much valuable time to the revision of the reports.Dealing, as the reports do, with information collected in war^ time, though every care has been taken to ensure that the informa-tioh given is reliable, yet it is inevitable that minor inaccuracies&apos; will be revealed. It is hoped that readers of these reports will assist in the work of revision by sending up any corrections or additions to the General Manager, Ministry of Labour, Employ-&apos; ment Department, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, Westminster, S.W.Advisory Wages Board.These Boards have been set up by the Ministry of Labour in twenty of the principal towns as a provisional experiment. Any Workman or employer in the district can obtain the advice of the Board as to the rate of wages which an individual disabled soldier should be paid for performing certain specified work. The Boards are instructed to have regard to the current rate of wages for similar work in the district and to the capacity of the man whose case they are considering to do such work. They&apos;are not to have regard to any pension to which the man may at the time be-&apos; entitled. For further information apply to the nearest Local War Persions Committee or the nearest Employment Exchange.Placing of Men in Employment.All enquiries with regard&apos;to the employment of disabled men, whether from employers or employees, should be addressed either to the Local War Pensions Committee or the nearest Employment Exchange.
103863   ;[Revised Draft, February 22, 1917.]ATTENDANTS AT ELECTEICITY SUB-STATIONS.Suitability oe Work eor Disabled Men.The work is not suitable for any man who is suffering from a nervous breakdown or who has a weak heart. It could be done by men who have lost one leg so long as they could stand for at least two hours at a stretch. It could also be done by men who have lost the jight of one eye so long as the other eye is normal. Good hearing is essential. It could also be done in some stations by men &quot;who have lost either their right or their left arm so long as they have the full use of their other arm, hand, and fingers. The work is medium to light in character and is carried on in an equable indoor temperature. There is in some cases considerable noise and vibration. Owing to the absence of dust and fumes the work would be suitable for those suffering from lung corn-plaints. The work is comparatively unskilled and could be learnt even by a man who had formerly done unskilled work so long as he was adaptable and quick-witted. A man must be able to keep records and add up figures. While it is desirable that tbe men should be under 35,^men of 40 or even over have, in some cases, learnt the work successfully.In the case of men with only one arm or who are unable to move about rapidly it is desirable that post should be found for them where there is always another man also in attendance in case of accident.Training.In the March of 1916 the Council of the Institution of Eleo trical Engineers, in co-operation with tbe Education Committee of the London County Council and in consultation with the Governing body of the Northampton Polytechnic Institute, appointed a joint committee to make arrangements for classes at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute, Clerkenwell, E.C., for giving a preliminary training to disabled sailors and soldiers as sub-station attendants. The minimum period training at the Northampton Polytechnic has up to the present been three weeks, after which a man &quot;needs a further period of about four weeks under guidance at a sub-station before he should be expected to become at all efficient. The course of training adopted at the Northampton Institute is as follows :  (a) Workshop practice in wiring work and the use of simpletools.(b) Power-house demonstrations to familiarise the studentswith switching-gear aud running machinery.(c) Electrical and physical laboratory work of a simplenature.(d) Class  demonstrations  in   the  elements  of   electricalengineering and simple engineering physics.(e) The writing of ,reports upon the demonstration andlaboratory work.. (/) A brief viva voce examination at the end of the course.Any previous experience in connection with electrical work or with simple engineering, such as the use of tools, is helpful to a man.The work might be learnt entirely at a sub-station, but the advantage of preliminary training at a technical school is that it shortens the probationary period required in the actual sub-station, and enables a man more readily to adapt himself to different types of sub-stations.The number of men who have been admitted by the Selection Committee to the course at the Northampton Polytechnic since its commencement in June, 1916, up till February is 111, while the number of men placed has been 78. Of the 33 men not; placed, some had to give up owing to ill-health, others were offered posts in other trades during the period of training, while :a few failed to pass the examination.
10586 -1A course has also been started by the Newcastle-on-Tyne Elec-tric Supply Company, Limited,&quot; at the Company&apos;s School at Carville Power Station, Wallsend-on-Tyne. The preliminary, theoretical, and practical training is given by the company itself in a course which lasts for six weeks. Thirty-six men started the first course, of these 26 finished the course and were placed at work within the company&apos;s own sub-stations. There is every indication that the men thus placed will prove satisfactory. Three gave up the course, while the remaining seven were found unfit for the particular work, and were placed elsewhere with the company.Further courses are about to be started at Manchester and Leeds, while the matter is under consideration in other towns.Prospects of Permanent Work.The work is too responsible to be entrusted to young persons, while women are not allowed in peace times owing to the fact that the work is done alternately night and day, and there is a considerable disinclination to employ women even in war time for this reason, though they have been employed at a*few places. -&apos;? Up to the present time there have been more than twice as many applications from employers for men as there have been men available after training. Difficulties have arisen owing to the geographical distribution of the vacancies not always coinciding with the home ties and obligations of the men trained. Although some of the men placed have only taken the place of men upon active service there is a good prospect of permanent work for all suitable men as there is likely to be an increase in the number of sub-stations after the war, especially if the generation of elec-trical power, as seems likely, is carried out on a larger scale and becomes more centralised.From reports received from employers the men hitherto trained have proved themselves in every way suitable for the work. The only difficulty has been the disinclination of certain men to remain at the work owing to the fear of losing the whole or part, of&apos; their pension, but it is hoped that this difficulty will be speedily . met by forthcoming legislation.Maintenance during Training/Under Regulation 12a, Part II., of the &quot;War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee disabled men can receive 25s. per week with 2s. Qd. a week for each child, or if this is higher the amount of a man&apos;s earnings immediately prior to his training so long as the training is given under a scheme sanctioned by the Statutory Committee.At Newcastle the company pays the man 25.5. a week during training irrespective of their pensions.Wages.In pre-war times in country districts the commencing wages paid have been as little as 23s. a week, but the average has been nearer 305. The minimum commencing wage in war-time, including war bonus, has been 33s. for men trained at the Northampton Polytechnic, and the average has been about 35.9. a week. When fully qualified the men receive the full trade rate of the district in which the sub-station is situated. At Newcastle the men receive 305. a week plus a war bonus of 85. Gd. with the prospect of increases after one and two years&apos; service..Hours.The usual hours are eight hours per day for seven days a week, with a Sunday off every two or three weeks. The work is carried on, as a rule, in two or three shifts, thus involving on an aver-age an eight-hour night shift every third week.The Employment Department of the. Ministry of Labour is especially indebted to the Institutions of Electrical Engineers and the Northampton Polytechnic Institute for their assistance in the preparation of this pamphlet.
tAPPENDIX-  VIZ[FOR OFFICIAL USE  ONLY.]ARMY COUNCIL INSTRUCTION,No. 449 Of 1917.War Office,13th March, 1917.449. The Continued Treatment  and the Training of Dis-eharged Soldiers.1. Local War Pensions, &amp;c, Committees have now been very generally established, and it is important that Officers i/c Hospitals should be placed in relation with these Committees in a manner to be presently described.2. With reference to A.C.I. 1912 of 1916, it must be borne in mind that so long as in-patient treatment is required, whether by means of curative manual exercises or by other means, and aeeom-modation is available, soldiers will be retained in the appropriate hospitals.3. On the termination of such treatment, if the men are considered to be unfit for further service, they will be brought before an Invaliding Board, but will not be discharged from hospital until the date of their actual discharge from, the service i.e., 21 days after their discharge has been approved by the Invaliding Board.4. When a soldier has been approved for invaliding from the Army, and when he is subsequently discharged from hospital, some further treatment as an out-patient may be necessary. Such out-patient treat-ment may often be afforded at a military hospital, and whenever a Local Committee presents such cases for treatment this should be afforded for as long a period as may be required. For many of these cases also an appropriate system of technical training may be desirable. The provision of the means for such training rests with the War Pensions Statutory Committee in London, but information bearing upon such matters should be placed at the disposal of the Local Committee concerned, and Officers i/c Hospitals should assist with advice or in any way that lies within their power.5. In order that Local Committees may be able to make themselves fully acquainted with the needs of men whom it is proposed to invalid, the fullest facilities will be given to duly accredited representatives of these Committees to visit and confer with the hospital authorities and the men concerned.6. As soon as the soldier has been approved for invaliding from the Army, the Officer i/c the Hospital will forward to the Secretary of the Local Committee of the district in which the man proposes to reside a card (A.F. W. 3555), giving full particulars with regard to the man, his disability and of the treatment recommended for him..b 12718-115)   4000   3/17   H &amp; S   A. 17/115
This card will be sent by the Local Committee receiving it to the Officer, i/c the Hospital in which the. man is. to receive out-patient treatment, who will return it to the Committee with a note on it when the treatment is completed. A copy- of the card given to the man at the time of his discharge will remain in his possession.7. It will be necessary to give the widest possible publicity to the facilities thus to be afforded to discharged soldiers, and to this end a poster has been issued by the War Pensions Statutory Com-mittee, copies of which should be displayed in a prominent position in each ward and in any other convenient and conspicuous position in the hospital.The lists of Local Committees therein referred to will be supplied by the War Pensions Statutory Committee, 22, Abingdon Street, S.W.8. An initial distribution of; the posters, and cards, referred to in this. Instruction will be made as soon as supplies are available to all Central Hospitals, and further, supplies of the latter should be demanded in the usual manner. Further copies of the.poster will be supplied on application to the War. Pensions Statutory Committee.9. The D.D.M.S. of the Command will, furnish to the Statutory. Committee and to the. Local Committee lists of the military hospitals which will serve the various districts, concerned; also a list of Special Hospitals in the Command, stating the nature of the special treat-ment afforded in each.10. The details connected with the attendance of men for further treatment will be arranged locally, by Officers i/c Hospitals in consultation with the Secretaries-of-the Local Committees.*24/Gen.

424,,r APPENDIX VIIIMEMORANDUM - by the&apos;National Health insurance Joint Committee as to proposed amendments to the National Insurance (Part I Amendment&apos;    Act, 1915.Note.The proposals set forth below are subject to modification after discussion with the Ministry of Pensions. 1. Section 1 (1) of the Act of 1915 provides that areduction of 5/- a week shall be made in the rate of sickness or disablement benefit payable to a man In receipt of &quot;a pension in respect of total disablement suffered in consequence of the present War,&quot;     This provision is clearly based on the assumption that a man who is in receipt of such a pension is, in fact, wholly unable to work by reason of his War disablement.     Such a provision Is consistent with the terms of the Royal Warrant hitherto In force, which provided a specific rate of pension for cases of actual total disablement.     The position will, however, be fundamentally different under the new Royal Warrant, under which a new scale of pensions is set up with a maximum and various lower rates, but which does not retain the criterion of degree of incapacity for work.     Definite mutilations or wounds or degrees of physical impairment will, under the new Warrant, govern the pensions granted. 2. As under the. new Royal Warrant there would be no rate ofpension for total disablement, it would appear that Section 1 (1) of the Act of 1915 becomes inoperative.     But even if this were corrected as a matter of wording, under the new arrangements men in receipt of the full &quot;100 per cent&quot; pensions (27/6d a week) will in many cases return to employment and resume the payment of contributions under the National Insurance Acts, and in such circumstances, they ought not to be deprived of the sickness and disablement benefits which would, pro tanto, indemnify them against loss of earnings when incapacitated for work,3.
423. It is considered that Section 1 of the Act of 1915should be amended to meet both the above points.     In the first place the reference to &quot;total disablement&quot; should be eliminated and the reduction of 5s. should be attached to the receipt of a maximum pension under the new scale of an &quot;alternative pension&quot; amounting to 27s.5d. a week or more.     Secondly, the reduction of sickness benefit should continue only until the man returned to employment and. has actually been employed for 26 weeks and 26 contributions have been paid.     The weeks of employment need not for this purpose be consecutive.     Similarly, the disentitlement to disablement benefit should be removed when the man has actually been employed for 104 weeks and 104 contributions have been paid. These v/eeks also need not be consecutive. 4. In some cases where a gratuity is awarded underArticle 7 (1) of the new Warrant, the man will,*in fact, be for a time totally incapable of work, and it is understood that the gratuity, in such cases, practically replaces a temporary pension at the maximum rate, but that a lump sum is paid as it is thought that in this way the man will be encouraged to return to work at the earliest possible date.     The Joint Committee consider that the reduction of the rate of sickness or disablement benefit should apply to cases of this kind, but they are of opinion that the full waiting period of 26 weeks of employment before the removal of the reduction of rates should not necessarily be required in all such cases.     It is therefore proposed that in cases of this kind, the reduction of sickness benefit should cease to have effect after a varying number of weeks of employment (not exceeding 26) to be stated in each case at the time of the award of the gratuity, the period being fixed by the Minister of Pensions in relation to the amount of the gratuity.
5. It is not considered that the proposal made, in thepreceding paragraph should apply in the case of men who receive gratuities under Article 7 (2) of the ne?/ Royal Warrant. 6, The provisions of Section 1 (2) of the 1915 Act,under which, pending the settlement of a manfs claim for pension, benefit is payable at the full rate, (the excess payment being recoverable in certain ways in the event of the retrospective award of a total disablement pension), have in practice given rise to considerable difficulties.     It is, therefore, proposed that In any case where, in accordance with Article 8 (1) of the new Royal Warrant, a temporary allowance of 14s, a week Is granted pending the decision as to the award of a pension, the man should be treated for the purposes of the Act (as amended) as though he were in receipt of a maximum pension, and that his rate of sickness or disablement benefit should be reduced accordingly, but that if, on the decision of his case, a pension at a lower rate than 27s.Sd. a week should be awarded, the balance of benefit withheld by reason of the reduction, should become payable to him.
