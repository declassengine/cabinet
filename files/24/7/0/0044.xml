fiEGRET. Copy Ho..WAR QA37.TU?TG.T.144RECORD OF IMPORTS 01 GOVERELiFlT ACCOUNT.. ,   - (Memo by Sir H.Babington Smith)The records of Imports which are published in the Monthly &quot;and Annual Trade Returns are compiled by the Board of Customs from particulars of Quantity and value which the importer is required to furnish before * clearance within 14 days after the arrival of the ship.Imports which ai^the time of importation are the property of E.M.Government or of the Governments of the Allies are not included in these returns,  and the only records of.them are such as are kept by the Departments concerned for their own purposes.     There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Imports of food for Government account (meat, wheat, sugar) are included in the Customs Returns, and in other cases Government imports may be included because the ownership is not known to be other than private.    The result is that it is difficult to say whether any particular head of imports includes any Government imports or not, or to know what portion of the total represents Govern-ment imports.The principal importing Departments are.-War OfficeMinistry of Munitions AdmiraltyOffice of Works (timber, now transferred to .War Office)Air BoardBoard of Trade  (meat) Sugar Commission Wheat Co-miss ion.The records of the imports made by these and other departments are not at present compiled or brought together in any way.   We consider it important that there should be a record of these imports in such a form that complete information may be avail-able as to the whole      the imports into the United Kingdom,This record should be compiled by the Board of Customs, in the (same manner as the General Trade Returns.     For this purpose it would only be necessary that each department should within a specified period furnish to the Customs particulars of quantity and, if practicable, of-value for each consignment received,     It would not be necessary for the ship to carry documents showing particulars of Government cargo.The Board of Customs should arrange with the Departments concerned the manner in which the particulars should be furnished,, and the precautions necessary for avoiding dupli-cation.We do not think that this work could be conveniently undertaken by the Tonnage Priority Committee.    That Committee deals with goods -which it is proposed to ship.   The Returns should deal with goods which have actually arrived.      The Committee has no staff or machinery in existence-for the work.
The Customs Staff which deals with -the General Trade Beturns, could, with very small additions, deal with this work also. Suitable machinery exists for deciding Questions of classifi-cation.   We &quot;believe that the Eeturns would he of the greatest use to the Tonnage Priority C omit tee.5, The question of the inclusion of certain kinds of Govern-merit imports in the General Trade Eeturns should he considered afresh &quot;by the Board of Trade and the Board of Customs, and definite rules should &quot;be adopted.   The object should be to include all articles imported by the Government in the General Trade Eeturns, unless there are special reasons for their exclusion.   A list of articles to he excluded should be prepared by the Departments specially concerned.We think it desirable that no articles should be excluded from the general Eeturis except where secrecy is of real im-portance and can only be obtained in this way.     Secrecy may, for iiistance, often be secured by the inclusion of items under some general headings as well as by exclusion.    Thus explosives might be described as &quot;general chemicals,&quot;The figures relating to the articles thus excluded would not be published, but would be compiled separately by the Customs and would be available for Government use.6. A similar question arises as regards C-ovdrnment exportsand we recommend that a similar procedure should be followed. Exports to Prance, or other theatres of war for the use of British Forces of all kinds, need not be included in the Returns,&apos; but &quot;exports for foreign governments and for governments of Dominions or Colonies should be included.?. If the above recommendations are approved, it will benecessary that instructions should be given to all Departments to furnish the necessary particulars to the Board of Customs.)Sgd)     H.BABI!?GTO!&apos;T SMITH.
