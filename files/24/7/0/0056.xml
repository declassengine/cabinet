(3u Jru^tCopy ffo.SECRE fWAR CABINETExemption from Military Service of Surveyors and Assistant Surveyors of the Board of Inland Revenue.(1) Note by Mr.Bonar Law, dated-13th March,1917(II) Memorandum by the   Board of Inland Revenue, dated 12th March, 1917.I.te by Mr. Bonar Law.-I circulate to my colleagues a statement by $he Board of Inland Revenue showing why in their opinion 122 Surveyors and Assistant Surveyors in their employment should not be called up for military service under the recent decision of the War Cabinet that all men passed fit for general service and under the age of 23 should be at once released.     Their case in common with tbat of other employees unffer the Re^jnue Boards has been heard, by the Director of National Service whose&apos;decision by the ruling of the Cabinet is in these cases final, subject to appeal to the   War Cabinet.     I am content to abide by his decision in all cases except this and after going very carefully into the matter, I am firmly convinced that the withdrawal of these men would gravely prejudice the efficiency of the tax surveying staff and in consequence, our prospect of maintaining the progressive yield of Income Tax and Excess Profits   Duty upon which 1 have to rely for ihe bulk of the national revenue.     As our credit, or in other words, our continued capacity to borrow during the War both in this country and more especially, in America depends ultimate-ly upon the maintenance of our tax revenue and our ability to increase that revenue as our debt gro?/s.     I cannot but view with the gravest apprehensions any measures that in my opinion will result in diminishing its yield.13th March. 1917(Intld.) A.B.L.II.Memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue.12th March, 1917National War Revenue .t Surveyors of   Taxes&quot; and the Army.1.        The parties to this issue are two branches cf the State -not the War Office and a private concern which could hardly be expected to be disinterested.2.        The issue itself is twofold(a) whether the vast revenue for which the In&amp;i&amp;nd Revenue are responsible   is a national necessity,, and
o(b) whether the 122 men in question are a necessary element in securing that revenue.3.        The Board, of Iniand Revenie hold that the answer to both (a) and (b) &apos;.;is in the affirmative.As regards (a) -The yield of In^nd Revenue taxes (which in 1916-17 ending 31st March 1917 may well reach  385,000,000) is in itself a substantial contribution towards- the War bill,     ^he mainten-ance - and indeed the increase - next year of this yield is equally important for that purpose:   and the Department, if only allowed a chance, might hope to raise&quot;In the financial year 1917-18 between  400,000,000 and  500.000,000BIn addition, the fact - and knowledge - that there is a safe national income is   ( end must be) the basis of Govern-ment credit, l,e, it is a condition precedent to the Government being able to borrow, that prospective lenders should feel sure of their interest and of redemption arrangements.Unlike both enemies and allies the British Government has pursued the path of solvency, for it has kept taxation more than abreast of the amount of its recurring commitments due to the Yfer (e.g, pensions   lor-r. interest.t loan redemption):   and any failure tc naintft; ... tn:. ; stanor -\ would be in&apos;&apos;-c?.preto-j. in enemy and neutral countries as evidence of financial decadence on our part.4.        Consideration of the national needs in the matter of finance naturally lies outride the province of the War Office; but the importance of finance is so obvious that it must be assumed that the War Office case In the present instance rests on their unwillingness to accept the opinion of the Board of Inland Revenue that the 122 men in question are a necessary element in securing the revenue which is required,5.        As regards the general financial situation, the Board of Inland Revenue are bound to proceed on the assumption that the action of a Government In imposing taxation precludes any discussion or controversy on the part of its Officers (Civil and Military alike) as to the necessity for that taxation.     The Board further assume that taxation which is imposed is intended to be secured - and this of course depends on the maintenance of an efficient machine.6.        The Inland Revenue Department may roughly be said to consist of (a) a large central staff located at Somerset House, Edinburgh and Dublin and (b) a Land Valuation Branch with about 100 local&apos;offices, and   (c) a Tax Surveying Branch scattered over the whole country in between 600 and 700 District Offices already in existence out of 800 re quired7.        The Budgets of the past few years (notably those of 1907, 1909-10., 1914 pre-war   1915, and 1916) have involved an expansion of this Departmr1   amounting in effect to the Creationof a large new Depar :.nont.. and the increase in the volume of the work has been accompanied by the introduction of numerous further complexities into duties already of a highly technical character.     (It may be mentioned that the receipt of the duties under our management in 1908-9 was  62 millions, in1913-14 was  88 millions, while fcr the current year we anti-cipate a receipt of about  385,000.000.)
8f       Notwithstanding these facts, we have released (so far as fit for general military service) all Second Division Clerks under 26 years of age, all Assistant Clerks under 31, all permanent Valuation officials under 01 (any temporary Valuation officials being left entirely to the discretion of the Military Tribunals),&quot;and practically the whole mechanical staff up to 41.This disposes of categories (a) and (b) in paragraph 6 above.9.        How We come to category (c) i,e. the Tax Surveying Branch.,    On the efficiency of this Branch depends about 90$ of the&quot; Inland Revenue.10. ,     The authorised establishment of this Branch consists of(&amp;) Inspectors tad. &quot;i: veyors of Taxes numbering 1,P25 and(2) Clerks numbering 4,000 (  including an addition cf 400 for which we have been compelled to ask.)11.      Owing to the continuous expansion of the Department due to recent Budgets - see paragraph 7 above - the average age of the staff is at the present time abnormally young.12.      With regard to the Tax Clerks the extent to which this staff is depleted is evidenced by the fact that we have available only some 6b0 men with upwards of two years experience (including men unfit for general military service).The number of temporary Women Clerks is already 1700 and this number is being daily increased y.rherever possible.These facts have to be mentioned on account of their very serious import in regard to the Surveyors of Taxes, the difficulty of whose position is dealt with in succeeding paragraphs.13.      This brings use to the subject matter of the present appeal, viz: Surveyors of TaxesrThese officers are the mainstay of our revenue.The principle of their organisation is decentralisation and&quot; not centralisation - the   United Kingdom is divided into many hundreds of Districts, each District is committed to the c &amp;3*g&apos;  of a Surveyor v;&quot;- , ib v .ovided with an office and C rical Staff end represents the   Crown in all matters relating to Inland Revenue in his area.It is on the vigilance, energy and skill of the individual Surveyor that the Department has to rely for the productiveness of the Income Tax and the Excess ProfitsDuty ..
Duty - taxes which are as&quot; intricate^ In their character cc they are unparallelled in their yield,14,      The position of Surveyors of Taxes in relation to the needs of the State at the present time may be sumroatf iiK&amp;A thus :- :(l) these officers are responsible for 90$ of the Inland Revenue taxes - i&amp; 1916-17 (say)&quot;for S  346,000,000 and in 1917-18 (say - probably) for   410,000,000 plus any additional taxation which may be imposed byt the forthcoming Budget.(2) the revenue significance of these Officers is of course emphasised by any diminution in the Customs and Excise revenue which must follow upon the restrictions on consumption (liquor and imported articles) recently foreshadowed,(3) the equipment of the Branch as a whole for its task has already been seriously affected by military requirements,    . via: by the depletion of the experienced-Clerical Staff pro-vided for the Surveyors1 offices (see paragraph 12 above).(4) the staff of Surveoyrs is even now 80 short of its complement, owing partly to vacancies and partly to military service,(5) owing to the concentration into the last few years of so many sweeping changes and the consequential expansion of the Surveyors, amounting almost to the creation of a new Department (see paragraph 7), the average length of training is dangerously low - a facx which obviously makes it, not easier, but much more difficult to withdraw men from a branch of the public service where amateur substitutes1 are perfectly useless.(:6)&apos;the burden upon the Surveyors has been almost unbear-able and, if the strain upon them is not merely to continue but actually to be aggravated by the irreplaceable loss of a considerable proportion of their colleagues, the psychological effect upon the tired men who are left and who are already doing their uttermost can only be such as to react detrimentally upon the revenue.What then is the &quot;gain&quot; to the State if the Army acquire 100 mon at such a cost?yIt sho&amp;pl &quot;be remembered that a Surveyor of Taxes has to apply a most complex code of Statute law (as interpreted by innumerable judicial decisions) to the ascertainment of profits arising from every form of commercial, industrial, agricultural and profession-al activity.    .Ee needs to be, in addition, proficient in account-6ncy and, as part of his daily business, he has to be able to hold his own against individual taxpayers and their professional representatives in private discussion, and, when necessary, in open Court cn appeal before the local Commissioners of Taxes.$the- above figures are exclusive of Death Duties and Stamp Duties for which Surveyors of Taxes are not responsible.
(Sgd.) E,E, NOTT-BOWERWAREEH-lflSHBR15.       The War Office -argument for the withdrawal from Revenue work of the 122 Surveyors of Taxes in question amounts on analysis to this - that.it is impossible to maintain that any man under 23 years of age is really required for the purposes of the national revenueeIn other words, the War Office ignore the fact that a man who has entered the Public Service by an examination at least equivalent to the Woolwich examination and who has had some years training in highly technical work may well be an asset of great value - all the&quot;greater if there is a shortage of trained men to cope with a vast expansion of work.The &quot;/ar Office criticism can be put to a very simple test.     In the Army, Gunners and Sappers are regarded as specialised corps.     Yet - under. War conditions when the demand has far outstripped supply - the Military Authorities have had to use officers of a few months- experience for the. artillery etc.. whereas in peace times a course of some years would have been considered imperative.16.       In conclusion the Board of Inland Revenue g;*.feel it incumbent upon them to place on record their conviction that the withdrawal of the 122 Surveyors, of Taxes   in question from Revenue work can only be seriously detrimental to the national revenue and that the demand cf the Military Authorities for their withdrawal is founded upon a misconception of the real interests of the State.
