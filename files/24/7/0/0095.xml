0YdJ 1 .G.T, - 195OJl 0.1311132.POTiTOPll FOP TPS iOLDLetter -from Socrtrbarj/ of Stato for Par to&quot; Secretary of liar CePDinelTT&quot;17tli I larch 1917,My dear Sir Maurice,I spoke to the Prino Minister 70storday with reference to tho decision of tho liar Cabinet on the sub-joot of potatoes to bo deductod for civil consumption from tho so which havo boon bought and roeiiisitioned for tho troops by tho Array Canteen Committee, and havo asked for reconsideration of the cuostion,I would point out that not only was I not present when this particular item was discussed, but I was distinctly told that it would not conio on, and, indood, tho Prime Minister told mo himself that ho had no idoa that It was coming on.Tho result was that Colonel G:-ordon L-eith was the only member present to speak&apos;on bohalf 6f tho liar Offico, and although ho put his case,&apos; I bolievo, very clearly, it was obvious that ho was not in a position to attempt to onforee his views&apos;in the way that I, or more senior members of the liar Office, would do.     In consofuonco I do hot think that tho Par Cabinot fully appreciated tho position.Tho soldier is rationed by a ration in&quot;kind, together with a ration In cash, amounting to 5wd, per man per&apos;day,Tho ration in kind consists of meat, bread, bacon, toa, oto., and tho whole of the balance of the-man1s daily ration has to be. bought out of this 5-J-&amp;. through the Canteen, It is therefore the duty of the . Irmy Canteen Commit toe to sup-ply suitable articles of foodstuff upon which this sum of 5-g-d, per day por man can bo spent.At tho recuost of tho Pood Controller a largo number of standard articles of diet, such as ewtra ham and bacon, bread, rabbits, sugar, etc,, have boon alroady eliminated from the list of articles en which this 5-wd, can bo spent,T/hen the Par Cabinet, therefore, ordered tho soldier to have &apos;6no potatoeless day a week and loss potatoes on tho other sin, they were again seriously curtailing the standard articles upon which this 5-yd, is generally and properly spent, and that I am sure they would not wish to do.The Army Canteen Committee, with great foresight, bought - when nocessary using thoir r oquisitioninw powers -sufficient potatoes to supply the men with a curtailed allowance till the newt potato crop is lifted, but oven then&apos; they are somewhat short of the amount that would bo required, having in view only 29,000 tens instead of 36,000*tons that would bo required to give tho present full ration.     This comparatively small deficiency would have been met by tho Issue of othor vegetables; but now we are calloc, upon to release 10,000 out of the 29,000 tons for the benefit cfScotland
Scotland,,     If this order is&quot;carried out&apos;it means only 19,000 tons loft to the Army,- whereas 36,000 tons arc required.     This reduction will involve, when allowance is &quot;made for losses owing, to the recent frost,&quot; a maximum amount to the troops of i-lh0 per man per day, which will practically involve every alternate day Doing a potatoolcss day for the Army, which goes far beyond tho allowancg proposed by the War Cabinet5 as any increase- on the x-lb, per man per day would involve further&apos;purchases or recjui-sitions by the Army Canteen Committoe0\/e are informed by tho Treasury Solicitor, wh.6 is the person to \ohom wo have to refer for legal advice, that it is not legal for us to&apos;use an Army rocuiisition to supply tho civil population, and tho War Cabinet1 s decision, if it stands, calls upon mo to do at tho same time an illegal act and a great injustice to the soldier0I am afraid the point that was urged that Scotland had denuded itself of potatoes in order to find soed potatoe cannot, from an Army point of view.&quot;bo looked upon as a very happy argument for giving up tho 10.000 tons, as I may point out that wo had mado arrangements to plough up as much Army5 and other land, as wo possibly could in order to grow potatoes this summer,&apos;having received an assurance from tho Board of Agriculture - confirmed in writing - that they woul provide us as far as possible with the necessary sac do   We therefore made no effort to purchase such seed, relying cn the Board of Agriculture to fulfil their promisen   Mb arc now informed by that Department that of the 1,500 tens of sood potatoes which wo wore promised and urgently require, thoy can only supply us with 100 tons0tI have reason to bolievc that tho statement made by Colonel Cordon Doith at the meeting, that the amount of potatoes controlled by tho Army Canteen Committee&quot;is only a small&quot;percentage of the amounts still available, is correctoI hopo the matter may be reconsidered next week when, if owing to absence in Paris I am unable myself to bo present,  tho Quartermaster General can attend and state his viewso     Till then I propose-not tc put into execution the War Cabinetxs decision, which I respectfully say I think was arrived at without the full facts of being properly understood.Yours sincerely, (Signed)       DERBYo
