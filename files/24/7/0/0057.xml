ftAK C0HI1ITTEE.USE Off aZP^QSIYa^r^g aO.:x;rg HOSTIIB AH&amp;jIIPG -Memorandum by nord Ourson, Chairman of the Air Board,dated 7th July, 1915.2he*a.ir Board, at its sixteenth Meeting, on the 4th July,, 1916, considered the ruestion which had been raised by ILajor G-en, von Donop at the -for Committee and referred by that Committee to&quot;the Air Board, of the advisability of adopting, and, if do, under -That con-&quot; ditions, the Pomeroy bullet for use against&apos; Zeppelins. The Pomeroy bullet is. a hollow-nosed bullet, containing a charge of dynamite, which explodes on impact.The Board had before them a Ilenorandum, of which copy is annexed, by ilarjor Gen. von Donop, who also attended the Meeting of the Board,The Doard considered the following aspects of the question: -(1)   &quot;whether the tests of this bullet established its officacy.(2)   &quot;Whether we are precluded from using It by theConventions to which this country is a party.(3)   If not, ought its use to be confined to re-si sting attacks of Zeppelins in this country?(4)   May we use- a bullet against a balloon or air-ship v/hich we are precluded from using against human beings?(5) In using such a bullet against a balloon or air-ship wo  ire not incidentally using it against the crew of tho balloon?(5) Assuming that it is possible to uso the hullot in this country only, is there a risk of it being&apos;taken over to Prance by members of the(7)   If the bullets were so taken over and discovered there by the enemy, would the probable result be that the enemy would adopt measures of retaliation?Prom the information furnished to the Board, it appeared; so far as the results of tests can be relied upon, that the Pomeroy bullet has pr6ved very effective. It has bee3i tried on dummy Serrielins, about 50&apos;. of which were set on fire, but no doubt, until tried under actual service conditions, complete assurance of its efficacy cannot be obtained.As regards the terns of the 3 Conventions ruoted in Con. von Donop1 s Memorandum, it will be observed that whereas the Hague Convention of 1907 only forbids the use 9? projectiles calculated to cause unnecessary suffering, the Convention of 1858 specifically prohibits the employ-meat of projectile which Is either explosive or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances, which by the Convention of .1899 the contracting parties renounce the use of bullets which expand or flatten easily in.the numan body.
Although, it can hardly be rjaintained that the Con-vention of.1907 supersedes the two earlier Conventions quoted, yet it nay reasonably be advanced that the spirit and intention of those earlier Conventions were the&apos; prevention of unnecessary suffering to human beings.   It may bo argued tnat the conditions of warfare existing in 1060 and 1899 were such that the employment&apos;of an or-plosive bullet, ezneept against human beings, did not enter into oho nines of the framers of those Conventions, further, the ar-miment mav be adduced that in the course of this war the C-erviians have violated all 5 Conventions above referred to, thereby leaving us free&quot;to do the same. Even as regards this specific violation, i.e. by the use of inflammable and explosive bullets, it must be remembered that the ,:..ustrians were found, in 1915, to be using an explosive bullet and that reversed bullets have been dis-coverecl in the pouches of German soldiers.If it is &quot;further considered that the use of the 1-omeroy bullet as suggested Is to be exclusively restricted to defence  gainst .Geppelins, which are them-selves, in their operations, infringing recognised customs of war by dropping bombs on open towns and non-combatants, it will appear that there are substantial grounds for nain-taining that the use of this bullet for the purpose named is justifiable,    &apos;x&apos;he fact that the crew of a Zeppelin aro liable to be hit by bullets aimed at the&quot;Zeppelin itself does not appear material to the argumenta     ouch a case would be an accident analogous to that of a soldier gassed by the&apos; fumes of a Lyddite shell.The Board wero assure:. by the ifcval and Liilitary ilenibers that adequate steps could be taken to secure that the regulation that such bullets&quot;Were not to be taken abroad would be strictly adhered to.   In those circumstances it appears probable that the enemy may remain indefinitely in ignorance of our uso or the bullet.In the light of the above considerations, I am pre-pared to recommend to the V/ar Committee ihet the use Of this bullet within this country and against ;;;o&apos;:nelins, but not otherwise,  ihould be permitted.-(gigned)   gv2z011 0?

SECBET.BOTlTOlT, EXPLOSIVE BULLETS ?Q&apos;R USE AGAINST AI30R,&apos;g?T, (Submitted to the Air Board by Major-General von Donop),In November 1915 the Army Council had before them a question of the use of,incendiary&apos;bullets,The II. .0* stated as followsi-&quot;Before! the war I had no hesitation in saying that these in-&apos; &quot;ccndiary bullets infringed the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, &quot;see end of these notes).     I am doubtful if they infringe the 1907 &quot;Convention as I an not sure that their uso Is calculated to&quot;cause &quot;unnecessary suffering but D,G.AiM.S. could speak as to this.   The &quot;situation has, however, changed.   Belligerents on both sides are &quot;using poisonous gas and the Germans have used liquid fire, both &quot;of which to my mind infringe the Conventions concerning Laws and &quot;Customs.   Austrians have without doubt used explosive bullets, &quot;while the Germans have used inverted .bullets which have the &quot;same effect as the so-called diuii-dum. . In these circumstances &quot;I see no reason&apos;why we should not employ incendiary bullets for &quot;war in aircraft, always renei-ibering that we run the risk of the &quot;Germans murdering our officers if found with them.&quot;The matter was considered at the 55th Meeting of the War Committee on the 25th November, 1915, when it was decided that &quot;the Admiralty and the War Office are authorised to employ incend-&quot;iary and explosive bullets against aircraft.&quot;It i3 not known why the explosive bullets were included in this decision but it is believed it was in view of the fact that the Germans wore using their Seppelihs by bombing defenceless towns and killing women and children. -Early in June tho Minister of Munitions informed the Army y Council that a demand had been received frdm the Director of Air-craft Equipment for some Austrian t^rpe of .303 inch explosive bullets.   Mi&apos;. Ll03?d George pointed out that he understood that when it was discovered that the Austrians wore employing this type of bullet against the Serbians a strong protest was made in Neutral countries by the Allies while a considerable amount of notice was given in the British Press to this infringement of International Convention, and Llr. Lloyd George asked for the views of the Amy Council as to whether the manufacture of this bullet should proceed.Om reference being made to the 3.P.C.- Intimation was given that it was&quot; necessary to proceed with the development of tho Austrian bullet as certain developments had been made in the fomeroy bullet which; for attack of airships^ was considered considerably superior. The Pomeroy bullet&quot;is a hollow-nose&apos; bullet, i,e. dum-dum (filled with dynamite).   ...As this, in addition to containing dynamite was a hollow nose bullet, which the British Government have set their faces against for years, the Army Council considered that it was only right to bring to the notice of the War Committee what their decision at the 55th Meeting involved.
. The principal International Declarations dealing with this subject are &quot;briefly as follows:-(1).   The&quot;International Declaration of St. Petersburg, 1868, included the following:-&quot;The contracting parties engage mutually&quot;to renounce, in case of war among themselves, the employment by their military or naval troops of any projectile of a weight below 400 grammes which is either explosive or charged with ful-minating or inflammable substances.&quot;(2).   The International Declaration of the Ea0ue, 189.9:-&quot;The contracting parties agree to abstain from the uso of bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body, such as bullets with a hard envelope which does not&quot;entirely cover the core or is pierced with incisions.&quot;(3).   The International Convention of the Hague, 1907:-&quot;It is particularly&quot;forbidden to employ arms, pro-jectiles or material, calculated to cause unneces-sary suffering.&quot;The C.O.C., .A0yal Flying Corps, has stated that the reason he wishes to use these bullets against aircraft is that he thinks they are the best means by which asDoplanes can disable Zeppelins and he thinks that as he only intends to use them in England against  epyelins, there is no danger&quot;of our men being found by the enemy provided with these bullets.   It is also claimed that re are justified in using bullets prohibited by the Hague Conventions against an enemy who drops bombs on un-. protected towns and kills women and children.There is a (Le.nseT that if our aircraft officers areprovided with these bullets in England, they may take themover to Prance and there possibly may be found by the enemy in possession of thorn,Oera^leo   of the bullets mentioned will be produced at the meeting on the 4th instant.2 Whitehall Gardens; 5; 17. 8th July, 1916.

The &quot;Jar Committee approved the recommendations in the Ilemorandum by tho Chairman of the ,.&apos;..ir Board (Appendix I) that the use of tho Pomeroy explosive bullet should be. permitted within this country and against Zeppelins, but not otherwise, thus confirming the pro-visional approval- given by the Prime Minister on the 13th July.Use oflosive Bullets inst Hostilo shins.
