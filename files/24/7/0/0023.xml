I em directed by the Minister of Munitions to enclose 12 copies of a Memorandum prepared in this Department with regard to the question of supplies of jtew&apos;Materials and particularly metals required for the production of Munitions of War.     Shis memorandum points out the serious necessity of the exercise of all possible economy in the use of these materials, and gives some indication of the measures and methods of control which have been adopted in this Country for the purpose of securing this economy. At the same time, it invitee the attention of the Allied Governments to the vitel importance of their talcing similar measures and instituting similar control,     I am accordingly to request you to cause this Memorandum to be eommunieated to the representatives of the respective Allied Governments at the earliest possible ;.oment.   I am to Bay that the Minister desires to express the earnest hope that the Allied Governments may see their way to take steps, without delay, to carry out the policy indicated in the memorandum.It will be within the recollection of the International Commie ion that a circular with regard to economy in the use of aluminium has already been oommunioeted through them to the Allied Governments, aM I am to add that a copy of this Circular has also been communicated to Monsieur 2homas*Copies of the Orders referred to in the final paragraphof the memorandum are aleo enclosed, and copies of this letterand of the memorandum ere being communicated to the ForeignOffice and the Inter-Allied Munitions Bureau.i have the honour to be.

109SECRET.Memorandum respecting the Supply of Raw Materials, and particularly of Metals, required for the Production of Munitions of War.&apos; - It is becoming increasingly apparent that the &quot;world&apos;s supply of -the principal metals is now being taxed to the utmost, in order to carry out the programmes developed by the different belligerents. In these circumstances the requirements of those programmes can only be met by the rigid restriction of the use of metals for purposes not directly connected with the conduct of the war. H.M. Government have for some time definitely regulated their policy in the light of these considerations, and have imposed upon the United Kingdom, and also upon the British Empire generally, many restrictions of an irksome character. Particular reference may conveniently be made to some of these restrictions :-.(1) Tin Plates. No permits are now issued for the use of tin plates for food packing, or other commercial purposes in the United Kingdom.   The result has been to put an end to the greater part of the British export trade in foodstuffs and semi-fluid commodities. (2) Constructional $ eel.-No building work costing more than 500L can be carried out in the United Kingdom except with the licence of the Minister of Munitions, and no steel at all of the best qualities is permitted to be supplied for building purposes.   Further, no permits are now issued for corrugated sheeting, and consequently buildings required for urgent war work are now being constructed of brick, wood and slate, or, where steel work is essential, of steel of inferior quality. (3) Copper, and Brass. The use of copper, brass and copper alloys for all purposes is rigidly: restricted, and accurate returns are required of all brass and copper scrap which is produced by consumers, to whom permits for supplies of metals have been granted.   Permits for the supply of copper . are only issued for purposes directly connected with the conduct of the war,&quot; and all ordinary commercial uses of the metal have now entirely ceased.H.M. Government have undertaken arduous responsibilities in connection with the supply of metals and articles manufactured from metals to the Allied Governments. They have been glad that it has been in their power to assist the Allies, both by allotting to them a part of the output of metals in the United Kingdom, and by arranging for the purchase of additional supplies in the United States of America and elsewhere.In connection with the applications which they have received, for the supply of articles to the Allies they have been driven to the conclusion that not nearly so severe a control and limitation of the use of the essential metals has been established in any of the Allied countries, as that which is now in force in the United Kingdom. They find it impossible to justify a state of affairs under which they are supplying to Allied Governments, for use ultimately in ordinary commerce, materials which are denied to British industry except for purely war purposes. They therefore beg to urge most strongly upon the Governments of all the Allied Powers the importance of imposing at once, and rigidly enforcing, restrictions upon the use of the metals in question. In particular they would draw attention to the importance of the following points :  (1) Steel. Only steel of shell discard quality should be allowed to be used forconstructional purposes. (2) Copper and Brass.-Copper and brass should not be allowed to be used for any purposes whatsoever except such as are necessary for the prosecution of the war. The greatest economy in the use of these metals for such purposes should be exercised and every care taken to use up all the scrap produced in manufacture. In particular these materials should be used with the most rigid economy in the construction of vessels of war and merchant shipping. (3) Tin Plates. The requirements of each country for tin plates- should be carefully investigated and tabulated for a period of at least six months in advance. Without the information which such returns would furnish, HM. Government fear that it may beQgme quite impossible for them to satisfy, even in part, the requirements, of Allied countries for this material.(4) Aluminium. The manufacture has been stopped of any article from aluminium or aluminium scrap and swarf in this country with very few exceptions.a   (33)2523   Pkll2   250   3/17   K&amp;S &apos;
2       -. 2The releases of this metal this year for non-war work will amount to (only a few tons, and &quot;then only for such essentials as telephone work and machinery for edible oil refining and milking. -.. (5) Spelter.  &quot; Commercial zinc&quot;  and refined  zinc are essentials   in the manufacture of many classes of munitions. Owing to the abnormal demand and the entire cessation of the Belgian output, the supplies available are only just,sufficient, after exercising the greatest care, to meet our needs. The Government for some considerable time have been adopting drastic measures to prevent waste and the use ofv,this metal for civil or non-.: essential purposes.   For instance, they have stopped practically the whole, of the galvanizing or coating of sheet-iron and steel with zinc both for -home use and export, and have insisted &quot;that the sheet shall, if necessary, be protected from rust by paint or other cheap method only.   All domestic . articles made of brass (which contains zinc) are being ruthlessly cut down, and substitutes provided made of common cast-iron.   The manufacture of&apos; zinc sheets and zinc nails, except for very special purposes, is prohibited, and the output even of zinc paints and other similar products containing .zinc has been curtailed to the lowest possible point.   Now that these methods of conservation of the metal are being rigorously carried into effect, an astonishing saving in consumption is being secured.   Spelter of good ordinary brand (G.O.B.) -should be utilised in preference to refined spelter for the making of brass for all purposes except cartridge cases.(6) Lead.- The use of lead is entirely prohibited except for munition purposes, the only exception to this rule being urgent and necessary sanitary repairs. As an instance, even for such works as repairs to lead roofs, asphalt is .    substituted.(7) Nickel. No nickel is used in this country for any purposes except cupro-nickel strip for small arms ammunition,-nickel steel and other essential . munition purposes. (8) Platinum is absolutely under control and is allowed, apart from munition purposes, only for essentials such as medical work and dentistry.   Its use is absolutely prohibited in jewellery and other non-essential trades. . . (9) Magnesite. As the supplies of magnesite are imported from Greece, Italy, and India, economy of time and transport will be effected by manufacture of the bricks in France and Italy In preference to importing magnesite bricks from Great Britain. ;(r10.) Gas Retort Carbon. -The export from Great Britain is prohibited in order to conserve the material for the manufacture of carbons for electric search lights.H.M. Government would draw the attention of the Governments of all the^ Allied Powers to the fact that such metals as copper, lead, spelter, aluminium to mention only some of the principal metals have to be purchased mainly in. neutral countries, and it seems essential to them that, in order to avoid the exploitation of the needs of the Allies by producers and others in such neutral countries, some co-ordinated system of purchases should be arranged. Before, however, any system can be made effective, it is, in their opinion, necessary that each of the Allied Governments should impose on their subjects the same restrictions that have been enforced in this country in regard to copper and other metals. Under these restrictions, negotiation ior, or purchase of, any of these metals, whether in this country or abroad, is forbidden except under licence from the Ministry of Munitions.Copies of orders which have been made by the Minister of Munitions in this country, restricting the employment of various metals, are annexed to this communi-cation,* and it is suggested that the policy expressed in these orders should receive the most careful consideration by the Allied Governments, with a view to the adoption of the. main principles upon which it rests.Ministry of Munitions of Wak.March 1, 1917..    -     * List of Orders referred to above. &quot;^^i-^f^ff ov:.20l1916^&apos; Copper Scrap,and Swarf-(Jan. 1, 1917).Aluminium audits Alloys (dec. 2, 1916). - Steel Mods, Bans and Wire (feb. 2, 1917).Copper, wrought and unwrought (dee. 8, Brass Swarf and Scrap (feb. 24, 1917).
