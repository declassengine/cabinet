WMl CmMHET:,Report on negotiations as to payment by Results by Minister of Labour.As the result;of the Meeting at the Central Hall addressed by the Prime Minister on February 6th. the Government1s scheme for introducing payment by results in shipbuilding ysrds was considered by the Executive Council of the Federation of Engineering&quot;and Shipbuilding Trades et their Quarterly Conference at Newcastle on February 23rd.The Resolution proposed by the A.3.E. was finally adopted in the following terms.:-&quot;In reply to the suggestionsmade by the Minister of Labour for the adoption of systems of payment by results, and Circular 212 of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, the Executive Council make the following statement:-&quot;(1) That the only method we can approve for dealing with the question of payment by results is by Local Conference in the first instance with the Local association of Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the Trades Unions concerned, in accordance with the provisions of the York memorandum.&quot;(2) Wherever payment by results is by this method introduced during the wcr period, the introduction shall be treated as a departure from trade union custom, and a record of each departure kept in accordance with the Munitions Act, and a guarantee shall be given&apos; for the restoration of time work conditions after the war.&quot;Further, my Executive Council in reply to the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades&apos;  circular 212, desire-to notify that body that in our opinion they ere not entitled to legislate for the Trade Unions affiliated to the Federation on the question.of payment by results, and to notify that body that the position of the A.S.E. has already been forwarded by communication to the Minister of Labour.&quot;An amendment stating that&apos;the Societies concerned would object to any introduction of payment by results was defeated by a 3-crge majority.On the other hand, a second Resolution was subsequently passed recommending the various Societies which objected to payment by results to get together with a view to common action.     These Resolutions were conveyed to the Ministry of Labour on the 28th-.of February, and on March 2nd. a conference was held between the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Munitions, and the Controller of Shipyard Labour ox the Admiralty, to consider what would be the best method of introducing payment by results in shop3 where time rates at present prevail,&apos;There was some difference of opinion ea to whether the first resolution passed by the Executive Council was intended to concede the principle of payment by results or not, but it was agreed that.the procedure that should be adopted was to ivseume that the Unions as a whole were prepared to acquiesceSjJBE T.

in the Government1 s decision, and to circularise the Ire ions and the Employers&apos; Associations forthwi th with a view to putting the naahinery ol local Conferences in --notion with.a view to the discnoaion of the method of payment by results to be adopted. Circular letters have accordingly been drafted, of which copies are attached, and which it is intended to send out forthwith.It cannot be ejected that the universal intro-duction of payment by results will be rapidly achieved.     Hot onl is there considerable opposition to the change in principle among certain of the Unions, who will no doubt seise every opportunity for delaying its introduction, but if, as may be expected, the majority choose to adopt a system of piece rates if ther than premium bonus, e considerable time must inevitabljr elapse before piece rates for each kind of work in each shop have been agreed upon between the psrties.     The fixing 01 piece rates is at all times a difficult and lengthy process and, &quot;although a consider-able improvement in the output should be effected by the substitution of s premium bonus system for time rates in some trades and districts, a consi&amp;ereble time is likely to elapse before the change in method of payment which the Government have decided upon has been universally effected throughout the shipyards.As the Shipwrights (Mr Wilkie. Secretary) and the Boiler Makers (Mr.John Mill) had accepted the principle of. payment by results previous to the general decision, we anticipat quicker results from them than from any of the other Unions, and as these two trades are responsible for the hulls of the vessels, any.delays in the arrangement with the engineers and other trades for payment by results will not retard work to any serious extent.J.

Treasury, 221-2.182MINISTRY OF LABOUR,Montagu House,Whitehall,LONDON, S.W. 10th March, 1917,Sir,I have to inform you that, in view of the urgent necessity lor new tonnage in vrew of the attacks on shipping hy the German Submarinesy the (Government decided that It was necessary to introduce payment by results in the Shipbuilding industry in cases where time rates at present prevail.     With a view to securing the concurrence of the Trado Unions con-cerned, the j?rime Minister addressed a full meeting of dele-gates from the Federation of Engineering and ShiiDbuildlng trades on February 6th last,&quot;at which he explained the need for tfc.3 change, and put &quot;forward the proposals of the Government, of which a copy -is enclosed.f After further consultation with the Unions,  I have addressed a circular letter to the Executive Councils of all the Unions concerned asking them to communicate the Governmentrs proposals to their District Committees in order that they may be prepared to discuss the matter with the local 3mployers! associations with a view to introducing a system of payment by results for the period of the war with the least possible delay.The procedure proposed will be as follows.     In the first instance local Conferences will be held between the Local  escalations&apos; of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers1 Federations and the Trade Unions concerned, but in view of the &apos;:teat urgency of the matter tho Government do not consider that it will be possible to hold any b^t local conferences.     TheseSecretary,
Local Conferences will be for the purpose of settling the questions:-fa) whether an uniform method of payment by.ro-sults should be adopted by districts for trades where time rates now prevail, or whether in any trade or trades the question should be settled in each shop in-dividually or in particular groups of shops;(b) whether in the event of it being decided that a uniform method should be adopted for the District, what that method should be.In the event of no Local Conference being held within10 days of tho putting forward of proposals in regard tothe adoption of a System of payment by results, or of noagreement being reached in regard thereto at the LocalConference within 7 days of the Workmen1s proposals beingput forward - the matter may be referred to the localTribunal hereafter mentioned for decision at the instanceorof either party/of the Ministry of Labour.     Any decision given hy a Local Tribunal on a difference affecting the whole District will be made binding on non-IFe crated firms.Whenthese preliminary questions have been settled by the Local Conferences,  or in the absence of agreement, by the Local Tribunal, Committees consisting of representa-tives of the smployers and the employed ohould be set up for each trade in each distxict to drav,&apos; up a schedule of rates and prices for the trade of that District, and if for any trade no&apos; District System of Payment by Rosult has beon agreed or oletermined upon by the Conference or tho Local Tribunal, a Shoe Committee of that trade should be set up in each shoo to settle the method of payment hy result to bo adoptee- in the said shop ::nd the rates and prioes in connection therewith.
The local Tribunal, which will be set up in each district, will consist of on independent Chairman appointed by the -Ministry of ;abour, with two  Pechnical Advisers for each trade, one of whom will be appointed by the employers and the other by the workmen in the district.    They will hear any cases in which agreement has not been reached, but in the case of a difference relating to rates in particular work, it will, be a condition that neither of the Technical Advisers shall be in the employment of or connected with the Works in question.    If either side fails to appoint Advisers -within seven days of being re-quested to do so by the liinistry of labour, they will be appointed by the Ilinistry.The Tribunals will sit locally, and it is hoped that by this means a rapid hearing Till be secured for all cases that arise.    In order to avoid delay, however, it will be necessary for both the Employers and the Unions concerned to select beforehand suitable representatives who will be prepared to act as Advisers in cases afiecting the various Trades in which differences ,s to rates and method of working may arise.The Government have agree-., that v-h iever: payment by results, in substitute for  oayment by time is introduced during the v.ar period as a result of these Conferences, the introduction shall be treated -.s a departure from Trade Union cueton, raid&apos; the record of each departure kept in accordance with the provisions of Schedule li (6) of the Munitions of &apos;. ar lot, 1915, and that the Guarantee con-tained in the Treasury Agreement for the restoration of Trade Union customs waived during the ! ar period shall ap-:ly in all cases where payment by results has been so. introduced instead of time rates.The Government have further declared, as vi-il  *e seen-from paragraph 5 of the attached . Memorandum,  that
any mutual agreement or award in favour of substituting a system cf payment by results for payment by time in a trade now paid on time shall include the provision that the existing time rates should be doemed to constitute a guaranteed rate for all time worked, should this be dee? sired by the Workmenrs representatives.I have therefore to request that you will take immeliate steps to frame proposals for payment by results in aocordanco with Paragraph 1. of the attached memorandum and place it in the hands of the duly accre itod represents-tives of the Union or Unions afrected, with a view to its discussion at a Local Conference, and I am sure that I can rely on your Association doing their utmost to assist in carrying out the above proposals with as little friction and difficulty as possible.The local Officials of the Ministry of Munitions and of the Director of Shipyard^Labour of the admiralty will be pro,pared to lend every assistance in their power and I need hardly say that the Ministry of Labour will at all times be ready to offer advice on any points on which it may be re-quired, and to consider the best means of overcoming any difficultios &quot;that may ariso.I am, Sir,Your wbedient Servant,
Memorandum on the Governmentls proposals for substituting payment by results for time rates in the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades communicated to the Trade Unions eon-cerned by the Minister of Labour.As the Government have determined that it is in the national interests tmt a system o,f payment by results should be established, the following are the suggestions of the Minister of laicur for methods to be adopted.1,      The employer j where payment on time rate is in operation, shall, in writing, place in the hands of the Shop Steward, delegate, or other duly accredited representative of the Trade Union or Unions affected a copy of proposals for pay-meat by results.2t      Any counter proposals of the workmen should also be given in writing to the employer or his duly accredited representative within seven days from the receipt of the employerTs proposal or proposals.3.      In the event of no decision being arrived at within a further seven days, the matter must be submitted to an Arbitration Tribunal consisting of a Chairman appointed by the Ministry of Labour with two technical advisors one of whom shall be appointed by the employer and the other by the workmens neither ef whom shall be in the employment of or be connected with the particular works involved.     In the event of either side failing to appoint such technical advisers, then the Minister of Labour will make such appointments.     The Award shall be an award under Part I of the Munitions of \7ar Aot 1915 ard shall be final and binding upon both parties.4.      Where any trade can arrange a national s ystsm ot payment by results direct with the employers, an Arbitration Tribunal will be set up similarly constituted as in paragraph 3. for the purpose of dealing with any complaint upon which no agreement can be arrived at, and the decision of the Tribunal shall be final and binding upon both parties *5.      It is hereby declared and understood that no mutual agreement or award in favour of payment &quot;by results shall prevent the existing time rates from being deemed to constitute a minimum wage.
