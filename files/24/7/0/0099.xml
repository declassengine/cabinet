FThis Document is the Property .of His Britannic Majestfs government, jPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1917.SECRET. ,;    i*ya T No 1QQNOTE ON THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES OF MAN-POWER, BOTH WHITE AND COLOURED, IN THE OVERSEAS DOMINIONS AND DEPENDENCIES OF THE EMPIRE.1. IN considering the attached Tables (I. to IV.) comparing the man-power figures of the four Overseas Dominions with those of the United Kingdom, the different economic conditions of the several Dominions must be kept in mind. Many of the staple industries (e.g., gold mining in South Africa, lumber trade in Canada, &amp;c.) do not lend themselves readily to the substitution of female labour. On the other hand, little munition work is being done in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, and even in Canada a much smaller percentage of the population is engaged on this work than is the case in the Mother Country. Other factors differentiating between the Dominions and Colonies are the varying proportions of alien elements in the populations. Thus in Canada we have important communities of American, Scandinavian, Russian, &amp;c, birth, scarcely amenable to voluntary recruiting agencies.Moreover, large and varying numbers from the several Dominions and Colonies have proceeded at their own expense to the United Kingdom to enlist, and only estimates of these can be given.2. South Africa. The number of additional men to be expected from South Africa is not great, in view of the fact that no large proportion of those of Dutch extraction is likely to enlist voluntarily for service in Europe. It has already been suggested to the Union Government, however, that the South African Contingent serving in France, which at present consists of one infantry brigade, five siege batteries and certain auxiliary units, should be expanded to a division, and efforts to this end are being made. The latest information is to the effect that recruiting with a view to the formation of a second infantry brigade, and a proportion of the divisional troops (Engineers and Medical units) will be undertaken from 1st January. It is hoped that the recent decision to grant Union rates of pay to all South African troops serving in Europe will have a beneficial effect on recruiting.3. Australia,.-There still remains a large reserve of man-power in Australia.In May last the Commonwealth Government held out hopes of a sixth Australian division being raised, but were not sanguine of being able to maintain it in the field. The result of the referendum on compulsory service, however, has not only falsified those hopes, but has led the Government to question the feasibility of maintaining the five existing divisions in the field. The reinforcements required to maintain the five Australian Divisons in France and the Mounted Brigades in Egypt for 12 months amounts to approximately 140,000 in the aggregate. A sixth division, with 12 months&apos; reserves behind it, would require approximately 44,000 additional Category &quot; A &quot; men. From the figures given in Table II. it appears that it should be feasible to raise a sixth division and maintain adequate reserves for all six divisions and the Mounted Division in Egypt.4. New Zealand. From the figures in Table II. it appears that New Zealand should have some 76,000 men of military age and physically fit still available. After allowing for 12 months reserves for the New Zealand Contingent already at the front there should[412] B
2be at least 30,000 left for disposal. This number would suffice to raise a second division with five months reserves behind it. It may be argued that the raising of a division with less than 12 months reserves to support it is not justifiable, but in view of the fact that several mouths must necessarily elapse before the additional units to form the second division could be formed and transported to Europe, and that there is every likelihood that by that time the climax of the war must be imminent, if, indeed, it shall not have been reached in the meantime, it will be far more to our advantage, after making due provision for reinforcements for the forces already in the field, to raise additional fighting units than to build up further reinforcements for an indefinite period.   At the worst these units could subsequently be used as reinforcements.5. Canada. -In regard to Canada, the figures in Table II. speak for them-selves. The late Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, was most anxious to form two additional divisions from existing reserves, so that they could take their place in France before the spring of 1917. He was confident that adequate reserves for all six divisions would be forthcoming, but just as he was about to put his plan into execution the recent political crisis occurred in Canada and his resignation was the result.At the present time the infantry of a 5th Canadian Division has been formed in brigades at Witley and steps are being taken to form the necessary divisional troops, with the exception of artillery, but the Canadian Minister in London (Sir G. Perley) is doubtful as to the wisdom of regarding it as anything more than a draft-finding formation. Artillery for it can be provided in France by the release of the regular artillery at present with the 4th Canadian Division, which will be replaced during the current month by the despatch of the 4th Canadian Divisional Artillery from England.The question has recently been further complicated by demands for railway con-struction, personnel and lumbermen from the Canadian Reserves both in England and in Canada, but in view of the large reserve of man-power still available for combatant purposes, it appears that it should be practicable to raise sufficient additional reserves to justify the despatch of the 5th Division to France as soon as its training is sufficiently advanced, and even the formation of a 6th Division when the 5th has embarked.6. Newfoundland. Newfoundland, in addition to furnishing two battalions and a reserve battalion, has many men serving in the Imperial Navy, and has increased her own naval reserve from 482 to about 1,200.7. India (Table VI). As regards the Dominions and Dependencies which furnish coloured populations, it will be seen that the general percentage of the male population actually serving as compared with the estimated number of Category &quot;A&quot; men of the tribes from which recruits are obtained is very low. The figures in Table VI. are based on the returns of the 1st January, 1915) but since that date about 69,000 recruits surplus to wastage have been enlisted.The Government of India have also agreed recently to raise 16 new infantry battalions. At the present time the war establishment of an Indian infantry battalion is less than that of a, - British infantry battalion. If the war establish-ment of the former were raised to the British establishment, it would give an aggregate increase of 19,000 men in the Indian battalions serving outside India, including the 16 now in process of formation. This increase would not necessitate the addition of any British officers, which is the main difficulty in raising new Indian regiments. It appears that there should be no difficulty in obtaining these recruits if the suggestions of the Viceroy of India as to general betterment of the conditions of service in the Army be sanctioned.   This question has been taken up with the India Office.As regards the white population in India, there are 44,000 efficient volunteers. The Government of India now proposes to embody permanently sufficient of these with a view to relieving six British battalions for service outside India, and to organize, equip and train the remainder sufficiently to meet any sudden emergency. Up to the 30th June, 1916, the Indian Army reserve of officers had been increased from 40 to 1,923. These officers were nearly all formerly in the volunteers but are now either on field service or under training in India.8. Egypt and the Soudan. As regards coloured population in Africa generally, statistics are of little practical value. In many countries the estimate of the population is mainly guess-work and, in any case, certain tribes only are suitable for military service as either combatants or non-combatants.In Egypt and the Soudan nothing has yet been done, and, in the latter country, serious difficulties to raising additional troops have presented themselves. The Sirdar has offered to release three existing and fully trained Soudanese or Arab battalions for
3service in Egypt, to be replaced by three newly conscripted Egyptian battalions as soon as the latter can be raised. It is estimated that this would take about six months. The Sirdar has also stated that it might be possible, by offering increased induce-ments, to enlist voluntarily a brigade of four battalions of Arab and Soudanese troops. Owing, however, to the fact that existing Soudanese units are at present much under establishment, and that there is great difficulty in obtaining recruits, this scheme is open to so many financial and administrative objections that the Sirdar is of opinion that only great urgency would justify its being put into operation.As regards Egypt proper, under the terms of the Proclamation of 5th November, 1914, declaring a Protectorate over Egypt, Egyptian troops cannot be employed in the actual defence of Egypt against the Turks. It is doubtful if the material available would, in any case, be fit to place in the front line, but it is thought that the formation of labour battalions raised by conscription for service both in and outside Egypt would not be contrary to the terms of the proclamation. Local labour corps (presumably raised voluntarily) have for some time been employed on the Canal defences with success.   The question of raising such units in Egypt has been taken up.9. East Africa, Uganda and Nyasaland. In accordance with instructions issued in March last and subsequently to General Smuts, and with arrangements made with the Colonial Office, the Kings African Rifles are in process of expansion to four regiments of three battalions each and a fifth regiment with a special establishment for service on the Northern Frontier. Of these, six battalions of the four regiments and a mounted infantry company are in the field, five more are in process of formation, some of which are well advanced, and the formation of the fifth regiment is being proceeded with. The recruits are obtained from Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese Mozambique, British East Africa, Uganda, German East Africa, Somaliland, surrendered German Askaris and.a few Abyssinians. It is probable that some tribes of doubtful fighting value have been drawn upon. An application to recruit in Belgian territory was vigorously refused by the Belgian Government, and although the Portuguese Government declined to allow British recruiting parties in their territory, recruits are obtained through the Portuguese Administration.Arms and equipment are being provided and the new units will probably be mainly required in East Africa.No further action seems possible at present, but on completion of the campaign in East Africa, when the whole of the enemy territory has been occupied, it should be practicable to obtain a further supply of recruits.10. South Africa. From South Africa two coloured (combatant) battalions are now in East Africa, as well as numerous details (e.g., transport drivers). A Cape coloured labour corps (1,000 strong) and a native labour corps (10,000 strong) have been formed and are now either in or en route to France. So that no time may be lost in the event of a favourable report on their utility, the Union Government has been requested (18th December) to undertake the preliminary arrangements for the supply of further labour contingents.The Union Government were requested to take up the question of forming combatant units from such races as the Zulus, but are definitely opposed to any action in this direction.Recruiting of Basutos for munition work in England and for the South African Labour Corps was found to be impracticable.A proposal to replace Army Service Corps drivers in France by Cape boys has been taken up.11. Rhodesia. From Northern Rhodesia a battalion of native police is serving in East Africa. As the new King&apos;s African Rifles battalions will recruit in Northern Rhodesia, it is expected that all further available men will be absorbed thereby. An infantry battalion formed from the white population was offered to the Union Government in 1914, and took part in the suppression of the rebellion, and in the campaign in German South-West Africa.   It was then disbanded.A second battalion was raised, placed at the disposal of the Imperial Government, and has since been employed in German East Africa. It has been heavily drawn upon for officers of the new Kings African Rifles units and for special services, and is now (January, 1917) reduced to the strength of a company.From Southern Rhodesia a (white) police battalion is serving in East Africa, and -a native police battalion was rapidly raised from the Matabele, and is also serving in
4East Africa. The white population of Rhodesia is depleted, and much difficulty would be experienced in finding competent officers and non-commissioned officers for any additional native forces.12. West Africa. A battery and a battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment, West Africa Frontier Force are now in East Africa with a small number of Gold Coast Volunteers. A Nigerian Overseas Contingent, consisting of one battery, four battalions, .signal section, machine-gun company, and a small medical establishment, formed from the Nigeria Regiment West Africa Frontier Force has recently arrived in East Africa. Steps are being taken to raise a carrier corps (4,000 strong) in Sierre Leone for service with the overseas contingent in East Africa.Kroomen and carriers for inland water transport in Mesopotamia are being enlisted ; the latest reports show that 400 men have already been obtained in Sierra Leone. Further reports are awaited. It is hoped that the Gambia Company, West Africa Frontier Force, will shortly proceed to East Africa.A special organization to deal with upkeep of the overseas force and recruiting for internal security in Nigeria is well in hand, and a similar organization for the Gold Coast is under consideration. In addition to and independently of this, Colonel Hay wood, R.A., has been appointed Assistant-Director of Recruiting and has now reached the West Coast, charged with the duty of visiting the West African colonies and protectorates and undertaking such recruiting as may be possible. His reports are awaited before further steps are taken. Nigeria has, however, already been drained to safety point to provide the overseas contingent. A special attempt is being made, to send 2,000 recruits as reinforcements, but it seems doubtful if they will be obtained within six months. Specially qualified officers with Nigerian experience have had to be recalled from France and other theatres of war in seriously large numbers to provide officers for the contingent and to form recruiting parties.Ptecruiting on the Gold Coast is by no means easy, and the greatest difficulty is at present being experienced in finding suitable material for reinforcements for the overseas contingent.13. Other dependencies (Tables VII, VIII. and IX.) Gibraltar. The civil population are technically camp followers and are not suitable for military service.A local Volunteer force exists and a certain number of civilians are serving with the Royal Garrison Artillery in subordinate positions to replace trained men sent home for service elsewhere.Malta. A Labour Battalion (1,000 strong) is now at Salonika. The Royal Malta Artillery and two infantry battalions form part of the garrison of Malta.Cyprus. Muleteers are being recruited for service at Salonika and it is hoped to obtain 3,000 of them.Hong Kong, Ceylon, Mauritius, Seychelles. All available white males have already volunteered. Hong Kong and Ceylon are undertaking local defence, so releasing the Indian infantry battalions. As regards black and coloured populations in Ceylon and Mauritius, it would be impossible to form fighting units of any value, owing to the tribes not belonging to fighting classes and to the difficulty of furnishing suitable officers. It would seem that they would best be used as labour units or employed as munition workers.The Government of Hong Kong proposes to raise some troops for combatant purposes as soon as the question of raising labour forces in China is settled.In the Seychelles a carrier corps is being formed for service in East Africa and some 600 have recently arrived there.West Indies, Bermuda, Honduras and British Guiana. A British West Indies Contingent has been formed, absorbing only a small proportion of the coloured population. They have not been well reported on by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, as first line troop , but have done satisfactorily as ammunition carriers and among the personnel of heavy batteries in France. Steps are being taken to raise further battalions for these purposes and as line of communication troops.14. Recommendations. In regard to th-* forces of the self-governing Dominions, the Army Council make the following recommendations : (i.) That the Commonwealth Government be urged to take steps at once for the formation of a sixth Australian division.
5(ii.) That the Government of New Zealand be urged to undertake at once the formation of a second New Zealand division.jllf (iii.) That the Government of Canada be urged to agree to send the fifth division to France as soon as it can be completed to establishment, less its artillery, and when its training is sufficiently advanced, and further to examine the possibility of raising a sixth division.&apos; Bo&apos;f\ Should it subsequently be found in the case of any of the above that sufficient reinforcements are not forthcoming to maintain an increased number of divisions in the field the new formations can be used to provide drafts ; or, as an alternative, the infantry of divisions can be reduced to nine battalions. x15. The Council further recommend that instructions be issued to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt to take immediate steps to raise three new Egyptian battalions, with a view to releasing three fully trained Soudanese or Arab battalions for service in Egypt, so that the latter can be placed at Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s disposal not later than the 1st August next.In view of the Sirdar&apos;s statement that there is great difficulty in maintaining the existing Soudanese battalions at all under present conditions, and also of the additional garrisons rendered necessary by the recent acquisition of territory, the Council are of opinion that the whole question of voluntary enlistment in the Soudan should be examined with a view to ascertaining whether it could not be stimulated by the offer of increased inducements. Should this prove to be the case, the Council recommend that a brigade of four Arab or Soudanese battalions be formed for employment in Egypt.K H.

In such a case the 25 per cent. &quot;A&quot; men estimate will naturally be far short of the actual figure, looking to the fact that recruits under this heading are all ob-obtained from a source which is practically wholly composed of selected lives.Notes. 1. Figures for Great Britain show that the proportion of men aged from 18 to 41, both inclusive, who are fit to be placed in Category &quot; A,&quot; is about 25 per cent, of the total male population, while the number of men of the same age fit for other military services is approximately 15 per cent. These percentages have been used as a basis for above.2. No account has been taken of Imperial Reservists called to the regular army. These may be reckoned approximately as 5,000 each for South Africa and Canada, and less for Australia and New Zealand.3. Above estimates are probably on low side for following reasons : (a.) The age distribution in the Dominions may be expected to differ considerably from that of the Mother Country. There will be proportionately a greater number of men in the prime of life in the Dominions.(o.) A very considerable portion of the population in the Dominions is composed of emigrants from Great Britain, who are for the most part of very good physical fitness, e.g., in the case of some of the Dominions men suffering from diseases such as tuberculosis, &amp;c, are not permitted to land.
