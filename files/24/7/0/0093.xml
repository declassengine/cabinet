G.T.-1Q5PROVISIONAL AGENDA FOR THE IMPERIAL -AR CABINET,The Imperial War Cabinet has been summoned to discuss the War, and matters arising out of the War.     Subjects not directly connected with the War will, therefore, as far as possible, be excluded from the discussions.The subjects to be raised are primarily those which con-pern the British Empire, whose representatives have met in conclave for the purpose.fe are more concerned to forecast and to provide for the future than to describe or discuss the past - -historical dis-quisitions should, therefore, as far as possible, be avoided.I Broadly speaking the proceedings of the Imperial WarCabinet will fall under four headings:-(a) Statements or memoranda by leading British Ministers / for the information of the Members, to be. followedby questions or discussion on their part..   It may be found desirable that some of these statements should be circulated in advance, Instead of being read at the meetings.(b) Increased Imperial Effort for the continuance of the War.(c) Terms of Peace.(d) Post-War conditions.III Concurrently with the Imperial War Cabinet the Imperial War Conference will be sitting at the Colonial Office.    Care has be en taken not to encumber the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet with matter that.will more properly fall to be discussed by the Conference.   Eor instance, the Economic, Commercial and Fiscal conditions after the War, that ought to be aimed at by the British Empire as a whole, will belong to the Conference rather than the Cabinet.     Similarly, if any Questions concerning the future constitution of the Empire are- raised, it is the Confer-ence rather than the Cabinet that should discuss them.     The same may be said of measures for demobilisation, land settle-rue nt &amp;o.,IV The majority of the departmental papers or memoranda ordered for the use of the Imperial War Cabinet are now in a forward state of preparation and will be circulated in due course before the particular discussions to which they refer take place.The Imperial War Cabinet will doubtless find it eonven-ient to refer particular matters that can be more properly or effectively dealt with by a smaller body to Committees, much in the same way as is done in the British War Cabinet. Such Committees will report to the Imperial War Cabinet which will then assign a day or days for the discussion of the Reports.
It is here assumed that the sittings cf the Imperial War Cabinet will be about .12 in number,though it is quite likely that this number will not suffice;    that they will be confined to 2 or 2-g- hours1&quot; debate in the morning of the day. and will not be continued after lunch;    and that it is desirable to map cut a general plan in advance,  though it is mere than possible that this will he departed from in practice.Upon these assumptions the following sketch plan of the proceedings has been prepared,Date1st Day(March 20th)2nd Hay(March 22nd)3rd Day(March 24th)Sub,] eotGeneral statement by the Prime Minister cnthe objects, position and oontinuahce of the War ,(a) Statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the diplomatic situation.(b.)
