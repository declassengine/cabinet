Reri ew of HJoe-MiJJ.taj^--**^^ the s elf-gavemingDominions and of India during the war, and--suggestions as to the further assistanco which each can render.5htingation.AUSTRALIA.1.     Very early in the War, a combined naval and Military force from Australia seized German New Guinea and other enemy possessions in the Pacific.   At the same time steps were taken to raise a larger Expeditionary Force, and the measure of assistance rendered by Australia in the prfts^nt war can be gauged by the statement that from the outbreak of hostilities to the loth February, 1917, about 287,000 of all ranks had embarked in Australia for service overseas.2.     The initial destination of the Australian troops was Jlgypt whence the greater part proceeded to the Dardanelles.   Not long after the withdrawal of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force frcm Gallipoli, the bulk of the Australian field forces was transferred to France, and the Training Reserve Units were sent to England.At the present moment there are five Australian Divisions serving on the Western Front and a Mounted Division in Egypt,3.     The Imperial Government have recently urged the Commonwealth Government to arrange, not only ts maintain these Divisions but t* commence the formation of a sixth. Railway Operating Units were also asked for.   These proposals have been agreed to by the Commonwealth Government, and of the new Division an Infantry Brigade is now being raised in England.   Railway Operating Troops to the number cf 1,600 are also to be provided.4.     As regards Aircraft, Australia has produced fourcomplete
376complete squadrons, without equipment, of which one is in Egypt.     A small school of aviation has also been formed in Australia,5.   As&apos; regards military labour a request for LabourCompanies for service in Prance was recently addressed to theAustralian Government who replied that none could be provided., *notsince the Commonwealth policy was that all men^fit for general service were required in Australia to enable fit men to be released for service in the field.6.    In Artillery Australia has assisted by providing approximately 100 guns, and has undertaken to supply about 30 miles of rails per month for Prance,7. The whole of the available 1916 wool clip of 147,000 tons&apos;was bought by the Australian Government on behalf of the Imperial Government and it is most important that this policy should be adhered to in regard to next season&apos;s wool clip.The packing industry in Australia should also be developed so as to increase the supply of preserved meat.CANADA.8.    Immediately on the outbreak of war the Canadian Government decided to form an Expeditionary Force and offered to supply 20,000 men.   This offer was accepted and, in less than a month, 40,000 had been raised, with the result that the 1st Canadian Division and Princess Patricia&apos;s Light Infantry arrived in England in the middle of October 1914.   Early in December the latter unit left England for France and joined the 27th Division, while the 1st Canadian Division arrived in France in the second week of February 1915.   At the same time a Base Brigade and Training Depot were formed in England.The expansion of the Canadian Overseas Forces was steadily maintained and up to the 15th February, 1917, the total number of orficers and men embarked in Canada for serviceoverseas
3.377overseas was 284,409.     At present-jfour-CanadianJ^ivajalons and a number of Siege Artillery Batteries are serving in Prance,and the 5th Canadian Division is training in England.     There are also approximately.35,000 Canadian reinforcements fit for general service, training in England, and a further 56,000 undergoing instruction in Canada,With only the above reinforcements in eight, and in view of the probability of early demands for large drafts to maintain the divisions already in the field, the Canadian Government have for the present felt themselves unable to sanction the despatch of the 5th Division to Prance, or to undertake the formation of a 6th Division,-     On the other hand, a number of Railway Operating Units are being raised, and more than 10j000 railway personnel will have been supplied by the end of March, in addition to the labour units referred to in paragraph 10.9,     As regards aviation, at present a scheme for forming 20 Reserve Squadrons in Canada for training pilots is in progress.     The nucleus personnel and the equipment will be sent from England, while Canada has been asked to assist by providing two thirds of the air mechanics required, and in the development of aeroplane and engine manufacture.10.     Pour Labour Battalions, each 1,000 strong, have been raised in England for service in Prance from men not fit for general service, and the Imperial Government have further asked for as many Labour Companies as possible to be formed in Canada for service in Prance.     The Canadian Government are proceeding with their formation, but no data are. yet available as to the numbers likely to be forthcoming.Of the Canadian Forestry Corps some 3,800 of all ranks have been sent to England, and it is hoped that these will soon be followed by 1,100 additional men.     A further request for a fresh contingent of 3,800 forestry men lias been addressed to the Canadian Government, and it is probable thatmore
378more men may still.be required,11.     Nearly 200 guns of various calibre have been received from Canada,..As regards railway material, Canada has supplied us with 2,500 wagons;    is building some 40 locomotives and has offered 300 miles of second-hand track.;     Fifty barges for Mesopotamia and a number of tugs for cross-channel barge service have also been provided.12,      In supplies the Dominion has afforded immense assistance during the war.     It is urged, however, that the packing industry should be further developed in order that more preserved meat may be provided by Canada.     The output of lard also might possibly be increased..IMFOUNDLAND.13-.      In addition to furnishing one battalion and main-taining the necessary reserves, Newfoundland has many men serving in the Imperial Navy, and has now a Naval Reserve of about 1,200,     They have promised 500 or if possible 1000 men for forestry purposes in England..NEW ZEALAND..14.     In August 1914, a New Zealand military force about 1,500 strong captured Samoa..     Later, New Zealand furnished a contingent for service overseas which formed part of the Anzac Corps at Gallipoli, and there are at present in the field a Mounted Brigade in Egypt and a Division in France,15..     Up to the 31st January, 1917, 69,500 of all ranks had been sent overseas, and 10,000 men were under training in New Zealand..     In response to a request from the Imperial Government .for further assistance the Government of New Zealand have undertaken the formation of the nucleus of asecond
3735.second division, andean Infantry Brigade is-being formed in England,16.   Early in 1917, New Zealand was asked to raise as many Labour Companies as possible for service in Prance, but the Dominion Government have replied, that all men not required for comhatant duties with the Expeditionary Fcrce are needed on the land.17.   Between 20 and 30 guns have been supplied by New Zealand.18.    The whole of the 1915 wool clip of 77,000 tons was bought by the New Zealand Government on behalf of the Imperial Government, and it is, important that this policy should be followed in regard to next seas on&apos;s wool supply.The packing industry should also be developed so as to increase the supply of preserved meat from New Zealand,SOUTH &apos; AFRICA. .19o   When war broke out, the Union of South Africa unlike the other Dominions - marched with enemy territory, and to it was entrusted, the subjugation of German South-West Africa.   This&quot; was successfully accomplished, and from first to last some 76,500 South African white troops of all ranks appear to have served in the campaign.20.   Most valuable assistance has also been rendered in German East Africa, where over 30,000 white troops from South Africa have been employed, and in Central Africa where some 2,000 of all ranks have fought.The successful conclusion of the South-West African campaign set free a proportion of the Union troops for. service outside Africa with the result that a contingent of an Infantry Brigade, five Siege Batteries, and certain auxiliary units is now serving in France.   A depot has been formed in England and reinforcements are being raised inSouth
336.South Africa.As troops are freed from East Africa it is hoped that the South African forces in Europe may be increased byat least an Infantry Brigade.21.     As regards aviation, a South African Squadron hasbeen in action for some considerable time.    It is manned chiefly by South Africans but is equipped entirely from England It took part in the campaign in German South-West Africa and is now operating in East Africa.    On the conclusion of the latter campaign it will be placed at the disposal of -the Imperial Government,    It is hoped that the personnel of the existing squadron may be maintained;;    that another squadron may be formed, and that a supply of skilled native artificers for service&apos; in prance may be forthcoming,22*     South Africa has already sent six coloured Labour Battalions., amounting to 11,000 men, to FrancecEarly in January, 1917, a request for 4q,000 additional men for the Native Labour Corps v/as made by the War Office, and a further proposal was put forward that Cape Boys should be raised for service with Horse and Mechanical Transport on the L. of C. in France..    The Union Government have undertaken to do everything possible to raise the additional labour personnel and the Cape Boys required for Horse Transport, but it is not considered practicable to provide suitable personnel for Mechanical Transport Units,233     40 guns have been provided by South Africa.24*     The question of wool from South Africa presents special difficulties.   An attempt was made in November 1915 tc include the South African clip in the Imperial Purchase Scheme, but it fell through owing to the fact that a considerable portion of the clip had already been sold to American buyers..,    This American competition is exerting aserious
3817.serious effect and it is very important that the wool sh.ould.__ he obtained for Imperial &quot;^requirements.Efforts are being made to double the output of hides from South Africa.INDIA.254     Although the military forces in India are primarily maintained for the defence cf India itself, and for limited service overseas in the east, India was nevertheless contributing assistance to the Imperial cause by despatching troops to Europe before the war was many weeks old.    In September 1914, an Indian Arny Corps and an Indian Cavalry Division were sent to France.    In addition, One Division was sent to Mesopotamia;    the equivalent of approximately one and a half Divisions was despatched to Egypt;    two Brigades went to East Africa;    a small force was sent tc Tsing-tao, Germany^ outpost in China;   before the year 1914 I had closed, British troops, to form the bulk of two new Divisions were on their way to England en route for France&apos;; and a second Indian Cavalry Division was completed for the same destination.26.     During 1915 the flow of troops and reinforcements from India continued.   British troops - which had been sent from India to England and there formed into a Division -and seme Indian Regiments landed at Gallipoli;    a second Indian Division and a Cavalry Brigade were sent to Mesopotamia;    and the Indian Force operating in East Africa  , was reinforced.    To compensate for this drain on the military strength of India, three Territorial Divisions were despatched from England. -The climatic conditions in France during the winter of 1914-15 told heavily on the Indian troops and during the latter year, with the exception of the   cavalry,
3828. &apos;they were&apos; all withdrawn and transferred to Mesopotamia and -Egypt. During the summer of 1916 an Indian Cavalry Brigade was transferred from France to Kesopotami a.To sura up, India has sent overseas some 574,000 men, European and Indian (including Camp followers), and it is worthy of notice that while at the out &quot;break of war the strength of the Indian (Native) Army was approximately&apos;250,000, at the present moment it exceeds 430,000&apos;,  exclusive of additional units now being raised and referred &quot;to below.27.    On the 10th November, 1916, the Imperial Government requested the Government of India to raise additional forces with a view to increasing&quot;man-power in the various theatres of war.     In&apos;response&apos;to&apos; this request the Government of India is preparing&apos; to-&apos;-set free&apos; 12 British Territorial Battalions which are to be replaced by European volunteers in India and by Garrison Battalions from home, &quot;and &apos;tb raise 16 new Indian Battalions.    -These latter and&apos;the Territorial&apos;Battalions will both be placed at the disposal of the Army Council for service out side India.   -        -Early this&apos;-year the War Office suggested tint Indian Battalions &quot;serving out si de India, should be brought up to the establishrdent of British Battalions.     This proposal, which would effect an increase- of&apos; approximately &apos;2b% in non-comraissioned ranks without&quot;requiring a corresponding increase in the establishment of British Officers,  is being- favourably considered by the Indian Governments      -A further step towards assisting the Imperial cause was taken in India on February Jtend-,&apos; 1917, when the Indian Defence Force Act was introduced,-&apos;providing for the compulsory enrolment of all European British subjects between 19 and 50 for service in-any part&apos; of India.    &quot; .&quot;
3339,.28.   On the outbreak of war India sent all- her available aircraft resources to England.     These resources were, however, very small.     It is now suggested that native mechanics be enlisted for service in India, Mesopotamia and Egypt,  so as to set free skilled Europeans for service in Europe.29.   Although three coolie corps served in the Dardanelles, and personnel has been provided for railway and inland water transport in Mesopotamia and for railways in East Africa, the labour resources of India do not appear to have yet been drawn on to an extent commensurate with its great population. Negotiations are, however, in progress for replacing a portion of the white personnel of Horse and Mechanical Transport Units and Ammunition Columns, in France and Salonika by natives from India.,- and for additional inland water transport personnel for Mesopotamia.30. . Over 250 guns of various calibre have been provided by India,  exclusive of those sent from India to Mesopotamia. As. regards small arms, troops from India brought 50,000 rifles to Europe in 1914.     An additional 40,000 old pattern were also sent home as being beyond the power of India to repair, and have been :used for training purposes at home.In the important matter of timber supply India has undertaken to endeavour to organise her forestry so as to supply not only her&quot;own requirements but those of theatres other than France with sawn timber,India has found the whole of the material required for railway work in Mesopotamia and the bulk of that for the campaign in East Africa.     Egypt and Salonika have also been provided with rails from India,     Further, a portion of the flotilla operating on the Tigris is supplied by the Indian Government..     It is hoped that, the supply of railway material to Egypt and Salonika may be increased.As
3810.As for machinery, it is suggested that existing railway and industrial workshops in India might supply Mesopotamia, and possibly Egypt and East Africa, with machinery now supplied from England.31.    India is endeavouring to increase sources of supply as regards both raw materials and manufactured articles.   The growing of wheat has been encouraged and a record acreage (32-33 million acres) is hoped for this year.     India is arranging to supply forage for Salonika;,    Italy and Southern France. Proposal have also been made that India should manufacture preserved meat and jam, &apos; and supply tobacco and cigarettes.In view of the essential importance both for war and industry of petroleum oils it is highly desirable.that the existing oil fields in India should be worked to the utmost limit, and that organised prospecting should be undertaken with a view to.the discovery of new oil-bearing areas.It is hoped this year to treble the 1916 export of hides from India.SLWARY.&apos;(i) AUSTRALIA has sent about 28^,000 of all.ranks to take part in the war.     The Imperial Government has urged that further contributions in men should be made.     -This has been agreed to by the Commonwealth Government.    .It is very important that&apos; the policy by which the Australian wool clip is ear-marked for the Imperial Government may be continued, and that steps may be, taken to extend the packing industry so as to increase the supply of preserved meat-       , &apos; . -(ii) Up to 15th February,  1917, CANADA had sent, more than 284,000 officers and men overseas.; &apos; - The
(j J11.The Canadian Government have heen ashed to agree to the despatch of the 5th Division to France and to raise a 6th, hut have replied that.in view of the recruiting situation in Canada they are unable to agree to these proposals at present. Moreover Canada is contributing largely in skilled labour for railway and forestry purposes.It is hoped that no efforts will be spared to raise sufficient additional men to warrant the despatch of the 5th Division early in the summer.It is urged that the supply of preserved meat and lard may be increased. .(iii) 1OWF0UNDLAND has rendered important assistance both to the Royal Navy and. the Army.(iv) NEW ZEALAND has a Division in France and a Mounted Brigade in: Egypt.     An additional Infantry Brigade is now being formed for service.in France,It is urged that the 1917 wool clip may be reserved for the Imperial Government, and that the packing industry may be extended so as.to increase the output of&apos; preserved meat.(v) SOUTH AFRICA has won a campaign and is engaged in two others.     It- is urged that adequate reinforcements for the Brigade in France may be assured, and that if possible a second Brigade for service in France may be raised.Labour, wool and- hides are urgently required from South Africa. . .(vi) INDIA has sent overseas approximately 574,000 of all ranks, European and Indian, including camp followers-. Further she has increased her Indian (Native) Army from about 250,000to 430,000;    is fighting in three continents;   and has responded to further calls made by the Imperial.Government for fighting troops.In view of the recent successes in Mesopotamia, and the favourable effect likely to result therefrom on the military situation in India generally, it should be possible fcr
38612,the Indian Government to release still further troops for service elsewhere in the near future.tlie extent to which further assistance can be given in providing- labour personnel is under consideration by the War Office and the India Office.,As regards supplies it seems that India might assist with railway material, hides, petroleum oils, preserved meat, jam, tobacco and cigarettes to a greater extent than heretofore.!War Office,12th March, 1917.m
