178SECRET.ft CA8/A^8 ,T.SUPPLEMENTARY REPORTON THEDESTRUCTIONOPROUMANIAN OILFIELDS.byLiect.-Col. J. NORTON-GRIFFITHS, D.S.O., M.P.27th January, 1917.(BW/200)   50  3/1T   H&amp;S   4288wo
From Lieut-Colonel Norton-Griffiths to Director of Military Intelligence, War Office r&apos; &apos; London.j &quot;     - /rSir, Jassy, 27th January, 1917.&quot;With reference to my remarks dealing with the financial side of the destruction of oil, which I included in my report of the 22nd January, I have the honour to attach a memorandum which Captain Masterson handed to me this day.I desire to add the following two names which, in error, I omitted to mention :_No. 1384. Orderly (Trooper) William Finch, 2nd King Edwards Horse. For his devotion to duty under difficult and trying conditions while working with one or other officer engaged on the destruction of oil. Trooper Finch played no mean part in doing everything possible to help the Mission in their work.Sergeant Tavu Tonesco, Corps of Automobile Volunteers, Roumanian Army. This non-commissioned officer accompanied Captain Prince Bibesco. Showed exceptional keenness and ability in helping the work of the Mission. He deviated certain Government officials who were often causing trouble and delays, successfully &quot; ditching &quot; a party by slide-slipping his car into a deep ditch. At the moment this was of great importance to me, as it left the party stranded some seven kilometres away until the work was done ; and generally for his technical skill, on more than one occasion, which greatly helped one officer or another in carrying out his duties, sometimes at critical moments.I have, &amp;c,(Signed)      J. NORTON-GRIFFITHS,Lieut. - Colonel.27th January, 1917.MEMORANDUM BY CAPTAIN MASTERSON.On my work of collecting records, I have been able to examine the last balance sheets of 25 of the most important oil companies operating in the Dambovitza, Prahova, and Buzeu districts.It would appear that the book value of plant, machinery, and wells of the largest companies is much below the original cost. This is undoubtedly due to the recent prosperity of these companies (especially the self-contained ones) which allowed of heavy amounts being written off for alleged depreciation.In contradistinction, the book values of the smaller companies are usually inflated.Preliminary investigations showed that the &quot; balance sheets &quot; as a principle for compensation would be the most favourable one to us acceptable, and at any rate indisputable, to the Government, and taken as a whole, perhaps the fairest for the companies concerned.A difficutly arises in a good number of cases where the cost of the land or concession is pooled with the value of the plant or wells, and where this condition goes back to the very beginning of the companies. For such cases experts with knowledge of local conditions will have to be retained in order to advise and to differentiate between such values.Special account will also have to be taken of the heavy tools and materials (such as casing, which is a very important item) which could not be destroyed.The following statement shows the capacity of the storage station for oil and products in the district of Constantza and Jalomitza.The statement shows that on the 1st of January, 1916, the products in the Constantza station alone amounted to 38,770,000 gallons. Since that date the stock must have increased, as at that date there were another four empty tanks and no export was being made. It is, therefore, certain that at least this quantity, less the amount destroyed (and our information tends to show that very little was destroyed), fell into enemy hands when he occupied Constantza on the 10th/23rd October, 1916.In addition to the quantities mentioned above, other reservoirs belonging to the State and private companies outside the town of Constantza, and in the district of Jalomitza, were more or less full of oil and products. The total capacity of these reservoirs was 44,874,000 gallons, and it is reasonable to believe that three-quarters of this storage capacity was filled with oils when the district was occupied by the enemy.Jassy, 27th January, 1917.(Signed)&apos;     J.
