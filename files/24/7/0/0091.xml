434SECRET.&apos; WAR   CABINETG.T. 191.BRITISH SALONIKA FORCE.Summary of information 1st - 28th&apos;February, 1917.1.   General Situation.No operations of any scope have been undertaken by the Allied Armies since the period covered by my last report.    With the exception of the northern movement of the Italian forces from the VALONA area, by which a junction has been effected with French troops moving south from KORICA and a few minor moves and changes which are referred to in the subsequent paragraphs and shown on the enclosed tracing,  the dispositions of the Allied Armies remain as shewn in my report of the 1st February,  the inclemency of , the weather having practically prevented all movement. 2.    Operations. British Forces.In the STRUNA valley on the 16th Corps front heavy rain and the water-logged condition of the country during the earlier part, of the month rendered even patrol activity exceedingly difficult, j:Nevertheless,  in several encounters our patrols, both cavalry and infantry, have maintained their superiority,  inflicting casualties on the enemy and capturing prisoners.On the 12th Corps front, where movement has been less difficult, patrols have been constantly active and the enemy&apos;s trenches have been successfully raided,  thereby keeping up the offensive spirit of the troops.    Of these raids the following carried out for special reasonsafforded/
V 435afforded valuable information:-(a) On the night of the lOth/llth February, after previous demonstrations and wirecutting by artilleryextending over several days, by the 10th Devons (79th Brigadeth26 Division) on the enemy&apos;3 trenches on the PETIT COUROME 1500 yards south of DOIRAN.   After entering the enemy&apos;s works the companies worked their way on to their allotted positions,  clearing trenches as they advanced in spite of strong opposition.   The enemy&apos;s counter-attacks in force were repulsed with heavy loss.   Twenty seven prisoners were captured and it is estimated that the Bulgar losses exceeded four hundred.(b) In order to verify statements made by deserters that the 59th German regiment north of MACUKOVO had been relieved by Bulgarian troops,  a company of the 11th Welsh Pusiliers (67th Brigade, 22nd Division) entered the enemy&apos;s trenches on the PITON DES MITRAILLEUSES on the night of the 21st/ 22nd February,  following close on an artillery barrage. The desired result having,been obtained the company withdrew bringing five prisoners of the German - regiment after having inflicted severe casualties on the remainder of the garrison.I had hoped to be able to withdraw the 179th Brigade from the KATERINI district in order that it might rejoin the 6jd%)ivi sion, but on the 10th February I was requested by General Sarrail to move the Brigade further south and to occupy the PETRA defile, which action I accordingly took. Aviation.Bad weather has to a great extent precluded aerialactivity, but several bomhing raids have been carried outwith success, notably on the HUDOVA aerodrome and on thedepots north of DEMIRHISAR.   On the 18th February in anair/
436, 3.air fight with aFokkor machine a pilot was forced to descend near DRAMA but succeeded in burning his machine, while keeping the enemy at bay with his revolver.The Royal Naval Air Service from Thaso have been constantly active keeping me informed of hostile movement iri south-eastern Macedonia.    They have also carried out several raids on, the railway and rolling:stock in their area.Towards the end of the month considerable aerial activity was shown by the enemy.    On the 26th they carried out a raid in force against the French aerodrome at GORGOP just west of the VARDAR and succeeded in inflicting such damage as necessitated my taking over temporarily from the French the patrolling of that area.   Later in the day a similar raid was made on my aerodrome at JAHES where some casualties but no material damage occurred,   Next day a bombing squadron of 18 German aeroplanes attacked my supply and ammunition depots west of SALONIKA and dropped bombs on the Base Reinforcements.Camp situated on the north side of the town.   Again little material damage was done but over 300 casualties were caused.   Although every avail-able British machine engaged and drove off the enemy only one enemy machine was brought down.    It landed near GUMENDZE in the area of the 122nd French division and the pilot was taken prisoner.In retaliation for the JANES raid of the 26th my machines bombed an enemy depot at CERNISTE on the same evening causing a large explosion while on the night of the 28th February they carried out a very successful retal-iatory raid on another depot at STOJAKOVO.    On the latter occasion nine of our machines dropped ten one hundred pound bombs from a height of 3,000 feet obtaining direct hits on the depot while one machine from a height of only 900 feet successfully bombed an enemy party moving south from STOJAKOVO,   All our/machines/.-
437machines returned safely.Owing to the increase in number and activity of   hostile machines my two squadrons are taxed to the utmost.    I am endeavouring to arrange that the French who have some 150 machines here should provide some relief but have little hope that I shall succeed, as their aeroplanes seem scarcely up to date.    General Sarrail has asked to be supplied with more anti-aircraft guns and better machines.4.     French Forces.During the month the 76th Division has moved from FIORINA to the KORICA district; marching in two columns, one northwest of KORICA and the other southwards.    On the 16th February the western column had reached as far as LUMLAS and   K10CE capturing 60 Austrian prisoners whilst the southern column had occupied.the line KAMLElCA - 907 -PULAHA, taking E5 prisoners.    The southern column then pushed onand by the 18th February had joined hands with the Italians at ErSek; meanwhile the western column had advanced as far as GJONOMAS.       The French are now organising a defensive positionon the left bank of the river DUNAVEC and are concentrating near KORICA the 76th Division while an outpost line is being held by the original KORICA detachment under Colonel Descoins.Detachments from the 16th (Colonial) Division and &apos; other elements have occupied the line PRISOJANI - VRNJANI -IAPSISTA - GREVENA - KAJALAR. On the 23rd February a bandof comitadjis,  200 strong, endeavouring to pass into Epirus were turned back by the presence of Italian and French troops; they then tried to get through to the JANINA - KORICA road and at BURBOSKO   encountered a post of 12 Sengalese all of Hhom they massacred and mutilated.The/

Italian Forces.On the night of the 10th February the enemy launched an attack against the Italian trenches on Hill 1050 fat this point the opposing trenches are 40 yards apart, those of the enemy being on higher ground). Improvised flammenwerfer caused the evacuation of the Italian trenches by two companies who suffered heavy losses.     In a counter attack the Italians re-captured more than two thirds of their losses.   On the 12th February, after a heavy bombardment by artillery and trench mortars the enemy succeeded in occupying more trenches on Hill 1050, the Italians abandoning 5 machine guns and two trench mortars.   A counter-attack failed to retake the whole and fighting continued during the 13th, while by the 14th the Italians had practically recovered the whole position. On the 27th after a heavy preliminary bombardment the Italian infantry endeavoured to retake the portion of the hill still remaining in German hands.     They advanced in two columns, the left one gaining the enemy front line trenches and penetrating to the dug-outs in rear where they took 71 prisoners.   The right column reached the top of the hill itself and ^ere in the act of consolidating when the enemy exploded a mine causing heavy casualties which necessitated a partial withdrawal.   As a result the left column was exposed to enfilade fire, and during the night 27th/28th the whole attacking force was withdrawn to their original line. The summit of hill 1050 is now untenable by either side.   Very heavy losses appear to have been inflicted on the enemy /
439b.during the bombardment preceding this attack.     The Italian losses amounted to 400.     Throughout the month the enemy has shewn considerable artillery and trench mortar activity on this front.Early in the month Italian tro ops in Epirus -pushed northwards occupying ERSEK and BQEOVA and to the west K1ISURA and PREME2I, and by the 18th had effected liaison with the French troops moving south from KORICA as stated in ,the preceding paragraph.     The point of junction of the French and Italians in this area is half-way between CAPA KJANO Pass and EESEX on the KORIGA - LIASKOVIKI road.6.   Serbian and Russian Forces.llo change has taken place in the dispositions of the Serbian and Russian Forces,  except that the whole of the Timok Division isnow with the II Serbian Army. The reorganisation of the Serbian Army has been effected, with the exception of the Shumadi Division which will be completed later.     The period of rest which has been afforded during reorganisation has proved most beneficial to the army as a whole.     Moral has been restored and health conditions are now reported to be excellent.The total effective rifles may now be estimated at approximately 30,000 and it is hoped that this number will shortly be augmented at a rate of two to three thousand per division by tho arrival of reinforcements and return of casualties.As regards the Russians, a few small- raids have been carried out by them with success, otherwise there is nothing of interest to report from their front.7.

A few officers have likewise arrived, but generally there is a great want in the nationalist forces of experienced officers.The guns from the CORFU group of mountain artillery (two batteries) have now been brought over by the.French from CORFU, but it is uncertain yet whether they will be given to1the Greek national troops, or be disposed of otherwise.The last battalion was equipped with the French lebel rifle;   the number of Mannlicher rifles now at the disposal of the national forces being exhausted, future battalions will be equipped in a like manner, and possibly the   existing Mannlichers replaced to avoid differences in ammunition.None of the island divisions will be transported to SALONIKA until they are fully provided with the necessaryequipment, ammunition and stores, regarding which there isstill some delay.A certain number of volunteers have arrived fromEgypt and from Marseilles, but there is no general influx

A good steam-rolled road has been constructed from Salonika to Sarigol for the 12th Corps use, while the supply of the 16th Corps will be greatly facilitated by the end of March when the completion of the SALMANLI - GUVEZNE railway will advance railhead 26 kilometres.When it is possible to push the enemy back at the mouth of the STRUMA, the STAVROS - CAJAZI line can be continued up the STRUMA valley, and the maintenance of the 16th Corps greatly facilitated in the event of a forward movement into Eastern Macedonia.low that the winter may be considered as practically over it is most satisfactory to be able to report that the health of the army was excellent, and that in no-case has the system of supply even of troops in the&apos;M&quot;&apos;.&apos;--V-M- -M,;-;.&apos;most inaccessible places failed, though at times the difficulties were great.
