As the result ox prolonged and repeated conferences between ourselves and officials of the poard of Agriculture and Fisheries, it $ $^agreed that any able-bodied woman of seventeen and upwards:   in. the case of those under twenty-one, with the consent&apos;of parents or guardians) volunteer for ITational Service on the land,     It Is now proposed by Mr.Prothero and Sir Arthur Lee to raise the age to twenty, In view of certain physical and moral objections they feel to the employment of women below that age0V/e are of- opinion that the age should not be higher than eighteen for the following reasons :-1. Eighteen is the statutory age when a young person becomes a woman.     It is also the ago fixed for men In the appeal already issued by the Director General.2. A higher ago would seriously limit the choioeof able-bodied women at t, moment when the national need oalls for the service of every healthy worker of both sexes.3. By such a restriction of the field of possible women volunteers, the National Service appeal for agriculture, might fail to secure the requisite number of workers.4. Any failure of the appeal would react most seriously on the food supplies of the country at a moment when food production is of the utmost importance,5o Granted proper sifting of candidates by the Selection Committees, set up for the purpose, and the medical examination as to physical fitness in doubtful cases, we consider that the physical risks to be run by girls of eighteen are not \suoh&apos; as to justify their exclusion at a moment of great national emergency,6. Granted proper supervision of conditions by the local representatives of the Board cf Agriculture, we do not consider tho moral risks run by women of eighteen are greater titan those run by women of twenty and upwardsIn the case of.the French service the higher age has been, in our opinion, rightly fixed- owing to the special and abnormal conditions of employment overseas.7. The fixing of twenty as the minimum age for agriculture will produce a very: inconvenient situation when women- in industry are dealt with. Toung persons are already engaged in. munitions and work cf national importance of &quot;a character far less
healthy than agriculture.     Moreover, if women    -under tie age of twenty lose thoir employment owing to the damping down of non-essential trades, are they to &quot;be denied the rights and privileges of becoming national service volunteers?8, - If the ago of women volunteers in industry has to correspond with the age In agriculture, employers, no loss .than farmers, will giwfl. the field of labour seriously, and, ih our opinion, unnecessarily restricted at a moment of unparalleled scarcity,9-&apos;   She- fixing of twenty as the ninimum age may affect adversely the corresponding agricultural appeal for Scotland, where many women under that age are already&apos;&quot; employed on the land.10.   We yiald to no one - in our anxiety to secure the best possible conditions of.service for wenon volunteers, or in our wish to safeguard their position when separated from their families.-    But we also fool that at a moment when men are yielding their lives by thousands in the, nation1s causes and are hourly exposed to hardships and perils of the most severe character, there is no desire on the part of women to be held bach artificially from sharing,-If necessary, some of the burthens incidental to a state of unprecedented warfare.    ,As women, wc feel that our., lives and homes have been secured, to us through the sacrifices of, the me zl. and we are confident that we speak for the womanhood of the country in ashing that they should not be   denied-any opportunity of. service-which complements and sustains the service of the firing line.(Intld. ) If. 2.Y.
