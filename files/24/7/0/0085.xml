Lgrams -&quot; SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDON.&quot;Any further communication on t subject should be addressed to -The Secretary, Ministry of Shipping,St. James&apos;s Park, London, S.W., and the following number quoted.NISTfiY OF SHIPPING.16th.March, 1917.Sir,In continuation of Mr.Andersonrs letter of the 8th.instant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the V/ar Cabinet, on the work of this Department, as follows2.    With regard to Merchant shipbuilding, progress has been fairly satisfactory on the whole, but work has been interfered with by bad weather.   Complaints are still being made as to the shortage of supply of material, especially^in the Clyde district.   Tho total amount of wages paid during the last week amounted to  204,830, of v*hich  69,867 was on merchant work.     Ten Munitions certificates have been issued, making the total number of Standard Ships certified sixty, and the total number ordered to date eighty-three.3.     Owing to the difficulties which have arisen with regard to the Piece Work wages paid in connection with the rivetting of standard 3hips building in this country an Arbitration Tribunal is being set up to deal with the mens5 claim for additional wages.4.     With regard to the purchase of ships in North America, contracts have been signed for thirty-six ships of about 310,000 tons deadweight, costing about  10,1130,000 and in addition the Agents of this Department are negotiatingforSecretary, War Cabinet.
for twenty-five ships of about 191,000 tons deadweight.It a cost of about  7,750,000. Offers have been made for 124 ships in all, of about 731,000 tons deadweight, esti-mated to cost about  28,000,000.5.     The Director of Overseas Ship Purchase of this Department is experiencing great difficulty in negotiating for ships building for Norwegian owners in the United States of America, as the majority of the holders have hitherto re-fused to entertain any proposals except on the basis of pay-mcnt in kroners in Bergen.     Owing to the state of the Nor-wegian exchange it has not been found possible by the Treasur to make the necessary arrangements for payment in kroners and this has caused the Department to losa nine ships of ahout 75,000 tons deadweight that would otherwise have been accepted.   As these ships were due for delivery during the current year, the loss is a very serious one,6.    The requisitioning of liners has been further l extended, and arrangements have been made for the appointment of several Committees of Owners to undercake th-&apos; details of management.   The Controller will be represented en these Committees.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd) Graeme Thomson
