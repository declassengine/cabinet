The sinkings of merchant tonnage, as officially reported in the period March 9-15 are heavy; last week they were exceptionally light.Steamships (500 tons gross &amp; over):-British Ueutral67,272 62,732Sailers (100 tons gross &amp; over, omitting smacks &amp; trawlers) :-British leutral2,928 8,0171&apos;otals:-British ...   70,200Neutral ...    70,749Grand Total :-   140,949PEIMA.RIC. Our pacific blockade of Denmark continues, and allcargoes bound for that country are detained, on one pretext or another, at Halifax or in a port of the United Kingdom.   Already this silent pressure is pro-ducing the desired effect.     The Germans, it is true, have intervened to save Denmark from a coal-famine; in the first week of March they supplied her with 60,000 tons of coal, coke and briquettes.   But it is doubtful whether they can maintain this rate of supply, and improbable that any patriotic Dane wishes to see his country dependent on Germany for coal.   Pood-stuffs and fodder-stuffs the Germans cannot supply;   and the Danish population are not likely to endure a shortage of these commodities without making a strong protest against the selfish policy of the ship-owners.
.   368- 2 -Already the two great Danish shipping companies - the Bast Asiatic and the United Shipping Co. - are making arrangements to meet our demands,   The United Shipping Co. have offered to carry our accumulated stocks of Danish produce from Bergen to the United Kingdom. Three ships are ready to make this voyage as soon as their crews are complete;   three others are only waiting to bej insured by us.   Mr. Andersen, of the East Asiatic Co., proposes to found a new line, with a capital of 20 million kronor. to maintain a regular service with the United Kingdom.   The vessels of the line, which are to &quot;be found by the East Asiatic and the United Shipping Cos., will bring fish and produce and will return to Denmark with coal and general cargo.   The profits of the line will be divided among the crews;   this liberal offer should bring the strike, of the seamen and firemen to a speedy termination, even though their unions have funds infcand for six weeks.   Mr. Andersen, has, how-ever, not yet agreed to all the conditions which we exact for return-cargoes of coal.It appears from official figures that in January we received from Denmark 63.7J&amp; of the total export of butter; 66.9^ of the total export of bacon; 60fo of the total export of eggs.   These figures show that our Agricultural Agreement is not unsuccessful in diverting supplies from Germany.   But Germany received from Denmark in January 3,483 tons of dairy produce and 8,707 tons of meat-stuffs and animal fats, besides 17,000 head of live cattle.
369- 3 -NORWAY. Between l&apos;eb. 18 and March 9 there were 59sailings from Bergen to the United Kingdom.   Norwegian owners show an increasing confidence in our protected routes.   We have arranged for the prompt supply of coal cargoes to Norwegian ships which bring approved cargoes to the United Kingdom.     The Norwegian Prime Minister is now convinced that the best way of ensuring a constsnt coal-supply, and of protecting Norwegian vessels, is to recognise our policy of re-quisitioning by consent,   we are asking in the first instance if we may requisition sufficient tonnage to maintain trade between this country and Norway.     For the rest, we offer to Norwegian vessels the same bunker facilities as our own receive throughout the world, if all that are not required for Norwegian imports and exports are put into Allied trades.We are arranging, through the Hio Tinto Co. to buy from the Norwegian producers of non-cupreous pyrites the whole exportable surplus of that article, which would otherwise go to Germany to be used in manufacturing sulphuric acid.   We are also negotiating with the Norwegian Government for a more severe res-triction of fish-exports to Germany.SWEDEN. France will adhere to the Anglo-Swedish Agreement,(if it is concluded), on certain conditions, of which the chief is that neither country shall demand com-pensation for exports made to the other.   Considering the importance of Swedish products to French munition
370- 4 -works this is a wise provision.The submarine blockade has interrupted the des-patch of Swedish Iron Ore to this country.   About 1,000,000 tons are now at Narvik awaiting shipment.Swedish merchant shipping is still to a great extent in harbour.   None comes to the United Kingdom even for coal.   We are therefore exporting nothing to Sweden and are unable to purchase facilities for transit^ ing goods to Kussia over the Swedish railways.   We are in the debt of the Swedish Government for past faesili-ties and they have granted no transit licences for the past three or four weeks;   over 30,000 tons of goods destined for Kussia are lying at Swedish and Norwegian ports and railway stations.   In the near future 100,000 tons of agricultural machinery will be coming forward for transit;   and the Russian Government talk of importing 9,000 tons of railway material by the same route.THERIANDS. The latest figures show that our Agreement forthe purchase of Dutch Produce is working well.   We have received more than the stipulated quantities of cheese, milk and bacon, and a very large quantity of flax-seed which was badly needed in Ireland.   Some cargoes of fertilisers are accordingly being released from British ports.The Dutch fishing-fleet has resumed operations under assurance from the German Government that it mil not be molested.   We are negotiating with the Trawlers Association who demand some modifications of their Fish Agreement.   We hope to secure 40$ of the catch.
- 5 -371in which ease Germany would receive 30$.She Dutch Government have not yet given way on the ease of the &quot;Princess Melita&quot;; they are afraid of provoking the German Government, who have actually demanded that the ship shall be interned.   But Sir Walter Townley does not think that Germany would make it a easus belli if armed merchantmen were declared free to enter Dutch ports; and p?-7esumably we shall continue to press for such a declaration.The regular Dutch lines (about 20 vessels) are now ready to resume sailings between Holland and the united Kingdom.   The Dutch Government will provide insur-ance for these vessels.   As soon as they begin to arrive the cargoes of food-stuffs which have been detained will be allowed to go forward to Holland.   The Dutch Government have offered that certain Dutch ships shall be appropriated to the service of carrying coal for depots on the routes to South America, provided that the remainder are allowed to resume their usual trades..SPAim. negotiations are in progress for about 30$ of thetonnage belonging to the port of Bilbao to be time-chartered to the Shipping Controller.SWITZERLAND. The Federal Government have opened negotiationswith Germany for a renewal of the German-Swiss Agreement. Our delegates at Berne have been instructed to sign the revised S.S.S. Agreement, obtaining the best terms they can on the points which are still outstanding.M, Denys Cochin considers that there is nothing to be gained by purchasing the Swiss surplus of live cattle.   But it is hoped that he may reconsider this
372- 6 -1   opinion.   If the Allies do not purchase the Germans will obtain about 100,000 head of Swiss cattle (addi-tional to their previous purchases) before the end of the summer.ilTBD STATES. On March 12 all foreign representatives atWashington were notified that the United States Govern-ment propose to place an armed guard on every American vessel   which is bound for the blockade area.   No further difficulties, it appears, will be raised about the armament of foreign merchant vessels which enter or clear from United States ports.   Already a French vessel has been allowed to clear with one gun forward and another aft, whereas guns forward were previously disallowed.H.w.C.D.3War Trade Intelligence Department.
