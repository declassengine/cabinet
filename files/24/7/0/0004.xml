SECRET G.T-104WAR CABINET.TRANSPORT^gQgjgBS BATTALIONS AND LABPJ^^TgE..j^,OKg.(Letter from Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee to Secretaryof Mr,Illingworth&apos;s Committee)1st; March 1917Sir,This- Committee had before them to-day the Minutes of the Far Cabinet of the 19th February,: and.your recent correspondence with Sir Herman Hill.1.     In regard to the actual Dock Work, this Committee is of&quot; opinion that the deficiencies in labour can only be effectively met through the men of the Transport Workers Battalions, and under existing conditions, they are further of opinion that it will be sufficient if the strength of those Battalions is brought, up to-.the promised 10,COO.xf-the flow of traffic over the Railways can be materially improved, then further men may be:required in the Docks,/The last Heturns obtained by the Board of Trade show that in the 55 ports at which Port Labour Conimittees have been established, there are now 113,000 Dock Workers available. , If the standard of efficiency of the individual worker had been maintained,- this number should be sufficient to deal with the traffic of those ports under normal conditions.The standard of efficiency has, however, been reduced wing-to the enlistment of so many of the younger men, and what is of even greater importance,. is the fact that it is impossible to maintain an even flow of traffic.     Por example,, owing to the submarine risks, the ore ships are from time to time held up,. with the result that a port may have little, cargo to handle one week, but be overwhelmed with work the next.     Again, the reguis-itioning of vessels;.throws an unusual:;-amount of work on the regular Lines, and therefore on the ports to which those Lines trade;   but the extent of this, additional .traffic, is also subject to very considerable fluctuation.    ..In organising Labour in the ports, the first, necessity is the employment of all the existing Civilian Labour to its fullest capacity..   The position would not be helped.by increasing per-manently the amount of Civilian. Labour available, by either, releasing men from the Army or by obtaining men under the National Service Scheme,.    What is needed is a-mobile, force to deal with  -ieficiencies; in Civilian.Labour in particular ports, as and when they arise,; and.this;force must be used only to supplement and not displace; the Civilian Labour.     Prequently, ]the additional&apos;  \\ labour-is only re quired, in a port for a few days:and generally the amount of help- required varies from week to week, and sometimes from day to- day. -   In providing this additional labour&quot;: it is as important that it be withdrawn, from &quot;the port immediately its work has been done., as that it should be immediately avail- &quot; aoie &apos;.vhen its help is needed..   . To get the best work out of yivilian Labour,, it must be given every chance to do the work dnd to earn the pay...
bet-fa)To meet these conditions, the additional labour must Under disciplinesCb)     Mobile.(c)     Independent of the work in the ports, e.g. it musthave other work to turn to whenever it is not required in the ports. . *In.the opinion^ of,this Committee, these-conditions can only &quot;be fulfilled: through an organisation such as the Jruisport Workers Battalions.To attempt to introduce unto the ports, men under the Hational Service Scheme to compete, or even to appear.to coihnete, with the existing Civilian Labour would &quot;be most hazardous.,Carters and -Railway WorkersV-in the Ports. Until the Railwayposition is clearer, this Committee&quot; is &quot;not able to form anopinion as to whether there is apermanent or----only a temporaryand fluctuating shortage of carters in the ports.If the shortage is constant-, then help could with advantage &quot;be given under the national Service Scheme.     If the shortage is temporary and fluctuatinf;, then it should he dealt . with through the Battalions.The Railway Executive Committee-is, it is understood, reporting on its labour requirements, both in the ports, end at the destinations to which the Roods are sent.. Canals-This Committee is already in communication with, thenewly anointed Canal Committee, hut it is not yet in a position to advise as to the extent of the shortage of Labour in these cervices., or as to the steps necessary to relieve the -Railways.Speaking generally, this Committee is of opinion that the organisation is of as miich importance as the supply,of additional labour,   : Unless careful provision he made to protect and encourage Civilian labour, the State&apos;s intervention may do far more harm than good.&apos;... So far as the Ports are concerned, this Committeeis r strongly of opinion that the negotiations with the War Office and the Director of National Service should be left in its hands.Thebeing used: by the transit, so as to under: - ,more important Port accommodation which is now: Government for purposes other then ocean -interfere, with the free flow .of traffic:: isLiverpool, S-andon Dock-principally&quot;as.a Hbmo&quot;bupply Depot.Avonmouth; The maintenance of a Home: Supply Depot imposes a -great strain on the Dock Siding Accommodation, and Engine Power for purposes entirely unconnected with the import and export of Oversea.
