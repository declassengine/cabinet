In England and Wales there are now 41 County Organising Secretaries.IV.;SUPPLIESMachinery Section.The Department have purchased from various sources 21 tractors which, in addition to one released from Arm:/ service, makes with the 32 reported last week., a total cf 54 tractors owned by the Department in this country.     All of these with the exception of 2, which are not in working order, have been placed at the disposal of County Committees.,  and it is expected that the remaining 2 will be similarly disposed of &quot;in a few days.     An appeal has been issued to private owners to lend their tractors to the Department, and only two have, so far, refused.Twenty-e ight
Twenty-eight privately-owned tractors have been placed under the Department&apos;s control.     The provision of labour, supplies, and maintenance from civilian sources for tractors working under the control of the Department, has been completed, and 31 motor agents have been appointed as District Organisers for the purpose of superintending such work.      Thirty-five &quot;Titan&quot; tractors ordered by the Department have just arrived at Liverpool, and arrangements are being made for the unpacking and dispatch of these to the County Committees to whom they have been allocated.

A statement has been prepared for the information&quot;ef&quot;War&quot;Agricultural Committees and farmers, indicat-ing the general position as regards supplies of fertilisers at the present time.     This has been included in the weekly Bulletin, Copies have also been sent to a number of correspondents.Transport.     The Railway Executive Committee have Issued instruc-tions that Sulphate of Ammonia and Fertilisers generally should be considered second in importance only to Government and munition traffic.      So far as can be judged, no very serious delay is occurring in the transport of fertilisers at the present time, and these instructions will do much to hasten delivery.     A. number of complaints as to the non-delivery of basic slag arise from the fact that one large works has sold all its stock and can only deliver as the material is produced.Sulphate of Ammonia-     The Sulphate of Ammonia Advisory Com-mittee&quot;&quot;are receiving enquiries at the rate of from 200-300 per day.     A large number of contracts have been fixed and farmers are either referred to reliable merchants, who are known to hold supplies or are supplied direct by the Committee.     Local Committees are being formed to facilitate distribution.Sulohate of Copper.       A notice has been issued in regard to the price at-which sulphate cf copper is to be sold.     The manu-facturers have agreed to sell for home consumption at  50 per ton while the retail price is not to exceed 6 id. per lb.     The price prior to this agreement was about  63 per ton but the majors reduced the home price to  50&apos; in consideration of the fact that such quantities as were not needed for use in this country should be alloaed to be exported.Stocks in possession of Dealers.      Information is being ccllect-ed as to &quot;the&quot;stcck&apos;s of fertilisers held by dealers and the extentto which these stocks are already sold. n . *J Conferences.
Conferences.     A meeting was held with representatives of the Co-operative Societies affiliated to the Agricultural Organisa-tion&quot;Society at which their position in regard to the distrlbu-tion of fertilisers and feeding stuffs was discussed.The subject of oilcakes has been discussed with Mr. Bigland.     It is suggested that, as in the case of fertilisers, the Ministry of Munitions should deal with all matters relating-   . to the manufacture and production of oil-cakes while this Depurt-ment will be responsible for their distribution.The French Government are pressing for supplies of Sulphate of Ammonia and Sir Edmund Smith (C.I.R.) who Is in Paris this week with Mr.. Albert Stanley,  called before leaving London to ascertain whether we would allow any exports..     He was informed that for the present we couLd premise nothing except the libera-tion of about 500 tens for which licences had already been granted but had lapsed..SEED SECTION,Potatoes..     During the week the Department have been in frequent communication with the Irish Department, but until yesterday had secured the release of 150 tons of seed only.     The Department&quot; are very anxious to obtain ploughs, and negotiations have been begun for the exchange of potatoes for ploughs,I addressed a letter to the &quot;Scotsman&quot; newspaper appealing to Scotch farmers to estimate their own requirements for seed without delay and to sell any surplus in time for planting- in England.A list of English; growers&apos;likely te hold stocks cf potatoes has been prepared, and also a list of those farmers who are delivering considerable quantities of cooking potatoes to the the Army Canteen Committee.     Any potatoes suitable for seed will be purchased on behalf of the Department by dealers knowing the localities in which the crops were grown.Oereals..     . A letter has been sent to the National Association of British and Irish Millers asking their members to reserve for Seed any wheat (of four varieties)  suitable for late sowing which they may have in ste-ek or which rnay be offered to them during, the next few weeks.Certain districts which have hitherto depended on Ireland for seed oats are being inconvenienced by the pro-hibition of export from Ireland.      This will raise the price of seed *ats locally, but supplies from other sources can be rbtaincd..I am,.Sir,Your obedient Servant,hi Rt, Hon. Rowland E..Prothere, M.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture find Fisheries
