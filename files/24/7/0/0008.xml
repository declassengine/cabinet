&apos;/Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ Governmentw -        -- ^^SECRET.INDIAN BULLETIN.  No. 2.;   EXPLANATORY NOTES.1.. New Formation?!.-The Government of India undertook to have three battalions ready for embarkation for Mesopotamia by the end of February to release British battalions for service at the main British, front. Three battalions, namely, Guides Infantry, 87th Punjabis and 1/6th Gurkhas, have embarked for Mesopotamia. The Viceroy&apos;s telegram shows that four out of the 13 battalions to be newly raised to take the place of these Indian battalions proceeding to.Mesopotamia are now complete, and that progress is being made with the completing of the remainder.The&apos;recruitment of labour battalions for service in France, which the Government of India have begun, is in accordance with, the request of the War Office that the Indian Government should raise at once for employment in France 20,000 labourers, selecting only such men as would be able to stand the climate of North-West Europe. Preliminary measures (involving-no expenditure) are being taken with regard to the raising, of a further - 30,000. &apos; &apos;     . &apos; &apos;. . .A number of Indian officers and men have left France for Arabia to join the Sheriffs forces as instructors.J. Internal Condition. A note on the Home Rule agitation was given in the first Indian Bulletin. The Viceroy now reports an agitation for the suppression of indentured labour.The Government or India proposed at the end of 1015 that the system of labour emigration under indenture to Fiji and certain West Indian Colonies should be abolished, and the Secretary of State in Council has accepted this in principle, and has been in close consultation with the (Colonial Office with the purpose of framing a suitable system for the emigration to these Colonies of free labourers from India, with proper, safeguards for their welfare. The indentured emigration system has long been unpopular among Indian politicians, main.lv because they consider.that the status o  the coohes in the Colonies is inconsistent with Indian self-respect.; As it has been declared to be impossible to abolish the old system immediately without giving the Colonies time to readjust their industrial arrangements, the agitation in India is taking the form of laying stress on the moral conditions among Indians in Fiji due to the preponderance of males, somewhat exaggerated accounts of which have been brought to India. An inter-departmental conference between the India and Colonial Office, to devise a new system of free emigration, has been fixed for May. ;.. In the meantime shipping difficulties, and the demand for Indian labour for military purposes, will probably prevent the despatch to the Crown Colonies of the emigrants who had engaged to sail during the next few months.Telegram from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for half month ending.2&amp;th February 1917.3026.   Reference to correspondence ending with your telegram of 22nd ultimo.   Following bi-monthly report is submitted:-   /1.

Orders are being issued to begin recruitment of labourers for Europe in accordance-with sanction just received.2. Munitions. Mechanical transport workshops are being expanded to lessen demands on England for spares, &amp;c, for mechanical transport, and it is proposed to initiate manufacture in: India of bodies for lorries and. other Government motor vehicles.. Up to 21st February, 6-3 miles of 75-lb. rails with 200 plates manufactured byTatas had been shipped, of which 43 miles were for Egypt and 20 for Salonika. Large supplies of sleepers are being despatched to Egypt and Salonika early in March, and further arrangements are being made to obtain timber from Burma to meet possible future requirements there and in Mesopotamia.. 3. SuTPUliS. We hope to be able to cancel our demands on England for soap by encouraging an increased output in Indian factories and to lessen our demands for such supplies as jams and tinned vegetables by drawing directly more on Australia. Output of wool blankets increased by about 10,000 last month and we hope to make no further demands on England for mittens and balaclava caps. Indians production of cotton materials and the introduction of local substitutes for imported materials-have received, special attention.-1. Internal CoNDJTiON.:-Home rule agitation continues and is supple-mented by another vigorous agitation for the suppression on moral grounds of. the indentured labour system. Exclusion of the inflammatory agitators Tilak Pal and Mrs. Besant from certain. Provinces has provoked, as was to be expected, hostile criticism, but has otherwise had salutary effect. Lull in political outrage in Bengal continues, and crime in the Punjab is below normal. Defence Force Bill, restriction of railway traffic and other recent developments have resulted in recrudescence of&quot; fantastic war rumours, including one lhat Amir has invaded India and that Japanese troops have arrived to help us. Tone of the Imperial Legislative Council now in session has on the whole been critical but good tempered.
