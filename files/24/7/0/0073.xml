SSOBET WAR CABINET.G.T.-17SIiTAirCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DOMIUIOIIS BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GCVERffHEifT. Eajats regarding Imperial Assistance to the Dominions,(Memoranda by the Treasury in connection with&apos;Imperial WarCabinet Sittings)I.Direct financial as si stance from His Majesty&apos;s Exchequer.Boon after the outbreak of war it was decided that, with a view of avoiding the disadvantages of the separate flotation &quot;by each Dominion of the loans required to meet war expenditure, His Majesty&apos;b Government would undertake to advance to the Dominion Governments the sums required out of the proceeds of any general War Loan of Loans which might be raised by His Majesty&apos;s Government.These arrangements v;ere formally placed on record in Treasury Minute dated 17th November 1914, of which copy is annexed.The general principle of these arrangements was that the Dominions should be made partners with the United Kingdom in War Loans raised by His Majesty&apos;s-Government in the United Kingdom, that is to say, the Dominions would bear a share of the charges incurred by the Government of the United Kingdom in raising these funds proportionate to the share they have taken in the proceeds of the respective loans.The money required is lent to the Dominions at the rate of interest at which His Majesty&apos;8 Government Itself borrows, and the discount on any interest bearing securities issued at a discount is added to the capital of the debt owing by eaoh Dominion.   The Minute provides also that the debts due to His Majesty&apos;a Government from each of the Dominions will be paid off out of public issues of stock or securities to be made at such times as may be agreed upon as suitable between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Dominion Government.Further, the understanding is that if at the time of repayment the securities, out of the proceeds of -which the original advance was made, stand at a discount a corresponding abatement, and if they stand at a premium a corresponding increase will be made in the capital amount repayable.The Minute contemplated that the advances would be made out of the proceeds of general War Loans, i.e. loans raised otherwise than by the issue of short term securities, and the ftaehinery for repayment originally prescribed corresponded to this asumption.
TJd to IE November 1915 tho advances to the Dominions -unit or the&quot;terms of this Minute were provided out of either the Stfo war Loan or the 4-^- T7ar loan.   But?from 13 lovember 1915,&quot;by &quot;h-ich time the proceeds of ^ the 4?$ &apos;7ar Loan had &quot;been&apos; exhausted, up to the issue of the 4 S and 5^ l/ar itoans in 1917, the money required was necessarily provided out of tho proceeds ox tho short term obligations which were issued to finance the war 6   Between 13 Ilovomber 1915 and 13 July 1916 the money was provided out of the proceeds of :5fi Exchequer Ponds.   Irom the 14th July onwards when, following an increase in the bank rate, tho selling rates for Treasury Pills at the Bank of England were raised, the proportion of money raised by tho issue of Treasury Jills very substantially exceeded the proportion raised by the sale of Exchequer Bonds.   It was impossible to earmark tho precise source from which the advances to the Dominions were provided and from 13 July 1916 up to the issue of the new V/ar Loans in 1917 the advances have boon treated as provided generally out of the proceeds of short term obligations, and tho rate of interest payable by the Dominions lias been taken at 5tr^ that being approximately tho average cost to the Treasury, of raising money &quot;by tho salo of chert- dated securities in the period in question, the&apos; understanding being that the rate of interest would bo revised and tho terms of capital repayment fixed Co&apos;: soon as arrangements then in force for raising money by short term securities wore replaced by some more permanent form ox loan.In so far as money has boon provided from short term obligations, the liability of the Dominion is, in theory to provide for the repayment of the corresponding advance on the maturity of the obligation out of which the advance was maae, but it Is understood that as short term obligations are renewed the advantage of renewal would bo given to tho Dominions and actual payment of the capital will not bo called lor until tho general settlement after tho &quot;.7ar0Tho oxaoir &quot;terms upon which advances have boon made out of tho several obligations issued by His Majesty1 s S-ovornment are as follows:-advances made out of tho proceeds of the 3-^ &quot;.:ar Loan Capital liability      100 for every  95 cash advanced.Interest  3*10/- per annum for every&apos; 95 cash or  100 capitalsAdvances made cut of tho proceeds of tho        Par Loan,Capital  100 for every  99 cash advanced,liabilityInterest  4.10/- per annum, for every  99cash or  100 capital.Advances made out of 50&quot;; Bwchequor &quot;londs.Capital  100 for every  100 cash advancedliabilityInterestper annum:.
3 -Advances made- out of general proceeds of short term securities (Capital liability not finally determined).Interest 5^ per annum, Pendingr e-arrangement *In cases whore the advance has been made out 6f tlie proceeds of a security which has subsootiently been con-verted into a security carrying a different rate of interest, the obligation of the fteminion in respect 62 the original advance has &quot;been adjusted, thiis advances made to the Dominions out of the proceeds of the       V/ar Loan carried an obligation to repay  100 (subject to adjustment for discount or premium) in ro spent of each  95 of cash advanced and interest meanwhile at but when a portion of the SJ^S ..&apos;ar Loan was convertedintoV/ar Loan the obligation of the Dominions in respect&apos; of advances mad-o^out of jprocoods of the 2*$o &quot;.7ar Loan was, con-vortod into a 4jj$ obligation in the ratio eoirr/o spending io that in which the total amount of       7/ar Loan had been converted into       War Loan.    L similar adjustment id. 11 be required (subject to one reservation as regards dobt converted into bonds as explained &quot;below) as the result of conversion into the new War&quot;Loans just issued.It will be agreed that when the war is over it will be desirable that the indebtedness cf the Dominions&apos;to tho United Kingdom should bo liquidated ad soon as possible,   This can be done if the Dominions will issue their own loans in the United Kingdom and will either buy the Imperial Government obligations earmarked to the Dominions1 indebtedness for cancellation, or will hand over to the Imperial Government cash sufficient to&apos; the amount, from time to timej necessary to buy these obliga-tions at the current market priceaTho amount of cash advanced by the United Kingdom to the several Dominions and the obligations earmarked against those advances are set out in the annexed tablo (1).   The obligations created as against these advances, taken at 31 December, 1916, are shorn in table 2.The capital liability .of the several Dominions was originally sot up as a book debt in the bocks of the Treasury but in 1915 tho Dominions on a suggestion of the Treasury very readily agreed to supply in substitution for book dobt in tho books of the Treasury Dominion Bonds which could be pledged as collateral for Imperial Government loans in America,     The amounts and denominations of tho bonds so   &apos; supplied by each Dominion is shown in tablo 3.    The corros-ponding book dobt has been cancelled, and in respect of book debts so cancelled and replaced by negotiable bonds, the Governments of the Dominions have been relieved of any further liability on account of conversion.   .
II.FACILITIES HORDED j?OR BORROWING II THIS LOHDOH EiRKESIn tho early months of tho War the Treasury took no offioial steps&apos;to prevent or control fresh capital issues in the London market and tho Government of lev?-South V/alos borrowed in the London market  1,000,000 in October, and  1 750,000 in. Efoveabor, without formal consultation with or approval by the treasury by tho issue of Treasury Bills in the London market.     Canada again.inMIovembor 1914 raised  3,000,000 by tho Issue of Treasury Bills.Exit on January 19th, 1915 tho Treasury announced that until further notice it was felt to bo imperative in the national interest that fresh issues of capital should be approved by the treasury before they were made,The notice explained that issues or participations In issues for luidertakings carried or to bo carried on in the British Empire Over-seas would only bo allowed whore it is shown to the satisfaction of tho Treasury that urgent necessity and special circumstances exist.     The treasury added that In ordinary casos they would hot&quot;insist upon the above restrictions where issues are required for the renewal of Treasury Bills or other short Instruments held hero and dalling duo of foreign or colonial governments&apos; (among others).Immediately after this announcement conferences were hold at the Treasury on January 26th and Litrch 6th 1915 with a view to determining tho financial policy to bo adopted in tho oaso of the -dominions.Tho principles laid down in the Treasury Minute of 17$h Ifovembcr 1914 (Appendix A. ) were ro-affIrmcd, namely, that the Imperial Government would advance to the Dominions the amounts required for their v/ar expenditure on tho terms&apos; on which His Majesty1^ Government itself raised money for the prosecution of the &quot;Jar.In regard to expenditure not falling under the category of war expenditure it was decided that the Dominions should do allowed to borrow in the open market such sums, but &apos;only such sums, as they could satisfy the Treasury were required, on separate application In each case.Since that date the following loans have been raised in the London market, with the. exoreios sanction of the ;.&apos;reasur in each case, by the Dominions, and the States of Australia.

334Appendix &quot;A&quot;Treasury. Hinuto, dated the -17th ifovember, 1914, relating toi Advances to Ilia Majesty&apos;B Self-Groverning Dominions.The Chancellor of tho Esohoqnar calls tho attention of the Board to the arrangements which have &quot;boon made Tilth the Govern-monts of certain of the Dominions with a view to avoiding the disadvantages bf the separate flotation &quot;by each Dominion of the loans required to meet the heavy expenditure entailed by the present crisis.So far as they eon be estimated at present, the amounts required are :^Dominion of Canada ...     .,.     ... 12*000,000Cemmonwe&amp;Lth of Australia ... 18,000,000Dominion of Tew Zealand   ...     ...   5,250,000Union of South Africa......1,000,000It Is proposed thai tho sums required by the Dominion Governments from time to1,time should bo advanced to them out of the proceeds of any general war loan or loans whioh may bo raised by His J&amp;jesty1 s Government; i.o., of a&amp;y loan raised otherwiso than by short-term securities, such as tho six or twelve- months Treasury Bills by which tho oost of the war has hitherto hoon provided for.The object of thoso advances is to provide funds to meet the ffaval and Military expenditure incurred by the Dominions aid other charges directly due to the crisis.     They ore not intended to be applied to financing development cervices.The sums advanced are to be- epplied primarily to meet the obligations of the Dominions in the United kingdom in respect of debt services and purchases in tho English market, thus setting free (in so far as thoso obligations represent expenditure not ail sing out of the crisis) a co rresponMng sum in the Dominions for local war expenditure.     Save in very exceptional circiimstances (e.g., where separate naval or military operations   are being carried on by the Dominion itself), no part of tho advances is to be used for cash remittances from the United kingdom.The money will be lent to the four Dominions named at the rate of interest at which His ilajesty&apos;3 Government itself will have borrowed, the discount on any interest bearing securities issued at a discount being added to the capital of the debt.     The amounts paid over to the Dominions from time to time in res-sect of the advances will be charged to tho Ypto of Credit.The debts duo to His Majesty&apos;s Government from each of the dominions will be paid off out of public issues of stock or securities to be made at such times as may- be agreed upon as suitable b ewe on the Chancellor of the exchequer and the Dominion Government.cutIf at the time of repayment the securities of the pro-oeeds of which the original advance was made stand&apos; at a dis-count a corresponding abatement, and if they stand at a pre-mium a corresponding increase will be made in the amount repayable.
335Ponding the issue of a general war loan, arrangements have &quot;boon made where necessary for tho Bank of England to make temporary advances to the Dominions in anticipation of the 3o an upon tho understanding that such temporary advances (which will ho included in the totals specified above) .will be repaid by tho Treasury to the Sank of England on behalf of tho Dominions concerned so soon as the proceeds of tho first general war loan arc available.My Lords approve.Jtot directions,be given accordingly and let a copy of this Minute be transmitted through the joldnial Office to the Governments of tho Dominions concerned,
