433COPYSECRET G.T. 190WAR   CABINET.Erom General Hanbury Williams to Sir W. Robertson.16/3/17839.   Owing to delay in reaching power in present political crisis, Socialist party has successfully contaminated the hitherto &quot;loyal to the war&quot; workmens1 unions.     I would accordingly suggest that our own Labour party should send a message to the Socialists and workmens&apos; unions in Petrograd, urging them not to fO/rget for one instant in the excitement of present events, that the enemy is still at the gates, and also the vital importance to the future of labour in Europe that this enemy should be     unreservedly defeated.Every day which is lost in the preparations necessary &apos; to this end means playing directly into the enemy&apos;s hands. Is above suggestion in your opinion feasible?Reply sent to General Hanbury Williams that his suggestion has already been acted upon.
