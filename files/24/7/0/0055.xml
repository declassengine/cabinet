The stock of oats is low, having fallen from 9,o23,000 quarters on February 1, to 5,742,000 on Larch 12.BarleyThe supplies available for food have been greatly in-creased by the addition of the supplies in the hands of the maltsters.     The maltsters&apos; stocks were estimated, on February 10, at 1,890,000 quarters.     It is calculated that about 1,000,000 quarters might be held for a period of 3 months without deterioration, and the Pood Controller has asked the Wheat Commission to consider a scheme with the object of keeping this as a reserve, which will be available for breadmaking until June next.LaizeThe supplies of maize have steadily improved during the past 3 weeks.
ft)be at.- The main source of meat supply is in the lorae herds and flocks.

The number of cattle in 1916 was the highest ever re-corded, and the number of sheep the highest since 1912. The returns from over 40 of the largest markets show that in the last six months of 1916 (i.e., after the annual census of livestock in June) 239,43-5 fat stock were expooed for for sale as against 297,917 - the average 1913-1915 - and in the first ten weeks of 1917 the number cf fat stock ex-posed for sale has been 118,522 as compared with 127,166 -the average 1913-1915.    There is therefore direct evidence that despite the fact that the herds of cattle are the high-est on record the slaughter of cattle has been under normal.As regards imports of meat the following statement shows the imports of meat in the first 10 weeks of 1915, 1916 and 1917 and for the first quarter of 1913.WEEKLY IMPORTS in 1,000 cwts.Period.

(c ) 0tiler Produce.. PotatoesThe Estimates as regards the stocks of potatoes available for food, after deducting seed, vary widely.     Lr. Lliddleton, of the Pood Production Department, estimates that the supply on Larch 1st. was from 280 to 300,000 tons.-   I.&apos;*r. Dennis, the Potato Controller, considers, on the other hand, that the supply is not more than 150,000 tons (120,000 tons 30,000 for Army Canteens).Hr. Dennis puts the supply&apos;at equal to about 3 weeks of y/hat he considers to be the average consumption.     The actual consumption per week is, however, very much less-- owing to the. present scarcity and price.RiceThe imports of rice in 1915 and 1916 have been large, viz., 9,993,039 cuts,  in 1915, 8,659,722 cuts, in 1916, as compared with 5,417,619 cwts. in 1914.Stocks of rice in Port Granaries and Lillers1 hands in the United Kingdom on January 1st. February 1st. Harch 1st, 1917 were as followsJanuary 1. 1,820^000 cuts,February 1. 2,240,000 cuts,i. arch; 1. 1,880,000 cuts.SugarThe fcllouing statement -shows stocks for 4 weeks ending Larch 10th :-1917 1916 1915   -Tons Tons Tons17th.February 617H2        &quot;46.647 43o79^024th.February 5R.244 52.583 443.0365rd.Larch ^  .127        &quot;59.086 427,4/110th.Larch 59.851        &apos; 51.005 428.702
iiccording to present estimates and assuming no less of ships, supplies nill fall to  5,500 tons in the middle of April, rising to 63,421 tons by the end of April. .The weekly amount released for consumption is 22,400 tons so that in the middle of April the stock in hand will be little over one week&apos;s supply.     At present the confectionery, jam, biscuit and mineral water trades are taking 6^200 tons per v/eek - being approximately 60% of their pre-war consumption.^ a 1^7       ducenormally,  (1910-1914) the United Kingdom produces 25.l/  of the supplies of butter and margarine, 19.5.   of its cheese,&quot; and 95,4.,   of its milk supply.     The only basis of evidence as to supplies is the number of milch cows.     The number of milch cows snows a small reduction in 1916, being 4,034,332, as compared frith 4,068,957 in 1915, and 4,144,937 in 1914.As regards imports, the following statement shows the imports 1913 - 1916.

while imports of cheese amount to 464,000 Cwts. in 1917 as against 375,000 cwts. in 1916.The following table shows the stocks of Cheese, butter, eggs, margarine, lard and condensed milk at ports, in cold stores and in Importers1 Vvarehouses on the .ljst, March, 1916and the 1st March, 1917:- (in tons).March 1, 1916 March 1, IS17Cheese. 8,600 5*300Butter. 18,800 7,600Eggs. 1,500 1,500Margarine. 5,700 4,100Bard. 7,500 3,500^Condensed Milk 5,300 5,500In manufacturers1 hands.   Includes both home and imported produce.II, Ibices.The Board of Trade estimate that from July 1914 to March 1917 the increase da the cost of all the items ordinarily entering into working class family expenditure, including food, rent, clothing, fuel and light, may be estimated at In other words, 20/- has only a purchasingpower equal to 12/s in 1914.     The rise in the prices of food has been considerably greater than the rise in the general cost of living.     Up to February 1, 1917, the rise in the level of prices of food was returned by the Board of Trade at 9 $.     The price of the 4-lb. loaf has risen from 5-^d. in July 1914 tc 8d. in July 1915, 9d. in July 1916, and lid. in March 1917.     Thus in the most important article of consumption the rise has been exactly 100$.
The following&quot;table shows the changes in pride in chief articles of food :-AVERAGE PRICES, of &quot;ERINCIVAL ARTICLES of FOOD (Inly 1914 and March 1, 1917)July 1914      March 1, 1917     PercentageIncrease.Beef: (per lb.)

Ill;,Food Production,Reports received from the Board of Agriculture for England &amp;&apos;Wales and the Board of   Agriculture for Scotland indicate the following reported additional acreage under tillage :-England &amp; Wales,. 50,470 acres.Scotland 23,798 acres.In Ireland provision has &quot;been made by Order in Council recplring holders of ov?r 10 ceres to increase their tillaeo area in 1917 by 10$ - unless 50$ of the holding Is already tilled.     The Irish Department report that farmers are generally endeavouring to carry out the scheme, but weather conditions have been bad, and there is lack of machinery. A very considerable increase however, in the tillage area is anticipated.     In 1915, the first tillage jraar after the out-break of war, the tillage area increased by 76,000 acres, largely as a result of the campaign for increased food pro-duction in 1915..    This increased area was substantially main-tained - in 1916 - there being a slight falling- off of4,000 acres.An increase exceeding that of 1915 is new confidently expected.(Intld.) W.G.S.A
