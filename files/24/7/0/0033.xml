D/ES/2119 th ITatrch 1917.0 T   in SUIB1ARY 0? BLOCKADE INFOR]    ;T0ITb. 1./** JsJ /r&quot;--------------&quot; v^^^^SvF      &apos; March 2 - March 8. $BALI 6J5TJ1MABIN3 BL00KX.DE. Sinkings reported March 2-8:-British Steamers........ 52,187 tons gross.(over 500 tons gross)British Sailing Ships ... (over 100 tons gross)865lleutral Steamers    ....... 23,520     &quot;       &quot;(over 500 tons gross)Neutral Sailing Shins ...   4.409     &quot; (over 100 tons gross)81,081 tons gross.Norwegian owners are taking heart.   Between Feb. 18 and March 4. sailings of 17 shins from Feet Norwegian aorta took olace, apparently without casualties. The Norwegian Shin-ewners Association has undertaken to put pressure oh owners y/ho keen their shins in nort- we have notified them of more than 50 shins which are lying idle.   Norwegian sailings to the United Kingdom will increase ran idly if our system of issuing coal-licences is improved, so as to ensure that every approved Norwegian shin receives a return cargo of coal without delay.    The Norwegians require 200,000 tons of British coal per month, which they can only obtain in exchange for-approved cargoes, ton for ton, landed in the United Kingdom.The conduct of other neutral owners is less satis-factory.   H.M, Government have sent a warning to Stock-holm, Conenha^en, The Hague and. Madrid that owners who make no use of nart of their shins will receive no further facilities in British norts for the remainder.
This inducement by itself will not be sufficient. In Denmark, Sweden and Spain, the question of insurance presents great difficulties. The Spanish Government is merely considering the advisability of a state insurance scheme. The Swedish State Insurance Commission charges prohibitive rates for cargoes to the United Kingdom, and will not insure timber. The Danish State Insurance Commission pleads inability to carry the risks of United Kingdom voyages. In Denmark the members of the Seamen&apos;s Union are largely out on strike; it is suspected that German influence, and possibly German money are behind the strike. With Denmark we have taken strong measures, since our agreed share of Danish produce is at stake. On Feb. 6. H.M. Government ordered the detention of all cargoes bound for Denmark until satisfactory arrangements should be made for bringing this produce to the United Kingdom in Danish vessels. The greater part of our share had already reached Bergen in six vessels of the Danish United Steamship Co. but these vessels would proceed no further, because the Germans have withdrawn the promise of a safe passage to Aberdeen. On learning of the action of H.M. Government the Danish Government out pressure on the United Steamship Co. who now agree that the six vessels may come forward, but only if insurance is provided for them.

The Dutch ship-owners are at present unwilling to arrange sailings, because the German Government have not yet named the date on which a safe passage to the north-about route will be open. This procras-
tin&amp;tion has ali-o had the effect of keeping Belgian relief shios in Dutch harbours.   The Ge;...,un 6ov-*n-ment pretend that tney are waiting for the return of certain submarines which have not yet been instructed to spare Butch ships.   For Dutch sailings to the [fail-ed Kingdom no effective safe-conduct is tt be ex:&apos;&apos;ect-ed; but Dutch owners are asking if we will give them convoy.   Sir Valter Tov.nley has replied that Dutch ships may attach themselves to convoyed ^arties if they olease; but H.X,Government will assume no reso^n-sibility.   i&apos;or the next few days Dutch shi-^s will receive no facilities from us, pending explanations by the Dutch Government of their conduct in warning away the 3;itish merchantman &quot;Princess Melita&quot; ire-m the do On. of Holland, on the ground that she was carry -ing a gun aft.    If this is against Dutch x.*w, the law must be altered.Our oc,.eme for requisitioning neutral tonnage bear fruit slowly, wo have almost arranged with cer-tain Danish owners the terms for requisitioning some Danish vessels, now in British ports, which are urgently required for military purposes; and we have anticipated the conscientious objections of the United 3taxes by explaining to Mr. .i?afe the grounds on which we consider that the step is justified.The Dutch and the Spanish Governments refuse to recognise the transfer of their vessels to the British Flag.   The Dutch Government state that Dutch law for-bids such a transfer, and that Holland is dependent on Germany for shipbuilding materials. Sir -VJardinge believes that Germany has promised to spare Spanish
shipping so long as it remains under the Spanish flag; but the Spanish Government base their refusal on the fear of adverse nublio opinion.Sweden has been threatened with Germany&apos;s dis-pleasure if a passage through the Kogrund Channel is afforded to the British shirs in the Baltic.    The threat has produced the desired efieet.   But Mr. Hamiaar.sIc.iold again suggests that the ships should be transferred to the Swedish flaff, and then chartered to us.     He has been asked to formulate a scheme.Te have an offer of 250,000 tons (deadweight) of American shi.o-.in-? now en-?a:?ed in coastal traffic.    The President of the Federal Shipping Board refuses his consent to the transaction;   but, with the help of the State Department which has been promised, he may be persuaded to change his mind.   Another 58,000 tons (Austrian shinning in TJ.S.A. ports) can probably be secured, for Allied trades, if we will recognise its transfer to the American Flag.The conference between the President of the Board of Trade and *r. elemental, which is still pro-ceeding In Paris, is expected to result in reciprocal rationing of irnoorts.     Thus we may have to permit 50, of our normal imports of French wine.    But both countries will extend their lists of restricted imnorts:    and on the balance it is expected that greater economies of tonnage will be made than the Board, of Trafe originally anticipated.
ii?Tp?A?T SUPPLIES.       A German trader writes to an American customer!, &quot;You have no idea how completely the English control &quot;overseas traffic to and from neutral countries.     All &quot;I can say is that, if the English knew how to organise &quot;everything as well as they have organised the so-called blockade of Germany, Germany would long ago &quot;have been crushed&quot;.The conclusion of an Anglo-Swedish Agreement would practically round off the blockade, so far as overseas supplies are concerned.     But the Swedish Government have not yet offered their-comments on the draft of this Agreement.     Minor possibilities of leak-acre are still being discovered at various-points and special agreements vith the neutrals concerned are being negotiated.     This week we have received the text of the new Jute Agreement with the Norwegian Government (dated Feb.12) and of a revised Agreement with the Dutch concerning Fides, Leather &amp; Tanning Materials. The revision of the Agreement with the Societe Buisse de Surveillance Economique is still a subject of negotia-tion at ]3erne.Until the end of June the food position in Germany will become progressively more critical;   after that date the Roumanian Harvest will produce sensible relief. The Germans have treated the Roumanian cultivators well and will no doubt secure a substantial quantity of bread-corn and fodder-corn out &amp;f the new harvest which is due in mid-June,     Meanwhile Germany is making strenuous efforts to obtain enlarged supplies of fish, meat and agricultural produce from the adjoining neutral countries.       Germany is accumulating stocks of cured fish in Norway, in addition to her recognised
oercentage of the aeaeont-3 eatch.    If the Norwegian Government cancel their Fish Agreement with us, as they might do at any time,  this cured fish would go at once to Germany   From Sweden the Germans are obtaining beef (in dwindling quantities), nork^md fish.   To some extent we can check this trade by keening Sweden ehort .)f fodder-stuffs, by refusing mineral oil to Swedish fhUhe risen, and by preventing Icelandic and Norwegian fish from reaching   wo den.    i&apos;he ex -orts of cattle, meat and produce from Denmark to Germany continue to be heavy If we cut off all su /plies of fodder-stuffs, it is eo-timated that the Dane;j will at once export about 14-million head of live-.it )ck to Germany.    But this live-stock mi gat be le.^ valuable t   Germany than the ore-sent steady supplies of Danish meat, bacon, butter,milk and eggs, and fatted cattle,   Germany has offered the D-oiish fisherm n 6, )00 tons of petroleum if she may take all the fish which they are allowed to export. The Danish Government have a;Jked no for counter-proposals.Our Agricultural Agreement with Holland receives a new lease of life from our ability to resume caoh oayraeiits; but unleoo we can so -ply the Dutch trawlers with coal we are likely to lose the benefits of our Fish Agreements.    The Germans are ready to find the necessary coal,- in exchange for half of tae fish v. hi eh are available for exoort.    Switzerland has not yet received the su-rplies of oil-cake which we must provide if the exoort of Swine cottie te Germany ij to be stoooed.    her trade returns for the fir^t nine months of 1916 ohow t ,at the supplies which she can send to Germany under -the ^,.S.S. Agreement are by no means in-
ITar Trade Intelligence Departmentconsiderable.      These exports include the following items:-Cocoa px Chocolate    ... loj million francs. Cattle    ............. 19Cheese, Milk &amp; Conden-sed Milk     ......... 28?-Alcohol, \Vine &amp; Per-mouth..............    5\Much of the wine exported by Switzerland is of Italian origin.     The Italian Government however now agree that wine shall be made consienable to the S S.S.    If the French lovernment will also a^ree to this step, it will be impossible to re-export wine from Switzerland.
