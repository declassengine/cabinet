DESTRUCTION OF GRAIN AND MACHINERY IN ROTJMAMIA.From Lieut.-Colonel J. Norton-Griffiths to Director of Military Intelligence,War Office, London.gjr Jassy, 27th January, 1917.I have the honour to forward my report on the destruction and evacuation of cereals in the Buzeu, Ramnic-Sarat, Braila and Focsani districts. It includes the work of evacuation and destruction carried out in the towns of Braila and Galatz.In my report on the destruction of oil, despatched to you on the 18th January, I mentioned that I found it necessary to direct my personal efforts to oil, and that I&apos; detailed Captain Pitts to carry on, in accordance with your instructions, the destruction of cereals.I attach Captain Pitts&apos; report,. which records the efforts made to carry out these instructions.The complete destruction of oil and corn being of paramount importance, and time being too short for both, I decided to turn all my efforts to the oil. which appeared to be of more vital importance to the enemy and required greater technical skill to accomplish.The work of oil required my personal and constant attention up to the 8th of December, when, having detailed Lieutenant Simpson to destroy the oil stocks and refineries at Buzau, I proceeded with the rest of the oil party to Braila, the then head-quarters of the Russian army in Southern Roumania, to pick up the corn question.On the 10th December I saw His Excellency General Sacharoff, the commander of the Russian troops, then occupying a front extending west from the Danube as far as the point of junction with the Roumanian front south-east of the latter point. The Roumanians &quot;were then fighting and retiring on the Mizil Buzau road. The Russians were bringing up reinforcements and extending their line towards the Roumanians as quick!)&apos; as possible. It may here be of interest to record that the Russian efforts to stem the enemy advance by forced marches were undertaken with great energy, but the difficulties of the meagre railway transport, the impossible state of the one main road, and the remaining mud tracks made it a most difficult movement, and, in the circum-stances, I doubt if we could have moved troops more quickly.General Sacharoff, at my request, detailed a Staff officer to accompany me, Captain Prince Cherbatoff, giving me and my party the necessary passes and also a general letter stating that the troops were to assist us whenever requested.I attach, in their order of work, the reports of Captains Pitts and Scale; Lieutenant Hay ward and Captain Masterson, whom I took out and placed at their various posts, as well as Captain Prince Bibesco&apos;s records which bear on the oil and the corn. These reports record the result of their efforts.My personal efforts were directed to what can best be described as raiding, in which Captain Prince Bibesco and Captain Prince Cherbatoff co-operated.RUSSIAN CO-OPERATION.Each divisional commander was visited, particularly the General Officer Commanding avalry divisions, on whom I mainly relied. In many cases small raiding parties were iganized, and, within a few days, along the whole Russian front in the Braila area, and. overlapping into the Buzau district, thev were destroying cereals wherever found in their retreat. I found everywhere the same feeling of relief; Russian commanders and their subordinates joyful at making what they termed &quot; war up to the hilt,&quot; enquiring why we had not come earlier, and regretting that they had received previous instructions not to destroy. ^ During this time I visited each of my officers and found their efforts were^ also meeting with success; they in turn were being assisted in their work by Lussian troops. In many cases Russian cavalry were. detailed to accompany one or other of my officers, and at various stations on the Faurei Braila line, fatigue parties01
of infantry, 100 200 strong, were provided to load trucks in the effort to evacuate as much as possible before destruction, which was always left to the last moment. The work at Ciora was personally directed by me. It is regretted that the Bulgarian troops, with a battery of guns, cut the line at Faurei, capturing some 28 wagons of corn which we had made efforts to save.The difficulty always facing us was to know where the front was. It was never stationary at this time for more than a day or so, and came back in steps as the result of actions fought in the vicinity of the main Ciora Braila road, and of the bigger enemy movements along the Mizil Buzau Ramnic-Sarat road. These latter governed the movements to the south-west until the Danube was reached.GRAIN ON BARGES NEAR SILISTRIA.During this period I made efforts to raid, through the enemy lines, Calarashi,  I opposite Silistria, where, according to the Russians, important stocks had been left in barges owing to the instructions, which appear to have been sent to the troops whilst retiring from the Brabocea River front, that all corn was to be left.   This effort failed, and the small mounted party narrowly escaped capture.During this period, dating from the 10th of December, it can be safely stated that all stacks of fodder with which the country was dotted, and cereals of all kinds in the areas mentioned, were set alight&apos; and destroyed. My movements were naturally rapid, but wherever one or two of my party were not personally directing the work the tell-tale streaks of smoke could be seen, so that whatever existed in this line not recorded below, and included in one or other of the attached reports, was destroyed.-ROUMANIAN OPPOSITION.This work proceeded merrily until the 16th/17th December, when I learnt from the General Officer Commanding 38th Russian Division that General Sacharoff had issued instructions to cease co-operating in the work of destruction. These instructions culminated at one point in an order to us not to destroy, and that no destruction would be permitted. To this I replied that I should continue to carry out the instructions of the British War Office. I at once proceeded to the Russian Headquarters, and saw His Excellency, General Sacharoff, to enquire the reasons of this sudden change in his original instructions. He replied that he regretted having to do so, but that it was under pressure of the B,oumanian Government; that, while he would not interfere with my carrying out the instructions of the British War Office, he could not, in the circumstances, assist. In vain I pointed out that he was responsible for the Prussian sphere of activity, and on behalf of the British War Council and the War Office I demanded his support. I supported my urgent requests with all possible arguments. All I secured was his good will. In this I wired to Sir G. Barclay and also to yourself, pointing out that if you wished the co-operation of the Russians to continue, it would be necessary to bring the necessary pressure to bear through Petrograd.In spite of this disappointing Russian order I think General SacharofFs instructions to discontinue were only issued half-heartedly, for unquestionably his sympathies were with us in our work. I found that many outlying brigades and divisions had not received any cancellation of their orders, so I continued to obtain the help of the Russian troops by using my original letter, which in fact had been cancelled. Where a Russian general officer commanding had received cancelling instructions we still had the assistance of their troops on giving a promise that &quot;we did it ourselves.&quot; In the Vizirul area the Russian co-operation became so zealous, that Roumanian officials tele-graphed to the Roumanian Government Commissioner, and it was mainly due to this that the Roumanian Government brought pressure to bear on General Sacharoff to cease destruction.Instructions to stop were also issued to me by the Roumanian Government through their Royal Commissioner ; these instructions were mislaid, and I did not receive them until the work in hand had been completed. It was always difficult for any instructions to reach me as my movements, rapid as they had to be, were restricted to the front line, wherever it happened to be.At one point Lieutenants Tamplm and Hayward, who were working together, met me near Focsani and reported that General Polovtzeff of the 7th Division had ordered them to cease destruction, saying that he would under no circumstances permit it. I gave them written instructions in the name of the British War Office to return and carry on their work, which was done.
194z.z The work covered a wide field and included the evacuation of rolling stock as well as destruction. Much rolling stock would have fallen into enemy hands had we not pretended to be acting for the Roumanian General Staff in issuing directions to local station-masters. At this time the single line was blocked with evacuated rolling-stock train after train, engines coupled up to one another, some cold, and all being &quot;pushed along.&quot; The enemy was meantime endeavouring to intercept the movement - there were two cases of engine-drivers purposely derailing their engines and disappearing and in one case enabling the enemy to cut off the loaded waggons of grain referred to earlier in this report.SlatinaClOARAmuftiuUrleasca-Station Urleasc a-Vi LLAGE JancaGlTGESTIcotesti       .....FoCfcSANI      .....Putna-SeacaGi URGENT.....FlLIU .....TlllLELE      .....IjOBDEI-VeRDE LlSCOTEANCABagdadDeduxesti.....BlLlPESTI     .....SUTESTImovjla MlEESEI   ..Serboi       .....SlJROAIA     .....Pricistan.....GEAIN MOVED OR DESTROYED.Five private stores burnt by British Bureau Staff.Loaded 158 tons in carts and delivered to Roumanian Army Supply at Braila (146 B.B.).

About 3,500 tons destroyed by Russians at our request. 2,740 tons destroyed.   350 tons destroyed by Russians at our request.500 tons destroyed by Russians at our request. 1,150 tons&apos;destroyed.In addition to the above there was much, as I have stated, destroyed by Russian troops in the manner described, which is not recorded, as we have no means of checking their individual work. How much of it was done by enemy shell-fire I am not in a position to state, but I have no doubt that a good deal of damage was caused in this way.We, like the Russian troops, were eventually driven back on Braila, clearing the stations on the Faurei-Janca line to Braila.EVACUATION OF BRAILA.I found that the Ministry of Munitions, under French direction, had issued instructions to evacuate all useful machinery at Braila and Galatz, no. doubt the outcome of Sir George Barclays efforts at Government Headquarters, and the efforts of Lieutenant Phillipon, who had promised me to press the matter through General Berthelot.Our efforts at Braila, therefore, can be summarized as facilitating the work oi evacuation thus ordered, and at the last moment destroying anything which might be of &quot;-&quot;&quot;&quot;nance to the enemy, such a^ lathes and other workshop machinery; pressing for the
evacuation of all river craft and seeing that it was evacuated, m which we had the effective co-operation of the Roumanian Danube Naval Authorities; arranging for the destruction of the wharf and dock derricks, cranes and other useful plant. Our work was made easy here by the able efforts of Captain Pitts, who, although suffering from a recent operation, stuck to his job in a praiseworthy manner.To secure government sanction to the removal and destruction of the cellulose works at Braila, it was necessary to obtain once more the co-operation of the British Minister. Upon receipt of my telegram he secured without delay the necessary authority. We loaded about 3,000 tons into barges, and about 300 tons on to trucks; the rest was completely burnt. These works were owned by &quot;Fabrica de Celuloza Societe Anonyme, Braiia.&quot; The management had been shipping quantities of this material, used in the manufacture of gvm-cotton to the enemy via the Danube. The Russian Commander of the 4th Siberian Corps, then at Braila, gave me his destruction train on condition that we took all responsibility, and from midnight of the 31st December/lst January to mid-day of the 1st of January we commenced the work of total destruction of these works by dynamite, and also of the adjoining cement works owned by Prince Cantacuzene.EVACUATION OF GALATZ,In the meantime I had despatched Captain Pitts to make a reconnaissance of Galatz. On ray arrival there on the 1st January, I found that Colonel Thomson had already given written instructions to evacuate or destroy various works and material which Captain Pitts had recorded to a Roumanian Engineer Officer named Enesco, sent there by order of the Director of Munitions. I attach a copy of these instructions to this report (see page 15). I have personally always refrained from giving any written instructions. For example, the Ministry of Munitions, under French direction, had already issued evacuation instructions for Braila and Galatz, and I wished to avoid more liability than was necessary.The assistance of the armoured car unit at Galatz is dealt with by Captain Pitts iu his report. Their co-operation was of great value in dismounting or destroying-machinery. Indeed this small detachment of one officer and 28 men did more in a day than 10 times the number of local labourers.EVACUATION OF FOCSANI.From Galatz we next turned our attention to the front, then beino; driven in. in the vicinity of Focsani Marasesti, where the Russian and Roumanian forces joined, making our base at Tecuci. The position here in the first week of January was critical, the front being drawn in to within 5 kilometres of Marasesti station. Focsani had to be given up in consequence of this pressure.We left nothing of value in the latter place.At Marasesti a great congestion of rolling stock had taken place, much of it with cellulose and other stores which we had loaded at Braila and Galatz.I gave the railway station authorities notice that I should destroy all rolling stock which had.not been evacuated from Marasesti Junction by 6 p.m. the following evening. Under the able direction of the station inspector, A.nton Gheorghin, whom I afterwards reported, and who, I understand from General Presau, has since been decorated and promoted, some 1,200 wagons were evacuated, and beyond shunting at great speed some 20 trucks into the wrecked remains of a bridge over the Sushitza river with a view to causing further obstacles to the enemy, the whole of the rolling stock was saved, including some 20 odd trucks of ammunition evacuated from the ammunition works at Galatz. Urgent telegrams to the Director-General of Railways, M. Cottescu, unblocked the stations which had hitherto prevented the despatch of these wagons.Much general work of destruction was carried out in this region. Captain Masterson&apos;s attached report deals with the largest saw-mill plant in the country, its stacks of timber, amounting to about one million and a-half cubic feet, and its chemical works.The Russians, however, had already commenced most of this work, and we only encouraged and assisted them in their efforts, as the General Officer Commanding 4th Army Corps was most anxious to have the co-operation of the British.I think I have outlined the general nature of our work since it was possible to devote my full attention to it.
195RECOMMENDATIONS.I should like to mention the following officers in connection with the work mentioned in this report :-Captain Pitts, responsible for the organization of the British Bureau. I have been materially aided by this officers complete records of the corn areas and their stocks, and his co-operation, together with that of his experienced staff, has been invaluable to the mission &quot;in its work ; and this notwithstanding the fact that he had not recovered from a serious operation.   I cannot speak too highly of this officers excellent work.Captain Prince Cherbatoff, for his efficient assistance in obtaining the help of the Russian troops and generally helping the mission in their work.The following officers, already mentioned in connection with the work on the oil, maintained the same high standard of efficiency : Captain Scale. Captain Masterson. Lieutenant Hay ward. 2nd Lieutenant Tamplin. Captain Prince Bibesco.2nd Lieutenant Tamplin, who only arrived in time to take part in the work on corn, has been noticeable for his zeal and energy, and I desire to draw your attention to the high intelligence this young officer possesses. With his perfect knowledge of Russian, which he reads and writes, he was of great value to the mission while working in the Russian sphere.Even if the armies were to withdraw from the Sereth line to the Russian frontier, the work of the Mission, and the influence brought to bear on the various authorities to remove grain in time, will have bereft the enemy of any chances of gain that might have been his.The Commander of the Russian troops in R-oumania, General Sacharoff, having at last received instructions to destroy whatever corn or other things of value in the event of any further retreat being likely, the work of the &quot;Mission has come to an end, after having accomplished, in as far as it could, the work which it set out to accomplish.I trust that the work of the Mission will meet with your approval.It only remains for me to add that the following officers have returned to their original duties : Captain Scale to Petrograd.Captain Trelawney to London via Petrograd.Lieutenants Tamplin and Hay ward remain watching the Bacau oilfields, where everything is in readiness for immediate destruction. Captain Masterson is compiling records. Captain Pitts remains at the head of the British Bureau.Captain Bibesco also has been detailed by. General Presan, at my request, to watch the Bacau oilfields, for the destruction of which the Russian IXth Army had detailed a special sapper unit.I have, &amp;c,J.

NORTON-GRIFFITHS, Lieut-Colonel.Enclosure No. 1.REPORT BY CAPTAIN PITTS.Jassy, 17th January, 1917.Ou the 18th November, Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths informed me that he had arrived in Bucarest, entrusted by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the mission of preventing any grain in Roumania from falling into enemy hands.The position then was, as follows : The British Bureau had brought about 430,000 tons of wheat which was stored at stations all along the railway lines and at farms scattered all over the country.Of this quantity about 100,000 tons had been given over to the Roumanian Army under an arrangement made in August, 1916, between the British Bureau and the Roumanian Government whereby the latter had been authorized to take for the use of the Roumanian Army such quantities of British bought wheat as they required in exchange for an equal quantity of new wheat to be returned to the British Bureau at a later period. This arrangement proved of great advantage to both parties, as it enabled the Roumanian Government,&apos; when transport was extremely difficult owing to mobilization, to find stocks of wheat at convenient places which did not involve any immediate outlay of cash, and saved the British Bureau the loss it would have incurred otherwise through the natural deterioration of the wheat. As it proved, the advantage to the British Bureau was even greater, as the amount of wheat lent to the Roumanian Government was saved from destruction or capture during the German invasion.I informed Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths that the services of the staff of the British Bureau and my own were at his disposal for the accomplishment of his mission, but that the difficulties before us were enormous.The only means of destroying the wheat was by fire as, owing to the lack of transport, it was impossible to damage it effectively by saturating it with petroleum.The Roumanian Government emphatically opposed all destruction and later, when under pressure from His Majesty&apos;s Ministers and the Allied Ministers, they agreed to the destruction of British wheat, they expressly forbade the firing of granges or farms, extended no help, and in fact placed obstacles in the way of any destruction.The staff of the British Bureau as civilians could not perform acts of war against the expressed orders of the Roumanian authorities. Labour, motor-cars, carts and horses, being all requisitioned, were unobtainable.The. only available means of transport was a congested line, with one train running daily in each direction and it would have necessitated an army of men and several months to accomplish a task which owing to the military situation, required the promptest possible action.Nevertheless, an attempt was made to burn the corn in the district near Slatina, and on the 24th November three parties of British Bureau employees left Bucarest in motor-cars, kindly lent by Captain Prince Bibesco and Lieutenant Chrissoveloni, who also volunteered their services. On arrival at Pitesti the General Officer Commanding the Army would only authorize the destruction of British corn, and that on condition that the warehouses and stores were not destroyed. Notwithstanding this order, one party succeeded in reaching Slatina and burnt five private stores containing about 2,000 tons of corn. As it was impossible to do any further work the parties returned to Bucarest.On the 26th November, three clerks of the British Bureau were sent on the Bucarest Ploesti line with instructions to burn grain stored in farms on the way. As, however, they could obtain no assistance from the&quot; Authorities, nor even means of transport from the railway stations to the farms, they did absolutely nothing.
These attempts proved that any destruction on a large scale was utterly impossible without a military organization. ^ &quot;On the 2nd December I received at Jassy, a message froni Lieut.-Colonel JNorton-Griffiths informing me that I had been appointed a Captain in the British Army, and ordering me to report to him at Ploesti, where he was engaged with the destruction ofthe oil-fields. . &apos;On the 7th December I was ordered, with Captain Scales and the British members of the British Bureau Staff to proceed to Braila, in order to organize the evacuation or destruction of the grain in the districts lying between Buzeu, R-Sarat, Focsani and Braila, which would be threatened next by the enemy.The wide and sweeping movements of the enemy, which were as unexpected as they were rapid, necessitated the abandonment of large tracks of country without resistance, and made it impossible to destroy the grain in a great part of the most fertile region.The position then had changed : Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths had under his orders a small force of British officers, who could move more freely than civilians in military regions, 6 motor-cars which arrived eventually from Odessa, and several carts and horses which were bought at Ploesti. These enabled the officers to move about the country, though the indescribable state of the roads rendered movement extremely difficult.The region in which we had to operate was occupied by Russian troops; their commanders had not the same views about the destruction of grain as the Roumanian Government, and, for the first few days, they helped when necessary in the work of destruction. Their co-operation, however, was brought to a prompt end by an order, issued by the Russian Commander-in-Chief, and doubtless under pressure from the Roumanian Government, to the effect that no privately-owned grain was to be destroyed. This was confirmed by a telegram from the Royal Roumanian Commissioner to the 6th Russian Army, stating that the Government would only consent to the destruction of oilfields and British-owned corn, and that all other material, factories, mills, fodder and foodstuffs must not be destroyed. All the work, therefore, had to be done entirely by the unaided and personal efforts of the small British contingent in the face of very considerable difficulties, and against the express orders of the civil and military authorities. Advantage was taken when all civilians had evacuated and the zone left to military commanders, who could not control or watch our movements owing to their attention being fully occupied in other directions.At Braila our efforts were first directed to the transport of grain from the outlying districts to Braila, Galatz, and other towns where corn was urgently needed for the wants of the army and the population.It may be as well to correct here the belief which appears to be prevalent at home that the grain in Roumania was mostly centralized in large towns. As transport had been almost impossible to obtain since the 28th August, when Roumania mobilized, all the grain was scattered throughout the countryside and in farms often inaccessible at this time of the year except on horseback. All the big centres were denuded of grain, the increasing needs of the Roumanian and Russian armies and of the local population having exhausted the stocks which had been stored there before the outbreak of war.The work of evacuation was carried out in the face of great difficulties as it was generally impossible to obtain trucks or to have them moved on the line when once they had been loaded. Thus 28 trucks loaded with wheat at Cicara never reached their destination, having apparently been intercepted by the enemy further down the line.Appeals were made to the Prefects, Mayors, and the Roumanian and Russian military authorities for carts and labour in order to help in the transport of grain to safe centres, but very few carts and men could be spared for this work as they were mostly required for other military purposes.In all, we succeeded in transporting about 2,100 tons, as will be seen from the detailed statement attached. The grain thus saved was delivered, whenever possible, to the Prefects or Mayors, and receipts obtained. -About 25,000 tons which could not be transported in time were destroyed by fire. These quantities can be vouched for by us.It can be stated, however, that with the co-operation of the Russians all corn and other cereals stored in these districts, with the exception of small quantities held by ueasants, were effectually destroyed.With reference to telegram No. CX 154 from the Director of Military Intelligence *o Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths, only a very few stocks of grain had been destroyed by Roumanians before the retreat and no stocks which affect British compensation.   Live-
stock had been generally driven off, but no reliable information on that point is obtainable at present. It is reported that the Russian army burnt great quantities of grain during its retreat from the South of. Bucarest to Braila, but details are unobtainable.&apos;The quantity of British bought corn now existing in Moldavia is 37,000 tons. I estimate that about 143,000 tons have been taken over by the Roumanian Army, so that about 180,000 tons have been saved.Oorr of Telegram from the Roumanian Royal Commissioner tu the 6th Russian AumtREPEATED to captain PlTTS.(Handed in at Tuleea.) 21st December, 1910.No. 117. Received reply. Noted and approved as regards petroleum industries and British corn, but as regards other material, factories, mills, corn, forage, foodstuffs, quite impossible.The Roumanian Government Commissioner.(Repeated to Tecuci and Barlad.)On my arrival at Braila, on the 8th December, I made enquiries as to the quantity of corn stored in the warehouses in the town.I found that all stocks had been depleted, and that there was no corn whatever with the exception of small quantities held by millers for the immediate needs of the army and population.Both the Prefect and the Mayor were very much concerned about the shortage of grain, and urgently appealed to me that, if we succeeded in moving any of the stocks from the surrounding districts, we should send at least part of it to Braila, saying that there would be no danger of its falling into enemy hands, as it would be rapidly consumed before the town was really threatened, the enemy being at that time about 60 kilometres distant. I requested them to provide me with carts and labour, but, despite their utmost efforts to provide them, they found it impossible to do so. It was with great difficulty that I obtained a convoy of 600 carts and 1,200 men from the Roumanian Officer Commanding the Lines of Communication and sent them to load grain at Cioara, which was then within the zone immediately threatened.The convoy was bombed by enemy aeroplanes on its return, losing six men and 12 horses, but succeeded in bringing to Braila about 158 tons of corn. The horses were iinfit for a return journey, and as no other carts were obtainable we had to rely on loading empty trucks on the Faurei Braila railway line.In all we succeeded in moving into Braila about 625 tons of corn, which was certainly consumed before the enemy arrived as the town was not evacuated until the 4th Januarv.The prices of cereals established by the Roumanian Government in 1916 were as follows : (a.) Export prices  per 100 kilos.Wheat or Rye...      ...      ...      ...      ... ... 32 leiBarley ...       ............... ... 27 ,,Brewing barley        ...      ...      ...      ... ... 45 ,,Oats    ....       ...       ......,       ...       ... ... 2.6Maize (red, pignoletto or cinquantino)        ... .... 30 ,,Maize (ordinary)       .......       ...       ... ... 28 ,,(b.)

of Colonel Stejens of the French Army and of Captain the Marquis du Belloy of the French Navy. All machinery, engines, stocks and material were being shipped, partly into barges for removal to Eussia, and partly loaded on railway trucks for transport to Jassy or Uugheni. The work was well in hand but there was a shortage of labour and, at the reqvest of the Boumanian and French officers in charge, I asked the Eussian Commander to send a party of 200 men with an officer, which he did immediately.I next visited the Star Milling Company (Moara Steaua); the Boumanian Officer in charge, Lieutenant Stefanescu, informed me that he had no orders about evacuation. The stocks in the mill were 800 tons flour, which would be consumed by the population in 10 days, 240 tons of flour for the Army, which was being sent to Maresesti, and 750 tons of bran, which he had orders to load on railway trucks as soon as any were obtainable. He had also about 300,000 bags, of which he placed 60,000 at the disposal of the Russian Commander at the request of Colonel C. B. Thomson.In accordance with the wishes of Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths, Acting Commander Gregory, R.N., commanding the British Armoured Car Division, attached to the 6th Prussian Army, gave me a party of 1 officer and 28 men to assist in the destruction of such factories as were of military importance. Their co-operation was indispensable. We visited, in company with a Roumanian officer, the Westphalia Nail and Wire Factory and found that the work of evacuation was in full progress, and that no destruction would be necessary.Arrangements were made for the evacuation of the nail factory of Mustad Fii.On the 31st December we destroyed by sledge hammers the factory Albina (Fischer), where tin cases are made, and the Roumanian officer made arrangements for the evacuation of the stocks. We also gave orders for the nail and wire factory Ausschnitt to be destroyed by a party of Russian soldiers.On the 1st January, 1917, we destroyed the factory Greerul, another factory for tin cases. Two lathes, a dynamo and the easily removable material were handed to the Roumanians for evacuation by barge.We removed all the brass and copper fittings from the weaving factory Navodul and destroyed the steam engine.We ordered the destruction by Russian soldiers of such machinery of the Wolff wire and nails factory as could not be evacuated.We visited the Etna Oil Refinery and found that the work of evacuation was in progress.On the evening of the 1st January, Captain Scale arrived.Jassy,January, 1917.J.

They all worked very hard under very difficult conditions, aud in appreciating their services, the fact should be remembered, that although they did clerical work all their lives, they were called upon at a moments notice to perform what was practically soldiers&apos; work, often necessitating day and night work, and even manual labour.Names-I have, &amp;c,J  PITTS, Captain.Albert Hartley.

Enclosure No. 2. REPORT BY CAPTAIN SCALE, GENERAL STAFF.Braila, 22nd December, 1916.The district we have an intimate knowledge of from personal inspection is enclosed by a line drawn around the following places: Giurgeni, Film, Batogu, Filipesti, Sutesti, Racovita, Movila-Miresei and Bordei-Verde. This area contained 24,000 tons of grain of which we have destroyed 3,420 tons in different places on the front line. From Janca 600 tons have been railed back to Braila and further north. There still remains approximately 20,000 tons, the majority of which is off the railway (there are only 4,500 tons on railway line) where very few carts are available and even if available in large numbers the removable of this grain would take months, as the roads are almost impassable in places. -For example horse transport could only make the trip from Braila to Sutesti (where there are 5,000 tons grain) and back 3 or 4 times in a month.The grain stores along the railway line are insignificant compared with the supplies scattered in the district, but even for these stores the Grand Quartier General at present refuse to furnish wagons.The Russian Military Authorities have orders not to destroy grain, and will not assist us in its destruction.   We can only destroy insignificant quantities by ourselves.I can only see one chance of getting destruction permitted, and that is to approach the King on&quot;the subject and ask him to appeal to the patriotic instincts of landlords and farmers owning over 100 tons of stored grain, to agree to its destruction. As far as the peasants are concerned, their is no likelihood of their starving if these stores are burnt, as we have made enquiries in many villages from mayors who have always said that each house has its own secret store sufficient for its needs for a year.P.S. Since writing the above I have met Colonel Rumont, Belgian Attache, who in conversation, informed me that a General of the 40th Russian Division had told him that the English mission were desirous of destroying grain stores, and that the Russian authorities not only would not assist in this work but could not allow it.From Captain Scale (Braila) to Lieut-Colonel NOrton-GriJfiths (Barlad).No. 136. 0\\nng to recent instructions received from General Headquarters, Russian and Roumanian authorities refuse assistance for destruction. Without this assistance impossible destroy at last moment large stocks of grain in vicinity of front line in Braila district. Transport being impossible, want authority to destroy forthwith all stores grain in belt 15 kilometres deep behind Russian front line.Jassy, 17th January, 1917.Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths proceeded to Galatz on the 27th December and left me in charge of the arrangements for the destruction of factories, &amp;c, at Braila. Captain Prince Bibesco took over the work of evacuating the mill machine^. This he did with great success, and by 1st January the important parts of all mill engines had been loaded on barges and evacuated, with the exception of the Mill Romaneasca which had been left untouched-, by order of the Government, for the needs of the population. The boilers of all other mills were also rendered useless by overheating (i.e., firing without water).The arrangements for evacuating and destroying the cellulose factory, cement factory and rice factory, with one or two small works where shells were being manufactured, were under my immediate charge. There was also a very. large number of bags at Braila, well over a million, a larsze number of these were evacuated in barges. I handed over a large number to the Russian 6th Army Staff who were in great need of them for the trenches, and obtained bonds ; other were burnt, so that, on the German occupation, none, or an insignificant number remained.The cellulose factory &quot; Fabrica de Celuloza &quot; Societe Anonyme Braila had a large store of cellulose in wooden sheds round the factory itself. &apos; The total amount was stated
FACTORIES IN GALATZ AND THE STEPS TAKEN TO RENDER THEM USELESS IN CASE OF OCCUPATION BY THE ENEMY.Galatz, 4th January, 1917.All factories which could be utilized by the enemy have been evacuated, and in cases where total evacuation was impossible, instructions as to the demolition of the remaining machines have been left with an officer of the Armoured Car Detachment, who has been detailed by Commander Gregory to remain at Galatz till the last moment, and work with the Russian Demolition Detachment. This officer has, with Captain Pitts and myself, visited all factories, and know their position and the steps to be taken to vender them useless, and will personally accompany the Russian officer in,charge of the demolition. -The evacuation of the large factories has been carried out under the orders of a special Commission, and we have, therefore, only had to consider the destruction of- machines which could not be evacuated, and the evacuation of a large amount of copper, piping and lead plates which we found in the candle and soap factory of Konzelmann.This has all been removed and loaded by the Armoured Car Detachment, whose help: has been i nvaluablebv the Director to be 6,000 tons. During the 25th, 29th, 30th and 31st December, about half the amount was loaded on barges which were evacuated, and a-train of some 30 wao-ons was also despatched. The work of loading was difficult as the trolley lines from the factory to the river bank were old and soon got out of repair. Work was also impeded by the fact that only one Russian officer could be detailed for the fatigue party of 100 men. Many places needed the undivided attention of an officer. A party of 100 German, Austrian and Turkish prisoners were also at work without any officer in charge and a guard of only four Russian privates. The Russian staff were very anxious to save as much cellulose as possible, so that arrangements for demolition were put off as long as possible.On the 30th December I saw General Veranowsky, Chief of the Staff of the 6th Russian Army, and arranged through him for the detachment of the Railway Battalion, attached to the Army, to proceed with us over the factories, preliminary to destroying them. All was ready by the 31st December. Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths returned on the afternoon of that day. That night the cellulose remaining unevacuated was burnt and completely destroyed. The factory including all engines and retorts (14 of which could have been utilized at once for the manufacture of asphixiating gases) were destroyed by dynamite, and the factory itself fired. The place was completely wrecked. A large quantity of lead and copper piping was also evacuated from this factory with the cellulose. The factory appears to have belonged to an Austrian or German-owned firm. Cheques takem from the bureau of management are attached.   (Not received.)Cement factory. After the cellulose factory had been destroyed the cement factory was djmamited by the Russian detachment, under the instructions of Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths. One barge of cement and empty sacks was evacuated, and the remaining cement was spoiled by being scattered over the ground, the casks broken and the bags burnt.   This factory was also completely wrecked.The rice mill.- The Russian detachment proceeded there and destroyed the engine.   A store of flour was offered to the mayor for the use of the population.The two shops where shells were being manufactured were, with the help of the Russian detachment, wrecked and the machinery broken up.The engine and cranes at the docks were left to the tender mercies of the Russian detachment, who, while with us, carried out their work most thoroughly.Prince Bibesco was invaluable in arranging for barges, &amp;c, and worked with great energy, as did everyone who was under his orders.Though I have heard remarks made to the effect that the destruction of the cellulose factory was carried out earlier than was necessary, the Russian Command were so uncertain of the situation in the immediate future that they were in accord with Lieut.-Colonel Norton-Griffiths as to the necessity for its destruction on the night of the 31st December/lst January. . Further evacuation was also impossible as barges were unobtainable.
The following is a list of the factories evacuated and destroyed : -Fernic shipbuilding yard ...       ... Evacuated, engine to be blown up.Naval arsenal       ...      ...      ... ,, ,, ,,Titan iron works   ...      &apos;...... Destroyed.Westfalia iron works      ...      ... Evacuated.Grunberg ......

Brass evacu-ated.Watson   &amp;   Youell    agricultural Destroyed, machines.Two small boot factories ...      ... To be destroyed or evacuated.Dinnermann Vegetable Oil Distillery and Steaua Flour Mill have orders from War Minister to continue working, even in case of occupation by enemy. The former has large press which it has been ordered to evacuate, consider engines should be destroyed. The Steaua Mill is the only mill for five districts of Moldavia, as such is indispensable to population. The manager is a Croat and a Roumanian subject, but avowedly a German, and I have reported him as a case of removal before occupation by enemy.Docks and cranes also to be destroyed by the Russian Demolition Detachment.All barges are being removed down stream under the orders of Captain le Maruis du Belloy.We left Galatz yesterday at 11 a.m. after I had seen General Elchaninof, who is appointed to command the Galatz garrison. The 6th Army Staff has moved towards Belgrade, and the 4th Siberian Corps was leaving Galatz for some town further East when I left. Lieutenant Lefroy and six men with a lorry are waiting at Galatz under garrison commanders orders to destroy the remaining engines with the help of the Russian Demolition Detachment. We arrived here at noon as our cars broke down on the road, and we had to continue the journey by train. The Overland arrived this morning, but the Oppel is hors de combat and could not be tugged, nor could we get oxen. We have arranged with the railway authorities to load it on a truck (it is at the station at Vames) and despatched it to Barlad. To-day I visited General Ragusa commanding the 4th Army, and while I was there he gave orders for the destruction at daybreak to-morrow of the Faurei factory near Focsani, and of the powder factory at Marasesti (he has dynamite although he has no demolition train). As regards the position on the front, General Ragusa said they would be lucky if they held Focsani another two days. The general plan was to retire first to. the line of the Putna and then to the Siret. I also saw Colonel Zdor, the Army Engineer, who, with reference to the sugar factory at Sascut, thinks, as it is in the zone of the Roumanian 2nd Army, it is more difficult than if it was in the Russian zone, but a wire to the Chief of the Roumanian Communications, a Russian officer whose telegraphic address is Nach-vosorum, asking for demolition train No. 1 to be sent there (it is at his disposal) would probably be successful, and a wire recommending the demolition of the factory might also be sent to Lieut.-Colonel Smalof, as he is the Russian Attache with General Averesco.I am sending you this report in case.you intend going on to Bacau direct in car we are sending.General Elchaninof, on my report on German director of Flour Mill at Galatz, said he would have him interned and evacuated.J. SCALE, Captain,General Staff.
&apos;  (Translation.)From Commandant Cholesky, Technical Director of the Geographical Service at Jassy, to Lieut.-ColonelNorton-Griffiths.Galatz,21st December, 1916.  -Srd January, 1917.Following the visit which I made yesterday to the factories Max Fischer and Greerul, I presume that the lithographical workshops must not be left in their present condition. In the Max Fischer factory notably there exists a complete instillation of which the machinery, after rapid transformation, would be capable of furnishing maps and plans for several arms.It appears to me therefore advisable that the proprietors should be obliged either to dismantle the plants and load them on barges or put the machinery out of working order.I have the honour to beg that you will be good enough to study what you think I should do.C. NOLTJK.(Copy.)From Colonel C. B. Thomson, Military Attache, to Captain Engineer Enesco, of the Roumanian Naiy.17th to 30th December, 1916.As regards the evacuation of the nail and vegetable oil factories at Galatz, the following measures are absolutely necessary and should be undertaken at once : Westfama, which is already partly dismantled and evacuated, must be completely evacuated withthe least possible delay. Ausschnitt. The machinery in this factory must be completely destroyed at once. Mustard F. 11. The machinery and stock already packed must be loaded on a barge with the leastpossible delay, as well as all machinery remaining in the factory. Wolff. The dynamos and the motors must be at once loaded,on a barge, and the machinery formaking the nails and wire must be immediately destroyed. Etna. The steam engine must be immediately destroyed, and the presses which remain must be loaded&apos;on a barge if possible.Dinnermann.-Preparatory measures for eventual destruction must be begun at once. .1Moisio Refinery. Preparatory measures for eventual destruction to be undertaken at once.Fernic. The evacuation which is taking&apos; place only concerns the metal machinery and stock. You must prepare (in case of a complete military evacuation) for the evacuation of all stocks of wood and coal. I suggest that the wooden planks could be made into rafts and moved by river to Milcov.Goetz. The steam-engiues which remain must be destroyed at once if they cannot be moved soon.C. B. THOMSON, Colonel, Chief of the British Military Mission in Roumania.This order comprises all other factories of military importance.By order.J.
