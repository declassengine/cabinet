301Munitions of War Bill.MEMORANDUM.The main object of this Bill is to enable the Ministry of Munitions to carry into effect a scheme of dilution of skilled labour by the introduction of less skilled labour (either male or female) upon private work.There is an immediate demand for 15,600 skilled engineers, and there is a prospective demand for 16,500. The only possible means that can be seen of satisfying this demand is that skilled engineers who are at present engaged on private and commercial work and other work not necessary to the prosecution of the war should be set free to undertake Government work. In order to secure the release of &quot;these skilled engineers it is necessary that the Government should have the good-will of the trade unions concerned. It is essential, therefore, that any provision to secure their release must at the same time provide that for the sacrifice required from the men, there will be compensating sacrifice on the part of the employers. It seems desirable, therefore, that as a set-off to the dilution proposed, provision should be made, in establishments where it is carried out, for the limitation of employers&apos; profits, for the keeping of a record of changes in trade practices, and for a guarantee of restoration under the Second Schedule of the Munitions of &quot;War Act, 1915, and in addition for the giving priority of re-employment to men trans-ferred as War Munitions Volunteers, in the same way as priority is secured for the re-employment of men taken from the shops for the colours. If, however, guarantees are afforded under these heads, it seems equitable that provision should also be made to prevent strikes in the factories affected., and that section 7 of the Act of 1915, dealing with leaving certificates should be applied. In this way it would be possible to protect private industries which are essential from the point of view of export and of other manufacture from the confusions due to loss of men or stoppage of work. .The Bill accordingly in its first clause gives power to the Minister to apply any or all of the provisions of the Munitions of War Acts, to any class of work where the Minister is satisfied that it is of national importance that those provisions should apply.13-4a
This will enable special branches of work being declared to be munitions work as occasion may arise, for instance, the manu-facture of agricultural implements is now being undertaken by a department of the Ministry of Munitions, and the workpeople and employers in the industry have agreed to work in accordance with the arrangements applicable to the munitions establishments on the understanding that their work shall be classified as munitions work.The proviso to the clause safeguards the interests of the workers by securing that if rules, practices or customs tending to restrict production or employment are suspended, the employers shall, also be subject to the provisions of the Act of 1915 as to the limitation of profits, and the Second Schedule to that Act, which provides for the keeping of records of changes of ,trade practices, restoration after the war, re-employment of workmen, and the maintenance of district rates.It will be observed that the Bill contains no provision for dealing with the limitation of profits otherwise than under section 4 of the Munitions of War Act, 1915. Such a method of dealing with the matter would, of course, involve a very great increase in the volume of work under the section. It is, however, possible, under section 20 of the Munitions of War Amendment Act, 1916, to transfer the management of the profits of establish-ments certified under the Bill to some other Government Department, and it is contemplated that a transfer would be made to the Inland Bevenue under this section.Clause 2 merely secures priority of employment to war munition volunteers as indicated above.Agreements have been entered into between various federations of employers and trade unions for the periodical revision of rates of wages so as to secure that wages shall advance with the advance in price of commodities. The awards under such agreements can affect only the members of the federations and the members of the trade unions who are parties to the agreement. In order to avoid&apos; strikes it seems desirable that such awards should be made binding on other employers and their workmen engaged in the same trade. Clause 3 is intended to effect this object.
