SECRET . G.T. 153Copy No.   I*jWAR   CABINET.Supply of Aeronautical Material to Russia,I. Letter from Secretary, Air Board to Secretary, War Cabinet, dated 8th March, 1917 (No. A.B. 123/35).II.   Uite &quot;by Mr. W. Layton, Ministry of Munitions, dated 12th March; 1917.I.Secretary, Air Board to Secretary, War Cabinet,AIR BOARD OFFICE, Strand,    W.C8th March, 1917Sir,I am directed by the President of the Air Board to request you to inform the War Cabinet that the Board have recently received from the Russian Naval and Military Dele-gates in this Country applications for the supply of large quantities of aeronautical materiel.The Naval application comprises the following -120 Rolls-Royce 250 H.P. engines 250 Clerget 110 H.P. engines50 Gnsme engines 100 Nieuport machinesbesides machine-guns,  ammunition,  cable and instruments.The request of the Military Delegates is for 800 aero-planes and a further application is how, the Board understand, in course of preparation.As the War Cabinet are aware, the number of squadrons attached to the British Expeditionary Force is undergoing large expansion and the provision of the requisite materiel will tax the manufacturing capacities of the Country to the utmost.     In fact, it is impossible for the Board at this moment to state with confidence that it will be possible to complete in the near future the full programme put forward by Sir Douglas Haig.On the other hand, the measures in course of adoption by the Admiralty for the purpose of meeting the submarine menace involve the construction of a large number of additional seaplanes which will entail a further drain upon the resources of the manufacturers of aircraft.In these circumstances, the Board feel that, in the absence of special instructions to the contrary, it is not open to them to do otherwise than inform the Russian Delegates of their inability to comply with their requests.The Board, however, understand that the general situation
on the Russian Front has recently &quot;been under the review of a Conference at P&apos;etrograd, and they think it right to draw attention to the above requests for assistance in order that they may receive, if the War Cabinet think   fit, special instructions on the subject.At the same timej I am.to request you to convey clearly to the War Cabinet that any assistance given to the Russian Government in the matter of the-supply of aircraft can only be furnished at the expense .of our own Forces and in reduction of the considered programmes of the Admiralty and War Office.I am,  etc.(Signed)   H.P. HARVEY,.  &apos; 11 *&apos;Note by Mr t Layton, Ministry of Munitions.All pur cessions.to Russia of British type material must of course diminish pro tanto the amount available for the British forces and the allocation&apos; depends on relative need..&apos;. The case for giving Russia aeroplanes is given in Section D, Chapter I of our report and the terms in which the offer was made are as follows&quot;As many aeroplanes as possible, with machine guns and, for a certain proportion, with wireless apparatus, up to a maximum of 800 aeroplanes during 1917.&quot;The 800 machines for the Army include those already promised, some of which, have been delivered to Major Valentine..As regards motors we were told in Petrograd that per* mission had already been given to place the necessary orders by the Anglo-Prench Committee in Paris , but we were Unable to verify thisiI suggest that the Cabinet should be asked to rule at once as to the military machines, but that the Faval one3 should be considered later by the new Committee with .other naval and military demands not included in the Agreement.(Signed)   W.T.
