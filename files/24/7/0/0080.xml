SECRET.    . Copy Ho. .      -G.T - 180.WAR CABINET .THE HIED OF A POLICY FOR DEALING WITH. LIVE STOCK.(Memo   by Mr. A.D. Hall).In view of the necessary restriction ef imports it is more desirable to effect the reduction 0n the ra** materials of food, i.e. feeding stuffs than on materials that can be directly employed as food,  e.g. wheat.    In feeding pigs,  6-7 lb. of barley or maize are consumed in producing one pound of pork: in feeding cattle, 2 lb. of cake in addition to grass,  roots, tt hay will be consumed in producing one pound of beef, whereas wheat is consumable by human beings to the extent of S0% and barley to 60$.With these considerations in view it has been agreed that the importation of feeding stuffs shall be reduced by something over one million tons per annum,  in addition the farmer will also be depr4ted of 600,000 tons of cffals as a result of the regulations for deeper milling.Thus the farmer will be short of from one-third to one-half of the imported supplementary feeding stuffs he was ac-customed to use before the War.At the same time cattle stocks in the United Kingdom were according to the returns of June 1916,  exceptionally high, aometfhat higher than they:had ever been before the War This estimate has been traversed on the grounds that the numbers of cattle and sheep coming forward at the principal markets during December 1916 and January 1917 were well below the normal,  the lower rate of drafting pointing to a lower total stock.The reduced number of fat-stock coming forward may however be due to the high price of feeding stuffs causing the farmer to fatten more slowly,  thus increasing the stock at the expense of the current meat supply.   If leftrhimself the farmer -will maklA%r^fort to continue hi3 usual methods of feeding, and in order to do so will touch upon materials directly available for human food,  e.g. home grown wheat, barley and oats,  and such imported grain as he cat; buy,  thus fording up the price of human food.There i3 evidence at the present time that farmers are feeding wheat to pig3.   Though the Food Controller1s order forbids the feeding of undamaged wheat to animals there is nothing to forbid the feeding of flour.   Farmers-who are not able to obtain the full market price for their wheat get it ground to feed the pigs (there is concrete evidence on this point).   Owing to the action of the Wheat Commission wheat is comparatively cheap as a feeding stuff and it pays the farmer to use his own wheat for pigs rather than sell it,  especially if it is not of the highest quality.    If he offers it at the highest market price and fails to sell, he takes this a3 an excuse for regarding his wheat as &quot;damaged&quot; grain that can be fed to animals.
3532Again it has &quot;been ascertained that there are approximately one million, eight hundred thousand quarters of unmalted Barley in &quot;brewers and malsters hands or under their control j that will not &quot;be wanted for beer under the present restrictions on brew-ing .       If used for the dilution of flour;  this barley would extend the bread supply of the country by one month1s comsump-tion of bread.      If action is not taken to retain this barley for human consumption it 7vrill certainly be sola for pig feeding for which purpose it will command a higher price than for milling.     Thus what may be a vitally necessary reserve of food will be lost;    for as pig food the 400,000 tons of barley will only realise 60,000 tons of pork seme months hence.     From the food point of -view there would be less waste if the barley were turned into beer.(Sote,      Since this was written the Wheat Com-mission has invited the brewers to offer this stock of barley,)As much of the barley as is near the mills should be &apos;pearled? because pearl barley forms one of the best sub-stitutes for potatoes, the supply of which will run out in 6 weeks&apos; or 2 months&apos; time, -In view of the danger of real scarcity and the fact that the bread supply is ail important to the majority of the Corn-munity, whereas a restriction of the meat supply is of less moment, it is necessary to adopt a-o once a definite policy of conserving stocks of the bread&quot; grains and of reducing the head of live stock in the country.The items in this policy should be:-(l)    To take effective measures to prevent tke consumption by stock of wheat and barley,(2)    To reduce the numbers of cattle (ether than milch cows), sheep and pigs in the country.     The War Office could build up their reserve of meat by retaining for themselves that portion of the meat import they nor/ allow to go to the civil population .     This would, throw the civil demand for meat upon the home production.      (ilote.&apos;   This is now arranged for.) The consequent rise of price, coupled with the dearness of feeding stuffs as their importation is reduced, will bring about an increased sale as will reduce stocks.     When the reduction has reached the desired limit importation of meat can be resumed,  or rationing to secure a reduced rate cf con-sumption can be substituted.     If the stocks are not cuffi--ciently reduced by the end of the summer a specific draught on the animals should be made and the meat canned or put in cold store, so as to liberate more land for the production of human food in 1918.
354(3)   To institute a register of the mileh cows, so that the j production of milk can he controlled, and the maintaining of cows in profit enforced.(This is under consideration, &quot;but so far as enquiries have gone is regarded as impracticable.   It is thought that price will have to be the induce-ment to maintain the milk supply)(4)     To set on foot an educational campaign in order to enlighten farmers on the most economical use of the feeding stuffs available and on the policy they are expected to Carry out, with regard to their live stock.    (Mr.Prothero hasprepared such a programme).reducinIt may be objected that the German experiment of g their live stock in the early days of the war led to disaster,.    The case is not, however, parallel.     The Germans looked for a comparatively early close to the war.     Had this expectation been realised the reduction of live stock, waste-fully as it v/as carried out, would have been safe enough. . Secondly, the Germans possess no extraneous source of fat, such as we obtain by our oil seed imports.     Thirdly we are only dependent on our home supplies of meat to the extent of one half, the reduction of the home stocks by one fifth or one quarter would therefore only ultimately reduce the supply of meat to the civil population by one eighth or one sixth. In view, however, of what is going on with regard to the feeding of home grown wheat, the stocks of barley still in brewers handsj and the ignorance of the farming ccmmui to the approaching reduction in feeding stuffs, it is that a decision should be reached and a policy enu: a very early date*:ityis important iciated atBoard of Agriculture &amp; fisheries. .16th March 1917.
