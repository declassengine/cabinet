MONTHLY ACCOUNTS OF TRADL AID NAVIGATION.The Bor-rd of Trade- have received from the Royal Commission on hheat a strong representation to the effect that the continued publication, not only of the weekly but also of the monthly imports of wheat ana other grain, is for the present inadvisable.   The Board have decided to act in accordance with the representa-tions of the rtheat Commission and the Monthly Accounts of Trade and Navigation for February are being, accord-ingly, issued without the usual detailed information regarding imports of grain and flour,   They show^how-ever the aggregate value of the grain and flour imported in the month.In consequence of representations made on behalf of the Controller of Shipping it has also been decided to omit from the Monthly Accounts the usual particulars of Shipping entered and cleared.In addition to the above mentioned changes in the Monthly Accounts for February, the Board of Trade pro-pose both for the purpose of economy an! of restricting the supply of information to the enemy that future monthly&quot; statements published for general circulation during the V/ar shall be made in a much more summary form than has   nit herto been customary.  All particulars of the countries to or from which goods are consigned will be omitted from the Monthly Statement, which will have the effect of reducing its bulk very considerably,-. It is also intended to apply to the other main cate-gories of food imports the same principle as has been adopted with regard to grain and flour^ i.e. to show only aggregate values of imports in the other main sub-groups   viz., meat, other non-dutiable food, dutiable food, tobacco.In order that the particulars regarding countries to which our exports are consigned may be available for those for whose assistance in the main they have been supplied in the past, it is intended to furnish to the leading Chambers of Commerce on a plication statements similar to those which have hitherto appeared in the Monthly Accounts wit1-, regard to classes&quot;of goods exported in which their members are interested.Tbe full particulars regarding imports and ex orts will of course continue to be compiled&quot;and will be avail--able for the confidential use of the various jjepart-ments of the Government,A.E.S.15th March, 1917.
