On 14th Octoher 1916 the Ministry of Munitions was informed that the Secretary of State for War approved that an order, given provisionally on 26th September, -for-1,000 Tanks pVer and.above thenriginal 350, should, stand.-   - The letter stated that Army Council.understood&apos;that-,production of.the 1,000 would begin from 12th Hovember at 20 a week until 50 have been delivered when production would increase to 40 a week about 1st January 1917 thereby, completing order by end of June.     Improvements &apos; in design and armament should be introduced as found possible without hampering output as above. -       &quot; -Ministry of Munitions replied on 50th October that orders had been placed for the additional 1,.000 Tanks, at the rate of delivery specified in Army Council letter of 14th October. -2.     At a Conference held on 25rd llovember between representatives ofT &quot;inistry- of MunitionsWar office, and General Headquarters, prance, held at the offices&apos; of the Director General Mechanical Warfare Supply (Colonel Stern) the.; following programme was forecasted :-(i;     At that time there were in France approximately 70Tanks (Mark I) which might or might nof.be of usefor work-in 1917. (ii)     By the beginning of January 50 Tanks (Mark&quot;IIslightly improved design) would be ready for&apos;&quot;delivery.    -(iii)     By 7th February. 50 further -Tanks (Kark III with.;...:, slight further improvements) would be delivered. H..B. The above, constitute the&apos;.original order for 250a&quot; -^   Of      :        &apos;
;Of. this number the first 150 were Mark I distributed as follows :-France 125:, Egypt 3, Home for training etc, 17. (iv)    From February 7th to end of llay Hark TV (considerablyimproved^ design) would;be produced at rate of 20 a . week, production to.;continue till entire new type -was adopted, which Colonel Stern explained was tobe a much lighter machine than the existing one.o.     At a further. Conference held at the War Office on the same day (.23rd November) at, which Sir Douglas Haig, Deputy Chief Imperial General - Staff, hi- Montagu,  Colonel Stern and Mr d.&apos;2yh court were present,: the following general conclusions sumraari sing-the requirements were arrived at&apos;(i)   Tanks, are required in as large&apos;numbers as&quot; possible, (ii)    It is important to get as many as possible before &apos;&apos;iay.(iii) ; It is very important to consider and adopt improvements in design from time to time but almost any design now is likely to be better than no Tank. (,iv)   It is. highly &quot;desirable that no other supply should be interfered with, ^f it is necessary to do so in order to fulfil, the requirements-(in Tanks) General Headquarters should be: informed through the proper channel before any action is taken,
4.     On the 6th February last Minister of Munitions communicated the following estimate of deliveriesTo be supplied by February 17th.      &quot;100 -Mark II &amp; III.during March		. , ,120	Mark IV.it	April	120.	ait	May	140	iiii	June	200	itit	July	240	itti	August	260	iiit	September	- 280	ii...	Total	1560	Mark JJ.This estimate of deliveries was in keeping with the programme arranged at the Conference on 23rd tfovember, but in the letter dated:&quot;6th&apos; February it was stated that this rate of output was not guaranteed, but was the best forecast that could be given on the information then available.The 100 Mark II and III Tanks have been delivered during January and February.    50 of them are required for training in England,     .The remaining 50&apos; are. being sent, to France.&apos;-bv     Onr 28th j February the Ministry informed the Council that there would be no delivery of-&apos;Mark IV Tanks in March, and that the output for April would amount to only .80 and that for&apos; May to 100.     The aggregate delivery for. the three months March, April, and May will therefore be 200 behind the previous estimate given-on 6th February, which amounted to .380 for those months.
6.   , To enable a Commander-in-Chief to make his plans of operations it is necessary that he should be in possession of reliable data as to the resources at his disposal.   It follows therefore that forecasts of the rate of delivery of material of all kinds should be conservative.   If the rate of delivery should exceed the estimate it will clearly be no disadvantage for the Commander-in-Chief to have at his -disposal a larger reserve than he had anticipated, but; if the output fails to reach the standard estimated he may find himnelf in the unenviable position of either having to modify his original plan or having to risk a failure from lack of adequate means to carry it out.War Office.5th March, 1917.
