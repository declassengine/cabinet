The Department has prepared a draft Bill embodying a compre-hensive scheme of educational development, which has been referred to the parliamentary Draughtsman.With a view to giving effect to the financial proposals sanc-tioned by the War Cabinet, Regulations providing for a supplementary Grant to Local Education Authorities for Elementary Education have been submitted to the Treasury.I have instructed the Inspectors of the Board to furnish me with Reports of Educational Experiments which are being conducted in Public Elementary Schools throughout the Country.   The Reports show that there are a substantial number of schools in&apos;which Authorities and Teachers have taken advantage of the full liberty for experiment given by the Board&apos;s &quot;Regulations and have initiated considerable departures from the curriculum and methods ordinarily used, some of which may prove to be of distinct educational value in the future.Since taking up the duties of my Office I have made it part of my work to visit a number of Schools and Educational Institutions in London with the object of getting into personal touch.with the teachers and of familiarising myself at first hand with average specimens of each type of School and Institution in the area.A Conference of representatives of Examining Bodies was held at the Offices of the Board yesterday to consider proposals for the examination of British Prisoners of War interned abroad.     The Conference unanimously adopted a Resolution proposing to recognize in a liberal and sympathetic spirit work done or examinations passed by such Prisoners while in captivity and to make special arrangements with as little delay and as much regard to the prisoner&apos;s eircum-stances as possible, for the examination of those who require it after their return home.Jj. a . 4 * A.-w16th March, 1917.
