Tea - The rood Controller has held further conferences with importers, brokers, and buyers of tea, with the result that these several interests are m course of agreement on a scheme .by. \.hioh imports of tea shall be maintained at a certain point, so as to enable the retail.supply of tea to be effected at a reasonable and, it is hoped,slightly lower price&apos; than&apos; at. present. -Flour - The national&apos;Association of British and Irish Millers have submitted a plan for the better distribution of flour, the main provisions of which are as follows : -(1) Each miller shall have one price and one price pnly, for each grade of flour which he manufactures. This price shall be for the flour at the mill where it has been manufactured.(2) All flour shall be invoiced at this price, and the cost of delivery shall be added as a separate item in each invoice., (3) The terms of trading shall be the same to all -   customers ;.with the exception of His Majesty&apos;s Forces and Public Institutions..This scheme has been agreed with the Royal Commission on V/heat Supplies and approved by the Ministry of Food.Further arrangements for regulating the price of flour and of milling offals are under discussion.Malt. A Malt Clearing House has been set up with the approval of the Ministry of Food, to apportion and regulate available stocks of Malt in the United llin-dom among brewers, according to their requirements for brewing under the restriction to ten million barrels.1.111k - At a conference held on March 9 between represen-tatives of this Ministry and of the Board of Agriculture, itwas
.. S decided that an announcement. should he made that the maximum price for next winter would, be fixed at a figure which w uld allow a reasonable profit for dairy farmers, after taking into account the cost of cattle foods, difficulty in procuring labour, rates of wages, and other revelant circumstances-;     It was further agreed that the existing summer price should be subject to revision in case of any exceptional circumstances, such as a prolonged drought.haximum Prices foj Provisions -   &quot;with the sanction of the Food Controller, the London and Provincial Produce Exchanges have settled a list of maximum importers&apos;, manufactuers&apos;, and curers&apos; prices for bacon, ham, cheese, butter and lard, and have agreed that in no case should they be exceeded in the united &quot;ingdom.     These prices will be binding until the 25rd March when they will be revised by Lord Devonport in the light of the experience gained during that period.    In connection with the supply of bacon from Canada, the Food Controller is in communication with the Shipping Controller with the view to regulating freights which have increased enormously during&apos; the past three vieeks.PUBLIC CATERING. The Food Controller has continued his conferences with the representatives of Hotels, Restaurants and Clubs for the purpose of preventing waste and of making the consumption of food in public places conform as far as practicable with the rations suggested for private households.    The scheme of an Order has been settled and is being submitted to the War Cabinet.PUBLICITYThe distribution of propagandist literature has been continued throughout the week.   Applications from the clergyare
are still coming in for copies of the Food Controller-&apos;s Appeal and other leaf lets Issued -by&quot;&quot;the Ministry, over300,000  COpieS   Of   this   nppc a.1 iietVo   Do op. Uis tributroCi by   oxiiomeans.     Another of Dr. Spriggs&apos; articles on &quot;Food and How to Save It&apos;&apos; has been sent out to some 1.450 newspapers and journals throughout the country, and the first three articles have now been reprinted in pamphlet form. .   The Food Controller1 Pledge Cards for display in the windows of private houses have been sent out for Press Notices, and numerous applications for them have already been received.    These cards will also be distributed at meetings held in connection with food economy throughout the country.The National War Savings Committee has placed its organisation at the disposal of the Department and a campaign on similar lines to that which.they conducted in connection with the War Loan is being started. .The Directors of $omens&apos; Service have already held twelve public meetings for the purpose of bringing home to all classes the necessity of observing the Food Controller^ rules for voluntary rationing,, and have planned meetings and confer-ences to be held In all parts of the Ningdom.    Detailed su^es-tions for a propagandist campaign have been arranged in consulta tion with the &quot;war Savings Committee.MISCEIIANFOUS.Mr. Austin Taylor has been appointed to represent the Ministry of Food at meetings of the Railway Executive Committee to be held for the discussion of transport questions.The
The ministry.is in communication with the Irish Department of Agriculture and 1 isheries with a view to the encouragement, by increased transport facilities   of the shipment of herrings rnd mackerel from Ireland to Great Britain. &apos;Preserved Fish Food-     In conjunction with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, an endeavour is being made to popularise the sale of preserved fish generally and salted herrings in particular.     There are very large&apos; stocks 02 these pickled&apos;&quot;hetrings, not only from the Scotch Fisheries, but also from Scandinavian, countries purchased by:the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department ;    and these are being carefully tested.   In the meantime, exports of those salt herrings are Rigorously restricted with some slight exceptions in favour of France and the Colonies,An Order is being drafted to enable Fresh ater Fifh from Holland and Ireland to be sold In Fngland during tbe&apos; close season, when otherwise the sale would be illegal.
Iiap^rts : As regards imports of food (Table A) these, gene rail sneaking, have been ziainiained at much the same general level during the present calendar year as during the corresponding nerfod of 1916 (see columns 5 and 6 of table .    A)..heat  (including flour) maize, beef and mutton imports are practically equal in the two years.The imports of margarine, cheese and butter have slightly increased., ^hil^-thiss^^f^su^j^^exxin^and hams. ^ have slightly decreased.Rice shows a considerable decrease of i-rports.   This decrease, however, is substantially&apos;&quot;oonroensated by h decrease of re-exports (which have now been practically stopped) and therefore do-es not&quot; &quot;rep re -sent. a. net t loss of food in the country.   Rice is the only article of food of which there was any considerable re-export in 1916.The only other articles in the lis^ showing a substantial diminution of imports are barley and oats. This is consequent en the adoption of the uoliev laid down by the Pood Controller for the guidance of &quot;the Vheat Commission of preferring wheat flour, maize, rice, &amp;o,, which are under Government control, to barley and oats for import.   The demand for barley is substantially reduce by the prohibition of malting.
Stocks ;   T,-ble B gives the stocks of the principal foods anc?feeding stuffs in the United Kingdom at the 1st ;larch, 1917, and in 1916 respectively. ;&apos;   -&apos;7heat shows a decrease of shout 9 per pent,, which should he fully compensated for hy the Itanufacture of Flour and Bread Order.Oats,, maize, butter^ margarine, cheese and tec1 show substantial decreases.&apos; Rice and cocoa show substantial increases, while brcon and haras,..rant ton, oheese and ooffee show smaller ones.The barley stocks, excluding those in the h*mds of the brewers and malsters, are practically; equal in the two years.    In 1917, however, ther?r is,- in addition, available for human or maimal consumption the stock of barley which would otherwise havi? been used for brewing, amounting at February 10, 1917, to 338,000 tons,For the chief cereals later estimates are rvailahle as follows7heat- * The stocks at Karch 12 were 1,344,000 tons as compared with 1,475,000 tons at the corresponding date in 1.91.6, and. 1,397,000 tons on-March 1, 1917,3a rley; (apart from mo 1st era stocks).   The stocks at irarch IE were 167,000 tons as compared with 186,000 tons at i:arch 1, 1917.Oats ;   The stocks at :larch 1?. were 798,000 tons as compared with 919,000 tons at Ilarch 1, 1917,VMze ;   The stocks at :larch IB were 191,000 tons as compared with 195,000 tons pi &quot;arch 1, 1917,9
449Consumption of Heat :    Cable C shows that the numbers of fat stock - entering the 51 principal markets in G-rert 3ritrin in the last two months hove been markedly less thrn the corresponding numbers in 1916.    7his is particularly the 0&apos;ase with sheen and pigs.   The decline of cattle is smeller.The swyoll-ss of meat entering the Central Market in London,&apos; during the first two months of the; present year, are also wr-11 below those for the corresponding Period of last year.    Comc-nring January and February, it will be seen that in 1917 the supplies fell from 6,927 tons in January to 5,793 tons per week in February, or 16 per cent.   In 1916 the supplies fell from 7,550 for January to 7,152 tons for February, or 5 per cent.   The grrrter reduction in 1917 is fairly attributeble to the influence of the voluntary rationing system, announced on February 3rd-,A return received from Glasgow is tabulated on by carcases and bones and does not afford any convenient comparison.   The figures for beef do not suggest any considerable ohange in supplies as between 1916 and 1917. 3nt thorn is a heavy fall in mutton and lamb (about lo;!-in January and 80,* in February) and also in pork (36;$ in Janwry and over 55,j in February) as compared with last.year.esale prices j     In Table D, the latest wholesale prices, as compared with those of a month ago, show, in most cases, an increase.     The increase is most marked in the case of choose (about 19 per cent.for English and 15 per cent,for Canadian^&apos;   rice (12 per cent.)-3bacon
450bacon (15 per cent. Canadian and 10 per cent Irish) and mutton (7 per cent.)    The cereals, other thrn rice, all show a slight increase,  -s also does tea.Sun-ar.. shows no change, while slight decreases are recorded for Argentine chilled beef, linseed palm kernels -and palm kernel cakes.If the comparison be made not with a month ago but with a year ago-, the articles s owing the most striking increases ere cheese (70 per cent.) tea (about -fe per cent.), bacon (44 per cent to 53 per cent.), beef (47 per cent.), rice (45 per cent.), oil seed cake (52 per cent, to 66 per cent.) Barley and sugar show the smallest relative increases and British wheat has an increase of about 35 per. cent]It PRICIS -        Tatele F. gives retail prices, at March 1st and other dates, for some of t,.e most important commodities. The articles showing most increases as compared with a month ago, are cheese (10 per cent.), bacon (S per cent.), and margarine (5 per cent.)     Fggs and Potatoes both show substrn-tial decreases.As compared with a year ago, the articles showing most Increases are potatoes (nearly 120 per cent.), cheese (47 per cot eggs (46 per cent), mutton (27 to 40 per cent.), and beef (27 to 36 per cent.)   Butter also shows an increase of 33 to 36 per cent.)The most marked recent rises of prices, however, have taken place, hat in regard to the principal foodstuffs,included in table F, but in regard to a number of subsidiary foods, which to some extent act as subsitutes for meat, wheat and potatoes,   As between February 1st and Barch 1st, the retail
prices of butter beans, haricot beans,  lentils and sagoincreased by amounts ranging from 17 per cent, to 25 percent., while those of oatmeal, peas and tapioca increased by1&apos;or 13 per cent.     Rice also increased in price but not to the same extent.     Later information shows a further considerable rise since inarch 1st. in the csse of be ens, sago and tapioca-.
