KoreanBoard of A0riculture &amp; Fisheries.Scottish Board of AgricultureDepartment of Agriculture, Ireland.Ministry of FoodPrime Minister&apos;s Secretariat.Director of Supplies and Transport, War Office.Army Canteen Committee.War Office.The CHIEF .SECRETARY invited statements as to the potatoes available.The SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND stated that Scotland was destitute of potatoes, except for a limited quantity of seed.Mr.&apos; DENNIS estimated the potatoes at present available in England as about ZOfo of a normal supply at this date, or about 120,000 tons, excluding those earmarked for the Army.Mr, MIDDLETON stated that the normal supply for Great Britain on 1st March was from 5 to 600,000 tons, and estimated that the available supply on 1st March of this year was 280,000 to 300,000 tons.
Mr. CAMPBELL   stated tnat the only available supply in Ireland was that in the north-eastern counties, where potatoes were grown for the market.     About 50,000 tons beyond the requirements for local necessities could probably be obtained.  &quot; Of these 10,000 tons would be essential for the necessary food supply of the southern cities customarily provided from the north-eastern counties; 30,000 tons would be requisitioned for the Army; 6,000 tons were needed for the supplies which the Department of Agriculture had under-taken to provide for allotment tillage in Ireland.   The Department had provisionally undertaken to secure 5,000 for the seed supply requirements of the Board of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, but that supply could only be obtained by means of diminutions in the other demands.Col.&apos;MORGAN stated that the Army requirements to the end of June amounted to 36,000 tons for canteen consumption of which 29,000 tons have been already requisitioned by the Canteen Committee; and for Army rations for forces in the field 33,000 tons, of which 30,000 tons would be requisitioned in the north-eastern counties of Ireland.The CHIEF SECRETARY inva;te&amp;   discussion upon the question whether the difficulties caused by the undoubtedshortage could be met by the vesting of all potatoes in a Governmental suthority and the control   of the supply so as to secure such economies in all&apos;directions as would safeguard tillage requirements and Army requirements upon the minimum essential scale and provide for distribution to the best public advantaue of the residue of consumable potatoes.Mr. D3MIS was of opinion that while requisitioning would be the ideal method of securing and regulating the available supply, it would probably break down in practice when the various questions of distribution which are involved would come to be faced.     He also pointed out that it was now too late for any effective steps to be taken for requisitioning the 1916 crop.Col. MORGAN was of opinion that the existing means of requisition under Army control would be effective to secure the possession and subsequent regulated distribution of all available potatoes.The Representatives of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries expressed great confidence that the necessary interferences with the movements of potatoes which would be involved in a general requisition of potatoes wouldbe highly detrimental to tillage, having regard to the stage which the agricultural operations of the -year had reached.     They thought the delay of even two or three weeks in potato planting would have a very serious consequence upon the prospects of the potato crop
THE BALANCE OF OPINION IN THE CONFEilENCS WAS ON THE TOOLS DEFINITELY AGAINST THE GENERAL REQUISITION OF POTATOES.The CHIEF SECRETARY next invited discussion upon the question wharthsE   a present increase of potato prices would probably be effective as a means of bringing to market supplies of potatoes which at present are withheld.The AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS were of opinion that the market shortage of potatoes is by no means entirely due to the holding up of supplies for increase prices; and Col. GORDON LSITH pointed out that the object of a progressive scale of prices had been to ensure diminished comsumption at this time with a view to the necessities of later months.Mr. MIDBLSTON expressed the view that it would not be advantageous in the common interest to bring forward the general supply   of ware potatoes at a rate which would lead to their very speedy consumption, but pointed out that the urgent present necessity was that of bringing forward the requisite supplies of seed potatoes.THE GENERAL OPINION OF THE CONFERENCE WAS ADVERSE TO A PRESENT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF WARE POTATOES (i.e. potatoes for food).With regard to SEED POTATOES, further discussion followed, and the opinion of the Conference proved to be in favour of an increase of  2 per ton   forth-1-with in the price of seed potatoes as governed bythe orders of the Food Controller.     The effect of this increase would be that until 1st April seed potatoes would be attracted by an increased price to the full amount of  2 per ton, and from 1st April to 15th April the present increase of  2 would have the effect of giving an increase of  1 per ton beyond the price as now fixed by the Food Controller.,TEE CONFERENCE AGREED TO RECOMMEND THE INCREASE OF  2 PER TON FORTHWITH IN THE AUTHORISED PRICE FOR SEED POTATOES.     Mr. Middleton dissented.        Mr. Campbell doubted.
THE CONFERENCE WAS OP OP INI Oil THAT MEANS SHOULD BE POUND TO ACOELERATE PURCHASE OF SEED POTATOES IN IRELAND.       On behalf of the Irish Department of Agriculture it was stated that an increase of  1 per ton for seed potatoes in Ulster to be approved by the Pood Controller would no doubt have the effect of bringing to market the necessary supp.1ies.     This course would, however, have some financial disadvan-tages inasmuch as the Department ha3 undertaken with local authorities to provide their seed potatoes for the Irish tillage scheme upon the footing of the present prices.       It was estimated that the fulfil-ment of this undertaking upon the footing of a present increase in the price of seed potatoes in Ulster would involve the Department in a pecuniary loss to the amount of, perhaps,  4,000.THE REPRESENTATIVES OP THE BRITISH DEPARTMENTS urgently advised that, if need be, this loss should be incurred in the common interest and with a view to accelerate the production of seed potatoes for tillage in the United Kingdom, ?:id i\.k&apos;z the consequential loss should be, subject to the sanction of tna Treasury, treated as an expense of the Irish tillage scheme for war purposes.THE POOD CONTROLLER   agreed in the opinion that the proposed increase is necessary in the public interest and that it should be made without delay and notwithstand-ing the apprehended and incidental loss.The proposed increase of  1 per ton for seed potatoes in Ulster was agreed to be aivi3aole.(The attendance of the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons was required at this stage,    and the Conference proceeded to discuss the question of whether potato supplies could be by any of the available agencies diverted to Scotland in order to meet the shortage of potatoes for food in that country.)
2iSTHE SSGKSTAHY, FOE SCOTLAND   informs me that:As regards the position in Scotland,   the conference was of opinion that the only altema&quot;-tive to the fixing of a special higher price for the Scottish consumer   (a solution which was understood to he ruled out r at least for the moment)   would he to restrict the potato ration on the basis of which supplies have &quot;been requisitioned for the Army Canteen Committee for the use of the Army in the United Kingdom. The present rate of consumption for that pur-pose was stated as amounting to 2.300 tons per week.       Color el Gordon Leith objected to any such restriction.      He also stated that Lord Derby was advised that his powers do not extend to requisitioning for the Army and re-leasing part of the requisitioned stock for civilian use.       On behalf of the Food Controller, on the other hand, it was suggested that, if such stocks were released and then requisitioned for Scotland by the Food Controller, any legal diffi-culty might &quot;be got over.It was considered reasonable that any shortage of potatoes affecting the civilian population should be shared by the Army in the United Kingdom, whose requisitioning has been an the basis of a normal general supply,   and it was recommended that the amount to be released by instalments for the benefit of Scotland should be 10,00b tons out of a total of 29,000 tons at present under requisition,   the reason justifying such special treatment being that Scotland has been denuded of seed potatoes   (which in present circumstances means practically all potatoes grown in Scotland)   for the benefit of other parte of the country.The Army representatives intimated their dissent and requested that the matter should be referred for the decision of. t&quot; e \fo.r Cabinet.(Intd.)
