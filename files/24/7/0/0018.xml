/v 4(Ci rculated to the War Cabinet with reference to War Cabinet 84, Minute 2 (d) )imiTim WORKERS II? FRANCE.Note by the War Office,1It may be premised that in France men are not &quot;exempted&quot; for munition work.   They are all at the disposal of the Ministry of War which details men for this form of service,With reference to the request made in War Cabinet Meeting 84, Minute 2 (d), that War Office should furnish any information in their possession as to the position in France with regard to the exemption of munition workers, it is understood that the total number of men of French Military Age employed on 1st September 1916 in France on munition work was 489,655,     Of these 125,575 were not fit for General Service (Service Auxiliaire),   Of the remainder 129,867 were over British Military Age (41),   The balance 234,215 were skilled men, fit for service in the field according to British .-standards.   Those under 34 were all &quot;specialises&quot; but even these so far a3 possible, are, from time to time, replaced by men from 35 - 41 years of age.The central arrangements for selecting these men are in the hands of the Under Secretary for V/ar who acts as  &apos; Minister of Munitions..   (M.Thomas) .   From the &quot;fichesw in use for securing the release of men required are attached, it will be seen that the power of veto rests with G.^.G.    The most common grounds of veto are (a) youth,  (b) employment as artificer,  (e) posting to artillery or Machine Gun Corps.An increasing number of women and aliens, including Asiatics and Africans, is employed.   They are reported as becoming skilled.The
The contrast &quot;between British and French methods with regard to the.supply of labour in munition factories is striking.   In France the Aruy decides what men can be spared from the field for work in the factories,    In Britain,  speaking broadly, the Ministry of Munitions is in a position to decide what men can be spared from Munitions work for the Army.-7th laarch, 1917.
