SECRET.Conference of the Allies in Petrograd, January-February 1917.PART I.-GENERAL NOTE.THE Munitions Sub-Commission was entirely occupied with an examination of the needs of Russia not only in artillery and other munitions, but also in raw materials,, machinery, and commercial products. All these various demands had been prepared in considerable detail before the arrival of the Mission, and, in particular, great care had been spent in drawing up for the first time a carefully thought-out scheme of artillery equipment.A summary of these detailed demands, together with various comments and recommendations, was presented before the sittings were concluded in a report to Lord Milner by the British representatives on the Sub-Commission (see Part III below), while the conclusions were embodied in consultation with the French and Italian delegates in a separate statement which was presented to the Minister of War (see Part II below).This document was accepted by him as the report of the Munitions Sub-Commission subject to the reservation that small changes should if necessary be made in the allotment of available transport facilities.Tonnage.The demands put forward amounted with existing orders to some 13 million tons of material, but though very little of this could be ruled out as unnecessary, it was clear that this quantity of goods could not possibly be imported into Russia in 1917.It was not easy with the information at our disposal to determine what exactly were the limiting factors to the capacity for importation. Official figures were put forward showing that the ports could deal with 12f million tons in 1917, while the railways, it was said, could handle 8 million tons. The figures would not, however,, stand examination, and at a special conference the port capacity was reduced to 4,431,000 tons. Even this figure was considered by both the British and French officers to be excessive, and as it seemed impossible to arrive at definite limits either for the ports or railways, the shipping tonnage arrangements for the year, as given by the Admiralty, viz., 3,400,000 tons, were taken as our basis. This figure will severely tax the resources of the ports, and will require some very important improvements in organisation. In view of the possibilities of delays in delivery and losses, it seemed, however, desirable to allow a margin 25 per cent, above this figure in the supply arrangements for 1917. The programme was therefore based on the figure of 4\ million tons for the calendar year.Artillery, &amp;c.Of this amount 1,200,000 tons were allocated to artillery. This is far greater than the amount of these munitions hitherto imported, but it represents little more than one quarter of the demands. The total is largely composed of 3-inch shell, rifles, S.A.A., aeroplanes and explosives already on order, together with cessions of heavy artillery and ammunition already promised. But these supplies would have left the artillery equipment very far from adequate, and it was therefore proposed that Great Britain should allocate to Russia four batteries of 6-inch, two batteries of 8-inch, and one battery of 9-2-inch howitzers per month for six months starting from June next. No more guns than those previously ceded could possibly be sent into Russia until Archangel opens, and the offer will leave the whole British output of April and May for our own forces.[370-1] Bprinted for the use of the cabinet.   march 1917.
The proposal was put forward on a monthly basis, as a regular supply of artillery will greatly facilitate the work of training, &amp;c. The Minister of War was very anxious that Great Britain should take, full responsibility-for shipping and delivering these batteriescomplete with all equipment in Russia, just as it would if placing them on the Western front. Russia is herself turning out five fi-inch howitzer batteries a month, and with the cession proposed will be able to put into the field in the last half of 1917 nine 6-inch and three heavier howitzer batteries a month. It is thought that this ratio of three to one represents a suitable ratio of 6-inch to heavier artillery. Ammunition, for these guns must be supplied from home, for the production of Russian type ammunition is still inadequate for the guns in the field and is limited by the output of shell steel. There is no prospect of Russia&apos;s shell capacity increasing sufficiently to leave a margin for making British type ammunition. Neither France nor ourselves were able to offer help in the matter of field guns, though the require-ments for the equipment of new divisions, for increasing the establishment per division (54 instead of 36 per division are aimed at) and for making good wastage are greatly in excess of Russians own output. As regards aeroplanes, the needs of Russia are at least as important as in the case of artillery, and though no precise numbers were given, Russia was told that the utmost possible number of aeroplanes would be sent up to a total of 800 machines complete with machine guns and wireless apparatus. These will be sent to Major Valentine, and the training of pilots for these machines will be under his control. The Grand Duke Alexander has also arranged to send regularly a certain number of men and officers both to France and .England to study British methods and machinery. Further, the Grand Duke was informed that the British Government hoped to be able to send one or two squadrons of fighting aeroplanes with personnel and equipment, to sweep the front before the Russian offensive starts. The Russians were also offered fifty Stokes and fifty 2-inch trench mortars with ammunition for experimental and demonstration purposes, in addition to the heavy mortars already being supplied.Offers wrere also made with regard to propellant and explosives. In the former case, emphasis was laid on the danger of Russia&apos;s growing dependence on America, which is even greater than in our own case. There is unfortunately nothing that can be done to modify the situation materially this year, and we must therefore undertake to provide sufficient imports ,to enable Russia to complete her full ammunition programme. The figures are subject to small modifications as a result of the decisions of the Conference, but it is essential that arrangements should be made now to send forward an adequate supply as soon as Archangel opens. If this is done, Russia can afford to run the risk of using up all her reserves during the intervening months. It is also important that the supplies should be as evenly spread as possible in order to prevent unduly large accumulations at Archangel.Other Artillery Department demands, together with the answers given by the British delegates, are enumerated in a statement given below.Other Requirements,The next demand in order of urgency is for railway material. But there are already 700,000 tons on order for delivery this year, and it is extremely improbable that orders could be placed for additional quantities, or, if placed, could be transported this year. The need is, however, so urgent that it was agreed to recommend that orders should be placed now for delivery at the end of 1917 of 200,000 tons of rails and 100,000 tons of rolling-stock.Special importance was also attached to the demand for barbed wire. It is true there are 60,000 tons awaiting shipment at Vladivostock, but when this is moved it will not go very far to meet requirements. Most of the front is very inadequately barbed, and on the southern front it is almost entirely lacking. The demands will also be exceedingly heavy if there is any appreciable movement of the line during the present summer. Russia is herself making barbed wire, but has a capacity for barbing still larger quantities. It was therefore decided to recommend that orders should be placed for sufficient wire to keep her factories employed.These two items railway material and wire together with 1,200,000 tons for the Artillery Department, and 1,500,000 tons which was agreed as the minimum coal requirement, amount to 3,510,000, leaving only 740,000 tons for other demands.Of this it is proposed to allocate 280,000 tons to metals, including 100,000 tons of shell steel and 200,000 tons to motor transport.   This latter figure will involve scaling
down existing orders and allocating tonnage as between France, Italy, and Great Britain. The Minister of War should be pressed to confirm or modify this total and to make an allocation at the earliest possible moment. Roumania is to have 120,000 tons of the balance, leaving 140,000 tons for marine demands, army equipment, and all commercial requirements. A comparison of this figure with the demands given in the detailed report below, shows that, by agreeing in principle to this tonnage programme, the Russian Government are prepared to face the acntest shortage in commercial materials, cotton, rubber, wool, &amp;c, and to cut off almost entirely the importation of. machinery for the sake of getting large additional quantities of artillery and coal into the country. Russians needs are, in fact, extremely acute, and all possible steps should be taken to&quot; secure that the proposed total of 3,400,000 tons is supplied, and, if possible, exceeded.Capacity of the Ports.It is, of course, useless to send goods which can neither be unloaded nor moved away by rail. But the work done at Archangel in 1916 was far better than was expected-the port being practically cleared by Christmas-and with last year&apos;s experience it should be possible to make a further very appreciable increase in 1917. The capacity of the Vladivostock route is limited by the railway, but it is not impossible that means may be found for increasing the capacity of the Siberian line. This is a matter to which Mr. Bury is giving special attention, while it has also been suggested that the Japanese could render some heip in providing rolling-stock, and possibly also in developing-the route through Dalny.There remains the question of the Murman Railway, which is one of immediate and pressing importance, in view of the fact that every ton of material which is to reach the front by midsummer must pass into Russia by this route. The railway will also be of special importance next winter for the regular provisioning with ammunition of the British type artillery which will then be in the field. When the Mission reached Romanov only one munition train, containing 120 tons of goods, had passed over the line, though there were then 20,000 tons afloat awaiting discharge. No, reliable information was received from Romanov during our stay in Petrograd; but on Monday, the 19th February (n.s.), Lord Milner presided at a meeting at which were present various representatives of the Railway Department, including representa-tives of the Construction and Traffic Departments, as well as representatives of the Admiralty and of the Ministry of Commerce, which controls the ports.These gentlemen were agreed that we could safely rely on the transport of 120,000 tons before the line becomes impassable in May, and this total, if realised, would permit of the despatch of most of the urgent material, which should be on the front by the summer. It was urged that this estimate was a conservative one, and it was pointed out that the railway had only just been taken over from the Construction Department by the regular Traffic Department.These anticipations were, however, not confirmed by the result of enquiries at Romanov itself on our return.   The cargo afloat had risen to 44,000 tons, of which it was hoped to send 12,000 round to Archangel by icebreaker, while 24,000 tons more&apos; were expected.   The tonnage forwarded by rail by the 7th February (o.s.) had reached 5,180 tons, and was leaving at the rate of 200 tons a day, le., one train a day as against five a day required to complete the February programme.   The discharging berths are capable of dealing with 1,500 tons a day, but both warehouse accommodation and shore labour are inadequate, with the result that trucks which are needed to move material along the piers are being used as storing places in the rear of the port. Hence the unloading gangs were standing idle waiting for trucks.   There is only warehouse capacity for some 5,000 tons, and this is largely being used for stores in connection with the naval base.   There are, in short, a number of serious troubles which are preventing the clearing of the port.   But the difficulties are all such as are capable of being overcome by energetic handling.   The work of the next four weeks will show whether there is any prospect of getting through anv considerable volume of material by May. &amp;        &amp;In this connection the Minister of War has agreed to reserve the railway exclusively for certain artillery requirements, and orders have been issued to ship no other goods either from New York or from London. Our journeys over the railway were very satisfactory, and, when certain weak places have been strengthened, curves and gradients reduced, and passing places increased this summer, the line should enable us to pour into Russia a continuous stream of ammunition and other munitiona during the winter of 1917-18.[370-1] B 2
Archangel remains, however, the most important means of access to Russia, and at that port the chief difficulty is labour, which is not sufficiently controlled or of good enough quality. The Mission therefore pressed upon the attention of the Government a scheme for the militarisation of shore labour handling general cargo. This scheme, which was drawn up by Commodore Kemp and discussed by the officers of the Mission with British officials having a knowledge of conditions in the White Sea, was approved by the Minister of Marine and the Minister of War. On the day we left Petrograd the proposal was submitted by Admiral Korvin (the Russian admiral in charge of Archangel) to General Gourko, who will have to find the men and officers, but we are unable to say whether his concurrence was obtained. The matter has been left, so far as British interests are concerned, in the hands of a Committee consisting of General Poole, Commodore Kemp, and Mr. Lindley.On the whole, if things go well, there is a prospect that the ports may be able to deal with more than 3,400,000 tons this year, and it is extremely desirable that, if there is evidence of this happening, the Admiralty should make every effort to feed Russia to the full capacity of the ports, on the one condition that a definite tonnage programme and priority arrangement is finally approved and strictly adhered to by the Russian Government. It is worth a great deal of sacrifice to get the vital necessities into Russia, but not to import material of secondary importance.In this connection, the most important statement was made by the Minister of War that he has now insisted in the Council of Ministers that all orders to be placed overseas must be approved by him, and that as soon as he has had time to study outstanding orders he will issue an authoritative order of priority.Russian Output.The conclusions of the Commission pointed time and again to the vital necessity of securing an improvement in the output of Russia&apos;s mines, furnaces, and workshops. To a large extent this is a matter of transport, on which Mr. Bury will report later; but definite recommendations were made with regard to the recall of skilled labour from the colours and to the appointment of an organiser for the Donetz coal area. It is also clearly desirable that latest ideas from the Western Powers should be available in Russia, and the War Department welcomed an exchange of experts. In particular we have undertaken to send out, to Russia one or more representatives, who will be able to explain what has been done in England in the way of economising the use of metals. The Artillery Department is also sending to England an officer to study our methods of amatol filling and the composition of signal lights.It may be remarked here that much good work of this kind has already been done by French experts in Russia, but even more important results of the work of French permanent Mission are indicated in the rapid increase in output in the Moscow area which has been organised by them. Half the total Russian output of 3- inch ammunition is now filled, in a factory erected and run by these French officers. It is important that British munitions officers in Russia should work in closest touch with this Mission, and above all that there may be no divergence in the advice which is pressed upon the Minister of War.Shipping and British Representation in Russia.Reference has already been made to the request of the Minister of War that the British Government should make itself responsible for the despatch to Russia of all British type war material - which should be sent complete with all necessary appurtenances to a British officer in Russia, who would be responsible for handing it over to the authorities in a form in. which it could quickly be made ready for service. It was pointed out that this would involve a duplication of shipping authorities in England, as the Russian Commission would still be responsible for shipping raw materials and other goods. The Minister of War was of opinion that if the British Government wished to take over all shipments, no objection would be raised in Russia if this were done. The duties of the Russian Commission would be limited to dealing with contracts and to acting as the channel through which the Russian Government make known its wishes as regards priority, whether in production or in shipping.This suggestion is intimately connected with the proposals for British repre-sentation in Russia. The Minister of War heartily welcomed the suggestion that the British Minister of Munitions should have an officer in Petrograd who would combine with other duties that of a liaison officer between the Ministry of War and the Ministry
\of Munitions. His organisation should be such as to enable him to advise the British Government on the munition situation in Russia, while he would also be an adviser to the Russian Minister of War.The precise functions of this officer and his relations to General Poole and to the various Departments at home are matters which will require speedy consideration. In this connection, however, it appears that some steps may be required to centralise at home the work of the War Office, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, Treasury, and Commission internationale de Ravitaillement, in dealing with Russian affairs. We have, for example, brought back a very considerable number of documents dealing with various aspects of the munitions problem in Russia; but although all the work of the Mission emphasises the need of dealing with this problem and especially the allocation of transport as a whole, there is no one British Department to whom the information should be handed over.

(Voir plus loin article 14.)[370-2]    .Petrograd, February 17, 1917.Conclusions of the Representatives of the Allies on the Armaments Commission.I. THE representatives of the Allies on the Armaments Commission have examined with the most sympathetic attention the demands put forward by the Russian Government, which they consider to be needed in their entirety.2. It i^, however, necessary to take into account, not merely the restricted capacity of the few ports through which all imports must be brought, and the insufficiency of the means of rail transport from these distant bases to the interior of the country, but also the limited quantity of shipping tonnage which the representatives of Great Britain have indicated will be available. On the whole, it is very improbable that it will be possible ta import into Russia during the current calendar year more than 3,400,000 tons,* although every effort will be made to exceed this figure. Moreover, in view of the increased dangers of navigation, it is quite possible that even this figure may not be reached.In accordance with an arrangement already existing, 120,000 tons out of the total available - must be reserved for Roumanian munitions.3. It is, however, necessary that all supply arrangements should be based on the most favourable hypothesis, and steps taken to send to Russia the maximum possible total. Some excess allowance may even suitably be made for losses and delays in delivery.4. In view of these conditions, it is sug-gested, for the consideration of the Russian Government, that the following allocations should be made among the various classes* Not including- the additional imports which it is hoped will be supplied from Japan.B

(La cession de 60 autres, ainsi que des douilles et fusees, est encore soumise a 1&apos;examen du Gouvernement italien.)D&apos;autres demandes sont encore souniises a 1&apos;examen du Gouvernement italien.6. Le tonnage indique sous la rubrique &quot; Materiel de Chemin de fer :&apos; comprend les quantites qui doivent 6tre livrees d&apos;apres les ordres deja donnes, soit au total 370,000 tonnes des rails.En outre, en raison de 1&apos;urgence d&apos;une augmentation des moyens de transport, les delegues anglais proposeront a leur Gouvernement de placer, si possible, de nouvelles commandes jusqua, concurrence de 100,000 tonnes de materiel roulant et 200,000 tonnes de rails, a livrer dans le dernier Lrimestre de 1917 et a transporter en Russie au debut de 19] 8.7. Les delegues anglais proposeront dgal-ment a leur Gouvernement de prelever sur sespropres ressources et de c,eder a, la Ilussie 4,000 tonnes d&apos;acier a obus par semaine, pendant six mois d&apos;ouverture du port a&quot; Arkhangelsk, sous reserve que la Direc-tion d&apos;Artillerie russe produira avant juin des traces d&apos;obus pour canons russes per-mettant d&apos;utiliser les aciers anglais.Etant donnes les besoins urgents du front russe, ils proposerdnt enfm de commander en Ainerique &apos;110,000 tonnes de ill de fer, a transformer en Ilussie en til barbele\8. Le Gouvernement russe voudra bien indiquer 1&apos;utilisation qui lui paraltra le plus desirable pour le tonnage restant disponible. Toutefois, onpense que 200,000 tonnes pourraient etre reservees aux auto-mobiles de toute nature.II conviendrait alors d&apos;etablir une repar-tition de ces 200,000 tonnes entre les trois pays, France, Grande-Bretange et Italie.. et&quot; de limiter les expeditions de chaque pays, en 1917. a la part qui lui aurait ete attribute.II resterait ensuite 140,000 tonnes dis-ponibles pour les autres besoins. Ce total est inferieur au tonnage necessaire pour le transport des commandes deja en cours. II sera probablement insuffisant pour la quantite des marchandises qui attendront 1&apos;embarquement dans les ports et entrepots(e.) Propellant:30,000 tons in all for the year 1917, including orders already placed.Italy.200 105 millim. guns, delivery to start in March 1917. 40 anti-aircraft guns for the navy. (The cession of 60 more, as well as of cartridge cases and fuses, is still under consideration by the Italian Government.)Other demands are also under considera-tion by the Italian Government.6. The tonnage given under the head of &quot;Railway Material&quot; represents the amount to be delivered on existing orders, including 370,000 tons of rails.In view, however, of the urgent need of increasing the means of transport, the English delegates will recommend their Government to place, if possible, addi-tional orders, up to a total of 100,000 tons of rolling-stock, and 200,000 tons of rails for delivery in the last quarter of 1917, and for transport to Russia at the beginning of 1918.7. The English delegates will also re-commend their Government to cede to Prussia out of its own resources 4,000 tons of shell steel a week during the six months open navigation at Archangel, on condition that the Russian Artillery Department will produce before June a design of shell for use in Russian type guns for which British quality shell steel would be suit-able.Further, in view of the urgent require-ments on the Russian front, they will recommend that 110,000 tons of wire shall be ordered in America to be transformed in Russia into barbed wire.8. The most suitable distribution of the remaining tonnage is a matter for the consideration of the Russian Government. It is, however, suggested that a figure of (say) 200,000 tons should be reserved for motor vehicles of all classes.Further, a division of these 200,000 tons should be made between the three countries, France, Great Britain, and Italy, and shipments from each country during 1917, should be strictly limited to the tonnage allocated to it.If these suggestions are accepted, there would remain 140.000 tons available for all other needs this total is considerably less than the tonnage required to trans-port the goods due on existing orders, and will probably be less than the volume of material which will actually be waiting
lors de la reouverture de la navigation. II n&apos;est done pas opportun de lancer de nouvelles commandes a livrer dans Pannee courante.Toutefois, en raison de linteret tout special qu&apos;il y a a faciliter les transports dans Finterieur du pays et sur le front, les delegues de la Grande-Bretagne propose-ront a leur Gouvernement de placer des commandes pour la livraison immediate de [rrues et autres outillages pour le port a&quot;Arkhangelsk et aussi de harnachement.Les representants allies croient devoir appeler 1&apos;attention du Gouvernement russe sur le danger de 1&apos;encombrement qui se produirait, dans les ports de depart, si des mesures hetaient pas prises pour differer 1&apos;envoi dans ces ports des marchandises qui ne sont pas de premiere urgence.9. Pour que le materiel cede puisse etre mis dans le plus bref delai possible a, la disposition des armees russes, on estime qu&apos;il serait necessaire de reserver le chemin de fer Mourman, jusqu&apos;a la reouverture du port cVArkangelsk, ou transport du materiel d&apos;artillerie, des mortiers de tranchee, des munitions, des poudres et du materiel deviation.II est prudent de prevoir le cas ou le trafic serait interrompu sur une partie de la ligne par suite d&apos;un accident quelconque, et dassurer dans ce cas le transport par traineau dans cette partie. II convient done de rassembler a 1&apos;avance, pour les avoir sous la main en cas de besoin, les traiiieaux, animaux et conducteurs neces-saires.II est d&apos;autre part indispensable de prendre toutes les precautions utiles pour garantir la securite du port de Romanoff et de ees abords, tant centre les accidents a terre que contre les entveprises des sous-niarins ou autres navires ennemis.Enfrn, pour evitcr toute perte de temps, il y aurait interest a ce que les droits de douane soient percus non a Romanoff, mais dans une ville de l&apos;interieur.10. II y a lieu de remarquer que le programme propose ne pourra etre execute &apos;iue si des mesures energiques sont prises sans delai pour assurer dans les meilleures conditions le fonciionnement du port d&apos;Arkhangelsk, qui est actuellement la pi&apos;incipale porte d&apos;entree sur la Russie.A ce propos, on considere comme tout a fait indispensable de militariser, avant la i&apos;eouverture de la navigation, le personnel du port charge&quot; des manutentiens a terre et du chargement des trains.11. Le tonnage maximum preVu ne pourra etre realise&quot; que si les navires sont retenus le moins longtemps possible dans [370-2]shipment at the ports, or in warehouses: when navigation opens; it is, therefore, clearly undesirable that any new orders should be placed for delivery during the current year.In view, however, of the special import-ance of facilitating transport both into Russia and on the Eastern front, the British delegates will recommend their Government to place orders for immediate delivery of cranes and other equipment needed in the port of Archangel, and also for harness.The allied representatives desire to call the attention of the Russian Government to the danger of congestion which will be produced at the ports of embarcation unless measures are taken to prevent the despatch to the ports of goods of secondary importance.9. In order that the munitions ceded to Russia may be put at the disposal of the armies with the least possible delay, it is considered essential that until the opening of Archangel the Murman Railway shall be entirely reserved for the transport of guns and howitzers, trench mortars, ammu-nition, propellant, and avia,tion material.In view of the possibility that traffic may be interrupted by an accident on some part of the line it is desirable to make provision for sledge transport. For this purpose an adequate supply of sledges, animals and drivers, should be immediately mobilised, so as to be ready in case of emergency.It is further essential to take all possible precautions to guarantee the safety of the port of Romanoff and its environment,, both against accidents on land and against attacks from submarine and other enemy vessels.Finally, to prevent congestion and less of time at the port, it is suggested that the customs should be levied, not at Romanoff itself, but at some town in the interior.10. It is to be observed that the pro-gramme proposed can only be carried out if energetic measures are taken without delay to assure that suitable conditions of work prevail at the port of Archangel, which is actually the chief gateway into Russia.For this purpose it is considered abso-lutely essential that, before the opening of navigation, the shore labour handling general cargo should be put under a military regime.11. The maximum shipping tonnage indicated can only be supplied if ships are retained fer the minimum  possible
les ports. Ace point de vue, une nouvelle difficulte surgira, en 1917, a Arkhangelsk, en raison de la ndcessite dexporter au moms 500,000 tonnes de ble\II est done de la plus haute importance de preparer ^nergiquement et sans retard cette derniere operation, en commencant des maintenant la construction des quais, magasins, &amp;c.12. A cause de Timpossibilite d&apos;importer tout le charbon et lacier qui font defaut a la Russie, il est essentiel que sa production propre soit augmentee, en 1917, par tous les moyens possibles. Dapres les ren-seignements recueillis, on est d&apos;avis que les grandes mines pourraient produire plus de charbon si Ton mettait a leur disposition le personnel specialiste necessaire qu&apos;il faudrait rappsler du front a cet effet. On obtiendrait une amelioration immediate de la situation en concentrant dans la main d&apos;un seul chef, energique et actif, la re-partition des charbons dans la region du Sud, et la distribution des wagons pour leur transport.13. La penurie des metaux oblige aussi a en supprimer 1&apos;emploi dans les industries qui n&apos;ont aucun rapport avec la guerre. De m6me, dans la fabrication du materiel de guerre et des munitions, il est indis-pensable d&apos;user de tous les proced&amp;s propres a dconomiser le metal.14. II semble que les ressources du Japon, en ce qui caicerne les munitions, n&apos;aient pas ete utilisees aussi largement qu&apos;il exit 6te possible. On suggere que les Gouvemements allies representes a la Con-fCrence fassent une demarche aupres du Gouvernement japonais pour lui demander d&apos;organiser ses ressources en vue de fournir a la Russie poudres, acier, cuivre, materiel de chemiu de fer et munitions confec-tionnees.Si le Gouvernement japonais se chargeait de 1&apos;organisation des transports par mer et de la fourniture de wagons et de locomo-tives, il en resulterait un supplement de materiel appreciable.  -15. Si le Gouvernement russe pensait que la mise a sa disposition d&apos;ingeiiieurs ou autres experts put favoriser le develop-pement de sa production, ses Allies de 1&apos;Ouest seraient heureux de lui donner satisfaction sur ce point.] 6. Les represeutants allies tiennent a exprimer leur reconnaissance pour le tres obligeant empressement avec lequel le Gouvernement russe leur a fourni tous jes renseignements demandes.length of time at the port; in this con-nection a new difficulty will arise, in 1917, at Archangel, from the necessity of export-ing at least 500,000 tons of wheat.It is, therefore, of the first importance that prompt and energetic steps shall be taken for facilitating this operation, and that the necessary berths, warehouses, &amp;c , should be immediately taken in hand.12. In view of the impossibility of iui-porting all the coal and steel which Russia requires, it is essential that her own pro-duction should be increased, in 1917, by all possible means. From information received, it is thought that more coal could be pro-duced from, the mines if they could obtain further skilled labour, which would have to be recalled from the Army for the purpose. An immediate improvement in the situation would also be obtained by the appointment of an. energetic and active officer, who would have supreme control of the distri-bution of coal in the reo-ion of the South, and of the allocation of waeffons for itsCOtransport.13. The scarcity of metals makes it necessary to suppress their use in indus-tries that have no direct connection with the war. On the other hand, it is also essential to introduce all possible devices for economising metal in the manufacture ol&apos; guns, ammunition, and other war material.14. It appears that the munition pro-ducing resources of Japan have not hitherto beeu utilised to the fudest possible extent. Ic is recommended that the Allied Govern-ments represented at the Conference should put before the Japanese Govern-ment the necessity of organising its resources in order to provide Russia with propellant, steel, copper, railway material, and completed munitions.If the Japanese Government would undertake the organisation of transport by sea, and could find means of supplying a certain number of waggons and loco-motives, it might be possible to make a considerable addition to the quantity of munitions that could be imported into Russia as indicated above15. If the Russian Government is of opinion that the development of its output could be increased by engineering or other expert assistance, the Western Allies would be glad to aid them in this respect.16. The Allied delegates wish to express their appreciation of the readiness which has been shown by the Russian Government in supplying them with all necessary information.
