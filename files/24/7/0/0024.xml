Report of the Meeting of the 27th January.

The result of this meeting, which was attended by the naval Authorities who gave valuable and whole-hearted assistance by way of constructive criticism, may be briefly summarised as follows:-

(1) The Committee were strongly impressed by the extraordinary strength obtained with the wood and piano wire construction used in the girder they saw tested.

(2) The form of the ship was not considered an obstacle in the manufacture or use.

(3) The three tiers of gas bags were considered a practical solution of the difficulty of the manufacturing of a ship of similar dimensions in the Zeppelin lines.

(4) It was not considered that helicopter screws were desirable for changing the direction of the ship vertically, and the Committee insisted that it would be necessary for suitable elevators to be provided. Further, the ?wivelling of the propellers was not considered feasible for the steering of the ship in a horizontal  plant, and rudders would have to be provided.

(5) The position of the propellers were criticised both from the point of view of the freedom of wake and the danger that one propeller breaking might have on another. It was agreed that it would be easy to distribute the propellers in a suitable manner around the structure.

(6) The petrol electric drive was considered, and many points in its favour were advanced and agreed to. The two chief points against it were weight and the danger of having electrical connections on board a ship filled with hydrogen from the gas bags of which leakage might occur

(7) The question of filling the gas bags and their behaviour in the ship should any abrupt change of position occur was advanced as a deterrent, and it was later suggested experiments should be tried on this point.

(8) The construction of the airship shed, and the form and clearance of the ship in same, were discussed, and objections raised.

(9) The utility of a ship of such large dimensions was brought up, and the Committee felt that the greatest service such a ship could render at the present time would be the scouting over large areas, and for long periods, such as the work it could do over the Atlantic, watching the passage of ships, reporting the locality of submarines or commerce-destroyers.

Dealing with the objections raised, elevators and rudders can be easily fixed, and the designs are now being prepared to meet this point.
It should be quite practicable to suitably ventilate all engine rooms and places containing electrical switchgear so that there should be no danger from hydrogen explosion.

The simplicity of control of, and the case of driving propellers by, the petrol electric system seem to outweigh the disadvantages. It would seem possible to so construct and attach the ballonettes to the framework of the balloons in their compartments should be obviated, as also the creasing of the ballon in its support should be capable of being preverted. Designs are being prepared to overcome these difficulties, and experiments should be made.

Talking all the points together, I am of opinion:

That the work should be proceeded with.

That the amended designs should be submitted to the Admiralty for their consideration and criticism.

That the petrol electric drive should be proved out.

That experiments with the construction and attachment of the ballonets in the chambers should be immediately proceeded with, but at the same time if the Navy consider an airship of this size would be of value - (which to a layman appears enormous) -- in scouting over large areas such as the Atlantic, work should be commenced on the construction of the airship shed, the main girders for the airship and the preparation of a land station, in order that no time may be lost on the completion of the suggested experiments, and an airship of these large dimensions and consequent power placed at the disposal of the nation.
