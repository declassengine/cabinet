COLONEL W. DALLYsecret.0. 1/88/257Copy No.w.c. 91/10.JOINT NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF AND ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF ON THE VALUE OF SPAIN AS AN ALLY,1. the population of spain, exclusive of her african possessions, is about 21 millions.military service is compulsory from the age of .22 to the age of 34. the total strength of a years class is about 200,000, of whom about 140,000 are available for service.the spanish army on a war footing would probably total about 300,000 men, organized in 14 divisions. in addition there is a reserve of about 180,000 trained or partly trained men, whom it is proposed to organize into 116 battalions, 14 cavalry regiments, 27 field batteries and 14 mountain batteries. as, however, it is reported by our military attache, that the total number of rifles in spain is not more than 380,000, and as the reserve of field guns is equal only to the formation of the 27 field batteries mentioned above, it is unlikely that more than 14 divisions could be mobilized.the total war strength of the spanish army appears to be as under : 	Officers.	Men.	Horses.	Field.	Heavy.	Mountain.1st Line 2nd Line 3rd Line	7,839 3,088	291,820 137,814 53,000	36	444 108	30	124 84Total        ......	10;927	482,634	36	552	30*	208* Old pattern 15 cm. guns.,2. the above table shows the great shortage that exists of heavy guns. it may in fact be said that spain possesses no modern heavy guns or howitzers, though 2 batteries of 15 cm. guns are being constructed at trubia, and that if she were to enter the war the whole of her heavy artillery must be supplied by her allies.the number of field guns, as will be seen from the table, is about 550, of which about 100 are old pattern. at present 24 field guns are allotted to each division, but it is hoped to raise the number to 36 per division. these guns are 75 mm. schneiders, and the factories at trubia, seville and cadiz have an annual output of about 25 batteries (100 guns).3. spain is unable to produce at present any considerable quantity of gun ammu-nition. her only military shell factory is at trubia, where the maximum output of the existing works does not exceed 20,000 field gun shell per week. there is also a naval shell factory near cadiz. its output is unknown, but is certainly inferior to that of trubia. The reserve of gun ammunition is believed to be low.the reserve of s.a.a. probably does not exceed 100,000,000 rounds. the factories at seville and toledo probably have a combined output of 200,000 rounds a day.4. there is a great want of machine guns. there are a few hotchkiss pattern in morocco, and 50 colts have been obtained from the u.s.a., but have been found unsatisfactory.transport of all kinds appears to be almost entirely lacking, and generally speaking the equipment of the troops is bad.there are few, if any, serviceable aeroplanes with the army.5. the spanish soldier is very good material, hardy, frugal and requiring few of the luxuries considered necessary by other european armies, but he is badly trained and badly led. the officers, and especially the seniors are, generally speaking, indifferent.6. the spanish army may well be compared with that of roumania, but spain has two great advantages over roumania : the first that she is not in direct contact(B17/212)   50  3/17   H&amp;S   4294wo
with enemy territory, and consequently she cannot be overrun, and her troops need not be engaged before they have been properly trained and equipped. The second advantage is that Spain contains richer mineral resources than any other European country, and consequently if time were available to develop these resources and to expand the existing factories, she is capable not merely of providing all her own munition requirements, but also of furnishing large supplies to her Allies. She is also in direct land connection with France, and consequently no shipping is required to exploit her resources.7. To sum up, it may be said that the result of bringing Spain into the war would be to augment the forces of the Entente by about half a million trained or partially trained men, with a reserve of some 4 or 5 million untrained men of military age behind them. Owing to the inefficiency of the senior officers, it would be difficult to convert this material&apos; into a reliable fighting force capable of opposing German troops. The armies which might be formed would require to be supplied from abroad with the greater part of their equipment and with all their heavy artillery. She would also require heavy financial assistance. On the other hand, she can provide unlimited supplies of high grade iron ore, copper and wolfram, and her large population should furnish much labour. There is, however, very little coal in Spain, and consequently much would have to be imported.8. The Spanish Fleet consists of: -2 small modern battleships.1 small battleship, 30 years old.4 cruisers, all old.3 light cruisers, all old.6 small destroyers.Some 17 torpedo boats, a few gunboats and auxiliaries, and 1 submarine, built in the United States and now on passage to Cadiz.If Spain were to intervene on the side of the Allies her naval resources would best be employed in organizing a patrol of torpedo vessels and small craft to act against enemy submarines in the vicinity of her coasts. The force, however, would be very weak in proportion to the coast line. Her larger vessels would be no value to the Allied Fleets.9. The advantages from a naval point of view of Spanish intervention would be the following: (i.) Spanish ports in the Peninsula, in the Balearic Islands and in the Canary Islands, could be used as refuges for Allied ships and as bases for patrols, but the majority of these ports would require to be supplied with submarine defences. Las Palmas, in the Canaries, would also be useful as a coaling station.(ii.) It- will be possible to net and patrol waters&apos; in the Straits of Gibraltar atpresent neutral.   This will be of use should the enemy desire to passsubmarines in and out of the Mediterranean, (iii.) It will be possible to exercise the right of visit and search of neutral vessels.This is, however, of small importance under existing circumstances, (iv.) The coast of the Spanish zone in Morocco might be better supervized againstthe secret operations of submarines in landing arms, &amp;c.    This wouldprincipally affect the French, (v.) Portuguese and Spanish troops could proceed to France by land, thus freeingdestroyers and transports, and avoiding the use of the dangerous sea route.10. On the other hand, Spanish intervention would, from a naval point of view, have certain grave disadvantages. At the present time, in view of the activity of enemy submarines, the protection afforded by neutral territorial waters is of great value. British merchant vessels are at present taking advantage of Spanish waters, particularly in the Mediterranean, and by so doing are avoiding the risk of being destroyed. If Spain were to intervene, our merchant vessels would no longer be immune from attack in these waters.Moreover, in addition to this disadvantage, Spanish intervention would necessitate our building up and maintaining an auxiliary patrol service, and providing anti-submarine nets and defences for Spanish ports, thus involving a further call upon the United Kingdom for vessels, guns and material.   It is difficult to estimate the extent
of these demands, but they would undoubtedly be heavy, and, considering the present difficulty in meeting our urgent needs, it would be beyond our power to meet themfully. r     .     .     .11. From the foregoing it will be seen that Spanish intervention on the side of the Entente Powers would, from the military point of view, be of some advantage both on account of her mineral resources, the labour she might provide, and the reinforcements she might supply to our armies, although the latter would be very limited in numbers, and it would be a considerable time before any substantial benefit could be derived either from them or from the mineral wealth of the country. Moreover, the development and employment of these resources would involve further heavy demands upon our own.From the naval point of view the advantages, of Spanish intervention are on the whole outweighed by the disadvantages. &quot; -(Signed)      J.
