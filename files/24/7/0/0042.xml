I have read the amendment, and I consider that it will be understood by&apos;tho Arab nationalist  arty to &quot;mean that Baghdad is to bo a part of the Indian Empire, a prospect which would bo abhorrent to them for a variety of reasons.!The Arab is above&quot; all proud, lie docs not want favours panting him.      If we desire to get on with the Arabs we must not patronize but we must be firm.The differonce between the two paragraphs is this, the original paragraph, if properly translated, will mean &quot;If you support us you will be- our equals in internal, affairs, which you rail manage yourselves, if you do not we. have. a.free hand&quot; - The amendment means &quot;\/hether you. behave well or ill -we^shall, give you good treatment, but we shall settle. ymal^aiTTairs^jfor you&quot; 0I am certain if we take the line of trying to xulejx&amp;bs^&apos; as we rule Indians we shall fail.     We sha^X-Jlntroduce the social colour distinction and antagonise the T^Qle^AJtrai^-mcry^v.^ ment; we shall have the intellectuals against us from the very start, and it is the intellectuals who will rule public opinion when peace comes,,For the moment &apos;0r.ghdad is probably a stricken deserted city, and the proclamation will have little local effect, but the influence of the proclamation in iiyria, Mesopotamia and Arabia, will I make no doubt be very greata     lurther it will force the hands of the French.,. M* Picot sincerely desires to work the Arab state, but he has repeatedly told me of theopposition to which he is subjected, by colonial expansionists.   .        ........ ..who only desire to impose dominion by force on the Arabs.If wo set iip autoniony as our ideal wo get the sympathyof every Arab nationalist, we make it almost impossible fortho French to go&apos; in for forcible dominion, and we pave theway...   - -:.
way for a better state of thing? in Egypt.      If we offer benefits in a &quot;white man!s burden&quot; tone of voice we pave the way for discontent, and a coalition between the Arabic speaking Egyptian Nationalists and the ;!Lrab intellectuals, Sur path is beset with dangers; if we are courageous, we have every prospect of being supreme in region B, and beloved in region A.   If we do not play up  0 Arab racial pride in Baghdad then we shall make Baghdad a restless appanage instead of a centre of influence.Baghdad is a natural capital of practically all the inhabited areas of region B.    If we make it an Arab capital we shall control the -Arabs, because we&quot; shall control Baghdad commercially, and by Clause 6 we dan maintain troops there.Baghdad will be a centre of education and civilization for all the Arabic speaking world; if it is restless, hostile, or sullen, our influence will wane;    if it is friendly our influence will war.   It will never accept our open dominion, but if we play our cards properly by means of &quot;aCrisers&quot; instead of &quot;rulers&quot; and back Ar-*to nationalism, we shall have a permanent footing at little oust.The Arab ideal has been lecal autonomy ever since the constitution of 1900, it is the desire for local autonomy which has had such disastrous results for the Turks.     There is much in a name, the Arabs will not object to the presence of. British troops and a British General; British advisers ?nd British merchants, but they will never endure either the idea cf a British Governor-General, or an outwardly British direct controlled civil service.Further it must he remembered that the Turks neverdenied the Arabs either social equality or executive power.PicId-Marshal Mahmud Shefket, Oommander-in-Ohief of theTurkish Army, was. a Baghdadi and virtually an Arab, Izzctthe great 2nd Secretary of Abdul Hamid was a damascene,that

It is impossible to approach a people with an intellectual class which has produced men who have held such offices in the same spirit as one might approach tribesmen or natives who accept Hufopcan superiority as a matter of course,[Che political conditions and possibilities in the area between Exit and Kerkuk are entirely different to the conditions between 2ut and Basra,     Tho Southern area is a country which has relapsed inio complete barbarism and anarchy, and is inhabited practically by savages with no intellectual class, and I am pretty sure the ,lrab nationalist party would bo glad to seo us rule it,        he northern area has been the centre of organised Government from time immemorial, and has sent an annual quota to the military and civil service schools and consequently has in peace time a large intellectual class. Tho members of th^Sclass are it is true scattered, and terri-fied, but it is of the greatest importance to demonstrate to*then that their ideals are not contrary to ours&quot;, and to leave tho door open for them to come in on our side without loss of dignity.   Of courso everything depends on our capacity to hold Baghdad, and it will require some considerable period of occu-pation to prove this to people ?;ho will remember that the Arab leaders who took our part at ICut were hanged, and that though we exchanged prisoners with the Turfcs we were unable to protect those who had taken our side,(Initialled)     H.S.
