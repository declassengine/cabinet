A prompt settlement of the situation is necessary.2.     Work on munitions is naturally disorganised.3.

Army is somewhat unsettled, though there is everyintention on the part of new Government to continuethe war.5. .The Socialist anti-war party must be stopped in the bud. 6.     Germans must be shewn at the earliest possible momentthat it is the intention of Russia to continue war. 7.     No time could be lost through discussion with diplo-matic authorities. 8.     I was and still am prepared to take any blame whichmay arise  rom my action. 9.     I acted in conjunction with Alexieff and Grand DukeSerge who sent for me to discuss the situation, 10.
