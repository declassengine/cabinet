3 CAB?ft^HJU Office of Works, etc., for the Weekending 10th March, 1917,(l)     The Restricted Occupations Order issued by the Ministry of Munitions, on behalf of the Director of. National Services, under the Defence of the Realm Act, has been received during the week.     The trades dealt with in the schedule to the Order are the trades with which the business of, the Office of Works is principally concerned and the provision that in such trades new men between the ages of 18, and 81 are not to be taken into employment without the prior consent of the Director of National Services is likely to hamper most seriously the war work of the Department.     A communication has accordingly been addressed to the Director of National Services pointing out to him that the Department itself is best able to judge what men are required to carry out its work and that the proper course is to appoint an Officer of the Department to be a Commissioner for National Service in respect of the Department&apos;s Contractors(2)     The Hampstead Joint War Production Committee has been informed that the Board are prepared, subject to the consent of, the Ganeral Officer Commanding, London District (as to which no difficulty is expected) to allot about 6 acres in Primrose Hill to be cultivated as allotments.     A rent of  2, per acre: all cost to be met by the Committee: resumption on two months1 noticeat
at the end of any year? tenancy in any case to expire at the same time as-, the Order in respect of waste lands issued by the Board of Agriculture *(3)     Two blocks constructed for the Ministry of Munitions in the gardens of Montagu House have been finished and are in occupation.(4)     The applications for further accommodation for Government Departments have continued as, numerous as ever.     The main questions have been:-(a) Proposal to requisition the whole of ChurchHouse in Dea^s lard for the Australian Headquarters staff.(b) The need of finding further space for theAir Board, how housed in the Hotel Cecil.(c) The accommodation of the new Directorateof Pood Production in Bridgewater House in respect of which Lord Bllesmere has made proposals so reasonable as to obviate the necessity of requisitioning.(d) The interchange of accommodation between theExplosives Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions and the Employment Department of the Labour Ministry, both of which are housed in Queen1Anne1s Chambers, Westminster.(e)The settlement a&amp; to what use is to be made of the fresh accommodation which will be available in the New Public Offices Extension, Whitehall, which is expected to be complete by the end of the month.The last question will involve a -somewhatextensive series of changes affecting Public Officesboth in this block and in the Colonial Office andForeign Office Block.(E)
(5)     The Defence of the Realm Losses Commission has during the week settled the compensation claim in respect of the Strand Ho*use premises which were under construction for Messrs.

The eempensation claim was at the rate of  25,030, and the amount allowed is  12,175 per annum: and various other minor reductions have also been secured,(S)     A draft of the new Bill dealing with the powers and procedure of the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission has been received and reported on. If passed in anything Like its present shape this Bill will be of the utmdst value in dealing with such a case as De Keyserfs Hotel where difficulty would otherwise be anticipated owing to the determination of the Receiver to proceed by way of Petition of Right.(7)     The qnestion of making use of the Grand Committee room in the House of Commons has been considered,(8)     The difficulties as regards the supply of labour for munition jobs are still serious and there is reason to suppose that they will be accentuated as a result of the Mational ServiceVolunteer
Voluiiteer Scheme which offers incentives to men working away from home to leave their work and obtaiia the enhanced subsistence allowance admissibleunder It he scheme./(9.)     A considerable number of additions to buildings under construction for the Ministry of Munitions have been requested during the we,ek and the Department has been requested to put up a new store at Birmingham at an estimated cost of  35,000: to carry out a scheme of house construction for the Fire Brigade staff at the National Filling Factory, Morecambe, at. an estimated cost of  12,000; and to proceed with a new Rectifying Factory at Waltham. The Army Ordnance Department Stores at Ahbey Wood (estimated cost  16,750) have been completed.(10)     The First Commissioner of Works has completed a survey of the entire staff of the Department with the object of releasing men for military service.     The number of men still remaining, fit for military service, is very limited, but it is proposed, subject fed substitution, to release some thirty men.
