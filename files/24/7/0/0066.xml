AmBilleting of Civilians Bill.MEMORANDUM.Difficulty has been experienced in finding lodgings for munition workers, and in many cases where large works have been established the rent of lodgings has been run up to a prohibitive figure. The difficulties are likely to be accentuated in the future when accommodation has to be found for workers on the land and the substitutes provided under the national service scheme. There is also danger, unless the action of the different Government departments concerned is co-ordinated, that one department will compete against another in their anxiety to provide accommodation for the workers with whom they are respectively concerned. It is also desirable that Departments should be in a position to ensure the welfare of the workers, especially women workers, who are employed onIt has been thought not desirable to apply the provisions as to billeting contained in the Army Act. Those provisions are worked through the police, who are not considered suitable agents in the case of the workers with whom the departments referred to are concerned, the majority of whom will be women; and lodging-house keepers Avould, not unnaturally, resent the stigma which attaches to police visits.The Bill therefore proposes to set up entirely fresh machinery. For this purpose a Central Board is constituted consisting of representatives of the departments concerned. In view of the fact that most of the workers to be lodged will be women, it is proposed that at least two of the members of the Board shall be women.The Board will act through local organisations, and for this purpose it may either use existing organisations, such as welfare committees, war agricultural committees, &amp;c, or set up special organisations for the purpose. The local committees will be assisted by executive officers appointed by the Board. Here, again, it may be found possible to utilise the services ofnational work and to see that the board and lodging are suitable.42-3a

[7 Geo. 5.]existing officers, such as medical officers of health or labour exchange officers.The local committees will ascertain what accommodation is available and allocate the persons to be billeted amongst the various lodgings, but the Bill makes provision for requiring that persons shall- be billeted only on persons who are willing to receive them before resort is had to compulsion.A person billeted will be required to pay for board, lodging, and attendance on such- scale as may be fixed by the local committee, the scale being fixed within such maxima and minima limits as may be settled by the Board. He will be required, except in special cases (e.g., agricultural workers), to give a week&apos;s notice, or payment in lieu of notice, before quitting his billet, and to pay what is due from him by way of board and lodging. He will also have to pay compensation for any damage to premises or the contents thereof which he may have caused. If the person billeted fails to make the proper payments the local committee will make them on his behalf,, and recover them by a summary process from him. To facilitate such recovery, deductions from his future wages may be ordered by the court, following the precedent of the Munitions of War Acts. The person providing lodgings will thus have an absolute protection against bad debts.Any complaints by a person billeted against the person on whom he is billeted, or vice versa, will be referred to the committee, who will endeavour to settle such disputes, and will, if necessary, remove the person billeted to other quarters. There will, however, be cases where the misbehaviour of the person billeted is such that he should be forthwith. removed from the premises (e.g., where he is violent or guilty of gross immorality or drunkenness). In these cases he can be arrested without warrant and taken to a police station.The position of the War Office is safeguarded, so as to prevent the whole of the accommodation being taken up in places where soldiers may require to be billeted.No one is liable to have an enemy subject billeted on him.
