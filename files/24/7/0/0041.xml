-Gifcailated by the Secretary of State for India.from viceroy, foreign department, 4th march 1917.Secret. Mahsuds. Large armed gathering under Mullah Fazl Din collected near Sarwekai. He is said to have letter signed by Nasrulla Khan urging Mahsuds to unite and rise, and promising help from Kabul. This is possibly forgery. If genuine, we feel sure it was sent without Amir&apos;s cognisance. Fazl Din is obviously anxious to establish his position in tribe by signal act of hostility to Government, and is taking advantage of temper of hostile sections. On 1st March some shots were fired at Sarwekai; and ^ telegraph cut. At night party of militia went out and occupied positions vacated by Mahsuds, and inflicted considerable loss on Mahsuds returning in morning. Militia lost one sepoy killed. Later, however, Mahsuds apparently attacked in force. Our losses were : killed] 1 British officer, Major F. L. Hughes, 2 jemadars, 13 sepoys, missing,&apos; taken prisoners, 18 sepoys; seriously wounded, 7 sepoys ; Necessary military precautions are being taken. Two aeroplanes have arrived at Tank. Derajat Moveable Column reaches Murtaza to-day, and 44th Brigade is being-sent from Rawal Pindi to Tank.from viceroy, foreign department, 7th march 1917. (Received at India Office, 7 p.m.)Secret. Mahsuds. Our telegram of the 4th instant. Mahsud reports admit 25 killed. On the 4th, Jandola was sniped all day without damage. Sarwekai is surrounded but confident of holding out. Movable column reached Nili Kach on 6th ; latest report says that Mullahs have gone to Khaisora probably for reinforcements, leaving 2,000 Mahsuds round Sarwekai, and that of the captured sepoys, nine have been sent to Kabul. Mahsuds reported preparing to oppose Movable Column.We have addressed Amir asking him to prevent his subjects from joining with Mahsuds.
