MINISTRY OF PENSICBS.Report for Period from the 3rd March to the 9th March.sj&amp;JI The principal matter that concerned the Ministryl^lHAtLMB^he week was the debate on the Drafts of the RoyalWarrant and Order.in Council.for the pensions tf Soxdiers and Sailors disabled and cf the Families and-Dependants cf Soldiers and Sailors deceased.     This took place on the 6th instant when the supplementary estimate for the Ministry for the balance cf the current financial year came up for consideration in Committee-       Mr. Barnes initited the debate with a statement cf the steps- that were being taken in connection with the treatment and training of the disabled man and a full explanation cf the contents nf the Warrant and Order.    It was closed by Sir Arthur Grif f Ith-Boscawen&apos;s reply to the criticisms of various numbers On the Documents that were -before thorn. These criticisms, roughly analysed in Appendix I hereto, were mainly favourable but there was, a very-general opinion in the House that the treatment and training; of disabled men were not yet on a satisfactory basis such as &quot;would prevent the Country hereafter having a not-inconsiderable number of its people with their powers to add to its wealth and to their own well&apos; being unnecessarily restricted.,   Much stress was laid.by. a few members on the right to a pension of every man invalided out of the Army, no matter what was the length cr character if his service, but the general feeiing of the Hou.se did not support the view that where a man was ill when he was passed into the Army and did no service in it he should be more generously treated than was proposed in the Draft Warrant.     The right of a widow to a pension whatever her character or that of her husband1s service was mentioned as well as the right of a man to sue for his pension, but these points were not pressed.
A matter on which more stress was laid was the limit toseven years of the period during which disablement might be held to be in consequence of the war and a promise was made that the removal of the limit should be considered.The power to make half of a man&apos;s pension dependent on his undergoing the treatment adjudged necessary to him was generally approved on the understanding that the provision in the Warrant giving the power should be sympathetically administered. 4rn15bThere was some discussion of the circumstances in . which a parent could receive a pension and a promise was made to make the intention of the Warrant clearer in this respect.The Supplementary Estimate passed through Committee but a promise was made that a future opportunity for the discussion of the new pension provisions should be afforded in the Report stage to be taken on the 12th instant.2..   Progress was made by the Committees drawing up theregulations and instructions under which the Warrant forsoldiers and Order in Council for sailors are to be administeredand a meeting of the Minister&apos;s statutory advisers is to beheld tomorrow, the 10th instant, to consider the principlesto govern alterations in the Warrants and Orders in Councilgoverning the pensions to officers of the Army and Navy and       ;their families and to nurses. The5. / Naval and Military Far Pensions etc.  (Administrative Expenses) Bill has been the subject of considerable further discussion.     A deputation was received by the Minister on the 7th instant from the Municipal Corporations r Association on the subject, and the County Councils&apos; Association are submitting suggestions.     The main principle of the Bill, that of joint contribution towards the Expenses of Local Committees, is not now seriously contested, and the suggestions made have been mainly in the direction of(a) making more liberal provision for Local.autonomy by the freer establishment of Local Committees(b) defining by some standard what the reasonable expenses of a. Local Committee should be.Both points are being carefully considered.
The second reading of the bill is down for the 13th instant 4.    A report of the Statutory Committee giving details of the work done by them In the week is annexed as Appendix II. Treatment schemes for Buckinghamshire, Luton and Edinburgh have been conditionally approved.     A training scheme for Swindon has also been approved conditionally, and one for Luton is being considered.5.    The Joint Committee for    Institutional Treatment held a meeting on the 5th :ilarch, when Sir John Collie made a report on Golders Green (for neurasthenics) and Dr. Bond one on Chalfont St. Giles (for Epileptics).      In both cases it appeared that difficulty had arisen with regard to proceeding with the buildings, and representations are to be made to the Minister of Munitions in the matter.     Suggestions for other institutions for Epileptics were discussed.     Dr. Hartly reported on the nature of the provision required for Tuberculous cases and on the suitability of Claremont for the purpose.
6.        The Memorandum ch Arrangements for the treatment, and training of Disabled Soldiers submitted to the Prime Minister on the 5th February had appended to it a return of discharged ?! arrant Officers,. N*C*0.&apos;s and men disabled through the war with Germany up to the 31st December last, showing the various causes of disablement.     Similar returns for the months of January and February wore ar,;onc1^4 as Tables I and II to this Report.     The return to the 31st January shows that there were 5,155 cases of men dis-charged in which there had been amputation.     By that date. 6,827 artificial limbs had been supplied or were on order, a number of these having been furnished to men not yet discharged,     6,022 undischarged men had had limbs amputated but had not yet been fitted for artificial limbs.     8*7 of them were ready to be so fitted,7.        Table III shows that 10,542 pensions (including cAldrens allowances) were granted during the week against 8,417 during the previous week and that 538,270 have been awarded from the commencement of the war up to the 7th instant.       Table IV shows that during the last week 177 grants of supplementary pensions and temporary allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 170 In the previous week and that the to.ta.1 up to date (correcting some errers in previous reports) is 1884. 8. A Domorandum, submitted to the Prime ginister onthe &apos;5th Februa.ry, showed that the staff of the Ministry of Pensions at the date cf the transfer to that Ministry of the powers and duties of other authorities in connection with disablement pensions, numbered 2296 and consisted of 221 men and 2075 women.     As will be seen from Table IV it now numbers 2,444 and consists of 193 men and ( ,25I women, the decrease in men being due to the Ministry net taking over some 2nd Division and Soldier Clerks, from theCommissioners
March, 1917.Commissioners of Chelsea. Hospital, and tiie increase, in women to necessary provision in the award &quot;branches to meet the additional work which will follow the en..,ct-ment 01 the now Royal  arrant and Order in Council.
Appendix 1*DEBATE CF THE HOUSE OF COMHONS ON PENSIONS VkfiRPNT.March 6th 1917.The whole tone of the debate was most cordial both to the Minister and. to the scheme.     Sir Charles Nicholson praised the admirable clarit^ of the speech, &quot;Though I have sat in this house g pood many years, I do not think I have ever known a subject more clearly and admirably explained&quot;.     Mr. Hogge (J?74) , by far the most hostile critic, used the words &quot;Even this Warrant good, as it is etc.&quot;     Sir Henry Norman (276), pointed out. that the English rates proposed &quot;are practically double those in force in France&quot;.-     T&quot;&apos;r. Clynes (278, said &quot;An immense improvement.      It places the whole question of pensions, and allowances in a position of far greater simplicity, fairness and equality than ever before&quot;.      Captain Owynn (296), &quot;it enable^ us to look disabled men in the face when ve meet them in the streets&quot;.      Hr:.. Harris  (299), &quot;The defect of the old system was its uncertainty and. it seemed based on the principle that the more a man did for himself the less would the state do for him.      The.new warrant changes all that&quot;. Er. Hohler (31.2) said &quot;It is as light compared with the dark ages&quot;.      Sir J. Malton (334), noted the great advantage in abolition of the flat rate which was unfair, e.g.-, to miners who earned  3 to  5 a week as against agricultural labourers,The discussion ranged over a variety of detail, and the leading criticisms are here summarised.1).    Medical Treatment, and ^raining.Sir Henry Norman (277 said that the Prench are in advance of us;    in Prance a much larger proportion of
disahled nen will return to industrlal life and grow steadilybetter off, whereas an English disabled man who does notbecome re-educated will become steadily poorer as hischildren grow up.     He desires to retain men under militarydiscipline till trained, and thinks the bonus Inducementlikely to be ineffectual.     He considers evarv medicalcentre of treatment should have a training school attachedwhoseto deal with men ^feamztke period of medical treatment will bo only half an hour per day.Mr. Clvnes  (2.88) observed that at. present, there were really neither apparatus, nor schools, nor centres for the necessary training.     Kir Charles Nicholson (292) agreed that the bonus was a very inadequate Inducement but he was against the system of fines.      Ho indicated the need of organisation for keeping in touch w1th discharged men and putting them in communication with local committees.V-r. Harris asked whether a local commit tee- could give a man a course of training and pa-r him allowance, or must each man bo certified by the- central body.     He considered the present means o1&apos; local committees for prov-din^ for health and training quite inadequate, and pointed out that no penal condition could be imposed unless you provided the institutions necessary for treatment.      The / rmy should give more informs -tion to men about, to be discharged as to the opportunities &apos; for treatment and trainlog, &quot;Not a man now knows that the local committees could maintain them and their wives and. families while they are under treatment or training&quot;. Nothing   could be really successful in this country without prop a g a nd a w o r k..Sir George Toulmin pointed out that organisation is developing under the lead of the &apos;^miistry
-o -of Pensions, yet that at present man are slipping out of the proposed training because it is not, there for them.     These Fill drift into canuel labourers -     Sir G. Toulmtn asked whether mohev deducted from pensions because a nan Is supported- from public funds vould go to the institutions where he is supported.      &apos;r.  Pennefether (326) also developed this point.     Sir George Toulmin also favoured an appeal, when medical treatment is ordered as a condition of pension.     He argued that for consumpt ives the T^inistrrr mist ha^e their own sanatoria and farm colonies.In reply sir /.G. Boscavan admitted that much more must be done.     This was a most important branch of the Ministry&apos;s work.      He said &quot;)rfe are taking ever&quot; step possible to see that the country is covered both -. ith .Institutions for the tots11v disabled and also with facilities for treatment and. training1&apos;     y/e must not too much depreciate our own country and. vould like to shov some distinguished Frenchman St. Dunstans for the blind, Roehampton for the limbless, some of        chert Ms vork-shops , the technical schools and Birmingham. Dr. Robert Jones orthopaedic hospitals, or P.!living-tons1 hospital. He thought tbe Fi enchman would - o back and Kr.it e a globing account of how magnificen 11 v we treated out wounded.2.    Discharged and TJon-pens i enable . &apos;   &apos;&apos;&quot;r. Hogge (266) took great exception to the limit of the gratuity to  100 to men admitted fit into the /rmy and discharged unfit;    he said &quot;it is not British - generosity&quot;, and he threatened, on this ratter to oppose the Minister &quot;in and. out of season1&apos;.     &apos;[rv. dynes said &quot;The offer of  100 maximum is not reasonable for the men who have been broken by the rigours of military training.
On the oth-r hand Captain Oviynn (298, speeking from the point of view of officers on active service,, said that in these cases the country made e mistake and must pay for it, hu&apos;  tho gratuity met the Justice of the c;:se.     -&quot;anv of t^em would consider themselves v ell off if thev rot f,5, and it would - be absurd to -&apos;ake these men permanent charges on the country.     The vast majority had wot rendered the country any service.-     &quot;redical unfitness was largely a matter of v illTju case of conscripts, however, in.1 ured in V&apos;-eIr prof ession, might need separate treatment. i-&quot;&apos;r. Duncan filler (307), endorsed the last point..Sir t.. Griffith Boscawen replied,, however, that disablement, not dislocation of business is the concern of the Pensions &apos; arrant.-     Sir George Toulmmn (522) said no consumptives in this class should be discharged with a gratuity but should be retained for treatment,. to avoid the danger of infection.-In replying .&apos;- ir 7-. 0.- Boscawen gave some 8 eases of men who had,managed to get passed into the Service, but, were invalided out for long standing ailments &quot;unable to march or attend parade&quot;, &quot;No military training&quot;, &apos;&apos;/1tended no parade&quot; and so on, and concluded &quot;Does the house really say that where a man did no military training at all, that he should have a pension for the rest of his life.     Some of those men have not done a day&apos;? service, it present they get nothing.     le propose to compensate V em for the errors of the doctors by a gratuity of up to  100.&quot;
3). Orgnaisation.

Mr Duncan Miller (310) said that while there were a lot of voluntary agencies doing excellent work, more co-ordination was required.

Mr. Roberts (330) thought special hospitals should be allocated for special classes of disabled.

Mr. Hogge (2063) would like to see the Statutory Committee "go the way of all flesh", and the Pensions Minister control the whole machinery.

4). Pensions to Widows.

Mr. Hogge (274) contends that pensions to widows should be a legal right. No-one else took this point.

5). Criticisms of Schedule.

Mr. Hogge and Mr. Hohler (274) thought deafness was not rated sufficiently high, and Mr. Clynes (289) held that feet should rank as limbs. Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen replied that the Ministry had formed the schedule on the advice of the senior medical officer? of the Army and Navy and felt that it was right in abiding by it.

6). Artificial Limbs.

Sir Henry Norman (285) said that provision of artificial limbs was quite inadequate and there was a long waiting list.

Captain Gwynn (297) asked whether men would be kept permanently supplied with artificial limbs.

7). Pensions and Labour Market.

Mr. Clynes (291) said the Government should take action to prevent employers from employing pensioned men or women at lower rates and thus turning to their own profit
the benefit conferred by the .state.8 ). Cost.nr. Hogge (2062) estimated Tl,o average annual cost at  15,000,000 ino declared &quot;it is not a big sum&quot;.br. Clvnes  (290) said  15,000,000 ought not to be V e limit.9).    Delays in Pensions.vr. Hogge (272) pointed out that whereas a discharged soldier may get fourteen shillings a week and separation allowance for a fortnight, but if the pension ies not decided in a fortnight, the-allowanee dropped, and contended it should continue till a decision is reached, 1&apos;r. Owynn (293) endorsed this.      This clause, he said, Inflicts hardship vhich cannot be   justified because the .-m-n is not in fault.     Sir George Toulmin (319) said &quot;Cessation of pa-should r ean beginning of pension&apos;&apos;&quot;     Re also protested as to Class y.     Sir /.G. Hoseawen in the case of Class ty. explained that a temporary allowance was to be made bv the ministry of Pensions to men who are unfit to work and are being now re-.classifled.      v/hen discharged they would get a pension dating back to their first disablement,10). - Disease attributable to Service.fir. Hogge (264) wanted an appeal from the Pensions Minister, he also wanted to abolish the v.-ord &quot;substantial&apos;&apos; y1 from the limit ing clause, &quot;substantially aggravated&quot; by active service.T&apos;r. Clvnes (289) asked who is to determine whether aggravation is substantial.Mr.  Pennefather (329) asked for a definition of substantial.
&apos; r. Harris (301) said that in deciding whetherincapacity was attributable to service the benefit of thedoubt should always be given to the man.11).     Allowance for attendant.--&quot;r, Pennefather (326) asked whether partpayment could be allowed for partial attendance.12).    Acceptance of Gratuity.?fr,  Pennefather asked whether the acceptance ofa&quot;gratuity precluded a further claim to pension in caseof recurrence of breakdown.13).    Pa r ent s * t 11 o w a nc. s .?&apos;r. Hogge (2^0) said allowances should be upfiveto fifteen shillings for one parent and twenty/shillings for two and should be claimable whenever the parents beeore infirm.7&apos;r. MacGallum Scott (306) said th    scale of provision was sufficient, but pointed out, the parents who have exploited a son early, are better off than those who sent their son to apprenticeship or higher training, beacuse they do not need to prove infirmity in order to qualify for pensions.      Both classes should be put on a level.T;&apos;r. Pennefather (327) said the test should be nee e s s i t v, not 1 nf i rmity..&apos;&quot;r. Hohler (314) said a widowed mother should *ot need to prove pre-war dependence.fir /.G. Boscawen made it clear that at any time, even years afterwards, if parents became unable to support themselves, they could be pensioned.14).    Seven Year Period.!-&quot;r. Hogge (269) said there should be no time limit for men who have definitely suffered a, casualty where
disability e rising from the vound becomes apparent after seven years.Mr. Honler- wanted limitation of seven years struck out in respect both to wounds and disease.It. Pennefathen (3E6) also vished to strike out the limitation of period.15 ). Servic.e Pens ions .Mr. Hohler (314) said a man ought to hpye full rank scale both for hie disability pension and for his s e rvi c e pens i on..Mr. Pennef a then (325) said that the two pensions are Irrespective of tfach otherjfor they are earned in d.if f erent v? ays .;,m Hogge (265) made the same claim..Sir f. ,(t, Boscaven s-aid a man get,s his Service1 on.^pension in respect of his/service,.. and- his disability pension in respect of his disability.     The rank is counted either in the one. or in. the other-, but could not be counted twice over.      It Is the first warrant in ^hich it has- been, possible to get both pensions.16 ),    European and Non-European Soldiers.,;Mr. Hogge (262) wanted, to know how this applies in. regard to pens-Ions payable by India Office... He said the Marrant should be applicable both to European and fton-Furopaan soldiers..     He suggested the question whether a European soldier- serving in India under certain conditions might be Ineligible.,Mr. Pemberton Billing (350) inquired into the case of j fric-ans and half--breeds in British Regiments.Sir / Mr, Roscawen explained that the Warrant applies to all white men in British units...    Coloured troops would be considered later.

The Luton Local Committee 1 s Trainin, Schemej which Is under- consideration, proposes to train men In the staple industries of the district, i.e. felt and straw hat making, bonnet making, and engineerings They state that they have the co-operation of most of the local employers, the Employment Exchange, and the Education Authorities.An enquiry has been received from the Director of Medical Services of the Italian Army, Naples, asking for details of the arrangements being made in Great Britain for the care of partially disabled men after their discharge,-   7.:.7 , -and information is being prepared for the Italian Government,The enquiry is being made In conjunction with the Ministry of Labour as to processes of industry suitabM for the various disabilities Is proceeding..     The Schedules f: the Tailoring and Cinematograph trades and the Coal-Mining Industry are completed and the results will shortly be collated for issue to Local Committee.

The Section are waiting definite schemes.A report has been received from Crcydon Local Committee showing that 86 discharged men. have been placed in employment by the Local Employment Exchange, of these 44 have been placed in munitions (principally labourers and semi-skilled men) and 42 in other employment (Grocery, Tram-driving Engineer fs fitters, Flour Liills &amp;c,)     The former number are, mostly men strong enough to do their pre-war work as general labourers &amp;e*, and most of the latter number have returned to their old occupations ar work akin thereto.     The Local Committee report that practically all these C6. men are in permanent employmentPENSIONS BRANCHrThe Pensions Sub-Committee at their meeting on the 2nd instant considered the status of certain classes of Boy Ratings in the Navy and decided that service in the classes of Boy Artificers and Boy Shipwrights should be regarded as apprenticeship.The Sub-Committee also had before them the question of the eligibility for Supplementary Pension of widows married after mobilization or enlistmentand In view of the fact that such cases are outside the scope
