A Farm of 60 acres near Heatley has been taken over, by the Executive Committee who have arranged for its cultiva-tion by neighbouring farmers.   Notices have been served to secure the proper cultivation of the two farms aggregating 176 ac.  in the Northwich Union, and supervision of tHis cultivation has been arranged for.CjJBSRjLAiTD.   The Executive Committee has been authorised to take over two b&amp;dly cultivated farms aggregating. 378 ac. near Wigton and Penrith respectively.-DEVON.   The survey has been completed:   it has been found that 3505 holdings require inspection for the cultivation of 1917.    The Executives&apos;  surveyors have been instructed to select from these holdings those which; require most supervision - 100 horses and ploughmen have been applied for from the nilitary authorities,   a
scheme far the employment of prisoners of mr at lopsham has been put forward.SLOUOESTER. In the Cirencester district 11,000 ac. will be sown with spring corn by farmers with their own resources; and another 1,200 ao. if the Committee can provide sufficient labour and machinery. Similar conditions are reported from the other CotswoId districts.ROT3HIRE. The Committee have decided to take over Dummer Down Farm,^&quot; HITon / Candover.   The /Hipp Inscombe estate, near indover is : reported to be derelict; as the greater part is in V/iltshire the Wiltshire Executive Committee have been asked to take action.&apos;.:HBREgQH5SHI53v.   The Executive Committee have ordered 100 tonsof 3uxpliaTe&quot;:; uf ilmmonia-IviOITT. The Executive Committee have arranged for artificial manures &quot;&quot;tract ors, steam cultivators f etc to be supplie d to 5 farms in the Strood district.   They have given directions for ploughing 50 ao, near Walmer contrary to-the covenants of the tenancy.   They have also given directions to cultivate a farm of 230 ac near V/altham, and they have threatened to take ever the farm unless the cultivation is improved,?;IP^^^PJ^J^l&apos; The survey of thirteen districts is practically completed. &quot;The&quot; Towcester district &quot;contains the largest percentage of badly farmed land and the tractors are first to be used in that district,   The Executive Committee have purchased 100 tons of Sulphate of Ammonia at  15,10* a ton which is being sold to farmers,^QTTINGHrAM0 The Executive Committee are making arrangements to allocate&quot; the steam cultivators working in the county so as to secure the maximum utility,SOMERSETSEIRE, Survey completed except in three districtsAs a result&quot;of Ths survey, 3834 ae. of arable land have been found which a?,y go uncultivated unless more labour is provided;   752-0 aca of clover leys and temporary pasture are fit to be broken up if labour is forthcominge     50 ac, of allotments may go uncultivated &quot;onless labour and.necessary supplies are forthcoming;   20        are vacant; and there are 82 ace of vacant land which might be cropped by allotment-mathods.   The Executive Committee is taking prompt action with regard to land which the survey has shown to be badly cultivated; and they consider that the carrying out of the survey itself has encouraged a fuller cultivation than would have been the case if it had not been effected.     They have issued a notice to the local press with regard to the use of Sulphate of Ammonia and 3asic Slag; and have engaged a panel of ten surveyors to see that the directions based on the result of the survey are carried out.WILTSHIRE, Tenants of farms have agreed to break up 691 ac. for crops in 1917 and 283 ac. for crops in 1918. The Executive Committee Lre taking action with regard to lands insufficiently cultivated.RID IMG.

The Executive Committee have given instructions to plough 98 ac. in Reedness contrary to a covenant i-i &quot;che tenancy.
Extended Powers of County Executive ..-Commit tg,es A Regulation has been submitted to amend Regulation 82and to give to the County Executives power to requisition agricul-tural machinery, animals and plant-, whether required for land which has been taken possession of by them or not, so that the County Executive may be able to utilise fully where they are wanted all machinery, animals or plant within their county that may be of use for securing an increased ftod supply.   The proposed regulation will also give the Executive Committees power to let lairid of which they have taken possession;   this power is very necessary and has been asked for by several Executive Committees;    one instance will be found under &quot;Yorkshire Hast Riding&quot;.     Power is also proposed to be given by the draft Regulation for the Executive Committee to determine the tenancy of any land or to authorise the landlord to do so.Compensation.At present where the County Executive take possession of any land they have no power to make any payment to the dis-possessed tenant or to the landlord, but any claimant for compensation has to be1 referred to the Defence of the xiealm (Losses) Commission. This may often inflict hardship, especially where the tenant is old and helpless, as in several cases where the Executive Committee have found it necessary to take such action;   and this considera-tion might hamper the activities of the Ccunty Executive.   Arrange-ments are, therefore being made with the Losses . Commission tt allow payment on account if large claims, and final settlement of small clairis, by the Board on the certificates of one or two surveyors upon whase opinion the Commission rely.Destruction of Pheasants Order. *The new Regulation 2R having been added to the Defence of the Realm Regulations by Order in Council, an order has been made by the Board delegating to County Executive Committees the power to authorise occupiers to shaot pheasants on their land up to the 31st March 1917, and a Circular of Instructions is being issued to the Committees.   Notice to the above effect has been issued to the Press.Cultivation of Vacant Land.We have been informed that 29,140 applications have been made for plots, in 187 districts.     18,728 plots have been provided, containing 1343 acres.These particulars are not exhaustive, but all the evidence indicates that&quot;the - scheme is being taken up vigorously by Urban Local Authorities throughout the country.Reports show that Local Authorities are active in cultivating their own land, principally with potatoes and oats.Horticultural Section.Dr. Eredk. Keeblc, E.R.S. of the Royal Horticultural Society has been appointed to be Director in charge cf a new Section of the Department concerned solely with Horticulture.
During the week a scheme for bringing into cultivation gardens attached to empty houses has been set working at Yfeybridge. Preliminary steps have been taken to form Pood Production Committees in Boroughs, Urban District Councils and Parishes.II.   TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY.The work of this Division as being organised by Mr. Acland but, at present, it is hampered through want of housing accommodation.     The Division consists of technical experts on the Board&apos;s staff and from Agricultural Colleges and liesearch. Institutes with the necessary clerical assistance.     Technical enquiries and similar work are being dealt with promptly (chiefly through the post) but it is hoped to bring the staff together immediately when the policy and work of the Division will be mapped out in detail.in.   lab mm.The scheme for the distribution of soldier labour, mentioned in last week&apos;s report, has been held in abeyance in order that the Director-General andthe newly appointed Deputy-Director-General and Director of Labour might consider it.    During the past few days conferences have taken place between representatives of the Pood Production Department and the V/ar Office, as a result of which it has been decided that, in the first place, only about 6,000 soldiers net reserved for Home Defence, instead of the 15,000 such soldiers, originally promised, will be transferred to Class W. Reserve and sent to about 20 selected Army Depots.     Prom these depots they will be distributed to farmers an application through the -Jar Agricultural Committees .     In addition 12,500 men from the Home Defence Porce will be supplied to farmers according to the demands of each County, and for the purpes-e of distribution they will be passed through the said depots.The V/ar Office will be notified from time to time by the Pood Production Department of the number of these men required to be forwarded to the depots in order to meet the known demands of the Counties served from each depot.It has also been decided to exchange the 4,000 Combatant Prisoners of War placed at the disposal *f the Board of Agriculture by the Employment of Prisoners of War Committee for an equivalent number of men belonging to Infantry Y/orks Battalions,. who will be transferred to Class \7. Reserve and distributed with the other men of that class referred to above.     The Department will notify the War Office to which depots these men should be sent in order to satisfy the requirements of the Counties wha had previously applied for the prisoners.Some additional schemes for the employment of batches of 7o prisoners of war have been forwarded to the War Office, and in view of the exchange referred to above it is new being considered whether any of the Schemes which are in an advanced state can be completed by supplying Non-Combatant in lieu of combatant prisoners.   Some 5,800 non-combatant prisoners have been placed at the .B$ard&apos;s disposal but there is considerable doubt as to whether any large number of these will volunteer for agricultural work.The Leaflet indicating that horses and men are available 1 or farmers in the neighbourhood of military stations has been issued.
Thirty-five Russian soldiers have &quot;been found work with farmers in the neighbourhood cf Lewi sham.IV.    SUPPLIES.v ;, Machinery Section.Mr. Percival perry, the European Representative cf the Pood Organisation, has been appointed Director of thjs Section which has been entirely re-organised.     It has been ascertained tnat tnere is a total of 459 Tractors of various ma.kes on order abroad not yet received into this Country of which 35 are expected to Dock- at : Liverpool on &quot;the 4th inst.   In addition the Department has been offered approximately 15 Tractors stated to be for sale owing ta shortage of labour for operating.     In every case-we are negotiating to buy these.     The actual number of Tractors already bought and actually in use in the Department is 32.   Unfortunately the despatch of these to the Y/ar AgriculturalCommit tees to. whom, they have been allocated had been unaccountably.delaysd.     This natter is receiving the most urgent attention and at least half of the number are already actually at work on the land.     A gathering cf representative automobile agents was held to-day with a View to organising: through competent local agents the- maintenance cf Tractors at work and it is expected by these means that satisfactory arrangements will be made f or isandling the 32 Tractors already at the Departments disposal and the 459 which it is expected to receive.1-yholesale Manufacturers and Dealers have been circularised and it has beon ascertained that there are 1,031 Tractors in England and Wales in private ownership.     Each owner is being asked whet lie r the Tractors are in working order and if so whether they will place them at the Government&apos;s disposal subject to a remuneration on business footing.     An appeal to the same effect has been sent to the press.     In spite of these efforts it may be necessary for the Department to obtain power ta commandeer any privately swned Tractcrs to ensure that they are utilised to their maximum extent.A list of 478 steam ploughing tackle sets in priv^a hands has been compiled with a view to taking similar action as that indicated above in the case of the Tractors.The Depart:.lent&apos;s Inspectors have made special enquiries as to 43 sets of steam tackle remaining idle ovang to lack of labour and application has been made to the V/ar Office for 36 skilled.men to staff them.Eertilisers. Feeding Stuffs, Seeds, etc .Subjects relating to the supply of Eertilisers and Feeding Stuffs have hitherto been in charge of the Ministry of E^od. It has now been decided to transfer the control of the manufacture of the chief Eertilisers to the Ilinistry of llunitions, while questions relating to their distribution and prices charged to Earners will be dealt with in this Department..       Returns of Stocks of Manures hitherto obtained from manufacturers only are now being obtained from Dealers.During the week a conference with Dealers in Seed Corn &quot;aS, ttn held and i-b has ^een ascertained that the trade anticipate no difficulty in securing all the eats required for sowing.v^+^v n^?53 of wheat wil1 be scarce but the supply of food is not likely to suffer from this cause.
The position as regards seed potatoes is giving rise to anxiety.     The Committee oi Traders purchasing for us in Scotland now report, great difficulty in securing supplies.     The hew Seed Order which raises prices is expected to &quot;bring out more seed;    &quot;but for a week or so it is not possible to estimate the quantity Scotland wi11 yield,     A small quantity of seed is being purchased in England and, if forced to do s$t we shall increase cur buying, but for \    most purposes -English seed is not  -. desirable.Potatoes from the rorth of Ireland make good seed and a further attempt has been made during the week to induce the Irish Department to allow export, but we have not yet had their reply..     It is absolutely essential that, not less than 20,000 tons of seed potatoes should be sup-oiled from Ireland, and delivered within a month, if the vital needs of this country are to be met.The orders placed by tis for seed potatoes during the week February 21st-27th in Scotland 2,303 tons, in Yorkshire and Lincoln 225 tons.     The orders were on behalf of 25 Comity War Agricultural Committees, 4 District (or Parish) Councils ?nd 1 Society.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) A. LEB,- p.p.  (ltd.)

Outline of Work done by Chief Woman Inspector.

Wednesday, February 21st - Wednesday, February 28th.

During the past week the Chief Travelling Inspector, Miss La Mothe attended the General Annual Meeting of the Farmers&apos; Union at the Savoy Hotel, and was given an opportunity of addressing the meeting on the subject of women&apos;s labour.

She also visited Holmes Chapel Agricultural College to make an inspection on behalf of the Board with a view to finding out whether it is suitable as a training centre for women, and reports:-

"The Education Committee are most anxious that the Board should take over the College, and are willing to do anything in their power to arrange for its transference, should the Board agree to the terms suggested. I promised that a reply should be sent to them by Monday, March 5th."

Miss La Loth reports after a visit to Cheshire on the
