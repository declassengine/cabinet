REPORT TO THE CABIIJET.-:,- .p3rd Karen. 1917.GeneralPolicy. Important Conferences hare been held duringthe last week(i) with General Trenchard;(ii) with the Representatives of the Aeronautical Section of the French Ministry of War. . (i)   At the Conference with General Trenchard the whole of the various questions relating to the supoly of machines and engines to the British Expedi-tionary Foroe were discussed and his views ascertained.A decision was arrived at that, in order to expedite the formation of squadrons of Sopwith Triplanes .^nd Spads, the whole of the output of the former machines should he allocated to the ITavy and the whole of the output of the latter to the Army.(ii)   It has been the practice in the past for periodical Conferences to take place between the Representatives of the British and French Aviation Services alternately in London and Paris.     In view of the functions now attributed to the Air Board, the Conferences will now take place between that body and the Representatives of the French Services.   -The first of these Conferences took place on the 27 th and 28th February.     The questions under discus-sion related entirely to the supply of rav material from this Country to French manufacturers, for the purpose partly of meeting their own aircraft manufacturing requirements and partly for the
purpose of the contracts for aero-engines olhced in Prance by the British Government.     The quantities supplied have fallen short of the expectations of the French manufacturers owing to a variety of causes, and, in particular, there has been delay in forwarding the material required for the important contracts for Clerget and Hispano Suiza engines placed in Prance.As a result of this, Colonel Regnier, the Director of the Aeronautical section of the Prench Minis-try of War, informed the Board that the suooly of Clerget engines to this Country would have to cease entirely, after the 1st Larch.The Conference, at which were present Repre-sentatives of the sections of the Ministry of Munitions dealing with steel and machine tools, proved of great advantage in clearing up the situation.     It -was possible to satisfy the Prench representatives that every effort was being made to meet their reasonable requirements, and Colonel Regnier informed, the Board that the supply of Clerget engines would continue until the 15th Karch, by which time it was hoped that the consignments of raw material \vould reach Prance insufficient quantities to permit of the original arrangements being carried out.,   (iii)    In reply to an enquiry from the War Trade Department, the Board have stated that in their opinion it was advisable to prevent so far as possible the importa tion of mahogany and certain other woods suitable for aircraft construction into:-Scandinavia, inasmuch as the Norwegian Government do not contemplate building any aircraft for themselves and wood so imoorted would&apos; probaol; reach the enemy.   ..
(iv)     The Board have had under consideration a request from the American Government(a)     for the transfer to them of a small number of Monosoupaoe engines under construction in the States on an Admiralty contract, ... and(h)     for specimen machines of the latest types : * jof Sopwith and Short seaplanes and aero-planes, or. failing these, for the working drawings.As regards (a), the Board decided to approve tho transfer.As to (h), it was decided to reply that rrhile it was impossible to furnish model machines, the working drawings would be furnished by the Air IBoard and arrangements made ^ith the designers for the right to manufacture in America.    The drawings would be handed over on the condition that they would be treated as secret and not communicated to any foreign Government.     In arriving at this decision the Board had regard to the danger that in the event of war between the United States and Germany, the former might interfere with the supply to us of the aero-engines and machines now being constructed for us in the States.     The Air Board will select suit-able designs for -communication.(Signed) H. P. HARVEY.Secretary to the Air-Board.
