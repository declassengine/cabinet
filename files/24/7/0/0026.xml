SEC RET.General Hanbury Williams te Sir William Robertstn.7/3/17.8-^8.. Secret.    &apos;The relations between Russia and Roumania are, in my opinion,  improving.     Alexieff is less impulsive than Gurko and more inclined to sympathize&apos;.   He says that 200/300 sets of equipment are being sent to Rcumania immediately.,     .That withdrawal of part of Roumanian army would be only into BESSARABIA to rest and refit, period of about 2 months and thus avoid.Gurko1 proposal to divert&apos; them right into the interior of Russia The enemy, he says, continue to withdraw troops from Roumanian front..     In a month and a half he hopes to recover a good part .of DOBRTJJA and-part of Roumania. I am leaving probably at the end of this week and will endeavour tu assist- in this matter further.
