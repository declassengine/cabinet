SECRET.ItiSUPPLY OP MEN FOR THE ARMY.Further Memorandum by the Army Council.1. In a memorandum dated 10th February last, containing their replies to certain questions by the War Cabinet regarding the supply of men to the Army, the Army Council pointed out that as far as they could judge there would be an increasing shortage in the drafts available to make good wastage if heavy fighting occurred in France in April, unless more drastic measures were taken than those already decided on, including the review of Tribunal exemptions.2. Since that date the Council have had an opportunity to form an estimate of the additional men who will be made available by the decisions of the War Cabinet subsequent to 4th February, 1917, and it appears that these will not exceed 50,000, who will join the Colours for training from now up to the end of May. These men will not be available for drafts in any appreciable number before the end of August at the earliest.3. With the approval of the War Cabinet an estimate of the drafts which he might expect to receive each month up to July inclusive, was communicated to Sir Douglas Haig on the 15th February, in order that he might have an opportunity of judging, if necessary, in consultation with General Nivelle, whether any modification of the approved plan of campaign was necessary as a result of the prospective diminishing strength of the British Divisions. Sir Douglas Haig was also requested to submit his observations on the suggestion that in view of the introduction of mechanical methods of warfare the number of battalions in a division should be reduced.4. As regards the adequacy of the prospective drafts, Sir Douglas Haig has replied as follows : &quot;The effect of the prospective shortage of men, in so far as the operations on the Western front are concerned, may be summarised as follows : The numbers available will probably be sufficient to enable the full offensive Dower of the divisions being developed at the outset of the first offensive. 3ut only at the expense of other divisions. This will enhance the risks on the already depleted defensive fronts. Further, the shortage will undoubtedly limit considerably the power to exploit an initial success to the full, or to maintain the offensive for any extended period.The inability to replace the wastage incurred during the operations already arranged with the French will also curtail the scope of any subsequent operations which may be desirable later in the year. (Defensive as well as offensive.)In addition to the above it must not be overlooked that the inability to keep units up to establishment will have the inevitable effect of lowering the moral of the troops.&quot;5. With reference to the suggestion that the number of battalions in a division should be reduced, he makes the following observations : &quot;It would be impossible at the present time to carry out the reorganization suggested. Our offensive preparations which are already well advanced, and which may have to be put into operation at an early date, would have to be re-cast in many respects if such a change were made. This could not be done without considerable delay.Even if this were not so, I do not consider that an organization in divisions of nine battalions would be advantageous in our Army. In such an organi-zation the proportion of Commanders, Staffs, Administrative Services, and necessarily employed men, as compared with total fighting strength, would undoubtedly be higher than it is under our present system.(B17/7)   25   3/17   H&amp;s   4047-12woGen. No. 6012
In comparing our organization with that of Continental armies, it must be remembered that the problem for them is different to ours owing to their regimental system, which not only simplified the change in their case but, in changing, enable them to escape from the somewhat vicious arrangement of having brigades organized in two regiments, and divisions in two brigades. Our organization of divisions in three brigades, and of brigades iD four battalions was based on sounder principles.Should the shortage of men necessitate a reduction in the fighting units, I consider that it would be preferable to break up a certain number of divisions rather than to reduce the fighting strength of each Division.This procedure would economize staffs and administrative services whilst at the same time maintaining the fighting efficiency of the remaining divisions.I hope, however, that no such measure will be necessary and, in any case, that it can be avoided for the next few months, otherwise a redistribution of troops along our front will be unavoidable as well as a reorganization of administrative services.&quot;6. In their memorandum of 10th February the Army Council recorded their opinion that no reduction in the number of battalions in a division should be made until it has been clearly proved that, having regard to other demands essential to the effective prosecution of the war, it is no longer possible to obtain the number of men required to maintain our divisions at their present establishment. In that memorandum they also expressed the hope that the question of providing the men required to keep the armies up to strength would receive the immediate attention of the War Cabinet, and earnestly&apos;requested that they might be informed at once whether further measures would&apos; be taken with that object, and when those measures would become operative. They now wish to make it clear that the only men available for drafts from the present time till the end of September, inclusive, are those who are already under training and those recruits who will join during the months of March, April, May and the earlier part of June, supplemented by such numbers of sick and wounded as shall have again become fit for general service. The aggregate of the men so available will fall far short of probable requirements. The Council wish to make it equally clear that, although it is&apos;now too late to improve the situation in regard to the prospects of meeting heavy wastage during the current spring and summer, it will still be necessary to spare no.efforts to repair that wastage and once more complete the divisions to establishment at the earliest possible moment.7. The Army Council, therefore, desire to repeat their request that the War Cabinet will at once inform them whether further measures will be taken to provide more men.By Command of the Army Council, &apos;6th March, 1917.
