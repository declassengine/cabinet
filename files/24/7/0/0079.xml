345T!ll^Tw the meeting yesterday reference was made to the re-duct ion due to losses and to reduction of tonnage in our im-(aj for the Allied Irmies - British, French and Italian (b) for civilian consumption in the U.K. and it was suggested that this should be made good by divert-shortage by increased killings of home stock for civilian con-sump t ion.It may be convenient if I explain shortly how the Board of Trade deal with refrigerated meat.  They buy the entire ex-portable output of Australian and New Zealand beef, mutton and lamb transport it in vessels the imsulated spaces of which they have requisitioned, give the Armies what they need and sell the surplus-mainly mutton and lamb- in the market here at prices and under conditions which tend to   keep down meat prices generally.     In this way the Board imported from Aus-tralasia in 1916 about 245,000 tons of meat of which 150,000 tons went to the Armies and the rest to civilians.The chief source of supplies of refrigerated beef is the River Plate and there the Board of Trade have made contracts with the principal packing firms (2 British 4 American &amp; 1 Argen tine) which with the control we have over the British insulated tonnage-which we have requisitioned-ensures our getting nearly the whole exportable output so far as tonnage is available for its transport.     It is one of the terms of the contracts that we will provide insulated space for the transport of a reason-able proportion of meat on trade account to enable our con-tractors to keep together their organization in this counfi&quot;y for the sale of such meat.    The total amount of plate meat we supplied to the Armies in 1916 was 426,000 tons and the amount of &quot;trade meatn was 120,000 tons.ported meat supplies.ing refrigerated iiited meat from (b) to (a) and by making up thea)

347ieral Number/7241WAR OFFICE,LONDON, S.W.SitriuiilUC/Ji /  f knj. ^G.6) 22nd February, 1917.uir,With reference to the discussion at the Conference held in Mr. Roperfs room at the Board of Trade Offices, on the 19th instant, on the question of the general meat stocks of this Oountry, I am commanded to acquaint you that the Army Council would be glad if the Board of Trade would consider, in the first instance, the taking over of all refrigerated space in vessels which now convey chilled meat for the Trade, for the conveyance of frozen meat, with a view to increasing the stocks of frozen meat coming into the Country for Army use,.I am to add that the Council would prefer this action rather than resorting, at the present stage, to the issue of fresh meat to the troops in Great Britain, as previously proposed,I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) H. H. CUBITT.be Secretary,Board of Trade, Gwydyr House,Whitehall, S. W.
. . Board of Trade,M.31324. 7, Whitehall Gardens,London, S.W. 8th March,1917.Sir,I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Cubitt!s letter 53/Gen.No.7241 (Q.M.G.6.) of February 22nd, in which it is suggested that, in lieu of the proposal that the Army in the United Kingdom should be fed in part from British-raised meat, the whole of the insulated ton-nage from the River Plate should be appropriated for tbe oar-riage of frozen meat for the Allied Forces.   In reply, I am to submit the following observations for the consideration of the Army Council.It would not be possible to confine the Plate tonnage to Army meat since it is necessary to provide tonnage for the shipment of &quot;offal&quot; (tongues, hearts, &amp;c.) otherwise the   freeze ing Y/orks would be come blocked and would be unable to proceed with their business.   This amounts to four per cent, of the monthly output, or say about 2,000 tons per month.   The total amount of additional meat that could be provided for Army purpos-es would not exceed the quantity of chilled and frozen meat carried from the Plate in 1916 for trade purposes,, namely 88,000 tons of beef and 32,000 tons of mutton.   In the opinion of the Board the effects of withdrawing this meat from civilian con-sumption would be very serious.   The only restraint on the rise in the price of home-raised beef is the competition of imported chilled and frozen beef from the Plate, as the imports from the Uniced States are both small in quantity and poor in quality. Further, all the present shippers from the Plate have their ovm distributive organisations through which their trade meatis
49is sold-, and one of them, the British and Argentine Meat Go. Ltd., sells its trade meat through its own retail shops.   If all the supplies of refrigerated Plate meat to the trade are stopped the Meat Companies either will  have to close down their organisations, in whicli case they will have a claim to compensation, or they will have to buy British meat thus forcing up prices.   The retail shops (apart from those of the British and Argentine Meat Co.^ which at present sell only imported beef would ^ot be able to turn to the sale of British meat unless their former suppliers took up the fresh meat business.   In this connexion it may be pointed out that the Board recently ceased temporarily to place colonial meat on the market owing to the abundance of British-grown supplies, hi but were compelled to resume issues in order to keep alive a number of retail butchersf snaps that dealt only in colonial meat and hrd not enough dredit in other quarters to enable them to turn to the sale of British meat.It is also to be remembered that it is an honourable con-dition of the present Plate contract that the contractors should be allowed 20% of the requisitioned tonnage for the carriage of trade meat, and that, while on the whole they have not received this proportion, the stoppage of the whole supply would entitle them to compensation.   The Board can hold out no hove that the adcitioral supply which the War Office ask for can be obtained except on terms which would make the price, including freight, equivalent to the present market price of chilled beef, which is onlv slightly below that of British beef.   The economic position of the American meat companies is so strong owing to the large demands of the Allied Forces for meat that, so long as the great bulk of the supplies are taken from the Plate and no large and safe new source of -------
of supply is developed, no effective resistance can be made to their price demands.   In fact the Board anticipate that so large an interference with current trade as that which the Tiar Office propose would be certain to lead to a demand a revised contract at higher prices.The Board are very strongly of the opinion, for the reasons assigned above, that the $ar Office proposal would lead to an increase of the prices of both imported and British-grown meat, thus causing hardship to civilians as well as additional expense to the State, and that these re-suits would seriously offset the advantages of departmental convenience to which importance is naturally attached by the War Office.I am also to draw the particular attention of the Army Council to the very grave situation of supplies at the pr .--sent moment owing to the small number of sailings from the Plate in February, a situation which has been aggravated by the loss of the s.s. f&apos;Drina&quot; homeward bound.   The prolonga-tiorjR of voyages due to Admiralty orders for the safety of ships and the increasing demands of the Eastern Mediferra-nean Forces are reducing the effective capacity of the meat - lips to a serious extent, and the Board anticipate that the present situation must recur more than once during the summer, even if no more steamers are lost.   Moreover, the need of the country, for imported cereals is now so great that it is probable that the Shipping Controller will with-draw certain insulated vessels from the Australasian trade, and if this is done the meat situation will be made worse.The Board of Trade have given the whole situation most careful consideration and have come to the conclusion that the only sage course is to draw upon home resources for at least half the requirements of the troops in the United Kingdom and they are furth er o i the opinion that contracts for the purchase of British meat should be made now whilethere
351there are still stall-fed cattle rather than in the Spring and early Summer when cattle have just been put on the grass.Copies of your letter under reference and of this reply have been sent to the Pood Controller, the Ministry of  Shipping, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Local Government Board.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd) GAENHAM ROPER. :
