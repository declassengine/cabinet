THEATRICAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS.(a)   A department to deal with the Theatrical and Allied prof03-Sions has been formed with Sir Goo.Alexander and I!r,Charles.Gulliver in charge, and a meeting of members of the professions at St. James-&apos; Theatre was addressed on Saturday by the Director ^General.

AGRICULTURAL SECTION(a) Military Labour.1.There have now boon placed on the land in Scotland 344 soldiers of whom 136 are skilled ploughmen, 12 are drivers of motor tractor ploughs, and the majority of the remaindc men with some skill in agriculture. All of these men have-come from the Home Forces. An additional body of 35 men arrived yesterday who are in process of being allocated to various farms.2.Tho Military Authorities have &quot;also now established at Hamilton a Labour Company of 250 men for agricultural purposes. These are, it is understood, almost entirely unskilled men and they are not of the same physical capacity as the soldiers from the Home Forces to whom reference has already been made.    It is proposed to employ them as soon as the farmers arc willing to take them.    It is further intended at such periods as &quot;these men arc idle to employ them on roads and in the cutting of timber, and in this way it is hoped to make the fullest use of the labour put at the disposal cf this Department by the Army. Similar Companies to that now established at Hamilton are being prepared for at other centres, namely, Perth, Invcrn-Ayr, Aberdeen- Berwick, (b) Appeal for ploughmen. 1. Mr.Tunerfs appeal produced 30 individual offers; some of the men have already been placed; others made their offer contingently upon the consent of their employer being obtained, and these consents have not yet been received,&apos;
212others arc- waiting the decision oi&apos; the War Agricultural Committees as to their allocation. 2.The most gratifying result cf Mr.Turnerfs appeal has,however, been that the Corporation of Glasgow has passed, a resolution by which they have-put at the disposal of the National Service Department, for the space of the next six weeks, all the men of agricultural experience amongst their employees, jk list of eighty four employees of the Corporation, skilled in Agriculture, has. already, been submitted to the Scottish Agricultural Committees, and these men will bo placed in situations at once.    It is very much to be desired that other Corporations should follow this very laudable example. &apos;(c ) German Prisoner Labour,The Director of the Agricultural Section has now been informed that the War Office has withdrawn all offers&quot; to supply German Prisoner Labour and proposes to make available a certain number of men from the Works Battalions in this Country.       Definite information has, however, not yet been afforded to this Department, and, accordingly, the schemes which; were in course of preparation in reliance upon German Prisoner Labour have had to be suspended, (d) Commissioners andSub-Commissioners for England.All the Commissioners have new been appointed as. have all Sub-Commissioners except two who will, it is expected, be &apos; appointed within the next few days.    They ha/e received instructions upon their duties, and it is believed that they arc entirely competent for these duties and also for such .t, further functions as they may be. asked to performzi connection with the proposed Agricultural Legislation outlined in the recent speech of the Prime Minister. GENERAL TRADES SECTIONThe work done during the. week may be briefly summarised as follows:-
