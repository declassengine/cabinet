There are now twelve Travelling Inspectors, severally responsible for the oversight of the County Committees&apos; work in specially selected areas,   To strengthen that work still further, a paid Organising Secretary is to be allotted to each County.   Twenty-eight of these posts have already been filled.Before the Branch was organised, a Women!s v/ar Agricul-tural Committee had already been appointed in every County in England, except in the case of Shropshire and Holland,   a Shropshire Committee has now been appointed and one is about to be formed in Holland.Each County Committee has been directed to appoint a small Executive and two sub-committees for (l) Training; (2J selection ana Allocation.Information has come to Headquarters that several such Committees have already been set up, with the result that the responsibility for the County work has been transferred in several cases from incompetent hands to those of greater skill.as a result of this improved County Organisation, the number of Village Registrars (of whom about 4.000 had already been appointed) has been increased.   Blank spaces are being filled up., and districts where the organisation had either been non-existent or moribund are being attended to.An enquiry has been set on foot in regard to possible training centres either on farms, or in private houses within reaoh of farmers willing to train women, or with individual farmers.Although there can be as yet no certainty as to the nioney assured by the Government for these centres, promising offers have been received within the last month from fourteen counties waking new accommodation possible for about 480 women.   If this number has been made available within so short a time and without cither advertisement, press appeal, or certainty of payment, it is evident that with such certainty and advertisement the openings for training centres might be increased tenfold.\t 0
Interviews have been held constantly with the v/ojnen directors of National bervice and with xir. iurner and. lir, Home of that Departments   as a result; the terms to be embodied in Mr. -Seville Chamberlain&apos;s appeal are nov; in proof.Similar negotiations have also, been continuous with Hiss Durham and the Officers of the ilinistry of Labour, while arrange-raents are in hand with the Army Contract Department of the v/ar Office for the supply of equipment to the women land workers,I append a diagram Shewing the links between the Head-quarters in London and the paid and voluntary workers in the counties,(SgdJ   H.L. lALBOI c   &apos;Director of v/omen&apos;s boction.
