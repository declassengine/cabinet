Application, forns are not being sent out as fast as was anticipated in the first report though about a thousand a day are being sent out. Additional clerical assistance is required if the work is not to: fall very much in arrears.     The work could easily be done by women, and it is the kind of work for which they are well suited.Another source of delay over which the Board have no control is the disorganisation of the transport service.    Lany- I retail dealers in seed potatoes have &quot;sold out&quot; of their stocks &apos;r almost before the potatoes have been delivered to them by the wholesale dealer or grower, and application forms cannot be countersigned by the dealers until the supplies are received, The supplies arranged to be sent by the Board to the war Agricultural Committees are not delivered, and until they are, the licences cannot be issued.
