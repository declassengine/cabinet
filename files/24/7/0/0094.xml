SECRET  . 01/89/259.Despatch of Reinforcements from the Western to the Italian Front.-------------------- t1.   At the Allied Conference held at Rome early in January of this year it was agreed that the Military Advisers of the Governments concerned should consider the question of sending assistance to Italy for the pur-pose of a combined offensive being made by the three Allies across the Italian Front.2.   A plan for this operation was prepared by Gener-a Cadorna and forwarded by the Italian Government to the Prime Minister.    The gist of it was that 300 heavy guns and 8 divisions should be sent to Italy and commence to arrive there on 15th February.   The plan was received in London during the last week of January.3.    In the meantime an Anglo-French Conference had been held in London (about the middle of January), at whjch it had been agreed between the two Governments that all the forces on the Western Front should be employed there in carrying out the plan of offensive operations put forwrard by General Nivelle.     This Agreement precluded the possibility of detaching either French or British troops or guns to the assistance of Italy for offensive operations there.4.    I submitted to the War Cabinet a Note to this effect on the 29th Janfl&amp;*y, and suggested that the Itali Government should be at once informed in the above sense I do not know whether this has been done, as the Note has note/considered
considered by the War Cabinet, but in any case the question of sending assistance to Italy for the offensive operations proposed by General Cadorna in January last is nov,r dead.5.     In its place another question has arisen - that ofreinforcing Italy for defensive purposes in the event ofher being heavily attacked by Germany when the situation aseason permit.    In a Note dated 23rd February last regard!Germany&apos;s intentions I pointed out that an attack on Italywas a probable development of German plans, and said thatn0n the Italian front the prospects are attractive, but an attack on a large scale could not well take place before May, and, therefore, it largely depends upon what happens meanwhile on the Western front.,&quot;On 1st March (war Cabinet Meeting 83) the War Cabinet... after interviewing Signor Bissolati, impressed upon me the importance of. avoiding a repetition In Italy of the Roumanian debacle,., and I then said that the question was part of the general strategical problem which confronted the Allies as a whole and could not be considered as a purely British question, more especially as we now stood fully committed to place the whole of our forces on the V/estern front under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief during the coming battle. I added that the general plan was that each Ally should be able to defend his own f and be given such assistance as he might need by offensive action on other Allied fronts, and that to move troops about from one front to anotheV for defensive purposes was unsound in many ways., and was to be strongly deprecated.6,./
485&apos;(*&amp;r.     Since then I have received a letter from General Oadorna (Appendix I.) and a telegram from the Chief of the British Hission at Italian Headquarters^ summarising General Cadorna^s views (Appendix II), In connection with these views I may say that various reasons may he adduced for the shortening of the enemy5 s line on the Western Frontf  one of them being that he may wish to set free troops for an attack an Italy if and wnon the situation permitsB.     Primarily, however;,  and for the moment.  I think that his dispositions are of a defensive nature, and that he will await the result of our expected attack before sending any large number of troops against the Italian Pronto      If our attack is not successful he may well be able to find sufficient troops to dead with Italy., for he still has some 20 new Divisions at least in Germany which have not yet been put into the fieldo7a     The possibility of Italy requiring-assistance either from, the French or ourselves, or from both,  is therefore undoubtedly one for which provision should be made, and all possible arrangements for giving such assistance should be worked out at gnce6 but since the troops sent, whether French or British, must come from the Western Front the arrangements- for&quot; their transport must be left to the Frenohc8a     As to whether French or British troops or both should be sent,, or how many should be sentT in the event of it becoming necessary and feasible to send any, it is not possible to say now, as this Ernst obviously depend upon the result of the forthcoming operations on the Western front, upon the developments of the unfortunate Russian situation, - and upon the extent to which, we cankeep
4c466keep our Amies up to strength,.    It would, however, he a great advantage if the troops sent were homogeneous, and in my opinion French troops should he sent, because the railways are entirely in French hands and must continue to be,: and it is much easier to supply French troops in Italy than it would be to supply British troopso Further, General iTiveile stated in January last that if the British took over the additional front, which we have since taken over, it would give him a larger reserve and enable him to send troops to the south to deal with a possible German advance through Switzerland designed to attack either Italy or France^   If he has reserves to meet that contingency, it follows that he should be able to meet the alternative contingency of an attack from the Trentino.   At any rate it is highly improbable: that vjq could send many troops&apos;, and certainly not as many as 20 divisions (as proposed by General Cadorna,), unless the French took ba,ck a corresponding part of the front which we now holdo9,      Although it is not now possible to decide as to the troops actually to be sent, it is possible to earmark a Commander and Staffs for the command of such troops as may be sent, and to place them in direct communication with the Italian General Staff to work out plans and to make, arrange-ments in detail for the transport,  supplys and arrival of the troops and their subsequent employmento    I understand from&apos; General J-ivelle that some such arrangements have been made, but 1 am not satisfied that they are either adequate or have been coupletedc    It is in order to ascertain how the matter stands that I&apos; am about to visit General Cadorna, and I have suggested to him that he should ask General lily alls to send
a senior French officer in his confidence to discuss the question with us and settle it. : On my return I shall be able to report to the War Cabinet what has been done.W.R. ROBERTSON/ 17th March,1917. C .1,G,S

6th Maroh, 1916e^ Ra ESBRCITO ITALIMOCOdASSQ SuPREMO   &apos; To General NIVSLLE,Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of theSegreteria . North and North-Eastdel)d.po di Stato-Maggiore, -  of the French Republic.I. 1875 di protocollo G.luI beg to communicate herewith,  confidentially, a telegram ;ent me by the General Officer in charge of the Mission who.represented ie at the Petrograd conference,I believe General de Castelnau&apos;s impressions on the Russian irray, which he will have communicated to you, are not materially lifferent from these?   I should be grateful in any case, if you have no Ejection, if you would let me know what those impressions were, as the :xchange of information forms a very useful element of collaboration jetween our two commands.Specially worthy of consideration seems to me the date ihieh General Ruggeri Laderchi gives as probable for the Russian iffeneive, in so far as it relates to the two following pointsa) the necessity for our effort to take place at the same time on all fronts in order to prevent the enemy from having freedom of movement for his reserves, this being the principal cause of his military successes :b) - the necessity of not leaving the iniative to theenemy.Now the best solution of the strategic problem for the Allies s without doubt to be found in a line of action which would keep the initiative on our side and also involve our all acting at the same imec     And since in all likelihood the Russian offensive is not to
be counted upon before the latter half of May, 1 would -beg you to consider whether it might not be hotter to prepare the offensives on our fronts in every particular and then, instead of launching them at on.ee, keep, them ready until the moment when the situation - by signs which rarely are deceptive -should, show the advisability of forestalling the enemy, by attacking him.This solution therefore, since- it contributes to bring closer as tc time -sur offensives and the Russian, would be all to the advantage of the principle of joint action without detriment, to that of initiative;.This, as far as the general line is concerned. As regards the Italian problem in particular, both examined for itself and also with reference tc its possible reactions on the common cause, it appears to me to be prudent, judging byM-&quot;-&quot;;M&apos;experience, to consider the possibility of the enemyrs giving ground before a victorious offensive on our part but, after overcoming the crisis of the first insuccesses, succeeding in closing the breach formed in his lines and strengthening himself on a front previously well organised for defence.Such positions he could hold - even if only temporarily-With sufficiently small force to enable him to effect considerab removals of men and artillery for sending elsewhere *It is not necessary to ascertain - nor could I do so - If an when this stage cf balance between the opposing forces may be reached on your front j but there, is no doubt that&apos; M other things being equal - it will be put off by just so much&apos; asvycuvput off the beginning of your offensive (relatively to the time you mentioned in our conversation at Udine),     Now this stage of balance should be put off as far as possible if we do not wish the enemy to be already relatively free of anxiety on the Western front and to be able to dispose of his reserves just at the time Y/hen the mountains become practicable and operations on a large scale in the Alpine area become possible.
. .471C I may add that if a hostile attack were tc take shape fromthe Trentino this would, owing to Its highly dangerous strategic direction, paralyze the offensive on the Julian front, whence a considerable withdrawal would be necessary in order to economise the forces and the artillery indispensable to the defence of the threatened front.These considerations also lead one to affirm the necessity for fixing the enemy on all fronts at the same time and, within reasonable limits, as late as possible, with regard to the time when the hills of the Trentino will be free of snow.In conclusion, - and always looking at the situation from an objective standpoint - I am obliged to consider one special aspect of the problem, suggested by the events of the last few days on the Ancre..    The German retreat in this sector may have been the result of tactical requirements, in which case it would have the purely local value of an episode; but it might also - and I put forward this supposition with due reserve -mark the beginning of a new German plan of operation on the western front.It is unnecessary for me to outline this plan, in view of your own keen appreciation of the situation:  I may however mention the possibility that the enemy, by effecting this manoeuvre of retreat on a large radius and withdrawing his front by a few kilometres each time you have contemplated your preparations for attack, should not only avoid the considerable wastage involved by shock and resistance, but also obtain, by the strict defensive economy allowed of by this manoeuvre, considerable forces at his disposal for actuating his plan of offensive on another front.I conclude that if this possibility were to be realised and if the offensive effort were to be turned - as is very likely to be the case - against the Italian front, no advantage could accrue to us through any offensive on your front with a view tc lessening the pressure on ours, and only aid directly rendered could give us any help and constitute a wise use of the common energies against the greatest sum of the enemy&apos;s forces.
472On the various points of which I have here treated andespecially on as much as concerns the enemy situation at present maturing on your front, I should he very grateful for the favour of your enlightened opinion.The Chief of the General Staff of the Army(signed) L;CAD0RNA.
473Sent from London - March 4th 1917 - 1.10 A..M.let.. Question.     Tho Russian -army Is going through a period of regular and active reorganisation and completion, which jt is presumed will end within April next, by which time it is expected that also tho 40 divisions newly formed will be ready-.     The spirit and the staying powers of the troops appear to be very good, owing essentially to. the excellent quality of the soldier and of the fighting officer, although the confidence of the army in the Higher Command is somewhat shaken.   The recent &quot;antiwar11 movement had no following in the bulk of the army and even originated a certain reaction In some of the regiments of the Guard, notwithstanding that these troops mere than the others feel the influence of Court and Capital,,    I may add that with the exception of the fighting in Roumanla, where before the belated arrival of Russian reinforcements the Roumanians showed a very scant resistance., on the remainder of the front the Russian troops appear to have acquired a moral superiority over the enemy..The situation is not in the same degree satisfactory with regard to technical means,  especially if we compare it, with the other allied front *    It has however considerably Improved since last&quot;year, and can be summarised as follows:    Each division has at least six batteries of six guns.    No lack of ammunition for field artillery, of. rifles and cartridges. Number of machine guns satisfactory.-. On the contrary mountain artillery is scarce and trenCh-mortars are almost completely lacking. On the European front they will have in April 2,600 medium and heavy guns,  with abundance of ammunition, against a total of .1,6.0.0 in June last year, I am not taking Into account the artillery which the Russians have asked of the Allies in the present conference-, because it could only be used on the Russian -front towards the end of the year.
4742nd Question.      The Russian Supreme Command intends to develop its offensive with all forces and means at its disposal towards the end of: April.     I have the impression however that a delay of some two to three weeks is inevitable. The intentions of the Russian Supreme Command as to the direction of their principal effort have&apos;not been conveyed to us, nor has it been possible to ascertain them from the measures taken, which are kept strictly secret.     I think however that the great independ-ance enjoyed by the single Commanders of the Groups of Armies, enhanced by the absence of an official Chief of the General Staff, will inevitably lead to a dispersion of means and to several offensives in different sectors of the front, which will take place more or less at the same time according to the conditions of climate in the different sectors.3rd Question.    As to the efficiency of such offensives, though I have no certain or official information on the point,-I think that the improved conditions of armament and the presenc of the new divisions will allow the Russian Army to accomplish a much greater effort than last year, without achieving however, a decisive and final success, owing also to the probable dispersion of means mentioned above.Generale Ruggeri Laderchi Colonnello Greppi ..
475APPENDIX 11* SECRET.p. Prom General Delme Radcliffe to Sir W. Robertson.   March 14th,17*063.;   Secret and personal.- This evening I saw General Cadorna in Val Lagarina. He greatly regrets that you wore unable to come as previously arranged, but hopes that you can come between March 20th and 24th- He would be grateful to have by telegraph your views on the memorandum ho sent you, which was a translation of the memorandum he sent to General ITivolio.General Cadorna thinks that the Gorman retirement on Western front., if continued., will have created a new situation^- He thinks Germans will not be averse to surrendering some French or Belgian territory if by so doing they are enabled to obtain other advantages * lie thinks Gorman troops may retire 6 or 8 kilometres at a time on previously prepared successive positions,  and using inferior forces may avoid defeat in the V/cst for some months and economise many Divisions for employment elsewhere.   General Cadorna thinks this a sound manoeuvre; and one that he would endeavour to carry out were he in the position of the Germans,.    If the Germans decide to attack they may; with Austrian Amy, havo about 90 Divisions available for the purpose which, with a very superior artillery, would be overwhelming. If Germans adopt retard-ing tactics he thinks British and-French attempts to relieve Italy by attacking in the West might not achieve their object, and that the only effective help would be by means of direct support in Italy of about 20 French or British Divisions with plenty of heavy artillery.  In a few weeks it should be-possible to make sure what are the German intentions, but time is short for making fresh arrangements, and C-onf Cadorna thinks that steps should be taken-at once so that, in case of necessity, French or British reinforce-monts may reach Italy in time and under conditions allowing of their immediate employments He points out that operations are feasible in the Trentino probably by May 15th, possibly by May 1st.but
47Appendix II. (contdo)but certainly not before April 15th.   On the Isonao front he could begin operations at once, but&quot;cannot engage himself there too deeply until the situation is clear as regards Trentino. He thinks that if some SO French or British Divisions are ear-  &quot; marked for (group omitted) in Italy and if steps arc taken immediately to work out a plan of operations, liaisons, recon-naissances, transport, etc., it would be possible to forestall and defeat any attempt the Central Powers might make against Italy as the French and Italian Railway Communications would permit of more rapid concentration than those of the Central Powers,, even as far as the Isonzo.There is at present no proof of a German concentration near the Italian Front, but Austrians have made elaborate preparations in the matter of railway communications, roads and supply, which would render such concentration possible.    Many Indications now confirm, the idea that an Austro-German combination against Italy is at least probable.General Cadorna thinks it advisable that the above should be seriously considered, as a defeat of Italian Army would be a severe blow to the Entente, more especially as certain influences in the country might then be successful in bringing about a separate peace.S
