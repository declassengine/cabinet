Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.MEMORANDUM.On lOtli November 1916 the War Office asked that every effort be e for the release&apos; of white troops from minor theatres for service on the main fronts, and suggested that the question of raising additional units from the fighting races in India should be taken up at once.The purport of this request was communicated to the Government of India and followed with suggestions for the release of Territorials either without relief or in exchange for Garrison battalions or by being replaced by Volunteer Corps which would have to be mobilised.In reply-to these telegrams the Government of India formulated a scheme^ the details of which are given in their telegrams Nos. 13943 and 13914 of 30th&apos; November, and which amounted to the following :-1, Release of 12 Territorial battalions (to he replaced by six Garrisonbattalions and embodied Volunteers). 2. Release of 13 Service battalions from 13th Division (to he replaced byan Indian Division of   three British battalions and 10 Indianbattalions).3. Expansion of three Indian battalions in Egypt to six battalions&apos;.In order to carry out this scheme they required the following measures to be taken at once.I. Passing of an Ordinance for compulsory training of Europeans.II. Supply by War Office of reinforcements for British units remainingin India.III. Supply by War Office of guns, rifles, equipment, &amp;c, required.IV. Release by War Office of Indian Army British officers.V. Grant of concessions to stimulate recruiting.   (Most of these have been granted.)On referrino- this telegram, to the War Office, the Army Council replied that they would give their immediate attention to the provision of six Garrison battalions and items II. and 111. of the above measures.As regards item IV., they stated that India should ask for the individual officers they required, and that the release of each individual would be considered on its merits.The one item, however, about which there was considerable doubt wa&amp; ,the supply of rifles, of which the Government of India had demanded 169,000.The contents of this letter, dated 12th December, were communicated to India in our telegram of 19th December, and in their telegram of 29th December they pointed out : I. That a Territorial, battalion would be released on the arrival of eachof the six Garrison battalions. II. That drafts for British units should include three months&apos; wastageof 8 per cent, per month. III. That the rate at which Indian battalions could be made available for service overseas would depend on the supply of rifles, of which 40,000 should be sent out at once, and on the release of Indian Army officers by the War Office.The entire correspondence was then considered by the War Cabinet and the Government of India were directed to proceed with the &quot; raising of new &quot; battalions as proposed in your telegram of 30th November in anticipation &quot; of provision of rifles.&quot;   (Telegram No. 13 of 2nd January 1917.)The telegram expressed the hope that &quot; additional troops [i.e., white troops).may be ready for service in Egypt in August next,&quot; and asked,for report as to ;&apos; what you can do.&quot;In the meantime the &quot;following action has been taken : MS 381

An Ordinance for the compulsory training of Europeans has been issued.B. By the War Office.This is summarised in their letter of 26th January below and amounts to the following : -I; Supply of rifles. Their letter stated that 110,000 rifles would be sent by end of March. (As a matter of fapt 71,500 were shipped by the&apos;end of February and 100,000 are being sent direct to India from Vancouver and are expected to arrive, at Bombay by .18th June.II. All equipment required will be supplied on receipt of detailedstatement.III. Mechanical transport will be supplied as required.&quot;IV. Five Garrison battalions will be sent as soon as possible (three havealready started). The sixth Garrison battalion has been dispensed with in consequence of the release of the 80th Carnatics by the Ceylon Government. V. Drafts to the extent required are promised. VI. The release of-Indian Army Officers has been taken in hand. (The full number required are about to be sent to India and some have already sailed.)The War Office also requested the Secretary of State for India to enquire what number of men suitable for employment with mechanical and horsed transport could, be enlisted in India for service in Salonika, Egypt, or France and also&quot; whether competent artificers could be procured, and desired stress . to be laid on the importance of releasing white personnel from these duties for service in the fighting line.In reply the Government of India intimated that they were prepared to-send from their depots -100 men trained to ride and drive by end of February and a further 150 by middle of March and have since intimated that 420 drivers will be despatched on the 13th March. Personnel for mechanical motor transport is not obtainable in India. ^In addition to the above the Government of India were asked whether they could furnish from non-fighting races corps of 50,000 labourers with a view to economising man-power in this country and&quot; in France.The Government of India at once took the necessary steps and asked, for sanction to their authorising Local Governments to begin the recruit-ment of a first instalment of 20,000 labourers. The War Office, who were referred to, have intimated their preparedness to accept these men for service in France provided only such-men are. selected as can stand the climate of North-west Europe. As regards the balance of 30,000 the War Office are apparently uncertain whether they can utilise their services and have asked that only such preliminary steps be taken as would involve no expenditure, with a view to raising this additional number if and when required.   Instructions to this effect have been sent to India.0. H. S. .5th March 1917.1 r.e., to Mesopotamia to relieve British battalions of 13th Division.
