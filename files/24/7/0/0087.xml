339COPYSECRETWAR.....QABIST, G.T. 187 &apos; - ---P.   Prom General Hanbury Williams to Sir W, Robertson.March 14th, 1917No. 832.Although I have telegraphed twice to the Embassy, I cannot get an answer from them regarding the situation in Petrograd.     Reports from the Prench and Italians, who had been in communication with their Embassies, are varying, but what does appear to be certain is that the Minister of War is Colonel Englehart under the Provisional Government, at the head of which is   Rodzianko.The Grand Duke Serge sent for, me this afternoon and asked if I had any news and what I thought generally of the situation.     I told him that I had received no news.     X was informed by him that Moscow and Kronstad were in complete accord with the movement in Petrograd, and that similar demonstrations had occurred in support of the new Government.Bolaieff was still in communication with the Staff here up to noon yesterday.The two Socialist Members of the new Government were in complete agreement with the other Members as regards con-tinuing the war, but there was a small party of extremists against, who had no prospect of success.     Orders which have been issued by the Hew Government to the Army call upon all to continue their duties as usual.Meanwhile, the Emperor&apos;s train with the Emperor inside has been held up it seems near Pskov, where he can communi-cate with General Russki, but is allowed to proceed no further.The Grand Duke asked me&apos;what I thought should be done, and whether I did not think His Majesty should agree to accept the New Government.     I said, Yes, and further that after consideration during the preceding night decided to write personally to the Emperor, first having submitted it to Alexeieff for approval.     He asked me if I could let him have a. copy which I have since sent,   I told him, however, the nature of the contents and he said he thought it was most necessary to telegraph it at once.He also informed me that the Grand Duke Alexander, when he was in Petrograd during the Conference, had been to see hot the Emperor and the Empress^    He warned them of the dangerous state of the country.     The latter would, not believe, and he said that she had letters to prove the contrary.     The Duke then left them remarking that it was hopeless to argue the matter.(One group undecipherable)   Grand Duke Serge tells (? words omitted) has three months supplies to hand but that meanwhile there was much delay at works owing to present position.&apos;letter to the Emperor is as follows:-   &quot;Your Imperial Majesty knows full well that I should not venture to
3902approach Your Majesty at this time nor indeed at any other time &quot;by the form of letter, were it not that my devotion to both the Emperor and the Impress of Russia impels me so to do. I am neither a diplomatist nor a politician (one group undeci-pherable) old soldier who has seen much of both sides of the British Skapire as well as of war.     Russia I know well is a country which does not admit of treatment in the same way as other countries, but in all countries there are times (four groups undecipherable) &quot;velvet glove over the iron hand&quot;. I hear a good deal and I say little but I consider quietly and in my judgment, for what it is worth, of matters now, when above all considerations I know that it is nearest Your Majesty1a heart to end this war by victory, there is danger that the Army which is devoted to the Gause of beating the Germans may say:     We cannot continue to fight against the Germans if we have to fight against our own people and if for that purpose we are to be withdrawn from the front.It overlooks the fact that Your Majesty and those around you are as keen to win the war as any soldier in the ranks. It is ignorant of the fact that old and trusted servants like Count Frederiks are at heart true Russians.Your Majesty&apos;s position is that of an autocrat but in these days an autocrat can govern, only . with   the advice of good councillors and the people want to feel that these councillors are now chosen from among the people themselves: in all the troubles that I have seen in different countries it has always been found the best plan to have an outlet -it is like an inflammatory growth in the body which v/ants piercing that the poison may escape.Free talk in the Parliament or Duma seems to be the outlet, so that they can feel that the men whom they send to the Emperor1s councils can express their feelings.No doubt German mischief is at the bottom of what was spoken now but it would conquer that German mischief if it was said to the people that Your Majesty trusted them to advise you a3 to the necessary action to be taken at the present time in that you accept the Government appointed by them.It seems to me that the moment has come when it is necessary to appeal to the peoples of Russia to assist you in the heavy task which lies on your shoulders.     I know full well that in thus approaching your Majesty I am liable to be told that it is not my business and that I should return to my own country, but I have absolute belief and trust that Your Majesty is devoted to the Allied cause and it is only with that cause at heart and my determined and sincere devotion to both Your Majesties that I venture to take what may be a most improper action and even at my own risk of dismissal.But whatever happens no one can say that there is one man in Russia of Allies or the Russians more devoted to the welfare of their country.   I have served here to the best of my ability since the beginning of the war with just the same devotion to Your Majesty as I (? group omitted) my own King and it is only with equal devotion to both Emperor and King that I venture to write this letter.     I trust Your Majesty may forgive me for what may appear to you a most improper way of writing&quot; .I am well aware that I have incurred great responsibility in writing thus, but in view of entire agreement of both Grand Duke and Alexeieff I am willing to bear the responsibility and take the risks.
3I hope you do not think I have done wrong and trust that King and Government may approve my action.It was of course impossible in the limited time to communicate with the Ambassador but I will do so as soon as possible.      I have made no mention to my colleagues here of any of this.
