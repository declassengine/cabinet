VT   OP   THE   PRESIDMT   OP   THE   BOARD   OP   EDUCATION.Generally, the Department has &quot;been engaged in the- development., f the Educational proposals which have been sanctioned &quot;by the ar cabinet.The Board are negotiating with the Ministry of pensions with -egard to the provision of training for disabled soldiers and hope ioon to be in a position to submit to the Treasury an agreed iroposal for the financing of such training.In accordance with the instructions of the War Cabinet, I am jonferring with the Director of Timber supplies with regard to the Employment of boys between 16 and 16 years of age in woodcutting.I have obtained reports from my inspectors with regard to the part which the public Elementary schools are talcing, or preparing to take, in helping to increase the Pood Supply.     The investiga-tions show that most local Education Authorities are fully alive to the importance of the matter and are taking vigorous measures to ensure that all school gardens and allotments in their areas are used to the full and to secure additional land for the purpose where-ever possible.     I am impressing on the few Authorities who have done little hitherto the necessity for taking similar action immediately.I have received communications from various sources suggesting that, in view of the serious shortage of teachers caused by the War, the Code of Regulations for public Elementary Schools should be modified so as to permit Ministers of Religion to assist in the work 0f the Schools.     After consultation with the leaders of various Denominations I am justified in believing that there is a general desire that during the period of the War no person should be debarred from teaching in a public Elementary School by reason only of his being a Clerk in Holy Orders or the regular Minister of a Congregation.     I accordingly propose to give effect to this desire, 0uoject to certain safeguards and limitations.9th Larch, 1917.
