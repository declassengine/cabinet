The vfithdrawal of the enemy on the ANCRE points to possible changes in the general situation which rcaxuire careful consideration.   This withdrawal may be a first step in a more considerable rearward movement on a much wider front; evidence in favour of this view grows stronger daily.By taking up a line running from the neighbourhood of ARRAS - or possibly from the outskirts of the LILLE defences by ST. QUENTIN. LA FEREJ; and LAON. and thence southwards, the enemy would shorten his front by many miles, thereby setting free several divisions for offensive purposes.We have information that ouch a line (known as the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; line) has already been prepared, at any rate on a considerable portion of the front named, and that the enemy has had very large numbers of men working on it for come weeks pact.     Evidence that further work is being pushed on continues to reach me, and we have had previous experience of the rapidity with which the Germans are capable of completing strong defensive lines,   A close study of the possibilities to which present indications point leads to the following conclusions :-(a)       Probability of a Gorman offensive.The Germans are whole-hearted believers in the principle that an offensive on the greatest possible scale, driven home   with the utmost rapidity, violence, and determination, is;the only method of forcing a quick decision,O.A.P, 323. SECRET   and &apos; U R G E N T.2nd March, 1917.REVIEW OF PRESENT SITUATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT1? WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE GERMAN WITHDRAWAL ONTHE ANCRE.
From what we know of the internal ; state of Germany, it is reasonable to expect that she will do her utmost to force a: deeds ion as soon as possible in whatever way/seems most likely to promise a German success*   It is also to be noted that in a - recently captured order signed by Hindenburg the necessity to restore the waning spirit of the German infantry is emphasized.    There is no method of dbing this so -effective as preparation for an execution of an.offensive in great numbers and under conditions con-sidered to be &quot;favourable . &quot;(b)     The - probable;methods of applying the above-prlnciplos .-whichiseems likely to be adopted by the , Germans.- It.is to:be. - expected:that-the enemy.would put the greatest possible.force.into-his. offensive on whatever. Tront he selects for it, and ,that clsev-hero he would limit his action to gaining sufficient time for this offensive to -. reach a. decis ion*;&apos; He - would seek, to shorten that time both . by employing the. greates t possible.. force and by. the violence of his attack; - while the measuresto be taken on his defensive fronts would bo very carefully calculated and thoroughly prepared - eConom-- of force on those fronts being of great importance to the success of his-plan.In deciding on the means to employ to delay any decision sought for by the allies on his defensive fronts, while himself endeavouring to for(5e one elsewhere, the enemy would doubtless be glad to r ely on some less costly and less exhausting method than he. employed; on the SOMME..By creating a strong system of defence at some distance in rear of his. existing, linos and by f irhting rear-: guard actions in. the. intervening space, gradually falling back on the prepared- system,behind, considerable time might be:, gained without great - loss .   The action which the enemy appears to be taking no.  points to an intention to act on
this principle^ If that he his intention, . the offensive preparations already made by the. allies : on. the Western . front might he rendered entirely nugatory..Their attack when launched, at any rate on a.&apos;considerable portion cf the offensive front, would become little more than a blew in the ;airV   They would be compelled &apos;to push back the -enemy&apos; s rearguards,.under conditions for which he would he fully prepared, until.-they, reached his main- line of defence behind, .when:fresh preparations-for attack would have to be made, entailing considerable delay.Such a scheme cf defence, followed by a counter-attack,  or in combination with a groat offensive elsewhere, would bo entirely in accordance with sound principles and with the . enemy&apos;s usual methods.-(c)    The enemyfj3 chpipe of f ront for,an offen s i v o *,fo may suppose that the enemy would consider the prospects of tactical success to be greater on the Russian than on the v/o stern front, but strategically it would be difficult to turn such success to full account on the Russian front unless the internal state of lussia is judged to be such that considerable German tactical success would load to her immediate ccllapso.-On the V/estern front these conditions would seem to be reversed.    Tactical success would be harder to gain, but if gained on a groat scale the strategical results to be expected would probably be more rapid and more decisive.In addition to these considerations the enemy&apos;, cannot overlook - the groat:efforts required last year to hold the allied offensive on the \/estorn front,.and ho would probably calculate on finding it easier and less costly to.hold a Russian offensive in check.In short, the weight.of argument seems to be in favour of the Western&apos;fror- being selected for a GermanOffensive
offensive rather than the Eastern or any other front.(d):; - Choice of time..The prospects of a decisive tactical success for the Germans, on the Western front, would undoubtedly he greatest if their attack were launched at a moment when the reserves of the French and British Armies had already been committed to an offensive on some, other portion of the front - always provided the Allied attack could he held in check unt11 the German attack had gained a decision. Sue cess under such conditions would depend very much(i)   On the relative value of the troops opposing theGerman; attack: on the one hand and the Allied attack &apos; .    on.the other. ; . . :: . :V : .: (1i)   On:the corapleteness and strength^of thepreparations made oh the respective defensivefronts. ^r^k-^:.: oo far as preparations go, we must calculate on theGermans having omitted no. precaution - offensive or defensive- necessary to give their plans/ the: best chance of success-We may feel assured that all possibilities will have beenc are fully c ons xdered, and that, having once entered on theexecution of his plan,, the enemy will see it through with theutmost determination to success or failure.(e)     A s suming the German attack to he on the We st ern Front, which, part of it is most likely to be; chosen.&quot;e have no certain indications as yet on this point;, but there can be no doubt that an attack between LILLE and -the sea: presents many and great attractions to the enemy, and rumours and warnings of an intended German Offensive, on a great scale, in that area, continue to.reach me.In my opinion there is no part of the Western front more likely - probably none so likely - to be selected
by the enemy for an attempt to snatch victory at the last moment by a great and decisive effort.The YPRES sector is difficult to defend and its security depends very much on the staunchness of the Belgian troops on my left, over whose arrangements and dispositions I have no control,.A considerable tactical success by the Germans in this area, especially at a moment when my reserves, or a considerable portion of thorn, were already committed else-where, might have the most serious consequences.    It would turn my left flank and threaten to cut me off within a few days from the three ports in northern France on which I rely for a considerable proportion of. my requirements.   The valufe to the enemy of these ports - especially as against Great Britain - would he enormous and the/whole.-, enterprise would fit .In admirably, from the enemy1 s point of. view, with his., -schemes : of - submarine warfare .The YPRES sector has. s.lw&amp;ys baen a source of special anxiety to the British Cr*mmander-in-Chief^ and recent evento nave added considerably to these, anxieties.My centre of gravity hns been shifted southwards by the extension of my line recently ordered and now completed The railways on which I should be so dependent on an emergency arc not ixnder my control and it has become evident that I car, plauo no reliance on thesm.    By the recent decision of the War Cabinet at the CALAIS conference Imay find myself deprived of the disposal of my reserves at the critical moment.. and even as regards the general disposition of my troops on the British front during the preparatory period my hands have been tiod; to some extent.(f)   General summary zf the situation and deductions.It cannot be doubted that the enemy is preparing-        &quot; for .  .
for an effort this year oh the greatsst possible scaleWhether it be his final effort or not, it will certainly be impressed on his men that the result of the war depends greatly on its success., - that if it is pushed   ; home regardless of loss it will succeed, -\and that if it succeeds Germany will be completely victoriouss,  With the.help of his new divisions and of economy of force on his defensive fronts the enemy can undoubtedly mass very large forces for an offensives.    His excellent system of defences, and the growing, probability that he has arranged to gain time by evading, the weight of an allied blow, may enable him&apos; to carry through his offensive to a definite decision before the allied attack: has gained one. In the circumstances we cannot doubt that the enemy -will  .-;-:&apos;&apos;,-have weighed-all the possibilities,: calculated;.&apos;time con- --ditions, and made thorough -and timely:preparations to carry out his plan &quot;whatever-it.may be, regardless of our action,.; It was thus that he acted in August, 1914, and the-French counter: offensive did not cause, him to. diverge for a moment: from; his purpose, :.:-Are we justified on relying on the proposed allied - attack this, spring:;.turning him from his purpose, whatever that may be, before he has carried it through to success or failure? - v-;/; &apos;      \ VLO^^:;;e:.,;.In my opinion the; information so far available does not justify a final decision now on thirs point. - We are net reliably Informed as to how far the enemy;&apos;s - pre par--a t i on s for fur the r w ithdr awal; - if int e nde d - have - bee n . completed, though there is some reason to suspect, that they may be further advanced than appears from reconnaissance. It may be the same with his preparations for an offensive. -An acceleration of the intended allied offensive, . -is, I-understand, possible for the French.     If an attack  . can be delivered by them at an early date,;it might fall on
the enemy before he is ready for it and upset his plans. There is nc certainty of this however, and my power of combining with such an attack in the near future would be very limited, my preparations having been considerably delayed by various circumstances beyond my control.If there is to be no acceleration af the allied, attack the situation will be clearer before the time arrives for it to be launched, and judgment can be postponed for the present.Meanwhile, on the present indications, I consider that the safety of the British Armies might be gravely endangered if I were to commit my forces beyond recall -to any enterprise which would deprive me of the power to meet developments which appear to me to be possible, and perhapseven probable.For these reasons I consider that until the enemy&apos;s intentions become clearer sufficient reserves must be retained in my own hands, and especially in the Second Army area, to meet whatever action it is reasonably possible for the enemy to &quot;take..     I also consider it necessary to divert to tho Second Army area the labour required to repair and develop the successive lines of defence behind my lines (for the maintenance of which nc labour has been available for some time) and to repair reads and develop railway c on stru c t ion aIre a dy planne d.The steps taken in the above directions must be reduced to the minimum considered essential for the time being, and the offensive preparations already in hand will be pushed on to the utmost extent of the resources remaining at my disposal.But
But some reduction in the secle of my preparation or extra time- to complete them, will, I fear, be unaybidabl and if the situation develops unfavourably for the proposed offensive it may become necessary to abandon it.(Signed)     D. Hair..&apos; Fie 1 d - Ma r s ha 1,, Commanding-ih-C hie f, British Armies in France.?nd March, 1917.
