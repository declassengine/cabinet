Political Situe/cioiij  bythe (l.QY rnineat  01  India-,  dated 2.9th December.,  1936*          Circulated  or  the information o-x the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
   Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation    in India, dated the 29th December 1936, issued on    the authority of the Secretary of State for India.          The news of the constitutional crisis in Englandhas been received quietly in India, although the episodecaused much concern to the Indian Press and to the public generally, and some difficulty was felt in appreciating the exact nature of the issues involved.   An outstanding featurehas &quot;been the dignity and restraint of the Indian Press inits allusions to the matter, and the excellent tone of allreferences to the Throne.         At the end of November it became necessary toundertake military operations on the North-West Frontier. the trouble was caused by the Faqir of Ipi, who had taken up hisresidence among the tribal elements in Lower Khaisora Valley,where he was carrying on anti-Government propaganda.  TheTori Khel Maliks expressed their inability to control his activities unless the G-overnment gave some indication of their intention to avail themselves of the rights guaranteed by a former agreement with the tribe, by which the Khaisora Valleyhad been opened to movement of Government troops in return forallowances and other benefits.          It was therefore decided to send 2 columns of troops on a march into the Khaisora valley in the hope of stiffeningthe pro-government party.  No punitive or offensive measures were contemplated.   The troops entered&apos; the valley on the25th November 1936 but were attacked by considerable numbersof tribesmen.   After reaching their objective,  they withdrewon the 27th November to Mir Ali.   As a result of these attacks on government forces the Government of India havedecided to undertake certain military operations in the area.It was announced to tribal representatives and jirgas on the
2nd December that government forces would march into theKhalsora Valley and remain there as long as government considered necessary; that a road or roads would heconstructed from Mir All into and within the KhaisoraValley; that government would exact fines in rifles andother penalties from those sections and other tribes whohave made war against government and that if governmentforces were opposed the hostile tribesmen must he preparedto take the consequences.    Accordingly, government troopsmoved southward from Mir Ali on December 5th, 1936,and the construction of a road into Khaisora Valley isprogressing.  Very little opposition has so far been encountered.          Crop reports generally continue to be satisfactorya&amp;d in most provinces crops above normal are expected.  Thesituation in the affected areas of the Bombay Presidencyhas been greatly relieved by the rain.  Hailstorms in the punjab and heavy rains in part of the Central Provinceshas caused some damage to crops.  It is now reported that189 people were killed by the cyclone in the Guntur district of Madras.         Interest in the country is now centred on the comingelections and there has been very little other political activity.  Electioneering activity has generally increased and the selection of candidates has made considerable progress, but there have been few new developments affectingthe balance of parties and other groups contesting theelections,.         The effect of Nehru&quot;s visit to Bengal in order toestablish a united front appears to have been short-livedand the two main groups of Congress adherents have again
fallen out over the selection of candidates.  In theNorth West Frontier Province, and the United Provinces thereare signs of more concerted  effort on the part of theparties opposed to Congress to improve their organisation.In Madras the Justice Party has attained a considerable success in the district local board election, by way of a reply to the success of Congress in obtaining a majority on the Madras Municipal Corporation.   In the latter body,the Congress majority have been obliged to implement their former pledges by reducing the salaries of higher paidmunicipal servants to a maximum of Rs,500 and this action will not, it appears, improve their prospects elsewhere.The natural tendency of Congress, as the best organisedparty, has been to attract to itself candidates whoseallegiance is merely nominal, and Congress leaders have thought it necessary to express their disapproval of theadoption of such candidates by Local Parliamentary boards in order to obtain an artificial majority, which will not guarantee real support for the Congress programme after theelections are over.       Meanwhile preparations are in progress for the nextannual session of Congress which is to be held at Faizpurin the East Khandesh District.  The election of a Presidentof Congress for the ensiling year has drawn forth a seriesof published statements from various candidates, which haverevealed considerable differences of opinion?  The prospectof Nehru&apos;s re-election to office, which has since become a fact,  has caused some alarm to those who were not preparedto accept the implication that Congress would be pledged tosocialism and non-acceptance of office, and a difficult situation was only averted by relegating these items  to the
background and emphasising the main objective of Congress,namely, the wrecking of the new constitution.  The questionof office acceptance has been postponed until after theelections and is not even to be discussed at Faizpur.But this decision has caused some uneasiness and some of the production-Congress papers are already asking what particularprogramme is implied in support of Congress at the elections.      The improvement in the communal situation in Bombaycity continued throughout the month, but isolated attackscontinue to occur.  The total casualties from the beginningof the riots up to December 7th have been 93 killed and632 injured, and the number of persons arrested has been2,477.  The opening of the Sabha Mandap at Maruti Temple,which was the bone of contention, took place quietly onDecember 3rd amidst full military and police precautions,and there is reason to hope that, with the conclusion  Of thisceremony, excitement will disappear.
