THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OH HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .     Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Scotland.     1.  A Bill to amend the law with regard to the grounds on whichdecrees  of divorce can be granted in Scotland has been introduced by Lord  Alness in the House of Lords and is likely to be put down for Second Reading soon after Parliament reassembles.may at present be&apos; granted (a) lunacy for three years,, (b) cruelty(c) penal servitude (d) three convictions for crime involving onesentence of at least 6 months imprisonment., (e) habitual drunkennessor addiction to drugs, (f)  sodomy and bestiality.   It proposesalso to reduce from four years to three, the period of desertionwhich is held to justify divorce;  to modify the definition ofdesertion&apos;;  and,  in the case of divorce on the ground of lunacy,to empower the court to require special provision to be made fromthe defender7s estate for the maintenance of the pursuer and thechildren of. the marriage or the payment by the pursuer of a contribution to the defenderTs support.     2. These provisions are in some cases comparable to those contained in the Marriage Bill at present under consideration in theHouse of Commons;  in some cases they go somewhat further;  and in  onethey propose to bring the Scottish law into line with the existing  lawin England.   Lord Alness  has not, it is true, adopted a number of highly contentious proposals which the English Bill contains,  but i feel that the two measures are sufficiently similar in subject andsoope to render it desirable that the Government attitude to bothshould at any rate at the present stage be as nearly as possiblethe same.SECRETCP.  7(57)CABIN E 3?.DIVORCE  ( SCOTLAND) BILL /JE.L .JThe Bill proposes to add to the grounds on which divorce
8th January,  1937.     3.  The Cabinet will recall that on 18th November (Cabinet 66(36), Conclusion 12) it was decided that on the Second Reading of the English  Bill the Attorney General should adopt a neutral but not &quot;cold shouldering&quot; attitude, should point out in what respects -the Bill agreed with and differed from the findings of the Royal Commission, and should indicate that in the event of its being given a Second Reading, a law officer should be available to assist the Committee.   On 2nd December (Cabintt69 (36)  Conclusion 11) the Cabinet decided that the Attorney General in Committee should.avoid expressing even a personal view on the points that arose and should content himself with explaining the consequences which would arise on one side or the other from the proposals in the Bill.        I would propose that on the Second Reading and in committee (if the Scottish Bill is given a SecondReading)  therepresentative - of the Scottish Office in the House of Lords shouldbe authorised to take a similar line.   This seems to me desirablenot only on the general ground of uniformity to which I  have already referred, but because there has not hitherto been any evidence of a demand in Scotland for divorce reform and no opportunity has- occurred of ascertaining Scottish opinion on the proposals  of-Lord Alness&apos; Bill.        I would propose also that as in the case of the  EnglishBill, Cabinet Ministers and the Scottish Office representatives in the House of Lords should not vote on the Second Reading ofLord Alness1 Bill.
