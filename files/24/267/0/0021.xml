COMMITTEE OH MINISTERS &apos;  SALARIES..                           &apos;&apos;-&apos;  &apos;&quot;&apos; ,REPORT.          1.      At their  Meeting on 11th November,  1936  (Cabinet  64(36)          Conclusion 6)  the  Cabinet  agieed  inter  alia that  a Cabinet          Committee under  the Chairmanship  of the Home Secretary should         be  set up to recommend to  the Cabinet the  heads of a  Bill          dealing with Ministers&apos;  Salaries  ana connected  questions.         This  Committee was  subsequently constituted as  follows:-                        The  Home  Secretary (In the  Chair)                        The  Lord  President of the  Council                        The  Chancellor of  the Exchequer                        The  Lox-d  Privy Seal                        The  First Lord of  the Admiralty                        The  Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries                        The  president  of the  Board  of Education         2.      We  hive examined  the following questions falling  within         our Terms  of Reference:-                        (a)  Ministerial Salaries                        (B)  Salary of the  Leader of  the Opposition                        (C)  Pensions  for  ex-Ministers                        (D)  Limit on  the  number of Secretaries of                             State ana Under  Secretaries of State who                             may sit in the House of  Commons *         3.      The King1s Speech on the Opening of Parliament                 on  era November, 1936,  contained the  following                 reference to this subject.               &quot;A Bill will  also be laid before you to remove certain         anomalies  in the  present standing of Ministers by adjustments         ana alterations in  their salaries, ana for other purposes.&quot;                                 -1-copy no.
      In his speech ID.  the  Debate on  the  Address  the. Leader of the Opposition said -          &quot;I welcome the fact that the  question of      Ministerial salaries  is to  be reviewed.,,   We have      waited a long time for that Measure^  and. in the      past Governments  have undoubtedly been hampered by      the need for the  rigid allocation of  Ministers to      seats due to their historic status  or to the -      particular salaries which they  carry a     If that      matter is dealt withy  I hope that there  may be reform      on another matter at  the same time  -             MR, STEPHEN:  The means test.            MR, ATTLEE:   If the hon,-Member will  have      patience I will come  to that.   I was referring to      the. &quot;allocation of Ministers between the  two Houses,,      I think that the  rigid rules which  apply in the      case of the Secretary of State  and  the Under-      Secretary of State often hamper the more convenient      arrangement of Ministers^&quot;      It may be assumedf  therefore, that  tho Labour Partsr are favourable in principle to a review of Ministerial salaries and to some relaxation of the rules regulating the allocation  of Ministers  between the  two Houseso    ^t will  be noted that  Mr. Attlee made no reference to Ministerial pensions.4.     The questions mentioned in paragraph 2 canconveniently be separately considered.    This report is concerned with questions  (A),   (B)  and  (C).    a supplementary Report (CP.  29  (37)) to be  circulatedshortly will contain our conclusions regarding question (D)                 (A) M i n i s t e r 1 a I J5 a lar ies  .5.     The Question  of the remuneration of Ministers wasconsidered by  Select Committees  of the House  of Commons in1920 and  in 1930.  No action was  in fact  taken on the
report of these Committees.  Appendix I to the Reportof the 1930 Committee contained a list of ministerial salaries showing the salaries prevailing in November,1920 and in February, 1930 respectively.  The presentposition is very similar to that of 1950 and is shown inCol. 1 of Annex I to this Report.6.     Broadly speaking, in the case of the older Officesthe Ministerial salaries are non-statutory, while in thecase of the more recently created Offices, e.g. theMinister of Health, the Ministerial salaries are prescribed by statute.7.     We can find no justification for continuing thisdistinction, and on general grounds we see considerable advantage in dealing fully and comprehensively with thewhole matter in the new legislation by including in theBill the salaries of all Ministers, including those of under Secretaries and other subordinate Ministers..  Ifthe inclusion in the Bill of a complete list of salaries for Ministers of the status of Under Secretary would belikely to prolong discussion and provoke many amendments,the schedule, so far as Under Secretaries are concerned,might be limited to those whole salaries would be alteredunder the scale now proposed,8.     In this connection we have considered the questionwhether it might not be advisaole to exclude altogether from the scheme the Lord Chancellor and the Law officers for England and Wales and for Scotland respectively.The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers are in a some-what different position from it her Ministers. The lord chancellor&apos;s pension is already provided for him, andthere appears to us to be no justification for bringing the Law Officers within the scope of any Ministerial                  -3-
          pension  proposals, because  on ceasing to be Law Officers          they either become Judges or can resume their practice at          the  Bar  with  the  advantages attaching to the fact that they          are  ex Law Officers.   The  exclusion of the Lord Chancellor          from the scheme will  render It unnecessary to alter the way.          in which the  Lord Chancellor?s remuneration is at present          expressed, namely  6000 per annum  as Lord Chancellor, and a          further   4000  per annum as  Speaker  of the Hetise ef Lords.          Having regard to  the  fact that Lords of Appeal receive  6000          per  annum, it  might seem unnatural  if the Lord Chancellor&apos;s          remuneration  as Lord  Chancellor was expressed at a figure          lower than that amount.   For these reasons we recommend          that  the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General, the          Solicitor-General, the Lord Advocate,, and the Solicitor-          General  for Scotland, should be altogether excluded from the          scheme relating to Ministerial sal Fries&apos;, etc., that no          alteration, should be  made in the arrangement at present in          force regarding their respective emoluments, and that in          particulrr no  change  should be made in the way in which the          Lord.Chancellor7s remuneration is  now expressed, namely as           6000 per annum as Lord Chancellor plus a further  4000          per  annum as  Speaker  of the House  cf Lords.erne  for    9.     We have embodied our conclusions in regard toasterialJries.    Ministerial salaries  in the following scheme, which we          submit to the  Cabinet for adoption  :               (l) The Bill to  cover  all Ministerial salaries                  other  than those of the Lord Chancellor, the                 Attorney-General, the Saiicitor-General, the                 Lord Advocate/ the  Solicitor-General for Scotland.                 If the inclusion in the Bill of a complete list                 of salaries for Ministers  of the status, of Under                 Secretary would be  likely  to prolong discussion                 and provoke many amendments, the schedule, so far                 as Under  Secretaries are concerned, might be
  limited to those whose^e salaries would he altered  under the scale now proposed.(8) The salary received &quot;by all Cabinet Ministers  (except the Prime Minister) to be  5000 a year.   If  the Minister by virtue of his Office is not receiving  the frill figure, e0g. as Minister of Transport,  his  salary to be made up to  5000 so long as he is in  the Cabinet.(3) The salary sf the Prime Minister to be  10,000 a  year.   We have considered whether a part of this  salary (say  8,500 a year) should be expressed as a  (non-taxable) allowance for entertaining.  We think,  however, that it would probably be more satisfactory  if the Prime Minister&apos;s salary was expressed simply  as  10,000 a year,(4) At present the emoluments of the Chancellor of the  Duchy of Lancaster are paid out of the revenues  of  the Duchy.   In the event of a Chancellor of the  Duchy of Lancaster becoming a member of the Cabinet  we recnrprfiend that the additional amount required to  raise his remuneration to  5000 per annum should be  met from Public Funds,  and that a provision to this&apos;  effect should be included in the Bill.(5)  A list of the present Ministerial salaries is  set  out in Column 1 of Annex I to this&apos; Report,   Column 2  of Annex I is a list showing Ministerial salaries  payable  in future if our recommendations are adopted  &quot;by the Cabinet.    Cases where alterations of salary  are recommended are  marked in Column 2 with an  asterisk and may be  summarised as follows :

The question whether the fixed salary of theChancellor cf the Duchy of Lancaster should be similarlyincreased is a matter for consideration by the Councilof the Duchy.as it is borne on Duchy revenues.
  trliamentary      (6)  We recommend theft the Parliamentary and Financial Secretaries and jrider Secretaries  Secretaries to the Treasury and the Secretary of thewLf state.                   Department of Overseas Trade should continue to                   receive  2000 per annum, and. that the salary of the                   Secretary for the Mines Department should he raised                   to the sane figure.                        As regards the remaining Parliamentary Secretaries,                   we rec.pinr.recommend. that where the fixed salary of the Minister                   is  5000 per annum,  the salary of the Parliamentary                   Secretary should. De  1,500 per annum.   In cases,                   however,  where the fixed salary of the Minister is                    3000,? the salary of his Parliamentary Secretary                   should, remain at  1,200.                   (7)  In the case of the Admiralty the salary of the                   Parliamentary and Financial Secretary is  2,000                   and that of the Civil Lord  1,000 (aggregating  5,000                   in all) while in the case of the War Office the                   Under Secretary of State and the Financial Secretary                   each receive a salary of  1,500.   We suggest that                   while no  change should De made at the moment,  the                   question  whether the Admiralty and the War Office should                   (like the Air Ministry)  have a single Under                   Secretary,  might De  noted for consideration on the                   occasion of the formation of the next Administration.                         &quot;(B&quot;)  Salar--&quot;- of the Leader of the...Opposition.              10.     We recommend that there should De a salary              of  2,000 per annum payable as of right to the person              elected to be Leader of the official Opposition.
 In many  cases he will he an  ex Cabinet Minister, but  sometimes  (as  at present) he will  not have held Cabinet Office.  Should he have been awarded any  pension as  an  ex Minister, that pension should  merge in his official salary as Leader of  the Opposition.      (O) Pensions  for..ex Ministers.lie   We  attach  (Annex II)  a  note on the present position in regard to Ministerial Pensions,  from which it will be seen that under the Political Offices  Pension Act, 1369, a limited nuiiber  of political pensions might be  granted and paid subject to the conditions  and qualifications laid down in  the Ac to   No political pension is now in existence.   The last  pa.yi.ent of a  pension (granted many years before) under the Act was  in 1924. !2o   In  certain respects the Act of 1869 is  out of date, and we have examined proposals which might be thoughtmore  suitable to present circumstances.  The more important of these proposals will be &quot;Pound in Annex III to this Report.  /It would  be possible,if  such a course was thought expedient, to  weave into a scheme of the kind  outlined in Annex III proposals, which  have met with  some support, for -o ens ions for Members  ofParliament. 13.   Our examination of the scheme in Annex III showed, that it was open to very serious politicaladministrative  and other objections;,
14.   For&apos; example, it was pointed out that the Act of1869 and previous legislation on the subject of MinisterialPensions had laid down limits on the number of Ministerial&apos;Pensions which might be awarded.   In the Act of 1617 thismaximum was 22.   In the Act of 1834 it was 16, and in theAct of 1869 it was 12.   The reason for limitation was notthe cost, which in any case would be Insignificant, butthe avoidance of public scandal and criticism which alavish grant of pensions to ex Ministers might excite.It was urged against limitation that the limit might beput either high or low.   If it v/ere high, it wouldprobably be inoperative.   If it were low, it might haveinequitable and embarrassing consequences.   For example,there might be only one pension left to be awarded andtwo or more qualified applicants with equally strongclaims and qualifications.   Another argument against  .&quot;a limitation of numbers was the possibility that an administration of one political complexion might remainin Office over a long period of years, awarding pensionsup to the maximum number, and leaving none for their opponents.    Account should also be taken in this connec-tion of the tendency for Cabinets to increase in size.15.   Ultimately we agreed that if the age qualification for the award of a pension was raised from 50 to 65, thiswould constitute a more effective safeguard than a limit of numbers, and. would render unnecessary the inclusionof any such limit in the scheme.16.   Much greater difficulties arise on the thirdcondition - the Means Test or Meeds Test.   It was pointedout that such a test might be either (a) the inadequacy of the ex Minister&apos;s private fortune&apos;to maintain the               .      -9-        - :&apos;
fstation  in. life to which lie had been accustomed;  or (b) the inadequacy of his resources to keep him from seriousprivation.   Difficulty arose from the very differentstandards which men could afford, or to which they wereaccustomed before they became Ministers., and the fact thatin  some  cases those standards had risen on the attainment of  Cabinet rank.   Even after most careful examination bythe impartial ana confidential committee, referred to in annex III, the results might be such as to create publicscandal  or acute Parliamentary criticism.   Dor example,if  account was taken, of the private fortune of two Ln&amp;i-viduals  who had held the same or similar Offices, one ofthem, commonly accounted poor, might be awarded a pension of  500  a year, while the other, commonly accounted rich,might be awarded a pension of  2,000 a year.   This wouldbe most  difficult, if not impossible, to defend.17.   In view of difficulties  such as these, it hasbeen suggested that condition (3) should be altogetheromitted  from the scheme, and that an ex Minister whosatisfied conditions (l) and (2) should be entitled, as of  right, to a pension on the analogy of pensionable crown servants.   It has, however, been impressed upon us that from this point of view there is no real analogy betweenthe service of Ministers and Members of Parliament andthe service of members of the Fighting Services and ofthe Civil Service.   Persons enter the Crown Services atan  early age with a view to making a long and continuouscareer for themselves in a particular Service.    In so doing they preclude themselves by the terms of their employment from engaging in any other occupation than theservice  of the State.   One of their conditions of employ-meat is  that when their service terminates they become                    -10-
eligible for a pension, the amount of which &apos;is basedinter.....alia on the length and continuity of service.The position in regard to Ministers and Members ofParliament is entirely different.    Their service is notcontinuous, and it is open to them (when not in Office)to engage in trade and industry or to follow their pro-fession.   Indeed, the fact that an individual has heldhigh Office is not infrequently a passport to lucrativeoutside employment.18.   Having regard to the Government&apos;s settled policyin respect of the Means Test under the unemployment assistance scheme, it would not be easy to defend aproposal that Ministers&apos; pensions should be awardedwithout reference to any such test.19*   In view of the many grave doubts and difficultieswhich have arisen in the course of our examination ofa scheme for Ministerial Pensions, we have reached thecon.clu.sion that it would be very difficult indeed, to getany scheme through the House of Commons.  In thisconnection we have not overlooked the highly congestedstate of the Parliamentary programme and the difficulties with which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasuryis confronted.   On these grounds we recommend that no general scheme for pensions for ex Ministers should beincluded in the proposed legislation.                    *2flo   We are, however, agreed that the Bill shouldmake provision for the grant to ex Prime Ministers ofa pension  of 52,000 a year, without any conditions.                  -11 -
a/.22..   Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations..            C        Ministers&apos;___Salaries.           (1)  The  proposed legislation should cover  all               Ministerial  salaries  other  than those  of               the  Lord Chancellor,  the Attorney-General,               the  Solicitor-General,-,  the  Lord Advocate,               and  the  Solicitor-General for  Scotland.               If the  inclusion in the Bill - of a  complete               list of  salaries for  Ministers of  the  status               of Under Secretary would he likely to  prolong               discussion and provoke  many amendments, the               schedule, so far as Under Secretaries  are               concerned, might he limited to those whose               salaries would he altered under the scale               now  proposed.           (2)  The  salary received by  all  Cabinet Ministers               (except  the  Prime Minister) to be   5,000 a               year.  If the  Minister  by virtue of his               Office is not  receiving the full figure,               e.g.  as  Minister of Transport,  his salary               to be made up  to  5,000 as  long as he  is in               the  Cabinet.           (3)  The  salary of  the Prime Minister to be                10,000  a year.           (4)  In the event  of a Chancellor  of the Duchy               of Lancaster becoming a Member of  the               Cabinet  the  additional  amount  required, to               raise his remuneration  of  5,000 per annum               to be met from Public Funds.(5)  The alterations in certain Ministerial    salaries specified in paragraph 9 (5)  and    (6) should be approved.    Note.   The question whether the fixed           salary of the Chancellor of the           Duchy of Lancaster should be           increased to  3,000 per annum is           a matter for consideration by the           Council of the Duchy as it is borne           on Duchy revenues.(6)  On the occasion of the formation of the    next Administration the question should be    considered whether the admiralty and the    War Office need hrve more than a single    Under Secretary.Salary of the Leader of the Opposition.     (7) There should be a salary of  2,000         per annum payable as aright to the         person elected to be Leader of the         official Opposition.  Should this person         be awarded any pension as an ex-Minister,         that pension should merge.in his official         salary as Leader of the Opposition.
         Pensions for Ex-Ministers.              (8) While no general scheme of pensions                  for ex&quot;Ministers should be included                  in the proposed legislation, the Bill                  should make provision for the grant to                  ex-Prime Ministers of a pension of  2,000                  per annum without,  any conditions.              -Note.   Our conclusions on the question of the                     limit on the number of Secretaries of                     State and Under Secretaries of State who                     may sit in the  House of Commons are                     contained in our further Report &apos;                     (CP. 29 (37) ) .2%.     If the Cabinet approve our conclusions and recommend-ations.  we suggest that we should be authorised to arrange forthe preparation of a draft Bill for  the consideration in due course of the Home Affairs Committee and the Cabinet.Signed on behalf of the Committee           JOHN SIMON            Chairman.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.January 22nd., 1937.

                 ANNEX II.        PENS IONS.. FOR EX-MINISTERS.                       93            PRESENT  POSITION.       There  is  no political pension  in  existence  at the present time hut the  Political  Offices  (pension)  Act, 1869, contains provisions under which a  limited number  of political pensions might he granted  ana paid.   The Act  aiviues  political  officers  into  three classes, viz;-       Olass  1 - with  salary of  not less than  5,000                per annum, incluumg however the  First                Lore of the Admiralty,  who at present                receives  4,500 with an official  residence.       Class  2 - with salary of  less  than  5,000 and not                less than  2,000 per annum,       Class  3 - with salary of  less  than  2,000 and more                than  1,000.       The scales of and qualifying service for pension laid own by the Act are as follows:-                       Scale of       Qualifying Service                       p&quot; en si on.c                   Not exceeding        Not less  than                           1st class pension      2,000           4 years,  or its                                      equivalent, in a 1st                                      class office. 2nd    &quot;      &quot;         1,200           6 years,  or its                                      equivalent, in a                                      2nd class office. 3rd    &quot;      &quot;          S00           10 years  in a 3rd                                      class office.      Service in a  3rd or 2nd class office counts as service for half that time in a 2nd or 1st class  officerespectively, but there must  be a .,iinimum service of  2years in a 1st class office  for a 1st class pension andof 3 years in a 2nd class office for a 2nd class  pension. Service need not be continuous.      Not x-aore than four pensions of a given class maybe paid concurrently,  nor may more than one  jension (ofany class) be granted in the  sane year^
      No office created after the Act of 1869 is to rankas a political office for the purposes of the Act unlessthe office is created by Act of Parliament,  nor is any increase in salary in an existing office,  made otherwise than under the authority of an Act,  to entitle the officeto rank in a higher class.      The Statute providesbe abated oy the amount ofdrawn from public funds orof the Dominions.that a political pension is tofrom the revenues of any /artany salary or remuneration      These political pensions are payable out.of the consolidated Puna.   Payment is made by the paymaster general on certificates of life.   There is no provisionfor special notification to Parliament ana in thesecircumstances the Finance Accounts have always shown thename of the recipient and the amount paid.      The Act of 1869 incorporated Section 6 of 4 and 5Will IV c.24 which aeals ,vith the declaration to be madepersons claiming pensions ana is&apos; as follows:      VIo  And whereas the Principle of the      Regulations for granting Allowances of      this Nature is and ought to be founded      on a Consideration, not only of the      Services performed by the Individual to      the State, but of the Inadequacy of his      private Fortune to maintain iris Station      in Life;  be it therefore enacted That      from and after the passing of this Act,      whenever any Person shall seek to obtain      any One of the Pensions before mentioned,      his Application for that purpose shall be      made in Writing to the Commissioners of      His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, to which he shall      subscribe his Name,  ana which shall contain,      not only a Statement of the Services per-      foiaied oy him,  and the Grounds on which      such Pension is claimed,  but a specific      Declaration that the Amount of his Income      from other Sources is so - limited as to taring      him within, the Intent and meaning of this-      Act and the Principle herein-above declared,      ana without-such Declaration no pension as      herein-taefore provided or authorised shall      be grantedi
      The normal procedure appears to have oeen for the applicant to make his application to the First Lore who placed on recora that he was satisfied that the applicant1s circumstances were such as to bring him within the intention of the above section.   It has not been the practice to require subsequent declarations of means after a pension is awarded:  but it has been the practice to require pensioners to undertake to surrender their pensions in the event of any material - improvement of circumstances.      In terms the section speaks of the &quot;inadequacy of his private fortune&quot; and the &quot;amount of his income from other sources&quot;.   This Act was,  of course,  passed before the married 7vomen&apos;s Property Acts.    In practice,  it would presumably be expected that an applicant would haveregard to his wife1s fortune as well as his own.    Althoughthe pension for each class is prescribed by the Actas a maximum it appears that, in practice,  all pensionsgranted have been at the maximum figure.
      The scheme alight &quot;be that a pension,  say of  2,000a year as a maximum, might be granted to an ex-cabinet minister who fulfillea the three following conditions -   (1) He must have served fox lour years  as a Cabinet   Minister, or for a corresponding period made up by   combining his time as Cabinet Minister  with his time   as a Minister of the second or third class, counting   two years in the second class or four years in the   third class as equivalent to one year as Cabinet   Minister.   (2) He must have attained a certain age, say 60.   (3) He must satisfy some form of confidential   Committee as to his existing resources  and as to the   extent of his needs, so that he may receive what is   appropriate, not exceeding the xuaximum.      The best.machinery for hearing his application andoeteruiining what is th; proper grant is very difficultto devise.   Presumably, the granting authority would bethe Lords of the Treasury, out they would first have beforethem the report of the confidential Committee, say threepersons of hi^h confidence and experience  such as ex-Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury or the like.  Theapplicant would have to make full disclosure of his meansand prospects (and also of the financial position of his wife), when his case was considered oy the Committee, andit would be necessary to secure, in one way or another,that changes in his financial position after the pension
was first granted woula be Drought to the notice of theCommittee with a view to modifying the arrangement.Ex-Ministers who have never reached the Cabinet but have served for- a long time in subordinate Ministerial officesmight be brought within the scheme for a lower maximumpensiono
