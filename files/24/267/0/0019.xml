THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.MOST SECRET.Copy No.CP. 18 (37).TO BE  KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this  document.CABINET.PLAN FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OF  FIRST  LINE STRENGTH OF                       THE ROYAL AIR  FORCE.    AS  my  colleagues are aware,  the  Air Ministry  have been  giving  closeconsideration to the possibility of creating a more effective Striking  Force by the summer of 1939.    The forecast of German intentions  which was  contained in C.I.D. Paper1265-B, confirmed as it is by the latest estimates of German productive capacity(C.I.D. Paper 1284-B), clearly make this imperative; apart altogether from theGovernments pledges  as regards parity.    While I think it  would be unreasonable to regard our parity pledges ascompelling us to equip our Metropolitan  Force with  a number of aircraft equalto that of the German Air Force irrespective of circumstances (e.g., to ignore thefact that a great German army requires more Army Co-operation aircraft, orto take no account of our own  Fleet- Air Arm  strength  as against  german aircraft  intended for  Fleet co-operation), we must,  I suggest, at least aim athaving     (a)  A striking bomber force not inferior to that of Germany.    (b)  A fighter force of a strength requisite to meet  the probable  scale of           attack.    The effective strength of a bomber force, of course, depends not merely onnumbers, but also on range, performance and load.  But  unless we can guaranteesuperiority in these respects, which we cannot, we must, I suggest,  aim at an equal number of first line  bomber aircraft, with adequate reserves.    The Air Staff estimate that  the German first line  strength by April  1939will comprise 2,500 aircraft, of  which 1,700 will be bombers.    Our own programme  for 1939 (with a total Metropolitan strength of 1,750aircraft)  provides for 70 squadrons  of Bombers comprising  1,022 first line aircraft.   Our programme also  includes  provision for  reserves  of  aircraftamounting roughly to 225  per cent, of first line strength, and, moreover, providesfor  the additional formation of  12 squadrons for overseas.    It would be impossible without a complete dislocation of industry to  increase this programme by 1939;  and in  any case it is likely that.the full execution ofthe  present programme of  production will be some months late.    In my view,  however, it is vital to  create a larger deterrent force by theearliest  possible date.  We have cast about for  ways  to achieve this; and I now propose  the  plan which  is dealt with  in  detail in the  appended Air  staff memorandum.Memorandum  by  the Secretary of State for Air.
    The plan provides  for an increase of our  Striking Force up to a first line strength of 1,700 aircraft as soon as possible.  As this cannot be carried out by1939 as an addition to our present programme, an interim plan has been devised.The essence of this temporary plan is that  we should temporarily draw  on our reserves to create a much larger first line strength.   It involves also the retentionat home of 10 of the 12 new Overseas squadrons, and their reprovision for overseasas soon as possible after March  1939.   In order to achieve this result,  we shallhave to some extent to introduce personnel from the Reserve into first line unitsimmediately on mobilisation.  I consider that  this is a proper risk to take,  inorder to create the increased deterrent of a larger first line Striking Force by1939.   -    If this plan  is approved, the Metropolitan first  line strength of the RoyalAir Force by April 1939, as compared with the existing programme, would be asfollows :                       -Comparative.

Any expansion beyond that figure would create a new situation.    The plan provides for the re-creation by 1941 of Reserve of equipment and of personnel on the scale authorised in the 1939 Programme, and for the formationof squadrons to take the place of the Overseas squadrons temporarily  retained atHome.  It. also involves  the creation of a number of new operational  stations,some increase in  the number of stores depots, the maintenance at full  strengthof all training stations  and facilities, and some additions to technical training establishments to cover  the increased requirements  of  the greater first line strength.    The Air Ministry have made as near a general estimate as they can of the costof these requirements, and this is set out in the  financial note which  follows theAir Staff Memorandum.        ,                                                          (Signed)       S.    January 14,  1937.                          Air Staff Memorandum.    1.  The latest  information  as  to German air developments indicates  thatthe German Government now aim at producing a first line strength of not lessthan 2,500 aircraft by April 1939,  of which about 1,700 will be bombers.  Theestimate as to  the  output of  the&apos; German  aircraft industry which was latelycirculated to the  Committee of Imperial Defence  (Memorandum 1284-B) showsthat this programme will be within  their capacity for the production of aircraft and engines; and there can be  no doubt  as  to the availability  of  sufficientpersonnel.    2.  The programme of expansion for the Royal Air Force to which the AirMinistry have been working since the question was last reviewed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in February  1936   will  provide  a  total Metropolitan  first  line strength of 1,736 by April 1939-of which 1,022 will be bomber aircraft.    3.  Effective capacity for air aggression being mainly  measured by strength in bomber aircraft,  the Air Staff have considered what measures are practicable
to provide a more satisfactory comparative position by April 1939. It is necessary on industrial grounds to dismiss any plan which would be based on the produc-tion of a larger number of aircraft by April 1939 than what has been or will be ordered to  carry  out the present approved programme.  That being so, any increases  in first line strength by that date can  only be secured  by temporarydrawings upon the  reserve stocks  for squadrons included  in  the existing programme.  It will,  in short, be possible to put a larger force into the air at theoutbreak of war, but  our capacity for sustained operations will be very seriouslyreduced.  The  expedient  of increasing our immediate fighting capacity by drawing upon  the reserves of aircraft and personnel  is, therefore, clearly onewhich could only be  adopted as  a temporary measure; and  if it is employed  itwill be of the first importance to reprovida a proper basis  of  those reserves as early as possible.     4.  On this assumption the  following measures are recommended :       (a) The formation  by  April 1939  of  an additional  11  medium  bomber           squadrons each with a peace  strength of 18  first line  aircraft:           Increase in striking  force 198 aircraft.     (&amp;) The increase in the establishment of 7 of the older established  Auxiliary           Air Force squadrons from 12 to 21 aircraft:  Increase in striking force            63 aircraft.     (c) The conversion of 4 other Auxiliary Squadrons from Bombers to Fighters,           in order to provide improved defence for Northern Areas, which, with           the increased range of newer types of aircraft, will  be  in the zone of           possible attack : Decrease in striking force 48 aircraft.     (d) An increase  of the first line strength of 28 heavy and medium bomber           squadrons from 12 to 14 aircraft each :  Increase in striking force            56 aircraft.     (e) An increase of the first line strength of the  2 Torpedo Bomber  squadrons           from 16 to 21 aircraft: Increase in striking force 10 aircraft.Total increase of striking force provided by (a), (&amp;),  (c), (d) and  (e)^ 279 aircraft.     5.  It  will also be  possible  to  strengthen  the  Metropolitan  position bytemporarily retaining at home some  or all of the 12 squadrons due to form for overseas by April  1939.   One of these squadrons is already forming in  kenya and it is important that some sign should be given by 1939 that we are determined to maintain our position  at Hong Kong where one squadron of the 4 which. have been approved should go as  early as practicable.  But it is for consideration that the other 10 should be retained  at home and  reprovided  for going abroad in the following years 1939-41.   Incidentally, this would save a good deal ofexpenditure which would  otherwise be necessary for temporary accommodationabroad if we adhered to the original plan of sending  them overseas by April 1939 :and in the event of the more probable  area of disturbance shifting from europe to the Middle or Far East, it will be possible to review the situation again.  Byretaining 10 squadrons in England and by raising  their first line establishmentfrom 12  to 18  aircraft we should gain an increase  in the striking force  of180  aircraft.     6.  With  these  additions, the peace strength  of the striking force will beincreased from 1,022  to 1,481 first line aircraft.  To  do this will put a great strain on  that  portion  of  our personnel which  at that date  will  possess  sufficientexperience to carry out duties of  leadership and supervision.   There will, in fact,at first be a serious shortage of officers of air experience appropriate to the dutiesof Flight Commanders.   The position in  this respect will,  however,  rapidly improve as time goes on.     7.   It would  be  possible to increase our first line strength on  mobilisation which would make available the  whole resources of  the Royal Air Force Reserve, and would release a considerable  number of serving officers from peace-time duties. It is proposed therefore to make plans for increasing the first line establishment of 50 bomber squadrons from 18 to 21 aircraft each.  The additional 3 aircraft would be held in the squadrons  in time of peace and their pilots and crews sent to them on mobilisation.  This  would produce another  150  first line aircraft.     8.  The cumulative effect of all the above measures would be to produce by April 1939 a Metropolitan strength on mobilisation of 1,631 bomber aircraft,  as       [14447]                  &quot;                                    B 2
compared with 1,022 under the present approved  scheme.   This would not benumerically equal  to the.estimated German bomber force of 1,700 aircraft,  buttaking all factors  into account it should provide an adequate deterrent againstthe risk  of air attack by Germany in 1939.   A material factor is that at thatdate, in respect of experienced personnel, Germany would be in a  position inferiorto ourselves.    9.  These measures would only be a temporary  expedient to  meet a transientsituation and it would be necessary at once to initiate measures  which would, assoon as possible after 1939, re-establish the standing strength and organisationof the Metropolitan Air Force on a proper basis.  This will involve the provisionof additional first  line aircraft to  bridge the gap between the standing strengthof the German bombing force and our own, and five squadrons are provided forthat purpose.  Measures will also be needed  for  the  provision of  reserves of aircraft  and personnel  to the scale previously  contemplated and  of theirprovision for the larger number of first line aircraft.  It would also be necessaryto reprovide  for overseas the 10 squadrons retained at home.    10.  The proposals in the present Memorandum are framed on the  assump-tion that the recreation of a proper  scale of reserves of aircraft and the reprovisionof the squadrons for overseas should be completed within two years after 1938-39,i.e., by the end of 1940-41.    11.  To  do this, early approval of  the principle of the scheme is necessary if the requisite additional personnel  is  to be  entered, and trained in time, andthe necessary accommodation for  them provided.  As  regards  accommodation,it will be necessary to acquire sites for 13 new operational stations to house the 26extra squadrons which would be provided under the scheme.  It will be necessary toestablish a new School for the technical training of the largely increased numbersof apprentices; and to make increases in various  ground  and flying  training establishments and in storage units.  The exact form and extent of these increasescannot yet be stated, but allowance is made for them in the financial statementattached to this Memorandum.    12.  The Air  Ministry estimate that  to  implement the above proposals itwill be necessary to enter the following additional personnel in the four years1937-38, 1938-39,  1939-40 and 1940-41.  The figure (1) under  each  year showsrequirements as estimated for the present approved scheme of expansion.  Thefigure (2) under each year shows the total numbers which should be entered to implement the present scheme :-Year. .	Short Service Officers.		Airman Pilots.		Apprentices.		Boys.		Other	Airmen.

It will further be necessary to increase the reserve of pilots and to that end  to enlarge the training  centres which are being created  under the RoyalAir Force Volunteer Reserve Scheme and also materially to increase their numberabove the 33 already contemplated.  Approval is desired to  the increase  of theyearly entry into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve for training  as pilotsto the following  figures, as compared with the present approved entry of 800per annum :            1937-38.       1938-39.        1939-40.       1940-41.            1,200           2,000           2,000           2,000     Air Ministry, January 14, 1937:
FINANCIAL NOTE ON  THE ABOVE PLAN.     The net total of Air Votes over the 4 financial years 1937-1940 under thepresent  expansion  programme  has  hitherto  been   roughly   estimated  at 350,000,000.  This figure took account of the normal and  necessary policy of replacing aircraft, but made no allowance for the effect of including in thisreplacement the latest types which would become available in or about 1939.     It is now  clear that, apart from any further expansion, this replacementwould have to include the most modern  aircraft, and this factor must, therefore,be taken into account.   On this basis, the estimated total  over  the period inquestion would be of the order of  375,000,000.     On a comparable basis the estimate for the scheme now  put forward would amount to  425,000,000, a difference of  50,000,000 over the 4  years. In addition,there would  be an increased  carry-forward on works and buildings,  resultingfrom this scheme, of approximately  8,000,000 into 1941 and  1942.     Recurrent  expenditure after the 31st March, 1941, would necessarily be at ahigher level under the new scheme than  under the old, and might be of the  orderof  15,000,000 a year, but the actual excess would depend upon decisions of policytaken from time  to time in  regard to various matters,  such as the rate  of re-equipment by new types of aircraft.     It must be pointed out that the  above figures are all necessarily speculative,and represent the order of magnitude of  anticipated expenditure.     No provision has been made in these estimates for an additional bomb reserve,and  it has been assumed that the bomb reserve already provided for  would be located in remote areas in unprotected and untraversed stores.  The estimate for works and buildings has been based on the assumption that they will be  of apermanent character.
