DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                      CABINET       DEAF CHILDREN (SCHOOL ATTENDANCE) BILL                    Memorandum &quot;by         President of the Board of Education.     1*   On Friday, January 29th, the second Bill on theOrder Paper is a Bill introduced by Mr.Rostron Duckworth(Moss Side) for reducing the age of compulsory attendance at school by deaf children from 7 to 5.   I desire theinstructions^pf my colleagues as to the attitude I should adopt towards this-Bill.     2.   The deaf are the&quot;bde exception to.Jkhe general lawthat compulsory attendance begins at 5 years of age.Whatever may have been the grounds for this exception whenit was established over forty years ago, none exists today and, in fact, the majority of deaf children of 5 - 7 yearsof age attend school voluntarily.     3.   An amendment of the lav/ to bring deaf children inthis respect into line with all other children was urged uponthe Board as long ago as July 1933.   On that occasion the then Parliamentary Secretary stated to a deputation that,while he was unable to pledge the President of the Board orthe Cabinet, if an opportunity arose of inserting a clauserelatiiig to this matter in an Education Bill, it would havehis sympathy.   The insertion of a clause in the education bill last year proved not to be practicable, but in theHouse last summer I expressed my readiness to consider theintroduction of legislation if I was assured that such legislation would be entirely uncontroversial and would haveSSGRET .CP. 9 (37).Copy No.
the full support of the Local Education Authorities andthe organised bodies concerned..    Information has sincereached me which shows that not only the organised bodies concerned with the interests Of the deaf, but also the associations of Local Education Authorities, the LondonCounty Council and the National Union of Teachers allsupport the change.   The Bill is backed by Mr.Cove (Labour)and Mr.Leckie (National Liberal) as well as by sixUnionist members, and I have every reason to anticipate that it will prove entirely uncontroversial.     4.   The cost to the Exchequer of the change shouldnot exceed  5,000 a year.     5.   The Bill is a very short one,  the substantiveclause being only three lines long.  It is  in suitable form and could be passed without amendment.   It does not require a financial resolution.     6.   The first Bill on the paper is contentious, andmay not be disposed of in time to leave even the few minutes necessary for the second reading of Mr.Duckworth&apos;bill.     7.   If my colleagues agree, I should propose -     (a)  If the Bill comes on,  to express my sympathy              with it.     (b)  If the 3ill does not come on,  to adopt the Bill              as a Government measure.     8.   The Treasury have been consulted and have noobservati ons.January, 1937.O.F.G.S.
