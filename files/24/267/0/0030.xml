(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT :S E C R E ToCOPY NO. $7)CoP.  29(57),CABINET.COMMITTEE ON MINISTERSSALAR IESECOND REPORT.1.&apos;ur main Report (CoP. 20 (37)) was concerned withthe questions of Ministerial Salaries; the Salary cfthe Leader of the official Sppositisn, and Pensions for ministers.   There remains the question of the limit onthe number of Secretaries of State and Under secretaries of State sitting in the House of Commons.2.     The present law is that not more than sixSecretaries of State or more than six Under Secretaries ifState are capable of sitting and voting in the House ofCommons (Section 3 of the Secretaries of State Act, 1926 )0While therefore,  at present, the law does not require thatany Secretaries of State or Under Secretaries of state should sit in the House of Lords, its effect is to securethat two Secretaries of State and two Under secretaries of State sit in that House.30     The requirements in this respect of the existinglav/ involve a distinction &quot;between Secretaries of Stateand other Cabinet Ministers and, as Cabinet Ministers arenow on an equality, are now obsolete.   It has beensuggested to us that provision might he made in the new legislation to ensure that the minimum Governmentrepresentation in the House of Lords should consist ofthe Lord Chancellor and two other Cabinet Ministers,- 1 -
              together-with, two Under Secretaries of State or              Parliamentary Secretaries.!                         r              4o      The Lord Privy Seal  is doubtful as to the              desirability of providing for any minimum Cabinet              representation in the House of Lords.    He has pointed              out that at the present time that representation  is              five and not three and he is apprehensive that under              the suggested provision the minimum would tend to becoi-              the normals   Moreover, he  fears that  some future              administration might endeavour, by reducing the              quality of their Ministerial representation in the              House of Lords, to diminish its position and prestige              5.       The other members of the Committee invited the              Lord Privy Seal and the Home Secretary to meet to              work cut a scheme, and they put forward the following              suggestion -                   (l)  The existing&quot; provision as to a maximum  of                           six Secretaries of State  in the Commons                           to remain in effect unaltered.                   (S)  As regards Under  Secretaries of State,  no                           limitation in  the Commons,  provided  that                           two Under Secretaries (whether Under                           Secretaries of State or Parliamentary                           Secretaries) shall be in  the LordSo                                  Sigxied  on behalf of the Committee                                            JOHN SIMON                                              Chairman.Whitehall Gardens, SJ/ol..h January, 19570- 2 -
