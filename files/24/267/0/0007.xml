SECRET.Copy No^cp. 6pf (57)                     CAB  I If E T,                         SPAIN.Memorandum  by  the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     The  Spanish conflict  has now entered upon a phase which calls for the urgent attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  In a laterpart of this paper I will  set out the steps which I propose fordealing with this  situation, and which I hope my colleagues willapprove.  But it is necessarjf, in order that this problem may bevisualised  in its  true perspective that we should view it in itsbroadest  international aspect as well as in its immediate detail.The Spanish civil  war has  ceased to be an internal Spanish issue and has become an  international battle-ground.  The character of thefuture Government  of Spain has now become less important to thepeace of Europe than that  the dictators should not be victorious inthat country.  The extent  and character of the intervention nowpractised by Germany and Italy have made it clear to the world thatthe object  of these Powers is to secure General Franco&apos;s victorywhether or  not it  represents the will of the Spanish people.   More-over, since the Anglo-French appeal was issued on Christmas Eve, some15,000 &apos;&apos;volunteers&quot; have been sent from Italy, while we  have  infor-mation, as  yet unconfirmed, of further German contingents.
      2.   It  is  true  that volunteers have  also  crossed the frontier  from France  into  Spain  in considerable numbers-  These are,  however, in a somewhat different  category.  They are  not organised, they have  no military experience and they are for the most  part neither armed nor equipped.  Indeed, confidential information given me  by the French Ambassador  shows that the fate  of these people  is often an unhappy  one.  They are  shep- . herded into hastily organised formations  and flung into  the line, where many of them are killed.  An additional problem has  been created by the  fact that some of these volunteers are proceeding from  this country and that their number is increasing.  The Attorney General has  informed us that in his judgment this is contrary to the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act.  The Foreign Office has received some appeals from parents of volun- teers to stop this practice and it is clear that some definition of the legal position cannot be long delayed.   The official attitude of the Soviet Government is dealt with later in this paper.  We have also  reliable information which goes to show that the Comintern have issued instructions to their agents in other countries to cease recruiting volunteers. 5.   The position of Italy is difficult to estimate.   Tf we are to judge from Count Ciano&apos;s interviews with Sir Eric Drummond, the Italian Government does not wish to proceed to extreme lengths in Spain,  and would be willing to accept  a practical solution of the problem of volunteers.   It is  even possible that italy is becoming uneasy at the extent of German  activity in Spain and more particularly in Morocco.  At the same  time it isuseless to disguise the fact that the  announcement of the arrival of Italian volunteers in Spain almost  simultaneously  with                                                         the...
 the  exchange  of our assurances with that country,  - and^the latest information shows that 4,000 more volunteers have  arrived, whose  landing has not yet been made public,  - has  much damaged the  good effect of the Anglo-Italian declarations  in British public opinion.   If that impression is  to be countered it is essential&apos;that we should be  in a position to make  to the  Italian Government  a.  proposal in connexion  with the  problem of volunteers which  that  Government should be in  a position to accept.   Despite appearances,  I believe that  our agreement with Italy may  be productive  of results.   It is important,  therefore,  that  the pro- posals which  we  now make  should be  such as both Italy can accept herself and put  pressure  upon Germany to  accept also.     4.   It is above all  important  to visualise this Spanish problem in  relation to Germany, and we  have  received many indi- cations that  the  more  cautious  influences in Germany are  opposed to this Spanish  adventure.   Of  these  influences the  Army  and the Foreign Office  are  the most  important.   It was these  same  in- fluences  that  opposed the German reoccupation of the  Rhineland last March.   They were  over-ruled,  and  since  that  coup Was  success- fully  realised by Germany, their over-ruling was held  in  German eyes to have been well  justified.    If on  this occasion again no attempt  is  made  to  check this further German adventure, then wemay be  certain that when on  a  subsequent  occasion  the Nazi partyurges  extreme  courses  the more  cautious influences will have no  ----- opportunity to make  themselves  felt.  The Spanish  conflict apart,Memel,  Danzig  and Czechoslovakia are Europe&apos;s present danger point:                                                          I - *****
At..____If German interference is not checked in Spain, there will be no chance of moderating influences in that country checking any similar aggressive tendencies in respect of any of these threedanger points.  It is therefore my conviction that unless we crya halt in Spain, we shall have trouble this year in one or other of the danger points I have referred to.  It follows that to befirm in Spain is to gain time, and to gain time is what we want.We cannot in this instance gain time by marking it.  It is to beremembered that in the language of the Nazi.party any adventureis a minor adventure.  They spoke thus of the Rhine-land last year,they are speaking thus of Spain today, they&apos;will speak thus ofMemel, Danzig or Czechoslovakia tomorrow.   It is only by showingthem that these dangerous distinctions are false that we can hope to avert a greater calamity.  5.  In these conditions I consider it imperative that we shouldspare no effort to put a stop to intervention in Spain, and withthis  object in view,  I submit the following proposals which I desireshould be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for joint international action to prevent the further aggravation of the Spanish civil war.
  6.   At  a meeting of the Non-intervention  Committee held on December 22nd Lord Plymouth drew attention  to  the  increasing number of foreigners entering Spain  for  the  purpose of taking part in  the civil war and proposed  that  each Government should be asked  itself to  take  the  action necessary to put a stop to these movements and to  agree to  January 4th as the date as from which this prohibition should be enforced.   The  action of the Soviet representative in refusing to  agree to any such  prohibition until a system of  control had been put  into force led  to the appointment of a sub-committee to  examine the matter in further detail and it became clear that no further  progress  could  be  made on the Committee.  7.  In  these circumstances  the attention  of the German,  Italian, Portuguese and Soviet Governments was drawn on December 24th tothis   situation and those  Governments were invited to take as soon as possible such  legislative or other appropriate action as mightbe necessary to prevent  the  flow of men to Spain and to say whetherthey would be ready to  do  so on a date early in January to be fixed by agreement.  Similar  action was taken at the same time by theFrench Government.  8. The French Government have already made it plain in a communi- cation to  the Committee  that they are prepared to take action ofthis kind  provided  other Governments do so.  9. Replies have now been received from all four Governments.  ThePortuguese Government take the line that,  while agreeing  inprinciple  to the  prohibition of volunteers, it  should not  be  con-sidered apart from other forms of intervention.   The  Soviet Govern-ment are ready to associate themselves with the Anglo-French  pro-posals provided that all countries  would agree  to  the  institutionas soon as possible of an effective control,  regardless of theattitude of the Insurgent generals, and would &quot;morally bind them-selves&quot; in the meantime to  check  the  flow  of  volunteers from  their                                                 territory
territory&quot;. 10.  The Italian Government have intimated to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Rome that they will be prepared immediately to stopany Italian volunteers from proceeding to Spain provided theFrench, Soviet and Belgian Governments do the same.  They are,however, in doubt as to whether any undertakings given by theother Governments could and would be carried out.  There is some ground for thinking that the Italian Government will also beready to give an assurance that they will immediately enforce theiiprohibition provided that the three Powers mentioned above givesimilar assurances. 11.  The German Government are ready to support all measuresdirected to preventing the flow of volunteers to Spain but ex-press the hope that  all possibilities of direct or indirect in-tervention shall be excluded once and for all.    They thereforemake their agreement dependent upon the conditions that        (a) the other participating governments decide to           . adopt the same attitude,        (b) the solution of the other questions connected with            indirect intervention shall be dealt with forthwith,            and        (c) all participating governments shall agree to a com-            pletely effective control of the prohibitions to be            agreed upon, such control to be carried out on the            spot..Should it not be possible to reach an agreement in regard to theprevention of other forms of indirect intervention, the GermanGovernment reserve the right to reconsider their attitude also inregard to the question of volunteers.    They consider that thebest  solution of the volunteer problem would be the removal from spain of all non-Spanish participants in the hostilities, including                                                    political
 political  agitators and propagandists.   They are  ready to  co- operate in such a scheme.   12.In addition to the proposals  which  have been made for check- ing the flow of volunteers  it  is necessary  to consider the present position regarding the  supply  of war material.  The Non-intervention Committee&apos;s scheme for  supervision has been submitted in detail to the two parties,  but  neither of them have yet  indicated whether they are prepared to  co-operate  in  this scheme.    The  omens are un- favourable,  and it must of  course  be remembered that this  scheme, even if accepted,  will  not  provide anything in the nature  of a guarantee  of effective  control.   15.   From the  general tenour of  the replies now received from the four Capitals it may  be gathered that, despite mutual suspicions of  good faith, the  four Governments  profess  for their respective parts to be  ready to undertake to  prohibit  the enlistment or recruitment  of volunteers for Spain  on condition that such pro- hibition is  general as  between the Powers concerned and that it is subject  to  an efficient and effective system of control.    14.   In  these circumstances and  in view of the urgent need of finding  an  immediate solution of this question which is pro-gressively tending  to become a menace to the peace of the world Iwould seek the sanction of the Cabinet to an initiative  to be takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government on the following lines:-        1.    In their desire to give proof of their sincere     determination to relax no effort to meet the  dangers  involved     in the present situation His Majesty&apos;s Government  will be  ready     to offer the services of His Majesty&apos;s Fleet  for the  purposes     of supervision by  sea of all approaches to Spanish  ports both     in Spain and in Spanish overseas possessions  with  a view to     -preventing the access to these territories either of  volunteers     from foreign countries or of war material which is  subject
cto prohibition under the agreement of the Non-intervention committee established in London.     This offer is made on the condition that     (a) each of the Governments parties to the non-intervention         agreement consents to the exercise over merchant         vessels flying its flag, by His Majestyrs Ships of the         necessary powers for this purpose, as indicated in         paragraph 5.     (b) to each of His Majesty&apos;s Ships employed in this task         there shall be attached a naval officer of one of         the countries whose Governments have agreed to par-         anticipate in the policy of non-intervention,     (c) His Majesty&apos;s Ships will be entitled to visit and if         necessary search merchant ships for the purpose of         preventing the importation of arms or volunteers into         Spain.    For this&quot;purpose they vail be entitled to         send ships into a convenient port for inspection if         for any reason the necessary investigation cannot be         completed at sea,     (d) Any ship which is found to be carrying arms or volun-         teers would be detained and handed over to the         authorities of her own country, who will be respon-         sible for dealing with her.     2.   They will at the same time and with the same object in view at once invite the French Government to associate them-selves with their efforts by closing the Franco-Spanishfrontiers forthwith to all foreign volunteers and war materialfalling within the prohibitions agreed upon by the Non-intervention Committee.    They will further suggest to theFrench Government the advisability of inviting the co-operation in their measures of frontier control of neutralofficers  to be selected from subjects of the countries represented on the Non-intervention Committee.     5.   They will urge the Portuguese Government to join with the other Powers in the above-indicated measures of pro-hibition, and either to establish the land control suggested to the French Government or    agree  that the naval control to be carried out by His Majesty&apos;s Ships shall  be  applied tovessels bound for Portuguese ports,  or preferably  both.
      4.   They will further call upon the French, Italian, German,   Portuguese and Soviet Governments&apos;to carry out at once the   undertaking which they.have given to stop the flow of volunteers   from their respective countries to Spain, on the understanding   that their lead will be immediately    followed by the other   participating countries,      5e   His Majesty&apos;s Government will issue a public statement   on the subject of the Foreign Enlistment Act and inform the   Governments concerned that henceforward it will be strictly   enforced.      60  To meet the desire expressed in some of the replies   received His Majesty&apos;s Government will undertake to urge all   the Powers represented in the Non-intervention Committee to   examine forthwith and find a speedy solution for all other forms   of indirect intervention in Spain.     15.   If my colleagues approve of this line of action,  I would at once make the above proposals to the Governments concerned,asking for immediate replies and explaining that these replieswould be communicated to  the Non-intervention Committee,  who  wouldthen be asked&apos;to fix a date on which the measures agreed uponshould be simultaneously&apos;put into operation.                                     A oE.                                         January 8th,  1957.
