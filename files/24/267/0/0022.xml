DRAINAGE OF TRADE PREMISES.               Memorandum by the Minister of Health.     1.   I desire the Authority of my colleagues for thepreparation and introduction of a Bill dealing with the reception of trade effluents into the sewers of local authorities.     2.   The existing law which dates from an Act of 1876 isobscure but broadly it may be said that traders have  no right ofdraining trade effluents into sewers, and where such drainage nowtakes place it is by arrangement with the local authority.   TheJoint Advisory Committee on River Pollution (appointed by theMinisters of Health and Agriculture and Fisheries)  in a Reportpublished in 1930, recommended legislation to give facilities totraders to drain trade effluents into sewers, subject to safeguards against the local authorities being made liable for unreasonablyheavy expenditure.   A Bill largely based on the Joint Committee&apos;srecommendations was introduced by Lord Gainford and passed by theHouse of lords last Session, but it reached the House of Commonstoo late in the Session for time to be given to it for a SecondReading,   This Bill was the result of negotiations with theinterests concerned (including the Federation of British Industries,the local authorities and the fishing interests, and the water transport authorities) , which had resulted in general agreement.The Bill now proposed is in substance, though not in form, the sameas Lord Gainford1s, and may be expected to command the same measureof general support.
SB     3.   Briefly, the proposals in the Bill would he on thefollowing lines:-          -(1)   Certain provisions of the Public Health Act,  1936;               which prohibit the draining of trade premises into               sewers would be repealed.          (2)   Local Authorities would.be empowered to make               byelaws, which would require the approval of the               Minister, for regulating the drainage of trade               effluents into their sewers, the more important               of the byelaw-making powers being to prescribe               (a) the intractable substances which must be               excluded from the trade effluent before discharge               into the sewers, (b)  the maximum quantity of trade.               effluent which may be drained from any trade               premises in any one day, and the maximum rate at               which it may be drained, without the consent of               the local authority or the Minister on appeal, and               (c) the charges to be paid by the trader for the               privilege of having trade effluent disposed of by               the local authority.          (3)   A  trader wishing to drain trade premises into the               sewers of a local authority would be required to               serve a notice giving details of his proposals and               to obtain the authority&apos;s consent to the drainage               of trade effluent into the sewers in excess of               limits prescribed by the byelaws.   Provision would               be made for an appeal to the Minister by any trader               aggrieved by a refusal of consent by the local               authority or by conditions imposed by them.          (4)   Provisions for the protection of Docks and Harbour               Authorities and other interested bodies would be               included.
     4.   The Bill should materially improve the condition ofrivers.   The chief concern of traders is with manufacture.Their control of trade effluents is to them a troublesomeincident, is likely to be ineffficiently exercised, and isextravagant as compared with collective action by the localauthority.     5.   It is very desirable that a Bill on these lines should become law in the present Session.   The need for action in theinterests of the purity of water - as well as of the amenity ofour streams and rivers - has been great, and legislation wouldcertainly have been undertaken long ago bu-o for the difficulty(which, as has been said, has now been overcome)  of reconciling the views of the powerful interests concerned.   In thecircumstances, the Bill should not be controversial and I should propose .that it should be introduced in the House of lords, acourse with which the Chief Whip agrees.                                          K.&apos; W.                                      January 20th, 1937.
