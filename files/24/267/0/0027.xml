THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.151SECEET.Copy  No.  41CP. 26 (37).CABINET.EXPOET  CREDITS  FOB  AFGHANISTAN.  Joint Memorandum,  by  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the                        Secretary of State for India.     THE following memorandum sets out the historical background of a requestmade by the Afghan Government to His  Majesty&apos;s Government for credits forthe purchase of British goods,  and the  reasons which, in our view, make itdesirable to give this request a favourable  answer.     2.  We are applying  to our colleagues for a decision on this subject because it has proved impossible to secure agreement between the Departments concerned and  because, while the sum of  money in  question is  comparatively small, thepolitical issues  involved in such a vital -nerve-centre for us as Afghanistan are of very great importance.  The matter is,  unfortunately, of some urgency, since theAfghan Prime Minister and the head of the Afghan National Bank are due to visit this country at the end of January and are almost certain to revert to thisquestion, which was raised by the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs in Londonlast February.     3.  It may be useful if we begin with  a brief general survey :      The present political situation in Afghanistan is remarkably stable.   It willbe remembered  that ex-King Amanullah was overthrown by revolution in  1929and  that a usurper then seized the  throne.  He was in turn defeated by NadirShah in the same year. Nadir Shah was  assassinated  in 1933, but his son, thepresent King, succeeded peacefully.  Most of the administration  is in the handsof the three surviving brothers  of Nadir Shah.  The Government are enlightened,but do not attempt to modernise  the country too quickly.  They are paying greatattention to the army  and greatly extending their authority over the hithertounruly tribes on the Afghan  side of the  North-West  Frontier  of  India.  TheGovernment are very friendly towards His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   The chiefdanger to the regime lies in the fact that it is a new dynasty and that practicallythe whole administration depends on three  individuals.    4.   Until  recently  Afghanistan&apos;s  economic  position  has  been  poor  andprimitive, with few exportable assets,  and consequently few means  to pay for imports from abroad.   The Government  of India  formerly paid the AfghanGovernment a yearly subsidy which enabled them to meet such foreign obligations.as they had.  The stoppage of  this subsidy in 1919, the extravagant expenditure&apos;of ex-King Amanullah, and the  civil wars of 1929-30  left the Afghan Govern-ment, at the beginning of  the present regime,  in  a  precarious financial andeconomic situation.    5.   The present rulers of the country  first improved their internal financial arrangements and then attempted to deal with the general economic situation by improving the balance of trade.  They hoped to achieve this in two ways first.,.9002  [14467]B
by developing to the full such natural resources as there are in Afghanistan, and secondly, by  securing for Afghan interests as large a  share as possible of theprofits to be  gained from the manufacture and distribution of goods  consumedin the country.  With these ends in view  a monopolist State trading company was established as an offshoot of the National Bank, to deal directly with foreignfirms  and thus cut out middlemen&apos;s profits, and to organise the better utilisation of the raw products which are the chief resources of the country and have hitherto been sold more or less in their natural state.   The most important of these  isPersian lambskin, a valuable fur, the yearly export of which brings in, at present prices, about  1,500,000.  Others are fruit, wool and cotton.  As a first step  inindustrialisation the Afghan authorities  wish to  establish the manufacture  of textiles and the production of sugar from beet.    6.  The  Government&apos;s  policy  met   at  first with  some  opposition   in afghanistan, and, coinciding as it did with the slump in raw  material prices  ofall kinds, seemed at first  destined to fail.  The crisis was survived, however, andall the available evidence goes to show that Afghanistan is now enjoying a greater measure of tranquillity and prosperity than for many years.  An indication  ofthe comparatively prosperous state of the country is given by the  recent issue  of currency notes, which, in contrast to two former issues  by previous regimes, hasbeen  generally  accepted,  and by the stabilisation of the exchange, which felldangerously during the crisis.    7.  The  chief difficulty in  estimating  the Afghan  economic position is the lack of any reliable financial and economic statistics.  The difficulties of the out-side observer  are increased by the absence of Indian statistics for trade across theIndo-Afghan frontier.  (The Government of  India hope soon to provide suchfigures.)  The Afghan Prime Minister stated last year that the revenue was about 2-1  million.   The State trading company and its  various  subsidiaries have announced large profits for the  short periods over which they have operated, butas these profits are usually put back into the business it is difficult to know whetherthe figures can  be trusted.  As  far as outstanding obligations  are concerned, we know only that King Amanullah was given a credit of  6 million reichsmarks  bythe German Government, repayment of which was resumed in spite of the changeof regime; secondly, that.the State trading company obtained in 1935 a Germancredit for 6^ million reichsmarks for the purchase of machinery, though the extentto which this has been drawn upon is uncertain; and it is reported that anothercredit of 10 million reichsmarks, either in replacement  of or in addition to thatof 1935, has  been  granted for  the purchase of machinery and armaments; and,thirdly, that  the Afghan  Government have undertaken to pay in instalments thepurchase price of 30,000 rifles and of a considerable amount of ammunition whichis being supplied to them  from British sources.   The total cost of these armamentsis approximately  190,000, and the liability for loss in the event of an Afghandefault would fall on the Government of India.  The Government of India havealso offered  to  purchase  and to sell to the Afghan Government on credit termssome  aeroplanes to the value of about  30,000 this year, with the possibility  offurther supplies in future years.    8.  In general it may be said  that the Afghan economic position has boththe weakness and  the  strength  of primitive economies.   It is dependent on theworld prices of a few primary products  and is thus  particularly  liable to theeffects of depressions.  The economic machinery is undeveloped,  and its controlrendered difficult  by  the absence of  data.    On the other hand, the economic structure of  the country  can, owing to its very lack of complication, continue  to function in  conditions which  would prove fatal  to a  more highly articulatedsystem.  To this must largely be attributed the success of the Afghan authoritiesin surviving  the series of difficulties which beset them in 1934.    9.  As  regards foreign  trade, Germany, as has been  stated,  has grantedconsiderable  credits to the Afghan authorities  and has already supplied a certainamount.of machinery.  The Afghan Government are also believed to have boughta substantial quantity of arms  from Germany.   It  has, moreover,  just beenreported on good authority from Berlin that the Afghan authorities are on thepoint of concluding an  agreement with a number of  German firms whereby a concession for the exploitation  of the mineral resources  of Afghanistan would  begiven tc   a  joint  German-Afghan  group.   Lately  Japanese  imports   to
3152Afghanistan are competing successfully with Indian and British goods, although this trade is now being restricted by the Afghan Government.  There have beenfew signs of Italian commercial activity in Afghanistan, but the Afghan Govefn-ment  employ -an Italian financial adviser,  and the  Italian  Government are believed to be anxious to sell them  aircraft.   The Soviet Union has an over-overwhelmingly favourable geographical position for trade with Afghanistan, andin large areas in the north Soviet imports predominate; but the Afghan Govern-ment have frequently refused to commit  themselves to a full commercial agree-ment with the Soviet  Government of the  kind that the latter would like.  Theyhave recently concluded an agreement for the barter of certain stated  amounts of commodities over the next three years, which appears to give some  advantage to Afghanistan, but which, in any case, assures that Soviet imports will at least be maintained at their present figure and in some cases  will probably increase.The Afghan Government, with the example of Persia before their eyes,  are clearlydetermined,  even at  some present loss  to  themselves, not to become entirelydependent on trade  with  the Soviet Union if this can be, by any means,  avoided;and it is largely in  order to avoid it that they now desire to place orders in thiscountry.    10.  The present state  of British and  Indian trade with Afghanistan  onthe other hand cannot be  viewed with  satisfaction.   The  Afghans export asubstantial proportion of their crop of Persian lambskins to London and wooland dried fruit to India, and buy in return mainly textiles and  hardware; butthe head of  the Afghan  National  Bank stated in- May last that, while Afghantrade relations with Russia and Germany were on a satisfactory basis, importsfrom Great Britain now amount to only 5 per cent, of the total, as compared with64 per cent, twenty-five years ago,  and although these figures cannot be checked,the situation has undoubtedly deteriorated.    11.  The Afghan authorities are not pleased with this position,  and we are convinced by the information at our disposal that they sincerely want  to increase their  purchases from this country, particularly of machinery,  that the  mainobstacle is their inability to pay for such purchases except on credit, and thatthere is no likelihood of their defaulting of their own will on any  obligations which they might incur towards us.  The economic structure of Afghanistan is so new and unknown that it is perhaps natural  that  British  traders shouldhesitate to trade on credit there; but we believe that,  if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment gave them a  lead,  they might soon find  a profitable new outlet for theirgoods  and gain confidence to enable them to dispense with any extraordinaryGovernment support.    12.  Since  1919  the only financial assistance given to Afghanistan by HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the Government of India has  been the gifts (technically&quot; loans without interest &quot;) made to King Nadir Shah in 1930-31  by the Govern -ment of India, to help him stabilise the  country.  These amounted to  175,000;and rifles and ammunition  were given at  the same  time  to the &apos; value,  ofapproximately another  100,000.   The first Afghan  request for assistance bymeans of credits for  the import of British goods was made early in 1935,  whenthe  Afghan economic crisis  was severe, and was  warmly supported  by HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul. After consultation with the Government of IndiaHis Majesty&apos;s  Government  replied by  offering  to send a financial expert  toexamine the economic and  financial situation in  Afghanistan.  The AfghanGovernment had to refuse this offer for political reasons (fear  of propagandaabout foreign interference, &amp;c), but they have stated that it might be  practicableat a later date.                                 .                         &apos;  :     13.  In February of last year the Afghan Minister for Foreign  Affairs,  in conversation with  the Secretary of State  for  Foreign Affairs, renewed  hisGovernment&apos;s request for export  credits, preferably in the: form of a generalbanking credit up to a sum of  500,000.   The Afghan Minister in London lateremphasised that, if a direct credit of this kind could be granted in principle tothe London branch of the Afghan  state trading company (not an export credit toa British firm), his Government would accept a sum  of only   250,000 or even 100,000.  In reply to this request, Mr. Eden explained the working of the export credits scheme  in this country and promised further investigation^  which -wasthen undertaken by the Foreign  Office.  The request  of a  British  firm  for       [14467]                                                    B 2
assistance by export credit guarantee in the export of a consignment of machinery to Afghanistan was already at that time under discussion with the Export credits guarantee Department, who eventually passed the correspondence on this subjectto the  Treasury for further information.   The request of the  Afghan Ministerfor Foreign Affairs was, therefore, communicated  to the Treasury directly.  Theyreplied that they had  no power to facilitate the opening of any such credit apartfrom the facilities available through the Export Credits Guarantee Department,and that the use of these facilities in any individual case was primarily a matter for that department.  .     14.  Meanwhile,  an alternative method of approach had been tried, as theresult  of a suggestion by the Afghan Prime  Minister that we  might conclude a trade  agreement with  his  Government.   The  Board  of Trade  rejected thissuggestion,  however,  on the  ground  that the  Fur Trade  Association, whoseco-operation would be essential for the conclusion of such an agreement, were notin a position to commit themselves to take a stated amount of Afghan furs.     15.  We are aware that it may appear, at first sight, that so primitive and,until recently, so unstable a country is not a suitable  recipient for a British credit,or  alternatively that, as it seems  that the first  stage  of development is  beingsuccessfully passed, there is no immediate necessity for  assistance on the part ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.   In our view, however, the political and  economic considerations  set out  below should  outweigh  such objections.   The AfghanGovernment are so evidently determined to develop the proposed industrialisationof Afghanistan that  they  will not be deterred by  the  absence of support fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government; and  if this  development  fails, the  economic andpolitical consequences might be so marked as  to endanger the stability of thecountry,  which His Majesty&apos;s Government have often affirmed to be a  factor off first importance for the defence of  India.   It would therefore be to the political advantage of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the programme should not fail; and,if it succeeded with their participation,  the  result should be materially as wellas politically profitable  to British interests.  If, however, it succeeds without it,but with the participation  of  other countries who have  shown  their readiness tohelp, British traders will find themselves shut out of an increasing market, both because traders of other countries will have established connexions there, and because the  Afghan Government,  who have the power  to  divert trade into anychannels they choose,  are likely to encourage trade with those countries -whichhelped them before the result of their efforts was clear, rather  than with countrTeswhich  refused to do so.  The Soviet Government and German traders&apos; have shownthat they are willing  to incur some risk now  in supplying goods to Afghanistanin the  hope that they may thus establish a position which will be profitable tothem if  and when Afghan  industrialisation succeeds.  Soviet predominance inAfghan  trade  could not from any angle  be  regarded with  equanimity by HisMajesty&apos;s Government; nor, surely, can they remain indifferent, from the pointof view of British trade interests and of their general policy, to this most advancedmanifestation of the German  trade &quot; drive &quot; in  the Near and  Middle East.   in short,  as the political urgency for  giving assistance due to our interest in theprevention  of chaos decreases,  so the   commercial  advantage  of  doing- soincreases.     16.  There is, moreover,  a further political argument,  which will remain-cogent whatever the internal state of Afghanistan.  It is clearly to our advantage that Afghanistan  should be not only stable but friendly;  but the earlier historyof our relations with Afghanistan left a legacy of distrust and during recenttimes  one of the objects of British policy towards Afghanistan has  had to bethe removal of Afghan suspicions of our  intentions. In  the last few  years thispolicy  has met with considerable success;  but the Afghan Government still take every  opportunity of representing to  us  that the  policy of  the Government ofIndia  on the North-West  Frontier takes too  little account of their  interests.They have, moreover,  pointed out that, as an incidental result of the maintenanceof their own position  in Afghanistan, they have established a stable and friendlybuffer  state on our frontier, thus decreasing our  imperial commitments  to asubstantial extent.  It is therefore possible that failure to make  now some positive-contribution to the improvement  of British-Afghan relations might  lead to a renewal of  Afghan suspicions of our policy and  thus increase our  difficulties.
5153In view of the repeated requests of the Afghan Government and of their generalsituation, this contribution on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government could most effectively take the form of economic interest or assistance, which would, at thesame time, be beneficial to British trade in the long run.    17.  On  all the  above grounds, therefore, we are anxious that the AfghanGovernment&apos;s request for a small credit for the purchase of goods in this country should be granted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.  TheGovernment of India, in our view, should not be asked to contribute to the credit,since British-Afghan trade  is of  little direct  advantage to Indian  traders, andthe Government of  India have already contributed to the cost of  maintainingAfghan stability, both by  their assistance to King Nadir Shah mentioned above,and by their recent action in setting up a reserve fund into which  37,500 is paideach year to accumulate up to  187,500 to be used partly for financing the currentsupplies on credit of  arms  and aeroplanes to Afghanistan and some other services which are under contemplation, and partly as a reserve which will make possiblefurther grants of assistance in any future emergency.    18.  When the Chancellor of  the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade were consulted on this question, the former replied that the use of thefacilities  available  through  the  Export  Credits Guarantee Department was primarily a matter  for that Department, which  was administered on strictlycommercial lines.  He undertook, however, to bear in mind the political considera-tions involved if any  recommendation were made to him by the Department.  ThePresident replied that the Export Credits Guarantee Department were requiredby Statute to consult their Advisory Committee whose function it was to make recommendations on the financial and business merits of any proposal laid beforethem to the exclusion of all other  considerations; he feared that there was  little chance that the Committee would look with favour on our proposal.  The relevantstatutes,  hoAvever, do not  lay down that the President must follow the advice ofthe Advisory Committee of the Export Credits Guarantee Department; nor  dothey  provide  that  the Committee must confine  themselves  to  financial and business  considerations.  Naturally  most cases must be decided in  the light  ofthese considerations,  but our view is that in the present case the considerations of public policy involved outweigh those of finance.    19.   Our suggestion is     (a) that  the  Cabinet  should  accept our view that  the machinery of the          Export Credits Guarantee  Department should  be applied  to United          Kingdom  exports to Afghanistan;    (6) that the Afghan Prime Minister, during his forthcoming visit, should, if          necessary, be informed of this decision; and    (c) that the Departments concerned  should be  instructed to work out a          scheme for implementing  this decision.  A possible arrangement would          be one similar to that adopted  in the recent export credit agreement          with the Soviet Government, whereby the Export Credits Guarantee          Department would guarantee promissory notes  issued by  the Afghan          National Bank up to a stated sum, which might be a quarter  of a          million pounds.                                                                   A.  E.                                                                   Z.   January 21, 1937.
