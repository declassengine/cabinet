THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. IS (37).CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH  THE  IRISH  FREE  STATE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    MY colleagues will wish to know my views as to the attitude which we should adopt towards the recent Irish Free State legislation.   It is not easy to define theconstitutional position of the Free State as described by Mr. de Valera in histalks with me.  It appears clear, however, that in his view the Free State remainsa full Member of the  British Commonwealth of Nations,  the King is King ofIreland and  the symbol of association in the Commonwealth,  and, although nofunctions will in future be performed by His Majesty, or  his representative, inthe internal  affairs of  the Free  State, he will continue to  perform for the  FreeState all the constitutional functions which he performs for any of the Dominionsregarding external affairs.   These facts  are very inadequately and unsatisf ac-satisfactorily expressed in the  new Irish Free State legislation.  On the other hand,  they receive more  definite expression in some of Mr. cle Valera&apos;s utterances in the  Daildebates,  and  he agrees that the  position can be publicly  stated as defined above.    The Cabinet have now to consider what, in their view, is the effect of all thison the Free State&apos;s relationship to this country and the Commonwealth.  It is not an  easy question to decide, and there  are arguments both  for and  againstaccepting the position.  It  seems to me that the main considerations  are asfollows  :                 I. Arguments against accepting the position.(a)  What Mr.  de Valera has done is a definite breach  of the Treaty with the      Irish Free State.  For example, according to the terms  of  the Treaty, the      constitutional arrangements in the Free State were to be the same as those      in the Dominion of Canada, where the King, of course,  continues through      the Governor-General to perform all his functions as head of the Executive      and part of the Legislature in the Dominion.  We shall be charged with      weakness if we acquiesce  in this further serious breach  of a Treaty freely      agreed with the Irish Free State authorities.          The Cabinet will keep in mind that Mr. de Valera&apos;s  Government broke      the Treaty, in our opinion, long  ago, as, for example, when he abolished      the Oath iaken by the Members of the Dail.  Our protests wei*e unavailing.      If we  protest now that we cannot agree to what has been done because      under  the  Treaty  it ought only  to have been  done  after  discussion  and      agreement with  us; we shall be equally unsuccessful in gaining our point,   -   and any prospect of a  satisfactory  general settlement with the  Free State      will become more distant  than  ever.  If we decide to accept the situation:      which has been created we could, of course, in making an announcement on      the matter, say something to the effect that we  regretted that the changes      had been made without consultation and agreement with us, since  in our      view that would have  been proper under the Treaty, but that ....  &amp;c.

(b) In depriving the King of all his functions in internal affairs and omitting his      name from  the  Constitution, the Irish  Free State have set. a very bad     : example to other Dominions, which may  be followed. if. the Free. State  are      now allowed to  remain full members of the Commonwealth,   In. South      Africa  . especially   there   is... a  considerable  Republican   movement.    ,  Generals Rertzog and Smuts have been  putting up a stiff and successful      fight  againsh it, and have thoroughly  established &quot;the  KingV position.      Should  the hew  situation in the  Irish Free State be accepted, the South.     -African Republicans would undoubtedly make great capital out of it. V  . General Hertzog will, I think, be  considerably, embarrassed, and in the end      we may find that developments  of a similar kind occur in the Union.  The      Free State&apos;s bad example may also have a damaging effect in India, and no      doubt the  Secretary of State for India will have something to say on this      point.   This seems to me the weightiest argument of all against accepting      Mr. de  Valera&apos;s proposition.   If we accept, it may be  the prelude to a      weakening of the position of the  Monarchy in other parts  of the Empire.      I have considered whether any case can  be made out for saying that  the      Irish  Free State is  in a special position, and that  constitutional changes      are  therefore justifiable there which could not be permitted in any other      Dominion. But  beyond the fact that Ireland is one of the mother countries    -  of the Commonwealth Avhich seems wholly irrelevant there is no reason      for constitutional changes in the Irish Free State which would not equally      apply in the case of any of the other Dominions.          I do not hide from my colleagues my uneasiness regarding this con-      sideration.  But  there is something to be  said on the other side.  First,  the      other Dominions are already rather inclined to regard the Irish as curious      people who must do things differently from everybody else, and an example      from the Irish Free State is likely to be less infectious than  an example      from anywhere else.   Secondly, the example which even the Irish Free State      is setting  is not, in fact, an example of  a Republic within the Common-      wealth.  In the  Dail debates Mr. de Valera  made it clear that  he  was      rejecting the solution of establishing a Republic now,  and he  agrees that      the King is  King of Ireland.  So there is a definite limit to the degree to      which Republicans in South Africa or elsewhere can press their advantage.      To a certain extent, and possibly a large extent, what Mr. de Valera has      done may  weaken Republican propaganda in the Irish Free State itself.      It must  be a very serious blow to the Republicans there that their unrivalled      leader has recognised the  position of  the Crown  and actually passed      legislation to maintain  it in some form.  It is true that  Mr. de Valera      himself  still hankers  after a united Irish Republic within the  Common-   -   wealth.  He told me so  frankly, but at the same time he  kept  saying that      in five  or ten years&apos; time  the Irish, who  could only accept the King      reluctantly now, may have learned to accept him more readily.  I believe      that this legislation really represents the beginning of Mr. de Valera&apos;s own      permanent acceptance of the King as King  of Ireland  and head  of  the      Commonwealth.   Though the King&apos;s position  as the Head of each separate      Government in the Commonwealth will undoubtedly be shaken, in the long      run his position as head of the Commonwealth may be greatly strengthened.ic) Perhaps  the theory  that this  legislation represents  the   beginning  of      Mr.  de Valera&apos;s permanent  acceptance of  the  King  is wrong,  and      depriving the King of  his  functions in  internal affairs is only one  step      in the direction  of abolishing  the King altogether.  If this  is so, there      is much to be said for making a stand  now and refusing to accept  the      abolition  of the King&apos;s  functions  in  internal affairs.   But my  own      impression for what  it  is worth is that the theory  is not wrong.  Mr. de      Valera  wants a united Ireland,  and he  also wants to remain a member      of the Commonwealth of  Nations, and I believe he is at  least  convinced !/i    that he cannot attain either of these objects unless he is ready to accept      the King.    &apos;              ;(d)  If we accept the altered position in the Irish Free State, and permit the Free  i    State to continue as a Member of the Commonwealth entitled  to enjoy all      the privileges (such as  Imperial  preference)  of membership^ the claim of      foreign countries to those privileges under the most-favoured-nation clauses
      of our commercial treaties may be pressed with renewed vigour.  It may     &quot;be argued that so long as the King was  undoubtedly King in all the      countries of the  Commonwealth it could be truly said that  the relation      of one member of the Commonwealth to another was different from that      of a foreign country to a member of the Commonwealth, but that the Irish      Free State legislation alters the position of the King sufficiently to destroy      the old state of affairs.  It seems to me as a layman that the facts that the      King&apos;s title remains unaltered, and that he continues to perform all his      functions regarding the Free State&apos;s relations with the rest of the world      provide an answer to this.             IT.--Arguments in favour of accepting the position.(a)  We  shall be in an awkward position if we endeavour to force the Irish Free      State out of the Commonwealth on account of this legislation.  We  shall      be forcing them out when Mr. de Yalera is saying that he and his Govern-      ment  have voluntarily  accepted the  King  as King  of  Ireland,  and      voluntarily confirmed to him  all his functions  in external affairs.   I      understand that, in fact, since the passage of the Free State legislation,      one  or two submissions have already  come to His  Majesty from the Irish      Free State regarding the appointment of Consuls.(Jb)  If we do not  accept the position, the quarrel with the Irish Free State will      continue and  grow worse.  Our enemies in every part of the world will      rejoice.  On the other hand, if we can accept the position and consequently      there is  an improvement in relations between the  two countries,  followed      possibly  by agreements on some other outstanding questions, Great Britain      will add to her prestige at a moment when this would be very useful.   The      world  will be impressed by  our ability to  settle peacefully our  disputes      within the Commonwealth.(c)  From the defence point of view, agreement will be helpful and disagreement      harmful.  In  the latter case Southern Ireland will become a more and more      unfriendly country on our flank.  If we become involved in war in those      circumstances, the Free State people  certainly would not be in a mood to      come to our support.   Presumably, owing to the vital importance to us of      the use of Southern Irish ports, we should then have to occupy parts of      Ireland by force and possibly reconquer the island and the history of the      last  few  centuries would begin again.   On the other hand, if we can  agree.      to the new constitutional legislation, the way seems  open for a much greater      measure  of co-operation in matters of defence.  Our island security would      be considerably increased.   I would refer to what Mr. de Valera said to      me upon this question as reported in Section W of my Memorandum      (CP. 14 (37)).(d)  The constitutional  arrangements  of the  British Empire have never  been      static. They have gone through a process of constant evolution.   There is.      no particular  reason why a  condition in  which the sovereign Dominions      all have  Governors-General representing the King  and performing in each      case precisely the same functions in  the executive and legislature of the      country,  should be the final form, of that evolution.  It would not be out      of accord with our conception of the Commonwealth as an association of      nations  who are free in their internal affairs and united  together on      all matters of common concern, if some variety in their Constitutions, so      far  as internal affairs are concerned, Avere permitted,  provided  that the      essential principles  and institutions  of the Commonwealth  as such, are      maintained.   Recent discussions in the Irish  Situation Committee have      revealed  two essential principles.  First, the position  of the King as  King      of the member States and head of the Commonwealth must be secured.      Despite  the unsatisfactory language  of the  Free State legislation,  the      present  proposals do not,  in  fact,  appear  to  destroy that principle.      Second,  there must be a  real  will to co-operate between, the  different      Members of the Commonwealth.  So far as the  Irish  Free  State  is      concerned, I think that the  will  to co-operate will  grow as a  result of      acceptance of the new arrangement.  I would point out that this will      to co-operate  is as important  as, if  not more important than,  anything      else.   If the  will to co-operate  is lacking,  nothing  else  can  save  the      [14455]                                                    B  2
       Commonwealth of Nations in the long run.  If there is a growing will to       co-operate amongst  ail the members, it will be difficult for anything to       break the Commonwealth.  Some Dominions have got&apos; into an extremely       Unfortunate habit&apos;in recent years pi-subordinating- the-consideration of       co-operation between  the members  to a cpnstant insistence  on  their       separate national rights.  Yet it seems to  me tliat this  is inevitable in the       present  phase,  when  the  Dominions  have just  won their  national       sovereignty, and are anxious to demonstrate it on any and every occasion.       In time they will grow less insistent  on that and emphasise again the       necessity of co-operation between the  community of nations.   It  is the       function  of  Great Britain during these difficult years  to be patient with       the nationalist enthusiasm  of the Dominions,  and to  foster,  whenever       opportunity offers, the spirit of co-operation. (e) The  question whether  the Free  State legislation does or  does not  alter her       relationship to the Commonwealth is one which cannot properly be settled       between the Free State and the United Kingdom alone.   It is a matter of       common concern, and the other Dominions Have the right to&apos; express their       views  Though they will all, I believe, regret as profoundly as&apos; we do the       Free State&apos;s action  in depriving the  King of his  functions  in internal       affairs, I do not think that any of them will consider that this  is sufficient       to put the Irish Free State out of the&apos; Commonwealth.   Oh the  contrary,       indications which I  have recently received of the views of Mr. Mackenzie       King  and General Smuts, for example, show that they would be willing       to go  to considerable lengths by way of  concession to keep  the Irish Free       State  in the Commonwealth.     My  own view is that the balance of  arguments is definitely in favour of our agreeing that the new situation does not alter the Irish Free State&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth.  My colleagues  will remember that  I reported  before Christmas that  the members of the&apos; Irish Situation Committee felt inclined, on the information then before them, to recommend that we should agree that the changes  made were not so great that they should  be rejected by us.  I think that on tile whole the further information which Mr.  de Valera gave me strengthens that view.     The  main difficulty is that the legislative  documents  do not define the position  as clearly and accurately as  Mr.&quot;de Valera &quot;is&quot; ready to define it both in private conversation and public speech.  The question arises then whether we can do anything  to get the documents improved.  Tani hot  very hopeful that this is possible.   Mr. de  Valera&apos;s difficulties with regard to this are  described in my account of my talks with him.  But  no harm would be done, and some good might result, if we continued to&apos; urge informally upon him such points as I made to him, as outlined in Section II of my  Memorandum.     I am more hopeful that we may be able to persuade him to attend the Imperial Conference and  to subscribe to  a Declaration1 describing the ideals and  purposes of the British Commonwealth of Nations, in the course of which the Crown would be referred to as the symbol of our association.   I  think that we should take every suitable opportunity of urging this  proposal upon him. &apos;     If this general policy commends itself to the  Cabinet, I suggest also that thediscussions between officials on  some&quot; of the other outstanding questions between the two countries (i.e., the Treaty Ports,  the financial dispute, and trade)  should be resumed at an early date.  Our officials for these talks are appointed and have received  their instructions.   Indeed,  they pursued  these-talks  up to a certain point,&apos; where they broke down on the constitutional  issue.  If that issue is nowdisposed  of,  the discussions could be  renewed  with a better prospect of&quot; success.     I therefore  recommend that-     1.  We should agree that the recent Irish Free State constitutional legislation           does not alter her position 3 S  cl Dominion.     2.  We should ponmiunicate this view to the other Dominions,  and ask them           whether they agree with it.     3.  We should continue to urge informally upon Mr. de Valera the desirability           of considering  alterations in the  language of the legislation  which           would make clearer the Irish Free State&apos;s  full membership of the           Commonwealth and recognition of the King..
4.  We should endeavour to persuade  him  to  subscribe to  an Imperial -   -  Conference  Declaration in the course of  which the position of the      Crown as the symbol of the-&apos;free association of the members of the      Commonwealth was confirmed.  .               m  /   &apos;5.  The discussions between  officials on  defence, the financial dispute and      trade should be resumed as soon as possible.s-&apos;  .::                              V   ,&quot;&apos;&quot;  M-  M  &apos;January  18, 1937./
