THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 14 (37).CABINET.RELATIONS  WITH  THE IRISH  FREE  STATE.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I HAD two long conversations with Mr. de Valera on Thursday.  Throughoutthe President was very, friendly, and was ready as always to express his views fully and frankly.   The following is a summary of the main points which we discussed.I fear the account is long and that there is much tedious detail in Section II, butthis is inevitable.                                     I.    With regard to the recent constitutional legislation,  after expressing our appreciation  of his  action (taken in  difficult  circumstances) in summoning the dail at short notice so that his Bill regularising the abdication and King George&apos;ssuccession should pass as nearly as possible at  the same time as ours, I said thatI noted the distinction which he himself had  always drawn regarding different kinds of Irish Free State legislation.   He had said that Bills dealing with FreeState  internal affairs were a matter of concern to the Irish Free State alone, andto no  other country.   On the other hand, legislation relating to the Free State&apos;s association with the other Members of the British Commonwealth was,  he had said publicly, a matter of concern also to those other countries; the terms of theassociation of  the Irish Free  State  with  them were  matters  to  be settled inconsultation and by agreement.   I pointed out  that, whereas it could be said thatalmost the whole of his recent Act No.. 1 could be described as touching internal affairs only, Act No. 2 dealt with the  Free State&apos;s  relationship to the Common-wealth,  and one clause  in Act No. 1  also  touched on this matter.  I thought,therefore, that  he would agree that these parts of the legislation were of concern to the other Members of the Commonwealth, and that  their Governments  shouldbe informed of  the provisions made, lest they wished to  make any comments.  Wein the United Kingdom appreciated that the  circumstances of the recent crisishad been such that he had not been able to inform the  rest of us of the terms ofhis proposed  Bills before they were introduced and passed in the Dail.  But, inour view,  it would be proper if he were to send the full text of the Acts to theother  Dominions,  as he had done to us, for their consideration now.    Mr. de Valera replied that he had considered this, but it did not seem  to himnecessary  to consult other members of the Commonwealth on the subject.   If thelegislation which had been passed had made any fundamental  alteration  in the relation of the Irish Free State to the Commonwealth, he would agree that that course would be proper.   But the legislation did not make any such alteration.The Irish Free State remained a full Member of the Commonwealth, and the Kingwould continue to perform all  the functions which during recent years he hadpersonally and directly performed in  relation to the Irish  Free State.    I said that that might be his view, but that the Irish Free State Governmentcould not settle the point by themselves. Other Members of the Commonwealthmight take the view that what had been done  did fundamentally alter the IrishFree  State&apos;s  relationship to them. If they took that view they were entitled to urge  it.  I did not know what view the United Kingdom Cabinet would take onthe matter; we had postponed discussing it in detail and reaching any conclusionsupon  it until we possessed fuller information.  It was  of course possible that weshould feel able to agree with  him that nothing fundamental had  been altered,
but we might take the opposite view.  In any case, it seemed to me necessary thatwe and the other Dominions should all have full information as &quot;soon as possibleas to what had been done, so that we could reach our conclusions.  It would be extremely unsatisfactory if the matter were left in the air, and nobody felt certainas to&apos;whether Mr. de Valera&apos;s interpretation was agreeable to the partners in theCommonwealth.    I returned to this point later in the conversation.  He was still reluctant to circulate the texts of the Acts to the other Dominions, as he sincerely and firmlyheld that no fundamental change had been made.  I asked him then whether hewould  agree that the United Kingdom Government,  if they felt it necessary after their consideration  of the matter, should be free to send what information they wished to all the other  Dominions, as well  as any  views which they  themselvesheld and thought the other Dominions ought to be aware of.   He agreed to this procedure. W&apos;&apos;.-.&apos;                             &apos;  II.    I told him that we, for our part, were studying the documents and the Daildebates.  We had two anxieties in the matter.  First, we wished to do everything possible  to  facilitate true co-operation between the nations who were freelyassociated in the Commonwealth and to remove any  obstacles to that co-operation which  could properly be removed.  Second, we thought it imperative to maintainthe essential principles whatever they might be of the association between theMembers of the Commonwealth, which made that association something special and justified the Members in giving advantages to each other as against foreign nations.  It seemed to us that one of those principles was the recognition of theCrown as the symbol of the association.  If that recognition ceased on the partof any one of the Members, I thought it would be difficult, and indeed impossible,to resist  the claim of foreign countries that they should, en joy exactly the sameprivileges as that Member enjoyed  in  relation to the Commonwealth.  I under-stood,  lor example, that the wording  of  many of  our commercial treaties was such that&apos; if the Crown ceased to be recognised by any one of the Members, that member&apos;s right to Imperial  preference  would disappear.  He  and  I in our conversations had been accustomed to speak frankly to each other,  and thereforeI would repeat that, whether he liked it or not, the position of the Crown seemedto me,  and  I believed to all my colleagues,  to be an essential point.  I thoughtthat the other Dominions would take the same view, since their own privileges as members of the Commonwealth would be jeopardised if that principle were givenaway.  For this reason we, for our own part, profoundly regretted the provisionsof his  Act No.  1 which  abolished all the King&apos;s functions in the internal affairs of the  Irish Free State.   Those provisions made considerable alterations in theposition; perhaps they  were not fundamental alterations; we  should have toconsider  that.  But at the very least they tended to weaken  the position of theCrown in the eyes of the rest of the world.  On the other hand, we noted that hehad deliberately kept Article 1 in the Constitution, by which the Irish Free state is declared to be &quot;a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming theBritish Commonwealth of Nations,&quot; and also that, although the King&apos;s functions in internal  affairs had all disappeared, some functions  were reserved to him inthe external affairs of the Free State.  He himself claimed that the legislationmade no fundamental change.   So that I might give my colleagues a completepicture of the intention and effect of the legislation as he saw it, I should like toask him  for further information on some  points.   He readily agreed to give meany information, and we  discussed the following points :-    (i) In Clause 3 (i) of Act No. 2, dealing with the King&apos;s functions regardingexternal  affairs, I said that I thought the wording was open to the interpretationthat the Irish Free State did not regard itself as a full Member, like all the otherMembers, of the Commonwealth.   It  ran:  &quot; .  . . . so long as the Irish  FreeState is associated with the following nations, that is to say,  Australia, Canada,Great  Britain, New Zealand and South Africa, and so long as the King recog-nised by those nations  as the symbol  of their co-operation continues  to act onbehalf of each of those nations .... the King so recognised may, and is herebyauthorised to, act on behalf of the Irish Free State . . .  .&quot;   In this context thewords  &apos;&apos; symbol of their co-operation &apos;&apos; might be read to mean that  the  king was recognised as the symbol of co-operation between the other Members of the
 Commonwealth, but was not recognised by the Irish Free State as the symbol of its co-operation also.   It might be said that the Irish Free State&apos;s membership of the  association was something in the nature of an associate membership rather than full membership.  This would appear to conflict somewhat with. Article 1 of the  Constitution, which he had deliberately retained, which said that the Irish Free State was a co-equal Member of the  Commonwealth.  Could I assume that Clause 3 (i) was not intended to mean that the Irish Free State did not recognise the Crown as the symbol of  its co-operation with the other Members?    He said that the point was new to him.  It  had not been pointed  out by any of his  advisers  during the  discussion of  the draft Bills in  Dublin. I  would realise that the Bills had had tO&apos;be drawn up hurriedly and that possible imper- fections Of expression had crept into them.   He had done his best to get the Bills drafted very carefully so that there would be no such points.   But he saw that the interpretation which I had given might be put upon Clatise 3 (i).   He would explain what he had in mind in&apos; phrasing the clause in that way.  He would say frankly that the majority of people in the  Free  State felt no enthusiasm for the Crown.  On the contrary, for  them it  had unfortunate historical associations. He himself thought that the ideal position would be if Ireland could become a Republic and still be associated as a Member of  the Commonwealth;  that would enable  the majority of  Irishmen to co-Operate fully and whole-heartedly in Commonwealth affairs.   Therefore, they themselves would not have  chosen the Crown as the symbol of co-operation.   But they had to recognise that the other Members of the  Commonwealth wished it  to be so, and what he had intended to convey in Clause 3  (i) was that, so  long as the other Members wished this to be the symbol of their  co-operation, and so long as  the Irish Free State remained a Member  of the Commonwealth, the Irish  Free  State  also would recognise the Crown as the symbol of its co-operation with them.    I pointed out that be had not said this in Clause 3 (i).  Would there be any difficulty about his  redrafting the Clause so that at least that much  was said ? I said that I was  not,  of  course,  making any  formal  suggestion;  I was not authorised to do so, and the  point had not even been discussed in the  Cabinet; I was putting the suggestion forward rather as a  means of learning exactly what was in his mind, so  that I could give full information to my colleagues.  He said that he would take note of  the point I had made and see whether he could do anything  about it.  But he  said that he would  be extremely reluctant to make any alteration whatever in Act No.  2.   It had been very difficult for many of his supporters to accept this measure, but they had  done so, and it  was now on the Statute Book of the Irish Free State.   If he were to introduce amendments now the whole matter would be discussed afresh in the Dail;  it would be  impossible to limit the discussion again on the ground  that there was still an emergency and that the Bill must be passed  under a guillotine motion, and the result might well be that members of the Dail would force other amendments to the measure and do damage.    He then said that he ought to let me know that  he  did not  propose to incorporate Article  1  of  the existing Constitution, which refers to Membership of the  Commonwealth, in the  new Constitution  Bill which he would introduce in the  Dail shortly after its reassembly.   As I knew, the existing Act No. 1, dealing with internal  affairs, was  a  makeshift measure  which  he had felt it necessary to put through on account of the recent crisis.  Both it and the existing Constitution would  disappear when the new Constitution Bill which he proposedto introduce shortly became law; that Bill would provide for a popularly elected President and the other constitutional organs which he had been contemplating for some time.   It  would not  contain Clause 1  of the existing  Constitution or anything equivalent to it.    I answered that this information  seemed to  me rather serious, and certainly made the point which I had just raised about Clause 3 (i) of  Act No. 2 all the more important.  As I understood it, he proposed that the new Constitution Bill should  contain  the law  so  far as internal affairs were concerned,   and that Act No. 2 would remain as a sort of partner to it, dealing with external affairs. In that case the only reference to the association with the Commonwealth wouldbe in Clause 3 of the latter  Act, and,  read by itself, this was open to the inter- pretation which I had pointed out. Moreover, the deliberate omission of Article 1 in the  existing  Constitution from  the  new&quot; Constitution would  aggravate the difficulty.  It would be  remarked  upon,  and people would  naturally seek  aux
explanation for its omission.  They would  say that the reason for omitting itwas obviously that the Irish Free State did  not intend to remain a full Memberof the Commonwealth, and they would feel confirmed in  this view when theyreferred to Act- No. 2 and found that the reference there seemed to indicate thatthe Free State was  not  associated in the Commonwealth in exactly  the  same manner, and did not recognise fully the same symbol, as the other Members.   Onthe face of it I myself could not  see any other reason for dropping the Article.    Pie said that the exjolanation was  as follows :  he had given a public pledgethat the Constitution Act would be so drawn up that if  at  any time the IrishFree State wished to leave the Commonwealth and establish a Republic it could do so without altering anything in that Act.  If he were to keep that pledge,which he was bound to do, he could not put in a clause saying  that the Free state was a  Member of the  Commonwealth.  Therefore,  the   association  with  theCommonwealth would be  fixed, and the details of it arranged, in another Act, i.e.,the Act which was already passed.   That was the explanation of the two Acts.Although the second one  would not be  a Constitution Act, it would be a partnerto the Constitution Act,  and he  intended to provide that in fact it would be noeasier to repeal that  Act, or any section of it, than it would be to repeal or alter the Constitution Act itself.    I commented that his difficulty could be met if he transferred the existingArticle  1 to the Act  dealing with external affairs.   Could he not introduce into that Act a clause stating categorically that the Free State was a co-equal Member ?Mr. de Valera said that he saw the force of  what  I pointed out,  but that for  thereasons  which he  had already given he did not  wish  to  tamper further  withAct No. 2.   If he did, the whole issue would be raised again, and there would betrouble.  No doubt what he had done with regard to recognising the Kingappeared to us rather a small thing.  But he thought it was a big thing  from  theIrish Free State point of  view. For the first  time, his Party and Government hadvoluntarily recognised the King and passed legislation to retain him.  He himself was being fiercely criticised for  this in some quarters.  The  difficulty was thatthe Irish people did not understand the constitutional position; they thought thatthe King being there meant that the King was constantly interfering in affairs.The problem was to educate the  Irish  to understand that, though the King was there, he did not interfere of his own volition in affairs, but always acted officiallyon the advice of his Ministers.  He thought  that this process of education wouldtake a ver)r long time to complete.   As the process went on, Irishmen would becomereconciled to the King.   But if  he forced the pace now, that process  would be checked and destroyed.    I said  that  we,  of  course,  understood  his difficulties and would readilyacknowledge that  in  view of them he had  done  a big thing.   But the otherMembers of the Commonwealth had their difficulties, too.  If we were disposed atall to accept his view that he had made no fundamental change, the lack of cleardefinition of this  in  his legislation would  cause us  difficulty.   We, too,  were dependent upon the votes of our supporters in the House  of  Commons, and ourback-bench members  were just as capable as his of  making damaging criticism.I would make another suggestion to him :  if for the  reasons given he did not feel able to change the terms of his legislation, and to make the Irish Free State&apos;s.full membership of the Commonwealth and  its recognition of the King as  thesymbol of its association  with the other Members clearer than they were in  thepresent  legislation, would he be willing a little later, when the Dail debates werepast and the reasons for accepting the King were becoming  better understood by his followers, to subscribe voluntarily to some declaration which the Membersof the Commonwealth collectively might make  defining afresh the implicationsand objects of membership of  the Commonwealth?  Such a statement might,for instance,  issue  from  the forthcoming  Imperial  Conference.  Fie wouldremember that General Hertzog had proposed that a new statement was necessaryin view of the fact that some foreign countries still did not seem to understandthat the status of national sovereignty now belongs to the Dominions.  I thought there  might be advantage in the  present state of world affairs if all our Govern-ments joined in  declaiming that  the Commonwealth was  a free association  ofnations  who were united in their  belief  in freedom and  democracy and were co-operating together in  the cause of peace.  If such a declaration were made,there  should be a reference to the Crown as the  symbol  of  the association  ofthese  nations.
    He said that at  first blush he  thought that it would be difficult for him(on account of his domestic difficulties in the Irish Free State,  and not because he wished  to deny the  Crown as the symbol of association) to subscribe  to  astatement in that form; but that he would think over the matter.    With regard to all this I said that I wished to ask another question.  In theexisting Act No. 1 there was a clause which referred indirectly to the Irish  FreeState&apos;s  association with  the  Commonwealth.  The section  dealing with theamendment of Article 51 of the Constitution contained the words &quot; . . . . Providedthat it shall be lawful for the  Executive Council to the extent and subject to anycondition which may be determined by law to avail for the purposes of the appoint-ment  of diplomatic and  consular  agents  and  the  conclusion  of  international agreements of any organ used as a  constitutional organ for the  like purposes byany of the nations referred to in Article  1  of this  Constitution.&quot;   If his newConstitution was to deal strictly with internal affairs only, presumably a similarreference would  be absent.  Was that what he intended?    He said that I had put my finger on a  difficult point.  Although his adviserstold him that it would  not be necessary to include a similar clause  in the newConstitution, he was  inclined to disagree  with them.   He  thought that  such  a clause, which he called  the &quot; rivet &apos;&apos;  clause,  would be necessary in  order  to linkthe Constitution Act to  the  Act dealing with  external affairs.   His presentmind therefore was that such a clause should be included, but that it should be drafted in such general terms that  it would not need alteration if the irish people decided  to repeal Act  No. 2 and to  leave the Commonwealth.  I askedwhether, if such a clause was to appear in the new Constitution, he would proposesimply to use the term &quot; organ &quot; to describe the King. People in this country and throughout the  rest of the Commonwealth  would undoubtedly regard this  asextremely  unfortunate, to say  the  least.    They would notice that when theConstitution wished to  refer to the President of the Executive Council or to the speaker of the Dail,  it did not describe them as &quot;organs,&quot; but called them bytheir official titles.  The same  would be true of all other functionaries.  It wouldbe taken as a slight on the King if in his case only this were deliberately avoided,and such an expression as &apos;&apos; organ &quot; or &quot; instrument &apos;&apos; or anything else of thenature were employed to describe him.   If he felt it impossible to use the  term&quot;the King,&quot; would it  not be possible at least to use some such phrase as &quot;solong as the Irish Free State  remains a Member of the British Commonwealthof Nations, it shall be  lawful for  the Executive  Council to avail  .  . .  . of theKing who  is the symbol  of association  .... ? &quot;  He replied that some  suchphrase had been his own first idea.   But the  direct reference to the  King himself in the Constitution Act might wreck the  legislation, and therefore he thoughtit was impracticable.   He repeated  that  it would need time for  his people  tobecome accustomed to a completely voluntary acceptance of the King.   In five or ten years&apos; time their attitude might have  changed, but for the present he was anxious not to press them too hard.    (ii)  I  said that the next point  on which I would like fuller information was with regard to the functions which  it was proposed that the King should exercisein external affairs. In  Clause 3 (i) these functions were confined to the appoint-ment  of  diplomatic  and  Consular representatives  and  the conclusion  ofinternational agreements.  I noticed that  in Clause 3 (ii)  there was a referenceto &quot; all other, if any,- purposes &quot; which  the King might fulfil.   It might  be truethat the three functions which had  been  specifically mentioned were normally theonly constitutional functions  which His Majesty performed regarding external relations;  but there  might be other constitutional functions  which he wouldproperly perform in certain circumstances, and which he would in fact performin the case of other Members  of the Commonwealth.  Would it  be  correct to saythat the reference to  the three functions was not intended necessarily to excludeothers,  and that the later  saving  phrase meant that  if  there were any  otherconstitutional functions which the King performed in any circumstances for  otherMembers  of the  Commonwealth,  touching external relations, he  would  alsoperform these for the Irish Free State ?     Mr. de Valera replied that he understood that the three functions especiallymentioned were the only three which His Majesty performed in this sphere. Hehad deliberately tried to get an exhaustive list, and thought that he had succeeded.He had put in the saving phrase in case there were  other functions.  During the debate  in  the Dail the  question had been raised as to whether,  if the Irish Free
 State went to war, the declaration of war would be an act of the King.  He told me that before the debate the point had not struck him, that he had been thinking- over the question, and that it seemed to him that a declaration of war  by the Irish Free State would certainly require to be an act  of the King.  He did not wish me to take that as his final view, but he felt fairly certain that it was right. I said that a declaration of war would  certainly  be an act of  the King  in the case of the United Kingdom and other Members of the Commonwealth;  and that in that case I presumed the point would be  settled in the, same  way  with the Irish Free State.  Mr. de Valera agreed  that he thought this was so, saying that in fact it was intended that the King should perform for the Irish Free State in its external affairs all the constitutional functions which he  performed for the other Dominions in their external affairs, though  he wished it to  be understood that in his view the Irish Free State should be free to suggest, if they so wished, changes  in these functions, and to effect those changes if the other Members of the Commonwealth could be persuaded to agree to them.     (iii) I asked whether  the view which he  had expressed in  the Dail  debate that the existing legislation  did not alter the title  of the  King had been a tentative view, or whether it was his final view.   He  said that it was  his final view.  The King  would continue to  be  &quot;King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas.  ...&quot;  I asked whether this would, in his view, be the position after he  had  introduced his new Constitution ?   He assented to this also.  I asked whether this meant that he agreed that the King- was King throughout Ireland.  He  agreed to  this.  He emphasised the  point by remarking that in the past the Kings of England had continued  to carry in their title some reference to their being Kings of France long after they had, in fact, ceased to be so.  The reference to his being King of Ireland in  his present title would not be in the nature of  an anachronism like that.  He fully agreed that it  would be  a correct description,  and  neither he nor his  Government  would protest against its continued use.   When, at  a later stage of the conversation, I asked him whether he would be agreeable to the King  taking the following Oath at his Coronation : &apos;&apos; Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of Great Britain,  Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, of your  possessions and territories to any of them  pertaining,  and  of your Empire of India according to the  Statutes in the Parliaments agreed on and their respective laws and  customs ? &quot; he at  once  agreed in  principle, though he did not like some details of wording.  He said that the word &quot; govern  &quot; would, for example, be misunderstood and criticised in the Free State.  To many of his followers it would convey the impression that the King  could and would  interfere of his own  free will in affairs.  One  of the  difficulties was  that words  which were understood as conveying one meaning by people in this country were taken to have another meaning over there.   I pointed out to  him that  the King  would be solemnly promising- and  swearing to govern &apos;&apos; according to the Statutes  in  the Parliaments  agreed  on and their respective  laws  and customs.&quot;   Surely thatwould  not be misunderstood in  the Free State.  He agreed that this helped, and promised to submit this  form of Oath to his Cabinet colleagues and&apos; to let  me have an answer as soon as  possible.  He thought that  they would accept it, but that they might wish to suggest minor drafting alterations.  He then said,however, that another part of the Oath, referring to the (&apos; Protestant Reformed Religion,&quot; raised real difficulty for him, and that another  great difficulty  wasthe fact that the Oath would be administered  by the Archbishop of Canterbury. These  features would arouse  intense criticism amongst Irish Catholics,  and frankly he did not see the way to overcome the difficulty.  I discussed the matter with him for some time,  and have since discussed it with  the Archbishop of Canterbury, but I need not trouble my colleagues  with the point in this present memorandum.                                    III.    I said that the information which he had  given me had considerably cleared my own mind as to what his view of  the position  was, and  I felt  sure  that the Cabinet  would now be able to consider  the matter  and reach conclusions.   It seemed to me that one difficulty was that he was reluctant (for reasons which  we perfectly understood)  to use in  his actual legislative documents precise language to  describe the facts as they were.  The facts, as  he described them,  regarding Irish Free State Membership of the Commonwealth and the recognition of the
King were one thing, the Language in the Acts seemed a somewhat different thing.To put it plainly, he dared not in the documents &quot; call a spade a spade.&quot;  he admitted  that  this  really was so,  and  repeated that  his  domestic political difficulties were very real.  I assured him that Ministers here would be very readyto recognise his difficulties.   Mr. de  Valera  said  that he  equally  saw  our difficulties, and the reactions which sections of our public opinion might have tosome of the phrases in his legislation.  The last thing that he wanted to do wasto use language which would offend our people&apos;s susceptibilities.  He hoped thathe would be able to find words which were courteous and respectful.    I said that  I should certainly have to answer Questions on  the question ofthe Irish  Free State legislation in the  House  of  Commons.   I should be  asked what the United Kingdom Government thought was the effect of the recent IrishFree State  legislation on the  Free  State&apos;s  relations  with the  Commonwealth.I should have to evade a direct answer of course until the Cabinet had made up its mind on the question.  I did not know what the Cabinet would decide.   Butleaving  that out  of account for the moment, should I be  correctly representinghis  view if  I were to say in the House of  Commons something  on  these lines :&quot; The Irish Free State remains a co-equal Member  of  the  Commonwealth ofNations forming the  British Commonwealth of Nations.   Whilst it is  true thatthe recent legislation has deprived His Majesty of his functions regarding theinternal affairs of the Free State, it provides that he shall continue to exerciseall his functions regarding external affairs.   No change is involved in the King&apos;title, which is  &apos; King of  Great  Britain, Ireland  and the British dominions beyond the  Seas, Emperor  of India.&apos;  It  is  in this capacity that the King  willconclude Treaties and perform the  other functions in relation  to the external affairs of the Irish  Free State referred to  in  the legislation.&quot;  Mr.  de Valerasaid he thought that was perfectly all. right, though he would like a little time tothink it over. I could quote his own speeches and statements in the Dail as muchas I liked,  so long as I refrained from distorting their  significance by tearingthem out of their proper context!                                    IV.     I said that on  the assumption  that the United Kingdom and  the otherDominions shared his view that the position had not been fundamentally altered,I hoped that a  much greater measure  of co-operation would be possible  on all matters of common concern between our two countries.  He said that this  wouldcertainly  be so  on the Irish  side.  As he had told me repeatedly before,  themajority  of the Irish people  would not feel able to co-operate  whole-heartedlyso long as partition continued.  But if the present legislation were accepted  bythe other Members  of the  Commonwealth  as  not altering the  position funda-mentally, the situation between the Irish Free State and Great Britain  would undoubtedly be  greatly eased.   He added, however, that he himself would come in for a great deal of criticism on the following lines :  his critics would say :&quot; You have made us accept the King, and you say that we are full Members ofthe  Commonwealth,  and yet we are not.  We do not enjoy the same freedom,or the same advantages, as other Dominions.  Some of our ports are still occupiedby the British, we still have no trade treaty which gives  us Imperial preference,and so  on.&quot;  Therefore he hoped that if the  Cabinet were agreeable, we could continue the discussions on these other matters as soon as possible.   I said  thaton the assumption that the Cabinet thought the Constitutional  position was allright, I felt sure that we should be anxious to continue negotiations on other points without delay.                                     V.   .     With regard to the Treaty Ports,  he said he hoped that we should be  ableto reach an agreement by which our occupation ceased.   I reminded him that inthe  discussions  which had taken place between our officials this possibility hadbeen envisaged,  if we could reach a satisfactory agreement on the question ofthe ports in.other respects, and if we  could also reach agreement on  other  out-standing questions between the two countries.   He said that if our  occupationceased,  the way would be clear for a great measure of  co-operation.   He hadalready given a public assurance that the  Irish Free State Government  would not allow the Irish Free State to be used as  a base of attack by a hostile Power on Great Britain.   If he was going to be able to make that declaration effective, he
must get the defences of his coast and ports in good order.  He was worried aboutthe present situation, in which the defences were very inadequate.   In working out the details of a defence policy he would be anxious to co-operate fully with us.  But many of his followers would be very suspicious, and they would be par-ticularly watchful lest the Irish Free  State&apos; were  definitely committed to goingto war if Great Britain were involved in war.  He would have to assure his people that the Irish Free State retained freedom in the matter, and that if any wararose the Dail would be free to decide  whether the Free State should enter it ornot.  Therefore, he would not be able to give us any guarantee that we could useIrish Free State ports if we were involved in war.   He hoped that we would  not insist on that,  because otherwise agreement on defence would prove  impossible..    I said that he would appreciate that the use of Irish Free State ports wouldbe absolutely essential to us if we were involved  in war.   Anyone who looked ata map,  and  who understood the importance to us of adequate protection of  our trade routes, would realise that.    He replied that he personally thought that if we were involved in war weshould get the use of their ports. But we should  defeat that object if we insisted on any guarantee now, for that would make agreement and co-operation in defence policy generally impracticable.  If he was going in practice to co-operate with uswhole-heartedly, it could only be if he were able to say to his people that in caseof emergency they were free to make their  own decision.    I said that we understood his difficulty.  In fact,  the Prime Minister ofCanada and the Prime  Minister of&apos; the Union had made  declarations about  thefreedom of their Parliaments to decide in case of war, though if the Common-wealth  meant  anything at  all it meant that  ail  its members  went  to  war-together or  remained at peace together. As  between  the  Irish  Free  Stateand Great  Britain  the point could  be  examined  in  the discussions on  theTreaty  Ports, if and when we were able to continue those discussions.   We,on our side, should have to consider the matter very carefully, because no one couldescape the fact that, from the point of view of our own island defence, the use of irish ports in war was essential.    He said that, so far as the Commonwealth generally was  concerned, he feltthat if  Great  Britain became involved in war, all the Dominions would become involved.  In certain  circumstances it  might  be  difficult for Canada  to support us, but, with that exception, he thought  that a threat to the independence ofGreat Britain was a threat  to the  independence  of all of them, and to the ideasfbr which they stood.  That argument  applied particularly, in his; view, to  theIrish Free State. He thought that in case of a war the Irish people  might be alittle slower to understand this than the people of other Dominions, but that theywculd come to  understand it  he  felt  certain.   So far  as he  personally was concerned, he  held the view very strongly. Now that the  Irish Free State had won its &quot; independence,&quot; after centuries of struggle, he thought it would be extremely foolish if the  Irish people were to risk losing  their independence by allowing some other Power to threaten the independence of Great Britain.   Anattack on Britain&apos;s independence would be at once a threat to Irish independence.He went so  far as to say that if the Irish people had been  independent in 1914he himself would probably have been &quot; one of those fighting in Flanders.&quot;                                    VI.    With regard to the financial dispute, he was adamant.  He  said that hewas convinced that his case against the  payment of the Annuities to us was sound,and he could not give way on it.  I said  that we  were equally certain that  our case was right, and that we should have argued it with great confidence before any Tribunal.  He said that he appreciated this.  Therefore,  there was a  dead-lock.   His  suggestion was  that we should admit deadlock and say that, likesensible people, we proposed to treat the matter as a strictly practical proposition.He would be  ready to  give us an undertaking to spend&apos; whatever money wasnecessary on the defences of his ports and coasts for a period of years, if in returnwe would cease pressing our claim to the Annuities, which he was bound to resist.I  pointed out that the capital  value of the Land Annuities was  something like 100 millions, and that, in addition, there were certain other payments which, inour view, were due to us from the Irish Free State.  As against this, I understoodthat the cost of bringing the Free State defences up to proper requirements would

I did not think that people in this country would  support  as a  &quot; practical &quot;  agreement one which meant that  we surrendered in effect 99 per cent, of what we believed was aperfectly just claim.   Mr. de Valera said that it was not a 99 per cent, surrender.He thought that the Irish people had claims for large sums of money from GreatBritain going back to the  time of  the  Union over a century ago.   I had theimpression that Mr. de Valera is going to be extremely difficult on  this matter.I think he has given a public pledge to the effect that he will never allow any ofthe. Annuities moneys to be paid to us, and when he has  given a pledge,  I am bound to say. he abides by it.                                   VII.    With regard  to trade relations, I said that we should of course be ready todiscuss a wider trade agreement as a  part of a general  agreement.   In themeantime I  hoped that  we could agree to  extend the existing agreement for another twelve months, and that we could announce this in the communique whichwe should have to give to the Press at the end of the day. He replied that, whilsthe thought that an extension  of the existing  agreement was all that we  could achieve at the moment, he would rather that an announcement  of agreement onthis was not included in the communique. The &quot; Coal-Cattle pact &quot; was not verypopular in the Irish  Free  State, as many thought that we had driven a hardbargain and got the better of it.  If the communique appeared to show that thegreater part of his conversations with  me had been concerned with deciding to renew a rather unpopular agreement, he would get into trouble when he returnedto Dublin.                                   VIII.    I repeated that the Cabinet had not yet discussed the effects of his constitu-tional legislation, and that everything else must await our conclusions on that matter.
