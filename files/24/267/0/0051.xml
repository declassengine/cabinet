THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.          I circulate herewith for the information of my colleaguesa draft  of a report  of the result  of the Block Grant  investigationin Scotland,          Throughout this  and the  corresponding English investiga-tion the Ministry  of Health and my Department  have &quot;been in close touch and the same considerations  have &quot;been kept in view.          The proposed alterations in the distribution formula inScotland follow with minor modifications those proposed &quot;by theMinister of -Health for England and Wales.    But owing to the comparatively small  amount of new  money &quot;attracted&quot; under  theexisting Act  ( 500,000)  as compared with the very large amount ofthe Unemployment Contributions-Toeing paid &quot;by Scottish localauthorities to the Exchequer ( &quot;?56., 000),  these formula alterationstogether with adjustments  in respect of the UnemploymentContributions and  Trunk Roads*  would not  adequately meet the ratingsituation in  the necessitous areas in Scotland,    In  order to dealwith this situation  in the depressed industrial areas and  the moresparsely populated areas,  including the Highlands and Islands,  thenew money,  after taking into account the  adjustments  in respect  ofUnemployment  Contributions, and Trunk Roads,  has been  increased to 600,000,    The increased  Grant  exceeds the normal ratio under theexisting Act  but is  only sufficient  to  give to  the necessitous areas   Scotland relief broadly equivalent to what  they would have                                                        received/SECRET.&apos;&apos; &apos;*O.P.50(37).C A BI NET.LOCAL GOVERNMENT (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1929:  DISTRIBUTIONOff EXCHEQUER GRANTS:  DRAFT REPORT ON INVESTIGATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
 received if they had been in England.   These proposals have &quot;been agreed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.           I concur in the view expressed by the Minister of Health that a further Block Grant investigation is advisable before the whole of the General Exchequer Contribution is distributed on  the basis of formula.           The Scottish local authorities have represented that this should be undertaken before the end of the third fixed grant period (1942).           There are probably greater reasons in Scotland than in England for fixing this review at the end of five years. in particular the special addition made on this occasion to the new money will require reconsideration before the^. fourth fixed grant period and some consequential alteration of the distribution formula may be required.   But it is clearly desirable that Scotland and England should proceed on the same lines so far as possible and on this point I propose to consult; further with the Minister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exechequer. -&apos;           It is proposed to modify the provisions relating to  the Additional Exchequer Grant on the lines proposed in England. The question whether any adjustment should also be made in regard to Supplementary Grants in Scotland is under discussion.           I accordingly desire the authority of my colleagues  to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill giving effect to these proposals.   This Bill could if desired be co?ribined with the Bill for England and Wales,  but I believe that no ti.&amp;.e would be Raved thereby,,   The proposals have been well received in Scotland and I believe I can guarantee that no undue amount of Parliamentary time vrould be required for  their consideration.

LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  (SCOTLAND)                     ACT,  1929.Authority for investigation.   1. A  statutory  investigation  has been  proceeding  during thepast year, in consultation with the Associations of Local Authoritiesin Scotland, into the method of distribution of block grants underthe Local Government  (Scotland) Act, 1929, after the 15th  May,   The statutory  authority  for this investigation is contained inSection 72 of the Act, under which the Secretary of State for Scot-land is required to cause a report on the result of the investigation to be laid before Parliament.  The text of Section 72 is given inAppendix I, and a general outline  of the block grant provisions isgiven in paragraph 4 and Appendix II.   Concurrently with the investigation a review of the question of future unemployment contributions by Scottish  local authoritiesto the Exchequer  has been undertaken as required by Section 45of the Unemployment Act, 1934.Local authorities consulted.   2. Section 72 of the Act of 1929 provides  that the Secretary ofState should consult with  such Associations of local authorities asappeared to him to be concerned and with any local authority with whom consultation appeared to him to be desirable.  Accordingly,in January 1936, a conference was held in Edinburgh with representa-tives of the Associations of local authorities in Scotland, namely :-         The Convention of Burghs;         The Association of County Councils in Scotland; and  t&amp;      The Association of Counties  of Cities.Procedure.    3. At this  conference  the representatives of  local  authorities were asked to consider with the Secretary of State the procedure by which the  investigation  could  best be  conducted.  They were reminded that the original intention of the block grant provisionsONResult of Investigation under Section 72.1937.
was that the assistance  afforded to local authorities by means ofthe block grant should  vary with the need for  local government services in any area in relation to the ability of the area to meetthe cost.  Particular attention was also  drawn to  the desirabilityof affording within the limits of the financial provisions of the Actgreater assistance towards the special needs of necessitous areas.   It was  arranged that the three Associations should investigate the operation of the block grant  scheme ha its  several parts andconfer with the Secretary of State&apos;s Department as might be founduseful.  They were promised the fullest assistance of the Depart-ment in the investigation of the working of the scheme and of any proposals which might be made for its variation.    In accordance with the initial arrangements the representativesof the  three Associations were  furnished with relevant  statisticaland other  information  for  their consideration.  The Associationspreferred to proceed by way of separate consideration of the ques-tions involved and did  not unite  to form a joint  committee  as inEngland.  Each  Association  appointed its own  committee  ofadvisers, on which representatives of necessitous areas were included..Ezpla?iation of block grant.    4.  The provisions for determining the amount of the block grant and for distributing it to local authorities,  including the provisions relating to certain guarantee grants, are contained in Part III of theLocal  Government (Scotland) Act, 1929,  and  were explained  in Cmd.  Paper 3135, issued in 1928 (extracts therefrom are reproduced in Appendix II).    The amount  of the General Exchequer Contribution for the first fixed grant period under the Act of 1929 was slightly over  6,100,000 a year.  For  the second fixed grant  period it was slightly  over  6,200,000, equivalent to approximately 25*6 per cent, of the &quot;rate and grant borne expenditure &quot;* in the year 1931-32, the penultimate year  of the  preceding grant period.   That percentage represents the proportion which the amount of the  grant for the first fixed grant  period bore  to the total amount of rate  and grant  borne expenditure in the first year of that fixed grant period. In accordance with the provisions of  Section 53 of the Act of 1929 this minimum proportion  of  Exchequer  money must  be maintained  on  each revision of the block grant.    The Act provides for apportioning to each county and large burgh in the first and second  fixed  grant  periods an amount  equal&apos; to  75 per cent, of its estimated lossesf  on account  of rates and dis-  oontinued grants in the standard  year (1928-29), the balance of the   * &quot; Rate and grant borne expenditure &quot; means the expenditure of localauthorities  met  from  rates and  grants  out  of  the  General exchequer contribution.   j Calculated in accordance with rules laid down in the Act of 1929.
General Exchequer Contribution being distributed on the formulaof weighted population.  In the third and fourth grant periods thefigure of 75 per cent, is replaced by 50 and .25,per cent, respectively&apos;.&apos;In the fifth and&apos; succeeding grant periods the distribution will be wholly on formula.5        &apos;        .                             ;   The distribution within each comity is on the basis; of allocatingto the landward areas and. small burghs,  out of.the amount appor-.tioned to the county,, grants calculated mainly on a capitation.basis,the county council receiving the balance.  Tn effect,  the landwardareas and small burghs share in that  balance in: proportion torateable value.Scope of investigation.   5. The scope  of the investigation as defined in Section  72 is the examination of the method of distribution of grant, by reference toweighted  population,  to the counties and large burghs  and theinternal distribution of grant within the counties.   6. The Rules for calculating the weighted populations of counties and large burghs are containeed in Part III of the Seventh Scheduleto the Local Government  (Scotland) Act, 1929  (see paragraphs 28and 29 of cmd.. 3135 in Appendix II) and  provide that for each fixedgrant  period  the  weighted  population  shall  be  calculated  by&quot;weighting&quot;  the population of the  area  in  the last year of theprevious grant period by reference to certain factors, namely, thenumber of children under five,  rateable value per head of popula-tion,  the unemployment among insured persons and, in counties,the population per mile of roads.   As explained in Cmd. 3135-1928the intention was that the apportionment should be based on generalcharacteristics independent of actual expenditure, and the factorsselected were  designed so to adjust the distribution as to make theassistance  vary with the need for local government services in any area in relation to the ability of the area  to meet the cost.   7. In making the investigation it  was necessary to  bear in mind that during the period following the introduction of the Act of 192!)considerable changes have taken place, e.g. a  grave increase in thevolume of unemployment followed  by  a  progressive decrease;a decline  in the birth rate and consequently  in the  population ofchildren  under five; increases  and  decreases  in rateable values;a revival of industry in several areas but a continuance of industrialdepression in others.   During this period also the responsibility forthe assistance of the able-bodied unemployed has been assumed bythe Government,  and  agricultural  workers  have  been  brought within the scheme of unemployment  insurance.   Moreover, as from 1st April, 1937, the Ministry of Transport will take over from thecounty councils the trunk roads.
   8. In order to examine the working of the rules contained in the seventh Schedule of the Act  and to consider what changes, if any,were advisable in  the  formula  for  weighted population  it wasnecessary  to  have  regard to the weighted populations and thedistribution of grants in the first and second grant periods and theprobable position in the third grant period if the formula remained unchanged.  Particulars relating to the first and second fixed grantperiods  together  with the  statistical information referred to inparagraph 3 were made available to the representatives of localauthorities in the investigation.Other relevant matters.   9.  In addition, it was necessary to consider other matters affectingthe block grant and its distribution, in particular :         (a)  merging in the block grant the whole of the contributions     payable by local authorities under Section 45 of the Unemploy-     ment Act,  1934;        (6)  adjustment of the block grant as a consequence of the     transfer  of maintenance of certain  trunk roads from county     councils to the Ministry of Transport;        (c)  the extent to which the provisions governing the calcu-     lation  of Additional Exchequer Grants (see paragraph  32 of     Cmd. 3135 in Appendix II) require revision by reason of the     above-mentioned and other changes.    In regard to (a)  it was announced in a Debate on 21st July, 1936, on the subject of the Unemployment Assistance Regulations that consideration was being given to the  merging of these contributions in the block grant as from 1st April, 1937,  by reduction in  the General Exchequer Contributions.    The normal  amount of the unemployment contributions in Scotland is approximately  756,000.   In the third fixed grant period commencing on the 16th May, 1937, the minimum addition of new Exchequer money in Scotland under the existing law, if the payment of unemployment contributions  were continued, was estimated at about  500,000.  If therefore the unemployment contributions were set against the new money, the General Exchequer Contribution in the third  fixed grant period in Scotland, instead  of being increased, would have  been reduced, as compared with the second fixed grant period, by  256,000.  Examination of this position clearly showed that a  satisfactory solution of the  problem  of the poorer  areas could not be reached by any allocation on this basis.  Consideration was then  given to an adjustment on account of  the unemployment contributions  based on weighted populations.   On  this basis  the General  Exchequer Contribution instead of  being decreased by  256,000 would be increased by  60,000; and in July last a statement was issued for the  consideration of the Associations showing what     o  15944                                                 B
the distribution of the grant would be on the basis of  60,000 newmoney if the present formula provisions were unaltered. &apos;   In regard to (6) it was stated in paragraph 10 of the  Financialand  Explanatory  Memorandum  on the Trunk Roads Bill  that itwas  not proposed to require  any specific contributions from localauthorities, to  future works on  the  transferred  trunk roads,  butthat regard would be had to the transfer in negotiations which were proceeding as to the.General  Exchequer Contribution for the nextfixed grant period.   The County Councils&apos; share of the cost of maintenance  of the trunk  roads transferred  is  estimated at  approximately  90,000.The  set-off against this relief would be  a reduction  in the GeneralExchequer Contribution of not less than  22,500.Wider Survey.   10. Although a distribution&apos;  according to the existing formula,as shown in  the July statement referred to in paragraph 9 above would  obviously not ha.ve been unfavourable to a number of localauthorities, the reliefs which it would have afforded to necessitousareas even  after  taking  into account the transfer  of trunk roadswould  have  been comparatively small.  Various  modifications ofthe formula were considered in order to meet the needs of the indus-trial areas in which unemployment is high and of the more sparsely populated districts including the Highlands  and Islands.  It was found, however, that, owing to the limited number  of prosperousareas,  substantial assistance to  the industrial  areas  with high unemployment and the more sparsely populated districts could not begiven without involving hardship to the remainder of the  country.Revision of  the formula.   11. During the course of the investigation the  desirability ofadditional index figures of  need  such as the  number of persons inreceipt of out-relief was considered.  It was found that any necessary adjustment could best be effected by a variation of the existingweighting factors, namely children under five, rateable  value per head of population,  percentage of insured  unemployed and, in thecase of counties,  sparsity  of population.  Examination of the effectof these factors showed that the most satisfactory factor for additionalweighting common to both  burghs and counties was the unemployment factor.   It was decided  on further examination  that increases  in theweighting for unemployment should be  accompanied by some increase in the weighting for sparsity in order to afford extra  assistanceto landward areas and  small burghs.  It is  proposed to  do thispartly by alteration of the sparsity factor itself and partly  by applying it  to population weighted for unemployment,  as well as  for
children and rateable value only, as had previously been the easelThe strengthening of the  sparsity factor is designed&apos; to safeguard the position of the counties generally and to improve the-position ofthe depressed industrial counties and the more sparsely populated areas such as the Highlands and Islands.  At the  same time, by making  the sparsity weighting dependent to some extent on theunemployment figure, it is secured  that the increased weight  now given to the sparsity factor to balance the increase in the Unemploy-ment factor will decline as unemployment decreases.   12. The precise details  of the amendments to.be made in theformula  are shewn  in Appendix  III; and the estimated weightedpopulations of  the counties  and large  burghs for the third fixederrant period on the basis of the revised  formula are given in Appendix IV.                        ,                    &quot;     ::Amount of General Exchequer Contribution.   13. For the reasons given in  paragraph 10, however, revision ofthe formula alone was found to be quite insufficient.  To meet theneeds of the industrial areas with high  unemployment and of themore sparsely populated areas, including the Highlands and Islands,it was  clear that in addition to the alterations in the formula asubstantial increase in the  General Exchequer Contribution would berequired.  Detailed calculations  on the basis of the revised formulashowed  that in order to  make a satisfactory scheme adequate  tothe needs of those areas the new Exchequer money would requireto be increased from  80,000 to  600,000.   Furthermore,  the un-employment contributions, amounting to  756,000, would have to be completely discontinued;  and the relief to County Councils throughthe transfer of trunk roads amounting to  90,000 would not have tohe offset by any reduction in the grant.  The general effect of theseproposals would be  to give the necessitous areas in Scotland financialassistance broadly equivalent to what they would  have received ifthey had been in.England, although the  expenditures which attract the General Exchequer Contribution are in Scotland substantially less.Financial results of wider survey and effect on necessitous areas.   14.  The financial results of the adoption of these recommenda-tions are shown in Appendix V to this Report.   These results  havebeen estimated on  data as  yet  incomplete and  must therefore  beregarded as subject to revision, but they give generally a fair estimateof what would be the new position.   They show  that the combined effect of the increase in the General Exchequer Contribution, the alteration  of the formula,  the discontinuance  of the unemploymentcontributions and the  transfer of trunk roads would be to affordadditional assistance to the necessitous areas, including the highlands and Islands, amounting to  over a million pounds a year, representing

In  all the circumstances  the Government  have agreed  toadopt the  foregoing proposals, and provision will be made accord-ingly in the new Bill.  Necessary provision  will  be included forrevising  the relation of the General Exchequer Grant to rate andgrant borne  expenditure in the third fixed grant  period, and forconsequential alterations in the method of calculating  AdditionalExchequer Grants.Distribution within Counties.    16. For the  purpose of the investigation into  the distributionof grant within  the  Counties full  particulars of the calculation anddistribution of grants to landward areas and small burghs  in thefirst and second grant periods were furnished to the Associationsby the Department.,  While, it has been represented on behalf  ofparticular  areas  that  certain inequalities result  from the presentmethod of internal distribution, no specific proposals for amendmenthave  been  made by the Associations, and it  did not appear thatany alterations in the method of internal distribution would produceover 70 per cent, of the total  additional assistance afforded to! localauthorities generally.                                &apos;     &apos;   1   Instances of such gains are:-.                       :     :;.-ri;   ,     .; ....  ,                 1            &apos; Equivalent rate
results which would be regarded as on the whole more satisfactorythan the present system.  In  the&apos;circumstances  the Secretary  ofState does not consider that amendment of the rules for the distribu-tion. of the grants  to landward areas arid small burghs  would bejustified at fhe  present  time,  but the question might be furtherreviewed in the light of the operation of the revised formula beforethe end of the third fixed grant period.  The county apportionmentwill be increased under the proposals referred to in the  preceding paragraphs, and this will have the  effect of increasing the: capitationgrantsdn the case of both.landward areas and small burghs.                        OTHER MATTERS.                  &apos;Additional Exchequer Grants, Section 57.   17.  These grants were  provided in the  Act of  1929  to  ensure to each county  and large  burgh a minimum gain of Is. per headover what is termed its &quot; standard sum.&quot;  This standard sum  is,in effect, the amount of the income lost to the area by reason  ofderating and the withdrawal of the percentage and other  grants which were discontinued by  the Act.  If the needs of the area  as determined by its weighted population decrease, the standard sumis scaled down in proportion and the Is.  per head gain is calculated on the reduced  figure.   In view  of the proposed  revised formula for calculating weighted population the Bill will make it clear that,for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent, if any, the standardsum  shall be  scaled  down,  the weighted population  of the firstgrant period shall be calculated as if the revised formula had then been operative.Compensation for losses on account  of special rates (Section  59), &amp;c.   18.  Section 59 (1)  (b) of the Act provides that a sum equal  to25 per  cent, of the  loss on account of special rates (as determined under the Act) in any landward area shall be allocated to that area by the  county council out of the General and Additional exchequer grants during the  first and  second fixed grant periods,  and that thereafter the sum shall be such as the county council may determine.It is proposed that the Section be amended so that the sum so to bepaid during the  third fixed grant  period shall not be less than thesum jJayable in the second period.Provision for further statutory investigation.   19.  The Associations generally  are of the opinion that in view  ofthe economic conditions at present existing in some areas which theproposed  alterations in the formula are largely designed to meet and the prospect of substantial improvement in those areas, it  isadvisable that the block grant formula should again be reviewed.
   The Secretary of State has considered the matter and he is ofopinion that it would be reasonable to provide for a further statutoryinvestigation  before  the  whole  of  the General Exchequer Contri-bution  is  distributed  on the  basis  of the formula for weightedpopulation, i.e.  at the end of the  third  or  the  fourth  fixed grantperiod as may be determined..  .Co-operation of  local authorities.    20.  In submitting to Parliament the result of this investigation,with which the representatives of each of the Associations of localauthorities  have indicated their general  satisfaction, the Secretaryof State wishes  to express his appreciation of their support, and toplace on record that the investigation has been  thorough in all its aspects and that the part taken in it by the representative bodies ofthe local authorities has been of the greatest  value.

The  Government  have come to  the conclusion  that the  necessaryaccompaniments of the  derating scheme  are (a) some  modification of thebasis and method of Government contribution to local services; (6) arrange -ments to meet the case  of the  necessitous areas;  and  (c) arrangements  to obviate the difficulties of those authorities whose finances are on too narrowa basis.  If the case of necessitous areas  is to be met,  a new method  of distribution of  Government  grants  and  reorganisation  of administrative arrangements  are both requisite.   23. The Government  .  .   .  have considered how  the principles whichshould regulate  a proper system of Exchequer  grants  can be applied and,in their view, such a system should          (i) recognise that a fair contribution  should be made  from  the      Exchequer towards the cost of local services ;         (ii) ensure that local authorities  have  complete  financial  interest      in their administration;         (iii) be adapted in its working to the needs of the areas;         (iv) permit  the  greatest  freedom of local  administration  and      initiative;         (v) provide  for  sufficient general control  and  advice  from  the      Central  Departments  to  ensure  a  reasonable  standard of efficiency      in administration. Amount of the Grant.    26. The total  sum to be  distributed as the  new grant-in-aicl  of.revenue for the first quinquennial period will be made up of..         (i) The estimated loss of rates due to derating which would have      been incurred by  all local  authorities in the year  1928-29  1 (taken  for      the purposes of the scheme as &quot; the standard year &quot;) on the assumption      that the proposed local government  changes had been in operation in
     that year, and that the Valuation Roll* in force on the 1st October,     1929, had been in force in that year.        (ii) The assigned revenue and local taxation licence grants payable     for the standard year other than  the grants  specifically  applied to     education and police services.        (iii) The Agricultural Rates Grants payable for the standard year.        (iv) The Health Percentage Grants payable for the standard year.        (v) The classification grants for Class I and Class II roads in large   &apos;.; -burghs and the  maintenance  grants for scheduled roads &apos; in county     districts payable for the standard year.&apos;   &apos;   &apos;            &apos;       !:        (vi) An&quot; additional slam of new money which for purposes of illustra-     tion has been taken as  750,000 for Scotland.Apportionment of Grant among Counties and Large  Burghs.   27.  It  is proposed that the  whole of the new  Exchequer grant-in-aid should in  the first  place  be apportioned among counties and large burghs,this apportionment being ultimately according to a formula based on generalcharacteristics  independent  of  actual  expenditure.  In   deciding  whatcharacteristics should be adopted, and what weight should be given to each,the aim has been so to adjust the distribution of this  new revenue as to makethe assistance  vary with the  need  for local government  services in  any area in relation to  the ability of the area to meet  the cost.  After  careftilexamination of a wide range of possible factors a combination of population,the proportion to  the total population of children under five years of age,and the rateable value per  head of population has been taken as  the mainframework of the formula.   To  these factors  of  general  application  have been  added two furtherfactors of a special character, the  one to allow for the additional burdenthrown upon certain areas  by abnormal unemployment, and the  other forthe considerable variations  in  the cost of certain local government servicesarising in  counties from the differing density of the population.  .  .   28. These factors are combined  in the proposed  formula so as to  arriveat a &quot;  weighted population&quot; for each administrative county and large burghand when the scheme is in full operation the total sum available will be apportioned among the  administrative comities and large burghs  on thebasis of weighted population.   Owing, however, to the very irregular distribution of the existing revenuesto be replaced by the formula grant, it is considered that too great a disturbancein local finance would be caused by  introducing a complete allocation on this basis at one step.  It is accordingly  proposed during the first fifteen yearsof the  scheme, to base the grant allotted to administrative counties and large burghs partly on the present distribution of these revenues and partly on theformula..   Eor  the first quinquennial periodf the fixed annual grant will bemade up  of two parts.  The first part will be equivalent to 75 per cent,  ofthe loss of rates and grants in the standard year .......  the second part,which  in total will comprise the equivalent of 25 per cent, of the loss of rates   * This  expression  as used throughout the  Memorandum means  the valuation Roll in force  at  1st October,  1929, subject to such adjustments of the  valuations therein contained as may be necessary to give effect tothe derating scheme for  a whole year.                     ....   j In the Bill  as  eventually passed it  was provided that instead of eachgrant period being for five years, the first two grant periods should be ofthree and four years respectively, subsequent,periods being five years.
                                   mand! grants and the whole of the new Exchequer money, together roughlyone-third of the whole grant, will be distributed according  to  the formula.On each subsequent revision it is  proposed that more and more of the totalgrant should.be distributed  on formula until by 1945 the.whole would be distributed entirely on this basis.    29. The full formula proposed  is as follows :          (1) For  each county  and large burgh a figure&apos; of  &quot;weighted     population &quot;  is  arrived,  at  by increasing the  population  in the     standard year as estimated by the Registrar-General.         (a) by the percentage by which, at the last previous  Census, the           number of children under 5 years of age per 1,000 of the population           of the area exceeded 50; and                      ...   -        (6) by the percentage by which, according to the Valuation Roll           in force on the  1st October,  1929 (or, on subsequent revisions           of the  grant, in the  year prior  to the  revisions),  the  rateable           value  per head  of  estimated population of the area is below            12 10s. *               In the case of the  counties,  the  population  so  increased is           weighted by two further factors  and in the ease  of  large burghs,           by the first of these factors.                         -   &apos;  -!-        (c) for vxnemployment: the number of unemployed  insured mentis           expressed  as  a percentage of total  estimated population, and           where this percentage,  averaged over 3 years,  exceeds Ii per           cent.,  the  population as  increased  by  (a) and (6) is  further           increased  by  a percentage equal to  ten times the  excess &quot;over            I J per  cent.        (rf) for low density of population; where the estimated population           per mile of roads is  less than  100  persons the population as           increased by  (a) and  (6) is further increased by  the percentage           by which the estimated  population  per mile of roads is less           than 200  persons:  and  where..the  estimated  population per           mile of roads is  100 persons  or  more, by the percentage which           50 persons bears to the estimated population per mile of roads.         (2) The  total amount of the formula grant allotted to each  large     burgh and to  each  administrative  county  will be x pence multiplied     by its  weighted population.   (The money factor  x  pence   will,,be     determined by  the  total  sum available for distribution .in Scotland     on the formula basis.)......Distribution to Small Burghs and  Landward Area of  County.    30. Out  of the total amount allotted to each administrative  countya grant will, be made  to  each small burgh at a  uniform figure per head ofactual  population and to the landward  area of the county at two-thirds of the uniform figure per head of  actual population.  The  uniform figurewill be one-half the amount  ascertained by dividing  the total grant allotted to  all  administrative  counties by the aggregate  actual population of the   *  The average  rental per head of population in Scotland is about. 25per cent,  higher than the corresponding rental in England.    12 10s.  has there fore been taken as the equivalent of the  10 rental adopted for purposesof the scheme in England.   f  In the Bill as eventually passed, it was  provided that  to the numberof unemployed insured men there should be-  added  10 per cent,  of  thenumber of unemployed insured women.
                                   15counties.  The aggregate of the grants (1) paid to the small burghs and(2)  allocated to the landward area will then be deducted from the  grantappropriate to the administrative county as a whole and the balance will bethe grant available to the county council in aid of the general county rate tobe levied over the whole area; of the county (i.e., the landward area and thesmall burghs).   The foregoing proposals  in regard to the distribution of the grant within each administrative  county have been framed with special reference to thevery considerable changes in the incidence of rates within the county involvedin the transfer of poor law, public health and  certain highways to the countycouncils.Additional and Supplementary Exchequer Grants.   32. It is also proposed that, in the case of any large burgh or administrativecomity  (as a whole) in  which the allotted grant in.aid does not exceed theaggregate loss of rates and grants in the standard year by a sum equivalentto Is. per head of actual population  of the area, the allotted grant shall beincreased by such a sum as will bring the  net gain up to the equivalent ofIs. per head of the population.   As   regards  the  small  burghs  and   landward  parishes within  theadministrative  county  it  would,  in  view of  the wide variation  in  thepresent poundage of rates  in any  one county, be impossible to guarantee that in every area there should be a decrease of rates  consequent on theintroduction of  the  scheme.  Clearly, with equalisation of certain  chargesthroughout the county  some areas will gain and  others  will lose, but itis desired to spread the full financial effect  of the scheme over as long aperiod as possible.  It is,  therefore,  proposed that if  the calculated ratepoundage in the standard  year in any  burgh or parish shows an increaseresulting from the scheme to the  burgh or parish  a separate  Special grant should be given of the  money equivalent of that increase.  One-half of the separate Special Grant  in  each  county will be  found by the Exchequerand the other half  will be chargeable by the county  council against thesmall burghs and parishes in the county in which the calculated rate poundagein the standard  year shows a reduction resulting from the scheme.   Theamount  so  charged will  be proportional to  the money equivalent of  therate reductions  in the particular burghs and parishes.   The  Special grant and the special  charges  against the  burghs and  parishes referred  to willbe  reduced by  one-fifteenth  each year.   In this way while certain  areas will  receive  a substantial  relief from the outset  no area will suffer anincrease of rate poundage  by reason of  the scheme  when it  conies intooperation and  the  necessary adjustments  will  be  spread gradually over aperiod of fifteen years.

It is provided that in the first and second fixedgrant periods this excess percentage over  li shall be  multiplied by 10, and.that in the third and successive periods the multiple of 10 shall be reduced in proportion as the  distribution  of the General  Exchequer  Contribution isbased increasingly on the formula instead of on losses of rates  and grants.The  object of this provision was to ensure  that at the  outset as much money should be distributed on the unemployment factor  as would have been  thecase if the whole of the  General Exchequer Contribution had been allocatedon the formula.   In the  third fixed grant period the multiple of 10 would, inaccordance with that provision, have  been reduced to a little under  6.   Inview, however, of the continued unemployment in some areas  it was con-sidered that the multiple should be retained at 10 and that further to assistsuch areas a &quot; superweighting &quot; should be introduced where the percentageof unemployed exceeds 5 per cent, of the population.   The alterations in the sparsity factor  are dealt with in para. 11  of  theReport.
