Estimated Cost of our Recommendations.                             (A) INTRODUCTION.Terms of Reference, &amp;c.    1.  WE were appointed on  the  2nd  December,  1936  (Cabinet 69  (36),Conclusion 7), to investigate the problems of Army Recruiting in the light of thefollowing papers :          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 322 (36)),         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (CP. 323 (36)),         Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. 327 (36) ),and in the light of the Cabinet discussion itself.    Our composition was laid down as follows :          The First Commissioner of Works (in the Chair),         The Chancellor of the Exchequer,         The Secretary of State for War,         The Secretary of State for Air,         The Secretary of State for India,         The First Lord of the Admiralty,         The Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence,         The Minister of Health,         The Minister of Labour.Recruiting Deficits, actual and prospective.     2.   The problem is to bridge the gap between the authorised establishment ofthe Regular Army* and its existing actual strength.   That gap was              On April 1, 1934    .........-  ...      3,742             On April 1, 1936............     10,074    * We  are not  dealing with the recruiting problems of the Territorial Army. While thestrength of &quot;other ranks &quot; in that Army was on 1st January, 1937, some  52,800 below establish-ment, a great improvement in  recruiting, amounting to about 77  per cent., has resulted fromthe concessions granted last year.
    The figures  which  follow are  estimates  of the  probable  gaps  betweenestablishment and strength in 1938 and 1940, on the assumption that recruitingdoes not deteriorate further :-    1938   ...    20,300    This would mean that it would  only be possible  to                                provide drafts for  overseas by reducing  home                                units to cadre.    1940   ...    31,000    This would  mean  that  it  would be impossible  to                                provide drafts-or, in other words, to garrison                                the Empire.    If the present practice of &apos;&apos; holding &apos;&apos;  men for an extra year is abandoned(see paragraph 10) without a corresponding increase  in  recruits, these figures would rise to 25,100 in 1938 and  35,800  in  1940.  But it  is hoped  that therecommendation in paragraph 10 will result in a more than compensatory increasein recruits.    The authorised establishment, so far as infantry is concerned, is smaller by22 battalions than in 1914.    A  striking feature is  the existing  excess of overseas over home service.Owing to the recent temporary necessity of strengthening the  garrisons in egypt and Palestine, this excess rose at one time to 46 battalions, 86 being abroad and40 at home.  On the 1st January, 1937, the numbers were 72 abroad and  54  athome, but there is still an abnormal number of battalions in Palestine.  army estimates for 1936 showed as the normal 65 battalions abroad and 61 at home.&apos;The excess of  service abroad is undoubtedly one of  the principal causes of unsatisfactory recruiting.General Remarks.    3.  The problem is formidable, and it may be that it will prove to be insolubleby voluntary means.  On the other  hand, His Majesty&apos;s  Governments pledgesput any form of conscription outside the sphere of  practical politics.  In any event, it would be difficult to justify  conscription,  which would be extremelyunpopular, until every possible method of making the voluntary system effectivehad been tried, especially since conscription would not solve the peace-timeproblem of maintaining overseas garrisons.    It seems  to us essential that such of our recommendations as the Cabinet mayapprove should be put into effect at one and the same time.  Our recommendationstouch on the problem from a variety of directions, and in more normal times  their application might reasonably have been spread over a period of years.  In presentcircumstances,  however,  nothing  short of action  on a  large scale  will attractattention  or  stimulate enlistments.   We wish  to  emphasise  this  point at the outset.    We propose to reserve our estimates of the cost of  our various recommenda-tions for combined presentation in the Appendix to this  Report.                      (B) PRE-ENLISTMENT PROPOSALS.Publicity.    4.  We are convinced of the necessity for the fullest use of modern publicitymethods.    A publicity bureau for recruiting has already been established in the WarOffice, and a paid advertising agency with the services of experienced journalistshas been employed.  In  our view this is not  enough.   It is important to distinguish publicity from advertising.  The central control of publicity should in future be in the hands of a highly-qualified Public Relations Officer, who shouldbe able at very little cost to obtain the co-operation Of a variety  of  interests,e.g., the  publicity organisations of  the country, leading business men, &amp;c.   Thevarious interests should be represented on an advisory committee.    In this connection we consider that adequate publicity  should be given to thefact that the total emoluments of the soldier consist partly  of his pay and partly of allowances;  such as clothing allowance,  which is specifically allotted to themaintenance of his  uniform.
sModernisation of the Recruiting System.    5.  The existing recruiting offices often present a lifeless appearance, andthe actual accommodation is often indifferent.  In our view, a better impressioncould be produced on  the  potential recruit by a  process of  unification and modernisation.   We see no valid reason why the three Services should maintainseparate recruiting offices in the same town, and we  suggest that in such cases a combined recruiting office, dealing with all three Services, should be set up.    In fairness, however, to the Service Departments, it should be said that theydo not welcome the idea of combined recruiting offices, which they consider wouldgive rise to administrative difficulties.   The War Office also are not sanguine asto the benefit to recruiting  for the Army which is  likely to be achieved by theproposal.    We  recommend that  an experimental  test of unified  recruiting in  oneprovincial area should take place and that the extension of  the scheme should beconsidered in the light of that experiment.Employment Exchanges and Ministry of Labour Centres.    6.  It is hardly necessary to say that Employment Exchanges are already authorised to give recruiting information to  any men who ask for it.  Arrange-ments have been made in  collaboration with  the Service Departments  for improving the  display  of recruiting posters at  the Exchanges.   The question arises whether  it is desirable, in addition, to instruct the  Exchange officials touse their discretion in suggesting to suitable unemployed men the possibility of joining the Army.    We may say, without developing in detail the objections to this suggestion,that considerable confusion might result;  this might well impair the efficiency ofthe Employment Exchange machinery, on which the  country is mainly dependentfor the  supply of workers for the Defence Requirements programme.    One difficulty would be that service in the Defence Forces is not technically a&quot;suitable&quot; job; there would  thus be  no power to suspend benefit if  a manrefused to enlist.  To take such power  would be to introduce conscription by aback  door, a method which would be politically inconceivable.  It would  follow,therefore, that service in the Forces would be on the level  of an  &quot; unsuitable &apos;&apos;job, so far as benefit is concerned.  We consider that it would be most unfortunate that  the  Defence  Services  should come to be  considered  as  &apos;&apos; unsuitable &apos;&apos;employment.   The  practical result  would be that the unemployed would soonrealise that they need pay no attention  to the Exchange officials&apos;  suggestion.    The Secretary of State for War does not  press the proposal;  he is inclined tothink that it might probably make little difference to recruiting.    We take a similar view in not recommending the suggestion that recruitingofficers  should  be entitled to enter the  Ministry of Labour&apos;s Instructional andTraining Centres.         (C) PROPOSALS AFFECTING THE  PERIOD OF  COLOUR  SERVICE.The Soldier&apos;s Pay.    7.  The Secretary of State for War does not ask for any increase in the soldier&apos;s pay.  He states that he would regard this as the very last resort, short of conscription.  The fact that a similar increase in the pay of the other defence services would necessarily follow indicates the heavy cost of any such proposal.Reduction of the  Tour Overseas.    8.  Experience  shows  that  among  the  most  important  causes  of  the unwillingness  of  the youth of the nation to  join the Army is  the long  touroverseas.  This is normally a tour of some 5 or 6 years, served more often  thannot in India, a country which has unfortunately become the most unpopular scene of military service.  To  remove this cause of dissatisfaction and to provide  alively encouragement to recruiting the most desirable proposal, and the  ideal towhich the Army  Council consider that efforts should ultimately be directed, isthat the soldier should not be called upon  in the normal course to spend a periodof more than 4 years overseas.
    Unfortunately, however, a 4 years tour overseas cannot be operated with theArmy  at  its present actual  strength.  If therefore  our other proposals, taken together with a reduction in the overseas tour, failed to produce recruits  to anumber considerably in excess of what is required under existing conditions theshortage  in  establishments  would become more serious  than ever.   We  fearaccordingly that we cannot recommend the proposal as an immediately practicablemeasure.    Different considerations arise in the case of the overseas  tour of Air force personnel (see paragraph 26).Reduction of Colour Service.    9.  Another serious deterrent to recruiting is the 7 years Colour Service inthe infantry of the line which strikes a potential recruit of 19 as the  surrender of an unreasonably large slice of his lifetime.  This is borne out by the ease withwhich  recruits are found  for a  4 years Colour Service with  the  Foot Guards,although  the fact that this service is normally spent entirely at home must be reckoned as a contributory factor.    We should have wished to  propose an alteration in  the terms of  service inthe infantry to 6 years with the Colours and 6 years in the Reserve.   We must point out, however, that the effect of reducing the period of Colour Service from years to 6, assuming no increase  of recruiting,  would be to reduce the totalnumber of  effectives  with the  Colours  by a  considerable  number.  &quot;We  feeldoubtful whether the inducement of 1 year&apos;s less service with the Colours would produce the countervailing increase  in the number of recruits  necessary to offsetthis reduction.  We find ourselves, therefore,  compelled  to  take  a pessimisticview of the risks involved  in the introduction of a 6 years&apos; engagement, and wecannot in present circumstances recommend it.The Abolition of &quot; Holding.&quot;    10.  The dissatisfaction with  the 7-year period of  Colour Service is even further increased by  the  fact  that  under present  arrangements  it  is  usuallynecessary to  &apos;&apos; hold &apos;&apos;  a British soldier in India (and at other stations abroad)for an additional period, after the expiration of his 7 years&apos; service.  The result is that his Colour Service  is extended possibly to 8 years,  instead of the 7 years for which he covenanted as a recruit.    Failing any  fundamental change in the conditions  of service, the first andobvious step to take towards  shortening the duration  of the tour overseas, and sostimulating recruiting, is to  abolish &quot;holding.&quot;  This  will involve India goingshort of about 9,000 men for the time being, but the Government of India haveagreed  to  consider facing this  shortage.   It will also  involve  a shortage ingarrisons  abroad other than India,  amounting in all  to some 4,000 men.    The Secretary of State for  India has concurred, on the understanding that,as soon as the increase in the number of recruits permits, steps will be taken tomake  good the shortage in the Indian Establishment.    In the event of an emergency arising during the time of the shortage, india will no longer be able to obtain the necessary reinforcements for the first 6 monthsof war by drawing on  internal security units.   The Secretary of State  for Indiadoes not ask for a rigid guarantee that reinforcements will be forthcoming from home;  he recognises that the action to be taken in an emergency must be governed by the  requirements of the Empire as a whole.   He assumes, however, that it willnot be questioned that, in return for the Government of  India&apos;s willingness totake the risk of going short of their accepted establishment, the Home Governmentwill be under a special obligation to come to their help if the need arises.    We recommend the abolition of &quot; holding,&quot; which in present circumstances will entail India and other stations  abroad  going  short of  establishment  forthe time being.   The financial effect of this proposal is shown in the Appendix.Suggested Deliberate Reduction of Battalion Establishments in India.    11.  Unless there  were an immediate rise in the number of recruits, the threeschemes discussed in the preceding paragraphs, viz., reduction of tour overseas,reduction of Colour Service and abolition of &quot; holding,&quot; would each (if approved)involve a  temporary reduction in British battalion establishments  in India  and elsewhere.    The separate suggestion has been made that the shortage of soldiers mightbe met by a deliberate reduction in British battalion  establishments abroad, as a
permanent measure.  We  cannot recommend  this.  The  maintenance  of theBritish battalions in India at their existing establishments is one of the funda-mental assumptions of the new Indian Constitution.Completion at home of the last months of Colour Service.     12.  Whatever may be the decision regarding the period of Colour Service,or the length of the tour overseas, it is most desirable that a man should return home with some  months  of unexpired service,  thus  removing  the presentgrievance  that  soldiers  are  thrown  at  once on  the labour market on  their return to  the United  Kingdom,  when  home  connections have  been lost.   we appreciate, however, that it may be difficult to achieve this end within the narrowlimits imposed even by a restricted tour of 4 years overseas.  The difficulty would,of course, be accentuated if the period of  Colour Service were  reduced from 7 to 6years.     We  consider that  a  14 days&apos; furlough is insufficient to  enable men to lookround for employment and make arrangements for their return to civil life.  Wetherefore recommend that  those who are not admitted to Vocational training establishments should be  given the option of extending their  service for varyingperiods, up to a maximum of  3 months,  in this country.     The present system bears particularly hardly on men who have been &quot; held,&quot;since in the normal course they are due for discharge immediately on their return home, after 14 days&apos; furlough.     We  recommend that the option to which we have referred should be offered,in the interim period during  which &apos;&apos; holding &apos;&apos;  is coming to  an end, to &apos;&apos; held &apos;&apos;men as well as to men  returning in the ordinary course.    * It is difficult to estimate  the cost of this concession, but we  do not anticipate that it would exceed  175,000 in 1937-38,  150,000 in 1938-39 and  100,000  in subsequent years.  The question of incidence might require consideration.&quot; Limited payment &quot; furlough.     13.   The 4 years&apos; overseas tour being ruled out at present, it is necessaryto consider the  proposal to grant &quot;limited payment&quot; furlough after 3  years&apos;service abroad.  This proposal presents grave difficulties from the point of viewof India, since,  apart from the increased cost involved, it would mean a furthershortage  in India, in  addition  to  that  resulting for the  time being from theabolition of  &quot; holding.&quot;   In these  circumstances  we do not recommend theproposal.Proposed expatriation payment.     14.   The Memorandum   by  the  Secretary  of State for  War contains aproposal  for an additional payment of Qd. a  day to all other ranks serving abroad, at an estimate cost of  272,000  to this country and   513,000 to  India.The Secretary  of  State,  however, does not desire to press the proposal at thepresent time,  in view  of  the  large expenditure which it would impose on theGovernment of India.     We consider that  the abolition of &quot; holding,&quot; if approved, will be a more effective inducement to enlistment than the suggested expatriation payment.Uniform, &amp;c.     15.   The proposal in the Memorandum by  the Secretary of State for Waris that the whole  of the Army, both Regular and Territorial,  should be  givenblue uniform, both for ceremonial occasions and for walking out.  The additional cost  of the proposal to  this  country is estimated in the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum at  130,000 per annum, with a capital expenditure of  630,000in the first year.  In the case of India the figures given are  13,000 and  150,000.     The  Secretary of  State&apos;s Memorandum is earlier in date than the cabinet meeting of the 28th October, 1936.  At that Meeting the question of  blue uniformwas considered as  a special measure in  connection with the Coronation and  itwas agreed :     &apos;&apos; (a) To approve the  proposal of  the Chancellor of the Exchequer  that the           Army  Council  should have  authority  to  purchase and  issue  blue           uniforms to troops taking part in the Coronation ceremony.     (b)  That no  charge should be  involved  to  the  Government of India &quot;           (Cabinet 60 (36) Conclusion 9.)
    The majority of the Committee are of the opinion that no further decisionought to be taken until after the Coronation, which should be a good test of thepopularity of the blue  uniform.  We therefore make no recommendation now  asto the  provision of some other uniform in addition to khaki.    We recommend, however, that the privilege of wearing plain clothes whenout of  barracks should be given as freely as possible to all ranks, subject to therequirements of discipline, and that the similar privilege of  &quot; all night &quot; leaveshould be extended.Stoppages.    16.  A man joining the Army is led to believe that he will receive 2s. a dayclear.  That is not the case, and it seems probable that stoppages from pay are regarded in much the  same light as an offence against the &apos;&apos; Truck &apos;&apos; Act, andthat they are a serious deterrent  to recruiting.   Subject to  the adjustment  of details in the light of conditions in the three Services, we recommend the abolitionof the  stoppages from the pay of recruits for necessary items of clothing andequipment, which are not covered by the existing allowances; and that the total kitallowance in the first year of service should be increased from the present  45s.  to75s., so long as the soldier&apos;s rate remains as at present.    As regards the trained soldier we recommend that the pith  helmet and the extra uniform required  on  proceeding  abroad should be provided from  public funds.Suppers.    17.  We  recommend the  proposal to  provide  suppers  on seven  nightsa week,  subject to the condition that the total cost of the Army ration  (or thecorresponding  allowances)   shall  not   exceed  the   corresponding  costs forthe Navy, in comparable conditions and at comparable prices. We consider thatthe arrangements to provide a corresponding concession for the British  forcesin India should  be settled  in consultation between  the Secretary of State forIndia,  the Secretary of State for War, and the Secretary of  State for Air.Minor Improvements.    18.  The Secretary of State for War  referred  in paragraph 44  of his memorandum to his desire to introduce a number of minor improvements in theconditions of the  Army,  connected particularly with rations,  fuel  and thefurnishing and equipment of messes, &amp;c.  These&quot; proposals, almost all of whichhave reactions on the  Air Force,  and to a less extent on the Navy, have been examined in detail for us by officials of the Service Departments and the Treasury;and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for War haveagreed upon  a  programme which  will  afford substantial improvements.  Theannual cost of the proposed improvements is estimated at  355,000 for the Army,while the consequential cost for the Navy is estimated at  54,000, and for the AirForce  at  185,000.  In addition,  there will  be a moderate capital expenditurespread over five years on Army and Air  Votes.     The following is a list of the items  in regard  to which improvements  will  bemade :          (a) Fuel for cooking, baths, &amp;c.         (b) Butter.         (c) Ration Allowance on Leave. .        id) Ration Allowance when at Duty -               (i) Higher Rate of Ration Allowance,              (ii) Personal  Ration Scale and Allowance,              (iii) Relaxation in conditions  of  issue of Higher Rate.  ,, &apos;     (e) Diet for Boys.         (/) Meal Service Allowance.  * ,..    (g) Other  Messing Improvements.         (h) Cookhouse amenities.         ii)  Dining Room amenities.         (j) -Institute  amenities.         (k) Accommodation on Transports.         (l)  Married Soldiers&apos; Quarters (Furniture).
    The Ministry of Labour have made the suggestion that if butter is provided in the Army it may be necessary to introduce it also in the Ministry&apos;s TrainingCentres.  It is estimated that if this were, in fact, necessary the cost would beabout  5,000 per annum;                       (D) AFTER-CARE PROPOSALS.Civil  Employment: Vocational Training.    19.  On the difficult questions dealt with in this part of our Report we havebeen  greatly assisted by  a Ministerial  Sub-Committee, presided over by. thePostmaster-General.    There can be no doubt that the most effective stimulus to recruiting would bea guarantee to the regular that after his  time in the Porces he would be assured of good, steady employment in civil life.  Such  a guarantee is unfortunately notpossible.   If, however, it  could fairly be stated that the  best  opportunity forengagement in  (say) the Police was by a period of service in  the Regular forces the recruiting question might be on the way to solution.  We understand that thishas, in fact, assisted materially the adequate flow of recruits to the Foot Guards.    The objective  must be to  improve the prospects  of the ex-regular  over thewhole field of suitable civil employment. With this end in view the Army Councildesire to  extend the  facilities for Vocational  Training, so  as  to  enable thattraining be offered free to any  man who wishes for it.    The problem is not a simple one.  An average of approximately 17,500 menpass out of  the Army annually on the expiration of their Colour Service.   Thecore of  the problem,  however,  is estimated at from 10,000 to 12,000 men a year at the present time.  The rest are accounted  for in various ways; in most casesemployment is  either readily  available for them, or may be  expected to become available  after a  course  at  one  of  the existing  Army Vocational  TrainingCentres.    We are impressed  with the  striking success  which vocational training  isachieving at the present time.   We do  not think that  it is as  widely known as itshould be that employment is  actually  being found for about 80 per cent, of theserving soldiers (about 3,000 in number) who pass through the Army centres eachyear,  and for about 98 per cent, of the unemployed men in civil life (about 12,000in number)  who pass through the Ministry of  Labour centres each year.   TheMinistry  of Labour, however, advise  us  that  the  success hitherto obtained  is primarily due to the care with which the number of men offered training is relatedso far as possible to the amount of employment available for such trained men, andthat it cannot safely be assumed that the present favourable circumstances in these respects will continue indefinitely.   Any extension of the Vocational Training of ex-regulars  must be so far  as  possible related to this  factor, and we accordingly recommend  that the  responsibility for all Army Vocational Training should betransferred to the  Ministry of Labour.    The Ministry  of Labour scheme is about to be expanded, so as to deal withsome  16,000 men a year.  We think that, on the eventual absorption of the Armycentres  in the  Ministry of Labour scheme, the combined schemes might have an eventual output in  the next year or two of some 20,000 a year.    Pending the inauguration of  a combined  scheme, the details of which shouldbe worked out by the Departments concerned, we consider that men not fully time-expired should continue to go to the existing Army Vocational Centres, at whichthe fees now charged should be discontinued.  Time-expired sailors, soldiers and airmen  should go to  the centres at Southampton and  Leeds, which the Ministerof Labour has undertaken to reserve for ex-regular personnel.  The annual outputof these two centres is estimated at 1,000  and 1,400 respectively.    The transfer of the scheme to the Ministry of Labour will necessitate thetraining being given  to men  after discharge or transfer to  the  Reserve.Government Employment for Ex-Regulars: Present Position.                -    20.  The  total number of ex-service men  at present employed in a non-industrial capacity in Government  Departments is nearly 175,000, representingabout one-half of  the total staff (approximately 350,000) and about two-thirds of the total male staff (approximately 260,000).    It  is not  possible  to  divide  these  figures of ex-service  men  as  betweenex-regulars and &quot; ex-hostilities &quot; men.  It will readily be understood that, owingto the great expansion of the Defence Forces in the last War, large numbers fall
into the second category.  Indeed, the present favourable showing  is to someextent a temporary phenomenon,  resulting from  the  special arrangements  for recruitment to  Government employment in  the post-war period.  Statistics  arenot available of the numbers of ex-regulars in Government employment at  thepresent  time,  but the   Postmaster-General&apos;s  Sub-Committee  is  obtainingstatistical information of the future annual intake of ex-regulars.    So far as Government industrial staffs  are concerned,  information is not atpresent available showing what proportion of the total of 145,000 are ex-membersof the Forces.    The obstacles  in the way of increasing  the reservation of Government postsfor ex-regulars are serious.  In the first place, there is  the obligation which restsupon  such a Department as the General Post Office,  which  annually takes onits books large numbers of boy messengers, to see that a career  is kept open forthese  entrants.  The Government cannot lay itself open  to  the accusation of encouraging  &quot;blind alley&quot;  employment.  So far as many other suitable fieldsare concerned, reservation to ex-regulars is  the existing practice.    The theoretical reservation to ex-regulars is, however, at the present timematerially affected by  the Government&apos;s pledges to the &quot;ex-hostilities&quot;  men pledges from which it would be unthinkable to attempt to escape, even  for  the sake of the ex-regulars now  leaving the Services.   The Government has  laid it down that applications for employment from ex-soldiers are to  be considered inaccordance with the following definite order of priority:      (a) Ex-regulars  (including  boys)  who  enlisted   on    or  before   the           11th November, 1918.    (b) &quot; Ex-hostilities only &quot; men.    (c) Ex-regulars (including boys) who enlisted after the 11th November, 1918.    We do not recommend any departure from this order of preference.    The &quot; Hostilities only &quot;  complication will solve itself in the course of a  fewyears.   There can be few  such men  who are now less than  37 or 38 years ofage, and in the near future all such men will virtually  be above the age-limit for appointment to posts  of the kind for  which there is a normal reservation to ex-regulars.    It will probably be unwise to draw attention to the fact  that in  some fouryears&apos;  time &quot;ex-hostilities&quot;  men will begin  to be   debarred from enteringGovernment employment by the operation of various age-limits.  The result ofany public statement might well be to  start an agitation for  the widening of thoseage-limits.    Although the  ex-regular will in the near future obtain a greater proportionof the posts which are reserved to him, it  must not be assumed that this will:necessarily benefit men immediately on taking their discharge.   Provided he is within the age limits for appointment, an ex-regular who left the Forces  fifteenor eighteen years  ago is entitled  to  the same consideration as a man recentlydischarged,  and,  in some  cases, on  sympathetic  grounds, may even obtain a preference over a  man recently discharged.   In view  of the fact that a largeproportion of the  vacancies in Government employment are of a permanent orquasi-permanent character, such employment  is eagerly sought after  by  a mannot in steady outside employment.    21.  Since the desire is to provide employment in the Government service formen within a reasonable period of their discharge, it will, in our view, be necessaryto exercise some discrimination against other ex-regulars who, though still  withinthe age-limit for  a particular appointment, terminated their service with  theForces some years previously.  In the case of Post Office appointments, this  endcan probably  be  achieved  by means  of a  quota  arrangement, under which a proportion of the  vacancies would be reserved for newly discharged men.  It isdoubtful if any quota could be introduced for two  or three  years, until  the&quot; ex-hostilities &quot;  men  have passed out of the field of consideration.   Even then the proportion reserved will probably have to be low at first probably not morethan  one-third to begin with.  Over a period of years it might gradually beincreased to two-thirds or three-quarters.   A  somewhat  similar  arrangement might be adopted  in other cases where recruitment is on a large scale or  can becentrally controlled, but in many cases it will not be  possible to do more than
invite Departments to keep in mind the desirability of providing employment forex-regulars within a reasonable period of their discharge.    In the event of any such arrangement being adopted, it would be necessarycarefully to consider what, if any, immediate pronouncement should be made.    The great need for attracting recruits makes it necessary to investigate thepossibility of further extending the present  arrangements in the matter of the reservation of Government employment.    We have invited the Postmaster-.General&apos;s Sub-Committee to continue their examination of the questions dealt with in the present paragraph, and to reporton them to the Cabinet.Questions of pay, pension and seniority affecting Ex-Regidars in the Civil Service.    22.  The Secretary of State for War states in  his Memorandum that one ofthe stumbling-blocks hitherto has been that a man who has served in the  defence forces, and subsequently joins  the  Civil Service, is not permitted to reckon his previous service for purposes of pension.    It is important  to remember, in this connection,  that not all Civil Serviceposts  are pensionable, and that the  unpensionable category includes many of the posts for which ex-regulars are most suitable,  e.g., porters, liftmen, &amp;c.    The  Postmaster-Generals   Sub-Committee  have  not  completed  their examination  of  this  subject.   We have asked them to include in  their Reportrecommendations on  those questions of pay, pension and seniority which affectex-regulars in the  Civil Service.Local Authority Employment for Ex-Regulars.    23.  We find  it necessary to reserve this problem  also for  investigation  andreport by the Postmaster-Generals Sub-Committee.  The Minister of Health has undertaken to give the Sub-Committee all the assistance in his power.Police Employment for Ex-Regulars.    24.  So far as Police Forces are concerned, several conditions  militate againstthe employment of ex-regulars :      (a) The upper age-limit for entry is 25 years in most Forces,  and ex-regulars           are very frequently too old to be eligible.    (b) Police  Forces  are reluctant to accept a high proportion of  men  with           Reserve obligations.    (c)  More severe standards of height and fitness.    We see no  adequate  reason why the  normal method  of recruitment for thePolice should not  be principally through the  Defence Forces, the  upper age-limit for entry being raised for that purpose so as to  cover  the whole  of the  yearbetween  the  twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh birthdays.   The Home Office  andthe Scottish Office have been  asked to examine in  consultation  with chief constables the  possibility of securing a larger number of entries of ex-regularsinto the Police.    We understand  that many Chief  Constables would gladly  take moreex-regulars if they could  be given an assurance that, while they remain reservists,these men will not be called up in the event of a war which threw heavy  internal security  duties on the Police.    It must be pointed out. however, that any major war will undoubtedly require,as in  1914-18, the enlistment of the younger  men from the Police in the  defence forces.   We think that Chief Constables should be instructed to rely on special constables of middle age to undertake internal security duties.    (E)- EFFECT OF  OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ROYAL NAVY  AND ROYAL                                AIR FORCE.Royal Navy.    25.  It will be necessary to consider the effect  on  the Navy of the following-proposals :     (a) Proposal for unified recruiting (paragraph 5).  The Admiralty will have           to be consulted further before any extension of  the present experiment           is undertaken.  The Navy is obtaining all the recruits it needs under           the present system.
    (b)  Minor improvements (paragraph 18).  It will be necessary to estimate the          repercussions of  the suggested improvements.  The only items which          appear to affect  the Navy are (b)  butter and (k)  accommodation on          transports.    (c)  Vocational training  (paragraph 19).  It is now contemplated that regular          Naval personnel  shall be eligible  for admission to the Ministry of          Labour centres, the numbers of  entrants being determined by inter-          Departmental arrangement.  Naval Vocational Training Centres will          still be required  for long-service men.Royal Air Force.    26.   It  will  be  necessary to consider  the effect on the  Air  Force of  thefollowing proposals :      (a)  Proposal for unified recruiting (paragraph 5).   The Air Ministry wish          to reserve their position, for reasons similar to those of the Admiralty.    (b)  Proposals for shortening tour overseas (paragraph 8).  The Air Council          are considering a proposal to introduce a three-year tour in Air Force          overseas commands generally, with a two-year tour  in Iraq and Aden.          The proposal has long been in contemplation, on grounds of Air Force          organisation and of the  contentment  of the men, and has thus arisen          independently of  the  present  proposals  for stimulating  Army          recruiting.   The  Indian command  represents a small part of the Air          Force overseas commitment, and a three-year period of service in India          is already  in force  for a   considerable  majority of-  airmen.   The          adoption  of  a general  three-year tour would  increase the  amount          normally chargeable to India for  transport, &amp;o, of officers and airmen,          but the extra cost to India under this and other heads would probably          not exceed  8,000 a year.    (c)  The recommendations in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 will apply to the Air          Force,  subject to the  detailed consideration of  any special circum-          stances affecting  that Force in these respects.    (d)  Vocational training (paragraph 19).  As in the case  of the Navy, it is          contemplated that regular Air Force personnel  shall be eligible  for          admission to the Ministry of Labour centres, the number of applicants          being  determined by  inter-Departmental  arrangement.           (F) SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS.    27.   Our principal conclusions and recommendations may be summarised asfollows : General.    (a)  We  wish to emphasise tha,t nothing short of action on a large scale is          likely  in  present circumstances to stimulate recruiting.   Whatever          plans  are adopted should therefore be put  into effect at one and  the          same   time.   Piecemeal  application  will  probably  be  useless          (paragraph 3).Pre-Enlistment Proposals.    (b)  The central control of recruiting publicity should be placed in  the hands          of a highly-qualified Public Relations Officer, assisted by an advisory          committee (paragraph 4).    (c)  We  recommend that an experiment of a unified recruiting office for all          three Services be arranged,  and  that  the extension of  the scheme be          considered in the light of that experiment  (paragraph 5).Proposals affecting the period of  Colour Service.    (d)  We regret that the  introduction of a 4 years&apos; overseas tour  and of a          6 years&apos;  period  of  Colour  Service  in  the  infantry is not  an          immediately practicable measure (paragraphs 8 and 9).  As a  first          step, however, towards shortening the duration of the tour overseas,          we recommend the abolition of &quot; holding.&quot;   This  will involve India
           going short of about 9,000 men for the time being, but the Secretary           of  State for India is prepared to accept the  risks involved  (on the           understanding set out in paragraph 10).   If the returning soldier is           not admitted to a Vocational Training establishment, we recommend           that  he be offered  the  option of extending  his service, up  to a           maximum period of 3 months, in this country, in order to give him an           opportunity of regaining touch with home conditions (paragraph 12).    (e) We make no recommendation on the subject of uniform, in view of the           opportunity  of testing  the  popularity of blue uniform  which the           Coronation will  afford.   We recommend,  however,  the  extension of           the privileges of wearing plain clothes when out  of barracks and of           &quot; all night &quot; leave (paragraph 15).    (/) We recommend the abolition of certain stoppages from the pay of recruits           and an increase in the total kit allowance in the first year  of service;           the provision from  public  funds  of the  pith  helmet and  the extra           uniform required by  the   trained soldier on  proceeding  abroad           (paragraph 16); the provision of suppers (paragraph 17); and  various           minor improvements  in the  conditions of  the soldier  (paragraph 18).A fter-Care  Proposals.    (g) The Minister  of  Labour  has  undertaken to reserve for  time-expired           regular sailors, soldiers  and airmen two of his Vocational Training           Centres Southampton,  with an estimated annual  output of 1,000           men,  and Leeds, with an  estimated annual  output of 1,400 men.               We consider that soldiers not fully time-expired should continue           for the time being to go to  the existing  Army Vocational Training           Centres, at which the fees now charged should be remitted.  &apos;               We recommend  the  eventual absorption of the Army  Centres in           the Ministry of Labour scheme (paragraph 19).    (h) Owing to the  operation of various age-limits, &apos;&apos; ex-hostilities &apos;&apos; men will           begin in some 4 years&apos; time to cease to be available for the Government           employment normally reserved for ex-regulars (paragraph 20).               The present  congestion in the waiting-lists  for  Government           employment will,  however, persist for a much  longer period, unless           positive action is taken to discriminate between categories of post-war           ex-regulars.  We recommend a measure of discrimination in favour of           men who have just completed their colour service.   In some Cases the           discrimination might take  the form  of  a quota, under  which  an           increasing  proportion of the vacancies would  be  reserved for newly           discharged men.  In many cases, however, it will not be possible to do      I     more than invite  Departments to keep in mind  the  desirability of      I     providing employment for ex-regulars within a reasonable  period of           their discharge (paragraph 21).    (i) We have invited the Sub-Committee on Government and Local Authority           Employment for  Ex-Regulars  to  continue their examination of the           matters  referred to  at  (h),  of those questions  of pay,  pension and           seniority which affect ex-regulars  in the  Civil Service, and of thei   ...       problems of Local Authority employment for ex-regulars, and to report           to the Cabinet (paragraphs 21, 22 and 23).    (j) We see no adequate reason why the&apos; normal method of  recruitment for the           Police should not be principally through  the  Defence Forces.  The           Home Office  and the Scottish Office have been asked  to examine, in           consultation with Chief Constables, the possibility of securing a larger           number of  entries of ex-regulars into the  Police (paragraph 24).Effect  on Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.    (k) The effect of our proposals on  the Royal  Navy and Royal Air Force is           shown in paragraphs 25 and 26.                                 Signed on behalf of the Committee :                                                 STANHOPE, Chairman.    2  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,           January 14, 1937.
