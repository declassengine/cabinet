THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTSUPPLY OF MUNITIONS  FOR  THE  BELGIAN  ARMY  AND                          AIR FORCE.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    ON  the 14th May last  M. van Zeeland  asked  me when I was  in  Genevawhether the supply of munitions to Belgium from the United Kingdom could bediscussed by the two Governments.  He pointed out that an important  part ofthe Belgian munitions plant was stationed in territory near the  German frontier,which would have to  be  abandoned early in  the event of a successful german invasion  of Belgium.  I informed M. van Zeeland that I felt doubtful whether that actual moment was appropriate for the adoption of this proposal.    2.   When M. van Zeeland came to London at the end of July he raised thematter again,  and on the 25th July M. Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister,communicated a memorandum which reads as follows :           &apos;&apos;  The supply of Our Army is to a great extent and in certain important    respects  dependent  on   the co-operation of foreign  countries.   If this    co-operation is not assured, the supply is precarious.  The following cases    may be cited as examples : gunpowder (poudres de  guerre), of  which our    factories are unable to produce more than  one-twentieth of our requirements;    explosives, for which we have no national source of production;  cartridges    (infantry), of which we can only produce  one-third of our needs;  petrol (for    aeroplanes), of which the stock at bur disposal represents at a maximum    four days&apos; consumption, while it is impossible, by reason of the prohibition to    which  the British importer is subjected, to increase this stock.&quot;    3.   The matter was referred by me to the Sub-Committee on Defence Policyand Requirements (Paper D.P.R./114).  No action was taken, and the Sub-Committee  on Defence Policy and Requirements, which  had the memorandumunder consideration at its twenty-seventh meeting on  the 8th October, only passed a resolution respecting the departmental arrangements for considering applica-tions for export of war material from foreign countries.    4.   When he came to London at the end of November,  M. van Zeeland raised the matter  again and asked  if the Belgian  military  authorities could  not  beallowed to  make immediate arrangements with our  military authorities  for  an agreed supply of  certain kinds of war material (no doubt those mentioned  byM.  Spaak in July) to the Belgian Army in the event  of the latter being involvedin a war against Germany.    5.   As on former occasions, I promised to make  enquiries,  but warnedM.  van Zeeland of the difficulties in the way of our supplying at present any foreign Governments with war material.    6.   It  is not clear whether the Belgian Government only want to know whatsupplies can be made available in the event of war, i.e., in the event of the Belgian      8983  [14393]Printed for the Cabinet.

factories being overrun by a German Army, or whether they want to know whatsupplies we can furnish them  with now with  the  intent of making purchasesimmediately.    7.  I recommend  that, on  political grounds, the Cabinet  should authoriseconversations between the Belgian Military Attache and the War Office in orderto ascertain exactly what the Belgian request amounts  to, and to endeavour inevery possible way to meet it.  I would suggest that the Belgian Military Attache&quot;should be invited &apos;    (1) To state the Belgian Governments requirements in detail, and    (2) To explain whether it is a matter of immediate purchases or whether it          is a matter  of making arrangements now whereby purchases could be          made in the event of war.    8.  I have consulted the Secretary of  State for War in the matter, and  Iunderstand that he sees no objection  to the proposed exploratory conversations between the Belgian Military Attache and the War Office.                                                                 A. E.  -  Foreign Office, January 6, 1937.
