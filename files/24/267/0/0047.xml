mm[3 DOCUMENT IS THJj PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVIORNM^TT)&apos;... p. 46 (57).                                        V  COPY NO.-              CABINET.      Til*; RQ3J:S OF TH3 BRITISH ARMY.Menorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination                of Defence.1.      The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Cornrnittee in their Reporton the Role of the British Army base their conclusions onthe statement contained in the White Paper of March, 1936,describing the three functions of the Array;  they are:-&apos;           (i)  to maintain garrisons overseas;          (ii)  to provide the military share in home                 defence and internal security;         (iii)  in time of emergency to provide a                 properls?&quot; equipped force ready to                 proceed overseas wherever wanted.They build on this foundation an argument not for increasingthe strength either of the Regular Array, or of the territorial force, but for providing modern equipment for all the unitsof the Regular Army and equipment for the Territorial Forceof the same type as the corresponding units of the RegularArmy.   The Chiefs of&quot; Staff Sub-Committee further recommend.that&quot;our ultimate aim&quot; should be to enable the territorial force to be ready four months after the outbreak of war,(para.&apos;28).   It is clear that the reference to a stateof readiness is intended to cover readiness to proceedoverseas in support of the Regular Army in case of need.
2.      The Sub-Committee were requested by the terms ofreference to consider the relative merits of a land forceand an air force to be provided at an equivalent expenditure.It will be seen that they answer this question by calling attention to the composite nature of a modern war in whichall three services must be prepared to co-pperate vvith eachother, the inference being that it is not possible to dispense with any of the three services when plans are being made fora major European War.   At the same time the Sub-Committeedeprecate (para. 16) the suggestion that we should prepare for a land campaign in which this country would provide alarge national army on the 1914-18 scale.3.      It is plain from the account given of the reasonsfor the existing organisation of the Territorial Force onthe basis of twelve Divisions that the Sub-Committee donot regard this strength as having any special merit.   Twelveis in fact an arbitrary figure, except for the advantage which it has of fitting the geographical conditions of GreatBritain.   On the other hand the Sub-Committee evidentlyregard a Territorial Force of twelve Divisions as theirreducible minimum.4.      I find it impossible to resist the view that if weare to maintain a Regular Army cf any given size, the onlysafe course is to train and equip a second line from whichunits in support of the Regular y\rmy may be sent overseasin an emergency.    The only alternative is to rely on timebeing available for raising, training and equipping thenecessary reinforcements, very much in the same way as the
Kitchener Armies were raised in the Great War.   Thiswould in my judgment he an untenable position,0  it wouldcertainly be difficult -.,o defend it in Parliament asIon;  as we have a Territorial Force at all.   In the debates which have taken place in the last nine months,the House of Commons has been very sensitive tocriticisms of the unpreparedness of the territorial force, and has shown dissatisfaction with the lack of equipment for training purposes revealed in debate.I am sure that parliament and the country expect theTerritorial Force to be treated as an integral part ofour forces available for service in a major iCuropeanifar and to be equipped sufficiently to enable it toplay its part.5.      It by no means follows, however, that theTerritorial Force should be maintained in as complete astate of readiness as the Regular Army.   There is nodoubt about the almost universal unwillingness of thecountry to prepare an army on anything like the 1914-18scale.   This is partly based on reasoning that the new factor which has come into existence in the shape of theRoyal Air Force should count for a great deal of the effort which the Army made in the Great War, and partlyalso on the instinctive feeling that we simply cannotsustain a large army in peace while we maintain a very powerful and modern Havy and an equally powerful and up-to-date Air Force.   I fully share these views, and
I go so far as to say that we cannot afford to maintain in complete readiness in peace time a Field Force of17 Divisions, composed of the Regular Army and theTerritorial Force.   If we cannot afford to do this, i see no object in treating this as if it was the idealto be aimed at.6.      In this connection it is worthy of &apos;remark thatthe Sub-Committee state (para. 22) that the territorial force could only be trained in peace time to a &quot;limited extent&quot; and that after embodiment it would require &quot;atleast&quot; four months intensive training before it wouldbe fit for service abroad.   This is consistent withthe description given in the White Paper (para. 33) ofthe functions of the Territorial Force.   It is in truth,as there stated, &quot;the second line in our military forces&quot;,except in so far as it is the first line in anti-aircraft and coast defence at home.7.      It follows from the above in my submission thatjust as the Territorial Force can only be trained inpeace time &quot;to a limited extent&quot;, so its equipment oughtto be on a more limited scale than that of the RegularArmy.   If this is accepted, it only remains to lay downsome standard to which supply plans may conform.   In thenext paragraph I suggest a formula which in my opinion satis-fie s the requirements of the Force as a potential support for the
Regular Army and also conforms  to the economy which must &quot;bepractised in peace time if our  backs are not to be broken.8.     The equipment of the Regular Army must be the mostcomplete and efficient that can be designed.   The same isnecessary in the case of the two Anti-aircraft divisions of the Territorial Force.    The remainder of the territorial force must be trained in the use of the same weapons as theRegular Army.   For this purpose they must be given sufficientequipment for training purposes, having regard to their position in our Defence Forces   as stated in paragraph 6 ofthis Memorandum.     The equipment thus provided for theTerritorial Force would, be spread evenly over the whole ofthe twelve Divisions, and in the event of an emergency itshould be possible to equip fully one. or more Divisions(according to the stage which the programme had reached) by drawing upon the equipment of the Force as a whole.    In thisway I should anticipate that one or more Divisions could besent out in reinforcement of the Regular Army after not morethan 4 months from the outbreak of war.   Meanwhile thesupply capacity which will have been already planned,  wouldbe brought into production and  a succession of reinforcementsbecome available up to the total war strength of theTerritorial Force.9.     I do not read the Report of the Sub-Committee asrecommending anything inconsistent with the foregoingsuggestion.    It is true that the statement In paragraph 28of their Report of what the Sub-Committee describe as onr&quot;ultimate aim&quot;  seems to go further than my proposal, but inany case we are a long way off  that position  and I cannot see it as practical politics at the moment.      Read as awhole the Report seems to me to justify the conclusions I have                         -5-
formed, and I put them forward as a plan to which we maywork.   If they are approved, the War Office will be able,in consultation - with the&apos; Treasury, to take immediate stepsto put them into effect.                         (intl&apos;d&apos;d)  T..W. H.
