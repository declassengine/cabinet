LOAN  OF MILITARY  STORES  FOR THE USE OF UNEMPLOYED MARCHERS .                Memorandum by the Minister of  Health.       1.  After  careful  reconsideration I can find no  reason for  modifying the views which I recently expressed in correspondence  with the Secretary  of State for War and which are accurately  reproduced  in paragraph  6 of C.P.36(37).       2.  I should  explain at the outset that I am entirely in.  accord  with the view that  the organisation of marches of the  unemployed is,  in. the  general public interest, highly undesirable and ought so far  as possible to be discouraged.   The essential question  of principle  here involved seems,  however, to me to be not whether  the  Government  should  or should not  do  something which might be construed as giving  encouragement to the  marchers and those who support them,  but whether  or not  they should  in certain ciroumstances be willing to  give  assistance  to local authorities in  the discharge of their  statutory  duties.  For myself, I  think it would be wrong to  decide  in advance  that assistance  should  in those circumstances invariably be withheld&apos;.       &apos;3.   I think too that there are considerable political  objections  to the policy which  I understand the Service  Departments  to favour.   Sympathy with the  marchers  (which does not  necessarily  imply sympathy with their political aims)  is  not confined  to our  political opponents;  and I  can well imagine  that such an  incident  as a marchers death from pneumonia  following  a Government  refusal  to lend blankets to a public assistance authority might  lead to  public outcry which would be extremely embarrassing to the Government  I have already  referred  in my correspondence  with the  Secretary of  State for War to the  desirability of helping  to avoid, when possible,  occasions of  friction between the local authorities and  the men.
     4. -  For these reasons., I am of the firm opinion that itwould he impolitic to decide that all applications to the--service departments for the loan of blankets should, as a matter ofprinciple, be refused,   If the Cabinet should accept that view,there remains the question whether it is better that all such applications should be automatically acceded to or that eachapplication should be considered on its merits by consultation between the Departments affected.   I myself think that the latterprocedure has considerable advantages over the former since casesmight well arise in which my Department would be able to arrangefor the local authorityfs requirements to be met by other means.My local officers keep the Department very closely in touch withthe progress of the marches, and I do not anticipate that the kindof ad hoc consultation which I have in mind should involve anyserious difficulties or delays.                                          K. W.                                            January 29th, 1937.
