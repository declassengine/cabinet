THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy No.CP. 1 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    HAVING regard to recurring acts of violence in Palestine, the necessity forsuppressing Arab newspapers and other disturbing reports, I recently telegraphedto the High Commissioner for Palestine asking him to let me have an appreciation of the internal situation in that country.  I now circulate, for the information ofmy colleagues, the appreciation which Sir Arthur Wauchope has telegraphed tome, together with a further telegram giving the comparative figures  referred toin the appreciation (Annexure I).    2.  This appreciation confirms the view which I had formed as  to the non-political character of the acts of brigandage which have been taking place, andalso as  to the improbability of any serious general disorder in Palestine untilthe report of the  Royal Commission has been  received and the intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government based upon that report are made known.  Rut I feel, as i know  Sir Arthur Wauchope does, that the present period must be looked upon only as an  interlude, and that the prospects for the year which is  now beginning arevery  gloomy.   From  various sources,  including secret intelligence,  there  isinformation which shows that racial feeling between Arabs and  Jews  has becomegreatly  intensified and that there is a growing tendency to extremist views on both sides, more particularly among the Arabs, and that active preparation forfurther  disorder is not lacking.    3.  I circulate also with this memorandum the following papers :     (a)  Copy of a letter  from Sir Arthur Wauchope dated the 16th December,           forwarding notes of a most interesting talk which, he has had with          Dr. Weizmann (Annexure II).    (b)  Extract   from   a  letter  from  Sir   Arthur   Wauchope,  dated  the          24th December,  in which he was replying  to a  personal letter from          myself raising, in a preliminary way,  the question of the  permanent          garrison for  Palestine (Annexure  III).              It will be seen that Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s provisional conclusions          are that, for  the present and  until the impending crisis has been          passed, we must rely upon British  troops to supplement the police in          maintaining or restoring public security, and that, when  that crisis          has been met and overcome and more normal conditions are restored,          we can decide what permanent security force is best adapted to the          needs of Palestine.    (c)  Extract from  an important letter, dated the 20th December, which I          have received from Lord Peel (Annexure IV).              This  letter  emphasises  the   difficulty  and  danger   of  the          situation in Palestine arising  from the  hatred in which the Jews          are now held  by the Arabs and the fear which the Arabs have of          Jewish domination.   I   may  say  that  I  agree  generally  with      [14354]                                                      B
            what  Lord Peel  says, except where he  states that nobody makes            any attempt  to  bring about a  reconciliation between Arabs and            Jews.   I do not think Lord Peel meant that to  be taken literally            as a considered expression of opinion, but lest it might  be misunder-            stood  I feel  it  necessary to point  out that no  one could have            done more than Sir Arthur Wauchope in his efforts during  the last            five years to bring about an improvement in the relations between the            two races.  He had  succeeded in getting Arabs  and Jews to serve            together on various Boards and Committees; the Municipal Councils,            in  which he  has taken a special interest,  have  worked  very well            considering the difficulties; and, as the last step  in this process, he            had planned  with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  the            establishment of a Legislative Council in  the course of 1936, in which            both Jews and Arabs would take part. Further, Sir Arthur Wauchope            has been in very close personal contact with  Jews and Arabs, both            officially and socially, and at any rate until the recent exacerbation of            feeling  there were  Government  officials  especially  in the  district            administration who&quot; made a point of trying to get members of  the two            races together socially.  As regards the schools, to which Lord Peel            draws attention, it must be borne in mind that Jews have  insisted upon            education in Hebrew  with an entirely Jewish background, and  the            Arabs also have demanded education in  their own language.   In  the            result,  the  Jews  have largely  organised and managed  their  own            schools without much control by Government, while the education            organised directly by Government has been almost entirely  for  the            Arabs.   This system  is doubtless open  to  criticism,  but it is  an            inheritance from  the past and  any  combination of the  races  for            education purposes would, at this moment, be beset with very great            difficulties.     4.   It  is  clear that the  problem  presented  by  Palestine   is  extremely intractable.  It is  easy enough to criticise, but it is very difficult, as Lord Peel recognises,  to find constructive proposals.  I do not suggest  in  circulating this memorandum that  any action is called for at the moment.  An  announcement has recently been issued in Palestine that  arrangements are being made  for members of the Palestine Royal Commission to leave Palestine on  the 12th January, and, unless after all the Arabs decide to give evidence, I assume that they  will leave on that date and return to this country at the beginning of Februarj^ after  a short-stay in Egypt,  where they will sift their ideas and-form  provisional conclusions on the evidence which they have taken.  We can only  await now the  report which the  Royal Commission produce, but I wished my colleagues to  know the position generally as reflected in the papers attached  to this memorandum,  and to warn them that we may have to take very strong  action if disorders break out again after the Royal Commission^ report has been published.

ANNEXURE I.                                     (1)Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary     of State for the Colonies. Dated December 29, 1936; Received  4-59 P.M.     December 29, 1936.     IMMEDIATE.  NO. 953.  Secret.     Your  telegram  No. 728.  The  situation in Palestine is one of politicaltension accompanied by intense racial animosity and a feeling of suspense onthe part of both Arabs and Jews.     2.  There has been an increase of acts of highway robbery during this month,but  the underlying motive  is  economic  or  criminal and  not political.   the indications are  that these incidents are contrary  to the wishes of  the  Arabpolitical leaders  and, indeed,  the majority of the victims have been Arabs.  Therewere fifteen cases of highway robbery as compared with seven in November.     My immediately following telegram contains comparable  figures  for  othercrimes of violence.     Special police measures have been taken to deal with highway robbery, anda number of arrests  have been made.  In view of the fact that bands of personswanted by  the police for  activities during and before the disturbances are still at large and  unable to earn a livelihood the increased incidence of highwayrobbery was to be expected.     3.   Jewish  press has greatly exaggerated these incidents.  In some  casespress reports of  incidents have  been  entirely without foundation, while in many other cases they have been grossly exaggerated.  The objects  of what appearsto be a policy of exaggeration are probably (a) to impress the Royal commission with the lawlessness of Arabs,  and  (b) to prevent further reduction of british garrison and discharge of  Jewish  supernumerary  police,  both of which are regarded by the  Jewish community with apprehension.     4.   It  is common belief  among both Arabs and Jews that if the  report ofthe Royal  Commission  and  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government&apos;s  decision thereon areunfavourable to  the Arabs, disturbances will break out again.   Jews openly andcontinually accuse Arabs  of  making preparations for rebellion,  and  it is  truethat the atmosphere of tension is being  maintained by incitement in  the  press and speeches in mosques, and  by a campaign, accompanied with a certain amountof intimidation,  to boycott Jewish goods and services. A similar campaign morediscreetly applied is being organised by Jews and directed against Arab labourand products.     5.   In  the absence of any  incidents likely to  inflame public opinion, myadvisers consider that there is little  prospect of  any serious general disorder inPalestine until the  report of the Royal Commission  and the  intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to that report are known.

ANNEXURE II.         Letter from Sir Arthur Wauchope to Sir Cosmo Parkinson.                                     Government House,My dear Parkinson,                           Jerusalem, December 16, 1936.    I THINK the enclosed notes on a talk I had with Weizmann are of interest.I hear before leaving Jerusalem he said &quot; I got nothing out of Sir Arthur.&quot;.    I should be foolish indeed were I to forecast to anyone Governments policy at this stage.    When threatened  it  is wise to consider  what the threatener  can achieve.I do not believe the Jews will attack Arabs, they stand to lose too  much.    For the same reason I do not believe the Agency or even the Executive wouldresign.  But no doubt^the Zionists are thoroughly dissatisfied with His Majesty&apos;governments  decision Weizmann will raise  a campaign both in England and america.                                            Yours,                                                ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.                                      Government House,                                             Jerusalem, December 15,  1936.    DR.  WEIZMANN stayed with me for  the night of the 13th  December, andwe had a long talk before dinner and another next morning.    After  some interesting talk as to  the transfer  of  the Agricultural Schoolfrom the University to Rehovoth, and the satisfactory results of Dr. Weizmann&apos;sexperiments as to citrus juices including  grape juices, and also of vinegar, andMr. Rose&apos;s favourable opinion as to marketing possibilities of all three in England,we turned  to the European situation.    Dr. Weizmann felt if there were no war for two years war might be escaped.He thought by then England would be far  stronger.  I asked if he meant actuallyor relatively to other countries such as Germany.  He said  Chetwode, and I thinkhe said Mr. Duff Cooper, told him both.  He thought M. Blum  was so  able hewould  succeed in arranging France&apos;s finances even though France&apos;s expenditure was greatly increasing.  This, I noted, was the  exact  opposite  of the opinionMr. Rutenberg recently expressed to me.    Dr. Weizmann thought Mr. Winston - Churchill&apos;s estimate of German war expenditure was correct.   On three experimental lines  production of syntheticrubber, light metal, and synthetic fat from petrol oil, Germany had spent in thelast three years  400,000 (?) milliards of gold marks.  He added  that there was certainly plenty of tinder lying about.    I then turned the talk  to the situation in Palestine by saying that there wasplenty of tinder blowing about in this country.    Dr. Weizmann then spoke with some  vehemence as  to the Arab Federation.He had heard that it was generally held  that  there was  a solid block of Arabpeoples who could  make the  position for the  British in Palestine so difficult and so constantly threatened  that the  English were tempted  to say  they had done their  duty,.a National Home is now established, formed  and existing, andit is neither their duty nor their interest to go on allowing  immigration when that course will only mean war  or constant strife against Arabs in  Palestineactively supported by so formidable a combination.    Dr.  Weizmann considered this  terribly false  reasoning.   The  difficultiesof the Arabs were  only just  beginning a united Arab  Federation was a fardistant idea, and does not enter into practical politics.    Of the three Arab kingdoms, he said, consider the position  of Syria:  onthe West a permanent hostile Lebanon, on  the North the Sanjak of Alexandrettawas formerly Turkish and would soon  again be Turkish.  Ankora not Bagdadheld the keys of the situation.  The Alouites and Druzes are nc\   xr from friendly and would  soon begin to be actively hostile to the new Syrian Government.    Consider  Iraq a country quite unfit for self-government,  hostile  Kurds,hostile tribes on the Euphrates Dr. Weizmann did  not mention Saudi Arabia,but asked is it a Federation of this sort that is to compel England to break herpromises and throw over the Jews ?
/                                    )                                     5                     /     Should England do so he could say the 400,000 Jews in Palestine would neversubmit.  They would show themselves to be as formidable in action as they had hitherto shown themselves strong in restraint.  He, Dr. Weizmann, would resign,the whole Executive and Agency would resign and England, he said and  who could speak with better authority? would be faced with 400,000 Jews all inrevolt in Palestine backed by millions of Jews in America and elsewhere deter-mined to gain their just rights and the fulfilment of the promises made to them.     After the air had cooled, I remarked I had no idea what recommendations theRoyal  Commission  would make or what decisions His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould make, but to me  it was inconceivable that either would be based on  fearof what the Arabs or Jews  would do or try to do.     I was convinced both the Royal Commission and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould reason on very different lines to those put forward by Dr. Weizmann.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not endeavour to find that course which was leastdreadful for England to follow,  but would try to decide on that course whichjustice to Arabs  and Jews demands.     I recalled Dr. Weizmann&apos;s earlier remark that the Arabs of  Palestine were now all extremists, but that in Syria and the&apos; Lebanon and Iraq there were manysensible people with far more moderate tendencies.  If this were the case, and Ibelieved it true, it might be expected that the Arab  rulers would exert a goodrather than  an  evil influence.   These rulers had been the chief  factor in the sudden ending of the strike and disorders.  Consequently, it seemed to me their advice had been  on the side of moderation in the past and might well be useful inthe future.     Dr. Weizmann turned from this argument by referring again to the Lebanonand asked me my views as to settlement in Transjordan.     I  recalled our  first discussion on that subject when we visited  the Hulehtogether with Lord Swinton, then Secretary of State for the/ Colonies, and  saidmy opinions were unchanged.  I hoped that, eventually,  settlement of Jews inTransjordan would take place,  but it could not be started while feelings  were sobitter.     I  quoted Cromer, who  had said that,  as an old official, he would carry outfaithfully whatever  instructions he received, but I was convinced that whateverdecisions His Majesty&apos;s Government arrived at would be enforced.  I emphasised that the situation would be very different  after His Majesty&apos;s Government had given a decision, than it was during the last six months before we knew what therecommendations of the Commission or decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be.     Dr. Weizmann  said clearly that he understood that.   But he was anxious;rumours were rife and members  of the Cabinet had infinite  troubles to fight against, and they would be reluctant to incur chances  of having to fight an ArabFederation.     He again explained how the  Arab Federation was a bogey, but people some-times submitted  to bogeys, and he impressed on me most fervently how far strongerin reality were the 400,000  Jews  in Palestine with their backing  outside.  Thatwas a fact for  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  to remember and  which  he wouldimpress upon Lord Peel.     It  was ignorance or blindness towards these two facts that made him  fearunjust actions.     I  said, once again, that we should try to follow  the fairest course,  not theone that  seemed to  offer  the  fewest difficulties, but whatever decisions  HisMajesty&apos;s Government decided on he could be certain would be carried out.  ThisDr. Weizmann said  gave him a spark.of hope.  After a pause he said it wouldbe  illogical to reduce immigration to 40,000 (at  another time he threw  out thefigure of 10,000, but both figures were only given to illustrate his  point),  becausethe  economic absorptive capacity would allow more, but he admitted in  life we.could not always be logical, and  he could accept some reduction, but the Arabswould refuse to agree even  to 3,000 a year it was impossible to  deal with such people.  Two and a half years ago many Arabs  were moderate and reasonable,.now all were extremists.     I said I agreed with his statement, but to what causes did he attribute thechange ?     He replied  at once, Abyssinia.  Mussolini had made the Arabs believe  that England would always give  way to force.       [14354]                                                    B3
    I  did not say so, but it was clear to me that Dr.  Weizmann seemed to  belabouring under the same delusion.    I  said I considered that the action taken  by England in  Egypt, which  i thought statesmanlike, and  also the action of France in Syria, had stimulatedArabs in Palestine to a much more extreme position, and to this Dr. Weizmannfully agreed.    I  then recalled his saying that M. Blum and the  Lebanese would welcomeJews  to the Lebanon, and asked if he meant large settlements  of Jews or onlyexperts.  He said certainly experts, and perhaps both.  The Lebanon was notPalestine, but Jews would look on it as the next best thing, especially the districtnear Tyre and Sidon.    Dr. Weizmann asked me if I thought the deportation of the Mufti wouldprecipitate a conflict.  I said, possibly, yes; but six months ago the  effect wouldhave been greater than to-day, and would have raised religious as well as politicaltroubles.  With this Dr. Weizmann agreed, and added he supposed I had wanted to avoid extending the conflict before the arrival of the Royal Commission 1    I  replied that was true, but I hoped he would avoid that dangerous error  ofattributing all action and power to one man, the Mufti.  Were that  theory true,then we had only got to  remove that  man, and  the vigour  of any  rebellion  inPalestine was gone.   This was as dangerous  as it was false.  National feeling was widespread.  The Istiqlal party formerly were much more extreme than the mufti.  I looked on the  Mufti as an example of what Dr. Weizmann had noticed,namely, the steep and lamentable decline of moderation in the Arab outlook duringthe past two years.    Finally, Dr. Weizmann said there were two alternatives : the first is to acceptthe fact that the Arabs will not  recognise the Mandate  and will  continue,  to oppose all Jewish immigration, and meet this attitude by admitting,  say, 300,000Jews in the next two or three years.  When the Jews were 3/4 million they could hold their own in Palestine.    The  second alternative  is for the  British Government to play false  by theJews, discard the principle of absorptive capacity, and condemn the Jews to  bea permanent minority;  this policy  will at once make the. Jews more desperatethan the Arabs; they will no longer show any restraint in  Palestine  and will  bebacked by every Jew all over the world.  How much more dangerous,  he added, is this second course for England than the first.    I felt it useless to say for a third time that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbase their decisions on what they consider to be the merits of the case rather thanon the dangers real or imaginary that might seem to beset every course.    I  felt the first evening we started at  loggerheads but by next morning wehad apparently slipped back to our old relationship.  He said Jews would neverforget what they owed to me in the past.   I have always looked on him as  a mostsincere and zealous lover of his people,  moved to the core by their present wrongsand sufferings.   A lover also of England so long as English policy helps to lessenthose sufferings and wrongs.  Should England falter in what he,  not we, consider to be  English duties  in this cause, he will show  a bitterness towards Englandexceeding in intensity the feelings that now animate  the Mufti, who likewisefears  his people may  suffer intolerable wrongs.                                       Yours very sincerely,                                                 ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.ANNEXURE III.             Extract from a Letter from Sir Arthur Wauchope.                                      Government House,Dear Ormsby Gore,                           Jerusalem, December 24. 1936.          *          *           *        .  *          * -     &apos;&quot;   *         &apos;    I UNDERSTAND the anxiety of the  War  Office to reduce as soon as possiblethe British Garrison in this country and to substitute some locally recruited forcein its place.  But for the reasons which I shall  try to explain in this letter, Ithink that in the next few months it would be unwise to attempt such a step and
that a decision  as  to the strength and composition of the permanent security forces in Palestine  must wait until the situation here is clearer.      .  :    It is, I admit,  dangerous to prophesy as to coming events in Palestine, butI look on the present period as an interlude a temporary state of  affairs that,cannot continue  for many more months.  There is at present an unnatural degreeof political tension, hostility to Government and  acute inter-racial animosity.The whole atmosphere  is so highly charged with excitement that  the. presentsituation cannot last.  One of two things must surely  happen, either the royal commissions  report  and the  decisions of His  Majesty&apos;s Government  will beregarded as satisfactory by the Arabs, in Avhich case, so  far as they are concerned,the present tension  and hostility will gradually disappear and normal conditionswill return; or  they will regard the decisions of His  Majesty&apos;s Government asunsatisfactory and there will  be another outbreak of rebellion. ^ In the latterevent, it is my intention at once to delegate Martial Law powers to General Dill,who will be able to  act with much more freedom than was possible or  right beforethe Royal Commission had made their recommendations and before His Majesty&apos;s.Government had given their final decisions.  Should  rebellion  occur, rebellionwill be suppressed^  if need be by severe measures such as will prevent  any furtherrising for some years to come.     Thus,  whether  the Arabs react favourably or unfavourably to the findings ofthe Royal Commission, the resultant situation as regards public security is likelyto be much the same.  It will then be possible to organise with much more prospectof success a defence organization suitable to the country and to future conditions.If, however, the attempt were to be made now before the situation has stabilizedand while conditions are still abnormal and fluid, the result would, I feel, be most unsatisfactory and any estimation of our future needs would be falsified by events.     There are three factors in the present situation which cannot be neglected :      (a) Any new force that we might raise must.be ready  to act, that is, it must           be recruited, organized and  trained, before there is serious danger of           an Arab rising,  that is within a few months from now.   Even under           more favourable conditions I submit it would occupj^ more than a year           to make any new force even fairly efficient.     (b) In view of  the present widespread hostility towards Government, I think           it would be most unwise to arm any additional Arabs at  present.     (c) Apart  from  this,  in view of the fact that at no time have relations           between Arabs and Jews been so bitter or racial hatred so intense, I           doubt whether   any mixed force could  be recruited  now;  and  if           recruited I fear there is no doubt that  any new mixed force without           tradition  of  loyalty  to  officers or to Government would  become a           liability rather  than an asset to the security of the country.     Consequently,  I submit that our task to-day must necessarily be limited  topreparation for the immediate  future, designed to meet the danger  of an earlyresumption of disorder.  Once  that danger has  been met  or has passed, we canplan for the future.     It would, of course, be easier to expand the Transjordan Frontier Force, an existing unit, rather than to raise an entirely new force. But, frankly, in presentcircumstances I should be most reluctant to arm any more Arabs.  I doubt alsowhether Jews would join the Transjordan Frontier Force in any numbers except as separate and self-contained units, and, as you know, there are most weightyobjections to the formation of  Jewish military  units  liable to be employed for offensive action  against Arabs, objections which are especially strong  while racial hatred is so bitter.     For the close defence of Jewish settlements we have organized an auxiliaryJewish police force which, with its various reserves, will number  3,000, and I amconsidering enrolling a further 3,000 selected Jews who would be ready to come forward as auxiliary police should the need  arise.   With these  auxiliary police the Jewish settlements should be in a position to deal  effectively with any Arabattacks, thus releasing British troops and the regular police for  other duties.         *          *          *           *           * &apos; &apos;     .   *     Mr. Spicer, the  Inspector-General  of Police,  tells me that  the  161 Britishpolice whose recruitment you have already sanctioned will not be trained before
April, and this will only be achieved by curtailing their period of training from months,  which has  hitherto been  considered  necessary, to 2 months.   It  is.therefore no use for me  to ask for any further  increase until  the  Inspector-General is in a position to train them.  I will therefore postpone dealing with thistill next February.    As you know from my despatch of the 17th December, Mr. Spicer does notconsider that many of the British Police personnel of the Egyptian City  police would prove suitable for our purposes.  However, since receiving your letter ofthe 17th December I have instructed him to send an experienced Police  officer to Cairo and find out exactly how many of their 184 men would be  suitable and willing to come to Palestine.    I share your liking in principle for locally recruited police forces,  but  I fearif a rising on a serious  scale takes place next year the conduct  of even ourtrained Arab police is.  not  predictable, and both Spicer and I  would predict thatArab Police freshly raised now would be quite unreliable.  They would not resist the pressure that would be brought to bear  on them and even  more effectively ontheir families.    My provisional conclusions therefore are that for the present, and until the impending crisis has been passed, we must rely upon British troops to supplement the police in maintaining  or restoring public security.  No alternative security organisation  could be created in  the present  abnormal circumstances,  or, ifcreated, would be ready for use by the time that we shall most probably need it.When the crisis has been met and overcome and more normal and stable  conditionsrestored, then, and not till then, can we decide what permanent security force is best adapted to the needs of this country.    Such are my present  opinions, and  these,- I may say, are supported by myChief Secretary and by the Inspector-General, but I shall,  of course, be mostready to discuss the  whole  problem with  you when I  come to  London  early next year.ANNEXURE  IV.                    Extract from a Letter from Earl Peel.(Personal.)                             Palestine  Royal Commission,Dear Ormsby Gore,                           Jerusalem, December 20, 1936.                    ^           ^?           &quot;K*           ^     You ask me to give you one or two general impressions.  I will try to do soas briefly as possible.     (1) Though I knew there was ill-feeling  between Jews and Arabs,-1 had not realised the depth and intensity of the hatred  with which the Jews are held bythe Arabs.   I did not realise how deep-seated was the Arab fear of Jewish over-lordship and domination.  These feelings, it seems to be generally admitted, haveincreased in force  and depth during the last few years.  I need not go throughthe causes;  they are familiar to you.  But it is the wide gap social, moral andpolitical which divides  the two races  that is  really disturbing.     (2) The Jewish conception of the &quot; National Home &quot; has developed in thelast  few years.   They regard Palestine now  as a refuge for the threatened andill-treated Jews of Europe Germany, Poland, Roumania, and elsewhere.  Theyare determined, by means legal or illegal, to pour into Palestine as many of thesedistressed Jews as possible.  The idea of Palestinian citizenship is a farce;  theJews cultivate  loyalty to the Jews, and Arabs to the Arabs, but there is no sign of fusion of the two races.     (3) As to reconciliation between the two  races,  nobody makes any attempt tobring it about.  No doubt for this the provision in the Mandate about languages.is partly to blame.   The Arabs and Jews are brought up in separate schools; they see nothing of each other and are taught by persons, who certainly do nothing tocreate good feeling.     (4) I am giving these impressions, of course, in rough outline, but it is plain that there are several Governments in this country.  The Jewish  Agency is  far
more than a body for co-operating or helping the Government:  it is very nearly a separate Government itself, with its departments framed on political lines.   it makes its representations to Government on every possible aspect of policy, quite apart from activities with which you are more familiar than I am at home. Then,of course, there is the Arab Higher Committee, whose word is law.  We haveproof of that in the refusal of the Arabs to give evidence before us.  We havehad intimations from independent Arabs that some of the officials would like togive evidence, but nobody dares to resist  the orders of the Central Committee.Even the other day we were asked by a neutral banker to meet some leading Arabsat tea;  on  the morning of the day they refused to come on  the plea that it was against the wishes of the Mufti and the Arab  Higher  Committee.  Then comesthe British Administration,  unpopular with both sides and trying to keep anuneasy balance between them.  We quite  understand that the Government here is  placed in a  very difficult position.   Every Act that it does is carefullyscrutinised to see whether it falls on the Arab or on the Jewish side of the line.    (5)  As regards security, the Police are very doubtful whether they can rely on the Arab policemen in case of another rising.  They are good enough  for ordinary crime, but when the time of political  stress comes they  cannot, we  are told, be relied upon.  The Jews, of course, have been demanding largely increasedpolice and military forces to protect them from  the Arabs.  They ask for special constables  in every Jewish village; they think  that, if they get their quotas of jews into the country, they will be able to protect themselves against the Arabs,but meanwhile there is  a desperate  race between  Arab fertility and jewish immigration.    (6)  I feel it difficult to describe the unpleasant atmosphere of suspicion andsecrecy with which one is surrounded.  I have no means of knowing whether theremay be another Arab uprising  in April or May, but most people seem to expectthese disturbances and talk of them as if they were quite  a matter of course.  EvenGovernment officials  cannot give evidence in public because they say, if they wereto speak the truth with frankness, their  usefulness as officials in this  country would be gone.  However, we will do our  best  to examine the grievances underthe Mandate.  The Jewish grievances very largely consist of complaints that theGovernment should spend far more money on developing ports and settling Jewson the land in order to increase the economic absorptive power of the country,  butit is, of course, racial issues that are dominant.    I may add that, with one or two small exceptions, no one seems to be able toput forward any constructive  suggestions unless the Arab  proposal  to  banishthe Jews or  stop  immigration,  prevent sales of land,  and at once establish  a legislative Assembly, can be expressed in these terms.    Rumbold has seen this  letter and xhinks it a very temperate statement ofthe situation.                                                       Yours sincerely,PEEL.
