(THIS j22LTg^^                        BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ),iiORET.n?73iT37)CABINET,WATERLOO BRIDGE.     MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT.         The question of a Government grant towards the cost ofbuilding the new Waterloo Bridge has once more been raised by adeputation from the London County Council, which I recentlyreceivedo         The deputation was representative of all parties in theCouncil and was unanimous in representing that the presentposition was most unfair to the London ratepayer.   Itsspokesmen said in effect that.successive Governments had supported successive councils in the view, formed upon expertadvice9 that the proper course was to remove the old bridge andreplace it by one better fitted to carry traffic., and thatgrants from the Road Fund had been promised for this purpose         While they did not dispute the propriety of theGovernment&apos;s decision in 1932 that it was debarred from making agrant towards the building of a new bridge, when, by rejecting the application for power to borrow for this purpose made in theCouncil&apos;s Money Bill of that year, the House of Commons had expressed an adverse view upon the proposal, they consideredthat in the altered circumstances of the present time theGovernment should revise its attitude .         In justification of this course, they suggested thatthe original decision had largely been influenced by urgentconsiderations of economy, that a new situation had been created by the fact that the old bridge no longer existed, and that, as last session Parliament reversed previous decisions andsanctioned &quot;borrowing powers for the construction of the newbridge, there could be no constitutional, objection to a grant from the Road Fund.
         They also represented that it was unfair that this important public work should he the only one of its kind in the whole country not to attract a grant from the Road Fund and -pointed out that 9 if its whole cost were thrown upon the London ratepayer9 the ability and willingness of the Council to co-operate with the Minister of Transport in carrying out other necessary London improvements mast be seriously weakened. They concluded by urging that the decision ought not to be influenced by any considerations of party,         &quot;with this last contention I am sure that my colleagues will agree, and it is9 I submit9 essential that any decision now given should be one to which we should adhere if 9 in March nextj there were any change in the political constitution of the London County Council,         I undertook to lay the representations made to me before my colleagues and to send a written reply.         The previous recent history of this matter had been before the Cabinet in Memoranda  CP.93(35) and C P. 114(36) 9 and I need not recapitulate it at length.         In 19549 the then Minister of Transport made it clear that if the House of Commons approved the proposal in the Council&apos;s Money Bill to borrow for the purpose of demolishing the old bridge and building a new one9 he would hold himself free to make a grant.    The proposal was rejected.   In 19359 it was revived9 in the Council&apos;s Money Bill for that year9 and acting upon the instructions of the cabinet I did not object to the grant of borrowing powers but stated, upon the SecondReading,,  that in view of Parliaments previous decisions (in 1932 and 1934) whatever decision the House might wish to reach on the financial method of meeting the cost and in particular on the proposal to allow the Council to borrow, there could no longer be any question of a grant from national funds,    I adopted the same attitude when the Council once more raised the
issue last session and, had I not done so, it is unlikely thatthey would have obtained the borrowing powers which they now make a ground for asking us to reconsider our decision.         If9  as I assume 9 the Cabinet adhere to their previousdecisions, I  suggest that I should reply to the L,C C. to theeffect that the Government have carefully considered the representations recently renewed &quot;by the Council in deputation to me9 that in view of the opposition of Parliament9unmistakably  expressed in 1932 and again in 1934-9 to thedestruction of the old Waterloo Bridge and. its replacement by anew one, the  Government had no alternative but to refuse tomake a grant  of public money from national funds to such a purpose and that while the Government put no difficulties inthe way of the Council as to the method of financing an expenditure which the Council decided to incur in opposition tothe wishes of Parliament, they have been bound to regard thequestion of a grant as closed and see now no reason forreopening it.                            (Initialled)  L, H-B.25th January, 1957.
