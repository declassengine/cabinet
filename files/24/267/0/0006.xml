THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT---                  -                   --  ^                  Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                         Copy No. 44CP. 5 (37).CABINET.ITALIAN WHEAT IMPORTS.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    MY colleagues will remember that at a recent meeting of the Cabinet it wassuggested that an abnormal quantity of wheat  had been imported  into Italyduring  the last few months, and it  was suggested that this might  imply anattempt of the Italian Government to lay in a surplus stock of wheat in casehostilities should take place in the comparatively near future.    I circulate herewith a memorandum drawn  up in the Foreign Office afterconsultation  with the Ministry  of  Agriculture and Fisheries  and  the Food(Defence Plan) Department.  This shows, I  think, that the recent large importsof wheat  into Italy may be attributed largely to the deficiency in the Italianharvest for  1936, to the depletion  of stocks  during  the sanctions period, and perhaps to some extent to a feeling on the part of  the Italian Government thatit is undesirable to take any risks in the  present uncertain state of  international relations.                                                                    A. E.    Foreign Office, January 1, 1937.                               Memorandum.    THE absence of published statistics, either official or private,  makes  itdifficult to gauge the Italian wheat situation accurately, but on the 6th DecemberSignor Mussolini announced that the 1936 crop was 20 per cent, less than thatof 1935.  The latter amounted to 7-7 million metric tons, and the 1936 crop will therefore be about 6-2 million metric tons (62 million quintals).  This figure  isindirectly confirmed  by  an official  of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, whorecently informed a member of the Embassy staff that the harvest would be in theneighbourhood of 62 or 63 million quintals.    2.  Normal consumption is from 6-6 to 7-2 million  metric  tons,  to whichmust  be added  grain for seed and unavoidable wastage, which brings the total consumption up to about 8 million  metric tons (80 million  quintals).    3.  Italy will accordingly have to import anything up to 18 million quintalsduring the current year;  although, owing to the larger  maize crop (which  is20  per  cent,  greater than that  of  last  year a year,  however,  which wasexceptionally poor) this might  be reduced to 14 or 15 million quintals.   In his despatch No. 1343 E. of the 16th December, Sir E. Drummond remarks that evenif imports of wheat  can be placed as low as  10 million quintals  the cost wouldbe not much less than 1 milliard lire.      8968   [14368]
     4.  It appears from an examination of the export figures of various countries that Italy has already imported about 11 million quintals since the 1st Augustof the present year, notably from Australia, Argentina and Canada, as comparedwith about one-eighth of  this figure during  the corresponding period  of 1935,and there is  reason  to  suppose that she may have imported between  19 and20 million quintals by next April.  This, however, would not be greatly in excessof what might have been expected, since besides the harvest deficiency estimatedabove the following  reasons  for  increased purchases  must also be  taken intoaccount:       (1) Depletion of  stocks, especially during the sanctions period;  and     (2) The desirability of taking no risks  in the present  uncertain  state  of           international relations.     5.  It seems, therefore, at least improbable that the Italians are laying in a surplus stock of wheat with a view to hostilities in the comparatively near future,and the Secretary of  the Wheat Advisory Committee takes the view  (shared bythe Minister of Agriculture and the Food  (Defence Plan) Department),  that herimports are no larger than are necessary to meet the exceptional circumstancesoutlined above.
