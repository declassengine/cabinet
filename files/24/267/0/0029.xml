THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy No. 4CP. 28 (37)CABINET.EMPIRE AIR TRANSPORT SCHEME-EXTENSION TO                     NEW  ZEALAND.              Memorandum  by  the Secretary of State for Air.    IN July  1936  the Inter-Departmental  Committee  on International  air communications considered telegraphic correspondence with the Government ofNew Zealand on their negotiations with Pan-American  Airways concerning aTrans-Pacific Air Service, and recommended that an Air Ministry official shouldbe sent out to New Zealand to advise the New Zealand Government both on thissubject and on the subject of  a Trans-Tasman Air  Service, with a view to safe-guarding United Kingdom interests.    2.   Accordingly Mr.  F.  G-  L.  Bertram, late Deputy Director of  CivilAviation, visited New Zealand in September and represented the United kingdom at Conferences in Wellington with representatives of the Governments of NewZealand and of the Commonwealth of Australia.    The agreed Resolutions of the Conference are attached as an appendix.    3.   These Resolutions were  considered in November by the  Inter-Depart-mental Committee on International Air Communications under the chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher and the following recommendations were made :         &quot; The  Committee agreed, therefore, that the Wellington  Resolutions    should, if on examination they proved to be practicable, be recommended for    acceptance by the Cabinet as soon as possible.   With  a view to this it would    be necessary to  ascertain whether Imperial Airways would  be willing to    participate in the Trans-Tasman scheme on  the basis proposed, it being    contrary to their normal policy to countenance an arrangement in which they    held a  minority interest.  It was  agreed that  the Air Ministry should    ascertain the feelings of the Company.        It was also  pointed out  that the agreement negotiated in New Zealand,    though providing for a United Kingdom contribution on an equitable basis    having regard to the volume of postal  traffic, left the United Kingdom with    an unlimited liability.  It was suggested that, having regard to the heavy    commitments in  respect of other air transport schemes, it might  be desirable    to limit this liability to  a maximum contribution.  The Committee agreed    that this question should  be  considered further.&quot;    4.   Imperial Airways Ltd. have since been consulted and have now expressedwillingness to co-operate in the proposed Company for the operation  of a Trans-Tasman Air Service.    5.   In the discussions an approximate figure  of   100,000 per  annum hasbeen taken as the amount (either as subsidy or postal  payment) required by theCompany operating the service, contributions being  provided by the Governments.of the  United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia inthe following proportions, during the first  three years  : United Kingdom 38 per       [14482]  &apos;                              &quot;...
cent., New Zealand 39 per cent, and: Australia. 23 per cent., based on the amountof mail despatched from New Zealand to  Australia and the  United Kingdomand vice versa.    ,6....,,In view of the United Kingdom&apos;s interest in securing participation withthe Governments of New Zealand and of the Commonwealth of Australia in aTrans-Tasman  Air Service,  as an  extension  of the  Empire  Air  Route  toAustralia, I now seek Cabinet approval to the United  Kingdom endorsing  theWellington Resolutions  as set out in Appendix A.    7.  This approval is sought on the understanding that the financial liabilityattaching to the United Kingdom Government  will be  related to the extent ofcarriage of United Kingdom mails on the service and to a maximum sum of (say) 50,000 per annum which can be found within the statutory  limits of subsidypayments from  Air Votes  authorised bv Section I  of the Air  NavigationAct, 1936.
