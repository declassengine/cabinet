Paper No. 1267-B.)REPORT OF AN INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL                               COMMISSION.    1.   IN accordance with the instructions of the Minister  for Co-ordinationof  Defence, the Report of the Royal Commission on the Private  Manufacture ofand Trading  in Arms has been considered by an inter-Departmental Committeeover which Sir Maurice Hankey presided, and which was attended by Sir ArthurRobinson and representatives of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Admiralty, WarOffice, Air Ministry  and the Board of Trade.   (The  composition of the inter-Departmental Committee is given in the Appendix.)    2.   On the main issue the Report of the  Royal Commission is very satis-factory in so  far as it confirms the attitude taken up by successive Governments,by the Defence Departments and by Official witnesses, that State monopoly of armsmanufacture, if not impracticable, is highly  undesirable from the point of viewof Imperial Defence and that no case for it has  been made out.    3.   It is  satisfied achny also that the Report is unanimous.  Some of the detailed recommendations, on the other hand, are less satisfactory.  To those who had to study closely  the work of the Royal Commission and the attitude of its members and to submit themselves as witnesses for cross-examination, it  is clear that theunanimity on the main  issue was only achieved by concessions  to the views of individual members, some of which are inconvenient and tend to weaken somewhatthe importance of the main decision.    4.  The  Royal Commission,  which in some other respects interpreted  its terms of Reference with a good deal of latitude, did not consider itself &apos;&apos; chargedor required to enquire into the existence of the  alleged  objections to private armsmanufacture  and trade &quot; (paragraph 92).  So far as foreign firms are concerned,the Commission  did  not attempt to form an opinion  as to whether the allegedobjections  are justified or  not  (paragraph 93).  A satisfactory feature  of theReport, however, is  that the charges of &quot;grave  objection&quot;  against  british manufacturers are described as &quot; few, and the evidence scanty &quot; (paragraph 95),and this general description is fully confirmed by the more detailed paragraphs 98to 105.  It is perhaps regrettable that the general tenor of Chapter VI, where these aspects are dealt with, is not reproduced in the summary in Chapter XII.  This,indeed, was  one  of  the most controversial  issues  in  the whole Inquiry.  the opponents of private manufacture built up a tremendous case to  prove these charges.  Their case, however, was demolished in principle and  in detail by Officialwitnesses, who showed that there had been no inquiry before, at or after the ParisPeace  Conference to justify these accusations, and  that the evidence was basedon gross  misrepresentations, exaggeration and partisan propaganda, and was supported by examples nearly all of which were shown to be false. But the official       [14470]                                                     B
evidence went further, and showed in  some  detail  that  State  monopoly,particularly if adopted internationally, would bring in its  train really  &quot;xgraveobjections &quot; and &quot; evil effects.&quot;  It is unfortunate that, except for a very scantymention in the summary of evidence in Appendix I (page 66), the Report itselfdoes not refer to this important part of the official case, which has since receivedstriking confirmation from events in the international field in general, and  inparticular from the supply of arms by or with the connivance of foreign-Govern-ments to both belligerents in the Spanish civil war.     5.  As  a  general observation on the Report as a whole, we consider that very careful scrutiny must be  given to those recommendations which tend towardsGovernment monopoly by the  strengthening of Government control.     6.  We would urge also that, in dealing publicly with the Report, ministers should  avoid  any  admission of  &quot;grave  objections&quot; and  &quot;evil  effects&quot;  byreferring to them as &quot;alleged&quot; or &quot;supposed,&quot; or by using a phrase employedby the Royal Commission itself, &quot; the evils that are alleged to exist.&quot;     7.  With this preface we turn to  the detailed conclusions and recommenda-tions summarised in Chapter  XII (page 53) of the Report.     Conclusion 1.        &quot;The most effective available means  of removing or minimising the     objections to the private manufacture of and trade  in arms would be the     limitation of arms by international agreement (Chapter III).&quot;     8.  We  agree  generally with  the  above  Conclusion  if  for  the  word&quot;objections&quot;  is substituted  &quot;the objections  that are alleged to exist&quot;; but wewould point out that the proper moment for pursuing  the limitation of arms  by international agreement must depend on wider considerations and on the general position as to  disarmament.     Conclusion 2.        &apos;&apos; The establishment of  a  universal system of State monopoly  of the     manufacture of arms is likely to be impracticable,  and in present conditions     the promotion of general State monopoly should not be a part of the policy     of this country (Chapter IV).&quot;     9.  This conclusion is in complete  accord with the policy of the government as hitherto pursued, as well as with the attitude of official witnesses.     Conclusion 3.        &apos;&apos; The abolition of the private industry in the United Kingdom and the     substitution for it of a system of State monopoly may be practicable; but it     is undesirable.   No sufficient case has  in our  opinion been made  out for     taking so drastic a step.   We believe  that the reasons  for maintaining the     private industry outweigh those for its abolition. We are of opinion that the     necessities of  Imperial Defence cannot be  effectively met, in existing con-     ditions, except by the maintenance in peace-time of a system of collaboration     between the  Government and the private  industry of the  country  in the     supply of arms and munitions (Chapter V).&quot;     10.  This conclusion is also in accord with the policy of the Government.  Asystem  of collaboration  between  the Government and private  industry  of thecountry in  the  supply  of arms  and  munitions  is  being  pursued  actively  inconnection with the programmes for reconditioning the forces.     Conclusion 4.        &quot; We recommend that public officials (whether serving or retired) should     not accept appointments with armament firms except with the approval  of     the Minister in charge of the Department in which they are serving  or have     served (Chapter VI, paras. 108-110).&quot;     11.  The  recommendation as it  stands raises difficult questions,  such as the definition  of an &quot;armament firm&quot;; the promotion of ex-officials from a  non-armaments branch  to  an armaments branch of  a firm  (eg.,  in the  &quot; shadowindustry &quot;), or acceptance of an appointment to better his position in a firm which
deals in armaments; the case of ex-officials whose Government service was of atemporary character (e.g., in the Great War); the &quot; sanction &quot; for neglect of the rule, particularly by ex-officials who have no pension.              -    This  question  forms part of  a problem  of wider  application, viz., theacceptance of appointinents by officers of the Crown Services on the terminationof their Government Service.  We are informed that the Treasury are proposing to make a report to the Prime Minister on the whole question.    Conclusion 5.        &quot; We are of  opinion that this country should continue to promote and    encourage the adoption of measures for the international regulation and    control of the manufacture of and trade in arms.  We believe that the pro-    posals to this end recently submitted to the League of Nations  by the Govern-    ment  of the United States afford a basis  on which agreement  might  be    reached (Chapter VII)    12.  This  is one  of those questions  which we had in mind  in  our recom-mendation in paragraph 5 that some of the conclusions in the Report requiredclose scrutiny, especially since there exists a marked divergence of  opinion among members of our Committee on -the subject of this conclusion.    13.  The Commission^ recommendation, so far at  least as the first sentenceis concerned, accords with the policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in thepast,  although as regards the second sentence it must be pointed out that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have not hitherto been prepared  to  accept the UnitedStates proposals in  their entirety,  taking the view that the degree of publicityinvolved and the principle of international  inspection were not appropriate to aConvention of the type contemplated, which is quite distinct from a disarmament convention properly so called.   The Foreign Office consider that this is a recom-mendation in which His Majesty&apos;s  Government  should wholeheartedly concur-On the other hand, some of us consider that its implications require most careful examination.    14.  Our previous attitude was carefully examined by Ministers and basedon their decision. The Foreign  Office now favours a step forward. On the otherhand, some of us are convinced that this would be unwise, and would even prefercautious withdrawal from our  previous position.  Circumstances are changingand when the future is so obscure, it is at least doubtful whether  it would be inthe true interests of this country to pursue a section of its disarmament policy in isolation from the problem as a whole.    15.  The point round which argument has principally revolved (and cogentarguments have  been  adduced on either side) is the question of  supply in war.We are all agreed  on the inestimable importance to this country of power topurchase war material abroad in time of war.  This question has been overlookedin the past, but it assumes great importance in the light of recent investigation into our Defence Requirements.    16.  Faced with  a  marked divergence of opinion on what  is both a verycomplex and very important subject, we have agreed, for the purpose of disposing of the Commission^  Report, upon a formula which leaves the  field open forfurther deliberation.    17.  The formula we would suggest  is that the Commission^ recommenda-tion  in the first sentence of this  Conclusion accords  with the policy hithertopursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but that whether it is wise to press thesubject of  international regulation in isolation  apart  from  the  rest  of thedisarmament problem,  especially  at this  moment,  is  a question  which HisMajesty&apos;s Government can decide only after mature deliberation.    Conclusion 6.        &quot; We recommend that the Government should assume complete responsi-    bility for  the arms  industry  in  the United Kingdom, and should organise    and regulate the necessary collaboration between the Government and private    industry;  that this  responsibility should  be  exercised through a controlling    body, presided over by a Minister responsible to Parliament, having executive    powers in peace-time and in war-time, over all matters relating to the supply    and manufacture of arms and munitions, costing  and the authorisation of    orders from abroad.[14470]
        We  further  recommend that  the  Government&apos;s  own manufacturing    establishments should be fully equipped for the production in some measure    of naval, military and air armaments of all types (Chapter VIII).&quot;    18.  This is another of those conclusions which we.had in mind in the caveatentered in paragraph 5 as to the need for careful scrutiny of certain conclusionsof the Report.    19.  The  recommendation in the first  part  of  this paragraph involves theestablishment  in peace of  an executive Minister and Ministry to take over  fromthe three Service Departments the whole of  their work of munitions supply.    20.  It is somewhat  difficult to discover  from  the  Report of  the RoyalCommission what, in their view, would be the precise scope of this new Ministerand Ministry.   They speak, for example, in paragraph 128 of control of the whole&quot;arms manufacturing  capacity of the country,&quot;  an expression  of  very  widecontent when  regard is  paid to the extent  to which the ordinary  appliances ofindustry  have been,  and can again  be,  turned to arms  manufacture.   Forinformation as to the machinery by which  this control is to be exercised theyrefer, in  paragraph 129, to  the evidence of various witnesses, but this evidenceseems rather to deal with broad policy than with the method of administration which  in this sphere is specially important.    21.  In Chapter VIII  of the Report the objects of the new Minister and ministry are defined as  being :     (1) to ensure rapidity of expansion in  emergency periods;    (2) to   check prices  and  establish   a planning  system  in  peace-time           conditions;    (3) to  prevent  the  possibility of  profiteering  in time  of war or national           emergency and  thereby to eliminate the incentive to those  grave           objections to which the system of private manufacture is  open.    22.  In so far as checking of prices in peace,  and eliminating of profit inwar are concerned, these  matters are dealt with in the comments which followregarding the  Recommendations  in paragraphs 7 and  8  based on Chapter IXof the  Report. The remainder of the case put forward for establishing a singleexecutive Minister and Ministry of Supply in peace is that this course  is essentialto proper planning for war  conditions and  to expansion to meet war needs.    23.  The  recommendation for a single executive Minister and Ministry OfSupply is,  of  course no novelty.  As  a result of  the experience of the late war there was a considerable body of opinion represented by some of the principalwitnesses before  the Royal Commission in favour of establishing a Ministryof Supply after the Armistice, though rather on grounds of economy and efficiencythan on  the ground of war planning and war  expansion  taken by the  RoyalCommission.  The  problem was  finally remitted, with others, to a  committee presided over by Lord Weir, whose terms of reference, for  the present purpose,were (C.M.D.  2649 of 1926) &quot; to make definite proposals for the amalgamation,or, if  this appears  impossible or undesirable,  for the co-ordination  as far aspossible of the Supply Departments &apos;&apos; in the Service Ministries.  Notwithstandingthese terms of reference,  the Committee reported (C.M.D. 2649 of 1926)  &quot; thatno steps  should be taken to  bring about either complete or partial amalgamation of  the supply branches of the three Fighting Services or of any section of those branches.&quot;  The Committee placed  on record, inter alia,  the views that  &quot;thecomplete amalgamation of  the Supply Departments of the three  Services intoa central Amalgamation Supply Service would diminish the efficiency of supplyof  the individual fighting Services,&quot;  that  &quot;a general pool of common stores  tomeet the needs of all three services is impracticable,&quot; and that &quot; the amalgama-tion of  the technical branches  and  inspection branches  is  unjustifiable andimpracticable.&quot;     24.  The Government accordingly decided that a single Ministry of supply in peace was not required in the public interest and  that each Service department should continue to be responsible for its own supply, with suitable arrangementsfor co-ordination as requisite, ext., through a Contracts Co-ordinating  Committee.     25.  This  decision  carried  with  it the  corollary  that  the executive responsibility for preparing for supply in war must also remain with the Depart-ments, but it was felt that in this sphere  also machinery for co-ordination was
 requisite and that in view of the importance of the issues this machinery should be  established  under the aegis  of  the  Committee of Imperial Defence.  The Principal Supply Officers Committee was accordingly set up as a Sub-Committee of the Committee  of Imperial Defence,  and there was attached to it the Board of Trade Supply Organisation to deal with raw materials, and the Supply Board with  its  various  Supply,  Machine Tools and Gauges  Sub-Committees,  each responsible for defined branches of  Supply.  Throughout there is representation of the Departments on these bodies and outside industry is also represented.  The organisation, as a whole, has been occupied for several years in  considering the war needs of supply on bases given to it by the Committee of Imperial Defence and in framing  advance plans to  meet them, and  especially  plans for war expansion in certain branches of industry.    26.  Further  developments of the organisation have been recently made by (a) the appointment of a whole time Chairman and  Secretary of the Supply Board, and (b) the appointment  of  a Minister for Co-ordination  of Defence who, as Chairman of the Principal Supply  Officers Committee, has Cabinet and Parlia- mentary responsibility for the whole work of the organisation as above described.    27.  It is submitted that the objects, assigned by  the Royal Commission as requiring for  their attainment the  establishment in peace of a single  Ministry of Supply, are being now adequately attained by the  machinery provided, and that there is thus no case on merits for the radical change suggested.  It is further submitted that such a change would be specially undesirable in the circumstances of the present time.  The Supply Departments are straining every nerve to fulfil the Deficiency Programme under strict time limits, and the change over to a new organisation would in itself involve delays which could only be faced on far stronger grounds than those adduced by the Royal  Commission.    28.  The  above observations  have  reference to   the  establishment &apos;of  an executive  Minister of Supply in peace.   It should  be added that the Principal Supply Officers Committee have  recently considered a memorandum by  the Chairman of the Supply Board on the question.whether such a Ministry will not be requisite for certain purposes in  war, and that this problem has been brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in  order  that, if such a Ministry is  approved, the necessary advance preparations may  be made for it in peace. The question has been referred to a small sub-committee for further consideration.    29.  The  second paragraph of Conclusion 6  is repeated below  for ease of reference :         &quot;We further recommend  that the Governments own  manufacturing    establishments should be  fully equipped for the production in some measure    of naval, military and air armaments of all types.  (Chapter VIII.) &quot;    This  recommendation is  expressed  at greater length in the  latter part of paragraph 130, at the end of Chapter VIII, and is advanced by the Commission as a means of planning for rapid expansion in emergency, checking of trade prices in peace, and elimination of risk of  profiteering in war.  A further reason given for this recommendation is that it  would strengthen  national defence if inter- national limitation of arms resulted in  the trade  restricting or  abandoning its present range  of manufacture (end of paragraph 130).    30.  The  scope of  the  proposal is by no means clear.  So far as vessels of Avar are concerned the Royal Dockyards build a proportion of the hulls and to this extent the recommendation is already complied with (though, of course, the structural steel materials and many components and fittings have to be purchased from the trade). But there are many items which are not made in the Dockyards, e.g., main  and auxiliary machinery, turbo generators, steering gear, capstan gear, catapults, &amp;c. Such items  are made by firms  who  are specially equipped with plant, skilled personnel, designing staff, and the knowledge and experience gained in the course of years through the medium of Naval and commercial work.    31.  It  is assumed, however, that  the Commission&apos;s. recommendation  doesnot apply to these. Obviously, to set up Government establishments to provide for the  production of all these items, even in small  quantities, would involve an enormous amount of duplication, and the overhead costs in time of peace would
 be very large.  Moreover, the expansion likely to be required in time of war can be much more readily effected, and at far less cost, by the expansion of private establishments and by their changing over from their ordinary commercial work to the production of war requirements.     32.  Again  Armour is  not  made in  a Government Establishment.   It requires furnaces for the melting of the steel in addition to big forging presses and very special plant.  Trade firms  can use the steel  furnaces and forging presses for commercial work.   Unless a Government factory had other uses than the  manufacture of  armour for these  expensive  furnaces and presses  the  cost would be high.  Moreover,  armour could not be made  satisfactorily  without obtaining  from  the  present  manufacturers  information which  they  have accumulated as the result of long  years of experiment and scientific research.     33.  Also the production of  non-transferable gun mountings requires  pits for  their erection, heavy cranes, some special  plant and other plant  which can be used for commercial work.   Messrs. VickersArmstrongs are  the only source of supply, and the Admiralty are dependent on them for working out the designs to meet specified requirements.  It would  be impossible to erect and run a new factory for  producing such mountings  without their  co-operation.     34.  Such examples could be  multiplied, and in addition  to the  difficulties referred to above there would be capital expenditure amounting to many millions of pounds.     35.  As regards aircraft, the stage of progress of the industry is a funda- mental reason against  manufacture  of machines  and engines  in  Government factories.  Such manufacture would inevitably tend to premature  standardisation of types in an industry  of  which the essential characteristic  at present,  and probably for a considerable time to come, is rapid development and improvement,. sometimes  of  an  almost  revolutionary  character.   The strongest  possible competition in design inspired by the best brains working  under  conditions most favourable  to and provocative of invention and  progress is essential to the maintenance of the highest level of efficiency.   The great number and variety of types of aircraft-engines and equipment now being manufactured by private firms  make  the  adoption  of this  particular  recommendation  a  physical impossibility.     36.  As  regards planning for rapid expansion in emergency, the policy of investigating  manufacturing  methods  and preparing process specifications  for the guidance of new contractors is already in force, notably through the Supply Board Technical  Establishment.   It applies to mass production articles rather than to the specialised equipment required by the Admiralty..  One great essential for rapid expansion of such specialised equipment is skilled labour, and a nucleus of such labour can only be maintained by placing orders with the trade.   Without orders labour would  lose its  skill and drift away to other  work.   Paragraph  130 refers to private industry being placed in emergency under a strain of  expansion not yet within its powers to fulfil.  This would, be far less within its powers if it had been starved of orders to a greater  extent than has actually taken place. The execution of the present Defence  Programme has  shewn  the tremendous importance of private industry in  helping  to meet the requirements of the three Services, and the vital  necessity of preparing it for its  task  of expansion by placing educational orders and providing it with additional machine tools, jigs, gauges, &amp;c.   Big extensions of works are now taking place in many directions, and  it would be very  difficult to justify heavy capital expenditure on new Govern-ment factories if existing capacity is sufficient to meet requirements  as far as can be foreseen.  Private industry would be all the more  important in a majoremergency which would involve the mobilisation of all the industrial resourcesof the country for the production  of war material.     37.  As  regards  checking of trade  prices in peace and elimination of riskof profiteering in war, the practice of costing has grown considerably in recentyears and will be applied still more in connection with the Defence Programme.For  example,  the makers  of non-transferable  gun  mountings,  armour  andhardened shell give all facilities the Admiralty consider necessary to enable themto satisfy themselves that the prices to be paid  are  reasonable. In  war timelegislation would give the necessary powers to control prices and profits and
investigate books.  Government factories would provide an additional check on prices, but the value of this check in the circumstances referred to is regarded asa matter of comparatively secondary importance.    38.  Government manufacture already extends to a wide range of armamentsin addition  to the construction of warships in the  Dockyards, e.g:, guns, high explosive shell, fuzes, &amp;c, at Woolwich, Naval cordite at Holton Heath, Torpedoesat Greenock, but its  extension to armaments  of all types is  considered to be impracticable.    39.  The question of extending the range of Government manufacture is onewhich must be considered on the merits of each case, with due regard to economy,adequacy of existing trade facilities, and  the possibility of  maintaining theGovernment plant and workers, unsupported by the commercial side to the workwhich, in the case of private trade,  often  keeps the resources in  being whenService requirements are few, and puts commercial technical developments at thedisposal  of the Services.    40.  For the above reasons we  do not recommend the  adoption of either ofthe recommendations in Conclusion 6.    Conclusion 7.         &apos;&apos; We  recommend that measures be  taken to restrict the profits of    armament firms in peace-time to a reasonable scale of remuneration, designed    not  only to prevent excessive profits, but to satisfy the public that they do    so (Chapter IX).&quot;    41.  Reference to the text of the  Report does not give  much help as to whatthe Commission have in mind; indeed, they  say          &quot; We  do not propose to  undertake the task of formulating  specific    methods for  the  restriction of profits  in  peace-time.   No doubt  it  is one    fraught  with technical difficulty.  We  have taken no evidence that would    afford us a basis for the consideration of the problems involved, and we are    not a suitable body to advise on  these problems.&quot;They  do, however, indicate that  they do not think the problem of controllingpeace-time profits can be  solved by the Defence Departments  satisfying them-selves  &apos;&apos; that the profits  allowed to  private  manufacturers under particularcontracts are fair and reasonable.&quot;   They point out that their proposals would bring the &apos;&apos; control of prices within the purview of  the body ....  suggested &apos;&apos;in the first part of Conclusion 6, and seem to envisage that body instituting some system  of  control   which  would  prevent excessive  profits  on  armamentsmanufacture  IS ct whole.    42.  The &quot; Statement Relating to Defence,&quot; Cmd. 5107, says (paragraphs57-59) :  &quot; His  Majesty&apos;s Government are  determined that the  needs of thenation shall not serve to pile up extravagant  profits for those who are called uponto meet them.....On the other hand, it is important to retain the goodwill ofindustry, for in peace-time firms cannot be compelled to undertake contracts on terms  which they consider unreasonable. . . . .   tlis  Majesty&apos;s government believe that  all these difficulties can be overcome through the organisation theyhave  in  mind.  ....  Control to prevent  excessive profits will  be effectivelyexercised by inspection of books, adequate technical costings, audits on behalf ofthe State and arbitration in cases  of dispute. The Government  are satisfied thatthis can  be done without impairing the confidence and enterprise of contractorsundertaking novel and difficult tasks.&quot;    43.  If  some new central body  such as  is recommended by the commission were to be established and to become the sole contracting department for armamentorders, this machine, operating, as it no doubt would  do, the  present arrangementsfor the fixing of  prices, could no doubt be  presented as a complete or at leastadequate fulfilment of  Conclusion  7,  though in fact its  powers would be  no greater than  those of individual Departments, and  there would still remain the substantial difficulty, that control of prices on individual contracts is not sufficientby itself  to ensure that firms do not  make profits which the  public will regard asexcessive. A series of contracts, each of which fixes prices allowing for the lowestmargin of profit that can be negotiated in peace-time,  may cumulatively produce a
most inflatory effect on a firm&apos;s balance sheet.   But. the fundamental difficultyhere is that indicated in some of the extracts given above from the White Paper.It is not possible in peace-time, under present  conditions at any rate,  to forcefirms to take contracts at prices which they do not regard as showing a reasonableprofit..  A department negotiating a repeat contract can to some extent take intoaccount the yield from a  previous contract.   The  Treasury  have urged that in fixing prices regard should be had to the effect of the  contract price upon thebalance sheet.  The Contract Departments have pointed out the limited extentto which  they can apply  this canon: it is  not at all obvious that a single department would be in any stonger position in this respect than  are the three departments acting alone but in concert.    44.  The reply to be given to this Recommendation, therefore, depends in alarge measure on the reply  to Conclusion  6.   The establishment of a  central department controlling contracts with the arrangements already announced mightdispose of recommendation 7 for the time being.  If there is not to be a central department, it is suggested that for the present it would be sufficient in replyto point to the assurances in the White Paper, to the arrangements  already madein each Contracting Department for controlling prices and to the arrangementsfor co-ordination through the Treasury Inter-Service  Committee, the ContractsCo-ordinating Committee and the well-established practice  in the ContractingDepartments of keeping each other informed when any one of  them places, oris contemplating placing, contracts with a firm with which any other is  dealing.There  still remains the  substantial likelihood  that  the   balance  sheets  ofcontractors (and still more of sub-contractors) will show greatly enhanced profits,and that further measures may be needed to keep  profits within &apos;&apos; reasonable &apos;&apos;bounds. It  is not, however, at all obvious that the centralization proposed by theRoyal Commission would be of the least efficacy  to this end.    Conclusion 8.        &quot; We are  of opinion that the problems involved in formulating plans    for the conscription of industry in war-time  will have to be faced, and should    be faced without delay.  (Chapter IX.) &quot;    45.  The question  of  how far  what is called conscription of industry isdesirable and practicable in war time  is one  of  the issues raised by the detailedenquiry on  the Control of Profits and Prices which was conducted by  a Sub-Committee of the Contracts  Co-ordinating Committee at the instigation of thePrincipal  Supply Officers Committee.   The report, together with the comments ofthe Advisory  Panel of Industrialists thereon,  is  now  being examined  by  theDepartments concerned prior to  its submission to the  Committee of ImperialDefence. It is recognised that, as in the last war,  a much wider measure of controlover industry will be needed in war than in peace and work has been proceedingfor some time on the measures necessary.    Conclusion 9.        &quot;We are of opinion that the administration of the system of licensing    exports of arms should be governed by  an outlook different  from and more    positive in character than that which now  prevails; that licences should be    granted only to such firms as shall have been specifically authorised to accept    orders for export  by the controlling body  already  recommended; that  the    grant of  licences  should by  restricted  to  orders by  foreign  governments,    supported by import licences issued by those governments which shall state    that the goods will not be re-exported.        We recommend that the  practice of issuing  open general licences  for    the export of  certain classes of  arms,  &amp;c, be&quot; discontinued;  that specific    licences be required in all cases;  and in particular that a rigid  control be    exercised over all exports of aircraft, whether  classified  as military or civil    (Chapter X).&quot;    46.  This recommendation falls into four parts, viz.-     (i) that the system of licensing exports  of  arms &apos;&apos; should be governed by an          outlook different from and more positive in character than that which          now prevails&quot;;
     (ii)  that  licences  should  be  granted only to  such firms as shall have been          specifically authorised to accept orders for export by the &quot; controlling-          body &quot; referred to in Recommendation  6;    (iii)  that  the  grant of licences should be  restricted  to  orders  by foreign          Governments, supported by  import licences issued.by those Govern-          ments, which shall state that the goods will not be re-exported;     (iv)  that  the  practice of issuing  open general licences for certain classes          of  arms,  &amp;c, be discontinued; that specific licences be required in          all  cases; and in particular that a rigid control be exercised over all          exports of aircraft, whether classified as military or civil.    The  grounds on which these various recommendations are put forward are set out in Chapter X of the Report.    47.  A  Nation like the United Kingdom, which is a small military power in peace, but may  need to become a large one in a war a  position in which wediffer from every other great Power in the world except possibly  the UnitedStates of America must foster an export trade in armaments (subject to propersupervision) in order to maintain its productive capacity : for productive capacitycannot be equated with idle plant.  This is  the  fundamental fact which  mustgovern our arms export policy so long  as armaments are unrestricted  and war apossibility.  Temporarily, it is overshadowed by our reconditioning programme,but it is there.    It is, therefore, impossible  to  accept  the argument which the Commissionadvance in paragraph 148 of their Report that the nucleus of productive capacityclue to the export  trade is so small that it is not worth while to  encourage itsgrowth, and that  its  reduction  or  disappearance are matters  of indifference.The nucleus is certainly small, but this is a matter for apprehension  rather than for satisfaction  (as  even public  opinion is now beginning to realise) and it isimportant that every legitimate encouragement  should be given to its growth.    This does not mean that  His Majesty&apos;s Government are seeking to increasethe world trade in  arms. It means that His Majesty&apos;s Government  are interestedin British firms securing a share of such trade  as inevitably takes place so long-as some nations  are unable in whole or in part to  manufacture the war materialnecessary for their own self-defence.   The dangers of this  trade to world peacehave been much exaggerated.   The issue, peace or war, lies with the great Powers,who for the most part manufacture their own armaments.    48.  It follows  that, provided proper  supervision is exercised, the exportlicensing machinery should be such as to minimise  interference and delay : other-wise British firms  will merely lose legitimate  trade to their foreign competitors.When the  Commission refer  to  &quot;a  more  positive outlook &quot; they mean &quot; theabandoning of  the  existing  policy under which licences are granted in theabsence of a specific arid compelling reason for refusing them and the substitution of a policy under which it is made a part of the duty of the official authorised togrant licences, acting upon grounds specifically authorised by the controlling bodyrecommended in Chapter VIII,* to satisfy himself in each case that there is needfor granting a licence taking all considerations into account &quot; (paragraph 149 ofthe Commission^ Report).  This amounts to  a  proposal that the question to bedecided as regards any particular application  for an export licence should be notwhether there  is any objection to the proposed export, but whether it  is actuallydesirable.   This principle would  entail for  the Department responsible for advising  the  licensing  authority,  and  particularly  the Foreign   Office,  anexceedingly difficult and delicate appreciation of other people&apos;s business (the other people being foreign Governments) : it  may  be observed that in circumstances which call for the  exercise of especial discretion, e.g., at times when an embargois in force, the export licensing system already affords His Majesty&apos;s Governmentall the powers of control it needs.    The  suggestion implicit in the Commission^  proposal, i.e., that insufficientsupervision is  at present exercised, cannot be accepted even as fair comment, andthe Commission adduce no evidence to prove it.  As regards control over the exportof arms this country is second to no other a  view only too clearly confirmed bythe present situation in regard to arms for Spain.       * The question of this controlling body has been discussed under Conclusion 6       [14470]                                                       c
  -   49:   So far, therefore, as  the  Commission^  recommendation. under sub- head (i)  stresses the need for proper supervision over the grant of export licences, we concur : but the implied criticism of the Departments responsible for advising the licensing authority cannot be accepted, for it is based on a fundamental, mis- conception of  the  role of the Arms Export Trade in our system of  National Defence.     50.   As regards sub-head (ii),  the  Commission^ recommendation  doubtless derives from its strictures on the  present operation of the licensing system.   These have been considered in paragraphs 47-49 above. It is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by superposing  a general authorisation of firms upon the particular authorisation (by  licence) of their exports.  All manufacturers and dealers in arms are already registered under the provisions of the Firearms Act.     51.   As regards sub-head (Hi), it was explained in the official evidence given by  the Board of Trade to the Royal Commission (paragraph 26 (2) ) that-   &quot; the  general practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to issue licences for the     export of  war material only to Governments or to the  accredited agents of     Governments for delivery to  them.   In  the  case  of  material for testing     purposes,  samples for demonstration or exhibition, or accessories, reputable     firms may  be accepted&apos;as consignees.&quot;     The Arms Export Prohibition Order also covers, in addition to war material, personal weapons, industrial explosives anclunarmed aircraft.  Here the general practice of confining the issue of export licences to Foreign Governments naturally does not apply, but applications in respect of small arms and small arms  ammunh tion  to  which  any suspicious circumstances attach, always receive  very close scrutiny^ while the export of aircraft of  military type to undesirable destinations is prevented by administrative measures of control.* Thus the practice actually adopted  by the licensing authorities  goes a very.long way towards  realising the Commission^ intention.     Where, as  is generally the case,  a foreign Government is itself the purchaser of war material, it is difficult  to, see what purpose would be served  by requiring an  import licence  from that Government.  Actually, import  authorisation  by Governments was provided for in the 1925 Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms  and Ammunition, which, though  ratified (subject to a reservation) by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  failed to come into force owing to lack of ratifications by other Governments.  A certificate that arms imported by  a  foreign Government are not intended for re-export is not required even  by the 1925 Arms  Traffic Convention.  We consider that the policy, hitherto adopted in this matter should be maintained, viz.;, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not require import authorisations or. any special certificate unless and until this is provided for in  an international agreement accepted by  the  other supplying countries.  We desire to emphasise the fact that the  result of imposing on British firms any restrictions. which are  not  imposed on their  foreign competitors is  to place the  former at a disadvantage, and to  encourage the transfer of  trade elsewhere where it will probably  not be under such strict control, and will benefit the productive  capacity, not of ourselves, but of some other country.    52    With regard to sub-head (iv), the classes of material at present covered by Open General Licences are (a) aircraft, assembled or dismantled,  and aircraft engines;   (b)  bayonets,, swords  and lances;   (c)  smooth-bore  shotguns  and ammunition for use therewith; (d) certain explosives used either  in the manufac- ture  of  shotgun  cartridges or for industrial purposes,  and  (e) fire-arms and ammunition covered by a United  Kingdom fire-arms  certificate/when exported by the holder of the certificate.  (The Open General Licences covering items (a) to (d) do not apply in the case of export to certain defined geographical  areas.)    53.   In the case, of items  (c), (d) and  (e), it is  clearly undesirable  that thehampering requirement of specific licences should  be introduced; on the  other    * If Our recommendation in paragraph 56 below is  adopted, the  existing  administrativecontrol over military aircraft will, in  future, be supplemented by the requirement of a specificexport licence.          :         ,                     . . ...   -
 hand, complete decontrol would seem inadvisable.  Accordingly, we  recommend that the existing Open General Licences should be maintained in respect of these items.     54.  The item  (6),  &quot; bayonets,  swords  and  lances,&quot;  is  of insignificant importance from the point of view of export, and  these goods  could  without difficulty be made subject to specific licences.     55.  As regards item (a),  &quot;aircraft,&quot; we have carefully considered  the possibility of meeting the Royal Commission^ recommendation.  We feel that the application of this  recommendation to civil aircraft would  give rise to real hardship  such as, in  our view,   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  should  not,  by unilateral action, impose upon civil flying in this country.  We would point nut, however, that in the event of any danger arising that civil aircraft  may be exported from this country in an emergency for military purposes,  there is power to revoke the Open General Licence in respect of any aircraft or any  country concerned.    56.  As regards military  aircraft, we have reached the  conclusion that the export of these could,  without  any serious disadvantage, be subjected to  the requirement of specific  export licences, subject to administrative details  being- worked out  in  consultation  between  the  Departments concerned,  and  we recommend that action should be taken on these lines.  Aircraft engines, however, should, we consider, continue to be subject to Open General Licence.     It should be added that the Customs are advised  that  under existing law they have no power to refuse clearance to or to detain aircraft leaving this country under their own  power on the ground  of  non-production of an export licence. This matter is now under consideration. Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870.    57.  In paragraph  152 of the Report the Royal Commission recommend,  in effect,  the  extension to  aircraft of the terms of Section  11  of the   Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870, which applies to naval or military expeditions.  In 1925 the Law Officers advised that this Section might apply to an  expedition  of aircraft fitted with armament, such as  guns,  bombs,  &amp;c, but that an unarmed aircraft could not constitute a military expedition.  An amendment of  the Act would be necessary to bring unarmed aircraft within its terms,  and it would be advisable at the same time to  place it beyond  doubt  (doubt being evidently not excluded by the terms of the advice  of 1925) that armed aircraft are covered also. No disadvantage (on the contrary, definite advantage) is seen in such an extension of the Act of 1870.  It might take the form of enabling His Majesty by Order-in- Council to apply to aircraft all or any of the provisions of the  Foreign Enlistment Act. Such an enabling power was provided for in a &quot; Foreign Enlistment Bill &quot; drafted in 1914, and reconsidered in 1922, the main object of  which was to bring the Act of 1870 into line with the  Neutrality Convention of  1907. The Bill  in question was not  proceeded with, for reasons unconnected with the provision  in regard to aircraft.                  ...    58.  It would be necessary to make it clear in any provision that it  applied only where the aircraft was fitted out or despatched with the intent or reasonable belief that it was to be used for hostilities.    The question whether in any amendment of the Act provision should be made, as in Section 2 (2) of the Treaties of Washington Act,  1870, for a presumption  ofoffence against a corporation^ officers, is one which should be carefully considered in connection with the suggested legislation.    Conclusion 10.         . .        &apos;&apos; We recommend the complete  cessation of the private  export trade  in    surplus and second-hand arms and munitions of war.   (Chapter XI.)  &quot;    59.   In the evidence offered  to  the Royal Commission it was suggested that,apart from such financial advantage as there may be in these sales, it is desirable&apos;on military and  general  grounds,  if a  foreign Government cannot afford  topurchase newly-manufactured  arms in  this  Country, that  it should purchasesurplus British arms rather than go abroad for its supply.  The Commission donot refer to this evidence in their report.  And in such cases there is (contrary to      [14470]        -                                             c 2
the suggestion of the  Commission) some advantage  to  manufacturers  in  thiscountry, in that orders for ammunition and spare parts may  be attracted.   on purely  departmental grounds, there would seem  to be no sufficient reason  forabandoning the present  practice,  but if,  for  political  reasons, it is thought desirable to do so, it is not considered necessary to hold out against that view,provided that the rule is not regarded as  absolute, but  can be waived  in very special  cases.  It might, for example, be desirable to allow the.sale ef accessoriesto a shipbuilding firm, which, otherwise might not be able to obtain them so soon,and,  consequently,  might lose  the  order for the ship.  If  the.  Commission^recommendation is adopted, it  would  still  be permissible to carry out sales of surplus munitions direct to foreign governments, though experience has suggestedthat in  many cases there are difficulties in carrying through  negotiations by thismeans.                          SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS.    60.  Our Conclusions are summarized below : (a) General.         We recommend that, in dealing publicly with the Report of the Royal    Commission, care should be taken to avoid any admission  of &quot; grave objection    to &quot; or &quot; evil effects of &quot; private manufacture of or trade in arms.   If it is    necessary to refer to the subject these terms might be preceded by the words    &apos;-&apos; alleged &quot; of &quot; supposed &quot; or resort might be made to a phrase used in the    Report of the Royal Commission, viz.,  &quot; the evils that  are alleged to  exist    (paragraphs 4 to 6).(b) Conclusion 1 (Chapter III).         The Conclusion  of the Royal Commission, that limitation  of arms by    international  agreement would remove or minimise  the  objections to the    private manufacture of and trade in arms, is generally agreed with,  subject    to the substitution of the term &quot;  the objections that  are  alleged to  exist &quot;    for the word &apos;&apos; objections &apos;&apos;  ; but it is pointed out that the  time for  pursuing    this policy and the question of pursuing it in isolation must depend on wider    considerations and the general position as to disarmament (paragraph 8).(c)  Conclusion 2 (Chapter IV).         This conclusion  on  the impracticability of  the  establishment of  a    universal system  of  State  monopoly for the manufacture of  arms is in    complete accord with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government  as hitherto    pursued (paragraph 9).(d) Conclusion 3 (Chapter V).         The view that the abolition of the private industry is undesirable is also    in  accord with the  policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  A system of    collaboration between the Government and Private Industry of the country    in the  supply of arms and munitions is  being pursued actively in connection    with the programmes for re-conditioning the forces (paragraph 10).(e)  Conclusion 4 (Chapter VI).         The acceptance of appointments with armament firms by public officials    forms  part  of  a  problem  of  wider application,  viz. : the  acceptance of    appointments by officers of  the Crown  Services on the termination of  their    Government Service.   We are informed that the Treasury are proposing to    make a report to the Prime Minister on the whole question (paragraph 11).(f)  Conclusion 5 (Chapter VII).         The  Commission^  recommendation in  the  first&apos;  sentence  of   this    Conclusion  accords with the  policy hitherto pursued by His Majesty&apos;s    Government.  Whether  it  is wise to  press the  subject of  international    regulation in isolation apart from the rest  of  the  disarmament  problem,    especially at this moment, is a question which His Majesty&apos;s Government can    decide only after mature deliberation (paragraphs 12-17).       ..v .,.
(g) Conclusion 6 (Chapter  VIII).         The first part of this conclusion involves the establishment in peace of    an  executive Minister  and Ministry to take over  from the three Service    Departments the whole of their work of munitions supply.  It is considered    that the objects of this recommendation are now adequately attained by the    machinery provided by the  Principal Supply Officers Committee  Or-ganiza-    tion of the Committee of Imperial Defence, under the Chairmanship of the    Minister for Co-ordination of  Defence, and that there is no case on merits    for the radical change suggested.         Nor is it considered that the second part of this recommendation,  i.e.,    that Government manufacturing  establishments should be fully equipped    for the production in some measure of armaments  of all types,  should be    adopted.  Government  manufacture  already  extends to a wide range of    armaments in addition to  the  construction of warships in Dockyards,  but    its extension to armaments of all types  is impracticable (paragraphs 18-40).(h) Conclusion 7 (Chapter IX).         The reply to be given to this recommendation depends in a large measure    on the reply to  Conclusion  6.  The establishment of a central Department    controlling contracts, together  with the measures already announced in the    &quot; Statement relating to Defence &quot; Cmd. 5107, might dispose of the question    of the  restriction of profits of armament firms for the time  being, though it    is not at all obvious that the centralization proposed by the Royal Commission    would  be of the  least  efficacy in  keeping profits  within &quot; reasonable &quot;    bounds.  If there is not to be a central  Department, it is suggested that for    the present it would be sufficient for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in reply to    point to the assurances in the White Papers and to the arrangements already    made for controlling prices and co-ordination  through the  Treasury Inter-    Services Committee and the  Contracts  Co-ordinating Committee  (para-    graphs 41-44).(i) Conclusion 8 (Chapter IX).         It is recognised that, as in the last war, a much wider measure of control    over industry will  be  &quot;needed  in  war  than  in peace,  and woi.*k has been    proceeding for  some time on the measures necessary (paragraph  45).(j) Conclusion 9 (Chapter X).         (i) We are unable to advise acceptance of the proposal that the licensing    of arms exports should be governed by  an outlook different  from,  and more    positive  in character than, that which now pr-evails : for  we believe this    recommendation to  be  based on a misconception of the role of the Arms    Export Trade in our system of National Defence.         (ii) It is difficult to see what  useful purpose would be served  by super-    posing  the  authorisation  of  particular  firms  to export  arms  upon  the    authorisation (by licence) of their  exports.         (iii) It is already the general practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to    confine the grant of licences for war material to orders by  foreign govern-    ments  (with certain  strictly limited exceptions), and we consider that His    Majesty&apos;s Government should not require import authorisations stating that    the goods will not be re-exported unless and until this is provided for in some    international convention accepted by all other exporting countries.         (iv)  We recommend that the existing Open General Licences  should be    maintained in respect of- 1             Smooth-bore shot-guns and ammunition for use therewith.             Certain  explosives used  either  in  the manufacture  of shot-gun        cartridges, or for industrial purposes, and             Eire arms and ammunition covered by a United Kingdom&apos;Fire Arms     , .&apos;.  Certificate, when exported  by the holder of the  Certificate.    Bayonets, swords and lances are of insignificant importance from  the point    of view of export, and these; goods could without difficulty be made subject to    specific licences-        ---                                          ...
2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,      January 22, 1937.        As regards civil aircraft it is  felt that  the  application of the Royal    Commission^ recommendation would give  rise to real hardship  such as,    in our view, His  Majesty&apos;s Government should not,  by unilateral action,    impose upon civil flying in this country. As regards military  aircraft we    have reached the  conclusion that the export of  these could, without any    serious  disadvantages, be  subjected to the requirement of  specific export    licences, subject to administrative details being worked out in consultation    between the Departments concerned, and we recommend that action should    be taken on  these  lines.   Aircraft  engines,  however,  should, we consider,    continue to be subject to Open General Licences (paragraphs 46-56).        (v)  No disadvantages are seen in an extension  of the Foreign Enlistment    Act of 1870  to cover aircraft (paragraph 57-58).(k)  Conclusion 10 (Chapter XI).        On purely Departmental grounds there would seem to be no sufficient    reason for abandoning the sale of surplus and second-hand arms and munitions    of war to  foreign Governments by private agency  under proper  safeguards,    but if for political reasons it is thought desirable to do so, it is not considered    necessary  to  hold out against that view, provided the rule is not  absolute    and can be waived in very  special cases (paragraph 59).

(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1267-B  and 1299-B.)    (Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of  the 264th Meeting, Minute 16.)    THE  COMMITTEE had under  consideration  the Report of the  RoyalCommission on the Private Manufacture of and. Trading in Arms (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1267-B), and the Report of an Interdepartmental Committee on the Reportof the Royal Commission (C.I.D. Paper No.  1299-B).    SIR MAURICE HANKEY introduced the Report of the interdepartmental committee  at the request of  the Chairman, and explained that the Departmentsconcerned had been  working on this Report  for a long time.  To those who had given evidence before the Royal Commission and had followed carefully  theproceedings of that body, it  was  obvious  that  the unanimity of the  RoyalCommission on the main issue had only been achieved by concessions to the viewsof individual members.    The  conclusions of  the  Interdepartmental  Committee were summarised onp. 12 of their Report.  In conclusion (a)  a suggestion had been made that if itwas necessary.to refer publicly to the &quot; grave objections to &quot;  &quot; evil effects of &quot;private manufacture of  or trade in  arms,  these terms might be preceded by  thewords &quot; alleged   or &quot; supposed,&quot; or resort might be  had to a phrase used inthe Report  of the Royal Commission, viz. ; &quot; the evils that are alleged to exist&quot;The Royal Commission had not declared itself as to whether the alleged objectionsto private manufacture and trade in arms existed or  not.    From the summary  of  conclusions of the Interdepartmental  Committee&apos;sReport it would be  seen that  out of ten conclusions  of the  Royal Commission,the Committee had  only been  able to recommend the acceptance (and even thissubject to some very minor qualifications) of three, namely :     Conclusion 1.        &apos;&apos; The most effective  available means of removing  or minimising  the    objections to the private manufacture of and trade in  arms would be  the    limitation of arms by international agreement.&quot;    Conclusion 2.        &quot; The establishment of a universal system  of State monopoly of  the    manufacture of arms is likely  to  be impracticable  and  under  present    conditions the promotion of general State monopoly should not be a part of    the policy of this country.&quot;    Conclusion 3.        &apos;&apos; The abolition of the private industry in the United Kingdom and  the    substitution for it.of a system of State monopoly might be practicable; but    it is  undesirable.  No sufficient case has, in our opinion, been made out  for      [14517-1]                                                   B
     taking so drastic a step.   We believe that the reasons for  maintaining the     private industry outweigh those for  its abolition.  We are of opinion, that     the  necessities of Imperial Defence  cannot  be effectively met, in existing     conditions, except by the maintenance in peace-time, of a system of eollabora-     tion between the Government  and the private industry of the country for     the supply of arms and munitions.&quot; Certain  conclusions were not yet considered to be quite ripe  for decision.   For example, conclusion 4, which read as follows            &apos;&apos; We recommend that Public Officials (whether serving or retired) should     not  accept appointments with  armament firms, except with the approval of     the Minister in charge of the Department in which they are serving or have     served.&quot; This was part of a  wider problem, namely, the  acceptance of appointments by officers of  the Crown Services  on  the  termination of their Government Service, which was under examination  by the Treasury.   There was no strong objection to this proposal except that its application would involve certain difficulties. Conclusion (a).     THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed          To accept the  conclusions of the Interdepartmental  Committee on the     four recommendations of the Royal Commission^ Report referred to above,     which are as follows :           &quot; (i)  Conclusion 1 (Chapter III).             The Conclusion of the Royal Commission, that limitation of  arms         by international agreement would remove or minimise the objections to         the private manufacture of and trade in arms, is generally agreed with,         subject to the substitution of  the term &quot; the objections that are alleged         to exist&quot; for the word &quot;objections &quot;;  but it is pointed out that the         time for pursuing this policy and the question of pursuing it in isolation         must depend on wider considerations and  the general j)osition as to         disarmament.         (ii) Conclusion 2 (Chapter IV).             This conclusion on the impracticability of the establishment of a         universal system of State  monopoly for  the  manufacture of arms  is in         complete accord with the policy  of His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  as         hitherto pursued.         (iii) Conclusion 3 (Chapter V).             The view that the abolition of the private industry  is undesirable         is  also in accord with the policy  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  A         system of collaboration between  the Government and  Private Industry         of the country in the supply of arms and munitions  is being pursued         actively in connection with the programmes for reconditioning  the forces.         (iv) Conclusion 4 (Chapter VI).             The acceptance of appointments with  armament firms  by public         officials forms part of a problem of wider application, viz., the accep-         tance  of appointments  by  officers of the Crown  Services,  on  the         termination of their  Government Service.   We are informed that the         Treasury are proposing to make a report to the Prime Minister on the         whole question.&quot;     SIR MAURICE HANKEY then  referred to conclusion 5 (Chapter VII) ofthe Royal Commission^ Report, which was as follows :          &quot; We are of opinion that  this country should continue to promote and     encourage the adoption of measures for the international regulation and     control of the manufacture of and  trade in  arms.   We believe that the
     proposals to this end recently submitted to the League of Nations  by  the     Government of the  United States of America  afford a  basis  on  which     agreement might be reached.&quot;     The Interdepartmental Committee had found this the most difficult conclusion to deal with.  Whilst there was general agreement that the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendation accorded with the policy  hitherto pursued by His  Majesty&apos;s Government, difficulty has been encountered  in reaching agreement  as  to  the action to be recommended to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.  The Foreign Office on the one hand considered that this recommendation should be followed up by action at the Bureau of the  Disarmament Conference at  Geneva, where they would like to announce  reconsideration of our  objections to the United  States proposals for the regulation of arms manufacture and trade in arms.                   (Mr.  Ormsby Gore arrived at this point.)     The  other  Departments  represented on  the  Committee,  however,  more especially the  Admiralty, Air  Ministry  and  himself,  were  opposed  to  any extension of the international regulation  of control of the  manufacture of and trading in arms.  They considered that the action already taken in this direction had damaged a country such as ours, which depended on sea power, by stimulating both national and international control, so that  in the event of war we might, even now, be unable to obtain indispensable requirements from abroad.     Sir Maurice gave examples of  the vast amounts of munitions purchase not only from the United States of America, but from Switzerland during the Great War.  The experience gained with  our armaments programme showed that in a future major war  we should still be heavily handicapped if we were unable to purchase abroad.  Sea-power gave us that inestimable advantage, but we would not use it if Governments controlled exports too closely.  Continuing, he said that in the circumstances he and  the Service Departments considered that it was desirable to call a halt, and although it was recognised that it might be politically impossible to reverse our  past policy, we could at least mark time and, if possible, avoid discussion of this one side issue of  disarmament apart from disarmament as a whole.   He (Sir Maurice Hankey) had only secured  the limited agreement to this question by giving an undertaking to the Service Departments that he would draw the specific attention of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to this controversy with  a view to securing that the  Foreign Office should take no action at Geneva until the Government had decided on their policy.  In these circumstances the Interdepartmental  Committee had recorded the  following conclusion :          &quot; The  Commission^  recommendation  in  the  first  sentence of this    conclusion accords with the policy hitherto pursued by  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-    ment.  Whether it is wise to press the subject of international  regulation    in isolation, apart from the  rest  of the disarmament problem, especially at    this  moment,  is a question  which His Majesty&apos;s Government can decide    only after mature deliberation.&quot;    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN asked how this matter was to be dealt with.    THE CHAIRMAN  considered that this was for the Committee to decide. The  question could either be referred  to the Cabinet for decision, or else, in the first  place; to a Committee of Ministers.    After discussion it was agreed that conclusion 5 (Chapter VII) of the Royal Commission^ Report should be fully discussed  forthwith by the Committee of Imperial Defence in order to obviate  a further examination by a Committee of Ministers.    In reply to  Mr. Chamberlain, SIR MAURICE HANKEY explained thatour previous difficulty regarding the American proposals referred to questions of supervision and inspection, and full publicity of  manufacture and orders.  Withthe rest of their proposals submitted to the  Bureau in November 1934, we were more or less in agreement.  A system of control now existed in most countries.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE asked how far the United States of America pro-posals would compromise our power to buy abroad in the event of war.  In hisopinion the  more control was introduced,  the more it would be  regarded  as  anunneutral act to supply munitions to this country.       [14517-1]  &apos;                           &apos;                   B  2
     SIE MAURICE HANKEY said that it was the intention that every country should have  a system of licensing: machinery, and  that  all orders should be reported to an international body at Geneva.   In his opinion elaboration of the controlling machinery in peace would make it more difficult to obtain a relaxation of that control in  war.  Although it was provided that the system could be terminated in  war  at the instance of a belligerent,  the existence of elaborategovernmental and international  machinery of control, and  the resulting creationof a watchful public opinion would make  Governments very cautious aboutlicensing exports of war material and tend towards a narrow interpretation of neutrality.     THE CHAIRMAN remarked that this would depend on how this machinery was  operated in war.  He quoted from paragraph 118 of  the Royal Commission^Report, in which it was stated that  the U.S.A.  Draft Articles  provided, amongst other things, for international supervision.  Paragraph  123 of the same Reportalso  stated that one of the difficulties in the way of acceptance by this country ofthese Draft Articles related to the machinery of supervision proposed.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE said  that,  whilst it would be difficult to go backon a policy previously pursued over a period of years, we ought to be much cleareras to what was meant  by the Royal Commission^ recommendation before thiscountry took  the initiative in  pressing  for  acceptance of  the United  states proposals at  Geneva.     LORD SWINTON said  that the question of international control of tradein arms was only a part of  the generah disarmament problem.   Whilst  it wasagreed that  it was desirable to have a  proper licensing  system  for arms,  thegeneral question of  disarmament was hardly in the picture at the moment.  Theonly way the question of international control could come up in a practical formwould be to put up this question in isolation.  The risk did not lie in the adoptionof a  licensing system by all countries, but in the fear that the export of materials of which munitions  were manufactured might  be prohibited.   Any  measureleading to a hostile neutral opinion on this point would be bad for this country.     MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said he was  quite  prepared  to agree to a system of licensing control, but not to a system of supervision and  inspection.  He did notconsider we should  advance beyond our previous attitude  on  the United  states proposals.     Mr. Chamberlain then referred to paragraph 126 of  the Royal CommissionsReport, which read  as follows :          &quot; We believe that the principles  that lie behind the United States Draft     Articles  command a wide measure of support abroad, and that the Draft     Articles afford a basis on which  an agreement for the  international regulation     and control of  the trade  in  arms might be reached.  We  recognise that the     realisation of these proposals would be of less value than an international     agreement for the limitation of arms, and that they involve restrictions  that     may be unwelcome or may be thought to be excessive for the limited purposes     in view.   But we nevertheless think that the possibility should not be missed     of securing international agreement in the  domain of arms control even on a     limited scale.&quot;He considered the arguments in  the above-quoted paragraph to be  weak.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE said it was essential to avoid any new issue, andthat it was open to us to interpret paragraph 126 as we wished.     MR.  CHAMBERLAIN  suggested  that,  if this question was raised inParliament, we should announce  that we were prepared to accept  the 1934 UnitedStates of  America  draft Articles for the  international  control  of the trade in arms as a basis of discussion;  refer to our difficulties in regard  to these proposals;and  adhere to our attitude previously expressed.  .   SIR MAURICE HANKEY understood that the Foreign Office wished topress ahead with this question.     SIR ROBERT VANSITTART  said that the  Foreign Office  would like totake the initiative, and they would like to be able to say that we should be preparedto agree if&apos;other people did; but that they felt fairly  sure  that other  people would not. &quot;
    THE CHAIRMAN  said  that  it  seemed clear  that the attitude  of theCommittee to conclusion 5 (Chapter VII) of the Royal Commission^ Report wasthat it was  undesirable for His  Majesty&apos;s Government to take  the  initiative.He considered that the action in Parliament in regard to this conclusion suggestedby Mr. Chamberlain should be placed on record.Conchision (&amp;)&apos;.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed -    (1)  That if the question of international  control of  the trade  in arms,          referred to  Conclusion 5  (Chapter VII) of the Royal  Commission^          Report, was raised  in Parliament, the general line to be  taken  by          Ministers should be as  follows :                 It should be stated  that  the proposal of the Royal Commission          corresponded with the policy hitherto adopted by this  country  in          regard to the international regulation and control of the manufacture          of and trade in arms; that we were prepared to take the draft Articles          submitted by the United States  of  Anerica  to the  Disarmament          Conference  in 1934 as a basis of discussion; that reference should be          made to our difficulties in regard to these draft Articles, and that we          should adhere to our attitude as previously expressed :    (2)  that we should  avoid taking any initiative in this matter at  Geneva.    THE COMMITTEE  then  dealt with Conclusion 6 (Chapter  VIII) of theRoyal Commission&apos;s Report.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that Part I of this Conclusion read  asfollows :          &apos;&apos; We recommend that the Government should assume complete responsi-    bility for the arms industry in the United Kingdom and should organise    and regulate the necessary collaboration between the Government and  private    industry; that this responsibility should be  exercised through a controlling    body, presided over by a Minister  responsible to Parliament, having the    executive powers in peace-time  and in war-time, over all matters relating    to the supply and manufacture of arms and munitions,  costing and authorisation- :    tion of orders from abroad.&quot;The Interdepartmental Committee recommended  the rejection of  the first partof the Conclusion on the ground that the  present organisation of the Governmentwas adequate.  The second part of this Conclusion was          &quot;We  further recommend   that Governments   own  manufacturing    establishments should be  fully equipped for the production in  some measure    of naval, military,  and air armaments of all  types.&quot;Rejection of  the second part of  the Conclusion was  also recommended.  Thetechnical objections to these proposals had been developed at length in the Inter-departmental Committee&apos;s Report.  This proposal would involve the Air Ministrysetting up works not only  for one, but for every major type of aircraft.    SIR  SAMUEL HOARE,  whilst  agreeing with the  interdepartmental committee&apos;s Conclusion, said that any statement in the House should not be toodogmatic on the question of a Ministry of Supply, and it  should not be implied that this was  an irrevocable decision for all time.    LORD SWINTON said that  the Royal Commission^ recommendation couldonly be carried  out by establishing a  Ministry of Supply.   It was not possible toleave contracts in the hands of Service Departments and at the same time have a&quot;Minister with over-riding powers.  He suggested, at any  rate, we should takethe line that  either the Service  Departments or a Minister of Supply should  beresponsible for  supply.   It was not  possible for a Minister to dictate the termsof contracts to be executed by other Departments.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN agreed  in  substance with the Inter-departmentalCommittee&apos;s Conclusion.  He said it would be necessary to make the advocates ofthe Royal Commission^ Conclusion  prove that  the system proposed would  be
more efficient than our present system.  Priority questions were being settled inour present organisation.  He referred to the objects of  the new Minister  and ministry, which were defined by the Royal Commission as being :      &quot; (i)  To ensure rapidity of expansion in emergency periods;     (ii) To check prices and establish a system in peace-time conditions;     (iii) To prevent the possibility of  profiteering in time of war or national           emergency,  and  thereby  to  eliminate the incentive  to those  grave           objections to which the system of private manufacture is open.&quot;Every reasonable  effort was now being taken to prevent  excessive  profits, and he did not see what other  action could be taken.  It was,  of course, impossible tocontrol commercial work in peace-time.     SIR MAURICE HANKEY  said  that there was  every reason  for  beingcautious over this question, as we would probably require a Ministry  of supply in War.    THE CHAIRMAN referred to paragraph 129 of  the Royal Commission^Report, which stated that many interesting and instructive proposals in regardto the machinery  of Government control had been made to them by witnesses of expert knowledge and wide experience.   He had studied  the evidence  of the witnesses in question and found  that their proposals for State control related toa war-time organisation, whereas the recommendation in the Royal Commission^Report dealt with a  peace-time Ministry.  He considered  that the conclusion ofthe Interdepartmental Committee should be accepted; but,  as this was not a finalexpression  of  opinion of what  might ultimately be necessary,  the  Conclusionshould be qualified by the addition of the words  &quot; in present circumstances.&quot;Conclusion (c).    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed          To accept  the Conclusion of  the  Interdepartmental  Committee  on    Conclusion 6 (Chapter VIII) of the Royal Commission^ Report, amended    as follows :          &quot;  The first part of this Conclusion involves the establishment in peace    of an executive  Minister  and Ministry to take over from the three Service    Departments the whole of their work of munitions supply. It is considered    that the objects of this recommendation are now adequately attained by the    machinery provided by  the Principal Supply Officers  Committee Organisation    of  the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence, under  the  chairmanship of the    Minister for  Co-ordination of Defence, and that there is no  case on merits    for the radical change suggested in present circumstances.         &quot;Nor is it considered  that the second  part of this recommendation,    i.e., that Government manufacturing establishments  should be fully equipped     for  the provision  in some measure of armaments  of all types,  should be    adopted.  Government manufacture already extends to  a  wide range of     armaments in addition to the construction of warships in  dockyards, but its    extension  to armaments of all types is impracticable.&quot;     THE COMMITTEE considered Conclusion  7  (Chapter IX) of  the  RoyalCommission^ Report, which read :-         &quot;  We  recommend   that measures  be taken to restrict  the  profits of    armament firms in peace-time to a reasonable scale of remuneration designed    not only to prevent excessive profits but to satisfy the public that they do so.&quot;     SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that the Royal Commission did not suggesthow this could be done. A great deal  was already being done, and  the  Inter-departmental Committee suggested  that it should be sufficient for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to point to  the assurances of the White Paper and the arrangementsalready made for controlling prices and  securing  co-ordination through theTreasury Inter-Service  Committee and  the  Contracts  Co-ordinating Committee.     THE CHAIRMAN said that  the  Chancellor of  the  Exchequer was  doing;what was possible to control profits.
    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN considered we should point to the assurances of theWhite Paper and the arrangements already being made.   It would not be possibleto indicate that we had found a way of &quot; taking profits out of war.&quot;Conclusion (d).    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed          To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Committee on Con-    elusion 7  (Chapter IX) of the Royal  Commission^ Report  which  is  as    follows : -         &quot;The reply to be given to this  recommendation depends  in a  large    measure  on  the  reply  to Conclusion 6.   The  establishment of  a central    department  controlling  contracts,  together  with  the  measures already    announced in  the &apos; Statement  relating to Defence&apos; (Cmd.  5107),  might    dispose of the question of the restriction of profits of armament firms for the    time being, though it is not at  all obvious that the  centralisation proposed    by the Royal Commission would be of the least efficacy in keeping profits    out of &apos; reasonable &apos; bounds.&quot;         &quot;If  there is to be a central department  it is  suggested  that for  the    present it would be sufficient for His Majesty&apos;s  Government in reply to point    to the assurances in the White Papers and to the arrangements already made    for controlling prices and co-ordination through the  Treasury Inter-Services    Committee and the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.&quot;    THE COMMITTEE considered Conclusion 8 (Chapter IX) of the RoyalCommission&apos;s Report which read :          &quot; We are of  opinion that the problems involved  in formulating  plans    for the conscription,of industry in war-time will have to be faced and should    be faced without delay.&quot;    SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that &quot;conscription of industry&quot; was an extreme term.  It was almost approved in principle at one stage of the late war,  but not carried into -effect.   This question was only part of a detailedenquiry on the &quot; Control of  Profits and Prices,&quot; carried out by a Sub-Committeeof the Contracts  Co-ordinating Committee.   Their  Report had been referred tothe Advisory  Panel  of  Industrialists and was now being examined depart-mentally, prior to submission to  the  Committee of Imperial Defence.Conclusion (e).    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed.          &quot; To accept  the Conclusion  of  the  Interdepartmental  Committee on    Conclusion 8 (Chapter  IX)  of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report which  reads    as follows :          &quot;It is recognised  that, as  in the last War, a much wider measure of    control over industry will be needed in war than in peace, and work has been    proceeding for some time on the measures necessary.&quot;    THE COMMITTEE considered  Conclusion 9 (Chapter X) of the  RoyalCommission&apos;s Report which read :           &apos;&apos; We are of opinion that the administration of the system of licensing    exports of arms should be governed  by an outlook different from and more    positive in character than that which now prevails; that licences should be    granted only  to such firms as shall have been specifically authorised to accept    orders for export by the controlling body already  recommended;  that  the    grant of  licences should be restricted to  orders by foreign Governments,    supported by import licences issued by those Governments which shall state    that the goods will not  be re-exported.         &apos;&apos; We recommend that the practice of issuing open general licences for    export of certain classes of arms, &amp;c, be discontinued; that specific licences    be required in all cases; and, in particular, that a rigid control be exercised    over all exports of aircraft, whether classified as military or civil.&quot;
    SIR SAMUEL HOARE asked what was in the mind of the Royal Commis-sion when they recommended that licences should be granted only to such firms asshall have been specifically authorised to accept orders for  export.  Did it mean that a Government would  have  to take a decision  which side they intended toencourage ?  This recommendation tended  towards the destruction of neutrality,and there was a danger that  countries would be driven to support one  side orthe other.                                      ...    SIR HORACE HAMILTON said that it was difficult to fathom what theRoyal  Commission had in  mind when putting forward this recommendation.There was  no suggestion that  the present licensing system was not water-tight.Every application went to the  Board of Trade and was examined by the ForeignOffice and the Service  Departments concerned.   It  was difficult  to  see how anyother machinery could be devised and also difficult to see how we could agree withthe Royal Commission^ suggestion.  As  regards a suggestion that the exporttrade could be ignored,  the figures for the export of arms and munitions of UnitedKingdom manufacture  amounted to  3-1 million annually, of which approximatelyhalf went to Empire countries.  In reply to questions, he stated  that this figuredid not include the figures  for export of ships or aircraft.    ME. CHAMBERLAIN was  of opinion that the Royal Commission,  havingreported against State  manufacture, were  now trying to explain  that there were other ways of getting rid of the alleged objections  to private manufacture.  Atpresent the tendency was  not  to  refuse the export  licences  unless there was anadequate reason. Under the Royal Commission^ recommendation, licences wouldnot be given  unless there was some definite reason for a  certain licence.   TheRoyal Commission appeared to want to make it as  difficult  as possible for firms.to export arms.   He could not  endorse the change of attitude  referred to inparagraph 149 of the Royal Commission&apos;s  Report.    THE CHAIRMAN remarked that the Royal Commission^  suggestion thatthe official authorised to grant licences should satisfy himself in each case thatthere was a need for granting  a licence would be very difficult to carry out.    LORD SWINTON considered that the effect  of this  Conclusion would  be toprevent foreign countries placing orders in this country.Conclusion (/).    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed :           To accept the  Conclusion of the  Interdepartmental  Committee  on    Conclusion 9 (Chapter X) of the Royal Commission^ Report  which reads as-    follows :         &quot; (i)  We are  unable  to advise acceptance of  the proposal that the               licensing of arms exports should  be  governed   by  an  outlook               different from, and  more positive in character than, that which               now prevails; for we believe this recommendation to be based on               a misconception  of  the role of  the  Arms Export Trade in our               system  of National Defence.         (ii)  It is  difficult to  see what  useful  purpose  would be  served by               superposing the authorisation of particular firms  to export arms               upon the authorisation  (by licence) of their exports.         (iii)  It is already the general  practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to-               confine the grant of licences for war  material to orders by  foreign               Governments (with  certain strictly  limited  exceptions), and we               consider  that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  should  not  require               import  authorisations   stating  that  the   goods will  not  be               re-exported  unless  and  until  this is provided for in  some              I international  convention   accepted  by   all  other  exporting   .            countries.         (iv)  We recommend that the existing Open General Licences  should be-               maintained in  respect of-                   Smooth-bore shot-guns and ammunition for use  therewith.                   Certain explosives used either  in the manufacture of  shot-               gun cartridges, or for industrial purposes, and
                    Fire  arms and ammunition covered by a United Kingdom                Fire  Arms Certificate, when  exported by  the holder . of the                Certificate.                Bayonets, swords and lances are of insignificant importance from                the.point  of  view of export,  and  these  goods could without                difficulty be made subject to specific licences.                    As regards civil  aircraft,  it is felt that the application of             &quot;  the Royal Commission^ recommendation would  give rise to real                hardship such as, in our view, His Majesty&apos;s Government should                not, by unilateral action, impose upon civil flying in this country.                As regards military aircraft, we have  reached the conclusion that                the export of these could,  without any serious disadvantages, be                subjected to the requirement of  specific export licences, subject to                administrative  details being worked out in consultation between                the Departments concerned, and we recommend that action should               be taken on these  lines.  Aircraft engines, however, should, we               consider, continue to be subject to Open General Licences.         (v) No disadvantages are seen in an extension of the Foreign Enlistment               Act of 1870 to cover aircraft.     THE COMMITTEE considered  Conclusion 10 (Chapter XI) of the Royal Commission^ Report which read :           &quot; We recommend the complete cessation of the private export trade in     surplus and second-hand arms and munitions of war.&quot;     SIR MAURICE HANKEY explained that the  Service Departments  were not in favour of accepting  this recommendation, nor did they  think that  their evidence had been taken  fully into account  by  the  Royal  Commission.  If, however, for political reasons, it was  thought desirable, the Inter-Departmental Committee did not consider it necessary to hold out against the view that the sale of second-hand and  surplus arms and munitions  by  private agency should be abolished.    MR, CHAMBERLAIN said  he was  not  much in favour of the Royal Commission^ Conclusion.   Firms manufacturing arms  for the British Govern- ment always carried certain stocks.  When patterns changed  and stocks became obsolete, it was necessary that firms should be able to dispose of them; otherwise the tendency would be for firms to keep smaller  stocks, to our disadvantage.  At first sight he did not see any political reasons for holding out against the view of the Service Departments.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY explained that the War Office transactions had been made through the Soley Armament Company, who had apparently made a bad impression on the Royal Commission.    MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said he would be  prepared to agree to the Inter- Departmental Committee&apos;s  recommendation if  the last line  were  amended to read as follows :         &quot; and can be waived in special cases,&quot; i.e., deleting the word &quot; very.&quot;    LORD  SWINTON said that the stocks referred to  by  Mr.  Chamberlain could be sold in the ordinary way by manufacturers.  He was of the opinion  thatthe Royal Commission intended to deal with surplus or  second-hand arms.    SIR MAURICE HANKEY was of  opinion  that the Royal  Commissionintended to deal with second-hand arms surplus  to our requirements.    LORD SWINTON said it should be made clear  that this recommendations should only apply to a trading  company who bought and sold arms, and not to manufacturers who might  be holding surplus stocks.   He did not consider  thatany resolution should be adopted which would preclude us from supplying arms to foreign countries, which action was in many cases desired by the Foreign Office.

     MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that the War Office transactions with the  Soley  Armament  Company  were  apparently the  cause of  the  Royal Commission^ concern.     MR. DUFF COOPER said that no surplus or second-hand arms could be exported except under licence: Conclusion (g).     THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed          To  accept the  Conclusion  of the Inter-Departmental  Committee  on     Conclusion 10 (Chapter XI) of the Royal Commission^ Report as amended     by Mr. Chamberlain, and which is as follows.:-          &quot; On purely  Departmental grounds there would seem to be no sufficient     reason for  abandoning the  sale  of surplus  and second-hand  arms and     munitions of war to foreign Governments by private agency  under proper     safeguards, but if for political reasons it is thought desirable  to do so, it is     not considered necessary to hold out against that view, provided the rule     is not absolute and can be waived in special cases.&quot;     THE COMMITTEE finally considered whether any further meeting should be held on the Royal  Commission^ Report, and it was agreed that it should be left  to  the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to  refer  this matter to the Cabinet and that no further meeting of Ministers was  necessary. Conclusion (h).     THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE  agreed         That the  Report of the Inter-Departmental  Committee on the Report     of  the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture  of and Trading  in     Arms (C.I.D. Paper No. 1299-B), together with these Minutes, be submitted     to the Cabinet by the Minister for Co-ordination  of Defence.     For convenience   of  reference  the  Conclusions  recorded in  the  aboveproceedings are reproduced below :                               CONCLUSION  (a).     THE COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE  agreed         To accept the conclusions of the Interdepartmental Committee  on the     four recommendations of the Royal Commission^ Report referred to above,     which are as follows :         &quot; (i) Conclusion 1  (Chapter III).            The Conclusion of the Royal Commission that limitation of arms        by international agreement would remove or minimise the objections to        the private manufacture of and trade in arms is generally agreed with,        subject to the substitution of the term &apos; the objections that are alleged        to exist&apos; for  the word &apos; objections,&apos; but it is pointed out that the time        for pursuing  this policy and the question of pursuing it in isolation must        depend  on  wider  considerations  and  the  general  position  as  to        disarmament.         (ii)  Conclusion 2 (Chapter IV).            This conclusion on the impracticability of  the establishment of a        universal system of State monopoly for the manufacture of arms is  in        complete accord with the policy of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  as        hitherto pursued.        (iii)  Conclusion 3 (Chapter V).            The view that the abolition of the private industry is undesirable        is  also in accord with the policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government.   A        system of  collaboration between the Government and Private Industry        of the  country in the supply of arms  and munitions is being pursued        actively in connection with the programmes for  reconditioning the forces.
11218    (iv) Conclusion 4 (Chapter VI).            .  .- .      .. -. , ,  .,  .;:   ,::The acceptance of appointments  with armament firms by public    officials forms part of a problem of wider application, viz., the accep-    tance  of  appointments by  officers of  the  Crown  Services  on  the    termination of their  Government Service.   We are informed- that the    Treasury are proposing to make a report to the Prime Minister on the    whole  question.&quot;                          CONCLUSION (b).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed (1)  That if the question of international control of the trade in  arms,      referred to in Conclusion 5 (Chapter VII) of the Royal Commission^      Report, was raised in Parliament, the general line to be taken by      Ministers should be as follows :             It should be stated that the proposal of the Royal Commission      corresponded with  the policy hitherto  adopted by this  country in      regard to the international regulation and control of the manufacture      of and trade in arms;  that we were prepared to take the draft Articles      submitted by  the United  States of America  to  the Disarmament      Conference in 1934 as a basis of discussion; that reference should be      made to our difficulties in regard to these draft  Articles, and  that we      should adhere to our attitude as previously expressed  -(2)  that we should  avoid taking any initiative in this matter at Geneva.                          CONCLUSION (C).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     To  accept  the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental  Commission on conclusion 6 (Chapter VIII) of the Royal Commission&apos;s  Report, amended as follows : -    &quot; The  first part of this Conclusion involves the establishment in peace of an executive Minister and Ministry to take over from the three Service ;Departments the whole of their work of munitions supply.  It is consideredthat the objects of this recommendation are now adequately attained by themachinery provided by the Principal Supply Officers Committee Organisationof  the Committee of  Imperial  Defence,  under  the  chairmanship  of  theMinister for Co-ordination  of Defence, and there is no case on merits forthe radical change suggested in  present circumstances. .    &quot;Nor  is it considered  that  the second part of  this recommendation,i.e., that Government manufacturing establishments should be fully equipped for the  provision  in some measure of armaments of  all  types, should beadopted.    Government manufacture already extends to a  wide range ofarmaments in addition to the construction of warships in dockyards, but its extension to armaments of all types is impracticable.&quot;                          CONCLUSION (d).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Committee on Con-clusion  7   (Chapter IX)  of the  Royal Commission^  Report which is asfollows : -    &quot;The  reply to be given to this recommendation depends  in  a large measure on the reply to Conclusion 6.   The  establishment of  a  central department controlling  contracts, together  with the measures  already announced  in  the&apos; &apos; Statement relating to Defence&apos;  (Cmd. 5107), mightdispose of the question of the restriction of profits of armament firms for thetime being, though it is not at all obvious  that the centralisation proposedby  the Royal Commission would  be of the least  efficacy in  keeping profitsout of &apos; reasonable &apos; bounds.&quot;                            V  1  [14517-1]    \.                                             D
     &apos;&apos; If  there is to be  a central department it is suggested that for the present it would be sufficient for His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to point to the assurances in the White Papers and to the arrangements already made for controlling prices and co-ordination through the.Treasury Inter-Service Committee and the  Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.&quot;                          CONCLUSION .(0). THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed      &quot; To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental  Committee on Conclusion 8 (Chapter IX) of the Royal Commission^ Report which  reads as follows :      &apos;&apos; It is recognised that, as in the last War,  a much wider measure of control over industry will be needed in war than in peace, and work has been proceeding for some time on the measures necessary.&quot;                          CONCLUSION (/).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed :      To  accept the  Conclusion  of the  Interdepartmental Committee on conclusion 9  (Chapter X) of the Royal Commission^ Report which reads asfollows :      &quot; (i) We  are unable  to  advise  acceptance of the  proposal  that  the          licensing  of arms  exports  should   be governed by  an outlook          different from, and more positive in character than, that which          now prevails; for we  believe this recommendation to be based on          a  misconception of the role of  the  Arms  Export  Trade in our          system of National Defence.     (ii)  It is ,difficult to see what useful purpose would be served  by super-          posing the authorisation (by licence) of their exports.    (iii)  It is already the general practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to          confine the grant of licences for war material to orders by foreign          Governments  (with certain  strictly  limited exceptions), and we          consider  that  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  should not require          import authorisations stating   that  the  goods  will not  be          re-exported unless and until  this is  provided  for  in  some          international   convention   accepted  by   all. other  exporting          countries.    (iv) We recommend that the existing Open General Licences should be          maintained in respect of                Smooth-bore shot-guns and ammunition for  use therewith.               Certain explosives used either in the manufacture of  shot-          gun cartridges, or for  industrial purposes,  and               Fire  arms and ammunition  covered by a United  Kingdom          Fire  Arms Certificate, when  exported by the holder of the          Certificate.          Bayonets, swords and lances are of insignificant  importance  from          the  point of  view of  export, and these  goods could without          difficulty be made subject to specific licences.               As regards civil aircraft, it is felt that the application of          the Royal Commission^ recommendation would give rise to real          hardship  such as, in our view, His Majesty&apos;s- Government should          not, by unilateral action, impose upon civil flying in this country.          As. regards military aircraft, we have reached the conclusion that          the export of  these&apos; could, without any serious disadvantages, be          subjected to the requirement of specific export licences, subject to          administrative details being worked out in consultation between          the Departments concerned, and we recommend that action should          be taken  on these lines.   Aircraft  engines, however, should,  we          consider, continue to be subject to Open General  Licences.    (v)  No disadvantages are seen in an extension of the Foreign Enlistment          Act of 1870 to cover aircraft.
13211                         CONCLUSION (g).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     To  accept  the Conclusion  of the Inter-Departmental Committee on conclusion 10 (Chapter XI) of the Royal Commission^ Report as amended by Mr. Chamberlain, and which is as follows :-    &apos;&apos; On purely Departmental grounds there would seem to be no sufficient reason for abandoning  the  sale  of surplus and  second-hand arms  and munitions of war to foreign Governments by private agency under proper safeguards, but if  for political reasons it is thought desirable to do so,  it isnot considered necessary to hold out against that  view, provided  the  rule is not absolute and can be waived in special cases.&quot;                         CONCLUSION (h).THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed     That the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Report ofthe Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms(C.I.D.

As a preliminary observation it is interesting to note that the Royal Commission express with one ex^ception only negative conclusions concerning what theydescribe as the &quot;alleged evils1&apos; of private manufactureof and trade in arms. -  Chapter II, which deals to  someextent with this subject, is confined to a brief summaryof the evidence on either side of the controversy..Later on (Chapter VI) the Royal Commission point outthat they were        &quot;not charged or required to inquire         into the existence of the alleged         oh j e o ti ons&quot;0  (Pa ra.92)They proceed, however, to set out &quot;the alleged evils&quot;and in paragraphs 93 - 103 state conclusions that Sonot affirm their existence.  The exception is dealtwith in Conclusion 4 to which I will refer later.     It is satisfactory to note that the  charges oi  &quot;graveobjection&quot; against British manufacturers are described as&quot;few, and the evidence scanty&quot;-&apos;  (Parao 95).       This confirms the vie?; which has more than once been expressed by different Governments since  the \?ar0       So far- as foreign firms are concerned the RoyalCommission had no means of forming an opinion as to whetherthe alleged objections were justified or not, and do not attempt to do so.

! CONCLUSION  1.Internaltional(Limita-tion ofArmSo     The main results of the Inquiry are set forth in tenpropositions in Part VIII on page 53 of the Report, and. theattitude of the Government can most easily &quot;be explained bydiscussing these in turn.     The first Conclusion  is as followss--            &quot;The most effective available means         of removing or minimising the objections         to the private manufacture of and trade         in arms would be the limitation of arms         by international agreement&quot;0     T,7e agree generally with  this  Conclusion,,     To quote the body of  the Report -            &quot;the limitation of  armaments by             international agreement seems  to             us to provide by far  the most             important and potentially  effective             means of obviating the possibilities             of abuse that are  said to  be inherent             in the system of private manufacture             of and trading in  arms&quot; (?arae  55)%the main reasons being - to quote  the Report once more -that            &quot;the potential evils to which it is             liable depend ultimately on the             possibility of seeking private             profit in an expansible market&quot;             (Para. 36 )0     Unfortunately3 however, international  agreement forlimitation of armaments is at the present moment submergedaNevertheless it remains an essential part of the peacepolicy of the Government,,   Within the  last year it hasbeen pursued persistently., and  with a certain measure ofsuccesss in the sphere of naval armamenta9  and we are continually on the look-out for any opportunity that mayoffer to renew our efforts in a wider fieldsILLUSION 20,/iTe MonopolyT&apos;pi&apos;acticableoThe second Conclusion of the Royal Commission is as follows      &quot;The establishment of a universal system of       State monopoly of the manufacture of arms       is likely to he impracticable and in       present conditions the promotion of general      State monopoly should not be a part of the       policy of this country.   (Chapter IV. ).&quot;
r                    This was the firstaeul the most important issue               committed to the Royal Commission, and their Conclusion               accords with the general policy of this, as of previous               Governments.,   The experiences through which we are               passing at the present time in the re-conditioning of our               Defence Services, no less than the studies and preparations               we have made for the contingency of a major war, confirm               the view of the Royal Commission that a State monopoly of               manufacture is Impracticable.,CONCLUSION 3.         Conclusion 3s-Abolition of               &quot;The abolition of the privatePrivate Industry            Industry in the United Kingdomundesirable.                and the substitution for it of                           a system of State monopoly may                           be practicable;  but it is                           undesirable.    No sufficient case                           has in our opinion been made out                           for taking so drastic a step.                           We believe that the reasons for                           maintaining the private industry                           outweigh those for its abolition,                           We are. of opinion that the necessi--                           ties of Imperial Defence cannot be                           effectively met, in existing condi-                           tions, except by the maintenance in                           peace-time of a system of coliabora-                           tion between the Government and the                           private industry of the country in                           the supply of arms and munitions.                           (Chapter V,)&quot;                    This Conclusion, which is in the nature of a               corollary to Conclusion 2, is also in complete accord               with the policy and practice of the Government.               Collaboration in fact between the Government and private               industry in the supply of arms and munitions is being -               pursued continuously in connection with the programmes               for re-conditioning the forces.   The Royal Commission               suggest (para. 127) that  the collaboration that is needed               is the regulation and control by the Government of the               private industry.  As will appear later in my statement,               we are not able to accept that recommendation in present               circumstances.
       On the main issue, therefore, which is dealt within the three Conclusions already quoted, it is satisfactory to find complete agreement between the Government and  theRoyal Commission.       The remaining Conclusions of the Report deal with questions which, though important, are subsidiary to themain question.jHGLUSION. 4.opointments ofiblic Officialso have Minister-al Approval.        Conclusion 4  is as follows:-           &quot;We recommend that public officials            (whether  serving or retired)  should             not accept appointments with             armament firms except with, the             approval of the Minister  in  charge             of the Department in which they             are serving or have served.  (Chapter             VI.)&quot;        The actual application of this recommendation  is  not so easy as appears at first sight.   It raises difficult questions, such as the definition for  this purpose  of  an&quot;armament firm&quot; -- all firms manufacturing armaments  inthis&quot; country manufacture other articles as well  - as well  asthe definition of a &quot;public official&quot;  (e.g., does it include those whose service was of a temporary character?),  and asto the sanction for non-observance of  the rule,  particularly by ex-officials who have no pension.        The subject forms part of a problem of widerapplications namely,  the acceptance of appointments  by officers of the Crown Services on the termination of their government service, which is being enquired into by  theTreasury.-OHGLUSIOM 5;Encouragement ofInternationalRegulation andControl of theManufacture ofand Trade in arms.Conclusion 5:-   &quot;We are of opinion that this country     should continue to promote and encourage     the adoption of measures for the inter-     national regulation and control of the     manufacture of and trade in arms.    We     believe that the proposals to this end     recently submitted to the League of
          Nations by the Government of the          United States afford, a basis on which          agreement might be reached. (Chapter VII.)&quot;       The promotion and encouragement of measures for international regulation and control of the manufacture of and  trade in arms have long formed part of the policy of this  country.   It is a policy which has to be pursued cautiously;  for example, due regard must be had:-          &quot;to the&apos; necessities of those            Members of the League which            are not able to manufacture            the munitions and implements            of war necessary for their            safety&quot; (Article 3 of the            Covenant).       In the Great War it was found that we ourselves,  and all our Alliess  fell into this latter category.    We could not manufacture anything like the whole of our needs, but, thanks to British sea-power, we were able to avert disasterby purchasing armaments abroad.    Our inquiries into our defensive needs do not encourage the expectation that in a future war either we or any of our allies can rely on being- independent of foreign supplies.    We must therefore be on our guard against increasing the difficulties in making purchases abroad in time of war which already exist owing to stricter interpretations of neutrality.   Restrictions onpurchases, if carried too far,  tend to weight the scales infavour of nations which are ready to sacrifice all other considerations to piling up their armaments in peace  against
the contingency of war.       There was a good, deal in common betweenthe proposal submitted to the League of Nations bythis Government and that of the United States,  though there were also one or two points of difference inwhich we still prefer our own solution.  We should^however,  be prepared, whenever the question comes tothe front, to accept the draft Article submitted bythe United States of America to the DisarmamentConference in 1934, as a basis of discussion.       The subject of international regulation andcontrol of the manufacture of and trade in arms is part of the larger question of Disarmament as awhole.   The moment at which it can best be taken upcan only be decided in agreement with the League ofNations and the other countries concerned..SIGN 6.iment Responsi- for the Armsry exercisedh a Control-ody presidedy a Minister.       Conclusion 6 is as followss-          &quot;We recommend that the Government X            should assume complete responsibility            for the arms industry in the United            Kingdom, and should organise and            regulate the necessary collaboration            between the Government and private            industry;  that this responsibility            should be exercised through a con-            trolling body,  presided over by a            Minister responsible.to Parliament,            having executive powers in peace-time            and in war-time, over all matters            relating to the supply and manufacture            of arms and munitions,  costing and the            authorisation  of orders from abroad.           We further recommend that the Government&apos;s            own manufacturing establishments should            be fully equipped for the production in            some measure of naval,  military, and air            armaments of all types.  (Chapter VIII.)&quot;      The recommendation in the first part of theConclusion involves the establishment in peace of an executive Minister and Ministry to take over from thethree Service Departments  the whole of their work ofmunitions supply,
                                                   .   218      It  is  somewhat difficult  to  discover from  the Reportwhat  would  he  the precise scope of  this new Minister  and ministry,   For example, in paragraph 128 the RoyalCommission  speak of control of the  whole &quot;arms  rn.anufac.tur-ing capacity of the country&quot; - an expression of very  widecontent when regard is paid to the  extent to which theordinary appliances of industry have been, and  can again be, turned  to  arms manufacture.      The recommendation for a single executive  Ministerand Ministry of Supply is, of course, no novelty, and hasoften been  discussed in this House.   After the late war there was a considerable body of  opinion - represented by some of  the principal witnesses before the RoyalCommission - in favour of the establishment of  a Ministryof Supply.   The problem was finally remitted,  with others to a  Committee, presided over by  Lord Weir,  whose Termsof Reference (Cmd.  2649 of 1926)   included the following:-      &quot;To malce definite proposals  for the amalgamation,        or, if this appears impossible or undesirable,        for the co-ordination as  far as possible of        the Supply Departments in the Service        Ministries&quot;.The Committee reported:-      &quot;.No steps should be taken to bring about either        complete or partial amalgamation of the supply-        branches of the three  Fighting Services or of        any section of those branches&quot;.The Committee placed on record, inter alia,  the views that      &quot;The complete  amalgamation of the Supply Departments        of the three Services  into a central Amalgamation        Supply Service would diminish the efficiency of        supply of the  individual  Fighting Services&quot;;that -      &quot;a general pool of common stores to meet the needs        of all three Services  is   impracticable&quot;,and that -      &quot;the amalgamation of the  technical  branches and        inspection branches is unjustifiable  and        imprac t impracticable&quot;.
     The Government of the- day accordingly decided that a single Ministry of Supply in peace was not required in the public interest, and that each Service Department should continue to be responsible for its own supply, with suitable- arrangements for co-ordination as requisite, e,g, , through a Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.     This decision carried with it the corollary that the executive responsibility for preparing for supply in war must also remain with the Departments, but, in order to secure co-ordination in this matter, machinery was estab- 11shed under the aegis of the Committee of Imperial Defence This included the Principal Supply Officers Committee, attached to which were the Board of Trade Supply Organis- atlbft to deal with raw materials, and the Supply Board, with its various Supply, Machine Tools and Gauges Sub- Committees, each responsible for defined branches of supply The organisation has since teen occupied in considering the war needs of supply on bases given to it by the &apos;Committee of imperial Defence, and in framing advance plans to meet them, and especially plans for war expansion in certain branches of industry.    Recent developments of the organis- ation have included     (a)   The appointment of a whole-time Chairman and            Secretary of the Supply Board, and     (b)   The appointment of a Minister for Co-            ordination of Defence, who, as Chairman            of the Principal Supply Officers Committee,.            has Cabinet and Parliamentary responsibility            for the whole work of the organisation above            described.     v?e consider that the objects assigned by the Royal Commission as requiring for their attainment the establish-ment in peace of a single Ministry of Supply are being now adequately attained by the machinery provided, and. that at the moment there is no case on merits for the radical change suggested.
     I do not wish to he too dogmatic on this subject,and am prepared to reserve the Government&apos;s attitude inthe future, &quot;out at the moment, when the Supply Depart-ments are straining every nerve to carry out the deficiency Programme under strict time limits, thechange-over to a&quot; new organisation would, in our opinion,involve delays which could only he faced on far strongergrounds than those adduced by the Royal Commission.   Ireserve also entirely the question of whether a&apos; Ministerand a Ministry of Supply may be necessary in time ofwar.     The recommendation that the Government&apos;s own manu-feeturirig establishments should be fully equipped forthe production of some measure of naval, military andair armanents of all types is one that we cannot adopt.     Of course, nany forms of armaments are already con-strueted in the Royal Dockyards and manufacturingestablishments, &quot;but a very long list can be given ofarticles manufactured by firms which are speciallyequipped for their manufacture with plant,  skilled per-sormel, designing staff, and the knowledge and experience gained in the course of years through the medium ofGovernment and commercial work.   To provide for theproduction of all these items, even in small quantities,would involve an enormous amount of duplication, andthe overhead, costs in time of peace would be very large.Moreover, expansion in time of war can be much more rapidly effected, and at far less cost, by the expansionof private establishments and by their changing-over
from their ordinary commercial work to the pro-duct ion of war requirements.   Many examplescould he given, hut it is perhaps sufficient to mention the case of aircraft.   The stage of progress of this industry is a fundemental reasonagainst the manufacture of machines and enginesin Government factories.    Huch manufacture would inevitably tend to premature standardisation of types in an industry of which the essential charaeter-istic at present,  and probably for a considerable time to come,  is rapid development and improvement,sometimes&apos; of an almost revolutionary character.The strongest possible competition in design -inspired by trie best brains working under con-cl.itions most favourable to and provocative ofinvention and progress -  is essential to the main-tenance of the highest level of efficiency.   Thegreat number and variety of types of aircraftengines and equipment now being manufactured by private firms makes the adoption of this particularrecommendation a physical impossibility.
     One of the reasons given in the Report for this 9 9  jrecommendation was &quot;To establish a planning system inpeace-time conditions&quot;?  (Paragraph 128).     The policy of investigating manufacturing methods and. preparing process specifications for the guidanceof new contractors is already in force, notably throughthe Directorate of Industrial Planning, formerly knownas the Supply Board Technical Establishment.   One greatessential for rapid expansion of such specialisedequipment is skilled labour, and a nucleus of suchlabour can only be obtained by placing orders withthe trade.    Without orders labour would lose its skill and drift away to other work.     The execution of the present Defence programme has shown the tremendous importance of private industryin helping to meet the requirements of the three Services,and the vital necessity cf preparing it for its task of expansion by placing educational orders and providingit with additional machine tools, jigs, gauges, etc.Big extensions of works are now taking plane in many directions, and it would be very difficult to justifyheavy capital expenditure on new Government factoriesif existing capacity is sufficient to meet requirements as far as can be foreseen.    Private industry would beall the more important in a major emergency whichwould involve the mobilisation of all the industrial resources of the country for the production of war material.     For the above reasons the extension of Governmentmanufacture of all types is considered to be impracticable..The question of extending the range of Governmentmanufacture is one which must be considered on the merits of each case.    Due regard must be paid to economy,                   -11-
 htriction ofBefits in laee-time.adequacy cf existing trade facilities, and thepossibility of maintaining the Government plant andworkers9 unsupported by commercial orders which, inthe case of private traders, often keep the.resources in being when Service requirements are few, and putcommercial technical developments at the disposalof the Services.,     Conclusion 7 is as follows:-        (t\7e recommend that measures be taken to          restrict the profits of armament firms          in peace-time to a reasonable scale          of remuneration, designed not only to          prevent excessive profits, but to          satisfy the public that they do so.          (Chapter IX);!.     This recommendation is in the nature of agenerality, and reference to the text of the Reportdoes not give much help as to what the commission had in mind;   indeed, they say:-        &quot;fe do not propose to undertake the task          of formulating specific methods for the          restriction of profits in peace-time.          No doubt it is one fraught with technical          difficulty,   We have taken no evidence          that would afford us a basis for the          consideration of the problems involved,          and we are not a suitable body to advise          on these problems&apos;1&apos;.  (paragraph 136).     They point out, however, that their proposals would bring the control of prices within the purview of the body suggested in the first part of conclusion, and they seem to envisage that body instituting some system of control which would prevent excessive profitson armaments manufacture as a whole.-IS-
CONCLUSION 8.Conscript action of  Industryin War-time.     As I have already stated, we do not favour theestablishment of that body.   It cannot, howe ver o be    ^* 2i S:too clearly or often stated that the check on the profits of armament firms in peace-time is part of the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government.   As mentioned in the statement relating to Defence (Cmd. 5107, paragraphs 57-59),         &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined that           the needs of the nation shall not serve to           pile up extravagant profits for those who           are called upon to meet them.....  On the           other hand, it is important to retain the           goodwill of industry, for in peace-time firms           cannot be compelled to undertake contracts           on terms which they consider unreasonable....           His Majesty1s Government believe that all           these difficulties can be overcome through           the organisation they have in mind.   Control           to prevent excessive profits will be effectively           exercised by inspection of books, adequate           technical costings, audits on behalf of the           State and arbitration in cases of dispute.           The Government are satisfied that this can           be done without impairing the confidence and           enterprise of contractors undertaking novel           and difficult tasks&quot;.     In pursuance of this policy arrangements have beenmade in each Contracting Department for controlling prices,and co-ordination is effected through the Treasury Inter-Services Committee, the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee,and the well-established practice in the ContractingDepartments of keeping each other informed when any one ofthem places, or is contemplating placing, contracts witha firm with which any other is dealing.     If some new central body, such as is recommended bythe Commission, were established, its powers would in fact be no greater that those of individual Departments, andit is not obvious that the centralisation proposed by theRoyal Commission would effect any improvement in the situatior     Conclusion 8 is as follows:-        &quot;We are of opinion that the problems involved in          formulating plans for the conscription of          industry in war-time will have to be faced, and          should be faced without delay.  (Chapter IX.)&quot;     It is recognised that, as in the last War, a much widermeasure of control over industry will be needed in war thanin peace, and work has been proceeding for some time on themeasures neeessarv,     . ^                       -io-
      Conclusion 9 covers a good deal of ground h and can best be considered in its component parts,-head ( i ): -  w\?e are of opinion that the admini-             stration of the system of licensing             exports of arms should be governed             by an outlook different from.,             and. more positive in character             than, that which now prevails&quot;0      A nation like the United Kingdom, which is  a small military -Power in peace, but may need to become a large one in war, must allow an export trade in armaments (subject to proper supervision) if it is to maintain its productive capacity?    for that productive capacity cannot be equated with idle plant.     This is a funda- mental fact which must govern our,arms export policy so long as armaments are unrestricted and. war a possibility,.     Temporarily it is overshadowed by our re-conditioning programme, but it is  there.      It Is,  therefore,  impossible to accept the argument which the Royal Commission advance in paragraph 148 of their Report,  that the nucleus  of productive capacity due to the export trade is  so small that it is not worth while to encourage  its growth and that its reduction or disappearance are matters of indifference.   The nucleus  is certainly small,  but  this increases rather than diminishes  the risk  that the United Kingdom may in a grave  emergency find itself without any internal resources from which to arm itself.      This  does not mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government are seeking to increase the world trade in  arms,  but that they are interested in
 in British firms  securing a share of such trade as inevitably takes place so long as some nations are unable,  in whole or in part,  to manufacture the war  material  necessary for their own self- defence.     The dangers of this trade to world peace have been much  exaggerated.    The  issue, peace or war,  lies  for the most part with the Great Powers  that can manufacture their  own arm amen ts.     It  follows that,  provided proper supervision is  exercised,  the export  licensing machinery should be  such  as to  minimise  interference  and delays   otherwise British firms will  merely lose legitimate trade to  their foreign competitors.     Yftien  the Royal Commission refer  to  &quot;a  more positive outlook&quot; they mean     &quot;the  abandoning  of the existing  policy under      which licences  are  granted,  in the  absence      of a specific  and compelling reason for      refusing  them,  and  the substitution of a      policy under which  it is made a part  of the      duty of  the official authorised to grant      licences; acting upon grounds specifically      authorised by the controlling body recommen-      ded in Chapter VIIT, to  satisfy himself in      each case that  there is  need for granting      a  licence taking all considerations into      account&quot;  (Paragraph 149 )0     This amounts to  a proposal that  the question to be decidel as regards  any particular apelica- ticn for an export 11 end.ee should  not be whether there is any objection to the proposed, export,but whether it is actually desirable.,    This principle would entail for the Department responsible for advising  the licensing authority, and particularly the Foreign Office, an exceeding- ly difficult and. delicate, appreciation of other people&apos;s business - the other people being foreign Governments.    This, we consider, would, be  an impossible task and one fraught with grave dangers                 -15-
                                                    ;  227      clangers  of  international friction  and misunderstanding.           The  suggestion underlying  the Commission&apos;s      proposal, i. e. , that insufficient  supervision  is  at      present exercised, cannot be  accepted., and the Commission      adduce no evidence to prove it.  As regards control  over      the export  of  arms this country is second to no other  -      a view clearly confirmed by the present situation in      regard to arms for Spain.          So far, therefore, as the  Commission&apos;s recommenda-      tion under  this sub-head stresses  the need for proper      supervision  over the grant of export licences, we concur;     but the implied criticism of the Departments responsible ,      for advising the licensing authority cannot be accepted.Sub-head (ii);-                 &quot;That licences&apos;should be granted only to                  such firms as shall have been specifically                  authorised to accept  orders for export by                  the controlling body already recommended&quot;.          This recommendation doubtless derives from the     Royal Commission&apos;s strictures on the present operation      of the licensing system just dealt with0    It is     difficult to see what useful purpose would be served     by sirperimposing a general authorisation of firms     upon the particular authorisation (by licence) of their     exports.   All manufacturers and. dealers in arms are     already registered under the provisions  of the Firearms     ActsSub-he ad (i ii) : -                 &quot;That  the grant of licences  should                  be restricted to orders by foreign                  Governments,  supported by import                  licences issued by those Govem-                  ments,  which  shall state that the                  goods will not be re-exported&quot;.          It is already the  general practice  of His Majesty&apos;s     Government to issue licences for the export of war     material only to Governments or to the accredited agents cf
  Governments for delivery to them.    But this naturally  does not apply to personal weapons, industrial explosives  and unarmed aircraft, although applications in respect of  small arms and small arms ammunition to which any suspicious  circumstances attach, always receive very close scrutiny,  while the export of aircraft of military type, to  undesirable destinations is prevented by administrative  measures of control.,   Thus the practice actually adopted  by the licensing authorities goes  a very long way.towards  realising the Royal Commission&apos;s intention.         1 if he re, as is generally the  case, a foreign Government  is itself the purchaser of war material, it is difficult  to see what purpose would be served by requiring an import  licence from the Goverurnei! -u         We consider that- the policy hitherto adopted in this  matter should be maintained, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should not require import authorisations or any  special-  certificate unless and. until this is provided for  in an interns.tional agreement accepted by the other supplying  countries.    I would, emphasise the fact that the result  of imposing on British firms any restrictions which are not  imposed, on their foreign competitors is to place them at a  disadvantage and to encourage the  transfer of trade  elsewhere where it may not be under such strict control-,  and will -benefit the productive capacity, not of ourselves,  but of some other country.-Sub-head (iv)i-          &quot;We recommend that the practice of issuing           open general licences for the export of           certain classes of arms,  etc., be           discontinued; that specific  licences be           required in all cases; and in particular           that a rigid control be exercised over           all exports of aircraft,  whether classified           as military or civil&apos;&apos;.  The classes of material at present covered, by Open                      . -17-
General Licences are:-     (a) aircraft, assembled or dismantled,         and aircraft engines:     (b) bayonets, swords and lances:     (c) smooth-bore shotguns and ammunition         for use therewith:     (d) certain explosives used either in the         manufacture of shotgun cartridges or         for industrial purposes:     (e) fire-arms and ammunition covered by a         United Kingdom fire-arms certificate,         when exported by the holder of the         certificate.       In the case of Items (c), (d) and (e) (smooth-boreshotguns,, industrial explosives, etc, ) it is clearlyundesirable that the hampering requirement of specificlicences, should be introduced.   On the other hand,complete decontrol would seem inadvisable.   We havedecided, therefore, to maintain the existing Open GeneralLicences in respect of these items.       Item (b) I &quot;bayonets, swords and lances&quot;, is ofinsignificant  importance from the point of view of export.We see no difficultyin making; them subject to specificlicences.       As regards item (a), &quot;aircraft&quot;, the Government have carefully considered the possibility of meeting the RoyalCommi s si on &apos; s recommendation.       We feel that its application&apos;to civil.aircraft would cause  real  hardship such as we  should not by unilateral action impose  upon  civil flying  in this country.   I would point  out,  however, that in the  event of  any danger arisingthat civil  aircraft may be exported from  this country in anemergency for military purposes,  there is power to revoke the open General Licence in respect of any aircraft of any country  concerned.
I foreign  KNLI8 TMENTI ACT, 1870.GONOIUSION 10.The  Cessation  ofPrivate ExportTrade  in  Surplusand  second-handArms and  Muni-tions  of  War.       As regards military aircraft we have reachedthe conclusion that the export of these could, withoutany serious disadvantage, he subjected to the requirement of specific export licences, suhject to administrative details being worked out in consultation between the Departments concerned, and we havedecided to take action accordingly.       Aircraft engines, however, should, we consider,continue to be subject to Open General Licence.-,       In paragraph 152 of the Report, the RoyalCommission recommend in effect the extension to aircraft of the terms of Section 11 of the ForeignEnlistment Act, 1870, which applies to naval or military expeditions.       We have decided to adopt this recommendation,which will involve an amendment to the Act to bringunarmed aircraft within its terms and to place beyond doubt that armed aircraft are covered also.       Conclusion 10 is as follows:-             &quot;We recommend the complete              cessation of the private              export trade in surplus              and second-hand arms and              munitions of war. (Chapter XI.)&quot;       Apart from such financial advantage as theremay be in these sales, there are some advantages on military and general grounds, in eases where a foreign government cannot afford to purchase newly manufacturedarms in this country, that it should purchase surplusBritish arms rather than go abroad for its supply.There is also some advantage to manufacturers in thiscountry in that orders for ammunition and spare partsmay be attracted.
                                                    .. . 231       It should he noted that it is private  export .  .trade with which this recommendation is concerned.   If itis adopted it will still he permissible to carry out sales of surplus munitions direct to foreign Governments so faras it is practicable!       If the rule is adopted there certainly should becases where it might be necessary to waive it.  lorexample, it might be desirable to allow the sale ofaccessories to a shipbuilding firm which otherwise mightnot be able to obtain them so soon and consequently mightlose the order for the ship.       On a review of all the circumstances we havedecided to adept&apos;, the   recommendation^ of the RoyalCommission, on the understanding that the rule is notabsolute and can be waived in special,  cases.29th January,  19 37.
