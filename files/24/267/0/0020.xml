DOCUMENT.IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1937.SECRET.                                                        c?py Nq.   40CP. 19 (37).CABINET.PROPOSED BILL  TO REMOVE  DOMINICA  FROM  THE  LEEWARD    ISLANDS  FEDERATION AND TO PROVIDE  FOR  ITS  FUTURE    WITHIN THE WINDWARD  ISLANDS  GROUP.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    THE Colony of the Leeward Islands at present consists of five Presidencies,namely, Antigua, St.  Christopher  and Nevis,  Dominica, Montserrat, and theVirgin Islands.   Under the Leeward Islands  Act,  1871, the Colony became a federation.    2.   The Governor of the Leeward Islands has recommended that Dominicashould  be taken out  of  the Federation and included constitutionally in theWindward Islands, a group of three Colonies, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent,lying to the south of the Leeward Islands.    3.   Geographically, Dominica is the most southerly island  in the Leewardsgroup and lies between the  two French Islands of Guadeloupe  and Martinique,was  formerly  French and  acquired  by Britain in  the Napoleonic wars : inphysical, linguistic,  social and economic conditions, it is more closely akin to theWindward Islands  than to the other Presidencies in the Leeward Islands.  Astrong  demand for the change has been expressed by the people of Dominica ever since its inclusion in the Leewards Federation; the proposal has also the supportof responsible  people  throughout the Leeward  Islands  and  it  is  gathered that opinion in the Windward Islands  would not be  opposed to  it; and no serious difficulty is anticipated with regard to finance.  I have been impressed with thearguments in favour of the  change, and I have come to the conclusion that, as amatter  of policy,   Dominica should be  taken  out  of the Leeward  IslandsFederation and included in the Windward Islands group.    4.   The Law Officers have advised that Dominica cannot be taken out of theColony of the Leeward Islands except by an Act of Parliament and, further, thatit would be the better course for the Act to make provision for the future positionand status of the Island after the severance.    5.   In the circumstances, I seek the approval of the Cabinet to the proposal that a  Bill for the purpose  should be prepared for introduction in the course ofthis session., if that  can possibly be arranged.  I do not anticipate that there canbe any controversy or  that it will occupy time.                                              (Initialled)       W. O. G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,           January 20, 1937.[14459]
