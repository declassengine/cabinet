(THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).. SECRET.                                             COPY NO,^/4 CP.  13 (57)..                           CABINET.               PROPOSED  INTERNATIONAL SUGAR CONFERENCE.           Memorandum  by  the Lard President of the Council,            Since  the World Monetary and Economic conference in       1933, His Majesty1s  Government have taken part  in prolonged       discussions  as  to  the possibility of an international       agreement to  regulate the production of sugar,  the price of       which has for many years been depressed by over-production.       An improvement  of  prices such as sh.ou.ld be obtainable by       such an  agreement  would not  directly benefit the United       Kingdom, which  is  mainly interested in sugar as a consumer;       but it would be of great assistance to British  sugar-       exporting Colonies,  which His Majesty&apos;s Government has  had       to help  in recent  years with special tariff preferences;       and it would benefit the Exchequer by reducing  the burden       of the subsidy  to  the United Kingdom beet  sugar industry.       The principle of an  international agreement was commended  by       the Olivier  Commission of inquiry into the West Indian sugar       industry (1930) and  by the Greene Committee of  Inquiry into       the United Kingdom industry  (1935)*            Following on the World Conference of 1933 a conference       was held in  London in March  19 34, attended by the United       Kingdom, the United  States of America and  certain important       exporting countries, to consider the advisability of calling       a general conference.  Owing to various obstacles it was not       then found possible  to proceed.  A new initiative was taken       by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in July 1935 when,  in the
White Paper (CmcL4964\ announcing their proposals for theUnited Kingdom industry, they stated their intention of consulting with the Dominions and Colonies as to thepossibility of reopening international negotiations.  The-interested Dominion and Colonial Governments (including theGovernment of India) were consulted accordingly and it wasagreed that an approach should be made to the principalinterested foreign countries.  The basis of agreementcontemplated was that on the one hand importing countries,like the United Kingdom, and countries having preferentialmarkets,  like other Empire countries,  should refrain from further expansion of production while exporters to the &quot;free world market&quot; (i.e. markets where they enjoy no protectionor preference) would allocate the available market amongstthemselves in certain fixed proportions.  As a contributionto agreement it was contemplated that, just as the UnitedKingdom beet industry is,  under the 1935 proposals, limitedto the production of a quantity 7 per cent,  less than peakproduction, exports from the Commonwealth of Australia andthe Union of South Africa and from the Colonial Empire wouldbe limited to 7 per cent,  below their peak exports.  TheDominion Governments agreed to accept this  as Part of aninternational scheme provided His MajestyTs Government inthe United Kingdom gave a pledge to maintain their existingsugar preferences for a further five years.      At this stage of the discussions (December 1935) I was asked to assume general charge of the negotiations.  Ournext step was to consult the foreign countries represented at the Conference of March 1934,  i.e.  the United States ofAmerica and the countries  formerly participating in the&quot;Chadbourne&quot; sugar scheme  (Java,  Cuba, Germany,  Czechoslovakia,                          -2-
Poland, Belgium, Hungary,  Yugoslavia and Peru),   Of these latter all but Java act jointly through the InternationalSugar Committee and our communications were accordingly.addressed to Dr, Colijn in respect of Java and to theInternational Sugar Committee in respect of the rest.  Asthe result of correspondence and conversations early in 1936,all these &quot;ex-Chadbourne&quot; countries exoressed willingness to participate in a Conference but two difficulties emerged.First, they stipulated that such a Conference must also be attended by representatives of Santo Domingo, the Union of soviet Socialist Republics and Japan.  Secondly,  it appeared that the demands of the International Sugar Committee andJava respectively for a share in the &quot;free world market&quot;were irreconcilable.      The first difficulty was removed, first by securingpromises from the Russian and Dominican G-governments thatthey would attend a Conference and then by the withdrawal by Dr. Colijn of his stipulation regarding Janan (whichcountry in reply to an approach by His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad refused to attend).  Subsequently further correspondencehas elicited that Java, although likely to be very obstinate,may not prove absolutely adamant about its quota.  meanwhile the United States Ambassador in London has intimated thecontinued sympathy of the United States Government with the objects of the Conference and its willingness to attend,while the re-election of President Roosevelt renders it reasonable to hope for a continuation of the present systemof regulation of sugar in the United States,  which isessential for any international scheme.      There are still many difficulties which will have tobe removed before an effective agreement can be concluded,                          -3-
in particular the difficulties of the quotas  to  he  allotted to the various exporting countries.    These are, however,matters which can hardly be satisfactorily settled  except at a full Conference and while it is impossible  to  say thatthere is a good chance of success, there is at least somechance, and having regard to the course of past  discussionsHis Majesty&apos;s Government can hardly now withdraw at a stagewhen a number of the difficulties which originally  appearedhave been removed.          I therefore now feel.that we should proceed withthe arrangements for a Conference.   It is proposed that itshould be held in London and it is desirable that it shouldbe held as soon as practicable,  as the production programmes of the European countries have to be settled in  the spring.The most convenient time would appear to be from about the5th April to the 26th April, provided invitations can begot out within the next week or two.   The countries to beinvited are indicated in the annexure to this memorandum.          A question requiring decision is by whom  theConference should be convened.   That held in March 1934was summoned by the Bureau of the World Monetary andEconomic Conference acting through the secretariat  of theLeague of Nations;  and I am informed that the ForeignOffice are anxious that the same procedure should befollowed now.   On the other hand, the countries represented  on the International Sugar Committee are known to prefer that His Majesty&apos;s Government should summonthe Conference themselves,  partly because they would expect the Conference to be more efficiently managed under Britishauspices and partly because of a suspicion, unfounded but nevertheless strongly felt, that Java would secure  privilegedtreatment at a &quot;League&quot; Conference owing to Dr.  Colijn&apos;s
position as Chairman of. the Economic Commission of the world economic Conference and a member of the Bureau.  Germany at onetime  absolutely refused  to attend a Conference connected directly or  indirectly with the League organisation but she is nowunderstood to be willing to attend if the Conference is heldin  London,  The Foreign Office have been asked to obtainconfirmation on this point, and subject to this I shall be glad to  know whether my colleagues concur in the proposal to actthrough the League organisation.  If we do so, the League wouldprovide the secretariat and translators,  but they would haveto be strengthened, by a British  Secretary and by the Secretaryof  the International Sugar Committee,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be responsible, (as at the Monetary and EconomicConference in 1933) for providing the accommodation  requiredfor the meetings of  -the Conference and also for the extra expenditure incurred by  the League owing to the Conferencebeing h eld in London instead of in Geneva,     If t h e above proposal is approved I propose to write to Dr. Colijn in the terms of the draft annexed herewith.Once we know th at  the Conference will be convened, thePrime Minister  will- no doubt  settle, in consultation withthe Ministers  principally interested,  the composition of theUnited Kingdom delegation;   and we shall have to consider indue course the precise lines of United Kingdom policy at theConference.   The  President of  the  Board of Trade has arranged&apos;for a Committee of officials representing   the interested departments to be constituted under  the Chairmanship of theChief  Economic Adviser,  to prepare recommendations.CONCLUSION;        Accordingly I  recommend -     (l)  that  an International  Sugar Conference  should be convened in London on or about  the 5th April next,  and that
His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in t h e United Kingdom should participate in it and &quot;provide accOmmodation etc. as for theWorld Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933;     (2) that (provided the German Government agree to this procedure) the Conference should be convened under the auspices of the Bureau of the World Monetary and Economic Conference,acting through the League of Nations Secretariat?     (3) that  I should be authorised to  write to Dr. Colijn,as the Chairman of the Economic Commission of the Conference,in terms of the attached draft,,                             (intd, ) J.R.M.Privy Council Office.      16th January ,  1937,
Draft letter to Dr.  Colijn.     I  am very grateful for your prompt reply of the29th December to my letter of the 22nd December aboutsugar.   -My colleagues and I have given careful considerationto your  letter and, while we do not disguise from ourselvesthe difficulties in the way of any international agreement,we feel  that in the light of your letters it is desirableto proceed with the arranging of an international conference.     Our proposal is that the Conference should be summoned in London for the 5th of April, on the understandingthat it would not last more than about three weeks at most.The countries to be invited, in addition to the netherlands and the United Kingdom, would be the United States ofAmericac, Germany, France, Italy9 the Union of soviet socialist Republics, Czechoslovakia^ Poland, Belgium,,Hungarys Yugoslavia9 C&apos;uba9 Peru, Santo Domingo9 Japan and china, together with Canada, Australia9 the Union of SouthAfrica and India.   We think that Japan should be formallyinvited even if she is unlikely to accept and we feel that france and Italy cannot be left out of an internationalnegotiation of this importance.     We propose also that, as originally contemplated, theConference should be summoned in the name of the bureau of the World Monetary and Economic Conference9 through theLeague of Nations Secretariat, and we are informed that theGerman Government would no longer raise objection to that procedure.   The British Government would, as in 1933 and19349 assume responsibility for providing accommodation forthe meetings of the Conference.
     As previously agreed^ the representatives ofthe countries participating should, be purely officialsalthough representatives of the industries would no doubtattend as advisers.     If you. agree with these proposals will you3 as chairman of the Economic Commission of the Monetary andEconomic Conferences, instruct the secretariat to issue thenecessary invitations?   You wills of course9 appreciate the need for urgency if adequate notice is to be given;and I would suggest that the secretariat should send the invitations by telegram to the extra-European countries.We have already given them semi-official warning.
