THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                  Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1937.                      231SECRET                                                          Copy  No.   43CP. 45 (37).CABINET.JAPAN.                          THE KEELUNG INCIDENT.          Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    THE Cabinet will recall that at their meeting on the 28th October I drew attention to the maltreatment of three naval ratings  and the insult to a british officer by the Japanese Police on the occasion of a naval visit to Formosa at thebeginning of October. Since then repeated representations have been made to theJapanese  Government,  but so far no  redress has  been  promised.   On  the23rd November I  gave the House of Commons a brief outline of the case and, in answer to a Supplementary Question by Sir Charles Cayzer, I said that satisfac-tion from the Japanese Government would have to be a preliminary to furthervisits of courtesy by His Majesty&apos;s warships to Japanese ports or to similar visitsfrom Japanese warships to British ports.  The question now arises of the bearingof this  on the issue  of  an invitation for a Japanese warship  to  attend  the coronation Naval Review.    2.   With the approval of His Majesty The King, Sir R. Clive was recentlyasked whether he thought the Japanese Government  could be induced to give ussatisfaction if he told them informally  and unofficially that he personally was afraid his Government might hold up, or even possibly refrain  from issuing,  an invitation to send a Japanese warship to the Coronation Naval Review, unless theKeelung affair were settled quickly. Sir R. Clive replied that, in  his opinion, tosay anything of this sort to the Japanese might have the most serious results, suchas cancellation of Prince Chichibu&apos;s acceptance of the King&apos;s invitation to repre-sent the Emperor at the Coronation, and he therefore strongly deprecated taking such a step.    3.   At  the  suggestion of the  Japanese  Minister for Foreign Affairs,  theNaval Attache and the Japanese Counsellor of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Tokyoare proceeding to Keelung, where they are due on the  2nd February.  They are todiscuss the question with the Governor-General and the Procurator of the island in the light of the very full report drawn up by the British Court of Enquiry, setup by the Commander-in-Chief in China.   It is just possible that the Japanesemay be intending to climb down and that they have suggested this visit by membersof our Embassy to Formosa with this end in view.  It would  be unwise,  however,to assume that this is so,  and in  any case, the  result of  these talks may not  be known for some little time.    4.   The Admiralty are anxious to issue the invitations to the Naval Reviewas soon  as possible, and it may be impossible to defer the decision,  whether  ornot to invite the Japanese, pending the result of the  Naval Attaches talks withthe Governor-General.  It may be argued that  if we cannot, receive  a Japaneseship on  a visit of courtesy, still less can we receive one at the Review.   Never-theless,T feel that the case of the Naval Review is sui generis and, notwithstandingwhat I  said to Sir Charles Cayzer on the 23rd November,  I consider  that  an      [14544].                                              &apos;:&apos;
invitation should be sent to the Japanese at the same time as the other maritimePowers are invited.  I fear that,  if  they  are not invited  when  all the othermaritime Powers are, there might be ill  effects disproportionate to  the matter a tissue.  I am sure that the  Cabinet would not wish to run the rislc of this, and Ishould therefore be grateful if I might  have the authority  of my colleagues to treat the Japanese on the same footing as the other maritime  Powers and to issue to them an invitation to  the Naval Review even  though the  Keelung incidentremains unsettled.     I would, however, suggest that, if it be possible, the issue of all&apos; invitationsmight be suspended for ten days or a fortnight.  If we issue an invitation tothe Japanese now, I fear that our  chances of getting a satisfactory solution ofthe Keelung incident would be considerably reduced, &quot;and I would therefore prefer to see whether the discussion in Formosa results in a settlement.    If this were agreed, I would explain the situation to  Sir R.  Clive and instruct him to do his best to hasten a settlement, though I fear that in the circumstances  prevailing in.Japan.at the moment, the prospects are not very encouraging.                                                                    A. E.Foreign Office,    February 1, 1937.
