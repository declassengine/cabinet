SPAIN:  THE  BALEARIC  ISLANDS.(Previous Papers Nos. C.O.S. 509 and 536.)                                  Report.                                 ?     THE Cabinet, at a meeting* held on the 16th December, 1936, agreed- ,. :,         &quot; That the  Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should be asked to consider,  -   from a strategical point of view, the consequences of either          (i) an Italian occupation of Majorca,  or         (ii) an arrangement between the Italian Government and the  Spanish               Government or with the Government of a Republic of Majorca,               under which, in time of emergency, the Italians could make use               of the facilities of  this Island in particular, or of the Balearic               Islands generally.&quot;     2.  In August  1936  we were  instructed  to  consider the extent to which british interests would be affected in the event of Italy taking some action whichmight upset the existing  balance in  the Western  Mediterranean.  Our Report(C.O.S. Paper No. 509) included the following  passage :          &apos;&apos; An Italian occupation of any of the Balearic Islands would probably     not be acceptable to the islanders  themselves,  but  the possibilities of their     having to submit to force majeure  cannot be ruled out.         The naval facilities  in these islands are at present as  follows :          Majorca, 450 miles from Gibraltar, has no harbour entirely suitable for     a naval base,  since Palma and Pollenza Bay, although good  in some ways,     are too exposed.  Minorca, which  is still further -from  Gibraltar, has  in     Port Mahon a small, but heavily defended,  naval base.         As regards  air facilities, there  are, so far as is known, no military air     stations in the Balearic  Islands at the present time; but there is no doubt     that they could be established without  great difficulty.   It  is understood     that there  is a satisfactory aerodrome site at  Pollenza,  and  that civil sea-     plane services were operated at Port Mahon and Palma.         In view of  the foregoing, an Italian  occupation  of any of the Balearic     Islands would not vitally affect British strategical interests.   At the same&apos;     time, it would give Italy  a base for naval and air operations,  250 miles     nearer Gibraltar than anything  which she  possesses at  the  present  time.     The  menace to our control of the  Straits, and to Gibraltar itself, would  thus     be increased.&quot;     3.  From the strategical point of view, the only new development which hasoccurred  since the above Report was written is that military air stations are known to have  been  established in  the  Balearic Islands.   This, however, in no                          * Cab. 75 (36), Conclusion 4.       [14421]SECRET.COS.  544.
way invalidates the conclusion  quoted in the preceding  paragraph, since weexpressly took into account the fact that air stations could be established  without difficulty.     4.  ^Turning now to Question (ii), namely, the strategic consequences of^anarrangement between the Italian  Government and the Spanish Government, uhdefwhich,  in time  of  emergency, the Italians could make use of the facilities ofMajorca in particular, or of the Balearic Islands generally, the conclusion quoted in Paragraph 2 applies Avith even greater force.  The only difference between thetwo cases is  that the actual occupation of the Islands in time of peace wouldenable the Italians  to make all  necessary antecedent preparations, and  thus to operate at maximum intensity as soon as hostilities commenced.  If they were merely to be permitted to make use of the Islands after the outbreak of war, therewould be an  appreciable  time-lag before their air  forces  could develop their maximum effort.     5.  &quot;We consider that an  effective Italian control  of  the  Balearic  islands would result in  a certain increase in Italian prestige in the Mediterranean andneighbouring  countries,  and in  a corresponding diminution in the prestige ofthis country.  This, however, would not have really serious consequences, unless we  had tried, and failed, to  thwart the Italian project.     6.  To sum up, we re-affirm  our previously recorded conclusion that neitheran  Italian occupation  of Majorca nor  an arrangement  between the  ItalianGovernment and the Spanish Government, under which, in time of emergency,the Italians could make use of the facilities of this island in particular, or of theBalearic Islands generally, would vitally affect British strategical interests.
