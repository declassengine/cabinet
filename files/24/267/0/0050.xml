February 1937.SECRET.CP. i9 (37).CABINET.REPORT  OF  COMMITTEE SET  UP TO  CONSIDER  DEVELOPMENT         OF  CIVIL  AVIATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.               Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.     I HAVE discussed with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer the proposals ofthe Maybury Committee, whose Report was circulated as C.P. 25  (37);  and we agree that the recommendations in the Report which involve Government actionought to be adopted.     2.   The two most important recommendations relate to the licensing of airlines and the provision of radio facilities and  a comprehensive air traffic control by the Government.  While the proposals  are separate,  they are closely linkedin argument and on merits.  The Committee show convincingly that internal air transport  in  the United Kingdom  is unlikely to become a paying propositionunless two conditions are fulfilled :      (i) A meteorological  service, radio facilities and control to make possible           flying in all weather.     (ii) Regulation of air traffic so as to  eliminate wasteful competition and           ensure economic working costs and  an adequate payload  for machines           in service.     3.   The Committee accordingly recommend         &quot;That., all radio facilities  and  a comprehensive  air  traffic  control     organisation adequate to ensure the safety and regularity  of air communica-     tions at all times in the United Kingdom should be provided, maintained and     operated by  the Government.   This should be combined  with  the meteoro-     logical organisation immediately concerned with internal flying.        &quot; The  capital cost of carrying out  these recommendations is anticipated     to be  about  320,000,  and the  total annual cost about  240,000,  of which     about  40,000 per annum is already being incurred or in prospect. The whole     cost of the Meteorological Service is already borne by the Government.        &quot; In putting forward these recommendations we recognise that the State     would thus be making a substantial additional contribution to the develop-     ment of aviation in this country.  We  have deliberately selected this  rather     than the method of subsidy as a means of assisting in the initial stages, since     we trust that in the course of time it will prove possible for the burden to be     transferred to aviation itself through the medium of registration fees or some     similar device &quot; (paragraphs 142 and 143).     4.   At the same time  the  committee proposed propose that all regular air services should be licensed, particular consideration being given to the licensing of  certainair routes, the operation of which ^f or a fixed  term of years under special conditions would provide valuable information  as to the possibilities of commercial aviation in this  country under the most favourable circumstances.

    5.  The specially selected routes which the Committee recommend are the -lines  joining  Belfast, Glasgow-Edinburgh, Newcastle, London,  Southampton-Portsmouth and Bristol.  The total route mileage of direct connections between these  termini would be 2,900 miles,  which  would  mean  considerable cost ofdevelopment in view of the traffic likely to be obtainable within a reasonable time;At a small sacrifice of speed, it is possible to give an equivalent service by joining the selected termini to a central  junetion aerodrome instead  of directly to eachother,  thus reducing the route mileage  from 2,900  to 960 miles.   The centraljunction might well be situated in the Manchester-Liverpool area.  This arrange-ment  constitutes the  Junction Aerodrome System  on  which  the  Committee&apos;srecommendations for special consideration  are based  (paragraphs 127,  128  andMaps A and B, Appendices 9 and 10).    6.  They recommend that a licence for  regular  passenger services on thejunction routes should be granted  to a  single company or to a combination of companies working on the closest terms of co-ordination.  This licence should belimited in the first instance to a term  of  five years;,  renewable  thereafter forsuitable periods, if  satisfactory performance has been given  (paragraph 133).    7.  They propose that the licensing authority should take into account theposition of all operating companies in active existence who are now conducting,or have for a substantial period within the last three years  conducted, regular and satisfactory services over any section or sections of the route concerned.  Theyexpress the hope, however, that the companies eligible will combine in  a  singleworking unit to operate the scheme, thereby securing the  maximum economies(paragraph 134).    8.  On other internal routes they recommend that regular passenger services should be licensed in order to ensure the most-effective service to  the public and avoid uneconomical overlapping; but that  such licences should not necessarily be exclusive (paragraph 135).    9.  There is power under the Air Navigation Act to  set up  a licensing authority  and a licensing  system by Order in  Council which would require a positive resolution  of both Houses  of Parliament.    10.  On merits, I think there is no doubt that the proposals of the Committeeoffer the best,  and indeed the only, prospect of making internal air services self-supporting.  The licensing proposals, which I thought might have  evoked some criticism,  have, in fact, met with considerable support in the press.    11.  I  therefore  recommend  that the  Government  should  adopt  bothproposals.   The meteorological service, radio equipment and  facilities would beprovided by the Air Ministry, and the Air Ministry would assume whatever degreeof control over actual flying is necessary, covering both civil  and Service flying.    12.  The Post  Office, who were represented on  the Committee,  have agreedto co-operate  where  mail  contracts  can  usefully  and  properly   be  placed(paragraphs 150-155).    13.  There will, no doubt, be  some local lobbying to  get the  lines of thejunction route altered, but I  think we must stand firm on the Report.  The  AirMinistry must, I think, accept the  invidious task of deciding what  aerodromesare to  be selected to serve  Manchester-Liverpool and  Glasgow-Edinburgh.Unfortunately,  careful investigation  on  the spot  has shown  that  the onlyaerodrome site which is at all adequate for the latter is a site close to Glasgow.    14.  The Committee recommend that financial assistance for a limited period should be  given to a suitable  flying  school, so that it can offer advanced training for air line pilots at low rates, preference being given to short service pilots whohave  retired from  the R.A.F., and that consideration should be given to thequestion of continuing similar arrangements on  a  permanent basis  for  short-service pilots of the R.A.F.  I am advised that the cost of this should not exceed 10,000 a year (I hope it will be rather less).  It is a very desirable recommenda-tion, as there is a  real shortage  of highly-trained pilots for  this kind of civilflying.  The proposal will be a real help both to the  operating companies and topilots,&apos; and the Chancellor and I agree that we ought to accept it.  (Recommen-dation (o).)
    15.  I ought perhaps to mention the blessing which the  Committee give toflying clubs, and the  recommendation that due  weight should be given to their value in reviewing future subsidy arrangements.  (Recommendation&apos; (a).)   We doalready subsidise these clubs on a modest scale, and I hope to hold the. fort onthe basis at present agreed with the Treasury.    16.  The  other  recommendations  mostly  concern  local authorities   andaerodrome proprietors, but in certain cases, such as the proposal for the establish-in en t of a standard scale of aerodrome charges (paragraphs 101-147), may involveaction by the Air Ministry.  In the case of this particular recommendation I should propose to keep a free hand for the time being.                                                                     -   S.:    A ir Ministry, February 5, 1937.
