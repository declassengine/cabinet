LOCAL GOVERNMENT  APT, 1929:   DISTRIBUTION OF EXCHEQUER GRANTS ;                       DRAFT REPORT  ON INVESTIGATION.                  .                   Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.            1.   I  circulate for  the  information of  the Cabinet a draft       of  the Report  on the  results of the  Investigation, which,  by       Section 110  of the Local Government  Act, 1929, I am required to       make, in consultation with representatives of local authorities,       into the method of distribution of the block  grant before       31st March,  1937.  The Report  explains the proposed changes &apos;       in  the method  of calculation of the  grants and I seek the       approval of  my colleagues  for  these  proposals.            2,   It will  be  seen  that the investigation, which has been       exhaustive,  has been  carried out in  close collaboration between       the Ministry and the  representatives of the local authorities       and that practical unanimity has been attained on the main       questions.   From the  outset stress has been laid on the       desirability of so altering the main formula  (based on       &quot;Weighted populations&quot;) for the distribution  between  the       counties and county boroughs as to afford substantial       additional relief  to  the poorer areas within  the limits of       the financial  provisions of the Act. I am pleased to say  that       the local authorities&apos; representatives have responded in a       remarkable degree  to  the appeals made to them and they have       agreed to a  revised formula which will have the effect of       diverting a  large  proportion of the  increased grants  which would       under the&apos; present  formula  have gone  to the more prosperous areas       to  those suffering from depressed conditions  arising  mainly from       prolonged unemployment.  Paragraph 16 of the  Report shows  how
substantial are some of the gains of the poorest areas ascompared with the present position.  The additional assistanceto Merthyr Tydfil will it is estimated amount to the equivalent of a 5/- ratej to Monmouth 3/2d., Glamorgan 2/- and comparableamounts to the Forth Eastern areas.     3.   As regards the other main &quot;branch of the investigation,namely, the method of the distribution inside the Countiesoutside London it will be seen (paragraph 18 of the Report) thatafter a thorough examination it has not been found possible to propose a method of distribution which on the whole could beregarded as more satisfactory than the existing one.          In the case of London the proposed change in themethod of distribution will benefit the more highly ratedMetropolitan Boroughs like Poplar and Bermondsey at the expenseof the City and the more wealthy boroughs (paragraph 19 of theReport).     4. &quot;;  In accordance with the provisions of Section 86 of theAct the amount of the General Exchequer Contribution for thethird fixed grant period commencing on the 1st April next hasto be determined by parliament  the amount must not, however,be less than the amount required to maintain a minimumproportion of the total rate and grant-borne expenditure.Owing to the growth of this expenditure an additional amount ofabout  4,425,000 of Exchequer money would be required for england and Wales by the operation of the minimum proportion,I considered that this large increase, coupled with the revisionof the formula, presented an opportunity for dealing with thecontributions payable by the local authorities to theUnemployment Assistance Board under the provisions of theUnemployment Act, 1934.  Under the Act as it stands the amountof these contributions as from the 1st April next now falls tobe determined by Parliament, but with the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer I took occasion to announce that
 the question of merging them in the Block Grant was under consider- ation.   The local authorities1 representatives have accepted this proposal, and the Block Grant&apos; Investigation has proceeded on the assumption that the amount of &quot;new money&quot; due on the minimum proportion would he reduced by the present total of these contributions ( 2,187,000 for England and Wales) and that the requirement for payment of these contributions would be repealed, thus removing what has been a source of  some irritation and political agitation.   5.     To give effect to this proposal the provisions of theAct of 1929 laying down the minimum proportion, which the block grant must bear to the total expenditure of local authorities will require amendment.   In this amendment it will also be necessary to provide for the adjustment required in consequence of the transfer of responsibility for certain trunk roads from the local authorities to the Ministry of Transport, and also for an increase in the grant by way of compensation to local authorities for theproposed ^abolition of the Male Servants Licence Duties.   This is explained in paragraph 20 of the Report.   6.     Following the adoption of the revised formula somemodifications are proposed in the provisions governing theguarantee grants, i.e. the grants given under the proviso to.. Section 89 of the Act and the &quot;Additional&quot; and &quot;Supplementary&quot;Exchequer grants.   As regards the grants under Section 89 an amendment of the provisions of the Section is proposed, afterconsultation with the local authorities concerned, which willeffect a considerable reduction in the liability of the Exchequer.On the other hand it is proposed to modify the provisions relatingto the Additional Exchequer Grants and the Supplementary exchequer grants with a view to ameliorating the position of authorities whosuffer a loss in consequence of the changes effected by theprovisions of the Act or the changes now proposed.   Thesemodifications will involve an increase in the liability of theExchequer, or a retarding of the relief which would otherwise haveaccrued to the Exchequer;   the details are under discussion.
   7.    In view of the economic fluctuations of the last few yearsand of the alterations now proposed in the formula for distributionof the Block Grant the. local authorities are pressing for afurther review before the time when the grant will be distributedwholly on the formula.   It is proposed to agree to this request(paragraph 25 of the Report).          The&quot; following is a summary of the proposals for whichlegislative provision would be necessary;- ,    (i) The amount of new Exchequer money for the third fixed    grant period to be determined on the basis of the amount    ( 4,425,000) calculated on the minimum proportion of rate and    grant-borne expenditure in 1935/6 in accordance with Section 06    of the Act of 1929, less (a) the amount of the present    contributions payable by local authorities to the Unemployment    Assistance Board  ( 2,187,000) and (b) a sum of  135,000 in    respect of the transfer of trunk roads, and increased by (c) a    sum of  115,000 in respect of the abolition of male servants&apos;    licence duties;  corresponding amendment will also be    required in respect of the minimum proportion for the fourth    and subsequent fixed grant periods.    (ii) The substitution of the revised formula for calculating    weighted population for the existing formula.    (iii) Consequential amendments of the provisions relating to    the calculation of the additional Exchequer grants referred    to in paragraph 6.    (iv) Provision for a further statutory investigation.   8.     I shall be glad to receive authority to proceed with thepreparation of a Bill embodying these proposals in which theChancellor of the - Exchequer agrees generally.

            LOCAL  GOVERNMENT ACT, 1929  REPORT  ON  RESULT  OF  INVESTIGATION                UNDER  SECTION  110                &apos; (ENGLAND AND WALES)                         PART  I.            NATURE AND SCOPE  OF INVESTIGATION.Authority for investigation.  i. The Minister of Health is required by Section no of theLocal Government Act, 1929, to  cause  an investigation  to bemade  before   the  31st March,  1937,   into  the  system of distributing the amount of  the  Exchequer contribution underthe Act towards local revenues, generally known as the block grant, and to cause a report on the result of the investigation to be laid before Parliament.   The investigation to be  madefalls into two main parts, viz. (i)  the method of apportionmentof the grant (the &quot; General  Exchequer Contribution &quot;) to each county and county borough, in so far as it is distributed on thebasis of the formula of weighted population, and (ii) the methodof allocation within each county of the amount apportioned to it.The text of Section no  of the Act is given in Appendix I and ageneral outline  of the Block Grant provisions in Appendix II.Local Authorities consulted.  2. The Act  provides that the  Minister  shall consult with&apos;&apos; such Associations of  Local Authorities as - appear to him tobe concerned and with  any local authority with  whom consul-tation appears  to him  to be desirable.&quot;  Accordingly, at theend  of November,  1935, the Minister  conferred with repre-sentatives of the following:        the County Councils  Association;      the Association of Municipal Corporations;      the Urban District Councils Association;      the Rural District Councils Association;and  as regards London      the London County Council;      the Metropolitan  Boroughs Standing Joint Committee.Procedure.  3. At this conference the Minister  asked the representativesof the local authorities  to consider with him the procedure bywhich the investigation  could best be conducted and drew their attention to the original intention that assistance afforded to localauthorities by means of the  block grant should  vary  with theneed for local  government services in any area in  relation to
the ability of the area to meet the cost.  The Minister drew attention in particular  to  the  desirability of affording greaterassistance towards the special needs of necessitous areas withinthe limits of the financial provisions of the Act.  He suggestedthat the  local authorities&apos;  representatives might consider, inter alia, such questions as the following:        (i) How far has the distribution in the first and second   grant periods accorded  with the original intention of the   Act?      (ii) Does  the experience so far gained suggest that the   needs of the poorer areas  and, in particular, the distressed   areas are met under the present method of distribution to   the extent of the original intention ?      (iii) Does the variation between  period and period in   amount of grant consequent on a rise or fall in population,   etc., fairly reflect,  as intended,  the variation in the needs   of the area, or is some modification desirable ?      (iv) Will the alterations to be made, under the present   law, in the method of distribution in the third grant period   still further assist in carrying out the original objects of the   scheme ?      (v)  Is  the method of  division of the  grant inside the   county fair, on the whole, to the various classes of authority,   having regard to their respective responsibilities?Appointment of financial advisers. 4. The Associations nominated financial advisers to investigateon  their  behalf the operation of the block grant scheme in itsseveral parts and to confer with the Ministry as might be founduseful.  The local authorities were promised the fullest assistanceof the Ministry in the investigation of the working of the schemeand of the various  proposals which had already been made or might be made for variations.Course of investigation. 5. During the  ensuing year the Ministry were  continuouslyengaged  in the investigation and  in accordance with the initialarrangements furnished the representatives of the local authori-ties with all  relevant statistical and other  information.   Thefinancial advisers, including  nominees of the Institute of Muni-cipal Treasurers and the County Accountants Society, worked asa joint conference for the examination  of the main questions.Financial officers  representing  necessitous  areas  were  alsospecially co-opted to the conference.  When  the conference had reached its conclusions the respective groups of advisers made their reports to their Associations and these  reports formed thebasis of the observations and suggestions which were submittedto the Minister  by - the Associations and the  London  CountyCouncil.40697A 2
 Amount of the block grant.   6. The provisions for determining the  amount of the  block grant and for distributing it to local authorities, including the provisions relating to certain guarantee grants, are contained in Part VI of the Local Government Act, 1929, and were explained in Cmd.  Paper 3134 issued in  1928 (extracts therefrom  are reproduced in Appendix II).   The  amount of the General  Exchequer Contribution for the first fixed grant period under the Act of 1929 was slightly over  43^ millions a year.  For the second fixed grant period it was nearly  44 millions, equivalent to approximately 23  per cent, of the *&quot; rate and grant borne expenditure &quot; in the year 1931-32, the  penultimate  year  of the preceding grant period. That percentage represents the  proportion which the amount of the  grant for the first fixed grant period bore to the total amount of rate  arid grant borne expenditure in  the first year of that fixed grant period.  Under the provisions of Section 86 of the Act of 1929 tiris minimum proportion of Exchequer money must be maintained on each  revision of the block grant.  In the  third fixed grant period commencing  on the 1st April, 1937, the  mini- mum addition of new Exchequer money under these provisions would  be about  4,427,000  and the  amount of the &quot;General Exchequer Contribution about   48,349,000.   The&apos;additional amount to be provided has to be considered in connection with other matters, viz. :&quot;-     -  (a)  the proposed merging in the block grant of the total     of  the contributions  payable by local  authorities under     Section 45 of the Unemployment Act, 1934;       (&amp;)  the proposed deduction from the block grant in con-     sequence   of  the transfer  of trunk  roads  from  county     councils to the Ministry of Transport;       (c)  the  proposed addition to the  block  grant by way     of  compensation for  the cessation of  the male  servants     licence duties.   In regard to (a) the Minister, in the Debate on 21st July,  1936, on the  subject of  the Unemployment Assistance Regulations explained that it was under consideration to merge these contri- butions in the block grant as from 1st April, 1937, by a reduction in the General Exchequer Contribution.  The discussions with the representatives of the  local  authorities regarding  the block grant revision  proceeded on the assumption  that from the  in- crease in the General  Exchequer Contribution for the third  fixed grant period, there will be deducted the total of these unemploy- ment contributions amounting to  2,187,000.  * &quot;Rate and  grant borne expenditure&quot; means the expenditure of localauthorities met from rates  and  grants out of  the  General  exchequer contribution.
         * Appendix II;  paragraph 22 of Cmd. 3134.40697                                               A 3  In regard to (6) it was stated in paragraph 10 of the Financialand Explanatory Memorandum on the Trunk Roads.Bill that.itivas not proposed to require any specific contributions from localauthorities to future works  on the transferred trunk roads, butthat regard would  be had to the transfer in the  negotiations with were proceeding as to  the General Exchequer Contribu-tion for the next fixed grant period.  The  discussions with therepresentatives of the local authorities were on the basis, that from the  beginning of the  third fixed grant period (ist April,1937)&apos; when this transfer will take effect a reduction would bemade on  this account in the General Exchequer  Contributionequivalent to  the normal proportion of grant attracted by theexpenditure, i.e. about.  133,000 representing approximately23 per  cent,  of  the   transferred expenditure  estimated  at 575.000.  In regard to (c) the Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply to aquestion in Parliament on  30th November, 1936, said that thepossibility of  abolishing the local taxation duty derived fromthe proceeds of licences for  male servants had been noted as oneof the subjects for  examination in connection with  the revisionof the block grant.   It is proposed to provide for the abolition ofthis duty  at the  first opportunity and to provide for an additionto the total of  the block grant of a sum  of   115,000 corre-sponding to the  net loss to  local revenues.  After allowing for the foregoing adjustments the amount ofthe General Exchequer  Contribution  for the third fixed grantperiod would be about  46,144,000.Distribution of the  Block Grant.    -  .  7. The Act provides  for apportioning  to each  county and county  borough  in the first and second fixed grant periods anamount   equal   to  75  per  cent, of  its  estimated  losses*on account of rates  and discontinued grants  in the  standardyear (1928-29), 50 per cent, in the third and 25 per cent, in thefourth,  the balance  of the  General  Exchequer  Contributionbeing distributed on the formula of  weighted population;  inthe fifth and succeeding grant periods the distribution will be wholly  on formula.  The amount distributed in  proportion  toweighted  population, which is  14,993,000 in the second fixedgrant period,  would, after  taking into account the  adjustmentsreferred to in the preceding paragraph, be about  26,636,000 inthe third fixed grant period.  The distribution  within each county is  on the basis of  allo-cating to the urban and rural district councils, out of the amountapportioned.to the county, grants calculated mainly on a capita-tion basis,  the county  council receiving the balance; thus,  ineffect, the districts share in  the balance in proportion to rateable value.   The distribution in  London is on a  special basis.
 Changes in general conditions since  1929.  &apos;   8. In making the investigation it had to be borne in mind that during the period following the introduction of the Act of 1929 considerable changes had taken place.  There had been a grave increase and  later  a  progressive decrease in the  volume of unemployment.  There has  been a  considerable  shifting of population, a  decline  in. the birth  rate, two  quinquennial revaluations, a revival of  industry in many  areas but  a con- tinuance of industrial  depression in some  others.  During this period also the  responsibility for the assistance of the able-bodied unemployed has been assumed by the Government, and agricul- tural workers have been brought within the scheme of unemploy- ment insurance; as from 1st  April, 1937,  the Ministry of Transport  will take over from the county councils  the trunk- roads.                        PART  II. APPORTIONMENT TO COUNTIES AND COUNTY BOROUGHS ON THE             BASIS OF  WEIGHTED POPULATION. Formula.   9. The Rules  for calculating  the  weighted populations of counties and county boroughs are  contained in  Part  III of the Fourth  Schedule to  the Local Government Act,  1929  (see paragraphs  22 and 23  of Cmd.  3134  in  Appendix II)  and provide that for each fixed  grant period the weighted population shall be calculated by &apos;&apos;  weighting &apos;&apos; the  population of the area in the last year of the previous  grant period by reference to certain  factors, namely, the  number of children under five, rateable  value  per  head of population,  unemployment among insured persons and, in counties, the population per  mile of roads.  As  explained in Cmd. 3134 the  intention was that the apportionment  should be based on general characteristics inde- pendent  of  actual expenditure, and the factors selected were designed so to adjust the distribution  as to&apos; make the  assistance vary with the need for local government services in any area in relation to the ability  of the area to meet the cost. Examination into the working of the formula.  10. In order to examine the working  of  the rules  contained in the Fourth Schedule of the Act and  to consider what changes, if  any, were advisable in the  formula for weighted  populationit was necessary to have regard to the weighted populations and the distribution of grants in the first and second  grant periods and the probable position in the third grant period if the formula remained unchanged.   Particulars  relating to the  first  and second fixed grant  periods were  published in the Ministry ofHealtiVs Annual Report for 1933-34, Appendices XVI-XX,  and
these, together with the forecasts for the third fixed grant period and the statistical information referred to in paragraph 5,  weremade available to the representatives of local authorities in the investigation.  Full consideration was given to  the matters to which theMinister had  drawn particular attention at the opening of the investigation   (see  paragraph 3).  An  examination  of  the statistics  which enter into the calculation of the formula ofweighted  populations showed  that, since the commencement ofthe Act, the increase of population, accompanied by the generalfall in the number of children under five and the general increasein rateable values, was tending to increase the proportion of theformula  grant attracted by the basic factor of population andcorrespondingly to decrease the effect  of the weighting factors.This tendency, if no alterations were made, would  be to theadvantage of  the richer areas (which receive relatively  littleweighting) and to the disadvantage of the poorer areas (whichreceive a relatively high weighting).   The general conclusionsof the local authorities&apos; representatives were to the effect that thedistribution of grants in the first and second fixed grant periodshad substantially accorded with the original  purpose but thatsome modification  was  necessary to  check tendencies to the disadvantage of needy areas as the distribution by formula takes the  place, by stages, of reimbursement of losses of rates  and grants and to relate grants closely to the needs of those areas.Examination of factors  of formula.  11. Consideration was accordingly given to the introductionof additional factors, such as the number of old age pensioners,the number of children of school age, and the number of personsin receipt of out-relief and to various suggestions for altering the method of assessing the relative needs of counties and county boroughs which have been made from time to time and duringthe  course of the  investigation.  These were examined and theresults compared but the conference reached the conclusion thatit was not practicable to secure  a satisfactory improvement bythese means.   They recommend that the existing formula should remain unchanged  in its basis, viz.  population, but it  was feltthat some strengthening of the factors of the formula  was desir-able.Proposed revised formula.  12. Further estimates were prepared by the Ministry with thisobject.  No advantage  was found to  result  from alteration tothe  children  factor&apos; and  there was considerable  diversity ofopinion as to whether any additional weight should be given tothe  rateable  value  factor.   After a  series  of tests a revisedformula,  which is shown in Appendix III in comparison with   40697                                                A 4
the existing formula, ,was recommended unanimously by mem-bers.of the conference to their respective  principals.  The con-clusions are stated to&quot; have been reached in a spirit of corn-promise and in the opinion of the conference are such as would produce a settlement, of county and county borough apportion-ments  which  can  reasonably  be  accepted.&quot;   The  revisedformula was. accepted by the London County Council and the associations of Local Authorities, subject to reservations in theevent of acceptance not being general; Increased weighting forunemployment and sparsity-.-  ,13.  It will be observed on comparing, the two formulae that the  revised formula,-differs  from the existing  formula in the weighting attaching, to  the unemployment and sparsity factors. Under the provisions of the, Act of 1929 the weighting for un- e,m.ployment. is calculated by reference to the percentage of the population in excess of  i-J per cent., which the number of unem- ployed insured men plus 10  per cent, of the number  of unem- ployed insured women bears to the whole  population.   It is provided that in the first and second fixed grant periods this excess percentage shall be multiplied by 10 and that in the third and successive periods the multiple of 10 shall be reduced in pro- portion as the distribution of the General Exchequer Contribu- tion is based increasingly on  the formula instead of on losses of rates and grants.   In the third  fixed grant period the multiple of 10 would, in accordance with this provision, have been re- duced to a little under six.   In view,  however, Of the continued volume of unemployment in some areas it was  considered that the multiple should be retained  at 10 and that further to assist such areas a &apos;&apos; super-weighting &apos;&apos; should be introduced where the calculated percentage of unemployed exceeds 5 per cent. &apos; 14: It was considered that, this increase in the weighting for unemployment should be accompanied by some increase in the weighting for  sparsity.-   It  is  proposed to do this  partly by alteration of the factor itself and partly by applying it to popu- latiori weighted for children, rateable value and  unemployment, instead of to population weighted for children and rateable value only.  The strengthening of the -sparsity factor is designed to safeguard the position of the counties generally  and to improve the position of the  poorest counties, while at the same time, by making the sparsity  weighting  dependent  to some  extent on the  unemployment figure//securing that the increased  weight Ihow given.to the&apos; factor  to&quot; balance the increase in the unemploy- riient factor will decline as unemployment decreases.  The estimated weighted populations of the counties and county boroughs  for the third  fixed grant period on the  basis of the revised formula are given in Appendix  IV.
Financial results of proposed revised formula.  15.  The financial results  of  the  adoption of these recom-mendations are shown in Appendix V.   These results have been estimated on data as yet incomplete and must therefore be re-garded as subject to revision but they give generally a fair esti-mate of  what would be the new  position.    They show that,as compared with  the  existing  formula,  considerably  more would be  given to  those  areas suffering from prolonged  un-employment  and less to  those areas whose economic conditionsare more favourable.Effect in  necessitous  areas.  16. After taking into account the increase in the General Ex-chequer Contribution, the alteration of the formula,  the mergerof the unemployment contributions and the trunk road transfer,the approximate total gain of the  necessitous areas in the thirdfixed grant period as compared  with the  second fixed  grantperiod would be substantial.  Among the largest of such gainswould be:     Name.Counties.  Cumberland  Durham ...

Adoption of recommendation.  17. In all the circumstances the Government  have decidedto adopt the recommendation to amend the formula for calculat-ing weighted population  on the lines indicated and  it is pro-posed to make provision accordingly in the Bill  necessary forthe determination by  Parliament of the amount of the block grant for the next fixed grant period.                         PART III.               DISTRIBUTION WITHIN COUNTIES.Counties outside London.   18. For the purpose of the second part of the statutory investi-gation,  viz., the method of distribution of grant to the non-county boroughs,  urban and rural districts, particulars of the calculation and distribution of grants to such areas for the first and second grant periods were furnished to the Associations andtypical calculations were prepared for a number of variants of thepresent method of distribution.  After consideration of  all the relevant data  the members  of  the   conference  of financialadvisers found themselves unable to put forward any unanimousrecommendation for  alteration in  the  existing method of dis-tribution,  and  stated  that &quot; whilst  recognising  inequalitiesresulting from the  present method of internal distribution, weare disposed to the view that all the practical alternative methods which have been investigated  produce results which would beless generally acceptable than  those shown by the continuanceof the existing basis of distribution &quot;.   This was subject tocertain minor reservations by some of the representatives and ageneral reservation by the adviser to the Rural District councils association  who considered there should  be some alteration in favour  of rural districts.   The Associations of Local Authori-ties agreed in the  general conclusions of their advisers.   In the  view of  the Minister none of the tests  gave  results which could be regarded as on the whole more satisfactory thanthe present system and each created anomalies and difficultiesof its own.  The county reviews  contemplated by Section 46 ofthe Act have proceeded continuously since 1930 and are not yetcomplete,  but it is clear that the  alterations of boundaries of areas and in  classification have removed much of the cause forcomplaint which might otherwise  have been  made about thepresent distribution of grants to districts.   In all the  circumstances the Minister does not  recommendalteration  of  the present&apos; rules for distributing  grants to county districts.
  As mentioned in paragraphs 23 and 24, amendments of other provisions of the Act are proposed which will be of assistance to rural districts and in hard cases  generally. london.  19. Financial representatives of the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee were signatories to  the report of the conference of  financial advisers and those two bodies are prepared to accept that report.  They recommend the continuance  of the present method  of internal distribution of grant in  London, supplemented  by  a separate scheme designed to equalise over  the whole of  London the effect of derating.  This proposal has been adopted by the Standing Joint Committee and has  the support of  the London County Council.   Compared with the position if the method of distribu- tjon were unchanged, it will afford additional assistance equiva-lent to a rate of approximately  iod.  in the    in Poplar and is. id.- in  Uermondsey, and  substantial sums in other highlyrated areas, with relatively small decreases  in assistance of notmore than the equivalent  of a  rate of rjd.  in the wealthierboroughs.                                              .  - . It is proposed to  make  provision in the  new  Bill  to  enableeffect to be given  to these proposals.                        PART IV.                     OTHER MATTERS.Amendment of Section 86.  20. If the contributions payable  by local  authorities underSection 45 of the Unemployment Act, 1934, are merged in the block grant it becomes necessary to amend Section 86 of theLocal Government Act, 1929, which provides for the periodicalrevision  of -the  total  amount  of  the  General  exchequer contribution.  Amendment will also be necessary to provide foran addition to the General Exchequer Contribution to allow forthe proposed repeal of the male servants&apos; licence  duties  andto allow for the adjustment in the third fixed grant period,  ofthe amount of the General Exchequer Contribution  consequent&apos;on the transfer of trunk roads (see paragraph 6).Grants binder proviso, to Section 89.    .              - 21.  These grants are payable in the exceptional cases wherethe grants set aside for the county district authorities in a countyout of the county apportionment exceed the amount apportionedto the county  out of the  General  Exchequer  Contribution.
Alteration of the formula of weighted population, unless accom-panied by alteration of the provisions of Section 89 would cause a substantial increase in the amount of these grants.   It is pro.posed, therefore, that the deficiency in the county  apportion-ment shall in future be provided partly by the Exchequer andpartly by the county concerned.Additional Exchequer Grants.  Section go.  22. These  grants were provided in the Act of 1929 to ensure to each county and county borough a minimum gain of is. per head over what is termed its &quot; standard sum &quot;.  This standardsum is, in  effect, the amount of the income lost to the area byreason of derating and the  withdrawal of the percentage andother grants  which were discontinued by the Act.   If the needsof an area as determined  by its  weighted population decrease,the standard sum is scaled down in proportion and the is. per head gain calculated on  the reduced  figure.   In  view of theproposed revised formula for calculating weighted population theBill will  provide  that,  for  the purpose of  ascertaining towhat extent,  if any,  the standard sum shall be scaled down, theweighted population of the first grant period shall be calculated as if the revised formula had then been operative.Compensation for losses on account of special and parish rates     (Section 92).  23.&quot; Section 92 (1) (b)  of the Act provides that  a sum equalto 25 per cent, of the loss on account of special or parish rates(as determined under the Act) in any area within a rural districtshall be payable to  the council of tire district by the countycouncil during the first and second fixed grant periods, and that thereafter the sum shall be such as the county council may deter-mine.    It is  proposed so as to amend  the Section that thesum to be paid during the third fixed grant period shall notbe less than the sum payable in the second period.  At the same time it is proposed to repeal the proviso to Sec-tion 9  (2) (c)  of the Rating and  Valuation  Act,  1925, whichaffects the precepts of county councils on a point of detail  as, inthe  changed conditions  since its  enactment, it  has  becomeinequitable in its operation.Supplementary Exchequer Grants (Section 94).   24.  Section 94 of the Act makes  provision for adjusting asbetween the separately rated areas in a county  any increase or  decrease  in the rate poundages due to the  operation of theprovisions of the Act as  regards the  transfer of responsibilityfor  rural highways and  relief of  the  poor,  derating, and the
                                                           2 setting up of the block grant scheme.&apos;  &apos; It was contemplated that the  more  equitable  distribution of the  burden  of  local government under  the  scheme  would result-  in&apos; some  areas losing, i.e. suffering an increase in rate poundage, while others would gain.  In order that the &quot;losing &quot;areas should not be called on suddenly to bear their &quot; losses &quot; to the full extent, the Section provided that in the first five years the  &quot; loss &quot; was to be made good by &quot;added sums &quot; drawn as to one-half  from the gaining areas in the same  county arid as to the  remaining half from the  Exchequer,  the  latter amounts&apos; being called &quot; Supplementary Exchequer  Grants &quot;.  In the following  14 years the  &quot; added  sums &quot;  are reducible by one-fifteenth  each year.                 -&apos;                  &apos;          ::     :r.  These reductions commenced on  1st April, 1935, and since that date certain &apos;&apos; losing &apos;&apos; areas have  represented that in their view the present scheme  of distribution  is unfair to them;  they  have asked that the present system  should be re-examined and that pending such complete  re-examination the  Government should suspend the annual reduction of the added sums.  These representations have received full consideration by the Associations and the Government and whilst it has been decided that suspension of the present arrangements for gradually bring- ing into operation the full  scheme of distribution of  grants to districts would not be justifiable, provision will  be made in the Bill for mitigation of cases of hardship or special difficulty,  such assistance to be provided partly by the gaining areas and partly from the Exchequer. Provision  for further statutory  investigation.  25. The Associations generally are of the opinion that in  view of  the economic conditions at  present existing in  some areas which  the proposed  alterations in  the formula  of  weighted population are largely designed to meet and the prospect of sub- stantial improvement in those  areas, it is advisable that theformula and the method of distribution within the counties should again be reviewed.  The Minister is  of opinion that it would be reasonable to provide for  a further statutory investigation before the whole of  the General  Exchequer  Contribution is distributed on the basis of the formula for weighted population,  i.e., at the end of the third or the fourth fixed grant periods as  may be determined. Co-operation of local authorities.  26. In reporting to Parliament the results of the investigation into  the working of  the block grant scheme  as required by Section no of the Act the Minister  feels that he should place on
record the fact that this investigation, which has occupied overa year, has in his view been thorough in all its aspects and thatthe part taken  in it by  the local authorities has been of thegreatest  value.   The  many  complex problems  have  been examined,  facts  and  figures  analysed  and  compared andevidence sifted impartially with a general desire to proceed con-structively through the various stages of the investigation.  Theunanimity of the recommendations of the Associations of LocalAuthorities, the London County Council and the Standing JointCommittee  of Metropolitan Boroughs  on the main questions is evidence of the public spirit in which they  have examined fromthe point of view of the common good a subject which  affordsground for so much divergence  of views.

                              APPENDIX I.              Section no of Local Government Act, 1929.  The Minister shall,  before  the  expiration  of  the second fixed grantperiod, in consultation with such associations of local authorities as appearto him to be concerned and with any local authority with  whom consulta-tion appears to him to be desirable,  cause  an investigation to be made into the  working of the rules contained in  Parts III and IV of the fourth schedule to this Act, and of  the provisions of paragraph (6) of sub-sec-tion (1)  of section ninety-eight of this  Act,  and shall cause a report ofthe result of the investigation to be laid before Parliament.                              APPENDIX II.                      Local Government Act,  1929.                       Extracts from  Cmd.  3134.  7. The Government have .  . . come to the conclusion  that  the neces-sary accompaniments of the  derating scheme are (a)  some modificationof the basis and method of  Government contribution  to local  services;(b) arrangements to meet the case of  the necessitous  areas; (c)  arrange-ments to obviate the difficulties of those Authorities whose finances are ontoo narrow  a  basis:  If the case  of necessitous areas is to be met, a  new method of distribution of Government grants  and reorganisation of adminis-trative arrangements  are  both requisite .  16. .      In the  Governments view a proper  system  of  Exchequer Grants    should          (a) recognise that a fair contribution should  be made from the         Exchequer towards the  cost  of local services;          (6) ensure that Local Authorities have complete financial interest         in  their administration;          (c) be adapted in  its working to  the  needs  of  the areas;          (d) permit  the greatest freedom  of local  administration  and         initiative;          (e)  provide for sufficient general  control  and advice from the         Central Departments  to ensure a  reasonable standard of  perform-         ance.Amount  of  the Grant.   20. The  total  sum to  be distributed annually  as  the new grant in aid of  revenue  for  the first  quinquennial  period will be made  up of        (i) the estimated  loss of rates  due to  derating  which would have     been incurred  by all local  authorities in the year  1928-29  (taken     for  the purposes of  the  scheme  as  &apos;&apos; the standard  year  &quot;) on the     assumption that  the proposed local  government  changes had been     in operation in that year,  and that  the Valuation List in  force on     the  1st October,  1929, had been in force in that year;       (ii) the assigned revenue grants payable for the standard year other     than the grants specifically  applied to  education  and police services     and the Local Taxation Licence Duties not passing through the Local     Taxation Account;       (iii)  the Agricultural Rates  Acts Grants payable for the  standard     year;      . (iv)  the Health Percentage Grants payable for the standard year;
       (v) the classification grants for Class I and Class II roads, in London     and county boroughs,  and the maintenance  grants for scheduled roads     in county districts payable for the standard year;       (vi) an additional sum of new money amounting  to ^5 millions for     England and Wales. Apportionment  among Counties and County Boroughs.   21. It is  proposed  that  the whole  of  the  new grant in aid should in the  first place be apportioned among Counties and County Boroughs, this apportionment being,  ultimately, according to a formula based 011 general characteristics,  independent  of actual expenditure.   . In  deciding  what characteristics  should be adopted  and what  weight should  be  given  to each, the aim  has been  so to adjust the distribution of  this  new revenue as to make  the  assistance vary with the need for local government services in any area in relation to the ability of the area to meet the  cost.   After a careful examination of a wide range of possible factors, a combination of population, the proportion to the total population of children under five years of age and the rateable value per head of population has been taken as the main framework  of  the  formula.                       -   To these  factors  of general application  have  been added two further factors  of a special character, the one to allow  for the  additional burden thrown upon certain areas  by abnormal unemployment,  and the other for the considerable variations  in the cost of  certain local government services arising in administrative countries from the differing  density  of the popu- lation.   ... &apos;  22. These factors  are  combined in the  proposed formula so as to arrive at a &quot; weighted population &apos;&apos; for each County Borough and Administrative County,  and, when the  scheme is  in  full operation,  the total sum avail- able will be  apportioned among the county boroughs and the administrative counties  on  the basis  of weighted population.   Owing; however,  to  the  very  irregular  distribution, of  the  existing revenues to be  replaced by the formula  grant,  it is considered that too great a  disturbance in  local finance would be  caused  by introducing a complete allocation  on this basis at one step.   It is  accordingly proposed during the . first fifteen  years of the scheme,  to  base the grant allotted to county boroughs  and county  councils partly on the present distribution of these  revenues  and partly on the formula.   For the  first  quinquennial period*  the  fixed annual grant will be made up of two parts.   The first part will be equivalent to 75  per cent,  of  the loss  of  rates and grants in the standard year  .  .   .   the  second part,  which in  total will  com- prise  the equivalent  of  25 per cent,  of the  loss  of  rates and grants and the whole of the new Exchequer money, together roughly one-third of the whole grant, will be distributed according to the formula. On each subse- quent revision it is proposed that more and more of the total  grant should be distributed on  formula until by  rQ45  the whole  would be distributed entirely on  this basis.   23. The full  formula proposed is as follows:        (r) For each county and county borough a figure of  weighted popu-    lation is arrived at by  increasing the  population in the standard year    as estimated by the Registrar-General           (a)  by the percentage by which, at the last previous Census, the        number of children under five years of age per 1,000 of the popu-        lation of the  area exceeded 50, and  * In the Bill  as  eventually passed  it was provided that,  instead of eachgrant period being for  five years,  the  first two grant periods should be ofthree and four years respectively, subsequent periods being  five years.
           (&amp;) by the percentage  by  which, according  to the  Valuation         List in force on the ist October, 1929, or on subsequent revisions         of the grant in the year  prior to the revision, the rateable  value  :       per head of estimated population of the area is below   10.    The population so increased is further weighted            (c) for unemployment; the number of  unemployed insured  men*         is expressed as  a percentage of total  estimated population, and         where this percentage, averaged over three years,  exceeds i   per         cent., the population increased by  (a) and (6) is further increased         by a percentage  equal to 10 times the excess over i  per  cent.,    and in administrative  counties  other  than  London,           (d) for low density of population; where  the  estimated popula-         tion  per mile of roads is less  than 100  persons,  the  population         increased  by (a) and  (b)  is further increased by  the  percentage         by which  the estimated population per  mile of  roads is less than         200  persons,  and,  where  the estimated  population per mile  of         roads is 100 persons or more, by the percentage which  50 persons         bears to the  estimated population  per  mile of  roads.       (2) The total amount of the formula grant allotted to each county    borough and to each  administrative county will be x pence multiplied    by its weighted population.    (The money  factor x pence  will be    determined   by the total sum for England  and Wales available  for    distribution  on the  formula basis).Distribution  to  Borough  and. District Councils.  24. Out  of  the total  amount allotted to each  administrative county, agrant will  be  made to each non-county borough  and urban district council at a  uniform figure per head of actual population, and to  each  rural district council   at  one-fifth  of that  uniform figure per  head  of  actualpopulation.  The. uniform figure  will  be one-half the amount ascertainedby dividing the  total  grant allotted to all  administrative  counties outside london  by the  aggregate actual  population  of  the  counties.  The aggre-gate of the grants  to the borough, urban  and rural district councils will then be  deducted from the grant appropriate to the administrative countyas a whole, and the balance  will be the grant payable to the county councilin aid of  the general  county  rate.  These proposals  in  regard to  the distribution of grant  within eachadministrative county have been  framed with special reference to the veryconsiderable  changes in the incidence of rates within the  county involvedin the transfer  of  poor  law and  certain highways to the county councils.In the great  majority of  cases rural districts would, on balance, obtain alarge measure of relief  from  this widening of  the  area of charge at  theexpense  of boroughs  and urban district councils,  who would not onlyb.e required to bear their rateable share of  the heavy expenditure on ruralroads  transferred  to the county, but would  also remain  responsible fortheir  own unclassified  streets.    In  addition,   urban authorities  will  beresponsible for carrying on  other  services not ordinarily provided in rural districts.   The distribution  of  the grant to borough and  district  councilson  an actual population  basis and the calculation  of grant to the rural districts  at one-fifth only of the  amount  per  head applicable to  urban districts are  considered  to  provide  an  adequate differentiation betweenurban districts and a reasonable and equitable balance between urban and rural interests.   The grant payable to borough  and  district councils  underthe distribution  will ordinarily be in excess of  the  actual loss of districtrates due  to  derating,  and will  be applied by  them in aid of the totalrates required to  be  levied  in their  areas.  * In the Bill  as eventually passed it  was provided that  to the numberof unemployed  insured  men there should  be added 10 per cent, of thenumber  of unemployed  insured women.
                                  ig                                  **additional and Supplementary Exchequer  Grants.  26. It is also proposed that in  the case  of  any  county  borough or administrative county  (as a  whole),  in which the allotted  grant in aiddoes  not exceed the aggregate loss of  rates  and grants in the  standardyear  by a  sum equivalent to is.  per  headof actual population . ofthearea,  the allotted  grant shall  be  increased by such a sum. as will bringthe net gain up to the  equivalent of is. per  head  of  the population.  As  regards  borough  and  district  councils  within  the  administrativecounty,  it would,  in view of  the  wide  variation in the present poundageof rates in any one county, be impossible to guarantee that in every areathere should be a  decrease of rates  consequent on the  introduction of thescheme.&apos;  Clearly,  with equalisation  of&quot; certain  charges  throughout  thecounty,  some  areas  will  gain and  others  will lose, but it is desired to spread  the  full financial  effect of  the  scheme over as-long  a  period aspossible.    It  is,  therefore,  proposed  that,  if  the calculated, total ratepoundage in  the standard  year in any county area  shows  an  increaseresulting from the scheme,  a  separate  special grant shall be  given to thearea  of the money equivalent of the increase.   One-half  of  the  separate :special  grant  in each county  will be  found  by the Exchequer  and  the other half by  deduction from the  population grant otherwise payable, tothe areas in  the county  in which  the calculated  rate poundage in  -thestandard year  shows a reduction resulting  from the scheme.   The deduc-.!tion  from  the  population grant to  these  areas will  be  proportional to jthe money  equivalent  of  the  rate reductions in these area&apos;s.  If, in  thecase of any area, the appropriate deduction  exceeds the population grant -payable to  the area, the excess will be found by the Exchequer.  The :special grant and the deductions from the population grant will be reduced &apos;by 1  / 15th  each year.   In  this way, while  certain areas  will  receive  a ,substantial relief from  the outset, no area will, suffer an increase of rate ipoundage by  reason of the scheme when it first comes  into operation, :and the necessary adjustments will be  spread  gradually over  a period of :15 years.
