Report  by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.    THE Cabinet, at a Meeting* held on the 16th  December, 1936, had underconsideration the following Papers :      (a)  Memorandum by the Secretary of State  for War on  the Organisation,          Armament and Equipment of the  Army.    (b)  Memorandum by the Secretary  of  State for War  on the  Role of the          British  Army.    (c)  Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer  on the Role of the          British  Army.    (d)  Further Memorandum by the Secretary of State for  War  on the Role          of the British Army.    2.  The Conclusions recorded  by the Cabinet were as  follows:    &apos;&apos; (a)  That with a view to providing material for an early decision the Minister          for Co-ordination of Defence should,  early in the  New  Year, invite          the Chiefs of Staff Committee to  consider  further  the role of the          British  Army in time of war.    (b)  That the reference to  the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee  should be          concerted by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence  with the          Chancellor of the Exchequer.&quot;    3.  With reference to Conclusion (b) the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister  for  Co-ordination of  Defence  inserted the following Terms  ofReference: -  &quot; (a)  To consider and report on the role of  (a)  the Regular Army, and (b) the          Territorial Army in war with a view to an early  decision  as to the          nature of their equipment and the  priority which should be accorded          to it in the placing of orders for the equipment and maintenance of all          the Forces of the Crown, having special regard to the following :             (i) The desirabilitynf planning beforehand what forces of all kinds                should be available for active service  on  the outbreak of the                major European war.                         * Cabinet 75 (36), Conclusion 6.

           (ii) The nature and quantity of the equipment and reserves (both of                 material and personnel) required to enable                     (a) any given land force,                     (&amp;) any given air striking force,                 to be available on the outbreak of war and to be maintained in                 the field.           (iii) The requirements of home defence and of the defence of overseas                 ports and garrisons.           (iv) The time required for the transport of a field Force of any given                 size to the  Continent,  and the  time likely to be available for                 that purpose after the outbreak of war.            (v) The. relative merits as a deterrent of                     (a) a land force, and           .                     (&amp;) an  air force,                 to be provided at an equivalent expenditure.    (&amp;)  In so far as it may be contemplated that the Territorial Force would  take           part in a major European war immediately on the outbreak of war            to consider and report what type of equipment the force would require           at the outset,  and how  far the force could be trained in  the effective           use of that equipment in peace time.&quot;                  . The  General Role of the British Army.    4.  The general role of the  British Army is defined in the statement Relatingto Defence (White Paper cmd..  5107, March 1936, paragraph 30) in the following-terms :-         &apos;&apos; The Army has three main functions to perform :  it has  to maintain    garrisons overseas in various  parts of the Empire;. to provide the military    share in home defence and internal security; and, lastly, in time of emergency    or  war to provide a properly equipped force ready to  proceed overseas    wherever it maj&apos;- be wanted.&quot;    5.  It has never been suggested that the  first two of the above functions canbe performed without an army; while, as to  the third, the recent emergencies inEgypt and Palestine  have incontestably proved that there will always  be  callswhich must be answered by the Army.   We, therefore, consider that the above-quoted definition provides.an admirable starting point for the examination of the specific problems which have been  remitted to us.                   The Regular  Army: Its normal duties.    6.  In any  consideration  of  the  role of the British Army in  war  it isnecessary to bear in mind  the normal  peace duties  of  the Regular Army inconnection with general Imperial  Defence, namely, the provision of  garrisons atdefended ports and other parts of our far-flung Empire.    7.  These  garrisons, as now constituted,  are of  the  minimum strengthcompatible with their function  and depend in a large measure for their efficiencyas preservers of the peace on the certainty that they can be immediately reinforcedin  an emergency.  In fact,  the essence of  our  military  organisation is quickreinforcement which enables the smallest possible garrisons to be  maintained atany given spot.                        Strength  of the Regular A rmy.     8.   The only reserves available for such  reinforcement are those units of theRegular Army which happen to be stationed in Great Britain at the time.  these units exist primarily for the purpose of training and  supplying the draftsnecessary to maintain our garrisons overseas, and their number is mainly deter-mined,  under the CardAvell system, by the number of corresponding units whichit is necessary to maintain abroad in peace.   In fact, the strength of the  RegularArmy at home is not, and never has been, related in any way to the extent of our
possible liabilities.  At the same time this home force as our only regular reserveis organised into Brigades and  Divisions which  can, if the situation  at homepermits, be sent overseas either  as reinforcements or as a striking force.   Thestrength of this striking force as at present accepted  by the Cabinet  is four divisions and one mobile division.                      Equipment of the Regular Army.    9.  Leaving aside for a moment the question of its employment in a european war, the regular Army in the execution of the normal duties to which reference has-just been made may be required to operate in the Far East, on the North-west frontier of India or in the Middle East, against first-class military Powers suchas. Japan, Russia  or Italy.  For operations  of this character the best  modern equipment is  obviously necessary.  Nor can there be any question  of  restricting the provision of this equipment to certain selected units, since our system demandsthe constant interchange of the units composing the  Regular Army.   From this it follows that the whole of the Regular Army must be modernised.  We have thought it necessary to emphasise this point since we are informed  that thefinancial interpretation of  the approval  given  to the D.R.C.  Report limits the&apos;&apos; mandate &apos;&apos;  for modernisation to such units as happen to be in the force whichis held ready at home for despatch overseas wherever required.                     The case of a Major European War.     10.  After these prefatory remarks  concerning  the normal  duties  of theRegular Army in Imperial  Defence, and the strength and equipment necessary to fulfil them, we now turn to  consider the situation envisaged  in  the Terms  ofReference, that is to say, a major European war.     11.  Assuming in such a war that the most  probable belligerents would  beFrance, Belgium and Great Britain  on the one side, and Germany on the other,our general conception of the situation is that Germany would probably be the aggressor, and would  therefore have the initiative.   Her aim, we think, wouldbe to exploit her  superior preparedness by trying to knock out  rapidly eitherGreat Britain or France, since  she  would not  be well-placed in a long war,  inwhich the sea Powers, as in the past,  are likely to have the advantage.     12.  In the first stage, therefore, we may expect the main German effort to consist  of  concentrated  naval and  air attacks on this country and its trade,accompanied, perhaps,  by a land attack on France, probably through Belgium and holland.  Alternatively, the main German effort may be concentrated against france.     13.  If the main effort is directed against this country we must  be preparedto use all our resources in  order to defeat it.  But we must also be prepared, assoon as it is defeated, to adopt a more offensive role, in order fully to exploit our success.  If,  on the other  hand, the enemy&apos;s main effort were directed against france, we should have to be prepared to render  all the assistance in our powerto that  country and its Continental allies in the first stages of the war.                The Need for Land  Forces in a European War.     14.  This brings us to the  question of the form that our assistance shouldtake.  As to this,  it is not possible, in the absence of experience of  a war betweenfirst-class air Powers,  to say whether  or  no air  forces can stop armies.   much would, of course, depend on circumstances, such as the degree of concentration ofthe armies, the vulnerability of their  lines of communication, and  the relativepreponderance of  the respective air forces.  However this may be,  we are agreedthat the Allies must be capable of placing in the  field considerable land forces ifthey are to stop a German onslaught  on land.     15.  We have heard it suggested that these land forces should all be providedby  our  Allies, and that our  contribution should  be limited to the air and sea.However strong may be the arguments in favour  of such a  course from our ownstandpoint, we must have  regard  to the reactions that  it would cause upon our       [14507]                                                     B  2
Allies.  We are,  for  instance, credibly informed  that the French would beprepared  to support the Belgians with eight infantry divisions and one mobiledivision,  on condition that  a British Field  Force  were despatched  to theContinent; and, though it is undesirable that we should accept such a commitment in advance, circumstances at the time might well demand that  we should do so.Moreover, it is  probable that the French would press us strongly to take someshare in the war on. land.     16.   We cannot, therefore, discount the possibility that we may be compelledto despatch land forces to the Continent at some stage in a war, and perhaps atthe  earliest possible  moment, and  we  consider  that we  must lay  our plansaccordingly.  Since, as we  have already said,  a  Field Force supported by &quot;theTerritorial Army is essential for purposes of Imperial Defence, we can see no over-riding reason why these forces should not be held equally available for a war onthe Continent in case of need.  At the same time, we think it right to say that weshould greatly deprecate the development of such a land campaign, so far as thiscountry is concerned,  on  the  scale experienced in 1914-18 with large nationalarmies.  It is, of  course,  impossible to dogmatize on such a matter in advance,but we think that our  effort on land,  so far as peace preparations are concerned,should be strictly limited to the regular Field Force  supported by the TerritorialArmy.     17.   To sum  up,  we cannot  foresee the circumstances in  which war may break out in Europe, and the decision as to the role of our army  may well remainin doubt until the last moment.  But though we are averse to any commitment, wedo not think it possible to assume that in no circumstances and at no stage of thewar will it be necessatw to send a military force to the  Continent.                      Our Contribution in Land Forces.(a)  Regular Army.     18.   We turn now to consider the strength and composition of the land forces which,  in such circumstances as we have  envisaged,  would  be available for despatch.   The  only troops  immediately available would consist of that portionof the Regular Army serving at home, though it may well be that the outbreak ofa European war might find some or all of these forces employed as reinforcements to overseas  garrisons, a function to which  reference was made at the beginningof our report.  Assuming the most favourable conditions, however, it is contem-plated that, when the  rearmament programme is sufficiently far advanced, four divisions and one mobile division should be available at once for overseas service.(b)  Territorial Army.     19.  Once these Regular forces were despatched to the Continent, we shouldhave no Regular reserve available for Imperial Defence liabilities elsewhere as described  in paragraph 8 above.  Nor could  we contemplate the possibility of leaving our  Regular Army on the Continent entirely unsupported.  Some sort of reserve  is,  therefore,  essential.   Under present  arrangements this  reserve isconstituted by the twelve divisions of the Territorial Army.     The Territorial Army  was referred to  in  paragraph 33 of the  statement relating to Defence (White  Paper Cmd.  5107, March 1936) as follows :          &quot; The  Territorial Army, though generally  regarded as the second line     in our  military forces,  actually provides the  first line  in anti-aircraft and     coast defence at home.  It is  recruited on the basis that it  will be ready to     serve wherever it  may be needed, and if the  Regular Army should require     support abroad, the Territorial Army will be called upon to give that support     serving not as drafts, but in its own units and formations. It therefore holds     an important place in our defence organization,  and it is  the intention of     His Majesty&apos;s Government to  do  all  that  is possible to  encourage its     recruiting and increase its efficiency.&quot;                               Organization.     20.  We are informed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that thenumber of  Territorial  divisions  maintained in peace is not governed by  anystrategical  circumstances.   The then Secretary  of State for War (the late
Lord Haldane) when  outlining in Parliament on  the 25th February, 1907,  his proposals for the reorganisation of the existing auxiliary forces, explained thata General Staff survey had shown that in each of the twelve grouped regimentaldistricts in Great Britain there was material for  a division exactly similar  tothose of the Regular  Army,  and that in the London  and Lancashire districtsthere was sufficient for two each.  The original Territorial Force was thereforefixed at a strength of  14 divisions.  In 1920 the  Government of the  day decidedto reconstitute the Territorial Army on the pre-war basis, the number of divisionsremaining as  before.   The recent conversion of two divisions to anti-aircrafttroops  for the air defence of Great  Britain has  reduced the total number  to twelve.  We are advised that this is the minimum number which will cover  thecountry and provide opportunity for  patriotic citizens  to take part in nationaldefence.    21.  The  great variety of tasks for  which it  might be necessary to  utilisethe Territorial Army  (as outlined in paragraph 19), makes it  impossible  at  thepresent time to fix its  strength on an entirely logical basis.  Its possible commit-ments  are not  susceptible of accurate computation, especially in view  of  the uncertainties of the existing world situation.  It does not appear  to us to  be unreasonable that a force of twelve  Territorial Divisions should be available  forthe support  of a Regular Army of  four  divisions and a  Mobile Division.   Inany case we think the present would be a most  unfortunate moment to disturban organisation which has valuable traditions and has survived the lean yearsthrough which it has  passed since the war.   It may be  that the demands  of  theair defence of  Great Britain will necessitate  further conversions to anti-aircrafttroops, but apart from this possibility we cannot recommend  any reduction inthe number of Territorial Army divisions.                                 Training.    22.  We desire to emphasise that the Territorial  Army is  at  the momentscarcely more than a skeleton organisation.   Its  peace  strength is very low, andit would need large numbers of men on embodiment to bring it up to war strength.It can  only be  trained in peace time to a limited extent, and after embodiment afurther period of at  least four months&apos;  intensive training would be necessary before  it would be fit for service abroad.  It is not contemplated that any part ofthe Territorial Army  would take part in a major European war immediately  onthe outbreak of war.                                Equipment.    23.  We turn now to the  equipment of the  Territorial Army.  We&apos;have pointed out that in its capacity  as the reserve behind the Regular Army  it maybe requned, like the Regular Army,  to operate anywhere in the world.  It should,therefore, be provided with modern  equipment of the same  type as the  corres-ponding units of the  Regular Army.  It is  inconceivable that one  part  of  theArmy should be fighting with equipment of an inferior character.  Many details.however, including the question of the provision of tank units in the TerritorialArmy have not yet been decided  by the Army Council.  It is worthy  of note thatthe most efficient units in peace time in  the  Territorial Army are the artillery and mechanised formations.  This points  to  the  valuable effect on the personnel of the  issue  even of small quantities of modern equipment.  In default of such provision there is a real danger that the force will die of inanition.    24.  We  are  informed that, owing  to  the  limitations of  our industrial resources, it is not possible to equip  the  Territorial Army on any considerable scale in a short time.  Nor is it possible to  equip  one  portion of it more fullythan another,   since  for  reasons of  morale it  would  be  highly impolitic  to differentiate between   the  state  of  readiness  of  its  various  divisions    the equipment available must therefore be evenly distributed throughout the  twelvedivisions of the Territorial Army.  What is needed is a broadening of the present basis of production, which would enable  the Territorial  Army generally to  be equipped up to a certain degree, and would also accelerate the  completion of itsequipment after the outbreak of war.    &apos;   [14507]. .
                      The Time Factor in Modern War.    25.  The need for measures which will enable the  Territorial Army to beready for service at the earliest possible moment after  the  outbreak of  war is emphasised  by the paramount importance  of  the  time  factor  in  modern  war.The Governments  of all the  totalitarian States exercise in peace a high degreeof control over the social and industrial activities of their countries.  They are thus enabled to create in peace what is in fact the machinery of war, and in thisrespect they cannot fail to &quot;secure a great advantage over  countries governed ondemocratic principles.   It follows that a totalitarian State would seek to exploitthis advantage on  the outbreak of war by striking at once with the greatest forceand speed which it could command.  Assuming that such a  State is the aggressor,it will possess the initiative and it is probable that the defenders will have to withstand in the earliest stages of the war a scale of attack heavier than any whichmay subsequently be produced.    26.  In these  circumstances it is  imperative that our  forces  should  bemaintained  in the  highest state of readiness that our resources permit.  The first essential for us is  to survive the opening stages.  The  earlier that  all our forcescan intervene the greater their value, and the knowledge of  this fact in foreigncountries might have considerable value as a deterrent.              Priority to be  given to the Equipment of the Army.    27.  We have been specifically asked to consider the priority  which shouldbe accorded to the provision of  modern equipment for the Army,  both regular and Territorial, in relation  to the  requirements of the other Services.  As tothis, our naval and air forces will almost certainly be the  first to be engaged in operations against the enemy, and it is possible that, at  the outset of the war at any rate, the Army, owing to the needs of internal security and home (anti-aircraft) defence,  could not be  spared  to  assist our  Allies on the Continent.Indeed it is conceivable that the Germans might not engage in a land offensive against France at all, but might concentrate their efforts against  this country.In these circumstances there would, of course,  be  no question of despatchingany British troops overseas.  Nevertheless, as already stated in paragraph  17,we cannot  by any means discount  the  possibility of  the  Field   Force  being dispatched  immediately on  the outbreak of war.   We  therefore  consider thatour aim should be to  ensure that  the Army is  brought to  the  maximum  stateof  preparedness that can be attained without  prejudice  to  the naval and airprogrammes.  Any lack of preparedness of  the Regular  army might lead to thedespatch of ill-equipped British  troops to confront the  complete  and modern equipment of foreign armies.  If we are right in maintaining that the TerritorialArmy is necessary as a support to the  Regular Army, there can surely be noquestion that it ought to be properly equipped for its multifarious tasks.  We donot consider that the Regular Army should be exposed to the risk of employment without a properly equipped force which could support  it in case of need.  Ourexperiences at the beginning of  the last war lend powerful support to this view.     28.  We wish to emphasise, however, that  as regards paragraph (b) of our terms of Reference, there can be no question of the Territorial Army ever beingimmediately ready on the outbreak of war, so long as our present organisationremains.  The most we can ever hope to do would  be  to provide the TerritorialArmy with  such equipment as would enable it to be ready  four months after theoutbreak of war, when the training of its personnel might be sufficiently advanced.We recommend that this should be our ultimate aim.              The Transport of  the Field Force to the Continent.     29.  We have been asked specifically to bear in mind the time required forthe transport of our Army to the Continent and the time likely to be availablefor this after the  outbreak of war.  It cannot, of  course, be guaranteed that aBritish Field Force could be deployed in Belgium in time to  assist  in preventing the German armies from over-running that country. We  have already referredto  the advantage which a totalitarian State such as Germany would have if shewished to pursue  aggressive measures against  democratic  countries, and  this
factor alone would confer  an immense  initial advantage upon  Germany.   the plans of our potential Allies,  however, as  we understand them, should causes considerable delay to a hostile advance and, though the British Field Force mightnot arrive in time to take part in the initial clash,  it should, nevertheless, produce an effect, both moral and  material, which might prove of great importance to the subsequent campaign.    30.   Plans  are being  prepared  which  would, if the  situation at  homepermitted, enable us  to  land the mobile division by  Z H- 7  days  and the  fourinfantry divisions by Z -t-15 days.  These timings depend on certain accelerationmeasures which  are under  discussion and also on the provision of the necessary shipping.    31.   The possibility  of air attack on the British Force during embarkation,passage and disembarkation cannot be ruled out,  but the weight of attack must depend on the degree of  importance which the Germans attach to  the movementof our relatively  small forces. There are many alternative objectives which might appear more attractive to them.   The French and Belgian armies and air forces,for example, might be attacked both in order to assist an offensive by the german armies and to protect Germany itself.   Great  cities such as London, and alsothe British and  French industrial areas, offer more profitable targets from thepoint of view of the quick decision at which we believe Germany will  aim.    32.   Many  defensive and protective measures are open to us.   Dispersionwould be obtained by using a large number of ports on both sides of the Channel,some of them at a considerable distance from enemy air bases.  Measures  could also be taken to  ensure rapid clearance  at ports and also a minimum number ofships at  any one time.  Every advantage will be taken of the hours of darkness.Ground  anti-aircraft  defences  would  be provided for both embarkation anddisembarkation,  and in this respect some degree of co-operation by  the Frenchis to be expected.  Advantage would be taken, as far  as possible, of the protectionprovided by the Air Defences of Great Britain and of existing port defences.    33.   On balance, therefore, it seems unlikely  that the movement of the  force will  be  prevented by enemy action.                  Comparison  between  Land and Air Forces.    34.   We have given special  consideration to the possibility of making  anycomparison between land and air forces, to which reference is made in our Termsof Reference.  We have frequently emphasised in the  past that wars are conducted in all three elements sea, land and air and that it is  impossible to restrictoperations to any one of  these elements.  All three Services have their own roleswhich they must be prepared to fulfil in co-operation with each other.   Land andair forces cannot, in our opinion, be compared  with one another, any more than can the relative  merits of infantry and  artilleiw be compared in a division of the&apos;Army.   We submit that  in this strategical matter finance cannot be a guide.     35.   The  relative deterrent  values of an Army and Air Force  are hardlysusceptible to precise assessment in terms of finance.   Undoubtedly  Air Forces are  an incomparable  offensive  agency, but their effect has yet  to  be proved. Further-and this is an  important point to which due weight is not always given the potential  effectiveness of air attack must decrease as successful defensive measures, both active and passive, are built up to meet it. -  Germany, at any rate, has gone a very long way in the education and preparation of her people in this respect.        The serious effect of the present uncertainty  regarding the Army.     36.   Before proceeding  to summarise our conclusions, we wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to an aspect of this matter which causes  us  the gravest concern   The Committee  of Imperial  Defence at its  285th  Meeting, Minute 2, recorded the following conclusions :    &quot; (a)  That until a complete conspectus of all the requirements of the War Office           in equipment  had been  prepared  and related  to the  productive
           capacity of the country, it was impossible to consider the requirements           in  A.A. guns for the defended ports abroad and the Field Force in           detail.    (&amp;) That  the conspectus referred to in (a)  could not be prepared until the           Cabinet had taken&apos; a decision on the Memorandum by the Secretary of           State for War entitled &quot; The Role of the British Army,&quot; which was           for consideration at the next meeting of the Cabinet.    (c) That when the Cabinet decision on this Memorandum had been taken, the           War Office should be invited to submit            (i) A complete conspectus of their total requirements in equipment.           (ii) A forecast of the extent to which the productive capacity of the                 country would be able to meet these requirements.    (d) That  the Chiefs of Staff in  collaboration with Representatives  of the           Foreign Office should consider the papers referred to in (c) and should           make recommendations to the Committee of Imperial Defence as to the           order of priority in which the demands of the War Office should be           fulfilled, having  regard to the paramount necessity for the adequate           defence of the United Kingdom.&quot;    37.  The  serious effect of these conclusions  on the progress of the re-equip-ment of the Army is pointed out by the Director-General of Munitions Productionin a paper which was recently circulated  to the  Cabinet  (Paper No. CP. 237(36) ).* In view of the importance of the time factor we trust that the Cabinetmay find it possible to reach such a decision on  the role of the British Army aswill obviate the long-drawn-out procedure envisaged in these conclusions of theCommittee of  Imperial Defence.                                CONCLUSIONS.    38.  Our  conclusions may be summed up as  follows :     (i) We re-endorse the definition of the role  of the British Army which was           included in the Statement of  Defence issued in March 1936,  and we           emphasise that  the essential functions stated therein cannot be per-           formed without an army  (paragraphs 4 and 5).  &apos; (ii) The strength of the Army at home is in the main dictated by our normal           overseas requirements in peace.  These forces at home constitute the           only immediately available Imperial Reserve and are so organised that           a maximum striking force of  four Divisions and one Mobile Division           may be available for despatch overseas if required (paragraphs 6-8).  (iii) The Units of the Regular Army are interchangeable and interdependent.           All should, therefore, be equipped to the same scale.  The mandate for           the modernisation of the Regular Army must therefore extend to           every Unit and not only to those who happen at any given moment to         -  constitute the striking force referred to in (ii) above (paragraph 9).   (iv) We are agreed that it is doubtful  whether the German Army could be           stopped by  the  sole agency of any air forces which the French and           ourselves could ever oppose to it and that the Allies must therefore be           capable of  putting  considerable land  forces into the  field for this           purpose (paragraph 14).   (v) We assume that any idea of leaving to our Continental Allies the exclusive           burden of providing these  land forces, and thereby of limiting our           contribution to air  forces however greatly  expanded,  is  out  of the           question for political reasons (paragraph 15).   (vi) It is therefore impossible to discount altogether the contingency of having           to  send military  forces to the Continent at some stage of the war and           perhaps at its very outset (paragraphs 16 and 17).  (vii) If this contingency should materialise the only land forces available, under           the most  favourable conditions, for immediate despatch would be the           Regular  Field  Force of  four  Divisions  and  one Mobile  Division           (paragraph 18).* Attached as an Appendix to this Report.
 (viii) We cannot contemplate leaving this force unsupported on the Continent          or leaving ourselves  without any troops whatsoever  to  deal  with          emergencies which might arise  in other  parts of the world.  It is,          therefore  essential to make provision for a reserve, and  under our          present system  this  can  only  come from  the  Territorial Army          (paragraph 19).  (ix) The present strength of the Territorial Army is dictated by administrative          rather than  strategical considerations,  but we  should  deprecate          strongly any interference with its  existing organisation, which might          have serious effects on its general efficiency and morale (paragraphs 20          and 21).   (x) The Territorial Army has a low peace strength, and would require  large          numbers  of men and  four  months&apos; intensive  training after  the out-          break of war before being fit for  service (paragraph 22).  (xi) Units of  the  Territorial Army should ultimately have the same type of          equipment as  the corresponding Units of the Regular Army (para-          graph 23).  (xii) Modern developments enable our potential enemies to develop a maximum          scale  of attack immediately on  the outbreak  of war.   Consequently,          the earlier all our  forces  can  be brought into  action,  the better          (paragraphs 25 and 26). (xiii) Since it might be necessary  (vide (vi)) to  despatch land forces overseas at          the earliest possible date after the outbreak of war,  the preparedness          of our land forces should  be as far advanced as is possible without.          prejudicing the naval  and air  programmes of re-equipment (para-          graph 27).  (xiv)  So far as the  Territorial Army is concerned, it should be our ultimate aim          to equip it to a scale which would enable it to be ready four months          after the outbreak of war (paragraph 28).  (xv)  It is impossible to equip  the Territorial  Army on any considerable scale          in a short time, but if the  principle of its modernisation is accepted,          the present basis of production  of supply can be broadened.  Mean-          wKile, such modern equipment as can be made available for it should          be spread evenly throughout the  Territorial Army (paragraph 24).  (xvi)  Plans are  being  prepared which would,   if  the  situation at  home          permitted, enable us to land on the Continent the whole of our Regular          Field Force by Z -f 15  days.  We consider that the  movement of this          force would not  be prevented by enemy  action (paragraphs 29-33). (xvii)  It is impossible to equate land and air forces.  Their  roles are not          exclusive  but complementary (paragraphs 34 and 35).(xviii)  In view  of  the  importance of the time factor  we wish  to  emphasize          the serious effect that the delay  in reaching a decision  on  the role of          the British Army is causing.  This delay  gives us the gravest concern          (paragraphs  36 and 37).                                    (Signed)       ERNLE CHATFIELD.                                                   E.  L.  ELLINGTON.                                                   C.  J. DEVERELL.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,    January 28, 1937.
                               APPENDIX.[CP. 2 (37).]            THE ROLE OF THE  BRITISH ARMY AND ITS  EQUIPMENT.              Memorandum by the Secretary of State  for  War.    I CIRCULATE for the information of the Cabinet the subjoined minuteaddressed to me by the Director-General of Munitions Production, which callsattention to the grave consequences attendant on delay in reaching a decision upon the role of the British Army and its equipment.                                                                    D. C    January 5,  1937.    I understand that the  general  question of the role of the Army  and itsequipment has been referred back* to the Chiefs of Staff for further considera-tion, and that it cannot come forward again to the Cabinet until the middle ofJanuary.  I gather also that the  Committee of Imperial Defence  have  not approved our proposals relating  to  further equipment for Air Defence, GreatBritain, the anti-aircraft defence of Ports Abroad and the  new anti-aircraft guns for the field Force, t    I can,  of course, appreciate  the magnitude of the issues involved, and thedifficulties in arriving at definite  conclusions, but I must point out the danger indelay from the point of view of production of material.    If we are to get within the next  two years any substantial quantity of majorequipment, other than that already approved, e.g.,  guns  and mountings, it isessential to take the necessary steps to provide at once for their production.  even now it is difficult to see how this  can be done with any reasonable economy; andin a few months&apos; time, under normal  conditions and with the usual limitations, itwill probably be impossible.    I am given to understand that the present international situation is  one that causes grave anxiety, and I should be failing in my duty if I did not draw attention to the position before it is  too late.  I have, as you know, put forwardrepeated requests  to have the  ultimate requirements  settled, pointing  out  thenecessity  for a  definite  long-term  production  programme.   I  have  madeprovisional arrangements for meeting such forward requirements as I have  beenable to ascertain, but so far none of these forward requirements have received thenecessary approval, and I cannot  proceed  with schemes which are now becoming-very urgent without such approval as will satisfy the Treasury.* Cabinet Meeting 75 (36), Conclusion 6.f C.I.D. paper 1282-B.
