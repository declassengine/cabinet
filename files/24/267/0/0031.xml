THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT                                                       15Printed for the  Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy No.CP. 30 (37).           &quot;CABINET.PALESTINE SITUATION.            Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE,  for the information of my colleagues, an extract from themost recent  letter  I have received from Sir Arthur Wauchope regarding thesituation in Palestine.   The wording of the letter of Aouni Bey Abdul Hadi, after his return from Baghdad and Riyadh, is of considerable interest.                                               (Initialled)      W. 0.  G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,          January 22, 1937.ANNEXURE.Extract from a letter from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary              of State for the Colonies, dated January 12, 1937.                                          Government  House,Dear Ormsby-Gore,                            Jerusalem, January 12, 1937.    YOU will have been glad to hear that  the Arab leaders have, after  manyhesitations, decided to give evidence before the Royal Commission.  As you knowI urged this course at the start but it needed the influence of the Arab Kings to cause  them to change their earlier and hasty decision.  Their action  offers  one more example, were any needed, to show what difficult people they are to dealwith, and I am sure one hesitation was reluctance of the  leaders to  state openlytheir extreme demands and fear that some of their arguments will be riddled inthe&quot; course of their evidence.    The  influence and authority  of Ibn  Saud may well  prove  most helpful tous to  prevent any further disturbances  occurring  after  the decisions  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government are made known.  I enclose a letter  to me from Aouni Bey,the leader of the Istiqlal party, and one of the most extreme and influential ofthe Arab leaders.  I am sure everything will be done to show Ibn Saud that hisconsistent attitude and influence towards moderation is much appreciated by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    The  decision of the Arabs to give evidence  will have a good immediate effect,and so far  as I can  judge should eliminate any  likelihood  of  disturbancesbreaking  out before His Majesty&apos;s Governments decisions are known; whetherthey recur afterwards depends of course mainly on  the nature of these decisions.    You  probably know that Lord Peel has now decided  to spend an extra two weeks or so in Palestine and to leave Port Said on January  24th.    The  Jews and some others exaggerate the  lawlessness at present existing inthe country.   I entirely agree with the views of Spicer, our Inspector-General, as      [14475-]
to the causes of highway robberies which are at present our most serious trouble.There is always a large lawless element among the landless Arabs of Palestine.The recent disturbances increased the poverty of many  of  these  people, and though  twenty highway robberies in December is most regrettable it,&apos; was notunexpected by me.   Most were committed on Arabs, and  there  is no reason tothink that any were prompted by political motives; I am  also hopeful that thenumbers of both highway robberies and burglaries will be  steadily reduced.     I heard from Admiral Pound asking if I would agree to allow the cruiser inHaifa to be absent during February and March for purposes of training, but that:on emergency he could always send a ship to Haifa at four or five days&apos; notice.I replied the Navy had been so consistently helpful to me I was most anxious tomeet his requests in every way possible.  Consequently I should be happy if the admiral withdrew the cruiser whenever he saw fit, and I would let him know ifthe situation demanded another ship later.  General Dill quite agreed with thisdecision.     I held  a  special meeting of my  AdAusory Council this week to  deal with questions of security.  All members agreed that this would be a most  inopportunetime to raise a new Police force of Arabs and Jews. I am reluctant to issue morerifles to Arabs at present,  for  their attitude, should serious disturbances breakout,  is very doubtful.   A separate Jewish force when feelings are so embitteredmight prove a most serious embarrassment.   From this I except the 3,000 (or possibly in future 6,000) supernumerary Jewish constables who of necessity mustact purely on the defensive,  and those Jews whom  the  Inspector-General  isrecruiting for the ordinary police force.     The guarding of our frontiers against smuggling of arms  is another difficult problem.  We think it should be done mainly by an increase in establishment ofour British Police and with this the Inspector-General agrees.  We sent an officer to Egypt to find out how many of the Cairo City Police were  willing to come to palestine but  found only a  dozen.  I shall send you a separate report on this.Spicer hopes by reducing the numbers of British police engaged on normal civilduties to add some 450 to his striking force in times of disturbances.  He is alsotraining 50 British recruits every three months.  I am considering the question ofguarding the frontiers in conjunction with General Dill.    The Trans Jordan Frontier Force are now  assisting the Palestine Police inguarding our Western Frontier : we calculate to wire our Northern Frontier anda small section of the Western Frontier  would cost about  P. 160,000 and wouldtake six months to erect.  I am shortly  going to have a discussion with Dill onthis and kindred matters and will let you know the results.        ******     Amir Abdullah  is in good fettle.   I shall fly there one  day this week forluncheon :  I hear he enjoyed his talk with Lord Peel.     Dr. Weizmann leaves  to-morrow for England.    He  and Mrs.  Weizmannlunched here to-day.   I asked him what he thought of the  Arab evidence beforethe Royal Commission.  Their  evidence was  presented in the crudest and mostextreme form.  Dr. Weizmann  said his  father  was once  acting as arbitrator ina case in Russia. The claimant explained  his case and asked Weizmann seniorwhat he thought of it.   Weizmann replied: &quot;Judging  only  from your  ownevidence you will certainly lose, but after  I  have  heard  the other side perhaps i may change my mind.&quot;     The Arab evidence tended, I think,  rather  to stir up their followers than to convince the Royal Commission.                                      Yours very sincerely,                                               &apos; ARTHUR  WAUCHOPE.
  ;&apos;,,    &apos;         &apos;    ENCLOSURE.      :         ,    &apos;  &quot;           &apos;Bis Excellency Sir Arthur Wauchope,                   Aouni Abdul Hadi,         High  Commissioner for Palestine.                         Jerusalem,Your Excellency,    ..                                   January 10, 1937. &apos;     I WISH to express my deep thanks to Your Excellency for your kind message;of sympathy on the death of my  eldest brother and to assure you that.it.had themost consoling  effect on me, perturbed as I am.  I trust that God the Almightywill protect you against such calamity and will grant you a long and happy life.     I was extremely pleased from my visit to Bagdad and Riyadh.  In BagdadI had close connection with our brethren the Iraqians, in and out of Government.I found out that they are  all unanimous in their opinion that it is  in the great interest of the Arabs to maintain the British-Arab friendship and to foster suchfriendship  at  all times.  In Nejd I saw  two majestic  things :  the desert and king Abdul Aziz al Saoud.     Indeed I have found King Abdul Aziz a great man  of strong character andpersonality, and that  in addition he is  imbued with  wise judgment and enjoysunprecedented measure of  authority over the Arab Peninsula.  I have not seenany one  of stronger  belief  in the  necessity of maintaining the  British-Arabfriendship.  He told me that he was confident that the British Government will,at this time, keep its promise and do justice to the Arabs in Palestine.   It wasa pleasure  to him to  repeat the  statement that the  British  Government neverfailed to keep any promise made to  him.  May God grant that his expectationsmay be justified.                                           ,     I reiterate my heartful thanks for Your  Excellency&apos;s kind sympathy andassure you of my highest esteem.                                  (Signed)      AOUNI  ABDUL  HADI.-A
