THISJ3pJ3UM^                        BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  SECRET                                          COPY NO.       __  CP.17 (37)                            CABINETo           London County Council (General  Powers)  Bill,  1937.Proposed Hotel in connexion with the  Westminster  Technical  Institute                       Memorandum hy  the                president of the Board of  Education.          I apologise for troubling my colleagues with thiscomparatively small matter, and I only do so because it involves a Financial Resolution,          The Westminster Technical Institute, a TechnicalSchool under the London County Council, includes a Hotel andRestaurant School which trains boys as waiters and chefs.The London County Council now propose to develop in the schoola course in hotel management, and in order to afford thenecessary practical experience, to provide a small residentialhotel for twelve guests.  This is a natural development of thework of the school, which already includes a restaurant opento the public.          The new proposal has the unanimous support of theLondon County Council, and is strongly backed by the Hoteland Restaurant Proprietors Association who have guaranteed anannual grant of  750 for 3 years in addition to the  250 whichthey already contribute annually to the School,  The LondonCounty Council estimate the annual cost to them of running the hotel^at  4,000, and have asked the Board to approve  theexpenditure for their grant.   The Board favour the proposal.          It appears, however, that the provision of a hotelis not within the powers of a Local Education Authority underSection 70 of the Education Act 1921,  and the Council have
         accordingly  inser&apos;ced a clause (Clause 120) in their general         Powers  Bill  for  the session 1936-37 taking power as part of         their functions  under Sections 70 and 71 of the Education Act,         1921, &quot;to provide, furnish, equip, maintain and carry on the         business  of  a hotel in conjunction with or as part of their         Westminster  Technical Institute&quot;,   The clause as drafted is         intended  to  secure that  the net expenditure involved shall be         eligible  for recognition by the Board for the purposes of their         grant and the Board are  advised by the Public Bill Office that         it  would require the support of a Financial Resolution.                  Though the Treasury are prepared to be guided by the         Board&apos;s view as  to the educational merits of the scheme, they         feel  -chat there  is general objection to allowing the London         County  Council by Private Bill to widen the scope of the         Education Act,   On the other hand there do not appear to be         any substantial  grounds  for apprehension that Government         support to the present scheme would in fact endanger the         general position.  The scheme is likely to be unique and can         certainly be regarded as a single experiment.  The Board have         no  reason to anticipate  any similar developments elsewhere.                  In view of the fact that the scheme has the full         support of the Trade and of different sections of opinion on         the London County Council, I feel that it is one that the         Board should accept.  I  accordingly desire authority to concur         wi-ch the  London  County Council in the introduction of a         Financial Resolution covering any increase in Government grant         which may be involved in the Council&apos;s proposal.  Such         resolution on a  Private  Bill is, I understand, taken at the         time of Private  Business, and presumably would not be opposed         unless  there was opposition to the Clause itself,                                           O.F.G.S.20th January,1937.                                 2.
