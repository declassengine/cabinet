THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  F&apos;ebruary1937&apos;.                     $SECRET.                                                *         Copy No. 45CP. 44 (37).CABINET.MALTA : DISMISSAL OF DISLOYAL CIVIL SERVANTS:           Blemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    IN view of the recent debate in Parliament regarding the dismissal of certainworkmen employed  in the Royal Dockyards, I feel that I  ought to bring to my;colleagues&apos; notice the  action which  it is proposed  to take in Malta for the dismissal of two  Maltese Civil Servants on  account  of  their disloyal activities.    2.  In the summer of 1936 it became necessary, in the interests of the securityof the fortress, to take  certain measures for the  suppression of pro-Italianpropaganda and  intrigue in the  Island.  In  this connection information wasreceived from the Defence Security Officer, who is an English officer  and a memberof the staff of M.I.5, indicating that two Maltese Civil Servants,  one a Professorat the Malta University and, the other, the Curator of the Fine  Arts Section ofthe Valletta Museum, had been indulging in disloyal activities and intrigue withthe Italians against the interests of the State; and the question  arose of taking-disciplinary action  against  them.    3.  In view of  the necessity of maintaining the  secrecy of the sources fromwhich the information was obtained, it was not possible to  proceed  by the normalmethod of an inquiry by  a  local  Committee.  After  a  full consideration of thequestion with reference to the procedure laid down for dealing with disaffectedcivilian employees  of  the Defence Departments  in  this  country  (see  cabinet conclusion 31  (36) paragraph  8), I instructed  the Governor  that a  special procedure should be adopted in such cases as those referred to above.  Underthis procedure each individual case is to be submitted to the Secretary of state by the Governor for consideration on its merits and for  prior sanction to anydisciplinary action.  The submission is to be accompanied by a  reasoned and detailed statement of the case, and by copies of all the relevant evidence, togetherwith a covering report by the Governors Legal Adviser explaining the case, and giving his opinion as to whether the charges are established.    4.  The Governor of Malta subsequently submitted  the cases of the twoMaltese Civil  Servants referred to in paragraph 2 of this memorandum,  inaccordance with the special procedure laid down, together with a recommendation that they  should  be dismissed from,  the  Service  without  pension.  The  legal adviser to the Governor, in his reports  on the cases, referred to the fact that hehad not interviewed the Secret Service agents who furnished the reports, as theDefence Security Officer  considered that such a course would be detrimental to future intelligence  activities. The Defence Security Officer assured the  legal adviser that the  agents were reliable, and, in view of that assurance, the legal adviser,  while he was  not  prepared to find that any particular fact can  beregarded as having  been  strictly proved, formed the opinion that the cumulativeweight of the evidence as a whole is such that it left no reasonable  doubt that eachof the officials  in question  had  engaged himself in  activities of  a pro-Italiannature, and in so doing had been acting to the prejudice of British interests in malta and in, a manner  grossly improper in an officer of His Majesty&apos;s CivilService    5.  My Legal Adviser has advised  me that he approaches this matter withthe feeling that Secret Service agents are sometimes inclined to provide what they      [14541]
feel is  expected  of  them,  that they draw what  appear at times to be strongconclusions from any given data, and that their  allegations in the present case have not been tested by cross-examination.  He has pointed out that, on the otherhand,  we  are not dealing  with the question of  crime,  but with the questionwhether Civil Servants have behaved themselves in a manner which is inconsistent with their loyalty and duty.  They owe to the Government a greater duty thanmerely  to  keep within the law, and there are many things which other peoplemight do  but which it  would  be  quite improper for them  to  do.   My legal adviser is of the opinion  that, on the whole, there is enough evidence to showthat these two civil servants are not behaving in that manner which is incumbentupon them having regard to their position, that they have been engaging in pro-Italian activity to the prejudice of British interests, and that they are not loyalto their employer.    6.  After a  careful review of the cases I reached the conclusion that therewere  sufficient grounds for dismissal,  but, in  conveying my  decision to theGovernor,  I directed that the officers should be given  an opportunity of making representations against their dismissal, before final steps  were taken to that end,even though it was impossible, in the circumstances, to supply them with detailedcharges.  The Governor  thereupon caused each official to  be informed  that in his(the Governors)  opinion the  official has been guilty of  having acted to the prejudice of British interests in Malta and in a manner improper in an officer ofHis MajestyV Civil Service; that  the Governor proposed to recommend to theSecretary of State that the official should be  dismissed without pension; and thatthe official was at liberty to make any representations which would be forwarded to the Secretary of State for consideration before  the pleasure of the Crown wastaken in regard to the officehs dismissal.    7.  The representations made by the officials have  now been received and considered.  In each case they consist of a flat denial of the general charge and a request for an inquirj-.  I agree with the Governor that the representations donot warrant any reconsideration of the decision, and  I propose  therefore toauthorise  the  Governor to inform the two officials that it is the pleasure of theCrown that they  should  no longer hold their offices.    8.  I think that my colleagues will agree that the action which has been taken and is now proposed in these  two cases is in general accord with the cabinet decision in regard to the  termination of the employment of untrustworthy persons.There are certain differences between the case of the Maltese  Civil Servants andthe dockyard employees in this  country.   The  Maltese  Civil Servants  arepermanent officials who will, by their dismissal, automatically lose  their pension rights;  and the work on  which they are employed does not offer opportunity forsabotage activities, as in  the case of the dockyard employees.    On the other hand,the Maltese Civil Servants hold higher positions  than the dockyard  employees,and it may be argued that the higher  and more  responsible  the post, the morereprehensible the  disloyalty and the graver  the offence.   Furthermore, the circum-stances  cf Malta, its position  as  a fortress  and  naval base,  and its contiguitywith foreign countries, especially Italy, increase  the gravity and danger to theState of disloyal  activities on the part of  any civil servants,  however employed,and make it necessary that any such activities should be dealt with firmly.  Ona point of procedure, while it was not possible in  the  circumstances of Malta tohave the cases inquired into by a departmental Committee, as in this country, theywere carefully considered and reported on by the Legal Adviser to the Governmentof Malta,  who is an English officer, before  they  were submitted to  me by theGovernor.   The Maltese officials have also been given  an  opportunity  of making representations against  their  dismissal; though as I  have pointed out,  it wasimpossible to supply them Avith detailed charges.    9.  As I have already stated, I am satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for the dismissal of these two officials from the Service, and I now propose to takethe final step  in the matter, which,  in view  of the communications already sentto the officials concerned, should not be unduly delayed.                                                (Initialled)       W. O. G.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,           February 1, 1937.
