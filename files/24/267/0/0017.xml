Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    I CIRCULATE  to  my colleagues two  telegrams which I received on  the6th January from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in  the  Union: ofSouth Africa with regard to Union legislation  relating to the  abdication  of king Edward VIII (Appendices A and  B).    The effect of this  Bill is that the accession of His present Majesty would beregarded- as taking place in the  Union on the 10th December, and not,  as else-where (save in the Irish Free State, which  passed its own legislation withoutassenting to ours), on the 11th December.  In all the communications with  theUnion about our abdication legislation they  had given us no warning whateverthat this point might arise.  I according  asked Sir &quot;William Clark, by  telephone,to represent to the Union Government the difficulties to which it would give rise from our point  of view,  namely, that, if the theory underlying the legislation were correct, King Edward VIII was  no longer King when he gave  the royal assent to the Abdication Act passed  here, and that, in fact, it was expressed inthe United Kingdom Act that the Union of South Africa assented to  the enact-ment of that Act, the effect of which was that King George VI did not becomeKing until the 11th December, when the Royal  Assent was given to  that Act.I also asked Sir William Clark to point out  that it could be argued, and in ourview argued correctly,  that under the legislation of the Union of South Africaitself King George VI had  succeeded in the  Union at  the same  time as  hesucceeded here (Appendix C).    Sir William Clark discussed the  matter  with General  Hertzog, but was unable to make any impression upon him  (Appendices  D and E).    It seemed to me most important  to endeavour to persuade General Hertzogto vary his  view and accordingly  I asked Sir William Clark to deliver a personal message from me to General Hertzog (Appendix F).    Sir William Clark has discussed the matter  with  General Hertzog on  theselines and,  although the latter held out no actual hope of meeting us,  he has promised to consider the message carefully and to see  Sir William Clark again.    I shall report any developments, and hope that General  Hertzog may stillmake the alteration which we desire.   In any case I am afraid there is nothing&apos;more that we  can do prior to the passage of the  legislation through the UnionParliament.

APPENDIX A.Paraphrase Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union    of  South   Africa.   Dated  6th   January,  1937.    Received   5-37  P.M.    6th January, 1937.    IMMEDIATE.  No. 2.    Text of  Abdication Bill to be introduced this session sent to me by PrimeMinister&apos;s direction is contained in my  immediately following telegram.    Bill follows Dr. Bodenstein&apos;s theory,  as stated in second  preamble,  thatexecution of  instrument of abdication created vacancy (see my despatch No. 523of 29th  December), and the effect, of  Clause  1 will be that the accession of king George VI took place in the Union on 10th December, and not as elsewhereon 11th December.    I  asked Bodenstein whether  this was  really  the  intention.    The  only alternative was, he  said, to make accession take effect on the date of passing of union  legislation.  I do not think that this was the view taken by Ministers inthe earlier stages of the discussions prior to abdication of  King Edward, butBodenstein went out of his way to say that the foregoing opinion was now strongly held by General Hertzog. It seems to me that as General Ffertzog is committed to this doctrine as to effect of abdication (see also text of Union Proclamation of12th December, enclosed in my despatch of 21st December, No. 511), and as he willnot accept the  view that the United Kingdom Act in any (corrupt  group)  wayaffects  position in the Union, he is faced with these  two alternatives, either ofwhich is both ridiculous and will expose him to political criticism.    Fourth and Fifth preambles are obviously open to considerable objection; I did not, however, comment on them to Bodenstein.    I have ascertained privately that the Governor-General has not been shown the Bill, though he may be furnished with a copy this afternoon.APPENDIX B.Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union of South   Africa. Dated 6th January, 1937.  Received 5-25 P.M. 6th January, 1937.    IMMEDIATE.  NO. 3.    Following is text of Bill referred to in my immediately preceding telegram :-    Begins:  Bill.   To declare the abdication of King Edward the Eighth and toprovide for alteration in the law relating to the succession to the Throne  and forpurposes connected therewith.    Whereas His  Majesty King Edward the Eighth has, by his Royal message of the tenth day of December, 1936, been pleased to declare that he is irrevocablydetermined to renounce the Throne for himself and his descendants, and also has for that purpose executed instrument of  abdication set out in schedule to thisAct and has  signified his desire that effect thereto should be given immediately;    And whereas  by the aforesaid instrument of abdication the Throne becamevacant and King Edward the Eighth ceased to be Supreme Lord in and over theUnion of South Africa;    And whereas  it is  deemed desirable  that the position  created by the  saidinstrument of abdication be clarified and  regulated;    And whereas  the several States, members of the British  Commonwealth ofNations, have agreed to accept the alteration in the laws relating to succession tothe Throne contained in  the said instrument of abdication;    And whereas  legislative effect  has  already  been given  to the aforesaidalteration in  the laws relating to  succession to  the  Throne in respect of othermembers of the British Commonwealth of  Nations;    And whereas  it is meet that the  Parliament of the Union of South africa should also give its assent to alteration in  the laws  touching succession to the throne contained  in the aforesaid instrument of abdication;
APPENDIX C.Paraphrase Telegram to the United Kingdom. High Commissioner in the Union of              of South Africa.  Sent 6 P.M. 9th January, 1937.    No.  7.    The following are Sir G. Bushe&apos;s views on point discussed this morning ontelephone :-m:.  Begins: The South Africa Act which provides for the King&apos;s Government inSouth Africa sets out in Section 3 that the provisions of the Act referring to theKing shall extend to His Majesty&apos;s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of theUnited  Kingdom of  Great Britain and Ireland.   The Status Act has defined&quot; heirs  and successors &quot;  as meaning  His Majesty&apos;s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom  as determined  by the laws  relating to the succession of the Crown in the United Kingdom.  The intention of Section 3 was clearly that the sovereignty  should descend to the heirs  who at  the time  theysucceed  are,  according   to  the  law  then existing,  properly   the  heirs  inthe  sovereignty of   the  United  Kingdom.  To say  that   the  definition  inthe Status Act  has  confined the  succession to  the heirs, who  would  be heirsaccording to the law existing at the date of  the Status A ct, would be contrary tothe intention of Section 3, and would  require clear words showing that intention,e.g., definition might have said &quot; in accordance with the Act of Settlement.&quot;  Onthe contrary it refers to  &quot; laws &quot;  and uses  the expression &quot; as determined  by.&quot;The use of these words, coupled Avith the clear intention of Section  3 of the SouthAfrica Act, seems to make clear that the reference is to the law which at any given time governs the succession of the Crown of the United Kingdom.    The statement by Mr. Pirow  in the Senate, 14th May, 1934,  on the SecondReading Debate of the Status Bill, says &quot; it is of importance that the Union shallclearly define in its legislation that we accept as the  head of our legislature, &amp;c,the King who at present  reigns over  the United Kingdom,  and after his deathhis successor as determined by the laws relating to the succession of the Crown ofthe United Kingdom.&quot; That can only mean one thing, namely, that of recognisingas King in the Union whoeA^er, according to the law at the time, is the King of theUnited Kingdom, and if that is the intention it would be nullified if the definitionhad really, as is now suggested, made  static in the Union the laws relating to the succession as existing in 1934. -Message ends.[14444&apos;j    Be it therefore declared and enacted  by His Majesty the King, the senate and House of Assembly of the Union of South Africa as follows :      1. It is hereby declared that the instrument of abdication executed by HisMajesty King Edward the Eighth on the  tenth  day of December, 1936, and setforth  in the schedule to this Act has, and  has had, effect from the date thereof;that accession to the Throne of King George the Sixth,  as member of the royal family next  in succession to the Throne, took  effect from  such date  and  that everything done thereafter by His Majesty, or the Governor-General as his repre-sentative, in  accordance with the law, is and has always been of full force and effect.    2. The issue of the late King Edward  the Eighth, if any, and descendants ofthat issue  shall not have  any right, title  or interest  in  or  to succession  to the throne and  Section  One  of  the  Act  of Settlement 1700  shall be construed accordingly.    3. The Royal Marriages Act, 1772,  shall not apply to the late King edward the Eighth nor his issue, if any, or to descendants of that issue.    4. This  Act  may be  cited as  His Majesty King Edward the  EighuVsAbdication Act, 1937.   Bill ends.    Schedule contains text of instrument of abdication as in the United KingdomAct.  Ends.
Paraphrase Telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union    of   South  Africa.   Dated  January  11,  1937.   Received  5-3   P.M.    January 11,  1937.    IMPORTANT.  NO. 9.  Confidential.    Reference to your  telegram No. 7 of 9th January.  I had a talk with thePrime Minister yesterday morning for nearly an hour about the Union AbdicationBill and put to him arguments supplied by Sir H. Batterbee on the telephone andin telegram under reference.  I cannot say, unfortunately, that Prime minister was at all shaken by our case, though his arguments in rebuttal, especially as toapplicability of  Section 5  of Status Act, would  not, I think,  have carried anyconvictions to an unbiassed mind.   The trouble is that  General Hertzog&apos;s mind,never very lucid, is nowadays increasingly closed to  arguments, especially, ofcourse, when he has committed himself; and I doubt if he will think it necessaryeven to tell his more clear-sighted colleagues about my representations.   However,in case he should wish  to consult them, I have  followed up  our talk by sendinghim a letter developing our case further so that he can have something in writing.APPENDIX E.Paraphrase Telegram from the United Kingdom. High Commissioner in the Union    of  South   Africa.   Dated  January  14,  1937.   Received  10-50 A.M.    January 14, 1937.    IMMEDIATE.  NO. 13.                                   ...    I have now  received a reply from the Prime Minister to the letter mentionedin the last sentence of my telegram No. 9 of  the 11th January which includedSir Grattan Bushe&apos;s  opinion  about  Section  5  of the  Status  Act.  general hertzog says that he finds himself  &quot;in complete disagreement with the conclu-sions stated therein.&quot;                                              --n.:..itJ;i...    General Hertzog summarises his position  as follows :  &quot; The attitude I take up is that as far as the Union of South  Africa is concerned no change in theexisting law relating to Succession can have any effect in the Union unless theUnion Parliament  has assented to  such change.  When the Union parliament has so assented the provisions of Section 5 of  the Status Act become operative.&quot;    I am afraid that this reply  and the fact that the Prime Minister has now putdown a motion  for the introduction of his Bill  confirm the view  expressed inmy telegram No. 11 of the 13th January that there is very little hope of making any impression upon him.APPENDIX F.Personal  Message  from  the Secretary  of State  for Dominion  Affairs  to    General  Hertzog.  (Communicated through  the  United Kingdom High    Commissioner in the Union  of South Africa.)    SIR William Clark has informed me  of the talks which,  at my request, hehas had with  you regarding the  Union  Abdication. Bill.   I appreciate theposition which the Bill is designed to meet, and the last thing I should, wish todo is to create a political difficulty for you.  But you. will appreciate that we inthe United Kingdom also have our difficulties, and my only desire is to find ifpossible some solution which would meet both your difficulties  and ours.    2.   As you are aware, throughout this difficult business it has been our desireto work in full co-operation with the other  Members of the Commonwealth andto find a procedure convenient to all which would secure simultaneity.  We hopedand believed that (with the exception of  the  Irish  Free  State, where  special difficulties arose) this simultaneity had in  fact been achieved when your Govern-ment (as well as other Dominion Governments) assented to the enactment of theUnited Kingdom Act, which was expressly declared to be enacted with the assent of the  Union of South Africa.APPENDIX D.
    3.  I fully appreciate that it was difficult in the rush of those days for all of us to foresee every point that would arise.   But if, in fact, you had given usa warning that  the  time  proposed in  the United Kingdom  legislation  (sent indraft to ydu) for the Abdication taking effect would cause legal difficulties in theUnion, we would most certainly have  considered further our procedure with  aview to seeing whether we could alter it to fit in with yours, and I have no doubtthat a way to overcome the difficulty could have been found.  But we. assumedfrom your assent to the  enactment of  our legislation that the arrangementsembodied in it presented  no  difficulties for  the Union Government.  Under the theory of your Bill, however, Edward VIII was not King when he gave his assent to the United Kingdom Act, which,  on that  theory, would be null  and void.Moreover, there  is the further point that,  if King George VI succeeded to the throne on the 10th December, in so far as the Union is concerned, it would seemopen to question whether  it was proper that an Act which recited the assent ofthe Union to its enactment should receive the royal assent of King Edward VIII.    4.  It seems to me that when the meaning of your Bill in its present form isappreciated, questions are bound to be  raised here in Parliament and that serious difficulties are likely to be caused for both of us.  I might mention confidentiallythat it was only with the greatest difficulty that I  prevented a Question being asked and a debate taking place in the  House of Commons before Christmas withreference to the difference in time between the Abdication taking effect in theIrish Free  State  and in  the  rest of the  Commonwealth.   I  fear it may beimpossible to  avert an embarrassing debate here, if your  legislation  is now toprovide for the Abdication taking effect in the  Union on yet another date.     5.  I have only been  seeking a way to avoid these  difficulties which wouldbe mutually satisfactory.  Sir William Clark has, I know, suggested to you that,as you assented  to our Act, the Abdication took effect on  the enactment of ourAct in virtue of Section 5 of your own Status Act.  I was advised that on theordinary principle of construction the expression in Section  5 of the Status ofthe Union Act &quot; laws relating to the  Succession&quot; would ordinarily be read as meaning laws so relating at any time when the Act is read.  If this were notthe intention, we should certainly, in  the case of a United Kingdom Act,. have drawn the section differently, e.g., by  the use  of some such  expression as &quot; the laws in force at the  commencement of this Act relating to the Succession.&quot;  Iunderstand that you do  not agree with  this  contention,  and, of course,  theconstruction of a Union Act is a matter for you and your Legal Advisers.  Yet,quite apart from legal theories, I feel sure that you will agree that it is desirablethat we ought to try to find a procedure which  would ensure that the Abdicationtook effect as nearly as possible simultaneously in all parts of  the Commonwealth.In view of this, I venture  to suggest that it may be possible for you to meet us by adopting the following alternative :      (1) To amend the second  preamble to your Bill so that it  reads: &quot;Andwhereas  it was agreed on  behalf of the Union of South Africa that effect shouldbe given to the aforesaid Instrument of Abdication on the 11th day of  December,1936, and it is expedient that the said Agreement should be confirmed and ratified by the Parliament of the Union.&quot;     (2) To amend Clause 1 by substituting  the words  &quot; effect from the 11th dayof December, 1936,&quot;  for the  words &quot; effect from the date thereof.&quot;  I should be grateful  if  you  and your  colleagues  would  take  into  your  most cai^efulconsideration the  possibility of such an  amendment.     6.   I feel sure you will realise that  I am not raising these questions from a legal point of view, but because they raise serious practical difficulties for us. .     7.   I have  stated these  difficulties very  frankly  and am sure that,  as  aParliamentarian,  you will appreciate them; I equally  appreciate your Parlia-mentary difficulties.  The purpose of.this personal and informal  message  is toask you  as a friend to look at the whole question once more, and see  whether away out  cannot  be  found which will complete to  our  mutual satisfaction thesolution of our common problem by that method of co-operation which we  have throughout the crisis so happily followed and which, I venture to think, has been an object lesson to the world of the manner in which free and sovereign Statescan work together.                     .            -      ,
