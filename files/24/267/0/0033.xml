T                                          COPY HPj  M1- S                     EXPORT OBEDITB FOR AFGHANISTAN                McgTmorgndyjn by the Chancellor .of the Exchequer.                     I see no objection to any application for a           guarantee of export credits for Afghanistan being           considered by the Export Credits Guarantee Department and           their Advisory Committee in the normal way, but I fear that           I cannot agree with the view of the Secretary of State for           Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India that it           would be desirable or proper to instruct the Department to           give a guarantee for export credits to Afghanistan even if in           their view and in that of the Advisory Committee such ae                                          -                  *P.26(57)    guarantee cannot be justified on business grounds.                     It has been the invariable practice that the           Export Credits Guarantee Department should conduct its           operations on a strictly commercial basis and so far as I           know, there is no case in which a guarantee has been given           when the Advisory Committee have expressed the view that it           would not be justifiable on business grounds.                     In so far as the proposal under consideration is           based on the advisability of securing the future. Afghan           market for British Trade as suggested in paragraph 15 of           CP. 2G (37), it seems to me that the Advisory Committee of           the Export Credits Guarantee Department should be the best           judges of the value of such a possibility.                     In considering the   political argument, it will be           remembered that when the Cabinet decided that the Export           Credits Guarantee Department should work out a scheme for           giving increased guarantees, for exports to Russia, it was           on the ground that that Department was conducted on a           strictly commercial basis, and that such a scheme therefore                                     - 1 -
 would not  give rise  to  the political difficulties with Germany which a  guaranteed loan to Russia would cause0 Similarly  when  -there were rumours that we intended  to grant a loan to  China  and  this provoked an outburst in the Japanese Press,  we  took care  to  point out that the Export Credits Guarantee  Department was a business affair and had nothing to do with politicSo    Once we depart from this policy in a particular instance  it  will no longer be possible to dissociate the assistance given by the Department to United Kingdom trade from political implications.           Moreover,  it  would hardly be possible to deal with Afghanistan as an isolated case.   If we were to break the rule  that  the Department is conducted on commercial lines in the case of Afghanistan, we should be pressed to accord similar favours  to other financially weak countries,           It is  not  clear hew far Afghanistan&apos;s needs are likely  to  include munitions and raw material but it may be pointed out that the Export Credits Guarantee Department is debarred from granting  guarantees in respect of the export of munitions and is  confined to guarantees in respect of the export of United Kingdom goods,,           If, therefore, it were decided to be politically desirable  to grant a credit to Afghanistan, it could,  in my view, only be done by passing a special Act of Parliament authorising the Treasury to guarantee a credit.           But apart  from the question of procedure,  the proposal is, in my view, wrong in principle.    The political  gratitude  for loans usually evaporatesas seon as  the  money has been  received.    The loanwhich the British and French markets  grantedto .Turkey in 1914 did not prevent Tar-key  Joining                          - 2 -
our enemies a few months later and the very largeloans granted to Austria under the auspices of theLeague of Nations did not prevent Austria fromrefusing to fall  in with the League policy of sanctions in the case of Italy.   Nor did the loangranted to Germany in 1930 prevent the advent to power of Herr Hitler in 1933.          From the financial point of view, the amount involved in the case of Afghanistan is admittedly notvery large, hut the general principle that theTreasury should not dissipate its credit by guarantee-ing loans for foreign Governments save in the most exceptional cases is, of course,  one of the greatest importance.          In conclusion, I attach a memorandum en thesubject which I have received from Captain EianWallace, who, in the absence of the President of the beard ef Trade, is the Minister directly responsiblefor the Export Credits Guarantee Department.                   (initialled)  N.C.easury  Chambers, S.W.L,   26th January, 19 37.
  MEMORANDUM BY THE EXPORT CREDITS GUARANTEE DEPARTMENT.1.   Any proposal that credits granted to the AfghanGovernment  should he guaranteed by the Export CreditsGrarantee Department would necessarily, under the Department&apos;sStatutes, have to be considered &quot;by the Advisory Committee.Such information as is available about the financial resourcesof the Government of Afghanistan makes it unlikely that theCommittee would recommend the granting of guarantees.2.   The suggestion that negotiations should be opened inthe near future with the Afghan Prime Minister, therefore,involves the risk that the Committee  might subsequently decide that they were unable to recommend the grant of any such credits .a decision which would not be conducive to that improvement of relations between this country and Afghanistan which theForeign Office have in view.3.   The Department can only provide guarantees in connectionwith the export of United Kingdom goods,  excluding munitions of war.   It is not clear whether the Afghan Government would accept this limitation.4.   Two general questions, of an importance far exceeding the particular case under discussion, are raised by theForeign Office suggestions that the President of the Board ofTrade need not follow the advice of the Department&apos;s AdvisoryCommittee, and that the Committee need not confine themselvesto financial and commercial considerations.
 5.      In regard  to the  latter point it will he evident that  financial  and commercial considerations are  the  only ones  which, could  properly come before  this Committee, v/hose members  are chosen solely for their competence in this field. It would surely be anomalous to  expect them to take into account political considerations. 6.     As regards the former, consultation with the Committee is a  necessary requirement under the Statutes governing the work of the Department.    It follows that any fpcilities  actually granted must either be as the result of a favourable recommendation by the Committee or in the face of  an adverse report. 7.     In fact  no guarantee has been given except on the Committee&apos;s recommendation,  and to depart from such arrange- ments at this date would, have serious consequences.    In the first place it would place upon the President the responsibility  of explaining to Parliament why credits were guaranteed against the Committee&apos;s rec recommendations.   Secondly, it is unlikely  that the Committee would feel disposed to continue their functions, which in. this delicate field are a prime necessity to the Board of Trade.    Thirdly,  if credits granted against.the  advice of the Committee  resulted In heavy loss,  Parliament might well decide to terminate the Department&apos;s activities.     Such as result would be ofno advantage  to the Foreign Office,  and. would be deplorablefrom the point  of view of our export trade. 8.     The  system intended by Parliament is that which has operated from the Department&apos;s  inception,  and has  been repeatedly endorsed by successive Governments.                         -2-
25th January,  1957.9.         The non-political character of the Department&apos;activities in the international field has recently &quot;been&apos;emphasised on several occasions.  In the case of the recentcredits to Soviet Russia it was thought necessary to make itclear that these credits did not constitute a loan whichmight he regarded by Germany and other Governments as apolitical act of H.H. Government but were a part of theDepartment&apos;s commercial functions.   Similar considerationshave arisen in connection vvith China where it was thoughtessential to be able to assure the Japanese Government thatthe Department&apos;s decision to send a representative to Chinahad no political significance.10c          The purely commercial nature of the Departmentsoperations is well appreciated by Foreign Governments andany departure from these principles would throw doubt uponthe sincerity of H..M. Govtrnmeuc&apos;s declarations in regardto both Russia and China as well as 0&quot;cher countries.
