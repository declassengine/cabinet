This document is  the  property  of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.       ^ g                   Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1937SECRET.                                                         COPY No.CP.  2       (37)46THE CABINETTHE ROLE  OF  THE  BRITISH  ARMY AND  ITS EQUIPMENT      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR     I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the subjoined minute addressed to   -r-me by the Director-General  of Munitions Production, which  calls  attention to the   grave consequences attendant  on delay in reaching a decision upon the role of theBritish Army and its equipment.                                                                         D.  C.   5 th January, 1937.     I understand that the general question of the role of the Army and its equipmenthas been referred back* to the Chiefs of Staff for further  consideration, and  that itcannot come forward again to the Cabinet until  the middle  of January.   I gather alsothat the Committee of Imperial Defence have  not  approved our  proposals relatingto further  equipment for Air  Defence, Great Britain, the anti-aircratt defence of PortsAbroad and the new anti-aircraft guns for the Field Force*j\     I. can, of  course, appreciate  the magnitude  of  the issues  involved,  and  thedifficulties  in  arriving at definite conclusions, but I must point out the danger in delayfrom the point  of view of production of material.     If we  are to get within the next  two years any  substantial  quantity of majorequipment, other than that already approved, e.g., guns and mountings, it is essentialto take the  necessary steps to provide at once for their  production.   Even now it isdifficult to  see how this can be done  with any  reasonable economy ;  and  in  a fewmonths&apos; time, under normal conditions and with the usual limitations, it will probablybe impossible.     I am given to understand  that the  present international situation is one  thatcauses grave anxiety, and  I should be failing in  my duty if I.did not draw attentionto the position  before it is  too  late.  I  have,  as you know, put  forward repeatedrequests to have the ultimate  requirements  settled, pointing out the necessity for adefinite long term  production programme.  I have made provisional arrangements for meeting such forward requirements as I have been able to ascertain, but so far none ofthese forward requirements have received the necessary  approval, and I  cannot proceedwith schemes which are now becoming very urgent without such  approval as  willsatisfy the Treasury.* Cabinet Meeting 75 (36), Conclusion 6.                  t C.I.D. paper 1282-B.
