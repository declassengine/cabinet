THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTDRAFT WHITE PAPER.      STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT&apos; SPROPOSALS FOR EXTENDING FACILITIES  FOR    PHYSICAL TRAINING  AND  RECREATION.                      I.-INTEODUCTORY.   1.  THE Government have  already  announced in general termstheir intention of supplementing the existing health  and educationalservices of the country by promoting measures for the improvementof the national physique, and giving physical training and recreationa more  definite  and recognised place in these national  services.  Ithas been explained in statements made by Members of the  Govern-ment in  Parliament and elsewhere  that the Government  attach thegreatest importance to achieving an increase in the health and well-being of  the nation by enabling all classes of the community  to take their  share in  physical exercise  and recreation.  In  the followingmemorandum will be  found a fuller  description of the steps whichthe Government propose to take towards this end, and of the financialand other assistance which is to be made available.                IL-THE PEE SENT  POSITION.   2.  As  a first  step towards implementing  the Government&apos;programme, the  Board of Education  and  the Scottish  education department early in 1936 issued Circulars on Physical Education.These Circulars were primarily  directed to  the need  for securingsuitable provision for  physical training in the schools, since a  schemeof physical improvement must, if it is to be effective, begin with the child.  Emphasis was laid on the importance of Organisers of physical training and on the  need  for more trained  teachers  and  for theprovision of gymnasia and equipment and suitable playgrounds andplaying fields.  The Circulars also stressed the importance of devotingsome  time each day  to exercises, gymnastics,  games or swimming.These  recommendations subsequently  received  endorsement  in  aBeporfc issued by the  Physical  Education Committee of the  british medical Association.  While much still remains to be done  to place the subject in a  satisfactory position in the schools,  there is  generalagreement  as  to  the lines of  advance.  The machinery  for thenecessary expansion and development is ready to hand, and it willbe  the  Governments  concern  to  urge  on those  responsible  theimportance of seeing that it is utilised to the full.   3.  But however adequate may  be the facilities  provided in the schools,  they will largely fail of their purpose, unless they are  supple-mented  by arrangements for those  whose daily environment of theoffice or the workshop  makes the provision of opportunities for physicalimprovement particularly  desirable.   This  aspect of  the problem,which is one with which the present proposals of the Government are primarily concerned, presents certain difficulties owing to the  variety of agencies in  the   field and  the  disparity  of  the  incidence  asbetween one place and another of  the facilities  which they afford.The  existing agencies  are  local authorities,  acting both in  theireducational capacity and otherwise,  and  a  considerable number of voluntary bodies.   In  certain  areas  physical  training classes and recreational facilities are also provided by the Ministry of Labour forthe benefit  of the unemployed.   4.   Local authorities have a variety  of powers for aiding physical training  and recreation.   As  educational  authority  they  provide&apos;outside  school  age limits  courses  in  physical  training  (includingphysical exercises, boxing,  swimming, &amp;c).  They assist voluntary bodies either financially or by allowing  the use of&apos;premises and theservices  of teachers.   They  can also supply, or  aid the  supply of,social and  physical   training  (including camps,  playing  fields,swimming baths) for young people, and also for any adults who are    [14468]                                               B
attending  an educational  institution.   This power is  being usedamongst other things to  promote the provision  of  youth communitycentres where physical and social facilities are  available for use byclubs and  other voluntary  organisations.   Local authorities in their capacity of health authority can provide playing fields,  and  in  thecase of urban authorities, gymnasia and. swimming baths.   They can also provide on their own  housing estates community centres- withfacilities for physical recreation.    5.   The voluntary contribution to the  problem takes a number offorms.  In the first place, as is well known, voluntary effort has long been instrumental in making in practically every part of  the countrysome provision, through clubs or by other means,  for promoting  thesocial and  physical welfare  of  youth.   In addition, there are a largenumber  of central  organisations  whose  primary  function it  is  topromote and stimulate  local  effort.   These fall  roughly  into  thefollowing groups-:     (a) Associations   concerned  solely  with  physical  training  and          recreation.  These  include  bodies  concerned  with  the          national organisation of all kinds of sports  and  games.  In          the sphere of I physical training they include such bodies as          the Ling  Association  of Teachers, the League of Health          and Beauty, the English Folk Dance and Song Society,  the          Institute of Margaret Morris Movement  and the National          Association of Organisers of Physical Training.    (b) National Associations  not solely  concerned  with  physical          training and recreation.  Under this heading are included          the National Associations dealing with boys&apos; clubs and girls&apos;          clubs, the  Boys&apos;  and Church Lads&apos; Brigades, the  Scouts          and  Guides, the Y.M.C.A., and Y.W.C.A.,  the  Welsh          League  of  Youth, and various other similar organisations.    (c) Certain central co-ordinating and advisory  bodies.    The principal of these and  their functions are as follows i     (i)  The  Central Council of Recreative  Physical  Training includes          representatives  of more than 100 organisations falling under          heads (a)  and  (b) above.   It is concerned to advise as to          the provision  of  suitable facilities for recreative physical          training, to facilitate the supply of competent teachers and          leaders and to conduct  propaganda.   (ii)  The  National  Playing Fields Association is  concerned to dis-          tribute funds obtained from voluntary sources in aid of  the          provision of playing fields both by  voluntary bodies and by          local authorities in all parts of  the country.  (iii)  The  Juvenile  Organisations Committee  is an Advisory  Com-          mittee under the Board of  Education  composed of persons          concerned  with the  social  and  physical  welfare  of youth.          Their function  is  to- survey the problems involved and  to          advise as  to the  method of their solution. Amongst  other          things they promote the establishment of Local Juvenile          Organisations -  Committees  which  include  representatives          both of local authorities and of local voluntary bodies.  The          purpose of these  local Committees is to  explore the needs          of their areas and to  encourage efforts to  fill gaps  in  the          facilities available.    In  Scotland these services are  per-          formed ,by the  Scottish Juvenile Welfare  arid After Care          Office, which is under the control of the Secretary of State          for Scotland.  (iv)  The  National  Council of  Social  Service is also  concerned  in          promoting  co-operation in  the  development   of  social,          educational and recreational activities.   It includes repre-          sentatives  of some 40 national  voluntary organisations;  of          associations of local  authorities and of local branches of the          council.  Its activities, which-cover a wide range of-work,          are most extensive in rural areas, new  housing estates and          localities where unemployment  is  particularly  severe.  In          Scotland these activities, are: carried  out by the Scottish          Juvenile Welfare  and  After  Care  Office and the Scottish          Council  of  Community  Services.
    III.-THE INADEQUACY OP EXISTING FACILITIES.   ().  It may well be asked why, if there are so many  agencies,voluntary and other, in the field, the Government find it necessaryto introduce any special measures for supplementing their activities.The answer, put briefly,  is that without some measure  of central co-ordination of effort  the provision must necessarily  be  sporadic andincomplete,  and that the  funds  available  from  all  sources  are insufficient to cover the ground as fully as is needed.  The calls madeon the resources of Local Authorities in order to carry out the variousduties with which  they  are  charged  make it difficult for  them,particularly in some areas, to  exercise the powers to which  reference has been made above to any but a very limited extent.  As regardsvoluntary organisations, while they are making an admirable contri-bution to the promotion of  the  physical welfare of young people,  ithas to be remembered not only that the incidence and  extent of thefacilities  which they provide vary greatly  as between one district andanother,  but also that their  development is  often  hindered by  ashortage  of funds,  particularly  in the poorer areas where  the  need of physical improvement is  frequently the greatest.           IV.-CEETAIN QUESTIONS OF  POLICY.   7.  The  Government before formulating  their proposals and thefinancial  consequences have had in the first place  to  settle certainfundamental questions of policy.(a) Should attendance be  voluntary or compulsory 1    The  compulsory solution has only to be suggested to be rejected.It is true that  this would provide the only method of  securing thatall boys  and  girls after leaving school should receive some  measureof physical training, but it is wholly alien  to the national temperand tradition.   It is also open to other  serious objections.   Apartfrom  the obvious difficulties  of enforcement  a compulsory  system would involve precise  definitions of the ages between which it is tobe applied, of the extent of the obligation to be imposed, and of thenature of the training to  be undergone.   These definitions  would bedetermined not  by what is desirable, but by what  is  susceptible ofgeneral application to the whole country, and  would therefore tendto create a false impression of  the ideal to be  aimed at and the means to obtain it.   The  aim  of the Government is not to secure that between  certain ages  every boy and girl practises certain  physicalexercises or achieves a certain standard of physical development, butto inculcate  a wider realisation  that physical fitness has a vital part to play in promoting a healthy mind and human happiness.  It is away  of life  and an attitude  of mind,  the  importance of  which  iscontinuous  and  not  limited  to  certain  years  in   early  youth.Admittedly, a voluntary system involves  only gradual  development,but none the less the Government are satisfied that it represents theonly method of approach likely to achieve success.(b) Should the scheme be built up aneic from  the start, or should it       be based on  development of existing agencies ?   It would, in the view of the Government,  be not  only wastefulbut bad  policy to ignore  the  large and varied  amount of  work thatis already being done by  various agencies,  both voluntary and public,throughout the country.   It is evident that the  demands for facilities are of very varying  kinds, and  that if voluntary attendance is to be attracted a wide variety of agencies should be  employed.  A schemeoperated direct  by the State  might  secure  a  greater  uniformity inthe facilities provided, but it  would not achieve its  purpose if,  as  isprobable, it  failed, owing  to its  very uniformity, to attract  the attendance of those for whom it was designed.(c)  What, should he  included within the scope of physical training -y-:    mul. recreation? :  ,-  :.vvv::      ,         &apos;   While the Government  fully appreciate  the vital  importance of physical  training of a more or less formal character;  they  considerthat a scheme  confined to physical training would  fail to; recognise    [14468]                                               B  2
the wide  variety of  the  demands for physical recreation and theimportant part which games, swimming  and other  physical activitieshave  to play in promoting physical fitness.   They have  accordingly decided that any scheme must embrace the  whole field  of physicalculture - and  should therefore  include arrangements  for  increasingthe supply not only of gymnasia, but also of playing fields, swimmingbaths  and other means  of  healthy physical  recreation.   Moreover,it has to be recognised that  many  may desire  opportunities for physical  exercise and recreation not solely as such, but as part of a fuller club or community life, and  the scheme will accordingly extend to combined provision of this character.           V.-OUTLINE  OF PEOPOSED  SCHEME.   8.  While decisions on the  questions  referred to in the last para-graph  are fundamental   to  the  establishment  of  any  scheme  ofdevelopment and State aid, the Government recognise that before thedetails of  such a  scheme can be fully elaborated more information isnecessary than is at present  available,  both as to the nature and extent of  the demand for further  facilities and  as  to the manner inwhich  these demands can best be met.  They also recognise  that if their proposals  are to be successful and are to be developed on rightlines, it is necessary that  they  should have available a body qualified to give expert advice  on  the many practical problems involved.  Forinstance, the science underlying physical  training is  a developing one,and many questions arise as to the types of physical training best suited  to meet the widely varying needs of those who desire facilities.   9.  National Advisory  Councils. It  is accordingly  proposed  toappoint forthwith two National Advisory Councils,  one for Englandand Wales and one for Scotland, whose duty it  will be to survey thefield and to advise as to the needs of development and as to the way in which&apos; they can  best be  met.  One of their  immediate functionswill be to promote the establishment of the local committees referredto in  paragraph 13 below.  They will also be concerned to suggestmeans of publicity and propaganda.   10.  Each National Advisory Council will be composed of about80 men  and women selected  on account of their knowledge and experience of the work  both  of  local authorities   and of nationalvoluntary bodies,  together  with  others familiar  with  the  various aspects of the  problems  involved.   The Councils  will have  power,with the sanction of the responsible Minister, to  delegate any of their powers  to  sub-committees  and  to  appoint  outside  persons  to sub-committees.   11.  Grants   Committees. The  Government  also  propose  toappoint two  Grants Committees,  one  for  England and  Wales andone for Scotland, each  consisting of  three  members  who  will beresponsible for receiving  and  examining applications  for grant andfor making  grants  subject to the  approval   of  the  responsible minister, whose responsibility  to Parliament for the expenditure willbe ensured by its being borne on  the Vote of his Department.  Themembers  of  the Grants  Committees  will  attend  meetings  of  theNational  Advisory Councils, part of whose duties will be to advise onthe general  lines on  which Grants  should be  distributed, and will thus be kept  in constant  touch  with the Councils&apos; views.   12.  The   Government  will  furnish  the   National advisory councils  and the Grants Committees with the requisite staff, whichwill be mainly provided  from  the staffs of the Board  of  education and the  Ministry of  Health or the corresponding   Scottish Depart-ments  as the case may be.  The two bodies will  thus in each countryform another link between the  Departments and will thus be  able tocontribute to a proper co-ordination in handling the problems which he on  the border line between  educational. and health services.   13.  Local Committees. If  the advice and encouragement of theNational Advisory. Councils and the financial assistance of.the  GrantsCommittees  are to/be productive  of the best results, it is essentialthat local interest should be stimulated and local effort co-ordinated.With  these ends in view it is proposed to promote  the establishment
of loeal committees consisting of representatives of the local educa-tion authorities (for higher education in England), of voluntary bodies and of other persons who have special knowledge and experience.   Itis not intended that there should necessarily be a separate committeefor each county  or county  borough, as  it is  considered that thecommittees will be more likely  to attract suitable personnel and  to function effectively if they are appointed for comparatively wide areas,especially in Scotland, where the term .&quot; Regional Committee &quot; wouldprobably be more appropriate than &quot;Local Committee.&quot;   It would,however, be open to any local committee to appoint sub-committees,with  a reasonable proportion  of  outside members,  to  deal withparticular parts of the area served in cases where, owing  to the size of the population or for any other reason,  this course seems desirable.The purpose of the local  committees will  be to examine the needsof their areas and to consider how any unsatisfied needs could best be  met.  On them will largely  depend  the creation of  an activepublic  interest and the encouragement of assistance from voluntary and other sources.  They will constitute  the channel through whichapplications to the Grants Committees for  grants will be  made, andwhen forwarding applications they will express  their views as to therelative importance of the various proposals and the extent to which their  cost could be met  from local sources.  The  proper  procedure,therefore, for any body  of persons, or for  any  Local Authority thatmay desire to institute in the locality any branch of physical trainingor recreation that comes within the purview of the Grants Committees,will be to place their proposals, with  full  particulars of the financial commitments  involved, before the Local  Committee.    14.  The experience of the Juvenile Organisations Committee goesto show that, while voluntary enthusiasm and effort  are very necessaryto success,  they are not by themselves enough to establish and main-tain at a high level of efficiency local activities of the kind which theGovernment  have in view.  For this reason they contemplate that each Local Committee should appoint as. a full-time paid secretary person who  has experience of  the social,  recreative  and physicalactivities for which they will need to provide.   Since the success ofthe scheme will so largely depend on the efficient working of the LocalCommittees the Grants Committees will have power to meet approvedexpenditure by Local  Committees on administration.               VI. ALLOCATION   OF  GRANTS.    15.   Physical Training and  Recreation. The Grants committees will have power to recommend capital grants in aid of projects for theprovision  of  gymnasia   and gymnastic   equipment, together  withchanging rooms  and shower  baths, with any  associated  club  orcommunity centre accommodation.    16.  The rate of  grant will  not be fixed, but will be  determinedafter considering the  financial  circumstances of the  case.    Beforerecommending capital grants the Grants Committees will have regardto the prospect of sufficient funds for  maintenance,-including the pay-ment  of any  necessary  teachers or  leaders,  being found from localsources.    17.  Grants will not be  given to central voluntary  organisations for distribution,  but  will be made directly in aid  of  particular loealprojects.   Only  in this  way can it  be secured that the grants areequitably distributed  between  one  area  and  another and that theneeds of an area are considered with a  full knowledge  of  all local circumstances.   Projects put forward by Local Authorities, equally with  those of voluntary bodies,  will  be eligible  for grant, but if theproposed expenditure will be incurred under the Education Acts, andis thus eligible for the normal 50 per cent, grant in England, or willbe aided by the  block grant in  Scotland, the Grants Committees willhave  power to  recommend supplementary grant  only  in cases  of exceptional need.    18.  While,  as indicated, grants  will be primarily made in aid of individual  capital projects, the  Government  recognise that  thenational  organisations   can exercise an  important  influence  in
stimulating and encouraging local effort.  The Grants committees will accordingly have power to recommend grants to selected nationalorganisations  for  this  purpose  and  to  enable  them  to supervisefacilities provided  by. local voluntary bodies with the aid of grants.   19.  Training  of Teachers and Leaders.-The  Government pro-pose  that  a   National  College of  Physical  Training  should  beestablished.  The  responsibility for the provision and  maintenance ofthe College will rest with  the  Government,  but its  administration,subject  to the  control of the responsible Minister, will be in the handsof a suitably constituted  Governing Body.   The primary purpose ofthe-College will be the training of leaders to organise and undertakeRecreational Physical Training, but  it  should ultimately have  aninfluence over the conduct of physical education of all kinds through-out the country.  It is contemplated,  for instance, that  the  Collegeshould investigate some of the many outstanding problems connectedwith  the  physiology of  physical training.   While  the  training of teachers for the schools will not be  one of the main purposes of the college, it will be utilised for helping  to make good any deficiencies in the  supply  of  elementary school  teachers trained in the use ofgymnastic  apparatus  or   of physical training  teachers  for boys&apos;secondary schools.  Although the admission of women to the  Collegeis not excluded, its main  function would.be to train men, since therealready exist a number of specialist colleges  of physical training  forwomen.   In Scotland there are at  present two  Colleges  for  thetraining of school  Instructors in Physical  Education, one for men andone&apos; for women.   So far as can be foreseen at j)resent no  further provision of Colleges will  be necessary, though the  possibility ofextensions at the existing Colleges may have  to be considered.   20.   Further investigation may also show  the desirability of aidingcertain  University and other training institutions to,provide the accom-.modafcion necessary to  enable them  to give  physical instruction  onmodern lines.   21.   The Grants Committees will have power to recommend grants to the Central Council of Recreative Physical  Training     (a)  to enable them to supplement other provision for training by          providing or aiding the  provision  of Courses designed to          -improve the qualifications  of teachers and  leaders.   These          functions will be  of particular importance during the period          that must elapse  before the proposed  Training College is   :-      established;    (h):  to- provide expert  advice  as to forms of physical training and          recreation;    (c) where  necessary to  aid the provision  of adequate salaries  for           teachers and leaders.   Although it is contemplated that as a           rule the salaries of teachers  and leaders will be met by  the           Local Authority or from voluntary sources, the Government           recognise that  there may be  cases  in which  the  locality           cannot  reasonably be  expected to find the necessary funds           without some assistance;    (d)  for expenses involved in  discharging the above duties.    22.   Playing Fields. As already  indicated, the National  playing fields  Association  have  a  long experience  of the  many technical questions involved in aiding  the provision of playing fields, and it is accordingly proposed that the Grants Committees should have powerto recommend a  grant to  the  Association,  and to make that bodyresponsible for considering applications and  distributing grants in  aid of the provision of playing fields.  Care  will be taken to secure  thatany  grants made in aid of the provision  of playing  fields do  notoverlap or interfere with the grants for playing fields to  be made fromthe.  King George V  Memorial Fund. The Grants Committees will also have power to recommend a grant  to the Association  in  aid of any additional administrative  expenses involved.    23.   Swimming Baths.-^-The Grants.Committees  will have powerto recommend grants in  aid  of the provision of swimming baths.   Itmay be-expected that in  the  main/these  will&apos; be provided, as. atpresent,, by local  authorities., and in deciding whether. the  case is one for  a grant,  and if so,   what  the amount should  be,  the Grants
Committees will, have regard both to the financial position of the area and to the anticipated revenue from the use of the bath.    24.   Other Facilities:^--The Grants Committees will have power torecommend grants to either central or local bodies as may seem most appropriate hi each case in aid of the provision of camping sites  andother facilities for physical  recreation.                         VII.-FINANCE.    25.   The Minister  responsible to Parliament will,  in  Englandand Wales, be the President of  the  Board of Education, who  will consult: with the other&apos;Ministers concerned as&apos; occasion  arises&apos;.&apos;   InScotland the Secretary of State will  be the responsible Minister.    26.   Any  reliable  forecast of  the  expenditure involved  in  theproposals outlined above  is impossible, if only because the scope ofthe  problem cannot  be  accurately  determined  until the  National,Advisory-Councils have surveyed the field and advised as to the best methods for meeting-the needs of development.   Any estimate must therefore  be provisional  and subject to correction  in  the light of experience-.   Subject  to this qualification, the  Government considerthat the necessary capital-grants would be&apos;of the order of two millionpounds spread over a period of about three years, and that in addition-there would be certain continuing annual charges which it is not easy to estimate but which might be  in the  neighbourhood of  150,000.It is clear that the expenditure in the first year will be substancially lower than  in a  full  year.   Time  for preparation will be necessaryeven  in regard to such matters as training  classes for teachers  andleaders.  In the case of capital expenditure a considerable time must elapse between approval of a scheme  and the date when a grant firstaccrues for payment.   Moreover, a certain interval will occur beforelocal  committees  are  established  and in a  position to advise uponparticular proiwsals.              VIII.-SUMMARY  OF  PROPOSALS.   27.  The following measures will  be taken at once :    (1) The  establishment of the two  National  Advisory  Councils to          survey  the field  and advise  as to the  best  methods  of          meeting the needs and the general lines  of advance.   (2) The  establishment  of the two  Grants  Committees  through          whom,  subject to the approval of the  responsible Minister,          grants will be payable.   (3) The organisation by the  National  Advisory Councils, of  Local          Committees to  develop  and co-ordinate the work in  the          various localities and advise the  Grants Committees on  the          distribution of local grants.   (4) The establishment  of a National College of Physical Training.   (5) A grant to the  National Playing Fields Association.   (6) An interim grant to the Central Council of Recreative Physical         Training.   Legislation will be introduced for the following  purposes :-   (1) To enable  the  Grants Committees,  subject to the  approval of         the responsible Minister, to make capital grants to voluntary         bodies and  local  authorities  and  for certain  purposes  to         make annual grants  to national bodies, local authorities         and the Local Committees.   (2) Local  Authorities will be  empowered to  exercise  throughout         their  areas  the  same  powers of providing (or aiding the         provision of) community centres as they have in connection         with their housing estates.   (3) County Councils in England and  Wales  will be  empowered.         to contribute towards the cost of  county district councils in         the exercise  of their powers -under the  Bill and their  power          of providing swimming baths.   (4) The limitation now  imposed under Section 86 of the Education         Act, 1921,  under  which local  education authorities  can
          provide  (or  aid  the  provision of)  physical  and  social          facilities for  persons over 18 years of age only in so far          as they  are  attending  an educational institution, will be          removed.    (5) In  Scotland the powers of local authorities will be extended          so that effect may be given to the proposals of this  scheme.                       IX. CONCLUSION.    28.   Such in outline is  the Government&apos;s scheme  for providingand extending facilities for physical  training and recreation.  Theexisting provision of such facilities is at present insufficient in amount and sporadic in its incidence, and, hampered as it is by lack of funds for  development,  cannot do  more  than  touch the  fringe  of  theproblem.  It is to make good these  deficiencies that the Governmenthave put forward these proposals.  But they will clearly fail of their purpose  unless  the fullest  use  is  made of  them  by the  existingagencies, whether voluntary bodies  or local authorities.  Their taskwill be a two-fold one- first to  create in the public mind a realisation of the value of  physical  fitness for its  own sake, and, secondly, toprovide facilities  sufficiently  attractive to make an effective appeal tothe people  of the country.   The Government  hope and believe thatthe&apos; attainment of these ends will be brought nearer by  the measureshere proposed.
