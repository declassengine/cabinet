CABINET.                      PROGRESS IN DEFENCE REQUIREMENTS,            Memorandum by the Minister for the Co-ordination of                                Defence.               In accordance with the wish of the Cabinet as recorded      in the Cabinet Minutes of loth January, 1937,  I submit a      memorandum as to the state of the re-armament  programme.               On 25th February, 1956, the Cabinet arrived at a      number of conclusions with regard to the Report of the      Ministerial Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements      recommending measures to be taken in the next  three to five      years to modernise our national defences.   The Cabinet      decisions were liable to modification in the light of new      circumstances.               The main decisions were as follows:-      Navy;         (i) Seven new Capital  Ships in the period                         1937-39.                  (ii) Four new aircraft  carriers 1936-42.                 (iii) Increase of Fleet  Air Arm from 190 to                         357 in 1939 and  504 in 1942.                  (iv) Five new cruisers  a year.                   (v) Flotilla of destroyer leaders 1936-37                         and in each alternate year  up to 1942.                  (vi) Three submarines a year.                 (vii) Modernisation of seven Capital Ships.                (viii) Reserves of aimminition and equipment.      Army:         (i) A Regular Field Force Contingent  of four                         Divisions:   a re-organised  Cavalry                         Division of mechanised units:   and two                         Air Defence Brigades:   the  whole to be                         provibled with modern armament,  including                         Bren guns,  and material,  and available as                         soon as possible after outbreak of war.                         The whole to be  completed in a  five year                         period and  as much as possible  by April,                         1939.                                    -1-     s.
             (ii) Re-equipment of Field Artillery with                    25 pounder guns*Air Force;.    (i) Completion of 123 squadrons&quot; (1512 first line                    aircraft) &quot;by April 1937, as approved in                    May 1935, with subsequent increase to                    1736 first line aircraft, for R. A.F.                    strength at home..:             (ii) Provision of 12 additional squadrons at                    various overseas stations.            (iii) Reserves of 200 per cent, of first line                    strength.            The further increase in strength at home from              1512 to 1736 first line aircraft and. the measures              under (ii) and (iii) were to be completed by              April 1939.        The White Paper of 3rd March, 1936, did. not disclose the full extent of these decisions.  As the Cabinet maylike to be reminded of the information which was given toParliament, the following summary is given:-Navy;          (i) Two capital ships to be laid down early                    in 1937 after the expiry of the London                    Naval Treaty.             (ii) One aircraft carrier to be laid down at                    an early date,            (iii) A substantial increase in first-line Fleet                    Air Arm aircraft in the course of the                    next few years             (iv) Five cruisers in the 1936 programme,,              (v) Steady replacement programme for destroyers                    and submarines.             (vi ) lAoderni sat ion of certain battleships.            (vii) Make good existing deficiencies in                    ammunition and stores.AiySL1          (i) Four new infantry battalions,             (ii) Equipment of existing formations with modern                    araiament with adequate reserves.-.Coast Defences *        Modernisation at home and abroad at an                    accelerated rate.
Air Forces    First-line metropolitan strength up to                approximately 1750 aircraft exclusive of                Fleet Air Ann,  Nc elate was given for the                completion of this programme.  The increase                of the Force at home to a total of 123                squadrons with approximately 1500 aircraft                had &quot;been approved by the House of Commons                earlier in the financial year 1935-6.         In the eleven months that have passed since theWhite Paper was issued,, a great deal of the work has been of a preparatory nature such as the creation of capacityby arranging extensions on terms settled with the Treasuryof a number of large undertakings.   It was seen from the outset, for instance, that gun mountings and time fuseswould cause d.elays and special attention has been given tothe facilities for their production.  Large extensionsare being iiia.de for various&apos;items by firms such as VickersArmstrong;  Imperial Chemical Industries;  Beardmores;Firth-Brown;  English Steel Corporation;  Ferranti;Harland &amp; Wolff,   Recently approval has been given forthe acquisition of Scotswood, a well-equipped and very extensive engineering establishment adjoining Elswick onthe Tyne, and for ordering  500,000 worth of machine-toolsto complete the plant required.   These tools will not beprovided in less than a year;  there are also certainlocomotive contracts occupying part of Scotswood whichwill take nine months to finish.   Scotswood will bechiefly used for army requirements, such as guns, gun mountings, tanks,  fuzes.   3,000&apos;men are working therenow and more than double this number will be employedwhen the equipment Is complete.   It is a most valuableaddition to existing capacity.         The Navy Programme has naturally proceeded moresmoothly than in the cases of the other two Services.The Dockyards and the professional  shipbuilding firms havebeen quickly set working on the programme,  and generallyspeaking, new construction,  modernisation,  and provision of
.armament stores, are all satisfactory and. well up to date.Contracts for two new Capital Ships were, in fact, placed at the end of July  and construction has now begun.Acceleration of the building now in hand to the extent of six months earlier  completion was arranged, but chieflyowing to gun mounting delays, the acceleration will notexceed three months.         It has further been found possible to accelerate the Naval building programme by the addition in 1936 of1 aircraft carrier, 2 cruisers, 1 flotilla of destroyers,and four submarines.  A similarly augmented programme hasbeen proposed for 1937.         Plans have been forms.de to complete the re-equipmentwith modern anti-aircraft  armament of the more importantunits in three years.         An extensive and  important programme forequipping older units (cruisers and below) with modernA. A. armament so that they can efficiently protect our shipping remains to be arranged for.  With, the present rate of gun construction it will, however, be impracticable to complete this programme for some years and the A. A.re-armament of the  main Fleet may have to be delayed, inconsequence.         It has been clecided to lay up a total reserve of oil fuel for the Navy in Admiralty and Dominiondepots of 7,000,000 tons;  4,550,000 tons are already in store and in addition, a purchase of 500,000 tons is being carried out by regulai shipments which began in November, 1936,  and will be completed.by31st March, 1937.
        The Army requirements are formidable,  owing tothe fact that in most cases it has been necessary to equipnon-armament firms for this work.   Further, great delay in placing orders is being caused in some cases by the dif-ficulty in completion of design particularly in connectionwith tanks and gun carriages.   The new- Bren gun will begin to be turned out at Enfield in September.   Some 400 shouldbe delivered by 1st January 1938, after which output will rise to a maximum of 200 a week by about July 1938.   Atleast 10,000 are required for the Regular Army.   Capacityhas been allocated for guns for the Regular Army and production is proceeding.   Deliveries of the quantitiesrequired of the several types will be spread over the years1937 to 1939.   This does not include the new as distinct from the converted 25-pounder field gun which will not beready for production until 1938.    A new gun factory atNottingham has begun production this month.    Its equipment and all the organisation necessary have been carried outwith great energy and success.   Capacity exists for allthe requirements in the approved Programme of the RegularArmy.   The Tank position is bad. and except for lighttanks, delivery of which is now being made, no tanks have been ordered pending settlement of design.   Arrangements, however,have been made for Lord Nuffield to make plans for buildingthe cruiser tanks, the final design of which is nearing completion:  they will be turned out at the rate of three to four a week from about the end of this year.        The foregoing details are only selected from a longlist of requirements, but I believe they given an accurategeneral impression of the whole.   The programme is undoubtedly
behindhand in many important respects,  but it is behindhandjust in those matters which no compulsory powers would affect, such as guns, tanks and technical instruments likepredictors.        It is possible to obtain some impression as to the stage which has at present been reached in the completionof the equipment of the Field Force by statement of what theposition will be in May of this year.   The maximum force which could be mobilized for service overseas would be two divisions together with ancillary troops.   These divisionscould only be mobilized at the expense of the other regularformations in the United Kingdom.   One light tank battalionwould be ready and the first-line transport would be follymechanised&apos;.   The force would be deficient in Infantry tanks100%, mortars 25$, Bren guns 100$, anti-tank rifles 75$,anti-tank 2-pdr. guns 80$.   Field artillery ammunition(18,-pdr. and 4.5 How.) will be available for ninet^r days&apos;operations.   Ammunition components for a further ninetydays are now in store.   The mobile division, composed oftwo mechanised cavalry brigades, will not have been formed.One of the brigades will be in process of re-organisationand unfit for service;   the other brigade will not have started mechanisation.        The completion of Anti-Aircraft schemes for thedefence of Great Britain awaits the production of the 3.7&quot;and 4.5&quot; guns, technical instruments and searchlights.   Ofthe latter 2,302 in all including reserves are needed.Deliveries are now at the rate of sixteen a week and by may 1937 about 700 will be available including presentstocks and new deliveries.   Of the 3.7&quot; guns,  of which340 were originally approved, deliveries will begin from
 woolwich and Nottingham next autumn and will he completed by April 1939.   The 4.5&quot; guns will not all be delivered until the end of 1939.   Orders have been placed for the whole of the 300 originally approved.   A further 200 have since been sanctioned and capacity for them has been allotted.   Capacity for certain instruments is deficient and there will be dif- ficulty in keeping pace with gun production in this respect. There are now available with regular units 14 two-gun sections of 3&quot; guns and with Territorial units 58 such sections. These sections are complete with instruments, ammunition and all ancillary stores.   By May 1st there will be 24 such sections with regular units and. 80 with Territorial units complete in all respects.   The regular units are, however, part of the Field Force and cannot be regarded as available for home defence in all contingencies.        Subject to the ordinary delays which are inevitable for one reason or another, the coast Defences are being carried out as proposed.        The Air Force programme has been more than once augmented.   On the personnel side which has involved an enormous expansion, both recruiting and training have proceeded very satisfactorily.   The aerodrome and station programme has made very good progress but serious difficulties are now being encountered by reason of the shortage of building labour. On the material side, generally speaking, deliveries,  by the professional firms, of engines are good, but of airframes indifferent.   The latter is mainly due to optimistic forecasts by firms as to the dates at which production of new types would begin.        In order to afford some basis for estimating what is being done, in the period 1930-34 the average numbers of airframes and engines ordered annually were  680 and 750
respectively.   In order to carry out the programme,  timedfor completion by April of this year, over 4,000 air framesand 4,700 engines were required in the financial years1035 and 1936.   These figures of course include provisionfor all requirements at home and overseas including training,replacements and reserves.   Actually in the last twocalendar years approximately 3,000 airframes and 5,000engines have been received, figures for the last threemonths being 4-87 and 762 respectively.   This rate of delivery will be substantially increased as the programmeproceeds.   The shortage of completed aircraft chieflyrelates to. bombers;  in fighters the numbers are satisfactory.        It will be realised that the shadow factory scheme has no bearing upon these figures, as none of the shadowfirms have yet come into production.   AS to these theAustin Company&apos;s factory for air frames is in an advanced stage.   The tiling and glazing of the roof has begun.The proposed kootes factory at White Waltham is not to be erected and a site is to be looked for in Lancashire.The Daimler factory for engines is nearlag completion and.work has begun on fitting up the offices.   The Standardfactory is even further advanced and, the office block isnow ready for occupation.   The Hover and Humber factories are at the stage of the erection of the steel work.   the bristol Company&apos;&apos;s engine assembly factory is now actuallybeginning erection.   The erection of new factories in belfast (Short-Harland Wolff) and at Dumbarton (Blackburn-Denny) is proceeding satisfactorily.        Deliveries of winches and balloons for the balloonbarrage for London have begun.
        Generally speaking the airframe programme lias up tothe present &quot;been disappointing.   The difficulties have beenimmense and the aircraft firms have not kept their promisesas to deliveries.   It is certain that no acceleration could have been or even now is possible except by taking skilledfitters out of engineering works and placing them in existingaircraft factories and working in double shifts.   For thispurpose compulsory powers would be necessary.  - The programmealso includes a vast amount of armament and equipment ofdifferent kinds.   The position of this is reasonably satisfactory.        There is one part of the Defence plans which isbeing most successfully and quietly carried out.   plans have not only been made but contracts have been entered into and deliveries already begun in some cases of the manycommodities necessary for the construction of armaments,such as aluminium, magnesium, vanadium and several othercomparatively scarce commodities.   Fortunately no questionshave been asked about these in parliament and contracts forthe necessary quantities to create reserves for three to twelvemonths have been placed without any rise in prices.        The machine tool industry is now increasinglyworking to produce for the Government programme.   Such a concentration necessitates a -postponement of deliveries toother customers.   Generally speaking the machine toolposition is better than I thought six months ago would bepossible, and substantially the whole &quot;of the originalrequirements for the Government programme will be completed by the end of this year.   This, however, does not includethe demands that will be made consequent upon the acquisition
of scotswood, chiefly,  as already stated,  for the  Army-and other extensions -recently approved.    Some little time ago an understanding was arrived at with the machine tooltrade that if they were not able to make deliveries withina reasonable time facilities should be used for getting thenecessary tools from foreign suppliers.    Advantage hasbeen taken of this arrangement and the Air Ministry inparticular have lately made a most satisfactory acquisitionof up-to-date and powerful machines.        I am discussing with the machine tool representativesthe plans for equipping Scotswood.   I think it is probablethat a considerable part of what is wanted can be, and oughtto be, obtained from abroad.        Labour shortage has naturally required and islikely in the future to require close attention.        The trend of development of the labour situation may be illustrated as follows by reference to some of thetrades mainly concerned with the Government Programme.   in engineering the number unemployed or temporarily stopped atthe middle of December was 57,930 (6.1$),  a reduction ofover 25,000 on the March figures, in shipbuilding thenumber was 43,380 (27.2%), a reduction of over 11,000 onthe March figures;  in iron and steel the number was 22,570(.12..4$), a reduction of about 9,400 on the March figures.        The figures of unemployed unfortunately are noindex to the amount of skilled labour still available forabsorption on the Government Programme as they include alarge proportion of unskilled and semi-skilled men, togetherwith considerable numbers of skilled men,  no longer capableof resuming their trade or requiring long reconditioning and                           -10-
training for the purpose.   The amount of available skilled labour is becoming very short,  especially in engineering.the end of November the number of wholly -unemployed menregistered in the skilled engineering occupations was 8341of whom only 4,047were regarded as suitable for immediateemployment.       -  -        I am discussing the whole labour situation in that industry shortly with the Service Ministers and the Ministeof Labour.        The situation in the building industry is alsodifficult.   I have dealt with this by obtaining an estimateprogramme of the total demands on the industry in the next three years and am conferring with all Ministers concernedwith a view to discussion of the position with the industryand the devising of remedial measures in consultation withthem.
