&quot;wggJDOCTMBRT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRTTAhTaO. Iv&amp;JESTYAS GOVERNMENT.       l8l1.   It is necessary to direct attention to the Annual Holiday Bill,introduced by Mr. Rowson, which received a second reading on 27th November.I understand that the Trade Union Congress General Council have decided toask that the Bill may be made a Government Bill and they propose to seek ameeting with the Prime Minister in order to make this request.   In anycase, it is expected that the Bill will be before a Standing Committee inthe near future.2o   Legislation of this kind covering both manual workers and salariedemployees has been passed in 16 countries, B.nd the most recent legislation,that in France, has attracted considerable public attention.   this legislation, like the Bill under consideration usually -provides for holidaysonly for employees who have had at least twelve months&apos; continuous service.The Draft Convention adopted at the last International labour Conference isalso on this basis.3.   At this Conference the British Government referred to the fact thatprovisions confined to workpeople who have had a year&apos;s continuous service with one undertaking leave out of account the very large proportion of work-people, who have broken employment or who work for different employers duringthe year.   It was indicated that the real problem was that of providingfor holidays with pay for such workpeople, who probably constitute the greatmajority, and it was proposed, therefore, on behalf of the Government, thatthe Conference should decide, in favour of a Recommendation and so stimulateconsideration of that aspect of the problem which constitutes the substantial difficulty in the provision of holidays with pay for manual workers.4.   The present &apos; Bill provides that employment for different employers inthe same industry shall be regarded as continuous employment (withoutindicating which employer is to bear the cost&apos; of the holiday) but,  even so,it is bound to be disappointing when its narrow field is realised,  and cabinet.Copy No.  M-lMemorandum by the Minister of labour.
                                                                .182further action will he expected.    The Trades Union Congress  General council which desires to establish by law the  principle  of non-contributory holidaysrealises the importance of this first  step.   On the  other hand it is clearthat wages and payment for holidays form part of the  total remuneration  of the worker and that (a) any compulsory enforcement of holidays will be likely to lead to wages adjustments and (b) a financial pool to provide a holiday  fund to which various employers will have to contribute will be required underthe present Bill.5.   Public opinion, supported by opinion in the House,  will  be in favour of passing the present Bill but it is desirable that the whole subject should beconsidered by a committee on which employers and workpeople are represented.In the meantime it will be expected that the Government will  be prepared toassume some responsibility for amending the  present Bill in order to make its operation practicable.  It has obviously been drafted with little regard tothe circumstances, and substantial amendment will be  required.   Thefollowing are some points which arise -     (a) As the holiday is due only after a  year&apos;s service it is not due to         be given, as the Bill provides, in  the  year.   The obligation,         which is the subject of -penalty, may, therefore, fall upon a new         employer who will, therefore, be reluctant to give employment  to the         worker concerned.   The Bill seems  to be drafted on  the basis  of         -permanent employment.     (b) &quot;In the same employment&quot; under Clause 9 (2)  means employment in         any capacity in the same industry carried on by persons in         succession.   Difficult questions will  arise as to what is the         &quot;same employment&quot;.   For example, will  a fitter in a Railway Shop         be in the same employment (i.e., &quot;in the same trade  or business&quot;         under Clause 9 (2)) if he works later in a motor or  aircraft         establishment?  It would appear that some authority  would, have  to         be established to settle such questions.     (c) Under Clause 1 (2) the expression &quot;year&quot; means a term of twely e         months calculated in the -prescribed manner.    As there is usually         a break between different employments and there are  often         recognised breaks in employment even with the same employer at         different periods of the year it will not be easy to settle the                                     2.
    manner of calculation to cover the circumstances of different    industries.    It nay be expected  that, with this new obligation,    there will be  a tendency to  create circumstances which will    increase casual employment and impede re-employment *   In the case    of workers normally regularly employed breaks can be made to    relieve their  employers of the holiday obligation.(d)  Clause 2 provides  that full  wages shall be paid during the holiday    loeriod subject to  the deduction of any sums earned in other    employment during  the holidays    While the object of -this provision    may be right,  it seems to  be wrong to credit such earnings to the    employer.   It would also  be difficult to discover whether other    work was done  and  it is doubtful  whether the freedom of a worker    to act as he pleases during  his holiday can be so restricted.    He may, for  example, have  a  spare time occupation which is    remunerative.   Compulsory inactivity must always be difficult to    enforces(e)  Clause S provides  for the  calculation, of wages of workers paid    -partly by time and by the  -piece in a manner to be prescribed.  Any    disputes are to be referred  for a binding decision to the registrar    of the county court.   It  would axrpear that registrars will  thus be    given an onerous task and  one for which they are not necessarily well    suitedo  The calculation of  wages has  so many complexities that    special -tribunals  would probably  be  necessary.(f)  Clause 7 &quot;provides  that the holiday shall be in addition to other    holidays to  which, the employed person would have been entitled by    law or custom.  Apparently  Bank  Holidays are in mind but in    different parts  of the country  there are customary holidays  such as    the Wakes in Lancashire, Bowlingti&amp;e in Yorkshire, Glasgow Fair    Week etc., for which wages are not paid but for which the work-    people have  always made financial provision by savings funds, etc.    In these cases it  would appear that  payment for &quot;the existing    holiday periods  and not -provision for further stoppage of production    would be desired.   Provision for payment for such holidays  would,    of course, be equivalent to  a compulsory increase of wages.
     (g) It -will be necessary to define &quot;eight clear consecutive days&quot;         which may or may not include Sundayss   Perhaps the intention is         to include two Sundays, at the beginning and end. of the holiday         respectively;  but obviously if the holiday begins, say, on          Tuesday, seven week-days would, have to be included in the total of         eight end this would, be more than a &quot;week&quot;.3,   Although some of the collective agreements which regulate labour conditions in this country provide for paid holidays, the majority do not and. -this majority includes the most important and most hard-pressed industries such as coalmining, shipbuilding, and cotton.  Before the debate, theNational Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations represented strongly tome that the Bill would impose a burden on certain industries which theycannot afford, if wages are not to be reduced and that the proper way of proceeding is by voluntary agreement and not by legislative compulsion.  Theyhold that as vrages, hours and all other incidents in the contract of employ-ment depend in the last resort on the proceeds of industry, State inter-vention to compel employers to give paid holidays will react on wages and hours,  which are still left to be settled by voluntary agreement.  Whateverweight should, be attached to this argument, it is necesEsaxy to face the factthat the &quot;passage of the Bill may have a disturbing effect on existingcollective agreements.7/,   In my opinion, the discussions on the present Bill will not enable theproblems to be defined or examined in the way their importance requires.This examination can only be carried out satisfactorily by a Committee onwhich employers and workpeople are represented and before which publicevidence can be given by industrial organisations and other interested parties.   Subject to any views which my colleagues may have I would proposeto approach the National Confederation of Emploj^ers1 Organisations and theTrade Union Congress General Council with a view to securing their co-operation in an inquiry by a Departnental Committee.  The appointment ofsuch a Committee vrould not prevent Mr. Rowson&apos;s Bill from being proceeded within Standing Committee but it would be an important element in the considera-tion of the Bill by the House.  It seems to me to be essential to have such
an examination of the subject made before deciding our attitude to theBill.   Further, the proposal to appoint a ComrdLttee would, provide a reply to the request which has just been made in a letter from theTrade Union Congress General Council to the Prime Minister, that theGovernment should give facilities for the Bill to be considered by a standing Committee of the House of Commons.
