In the ahsenee of the President of the Board  of  TradeI circulate to my colleagues the attached memorandum  bythe Secretary for Mines regarding the Coal Mines (Employmentof Boys) Bill.                                           K.W.Ministry of Health,      22nd January, 1937.
            COAL MINERS (EMPLOYMENT OF BOYS&quot;) BILL.            Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.     The above Private Member&apos;s Bill, introduced byMr. Charles Taylor, M.P., obtained its Second Reading withouta division on the 20th November last.  Mr; William Whiteley,M.P., who, in the absence of Mr. Taylor, moved the SecondReading, the opportunity for which occurred quiteunexpectedly, stated that the Bill was an agreed measure,&amp;nd that &quot;the Mines Department is anxious that it should secure a Second Reading and go upstairs to Standing Committee     I need hardly say that this statement by Mr. Whiteleywas entirely unauthorised and inaccurate.   The Bill was included in the list of Private Members&apos; Bills on theCabinet agenda on two occasions (CP.64(35)15 andC.P.66(36)13), but was not dealt with, as it had not then been printed.                    Object of the 3111.     The Bill, a copy of which is attached, has only oneoperative clause, which makes it illegal for boys (i.e. as defined in the Coal Mines Act, 1911, males under 16) to be .employed* below-ground in coal mines at night (i.e. between10 p.m. and 5 a.m.)     In the present state of the lav; the employment of &quot;boysin and about mines at night (other than underground) is governed by Section 92 of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, by theEmployment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, 1920,and Section 26 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.  Theeffect of these Acts is that a boy under 16 must not beemployed above ground at night.  &quot;Night&quot; means a period of atleast 12 hoursj which must include the following periods:*Boys actually so employed, at the date of the passing of    the Bill will not be affected.
   Goal Mines - Surface - 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. (Coal Mines Act                                           1911, Section 92%   Metalliferous Mines and Quarries - Surface - 8 p.m. to                                 6 a.m. (Factory Act, 1901,                                         Section 26),   Metalliferous Mines and Quarries - Underground - 10 pan.,                                 to 5 a.m. (Women and Young                                            Persons Act,1930).     There is, however, no such prohibition in the case of boys* employed underground at coal mines, who may work at night if an interval, ordinarily of 15 hours and in no caseof less than 13 hours, separates two periods of work.  Thisexception means, in practice, that boys may be employed onthe night shift underground at coal mines though they maynot be so employed at other mines, nor on the. surface, norat quarries.  Prominence has recently been given to this anomaly by the prosecution of the Rossett. Sand and GravelCompany, Limited, who were convicted at Wrexham Police Courton 15th September, 1936, of employing boys under 18 at nightat Pant Wood Quarry.   Mr, Cyril Jones, defending theCompany, pointed out that a boy could work belowground atcoal mines on a night shift at the age of 14- and that therewere thousands of boys only 14 years of age working below-ground at night, and he called attention to what he described as &quot;the absurdity of the law&quot;.            Attitude of the Industry to the Bill.     There is a great deal to be said for removing this anomaly, and very little to be said against it.  I have consulted both the Mining Association and the Minewo-rkers&apos;Federation about the Bill.  The latter are strongly infavour of it.  The former opposed a suggestion for legislation on these lines which was put forward in 1932, for a number of reasons, which their representatives1 again put forward when Imet them some weeks ago in connection with the present Bill **^cTion&quot;&apos;91 of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, prohibits the  employment underground at all of boys under 14*                       -2-
KM         Since then,  however, I have learned that the Association    have decided,  in all the circornstances,  not to press their    opposition to  the Bill - realising,  as I think they now do,    that its principle is one which is likely to he acceptable to -    all parties in  the House.  Also, they realise that since    there are only 3-4,000 boys employed on the night shift, the    Bill cannot be regarded as likely to constitute a very    onerous burden  upon the industry.         Moreover, a shortage of boys available for employment    in coal mines  is showing Itself, and may become serious in    the near future.   In that event, coalowners ?/ill be obliged    to a corresponding extent to replace boys by adult labour.  If    this occurs, they can employ the adults on the night shift,    transfer boys  from the night shift to the day shift, and so    meet the conditions of the draft bill with little, if any,    additional expense.                             conclusion.         In all the circumstances,  therefore, I am satisfied    that the Bill  is one to which the Government can properly    give their support, and. I suggest that I might be authorised    to make an announcement to that effect when the Bill is    considered in  Committee.                                              H.C.21st January, 1937.
