(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS  GOVERNMENT.)C RET.                    0 A B I N g T.                 RESERVE FORGES BILL.       kfcmoran&amp;urr: by ;the Secretary  of  State for. War. 1.      Ill accordance  with the  decision of  the  Cabinet  at their Meeting on 9th  December,  1936  (Cabinet  73  (35),Conclusion 9;  Cop,319 (36)), I  attach a draft  of  the Reserve Forces Bill,  1937. 2.      Owing to the state of Parliamentary business? the Whips are pressing for the Bill to be introduced  at  an early date.    Accordingly,  since no  meeting of the  Home Affairs Committee has  been fixed for the near future,  I am circulating the draft Bill direct to  the Cabinet. 3.      Section A of the Army Reserve  is formed under the Reserve Forces and Militia Act,  1898,  as amended  by  the Territorial and Reserve Forces  Act,  1907.   It consists of men who agree  to be liable, during the first  two  years of their Reserve  Service,  to be recalled to the  colours  &quot;when they are required for service  outside the  United  Kingdom when warlike operations are in preparation or in progress&quot;,  in circumstances, however,  in which it  has not been  judged necessary to call up  the Reserve as  a whole by proclamation. 4..     Of recent years the number of  men who,  on  or shortly after  passing from the  colours to  the  Reserve,  have volunteered to undertake the special  Section  A liability, has been insufficient to  maintain  the strength of  Section  A at the required level.    Indeed,  the whole of the infantry reservists in Section A had to  be recalled to  the colours to provide the compariti ely small emergency  force sent to Palestine. 5.      The attached bill carries out  the decision of the Cabinet that the Reserve Forces and  Militia Act,  1898,  as amended by the Territorial and Reserve Forces  Act, 1907, should again be amended to provide that the liability  of a man enrolling in Section A to  be called out shall extend not to  the first two years&quot; of his  Reserve service, as at present, but to the first five years, with the proviso  that such. liability shall not extend beyond the term of  the man&apos;s normal engagement of  twelve years (Colour  and Reserve  service taken together).   This will have the effect  both of widen- ing the field of recruitment and of  lengthening the  period of  time during which  men enrolled in Section  A can continue to  serve therein. 6.      I ask the Cabinet to aoorove  the draft  Bill with a view to its introduction at a  very early date.D.G.COPY NO.The War Office,29 th January, 19 37.
