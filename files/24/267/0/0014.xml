NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE DISPENSING,              Memorandum by  the Minister  of  Health.          1.    The  passing of the National Health  Insurance Act,     1936,  a  purely consolidating Act, has brought to  light a     serious  difficulty connected with the right of  limited     companies and  co-operative societies to contract  with     Insurance Committees  for the dispensing of medicines under     the National Health Insurance  schemec          2.    The  point at  issue is  a highly technical one and     I  need not trouble my colleagues with the whole of the     details,  but broadly speaking  the position is as  follows        (a)     Since the inception  of National Health  Insurance          it  has never been  doubted that  corporate bodies          (including limited companies and co-operative societies)          could take part  in the dispensing  service as being         persons entitled to carry on the business of a chemist          or  druggist  under  the Pharmacy Acts;  and in fact a         very considerable  part of the National Health Insurance          dispensing services has been provided by these bodies.        (b)     The  Pharmacy  and Poisons Act, 1933, made a number          of  alterations of  nomenclature, and references to the          right to  carry on  business as a chemist or druggist          disappeared  and  were replaced partly by provisions         which make persons  &quot;authorised sellers of poisons&quot;  and         partly by provisions dealing with  the titles or         descriptions  which pharmacists may use.    As aSJSJSi; R B T.G.P.13(37) .
     consequence it became difficult in drafting the     consolidating Bill of last session to determine what     was the effect of the Act- of 1933 on the previous     National Health Insurance law, but after consideration     the Joint Consolidation Committee, for reasons which     need not be set out here, came to the conclusion that     the persons entitled to dispense under the National     Health Insurance system are not those who are &quot;authorised     sellers of poisons&quot; but those who are entitled to use     the title of &quot;chemist and. druggist&quot; 0          This decision;; which was accepted by Parliament     without any appreciation of its consequences, has led     to a most unfortunate result0   In the first place,     it debars from National Health Insurance dispensing     any corporate body which is not able or willing to     appoint its superintendent pharmacists on the board     of management, and this rules out all co-operative     societies, since they are forbidden by their rules to     have employees on the Board0   Secondly,, it is by no     means certain that any corporate body is entitled to     use the &quot;title&quot; (as distinct from the &quot;description&quot;)     of chemist and druggist and. if so, limited companies     as well as co-operative societies would be debarred     from the service a     So   For the reasons indicated there can be no doubtthat an unwitting change In the law has been effected whichseriously prejudices the position of co-operative societies and possibly of corporate bodies cf all kinds in the matterof National Health Insurance dispensing.   My attention hasbeen drawn to the point by the Rtc hon A0V,  Alexander, map,on behalf of the co-operative societies, and there is nodoubt that unless correcting legislation is introduced thematter will be taken up in Parliament on behalf of these
societies.   I should,  however,  propose that any amending bill should be put forward on the broader ground thatdoubt has been cast on the position of corporate bodiesas a whole.     4.   I am advised that the  necessary legislation  a would be of the shortest description and would in substance merely substitute the  words &quot;persons who areregistered pharmacists or authorised sellers of poisonswithin the meaning of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act,  1933&quot;for the words &quot;persons who are entitled under the Pharmacyand Poisons Acts,  1852 to 1953,  to use the title * chemistand druggist&apos;&quot;.   The Bill might appropriately beintroduced into the House of Lords,          I should be glad to receive the authority ofthe Cabinet for the early preparation and introductionof a short Bill on these lines,    I may add that theposition described in this paper obtains in Scotland no less than in England and that the Secretary of Statefor Scotland concurs in these proposals,                                       K. W.                                  January 15th,  1937.
