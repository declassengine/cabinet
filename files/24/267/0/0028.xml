THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT                                                                        154    ;:-::!!  &apos;?0i &quot;u,  Printed[&apos;for.the,Cabinet.

Copy No. 4 gC.P,i&apos;27&apos;j[37).:  &apos;.  ,  ;&quot;  /&apos;   -   &apos;     .         &apos;  ..        &apos;    &apos; ^  .  ,*CABINET.PLEDGES GIVEN AS  REGARDS  PARITY  WITH THE GERMAN AIR                                 EORCE.              Memorandum  by  the Secretary of State for Air.    THE following are the principal relevant statements made in the House ofCommons in regard to parity  with the German Air Force :     (1)  The Lord  President  of the Council (Mr. Baldwin) on the  8th March,\m^-(Hansard, col. 2078)         &apos;&apos; In conclusion, I say that if all our efforts fail, and if it is  not possible    to obtain this equality in such matters as I have indicated, then .  . . .  this    Government will see to it that in air strength and air power this country    shall no longer be  in a  position  inferior to any  country within striking... . distance of our shores.&quot;    (2). T\he Lord President of the Council (Mr. Baldwin) on the 28th. November,1934-[Hansard, col. 883) :-    .                                      ;         &quot; All that I would  say is this,  that His Majesty&apos;s Government are    determined in no conditions to accept any position of inferiority  with regard    to what air force may be raised in Germany in the future.&apos;&apos;         Earl  Winterton:  &quot;When my Rt. Hon. Friend spoke of Europe,- did    he include the  Mediterranean ?  &quot;         Mr. Baldwin:  &quot; The Mediterranean, I think, is generally recognised as    part of Europe, but .  . . .&quot;         Earl Winterton: &quot; Not merely for home defence? &quot;      :         Mr. Baldwin.-  &quot; I referred to machines available for home defence which    are stationed in  the United kingdom .&apos;&apos;    (3)  The Lord President of the Council (Mr. Baldwin)  on the 22nd May, 1935(Hansard, cols. 367 and 368) :          &quot;In the course of those conversations Herr Hitler made it clear that his    goal was parity with Frauce.   Now we  are basing  our estimates on that   ;: strength.  It is always difficult to know what parity  is, or from what angle    it is envisaged. We have to make a certain amount of guess-work there, and    for our purpose, for the parity of the three nations, we have taken a figure    round about 1,500 first-line aircraft.....That is  the figure at which we    are aiming, and to which  we  intend to proceed with all the speed we can.&quot;    I ought to add  an extract  from  my own speech on the 22nd July, 1935(Hansard, cols. 1562 and 1563), introducing the Air Supplementary Estimate :          &quot; The basis on which the programme rests is the German Government&apos;s    statement of their intention...to.ha.ve._an Air-Force,equal to that of France.  It    is stated in terms of first-line strength. ....      [14471]
         &quot;I ought also to add that in computing the figure of 1,500 first-line    strength we are excluding the squadrons serving overseas .  . .  . and we are    also excluding the  Fleet  Air Arm,  which  at present  has 171  first-line    machines.   For both the overseas squadrons and  the  Fleet  Air  Arm,  at;   continuing provision is made in the present Estimates, and will,  df io(i)U^se;    be made in future Estimates.  But both the overseas squadrons andThe&quot;Freet    Air Arm are excluded entirely from this programme of home de^nee^. which;    as  I have said, we have put at the present day  at a first-line &quot;strength&apos; of    1,500.  We have taken that on consideration as being the fair figure on which    to work with all the information at our disposal.&quot;    I should, perhaps, also refer to a statement made by Mr. Churchill in the debate on the 12th November, 1936 (Hansard, col. 1115), as this statement wascategorical and was not questioned in the subsequent debate :          &quot; We were promised most solemnly by the  Government that air parity : .  with Germany would be maintained by the home defence-forces.&apos;&apos; - - i - -&quot; i I  .1    From the quotations given above, I think it is clear that in assessing whetheror not we are inferior to Germany, we have committed ourselves quite definatly to taking as a standard of comparison the German Air Force and our MetropolitanAir Force.  Any  other  standard would,  in fact,  be a change  of  the policy announced, and could  not be justified as a fair interpretation of it.    I think, therefore, that this  definitely  excludes us from taking into accountsquadrons overseas.  There is, however, a point in relation to the Fleet Air-armwhich deserves  consideration.   In determining a figure  of first-Hue strength of1,500, we undoubtedly took that figure as the estimate  of the total German first-line strength, and we  excluded the whole of the Fleet Air Arm.  On merits, I donot feel that this is reasonable, and as stated in my recent Cabinet paper,* I thinkit would be reasonable-to take some account at any rate of that portion of theFleet Air Arm which is  normally stationed in home waters, as against  german aircraft designed and ear-marked for co-operation with the German Fleet.-    I  submit  that there are  really two  considerations  to  which  we  should conform :     (1) We must act in accordance with the pledges given by the Prime Minister.    (2)  We should avoid being  bound by  literal  tests of  numerical parity.           I believe them to be wholly unreal.    I would suggest,  therefore, that our interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;spledge should be to this effect :-                                    \    We are determined  that we  will not be  inferior in  air strength at  home toany Country within striking distance of our shores.  This implies-  :     (i) That we should  build and maintain a defensive force adequate to meet:1        -.. any anticipated scale of attack;                 v.-     -    (ii) That we should build and maintain a counter-offensive force not inferior           in power and efficiency to the  offensive  force of  a foreign  Power/      .     German offensive force.    The Government, on the  advice  of the  Air Staff, must  be responsible for deciding the numbers and types of an aircraft which  will most  satisfactorilyachieve that dual purpose.                                  ;    &apos;  ;  &apos;     1          &apos;  &apos;      .&apos;                                  - &apos;   &apos;,,     &apos;   &apos; S.    Air Ministry;: &apos;                               -      ** -*  &apos;  &quot;,-       -  January 22.  1937.            &apos;          &apos;     &apos;   &apos;*&apos;: CP: 18 (37).
