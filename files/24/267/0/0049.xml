IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .S E C RET.n.P. 48 (37).COPY NO.if/&quot;IA BIN E T.MINISTERS&apos;SALARIES.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.     Annexed is an outline prepared by the Parliamentarydraughtsmanj in consultation with myself, which will show how we would propose to carry out the recommendations ofthe Committee on Ministerial Salaries.     The Cabinet will observe in Clause 4(2), the method bywhich it is proposed to identify &quot;Cabinet Ministers&quot; - thesepersonages being hitherto entirely unknown to the law.   The&quot;Prime Minister&quot; is also, formally speaking, a constitutionalnovelty, but I think he does not need definition.   It seemsto me that instead of allotting to him the proposed salary of 10,000 &quot;as prime Minister&quot;, it would be better to includethe First Lord of the Treasury in the schedule as a  5,000office and then to provide that there should be paid to thePrime Minister a salary of  5,000 in addition to the salaryattached to his Cabinet Office0(Intld.)  j.s.
