SPIDENTIAL.A.G. 359.BOARD -OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER, 1956.Summary of reports submitted by members of the  Boardof Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some caseswith statistical information from other sources).      OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in December at  83.7 m.  were  9.2  m.  more  than in December, 1935.   Nearly two-thirds of  the rise was  in food and raw materials.   Of the increase of  3.2  m.  in manufactured goods,  841,000 related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures,-  530,000 to  machinery, and  411,000 to  oils, fats  and resins.   Exports of  United Kingdom products,  40.5 m.,  were  5.6 m.  more and re-exports,   6.1 m.,  were&quot; 658,000 more than in December, 1935.      EMPLOYMENT.    The  total number of unemployed persons on  the registers at 14th December - 1,628,719 - was 5,117 more  than  at  23rd November.  The main variations were;-London......South Eastern. . .South Western...Midlands........North Eastern.. .-4,569  Northwestern... -4,7834.1,937  Northern........ 42,743-  105  Scotland........ 4*6,1674-6,540  &quot;Wales........... -3,9714-1,058The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,132,000 -12,000 more than at 23rd November and 50 3,000 more than at16th December, 1935.     Employment improved (as compared with November) inthe coal mining, iron and steel, motor vehicle and aircraft,shipbuilding etc, cotton and tailoring industries, the distributive trades and the hotel etc. service;  but itdeclined in the pottery, boot and shoe and hosiery industries                        -1-
and in a number of industries (including building andcontracting) in which outdoor employment on 14th december was interrupted by adverse weather conditions.     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.   In the four weeks ended 27th Decemberrailway traffic receipts increased by  674,000 (5.82%)compared with the corresponding period of 1935.  passenger traffic increased by 4.98%, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 10.26% and coal, coke and patent fuel by1.08%.  Total receipts for the fifty-two weeks ended27th December increased by  5.06 m. (3.34%) compared withthe corresponding  period of 1935.     SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.    All freight marketsdisplayed a firm tone.  The Chamber of Shipping index numberof freights (1913 s 100) was 135.51 as against 111.41 inNovember and 96.11 a year ago.  At 1st January 212,000 nettons of shipping were laid up in Great Britain and ireland as compared with 403,000 at 1st October and 436,000 at1st January, 1935.   The shortage of sea-going engineers and able seamen became acute.     A long period&quot;of shipbuilding activity is in prospect.The amount of tonnage under construction in Great Britainand Ireland at 31st December was 964,000 tons gross (thehighest quarterly total since September, 1930) as against929,000 at 30th September and 743,000 at the end of 1935.     BANKING.    Money was in good demand throughoutDecember,  with conditions at times approaching stringency.The note circulation reached a new high point ( 474 m.)just before Christmas.  The Treasury Bill rate rose from11s.  5.29d.  to 20s.  7.41d.  (the highest for three years), .but relapsed to 12s. 11.77d. in the last week.  The exchange equalisation Fund sold  65 m. of gold to the Bank ofEngland:  at the same time the fiduciary issue was reduced                       -2-
 by  60 m.    The  price of gold  moved between 141s.  4d.  and 142s.  Id.  and  the price of  silver from 2u d.  to 2lfd.   Foreign exchanges  were remarkably steady-   The spot franc  remained at 105    &quot; l05vf  throughout  December,  but the three  months forward rate varied between if and 2-g- francs discount.   The dollar was steady between 4.89f and 4.92.     FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROADV   Apart  from Germany and to some extent France financial conditions  have shown considerable improvement generally.   In  France the results of devaluation have been  disappointing.  Dear money continued and the  gold outflow persisted.   The rise in prices and costs,  due  mainly to  social  legislation,  has  virtually neutralised the benefit which  might have  been expected to  result from devaluation.   In Germany,   despite an increased volume of exports and a  larger export surplus, free foreign exchange receipts appear  to  have declined.   The rationing system for certain imported foods has  been extended.   In  Holland and Switzerland progress since devaluation has been unmistakeable.   Money has become  cheap and  plentiful, external trade  has  expanded markedly and the exchange positions  have become strong.   In Italy the financial situation   has shown signs  of  improvement  and exports  are believed to  have  risen  considerably since  devaluation.   In the United Jtates  steps  have  been  taken to prevent the continued gold influx influencing further the credit structure.   In Norway and  Denmark,  bank  rate  has  been raised as a precaution against excessive  activity.     COAL.    The average weekly output of coal during the thirteen weeks ended  26th December  was 4.66m.  tons  as compared with 4.62 m. tons in  the  corresponding period  a year ago. The average number of wage earners  employed was  slightly more than a  year before.  Exports in December amounted  to 2.97 m. tons as compared  with 2.87 m.  tons  in December,  1955.    The  chief- increases were&apos;to France and Argentina.  Markets taking, lessincluded Algeria, Egypt, Denmark and the Irish Free State,                          -3-
     IRON AND STEEL,   Activity was unabated.   There was some reduction of arrears of unexecuted orders.   Additional steel plant will shortly come into operation.   Pig-iron deliveries sufficed for current requirements.   A few new orders were accepted for delivery during the second quarter. Increased prices for East and West Coast haematite had little affect on business.   Pig-iron output (671,400 tons) was 20% greater than in December, 1935:  total output during 1936 (7,685,700 tons) was the highest since 1920 and 20% more than in 1935.   Crude steel production in December (1,019,200 tons)was over 25% greater than in December, 1935:  total output for 1936 (11,698,200 tons) exceeded all previous records andwas 19% more than in 1935.   Exports of iron and steel inDecember were 205,000 tons - 16,000 tons more than a year before.     Scotland,    Additional steel plant will commence operation very soon.   During 1936 Scottish pig-iron and steel production were respectively 15% and 24% more than in 1935.     North East Coast.  Pig-iron works were in operation throughout the holidays.   One or two additional blastfurnaces are being re-started and additional plant for steelbillets will come into operation shortly.   Pig-iron and steel production in the area during 1936 were respectively 22% and21% more than in 1935.     Sheffield.,    The recent price increases have not affected the heavy volume of business.   Stainless steel output in 1936 was a record and more furnace installationsare in hand.    Local steel production during 1936 was 14% morethan in 1935.     South Wales.   Market conditions continued busy.    Twofurnaces in a steelworks resumed operation after seven yearsidleness.    The tinplate position was satisfactory and mostmakers had good order books and there was a fair volume of overseas enquiry.   Local Pig-iron and steel production during 1936 were respectively 39% and 28% more than in 1935.
   ENGINEERING.   The improvement continued.   A fullrecovery from the depression is reported, the revival beingdue more to normal work for the home market than to Defenceorders.   The outlook for the current year is bright.   Goodoverseas orders for railway material have been obtained.     Exports of machinery in&apos; December were valued at  3.64 m.as compared with  3.32 m.  in December, 1935.   Imports  were 1.63 m.,   530,000 more than a year ago (machine toolsaccounted for more than half this increase).   MOTOR INDUS TR Y.   The number of motor vehicles newlyregistered In November was 32,123 - 3,457 more than a yearago;  the increase in private cars was 1,346.   Theproduction of private cars for October was 30,870 as against28,255 in October, 1935, and the production of commercial vehicles increased from 7,986 to 10,335.   Exports of newprivate cars and chassis in 1936 amounted to 64,787 and ofnew commercial vehicles and chassis to 16,926 - 19.4% and24.2% respectively more than in 1935,   11,452 complete newprivate cars were imported as compared with 12,331. in 1935.   LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES.   Activity generally was maintainedor improved.   Some trades were extremely busy.   It was still difficult to meet demand in the tool trades and,despite new productive units, deliveries of non-ferrous metals were further delayed.   The labour shortage becameacute in the smallwares section and may prevent increasedactivity in  the needle  trade.   ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY,   Activity continued at asatisfactory level particularly on the heavy side.Manuiacturing costs and selling prices have increased.  Thedifficulty  of  securing adequate supplies of raw materials and suitable labour persists.   Consumption of electricityamounted to  2,180 m. units - 13% more than a year before;the increase for  the whole of 1936, compared with 1935,was 15.1%.
   CHEMICALS.  Home sales or alkalies were satisfactory  and exports increased considerably as compared with November.Deliveries of chlorine products were greater than in December, 1935.Sales of industrial nitrogen products were well maintained.  Homesales of dye stuffs were higher than a year ago;  foreign  sales were less.   Home sales or sulphate of ammonia are higher this  seasonthen last (due largely to earlier buying)j  export sales  have declined.   Exports of fine chemical products continued  to  expand,particularly to Empire markets.   Trade in copl tar and wooddistillation products was good, but in pharmaceutical chemicalsremained quiet,   COTTON.   The autumn increase in activity continued until thelatter part of December when there was the usual slackening.Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners were  27.4 m.lbs.  as compared with 28.8. m. in November and 25.4 -m. inDecember, 1935.   Yarn production represented 77% of spinningcapacity, as compared with 72% a year ago.   Raw cotton pricesgenerally increased.   The rise in American yarn prices  continued.Yarn exports at 12.3 in.- lbs. were slightly less than in November(when there was one less working day) but .4 m. lbs. more  then inDecember, 1935.    Exports of piece-goods at 170 in. sq. yds,  were16 m. sq. yds. more than in November and 22 m, sq.yds. more  than  inDecember, 1935.    As compered with November, piece-good  exportsincreased to most oi the important markets, the largest  increasesbeing to India, Australia and Drench lest Africa;  the only countrytaking substantially less was Egypt.           .  ,   SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.     Rayon.  Most sections oi  the weaving trade were reasonablybusy.   Demand tor viscose yarns was  satisfactory and the  tone inLancashire and Yorkshire markets was  quietly confident.   Demand  forstaple fibre improved slightly.   Business in piece-goods remainedsteady.   Exports of rayon yarns declined compared with  December,1935, but exports of piece-goods increased.     Silk.  Trade generally was slacker  than usual  in December.
   WOOL.  General activity was maintained and new business was reported to be fairly satisfactory.    Exports of tops, yarns andtissues increased as compared with November.   Raw wool prices againrose considerably and at the end of the month were on the average34% higher then a year before.     During 1936 general activity was greater and steadier than in1935.   HIDES /IIP LEATHER.   Hide and skin prices advanced further.   Thedifficulty in obtaining advances in leather prices commensurate withthe increased cost of raw materials was further accentuated.Business in the various sections varied from quiet to moderate.   POTTERY.  The industry in November was better employed then forsome years.   Conditions in most sections were satisfactory orimproving, but electrical ware orders were not up to the level ofNovember, 1935.   The tile section continued working to capacity.   BUILDING.  Conditions in the industry were in generalsatisfactory for the time of year, unemployment being less than ayear ago.  The value of house-building plans was, however, less.public works contracting did not come up to expectations.   PIT AIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales in November was6.5% greater than in November,. 1935.  Sales of food and perishablesrose by 6.3% and of other merchandise by 6.7%.  Preliminary returnsfor December indicate a continuance of the upward trend.   CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND).  The drapery trade wasexceptionally good and very satisfactory,Spring orders were booked.All  sections of the furniture etc. departments (Glasgow) were verybusy;  allied factories were  fully employed.   CAN AD I AN TRADE.  Business  activity expanded further  in November.Mining operations continued at a high level.  Total exports were greater than in any November  since 1928.  Nickel exports increased substantially as compared with October, but the decline  in  copperexports was more than seasonal.   Asbestos exports were  greaterthan in any November since  the war.   Newsprint production  was greater than in any previous  month  except October, 1935,
     AUSTRALIAN TRADE,.,  Wool prices further strengthened onthe resumption of buying by Japan.  2,203,000 bales were received into store from the 1st July to the 30th November ascompared with 2,198,000 a year before, the quantity sold orshipped being 1,-082,000 and 1,120,000 respectively.  Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December to 23rd December wereequivalent to 4*8 uw &quot;bushels of wheat as compared with 5.6. m.a year ago.  Butter shipments from 1st July to 26th Decemberwere 34,050 tons as compared with 52,500 a year ago.  Importsof merchandise during November amounted to  9.87 m. (Australiancurrency) as compared with  9 m. a year before.  Recent goodrainfalls have much benefited pastoral districts in Queensland,New South Wales and Victoria.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.  Economic conditions improved furtherduring 1936 and a continuance of progress, though perhaps ata slower rate, is anticipated.     Imports in October were 15.4;u greater than in October, 1935.Exports (excluding gold) were 9% more.  Wool shipments increasedbut diamond exports fell heavily and maize exports werenegligible.  Gold exports were 6.2% more;   the tonnage of orecrushed was the highest yet recorded.  The wool market continuedstrong.  The wheat crop for 1936-7 is estimated at 4.74 m. bags,21.6% less than last year.     GOLONIAL TRADE.  Colonial trade generally is expanding,due mainly to the rise in commodity prices, increased releasesunder the rubber, tin and copper regulation schemes and increased production of other products, especially minerals.  Malaya andthe West African Colonies are likely to benefit most by therecent developments.   In Palestine capital development waschecked last year by the political troubles, but trade in consumption goods seems to have been well  maintained.
     The  immediate prospects for Colonial import trade appear to be  good.     SOUTH AMERICA!! TRADE.   South American countries havebenefited from the world rise in commodity prices.  The outlook is on  the whole favourable and an increase in import trade  is 1ikely.     Argentina.  There was a large surplus of exports over imports in-November, due mainly to heavy maize shipments.   Thevalue  of  exports of meat, wool and hides during January-November  was greater than   * year before.  The weight of ship-ments  of  maize was substantially greater in 1936 (up to24th December) than in 1935, but wheat, linseed and oats shipments were less.  The outlook for present crops is favourable, charterings are on a very large scale, the external value  ofthe peso has risen, the budgetary position is satisfactory  andoptimism prevails.     Brazil.  The surplus of exports over imports during January-October,  1936, was considerably more than a year before.  Themilreis appreciated further.  Coffee shipments during october and November were less than a&apos; year before;  prices were nearly80/o higher at the end of 1936 than a year before.  Brazil fsshare  of  the world coffee trade &quot;has declined, but her cottonprediction is increasing.  The general outlook appears morefavourable than for some years.     Chile.   Imports continued to increase at a greater rate thanexports.  The exchange situation remained difficult in respectof sterling and U.S. dollars.  Economic improvement has been checked by over-development of local industries.     Uruguay[s economic life shows healthy activity.     Colombia is benefitfcing from higher coffee prices.   Theagricultural outlook is bright and confidence is  increasinggenerally.
     Psm.  Good business was done in cotton at advancing priceThe favourable trade balance and the total amount of external trade in 1936 have probably approached the 1929 record figures.     Ecuador.  Business generally was depressed, owing to theuncertain exchange outlook.  Demand for cocoa was strong andthe coffee market was active.     Venezuela.  The demand for coffee and cocoa continued.     Paraguay.   A very satisfactory cotton crop is expected.Confidence  is returning.
