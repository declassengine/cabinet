THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1037.SECRET.                                                          Copy  No.CP. 25 (37).CABINET.REPORT OF COMMITTEE  SET UP  TO CONSIDER DEVELOPMENT        OF CIVIL AVIATION  IN  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM.               Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air,    I CIRCULATE herewith,  for the information of  the Cabinet, copies of theReport of the Committee set up under the Chairmanship of  Sir Henry Mayburyto consider and report upon measures which might be adopted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or by local authorities for assisting in the promotion of civil aviation in the United Kingdom and their probable cost.    The recommendations of the Committee are  clearly summarised on pages 43to 45 of the Report, and  I would particularly draw the attention of my colleagues to the following conclusions and recommendations :     (l) That an  appreciable measure of Government assistance  is at  present          essential to  secure  a satisfactory degree  of development  of civil          aviation in this country, and that such assistance should be given with          the object  of eventually  rendering civil aviation economically self-          supporting.    (2) That it is unlikely that air transport will pay its way in this country under          the conditions that prevail at present, and that in order that services          can be made  self-supporting, it will be necessary to apply restrictions          to avoid unnecessary competition.    (3) That, in consequence, an exclusive licence should for a limited period be          given to a single company or  combination  of companies to  operate          certain main  internal routes.    (4) That a system  of  licensing should also be introduced for  all  regular          internal passenger services, though the licences issued on routes other          than those referred to under (3) should not necessarily be exclusive.    (5) That no  direct State  subsidy should  be  paid to the proprietors of          aerodromes;  but that the Government should for the time being accept          responsibility for the provision of radio facilities in the same  way          that they are at present responsible for the provision of meteorological          facilities and of an air traffic control organisation adequate to secure          the safety and regularity of air communications throughout the United          Kingdom.    I shall in due course submit to the Cabinet concrete proposals arising out ofthe report, together with an estimate of the cost of such proposals.

AIR MINISTRYREPORT  OF  THE   COMMITTEE  TO  CONSIDERTHE  DEVELOPMENT  OF   CIVIL  AVIATION  IN                THE  UNITED  kingdom to :  THE RT. HON. VISCOUNT SWINTON, G.B.E.,  M.C., SECRETARY                    OF STATE  FOR AIR.MY LORD,  We have the honour to present the following Report on the subjects which were referred to us for examination.                      INTRODUCTORY  We were  appointed to  &quot; consider and report upon  measureswhich might be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by localauthorities for assisting in  the  promotion of civil aviation in theUnited Kingdom and  their  probable cost.&quot;  We were further instructed to take into account the requirementsof the Post Office for air mails and the relation between aviation andother forms of transport.  2.  We  have held 23 meetings  and have had the advantage ofhearing the views of representatives of the Association of municipal corporations, the Aerodromes Committee  of that Association, the aerodrome Owners&apos; Association, the Aircraft Operators&apos; Association,Railway Air Services,  Limited, and British Airways, Limited.  Wehave also received and considered written representations submittedby a number of municipalities, companies, and other bodies interestedin aviation.  The representative character of these organisations enabled theirwitnesses to put before us  much helpful  information.  There hasalso  been freely placed at our disposal  the  important materialcollected by the Air Ministry itself in the study of the whole problem,and we desire to acknowledge our indebtedness to the Ministry both for the  value of this material and for the full and clear manner inwhich it has been laid before us.  3.  At an early stage of our inquiry we visited Croydon, the airportof London, and  also  the airport at  Heston, Middlesex, the  twobusiest  aerodromes in the country, of which one  is owned by theState and the other privately owned.  4.  In the course  of our inquiry we were requested to  furnish youwith  our  views upon certain matters in regard  to which decisions had become urgent.   The  control of air  traffic  at the privately owned airport  of Heston was  in  danger of lapsing owing to the inability  of the  airport owners to  maintain it.  The density ofuncontrolled air traffic in the regions of Manchester, Portsmouth
and Glasgow was giving rise to the risk of collisions in the air.  Werecommended that, as an interim and temporary measure, control should be exercised, at all these places at the charge of Air Votessubject to a contribution from the aerodrome owners.  Furthermore,  in  accordance with your request, we reported toyou on the necessity for a large airport to the East of London, andwe have been concerned with the question of the preservation ofthe Heston airport.  Our consideration of these subjects somewhatdelayed the general progress  of our investigation, but assisted toilluminate its path.  The absence of two of our members  in  America on importantGovernment  business connected  with the establishment of trans-Atlantic air services perforce suspended our  deliberations for nearly three months.  We have divided our report into three parts.  The first summarises the history of civil aviation in the United Kingdom and describes the conditions which obtain to-day.   In the second part we examine these conditions  and in  the third we record our  conclusions andrecommendations.
117                           PART I   THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION  IN  THE                     UNITED KINGDOM  5. Civil aviation  in the  United  Kingdom may conveniently be divided into four main groups :      (1) Private flying, i.e. privately owned aircraft and flying clubs.     (2) Aerial displays and pleasure flights.     (3) Special charter.     (4) Scheduled commercial flying.            I. PRIVATE FLYING AND FLYING CLUBS  6. At the end of the  war it  was realised that aircraft producedfor service purposes were of little value for private flying, but it wasnot until 1925, after numerous  attempts  had been made, that asuitable light aeroplane was produced in this country with an engineof 75 h.p. and capable of seating two persons.  7. To increase interest in flying, the Air Ministry decided in 1925to give financial assistance to flying clubs equipped with aeroplanesof this type.   By 1927 the results obtained led the Air Ministry towiden  the scope of the scheme, and a three-year agreement wasentered into  with  13 clubs.  It provided a maximum  subsidy of 2,000 for  each club, and  payments  were  based mainly on thenumber of pilots&apos; licences obtained by members.  8. In 1929, National  Flying  Services, a company  with a wide range of activities, was formed.  This company entered into anagreement with the Air Ministry to provide in the United Kingdom20 aerodromes and 80  landing  grounds within a  period of  threeyears in return for a subsidy based on the number of pilots&apos; licences issued to members of its affiliated clubs.  In 1930 a new agreement was made with 16  light aeroplane clubs,  and  the subsidy paid inrespect of each pilot&apos;s licence was reduced to the level of the subsidypaid to National Flying  Services.  9.  The economic depression  of  1931-32 then set  in and this,combined with the reduction in the subsidy,  made  the  financialposition of  the clubs very difficult.  In 1932  the agreement with national Flying Services was cancelled, as the  Company had failedto carry out its undertakings.  As the result of a five-year agreement made during 1932, each club can now receive  a maximum annualsubsidy of  2,700.   Full rates of  25 in respect of the issue, and  10for the renewal, of a pilot&apos;s licence are paid by the Air Ministry until 1,200 is earned, after which half rates are paid for the remainingportion of the subsidy.   Up to the end of  1935,  152,500 had been paid in subsidies to Dight Aeroplane  Clubs.  In this year the totalnumber of  such Clubs,  operating  with and without  Government
assistance, was about 70, and the aggregate membership was over11,000.   The  number of private aircraft owned mainly by clubtrained pilots  increased at a rapid rate between 1926 and 1930, but since then this rate has not  been maintained.  One result of the flying club movement is that, through the channels of club member-ship and ownership of private aircraft, many men of influence anda considerable amount of financial backing have been attracted  to civil aviation.  10. Flying clubs and owners of private aircraft, individually and through their representative  organisations,  the Royal  Aero Cluband the Automobile  Association, have continually advocated theprovision of more  aerodromes, though  from  the  private owners&apos;standpoint, the  lack  of  permanent aerodromes was not  always aserious  handicap, as private aircraft are  permitted to  land at un-licensed aerodromes, and a number of fields all oyer the country werefrequently used.  But the use of such fields has often proved incon-venient and the difficulty  of obtaining  fields large enough to begranted a licence for instructional flying, combined with the increasein the number of clubs, both subsidised and  unsubsidised, which began in 1930, resulted in pressure being brought to bear on munici-municipalities  to provide aerodromes which would permit clubs in various parts of the country to begin  operations.  11. The  origin of  a  number of  municipal  aerodromes can betraced to this  demand.  As  the requirements of a  club  consisted ofan area not greatly in excess of 400 yards in all directions, there was little demand  from this source for  larger aerodromes.   Ten smallprivate  aerodromes  were also  established  and licensed between1931 and 1934 to meet the requirements of instructional flying.  12. Many owners of private aircraft  were taught  to fly by theclubs, but after the initial  rapid  increase from 1926 onwards, thenumber of these aircraft owners did not increase.  It appears that,while every year there were some new purchasers of aircraft, former owners  sold theirs.   To-day there  are relatively few pilots,  whohave owned aircraft  over  an  uninterrupted period  of  ten years.The cost of aircraft ownership in  the past has been  comparativelyhigh in  relation to the use to which a private aeroplane  can be putfor  family or  commercial purposes.  Private flying has, therefore,tended to develop more as a sporting or recreational activity alongclub lines.   Recently, less expensive types of very light aeroplaneshave appeared and this may lead to some extension in  the field ofprivate  flying.         II. PLEASURE FLIGHTS AND  AERIAL DISPLAYS  13. Pleasure flights began to be offered to the public soon after theend of the war and were conducted by a number of professional pilotsflying types of war-time aircraft which could be operated from smallfields licensed temporarily for  the  purpose  by  the Air  Ministry.
118Pleasure flights on a more highly organised basis were  given from1931 onwards by what were colloquially known as &quot; Flying Circuses.&quot;These toured the country during the summer months, each  onevisiting some 100 or more localities and providing displays of flyingfollowed by  pleasure flights for the public.   Wherever possible,permanent aerodromes were  used and the revenue accruing to the proprietors  of these aerodromes on fine days was sometimes sub-stantial.  Where no  permanent aerodromes  were available, fieldscontinued to be temporarily licensed by  the Air Ministry.   Suchfields however in general made no contribution towards the increaseof permanent aerodrome facilities in the country.  14. In 1929 an examination was carried out of some 300 temporarilylicensed sites recorded in the  Air Ministry.   It was found that, sincethe  date when the temporary licence had expired, many sites hadbeen ploughed up, built over,  or otherwise rendered unusable by aircraft.   A  number,  otherwise suitable, had become  dangerousowing to the proximity of high tension cables erected after the dateof the  licence.   Other sites, although  suitable for the war-timeaeroplanes used for pleasure nights,  were too small for aircraft of post-war manufacture.  Only a  very small number remained whichwere of any real value.  15. Mention must, however, be made of the propaganda in favourof municipal aerodromes conducted by  the promoters  of  certainaerial displays.  This undoubtedly had the effect of increasing theinterest of municipalities in aerodromes, particularly as the promoters of some of the displays offered their technical advice to assist in the selection of suitable sites.                    III. SPECIAL CHARTER  16. For practical purposes, this class of commercial flying can besaid  to date  from about 1926, when  2-seater light aircraft  for civiluse  were first placed on the market in  any&apos; quantities.  Certainnewspapers  and press agencies took early advantage of.the servicesof air taxi firms which were enabled to keep going by contracts withthem. Although some of the  first air  taxi firms were unable tocontinue in  business, this class of  activity has shown a steady increase.  Up-to-date  equipment  is  now employed and the moreexperienced  air taxi  pilots,  who have often had to fly where no ground  organisation  existed, are among  the  most skilled &quot; in thecountry.  Many air taxi aircraft are equipped  with radio, and fly in conditions similar to  those in which scheduled commercial aircraftoperate.   Owing to the regulation that a field need only be licensedwhen if  is used regularly for commercial purposes, air taxi pilotshave been able to land in unlicensed fields when only single journeyswere undertaken for a special purpose.  Thus air taxi work has donelittle to produce a demand for permanent aerodromes, except perhaps in some. localities where fields  suitable  for use by aircraft cannoteasily be found.      .      .....&apos; -    -       --  .            -
            TV. SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL FLYINGHistorical summary and account of present conditions  17. The  first attempt to operate an  internal air service  on acommercial scale in this country was in October, 1922.   As part ofa through service to the  Continent, Daimler Airways Limitedconducted a Government subsidised service for about twelve monthsbetween  Manchester  and  London.  An experimental subsidisedservice between Belfast and Liverpool was flown from 1st May to18th June in  1924 by Northern Air Lines Limited,  and mail wascarried at  a surcharge of \d.  an oz.   In 1925  the same Companyflew daily a freight service between Stranraer and Belfast.  these services were not financially successful.  18. In 1929 the four amalgamated railway companies,  with  theapproval and  support of the Government of the day, sought and obtained from Parliament powers  to  establish, own and operateaerodromes and air services.  These powers were limited to internal and certain European services and there were various obligations and regulatory provisions.  The companies were also empowered, toenter into and carry into effect agreements with one another for theprovision of any  air transport service  which  any of them wereempowered to provide and also to enter into working agreements with other bodies  or  persons providing air transport services.  19. From June to September, 1930, a thrice weekly service between london Birmingham Manchester and Liverpool was  operated by imperial Airways Limited with the  assistance of small grants-in-aid from the municipal  authorities concerned.  The results were  not sufficiently encouraging to justify the reopening of  the  service inthe following year, when no internal services are recorded.  20. In 1932 a small beginning was made once more with services between  Blackpool and the Isle of Man, Portsmouth and the Isle of wight, and Romford and  Clacton-on-Sea.  Most of these services were operated between June and September.  In the latter month an air  ferry service was inaugurated between Bristol and Cardiff  but during the winter flew only &quot; on demand &quot;.  21. In 1933 eighteen services were  flown by  thirteen Companies.One of these services, begun in December, was to the  channel islands.   Another, between  Birmingham,  Cardiff and Plymouth,was operated  by Imperial Airways on behalf of the Great WesternRailway, under the powers obtained in 1929.  22. In 1934 there were fifteen Companies operating.  A numberof changes occurred in the services flown during the  year  but therewere approximately  thirty-four of these  over various periods.   TheGreat Western  Railway services were  taken  over  by the newlyformed Railway Air Services, a Company in which equal shares were held by  the four railway companies and  Imperial Airways Limited,One line between London and the Isle of Wight was flown by SpartanAir Lines Limited on behalf of Railway Air  Services.   London,
Scottish and Provincial Airways Limited  flew between Leeds and paris, stopping at Nottingham and London.  The Royal NetherlandsAir Lines operated between June and October from Amsterdam toLiverpool via Hull and carried 387 passengers between the last twoplaces alone.   (This line, however, is an international and not  an internal air service).   Highland Airways Limited  for the first timecarried the internal mail under formal contract with the Postmaster-General between Inverness and the Orkney Islands without additionalcharge to the public for air transmission.  23. This experiment being  successful, the Postmaster-General, inNovember,  1934,  adopted the policy of sending first-class mail  byany satisfactory service offering a material acceleration in delivery,subject  to  suitable  terms  being  arranged with  the  operatingcompanies.   Internal air services have since been  used regularly  formail conveyance  between London,  Belfast and  Glasgow, to  theOrkney and Shetland Islands and to  the Isle of Man.   Air  MailServices to and from the Channel Islands are also  contemplatedwhen improved landing facilities are available.  24.  In 1935  there were nineteen  companies operating seventy-sixservices.  An  important development  was the  institution of a regular  service between England  and  the Channel Isles.  Thefollowing figures shew that there was a marked increase in activityduring this year in comparison with  1934.  The route mileage rose from 3,265 to  5,810,  the aircraft mileage increased by 95 per cent.from 1,559,000 to  3,037,000, and 121,559 passengers were carried, asagainst 72,441, an increase of 68 per cent. The weight of mails and freight carried  rose from 402 tons to 885 tons,  25.  1936 has shown a decrease in the number of companies, there being  now sixteen  operating only fifty-four services.  The routemileage has fallen  to 4,019.  There are fewer services flying over landbut there  is an increase in the competition among the companies operating over water.  26.  Although the conditions governing the internal air services inother countries are widely different from our own, it is of interest to note developments abroad in  respect of such services.  In France, there was very  little operation of regular internal  airlines until 1935, when &quot; Air Bleu &quot; was formed for the carriage of mails only over six routes radiating from  Paris.  In Germany, internal air lines have been more  numerous and by may, 1936, the total internal  route mileage amounted to some 7,000miles.  In the United  States of America,  the internal routes for  1935shewed a  total mileage of  26,267, the aircraft mileage flown was55,380,353, and the number of passengers carried was 746,946.  the weight of goods and mails conveyed by air was 7,824 tons.  This wasa 60 per cent, increase over the figure for 1934.
   27. Comparisons are frequently made between the development ofinternal aviation  in  this  country and in America.   It  must beremembered that  the distance between the Atlantic and  Pacificseaboards of the United States is 3,000 miles and the large centres of  population  are widely separated so that air transport effectsan important saving  of time.  The demand for it naturally arose,and the effort made, to meet that demand was supported by public expenditure of many millions of dollars.   In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, only comparatively short journeys are possible and the scope for development is thus, inthe existing conditions of aviation, much less than in  many foreigncountries.  We deal fully with, this factor in Part II of our report.When account is taken of all the circumstances, it is clear that a greatdeal of  enterprise and energy has been shewn in the inauguration ofair lines .in these  Islands.  Air Services  proceeding  overseas are outside  our terms  of reference, but it is fitting that we should alsohere note the great progress which has been made in regard to these services by the joint efforts of the government and those concerned incivil aviation, to say nothing of further important developments atpresent  under consideration.  28. In Appendix I will be found four maps shewing the routes andthe companies in operation in each year from 1933-1936.  29. We have received  evidence from the Air Line companies operating in this country and from the Aerodrome Owners association in Great Britain and we may appropriately continue our account of thehistory  and present conditions of civil ayiation by specific referenceto certain parts of that evidence.  The Air Line Companies tendered evidence showing  that they areexperiencing considerable difficulties.  The great majority of the mare working at a loss, which in one instance amounted,  in 1934, to asmuch as  44,000.   The principal  handicaps from which they statethey are suffering may be summarised as follows :-     &quot;A.   The  ground organisation to  assist  navigation and  to     ensure safety  is inadequate to permit flying in all  weathers and     at night.   As long as regularity is dependent upon the weather,     no  air line can inspire  in the public the same support as surface     transport can  do.  Lack of night flying facilities restricts the     number of services which can be operated, particularly during     the winter, and it is difficult to employ aircraft for more than     about  600 hours per annum.   It was stated that, unless aircraft     can be employed for at least double this period annually, over-     head charges  prohibit profitable operation. -      B.   The  surface communications between towns and their     aerodromes are slow ;  this greatly reduces the time that an air     journey should save.   The cost of surface transport to and from     the aerodrome is  a heavy charge on air line operators.&apos;      C.  .Many aerodromes are,  inadequate, in size, have  poor     surfaces and lack facilities.;to handle passengers in reasonable
    comfort and to deal promptly with mails and freight.   It was    also  mentioned  that certain  aerodromes  owned by  air  line    operators  are  made available on unfavourable  conditions to    other operators on  competing routes.  Opinion was expressed    that  the ownership of  aerodromes by persons  or companies    financially  interested in air line operations is in many ways    undesirable.      D.  There is a shortage of experienced pilots which many of    the companies are unable to overcome owing to the difficulties    and cost of training.A. Ground Organisation  30.  As  regards point A, we are informed that the most necessaryground equipment to-day is the radio service:  In  or above theclouds, in fog and at night, that is whenever  the ground cannot beseen, safety can only be maintained if the pilot is  guided by radio.When landmarks  cannot assist navigation, the pilot can  learn hisposition and direct his flight  with the help of radio bearings.   Radioalso enables the pilot to obtain essential  news of  the atmosphericconditions into which he will be flying.  When the pilot cannot seeto avoid collisions, the traffic control staff on the ground can learnby radio the position of his aircraft and those of other radio-equippedaircraft and, by regulating their heights and courses,  prevent them from heading into danger.  31.  We are informed that radio stations for communication with aircraft were provided  by the Air Ministry in 1920 at  Croydon,Pulham,  Lympne,  Castle  Bromwich,  Manchester  and  Renfrew.These stations  however,  were not  equipped  to  give directionalguidance.  It is interesting to note that the Castle Bromwich,Manchester and Renfrew  stations  were provided to  assist variousinternal services about  to be inaugurated, many  of which neveroperated  and others were very short lived.  After about three years,the stations at  Castle Bromwich and Manchester  were dismantledbut Renfrew was maintained for the transmission of meteorologicalmessages.  About  twelve years later, the station was  transferred tothe R.A.F. aerodrome at Abbotsinch but  very soon afterwards air services began to operate from Renfrew  and a demand  for radioassistance arose.  This was  met under the Air Ministry 1934 Pro-gramme which is referred to below.  32.  The value of directional guidance by radio did not begin to be fully appreciated until 1925.  In that year, direction-finding apparatuswas added to  the station at Lympne to  work with that already established at Croydon and Pulham to assist the London-ContinentalAir Services.   A radio-directed  flight between Paris and Londonwithout sight of the ground is recorded in 1923  as  a noteworthyevent.  The apparatus  at that time  was not fully developed andreliability could not be guaranteed.
   From 1925 onwards the radio stations at Croydon, Pulham andLympne were operated in conjunction to give the pilot the positionof  his  aircraft.  When in  1931  the  Corporation of  Manchesterconstructed Barton Aerodrome, the Air Ministry, at the request ofthe Corporation, provided a station at that aerodrome, the Corpora-tion contributing towards the annual cost.   33. In 1933 it became apparent that the radio stations at Croydon,Pulham, Lympne and  Manchester were insufficient to work bothContinental and inland air services.   In 1934 the Air Ministry obtained authority to provide a &quot; net-work &quot;  of radio stations to assist inland airways, the busy London-Continental airways requiring the undivided attention of the stations at Croydon, Pulham and Lympne, as they do to this day.   34. The first stage  of the  &quot; network &quot; plan provided for five&quot; permanent &quot; stations of the  kind installed at  Croydon and Man-chester.  As many of the air lines had to be regarded as experimental,nine  &quot; mobile &quot; stations were also ordered.  A &quot; mobile &quot;  station is  one in which the transmitting apparatus is housed in a wheeledtrailer.  These &quot; mobile &quot;  stations are  still operating and  until a fixed housing is found for them, direction-finding facilities can onlybe given during the hours of daylight.  Between sunset and sunrise,when radio waves are subject to distortion,  only permanent stationssuitably sited can give accurate guidance.  35. As  additional stations  were provided, interference betweenstations arose  owing to the very limited  number of wave-bandsallotted  to civil  aviation.  The stations have,  therefore,  been divided into &quot; medium range &quot; and &quot; short range &quot; and so appor-tioned as to meet the needs  of traffic while interfering with eachother as little as possible.   There exist, or will shortly exist, 11medium range and 4 short range stations,  apart from those serving the Croydon-Continental Airways  and those to be provided  in theChannel Islands by the local government.  36. How  congested  the wave-bands allotted  to civil aviationhave become may be appreciated from the following figures.  whereas in  1932 there were 8,500 occasions when  aircraft were worked byradio, in  1935 this number  had risen to  66,000 ;  the number of direction bearings given rose from 3,000 to  over 32,000, and specialweather reports transmitted increased from nearly 5,000 to  16,000.It  is estimated that in  1937  the radio traffic figures will be doublethose of 1935.  37. In an attempt to relieve the congestion caused by the increas-ing number of radio messages, intercommunication between  groundstations has been relegated to land lines, and special teleprinter and telephone circuits were provided to carry meteorological and trafficmessages.  We are informed  that the growing congestion could stillfurther be relieved if, as on Continental air routes, wireless telegraphywere employed instead of  radiotelephony.   The change  would
                               15                           121require a wireless operator to be  carried on the aircraft  and thison small commercial aircraft is uneconomic.  38.  The radio &quot; network &quot; referred to above has without doubtprovided a most necessary form of assistance to inland air servicesand, as a temporary measure, has  been of great value.  By itself itis insufficient to provide security as it cannot guard against the riskof collision.  Indeed, by the greater volume of traffic that radiomakes possible, the risk is increased.  The heavy traffic on  theContinental airways has made it necessary to evolve at Croydon asvstem of control during periods of low visibility to prevent aircraftcolliding.  39.  This control  of traffic may be divided into  two sections Flight Control and  Aerodrome  Control.  Flight Control, which deals with aircraft flying between aerodromescomprises :     (i) co-ordination  of  ground  direction-finding  and   meteoro-         logical services,    (ii) recording the course,  height and  speed of aircraft  flying         in the controlled area,   (iii) advising changes of course and  height to avoid risk  of         collision and    (iv) setting in motion rescue procedure in times of distress.  Aerodrome  Control,  which  relates to  aircraft approaching  an aerodrome to land,  or leaving it, comprises :     (a) Control of  aircraft manoeuvring  on  the surface of  the         aerodrome,    (b) giving the &quot; all clear &quot; to aircraft about to take-off,    (c) allotting order of precedence to aircraft about to land and    (d) supervision  and control of  the aerodrome equipment.  40.  At Croydon,  the control  was originally confined  to  the aero-drome but  later was perforce extended to  cover an  area embracingthe Continental airways leading  to Croydon.  The single controlstation of the London Airport, therefore, exercises the dual functionsmentioned, although we are informed it is not essential that theyshould always be combined.  We  would point out that &quot;  control &quot;at present is  largely advisory and exercised by agreement with  airline companies,  as powers have not existed to make it  compulsory.  41.  Until the summer of 1934  there was  little necessity for  air traffic control elsewhere than on the London-Continental  Airways.During that  summer, the need  for it  became evident on the  air routes converging on Heston and  on Manchester.  The proprietorsof Heston Airport established a control station on their aerodromebut found by the autumn of 1935 that they were unable to shoulderthe responsibilities involved.  The question of the necessity for this control was remitted to us and we recommended that in the interestsof safety  it should be maintained, if need be,  by the  Air Ministry.
  42. The volume of traffic worked by the radio stations at Man-chester, Portsmouth, and Renfrew,  as well as instances of narrowlyavoided disasters brought to our notice, convinced us that the dangerof collision has become serious and  we felt compelled, as set out in para. 4, to recommend to the Air Ministry that control of air trafficshould immediately be instituted in those areas.  Measures to effect this have now been taken.B. Surface Communications  43. As regards point B  in paragraph  29, we have  ascertainedthe average lapse of time between taking up a passenger at  a towncentre  and. seating  him in  an aeroplane.   Working on informationpublished in the time-tables, we found  that, taking an  average over 54 places, the period was nearly 25 minutes.   The low averageoverall speed of air  journeys which  are recorded in Appendices V(a)and V(b) is accounted for by the time taken in reaching the aerodromes.C. Defects of Aerodrome  44. As regards point C in paragraph 29,  the effect of the evidencetendered to  us was  that all aerodromes, with the possible exceptionof the two  largest in the country,  are inadequate  in  size whenvisibility is very low and, as the  public naturally expect regularityof service, the companies have to attempt to maintain their scheduleseven in  bad  weather.  Even in fine weather it was  urged thatcertain  aerodromes are inadequate  in size for the larger and more modern t3&apos;pes of aircraft.  45. As to the question of aerodrome surfaces, we are advised thatminimum safety requirements are laid down by the Air Ministry asa condition of licensing.  If at any  time these requirements  are not met, it is open to the Air Ministry to suspend the licence  untiladequate improvements have been made.  46. The provision of aerodromes suitably sited and equipped is,of course,  vital to the proper development  of aviation  and we accordingly directed our enquiries towards ascertaining the  present state of civil aerodromes in Great Britain and the conditions in whichthey had become established.  47. In  1924 there were  in  England and  Scotland forty-threeaerodromes  for land aeroplanes.  Twenty-six of these were for theuse  of  the  Royal  Air Force,  but were   available  under  certain conditions for civil  aircraft.   Of the seventeen civil aerodromes, two(at Brooklands and Hendon) belonged to private companies andthere was one landing ground at  Wittering  open for the use ofaviators by the courtesy of the Marquess of Exeter.   None of thesecivil aerodromes could be said to  have been specifically designed forthe use of commercial air traffic.  There were, however, five Govern-ment owned aerodromes controlled by the  Department  of CivilAviation.  These were Croydon, Lympne,  Castle  Bromwich,  Man-chester and  Renfrew, and there were  also three  small emergencylanding grounds on the London-Continental air route.
  48. The early belief in the possibility of internal air services isshown by the fact that the Government retained, with a view tosuch  services,  the  aerodromes  at  Birmingham, Manchester andRenfrew and equipped them with wireless.   (The Manchester aero-drome at Alexandra Park no longer exists, its place having beentaken by the municipal aerodrome at  Barton which is now beingsuperseded by a new one at Ringway.   Castle Bromwich aerodromeis now controlled by the Royal Air Force but is used by one air lineoperating company ;  Renfrew aerodrome has been taken over bythe municipality.)  49. In 1924,  municipal and  privately owned commercial aero-dromes for scheduled services did not exist.   In 1928 the Air Ministryissued a circular letter to municipalities, whose populations exceeded20,000, calling attention to the need for municipal aerodromes, inorder that the public might be enabled to take full advantage of air transport.  From that day  onwards the call for  municipal aero-dromes was  taken up  by numerous individuals  and organisationsprominent among which were flying clubs that were springing up allover the country.  Many such clubs  and, also, the organisationknown as National Flying Services put forward offers of management.When internal air services were about to come into being would-beair line operators joined in the demand.  In 1933 the London Chamberof Commerce  convened  at the  Mansion  House  &quot; The  AirportsConference &quot; over which H.R.H. The  Prince  of Wales graciouslyconsented to preside.  50. By  July, 1936,  as  a result  of  these various measures, 30municipal aerodromes had been licensed,  17 sites had been purchasedand 4 sites reserved in town planning schemes.  Air line operatingcompanies were using 18  of  the  municipal  aerodromes alreadylicensed, as well as 25 privately owned civil aerodromes and two RoyalAir Force Stations  The last named were being  used provisionallyand a certain number of privately owned aerodromes were little morethan fields for  which operators had themselves  obtained licenses.Many of  these fields, we are informed,  are adequate only in goodweather for small  and now obsolescent types of aircraft.  51. Of the  present  municipal aerodromes three are of wartimeconstruction  though  modifications  have been made.  The  others have been planned expressly for the purpose of commercial air traffic and it is interesting,  therefore, to examine  the standards to whichthey have been built.  52. In February, 1929, the Air Ministry issued a pamphlet entitled&quot; Notes on the Location, Size and General Requirements of a Site fora Permanent Aerodrome &quot;.   It was there stated that the dimensionsof an aerodrome to be used by the larger types  of aircraft  shouldnot be  less than 600 yards in all directions and should, if possible,be 800 to 1,000 yards. In  January, 1935, a revised pamphlet was issued in which the same advice was repeated.  (351 OS)                                                     B *3
  53. We are informed that municipalities were almost invariablycounselled to acquire a site of the larger dimensions named but tosurface  and  otherwise  prepare only enough of  the  area  to  meet their immediate requirements, adding to this as the needs of trafficdictated.  As we have shown above, the appeal for municipal  aero-dromes came partly from flying clubs and these, with owners of privateaircraft, were the first to make use of them.  Light aircraft requiredsmall aerodromes, and municipalities doubtless considered  that thepreparation of the minimum area mentioned  in the Air  Ministrypamphlet was all that was justified at the time.  54. The overall sizes of aerodromes in Great Britain are published(The effective sizes, owing to surrounding obstructions, are usuallysomewhat smaller.)  As the average length of the shortest  runwaysat a number of municipal  aerodromes is only 685 yards, it is clearthat very little more than the minimum recommendations made bythe Air Ministry in 1929 have been generally adopted.   The dimen-sions of only two aerodromes, one of which is Croydon, are greaterthan 1,000 yards and at seven municipal aerodromes are between800 and 1,000 yards.  55. The  greater speed of the commercial aircraft, introduced in1934, was  obtained  by better  streamline and by using less  wing-area in proportion to the  weight  of the aircraft.  These aeroplanestend to have a flat angle of glide  and a relatively  high  speed of approach and, consequently, require larger aerodromes in  which toland when visibility is low.  A wireless device to assist them  to do this with greater safety  has been  installed at  many Continentalaerodromes but only recently introduced into this country.  It canhowever only be used at  aerodromes where  the landing area is adequate in size and the approaches are unobstructed.  56. As a result of these developments, the minimum requirementsof 1929 have now become inadequate and the former maximum sizeis now the standard for regular  commercial use (cf.  paragraphs 52and 53).  Severer restrictions are required on the height of buildings and other erections along the air approaches.  A general description of the requirements for a standard commercial airport will be  foundin Appendix  III.   57. From enquiries we  have made we accept as  generally well founded the statement  of operating companies concerning  the inadequacy of passenger facilities at aerodromes.  Such accommo-dation as exists in many places is well adapted for the requirementsof a flying club but not for public air services.   The cost  of appro-priate accommodation can be justified if it is to be  used over  aconsiderable period of time. D.  Shortage of Pilots   58. As regards point D in paragraph 29, we deal with this question at a later stage of our report (paragraphs 117 and 156).
  59. The  evidence given by representatives  of the AerodromeOwners Association in Great Britain may be summarised as follows:   The outlay on civil aerodromes, in the United Kingdom since 1929has been considerable.  A large part of this, it is stated, has been incurred by municipal authorities as a result of the encouragementgiven by the Government.  The return on this outlay has, however,been relatively small and the revenue is insufficient in most  cases tomeet  capital charges, apart from the expenses of maintenance and operation.   The view was expressed that as civil aerodromes  are ofnational value, the State should contribute, during the developmentperiod of aviation, a sum equivalent to the annual  losses incurred.We shall refer to this later in Part II of our Report.  (Paragraph 100).  60.  The  Association  further  requested  that  the following in-formation should be provided :       1. An indication of the main air routes within the United    Kingdom.      2. Where the main termini and junctions on these routes are      3. What plans aerodrome owners should make to provide for      (a) an aerodrome for every type of air traffic in all conditions ;      (b) an aerodrome suitable for all normal conditions, and      (c) a landing ground for limited use.  It was stated that until            this guidance is forthcoming many  municipalities felt            unable to proceed with the development of their  aero-            dromes.      4. The Air Ministry was also asked to take practical measures    to make regular air services possible over these routes.  61.  We were advised that the above requests had been addressedto your predecessor in May, 1935, and that a special &quot;Survey Section&quot;had been established in the Air Ministry to investigate them.   Theresults of these investigations have been of great value to us in out enquiry and may be conveniently summarised at this  stage of our report.  62.  The national route mileage flown in Great  Britain since 1933is set out below.  Many routes were  traversed by more than one company and it is interesting to compare the national route mileagewith the total companies&apos; route mileage as indicating the extent towhich competition has developed.to be.

  63. In the period  1933-1936, seven companies ceased operating.A number of others have been reformed, sometimes under differentnames, and some amalgamations have taken place.  64. An analysis of the stages flown by internal air lines in  1935is  shown in Appendix IV.  The  stages  are  divided into eightconvenient groups to show the effects of competing surface transport on  different  kinds of  route  from  the  standpoint  of  time saved.Comparisons of the  frequency of services offered  by air  and by surface transport are also shown.  65. The first group  indicates that air services, when competing with good railway services, were slower than the fastest train onstages of less than  100 miles, showed  a small  saving of time onstages of a little over 100 miles and saved about If hours on stages of  nearly 200 miles.  66. The second group comprises routes which did not cross water and where the average speed  of trains was less than 30 m.p.h.  Forthe purpose  of a fair comparison, only those  stages were taken which were operated within 130 miles of Rugby, that is to say overCentral  England.  The area embraces  Bristol, Blackpool,  Hull,London and Bournemouth.   Air stages of under 50 miles were slower than the fastest train, and air stages of about 100 miles showed  a saving of approximately  one hour.  The  frequency of the trainservices was six times higher than that of the air services.  It will be  noticed that  a marked saving of time was shown onstages serving outlying parts  of Great Britain and on those crossingwater (Groups 3 and 4 illustrate the former and Groups 5 and 6 thelatter).  67. There was only  one  stage over 200 miles in length in GreatBritain.  To discover the saving  in time effected on longer airjourneys it  is  necessary to  consider those entailing  intermediatestops or air connections.  Only six such journeys,  not  crossingwater, could be made in 1935.  Disregarding the two services  mentioned below, we find that theaverage  length of the remaining  four was about 250 miles, the longest  being 330.   The average  number of intermediate stops wastwo and it  is reasonable to  calculate a delay of at least 15 to 20minutes for  each stop on  an air journey.   The average saving in transit time effected on these four air journeys was 2J hours.   Of the two services omitted,  one made  four  intermediate stops,which must have occasioned a total delay  of at  least an hour, withthe result that the  time saved  was only  1 hour 18 minutes on ajourney of  215 miles. The other service  over 247 miles was in competition with a train averaging over 60 m.p.h., with the resultthat the time saved by the air journey was only 35 minutes.   On thisair service only one intermediate stop was made.   68. The average speed over single stages on internal air services isshown in Appendix V(a) and  the speeds  of longer journeys are shown
12in Appendix V (b).  The stages of the journeys are measured betweentown centres  and the times have been taken from published time-tables.  The fares charged on internal air services in 1936 varied between9-4 pence and 2-5 pence  per passenger mile, the average over allroutes being 3-8 pence.  69. Complete figures for regularity of services are not available forall routes.  Generally speaking,  the  services flying in  southern england enjoy better weather conditions  than those in the Northand consequently fly with greater regularity.  70. Figures showing load factors are not complete for all airlinecompanies.   The proportion of seats sold to seats  offered over 29stages flown by five companies during July, 1935, was 22 per cent.,but the total loads are not known.  One company,  not included inthese five, showed a load  factor of just under 30 per cent, for allthe services it operated during that year.  The continuity of air services over each of the internal routes in1935 is shown tabulated in Appendix VI.
                           PAET n  71. We propose now to examine the subject under the four main headings adopted in Part I.  In this examination and in framingour  recommendations we have considered that  an  appreciablemeasure of Government assistance is desirable, and indeed essentialat this  stage, to secure  a satisfactory degree of development  andthat such assistance should be given with the objective of eventuallyrendering  Civil Aviation economically self-supporting.            I.  PRIVATE FLYING  AND FLYING CLUBS  72. Many Flying Clubs would have been unable to exist withoutthe subsidies  they have received  from  the Government, and thecheap tuition and practice flying which  they were  thus enabled tooffer have doubtless contributed largely to the growth in the numberof those who have learned to fly.  Apart, however,  from these results,  the  pilots trained at clubs have formed nuclei at various points in the country for encouraging an interest in flying generally and in many cases they have provided the stimulus for the develop-ment of aerodromes.  But it has to be recognised that, while giving a valuable trainingin airmanship and tending to maintain a keen interest in the wider aspects of flying, club and private flying is in the main a recreationalactivity.  Few club and privately-owned aircraft  are equipped withthe comparatively  expensive apparatus  necessary  to enable themto be flown safely in all weathers, and  for this and  other reasons the gap between private  and commercial flying is tending to widen.  73. The future scope  for the private aeroplane as a  means oftransport  for business and  social purposes must  for the presentremain  a  matter of conjecture.  The time has  certainly not yet arrived  when any widespread extension  of  private flying for such purposes,  even  over long distances, can be  anticipated.  So faras can be foreseen at present the comparatively high expense involvedboth in maintaining  a private aeroplane and in  other respects islikely to be a limiting factor for some time to come.  We do  not,however, ignore the future possibilities of development in this field and we  have borne them in  mind in forming our  recommendations,particularly in regard to  the siting of aerodromes  and the control ofthe air (cf. Paragraphs 120, 121 and 148).          II.  AERIAL DISPLAYS AND PLEASURE FLIGHTS  74. The small  groups of commercial pilots who were engaged in providing pleasure flights all over the country developed later  intolarger and more highly organised units  which have visited almost all the larger and many of  the smaller centres of population.  Bythis means, a considerable number of people in these islands havebeen given  an intimate  contact with  flying and many thousands
 received their  &quot; baptism of the air.&quot;  Representatives of munici- municipalities were invited to fly, and we have no doubt that their experi- ence convinced them of the part that this form of transport was capable of playing in the life of  their communities.                     III. SPECIAL CHARTER   75. Early work done by charter firms was a good deal handicapped by weather conditions  and by inadequate equipment  and ground organisation.   To-day special charter work is  done in conditions more akin to air line operation with a consequent gain in regularity. Any improvements made in ground equipment which increase the safety  of flying in all weathers must benefit special charter firms and enable them better to supplement and assist the air lines.  The charges by special charter  firms are  normally somewhat  higher than those of air line companies.              IV.  SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL FLYING A.  Developments since 1933  76. From an examination of the services of the air line companies operating during the years 1933 to 1936 (see Appendix I) it becomes apparent that the only lines that have existed throughout the whole period  are those which,  drawing their traffic  from one  or  more mainland aerodromes,  cross stretches of water and show the most marked advantages  in convenience  and speed over  ships.  The continuance of these lines cannot, unfortunately,  be taken as  an indication that  they are all financially successful.  77. Air lines have been free to develop as they chose, and the rate of progress up  to  1935 would appear at first sight to have been satisfactory despite the fact that some lines have had a brief existence and many  were reconstructed, some more than once.   In  1936, however, there  was a decrease in  the route mileage, increased com- petition and nearly all the air line companies admit that they are working at  a loss.  From the information before us it appears that the load factors on  most of the internal air services are  considerably less  than 50 per cent., which  indicates that they have either not met the public demand or that an effective demand does not exist on the routes operated.B. Requirements for successful Air Services  78. To be successful, air lines must offer services :       (i) Fast and frequent  enough to show a  substantial saving    in time over alternative methods  of travel and at a reasonable    cost.      (ii) At convenient hours.      (iii) As regular and punctual as alternative means of travel.  79. (i) Saving in time. Up to the present this has been achievedto the greatest extent in services which cross water, and in the North
of Scotland.  Services  to  the south-west of England also show aconsiderable saving of time, but the alternative train services are more frequent.   Generally speaking,  the longer  air journeys  of  about250 miles in length effect a satisfactory saving in time, except wheremany intermediate stops are made or where  they are in competition with the fastest train services.  The frequency of the train service in this group is, however, very much greater.  Where the train service is fast  and frequent, air travel over landmay offer only a small advantage for distances of about  200 milesor in some cases over even  greater distances.   When alternativetravel  is wholly  or  partly by ship, which may also involve  delaydue  to changes in method of transport,  air services can offer anundoubted superiority both in speed and frequency.  80. (ii) Convenience of hours. One advantage which air  travelmay be able to offer in  the case of certain of the longer routes is the elimination of travel during normal  business hours by  making it possible to reach a distant centre, transact business there, and return in one day.  An evening air service may also obviate the necessityfor sleeping in the train. But so long as air line operators are unableto fly regularly during the hours of darkness their power to provideservices offering these advantages  is strictly limited,   (cf. appendix ii.)  81. (iii)  Regularity and punctuality. We note  that  whilst in summer fairly high regularity was maintained,  in  winter severalservices operated in the North of England were only able to completeabout 60 per cent, of the scheduled  flights.  Even when air services are quicker than surface  transport a reasonably high standard ofregularity  is necessary to gain  public support; it becomes lessnecessary  only  when  surface communications are  also  irregular,as for  instance  in outlying parts  of Great Britain where steamersmay be held up by adverse weather.  82. We have not included all-the-year-round continuity of service as a specific condition  of successful operation&apos; since the data at our disposal are insufficient to show  whether purely seasonal services can be made to pay. The heavy standing charges which have to bemet when  aircraft are idle do, however, suggest that continuity fora considerable part of the year is necessary for economical operation.An uninterrupted service will accustom the public to rank air travelwith other v^ell  established forms  of transport.C. Speed of Air Travel   83. As the principal advantage of air travel is speed, it is necessaryto  consider what internal air services can offer in that respect.We have already shown that on short journeys the air shows little,if any, advantage in speed over the railway.   It is only on longerjourneys that the air is appreciably faster.   The following examplestaken  from current time-tables  show comparisons  on  journeys  ofabout  100, 200, 300 and 400 miles.  It is unfortunate that there are
	Air.				* Surface.				Miles.	Time.	Average Speed (m.p.h.).		Average Speed (m.p.h.).	Time.

Note. The distances by air are measured between town centres and notbetween aerodromes ;  the  distances and times by rail are taken from therailway time tables for October, 1936.  84.  In estimating the speed of air travel, allowance must be madefor  the improving performance of aircraft.   We are told that areasonable operating speed for commercial aircraft in this country inthe  near future will be 160 miles per hour and we take that figure asa basis.   To define the speed of an air journey measured between two centres, we have made the following average allowance, basedon existing experience :                                                Minutes.      To and from airports, 20 minutes each way     40      Loading and off loading, 5 minutes each  ..    10      Aircraft manoeuvres, allow 15 minutes   ..    15                               Total   ..      lhr. 5mins.  It must be noted that, where the point of departure or arrival is from or to a London aerodrome, a further 20 minutes must be addedto the time needed for the journey between town centre and aerordrome.  Moreover, where  an intermediate stop is made on the airjourney, it is necessary to  allow 15 minutes for aircraft manoeuvresand at least 5 minutes for off and on loading, making 20 minutesin all.no long distance air services enabling exact comparison to be madewith rail journeys.  The fastest route by surface transport between london and Belfast is via Stranraer and the distance covered is470 miles as against 313 by air.  The slower but more direct route by rail and ship is 377 miles long.  Again, the air service between london and Glasgow flies via Belfast.  To afford a fair comparisonit would be necessary to show a  direct air service, which does not exist.
  By allowing for these estimated delays we arrived at the followingpotential overall speeds on direct air journeys :        100 miles- 60 miles per hour.       200 miles- 85 miles per hour.       300 miles-100 miles per hour.       400 miles-110 miles per hour.  85. If on any part of the route the alternative method of travelis by ship, averaging overall not more than say 20 miles per hour, itis evident  that the*air journey can effect a considerable  saving oftime.  Where, however, the comparison throughout is with the trainaveraging  up to 60 m.p.h. or even more, the  air.journey  is at a comparative disadvantage at  distances of 100 miles  or even more.There  is  evidence  that in all  important countries in the worldconsiderable efforts are being  made to increase  the speed  of trains.A chart, illustrating  this, compiled from the figures given in theRailway Gazette, will be found in Appendix VII.D.  Public demand for Air Travel  86. We have examined the extent to which existing air servicesappear to be meeting demands for air travel, and we have suggested the main requirements for operation without which the public willnot be attracted to travel by air.  We have now to see what evidencethere is of the existence of a public demand for air travel in theUnited Kingdom.  87. There can be no doubt that the greater convenience and speedoffered by air services flying over water have found a public anxiousand willing to use them.  The traffic on these routes is, however, to agreat extent seasonal, having marked peak  loads, and there  is acomparatively small amount of commercial traffic requiring travel facilities throughout the year.  88. Apart from exceptional routes of this kind, the extent to which one  method of transport can  economicaUy and in  practice besubstituted for another is limited.  Out of the total traffic offeringbetween two points, only a small proportion will demand the higherspeed which air travel can offer or be  able to bear its cost.   Thatproportion  is likely  to  be highest between those  centres  wherepopulation is greatest, but it is precisely between, those centres thatthe  facilities offered by surface transport are already highly developed.  Over short distances where surface communications  are fast andfrequent, an air line can offer little saving in time.  On cross-countryjourneys where the air line could offer greater advantages in time,no strong demand for fast travel seems to exist, if we may judgefrom the frequency and speed of surface facilities  and perhaps thepaucity of traffic is inherent in the present conditions.  It is on routes connecting the principal manufacturing and tradingcentres that demand  for speed is at once  most evident and that asufficient volume of travellers  veiling to use the air will most readily
be found, and where such routes are sufficiently long, the air line should find remunerative business in providing transport at highspeed.  S9. If such appear  to  be the limitations upon the commercialuse of the air under present conditions, we see in them no reasonfor discouragement.  Our observations have been directed to theposition as it exists to-day.  We are  far indeed from advancing theview that the potential development  of air travel in these islands islikely to  be limited by such considerations.  Technical advancesand an increasing air-mindedness on the part of the rising generationmay  well bring  about a  change  in the  situation.  It  is also acommonly accepted axiom that &quot; traffic begets traffic &quot;,  and while we have referred to air travel in competitive terms with surface trans-port,  there is some evidence to show that increased and improvedfacilities for travel in themselves create fresh custom which, linked with the growing habit of mobility on the part  of the population,may well give a marked impetus to aviation in the years ahead.E. Where Air Routes will be  90. In paragraph 60 we referred to the request from the AerodromeOwners&apos; Association for guidance as to where the main internal air routes of  this  country will  be  established.  It  is  evident  that a precise forecast is impossible as  data  to indicate potential traffic donot exist, and conjecture must enter very largely into any estimates in terms of existing traffic.  Moreover the term &quot; main route &quot; maytend to mislead unless it is understood only to mean the routes alongwhich the greatest amount of traffic is likely to be carried.  A mainline is generally conceived to be  one carrying traffic of a volume andspeed which calls for a quality and complexity of ground equipment in excess  of that required for  other kinds of routes.  While  thiscriterion may be  applicable to other parts  of the world, it is not soto air lines flying over the small and densely populated area of theBritish Isles.  Radio assistance and  air traffic control are planned and organised by areas and give assistance to all traffic crossing those -areas.  Aerodromes serving regular commercial traffic must be of a standard size irrespective of the volume of that traffic.  Consequently,except possibly in outlying parts of the British Isles, the equipmentlikely to be required for regular air services will probably not differgreatly between one route and  another.  91.  Further experience  is needed before  an  adequate picture ofthe future regular air lines in these islands  can be drawn, but it ispossible in the light of present  knowledge to suggest lines  alongwhich there is the best promise of sound development.   The develop-ment  should be over selected routes as part of a well  consideredscheme which can be expanded to meet the needs  of the future.  Ifthe uncertainty which  characterises air operation in this country isto be overcome, we think that it will be necessary to concentrate ona few of the most promising routes, and that successful operations
on these routes alone will provide the basis of confidence necessaryfor sound development.  In Part III, Paragraph 127, we make our recommendations accordingly.F. The Provision of Aerodromes and the Reservation of A erodrome Sites  92. The desire of the Aerodrome Owners for guidance concerningfuture lines of air travel in this country is due to the fact that, while some municipalities  already own aerodromes, others are still con-sidering their provision and hesitate to take action until they know the extent to  which these  aerodromes are likely to be used in thefuture.  93. We have given much consideration  to this subject and have come to the conclusion that the time is not distant when an aerodromeought as a matter of course, to be available to every  large centre of population.  Such aerodromes should be large enough to meet theneeds of regular commercial air traffic,  otherwise their use will be restricted to fair  weather flying.  Centres which fail to- acquire orreserve  an aerodrome site may be depriving their populations of facilities for flying, since the rate  at which  building developmentnear populous centres is taking place makes it increasingly difficultto secure a suitable site for an aerodrome near enough to the centre of industry to make  it easily accessible.  We have already shownhow  the usefulness of aerodromes depends upon quick access fromthe regions they serve.   Close co-operation between surface and air transport would enable a standard commercial aerodrome to serve a wide  area and in suitable  circumstances  a number of adjacentcommunities could economically combine to provide and operate ajoint aerodrome.  94. Whilst some of  the large cities  and towns have providedaerodromes, a more active interest might well be taken by the CountyAuthorities.  This apparent lack of interest is not surprising whenit is remembered that important air routes have tended to originateand  terminate in or near large centres of population.  But theinaction of the counties is none the less regrettable, because it is often impossible to secure suitable aerodrome sites elsewhere than in county areas.  County  administration  is  thus affected, especiallyin regard to highways and county planning.   The population of theCounty districts  has an equal interest in this  matter with thepopulation of the towns.  It therefore appears to us on all grounds that the closest co-operation between the County,  County borough councils and other large Urban Councils is essential.  The machineryfor this already exists,  in the shape of many Joint Planning  Com-mittees upon  which  the County and interested County borough councils  are  associated with respresentatives of  all  appropriate authorities having official status in the county area.   In some casesthe activities of these bodies have been  effective in helping forwardCivil Aviation.  We  would urge that more activity in this spherewould be attended with good results.
                              29  95.  The reservationjof a suitable site may well be wise  policy,even where the possibilities of internal air services have not yet fullydemonstrated that the  expenditure on a standard commercial aero-drome is justified.  Nor is the site likely to remain unused.  There areactivities in aviation other than air lines and, in our opinion,  thelocal  authority which  gives  opportunities to the members  of itscommunity to take a  practical part  in flying is fulfilling a dutycommensurate in importance with many of the other services whichit does not hesitate to provide.  The recent  developments in  themanufacture  of  very light planes indicate that opportunities of lying may become much more widely available.  96.  On the  experience  so  far obtained, the  average  cost of  a standard commercial aerodrome may be estimated at about  125,000.To  this figure, however, an  addition  which  cannot be  estimatedmay have to be made for compensation.  It will be rememberedthat, subject  to  a claim to compensation from interests  affected,aerodrome owners may, under the Air Navigation Act, 1936, light attheir own expense obstructions on the air approaches to aerodromes and that, under the Town  Planning Act, local authorities may limit the right of landowners  to raise obstructions which, whether lightedor not, may be dangerous to air traffic.  97.  We are  of opinion that,  to secure the  regular  and  punctualoperation  of  modern  commercial aircraft,  aerodromes   are  now necessary of the maximum dimensions recommended by the  AirMinistry  (paragraph  52).   Those  dimensions accord  with  recentpractice abroad,  and while for special  purposes, such as long rangeflights, still larger aerodromes may be required, we think that suchan aerodrome as is described in Appendix III may now be taken asthe  standard for commercial use and that it will be for the aircraftconstructor to build  to that  standard or incur  the risk  of  havingonly a limited use for his product.  98.  If regular  operation is to be  maintained, the technical equip-ment  at all standard commercial  aerodromes should be identical,irrespective of their situation or the volume of the traffic using them.Only the amount of accommodation required for passengers, goods and mail is dependent on the extent to which the aerodrome is used.  99.  We have given consideration mainly to the requirements ofthe  types of aircraft in common commercial use at the present day.Other types of aircraft may possibly call for less extensive aerodromes,but  we are informed that  no aircraft of unconventional design has yet  reached a stage  of development  which fits it for commercialoperation and until this happens the method of its employment canonly be conjectured.  There may, however, be  some air lines which can afford to operate with ground facilities of a more restricted order.  These are linesnot  requiring to maintain a  high  degree of regularity to compete
successfully with alternative means of transport and they are foundin  outlying  parts  of Great  Britain.  Again,  technical or  otherdevelopments increasing economy of air line operation may enableseasonal services carrying holiday passengers to earn profits.  such services  operating in the  more favourable conditions of Summermay be able to maintain sufficient regularity without having recourse to  all-weather aerodromes of standard size.  Smaller aerodromesalso suffice for Club and  Private flying.G.  Should Aerodromes be Subsidised?  100. We have referred in paragraph  59 to the suggestion of the aerodrome  Owners Association that the  State should contribute towards the cost of aerodromes a sum equivalent to the annual lossesincurred during their development period.   We would  observe that,as  municipal  aerodromes  have  only been in existence for a very short time, it is much too early to attempt to draw conclusions fromthe returns obtained  up to the present.   (The dates  on which 30municipal aerodromes were licensed for the first time will be foundin  Appendix  VIII.)  When municipalities were being pressed toprovide  aerodromes, it was urged and, we understand, generally accepted that receipts would be negligible for some years.  It wasalso urged that they should  be looked upon  as a service to  thecommunity rather than as a source of profit and with this view weconcur.  It was given in evidence that  although returns have been small, there had been capital appreciation in most cases and it was realised that the future prosperity of a town might be gravely affectedby  the lack of an aerodrome.  Although it would be  unreasonable to expect aerodromes to be a source of profit  at the present time,we  are satisfied that those authorities establishing them are investingin something which will not fail to  be beneficial to the communitiesthey serve.  101. The desire of local authorities to justify their expenditure on aerodromes by obtaining revenue  at the earliest possible momenthas led  in  some cases  to undesirable  competition.  In order to attract traffic, more and more advantageous terms have been offered to aircraft owners, until some aerodromes are now charging little or nothing for the services they are giving.  We think it is desirable  that, as a first step, aerodrome ownersshould agree on  a minimum scale of charges to be put  in force at all their aerodromes.  Secondly, we think that some owners might givecloser  study to  the application of  commercial  methods  to  themanagement of  their  aerodromes ;  if customers are to be obtainedthey must be informed of the services which are available.  102. We believe that  aviation at home is an activity beneficial to the community and worthy  of support during its early periodof development.  The Government is already  assisting civil flying in the United Kingdom,  both in the subsidy granted to flying clubsand in the  ground organisation which  makes  possible the present
internal air services.  It undertakes also the work of licensing andcontrol, and, if our recommendations are  accepted, it will extend its  help  and  commitments  considerably.  All   these  activitiesstimulate traffic from which  aerodromes can derive revenue.  It ishere we  think that a proper  distinction  can be  drawn  betweennational  and local  interests.  Where civil aviation can serve andthus benefit a locality, it is in the interest of the local authorities tomake such provision as will enable the inhabitants of that localityto derive the fullest advantages from flying.  We do not, therefore,recommend any state subsidy to civil aerodromes.H.  Co-ordination of Air and Surface  Travel  103. Co-ordination  between aviation and surface transport will,in our opinion, become increasingly important, particularly in viewof the comparatively short distances in these islands and the densityof their communications.  It would be wrong to discuss air transport and surface transport in terms of pure competition, and  the trueapproach, if both are to benefit and the community is to  gain thegreatest advantage  from the potentialities of the air, is to regard them  as  complementary.  It would not be in the public  interest,nor would public opinion tolerate, that competitive or alternative forms of transport  should enter the field  of  commercial aviation,not with  the intention of developing flying  services but in the hopeof stifling them or restricting and delaying their development.  Anysuch attempt is perhaps unlikely and certainly we see no signs of it.On  the other hand much waste and avoidable expenditure of money in unnecessary rivalry  can be entailed if those interested  in  airdevelopment fail to realise that  the  maximum of economy  andadvantage can be secured only if all the transport interests concerned are  working together in harmony.  104. The recent history of commercial operation in  this country has presented a kaleidoscope  of different and competing companies,some of them very  short lived  and most, if not all of them, losingmoney.   The result has been a tendency  to amalgamation.  Themost important group so formed became known as  British  AirwaysLtd.   The  railway  companies  in  conjunction  with  imperial airways Ltd. have formed an airline company known as Railway air services Ltd.  These two are the largest groups operating within thecountry, and there are also several other companies, some of whichhave working and financial connections with the two main groups.  105. The  advantages to be  derived  from, the close association between the railways and air travel are exemplified by some of thefacilities  provided in connection with Railway Air  Services  and allied companies.  Ample booking facilities can be afforded.  Ticketsavailable for rail or air  or both can be offered.  Baggage  arrange-ments can be simplified.  Terminal connections can be provided.  106. Initial losses on services of a pioneer character are to beexpected, but it is our considered view that any state of affairs in
which the various parties conducted their enterprises on the principleof the longest purse winning would prove expensive to them andinimical to  the  future of civil aviation.  We would urge stronglytherefore that some further merging of interests should be consideredby the  principal companies and that an all-round effort to secureco-ordination between air and surface travel should be made.  Weadvance some further proposals directed to this end in Part III ofour Report.   107. We have had submitted to us by Mr. Bennie of Glasgow ascheme for overhead railways which he claims, if put into operation,would give expeditious travel between town terminals and airports.His  suggestions, if they were proved to  be  commercially feasible,might no doubt form a useful adjunct to air  transport, but theerection of  a new  overhead structure,  which apparently must be between 30  and 40 feet in height,  over the railway lines radiatingfrom the centre of our  cities, including London,  must obviouslyraise questions  of a technical character, or affecting amenity, withwhich we cannot deal and which, before the necessary powers were granted, would presumably have to be examined by Parliament.I. London Aerodromes   108. During the course of our deliberations proposals were madefor a commercial aerodrome to the  East of London, near Ilford.  Wewere able to advise that, in our view, the need for such an aerodromemust arise and understand that the  Corporation of the City of Londonwill  purchase this site.  Road access to it is good and we are assured that new facilities now being provided in this district by the london passenger Transport Board will give speedy means of tube travel to the City and the centre of London.   109. We are  glad also to learn that there is the prospect of theconstruction of a large commercial aerodrome to the South East ofLondon at a point which can be well served by rail.   110. Communications to  Croydon are  unfortunately  not easilyimproved.  We are informed that the provision of a rail connectionto the aerodrome would be costly and the rail traffic to the centre ofLondon is so dense that the Southern Railway could not without difficulty give sufficiently  frequent services to connect  with the numerous arrivals and departures at the airport.   111. Gatwick  relies entirely  upon  the Southern Railway for communications to London.  The  arrangements for passengers areconvenient, and  accessibility is as good as that of any other london airport.  Both Gatwick and Gravesend serve as relief aerodromes toCroydon under a 15 years&apos; agreement made between the Air ministry and  the owners.   112. Consideration is at present  being given to the retention ofHeston  as an aerodrome of dimensions sufficient  to  meet  futureneeds.  While negotiations to this end are in progress we are unableto comment on the future of this  aerodrome.
                                                              13   113.  An aerodrome site has  been recently approved at Sloughalthough its development into an airport of standard dimensions isnot yet assured.  There is also a proposal to construct a commercialaerodrome on the North West of London.  This site is not at presentserved by rail but can be reached by road in  approximately 40minutes.  114. If these  schemes mature  there will be  seven  aerodromesserving  London.   Owing  to  the  technical. restrictions at  presentgoverning the siting of &quot;standard.&quot; aerodromes and the necessityfor fast surface  communications,  it appears that the area to theNorth is the only one in which a further site could be located.  It isimpossible to forecast  the requirements of the distant  future but,whatever they may be, it seems to us prudent to insure against thepossibility of the Greater London area with its  population of tenmillion  being deprived of  adequate  facilities  for  air  transport.Owing to rapid building development it is urgent  to ensure that thefuture of existing aerodromes  and sites, wherever suitable, is safe-guarded.  We think, therefore, that steps should be taken forthwith to discover  and secure  a suitable site for a &quot; standard &quot;  aerodrometo the North of London.   115.  Suggestions have been made for siting an aerodrome in thecentre of London.  No single central aerodrome can handle the wholeof London&apos;s  air traffic,  while the  dimensions  of a &quot; standard&quot;aerodrome which are necessary for safety are such as to  make thesuggestion of roof  aerodromes unattractive for types of  aircraft  atpresent in use.   There  appears to be no alternative  but to develop the main aerodromes on suitable sites in a belt around London.   Itwill be important to secure the most rapid surface communicationspossible.   116.  We have considered proposals for unified ownership  of allaerodromes serving London but the advantages of such a scheme arenot apparent at the moment  and it is too early to make recom-mendations on this point until further experience is available./. Air Line Pilots  117. A considerable  amount of training is needed to ensure thatpilots possess the requisite skill and experience to make proper useof the control and  navigational facilities necessary for safe flying inall weathers by day or night.  118. We were  informed (paragraph 29) that there is a shortage of qualified air line pilots.  The problem of  making good the presentshortage, and of raising the standard of efficiency, is one which it willbe difficult  for the air  line  companies to solve as the cost must be considerable.  We  understand that the Air Council are taking stepsto equip short-service  pilots with experience that  will  better  fitthem  for civil aviation work.   Some time must necessarily elapse before these measures will become fully effective.
  119. A pilot, before he is entitled to fly aircraft carrying passengersfor  hire  or reward, has  to  be the holder of a  commercial pilofslicence, usually called a &quot; B &quot; licence.  But we understand that the qualifications at present necessary to obtain this licence do not fullyequip a pilot to fly on air lines in the conditions which we advocate.At  present most  air line operators require  their pilots to possessflying experience  considerably in excess of that  required  to obtain a &quot; B &quot; licence.  Rather  than recommend any change in the &quot; B &quot;licence requirements, we think that the institution of a  separate and additional licence for air transport work is desirable.
                          PART HI         CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS            I. PRIVATE FLYING  AND FLYING CLUBS  120. The assistance which the Government has given to the flyingclubs has been successful in  creating interest in aviation.  We  are advised that the developments now taking place to make the flyingof light aircraft less costly are likely to bring it within the means of agreater number of users. The aerodrome facilities necessary are lessextensive and less costly than those required for the operation ofcommercial air lines and we would urge  local authorities to make provision so that those who wish may obtain practical experience of lying and become familiar with this new and expeditious form oftransport. It should not be regarded as a sport only but should beused and  encouraged  as a means of making our population air-minded.  121. We recommend that, in the review of the subsidy arrange-ments which is due to take place in 1937, full weight should be givento the valuable results which have been achieved by its aid.         II. AERIAL DISPLAYS AND PLEASURE FLIGHTS  122. Displays have undoubtedly played their part in the develop-ment  of  aviation but we are inclined to  think that the type ofspectacular display which has been offered in the past  could with advantage be replaced by displays designed to bring home the more practical applications of flying.  In particular, we would recommendthat aerodrome owners should endeavour to popularise flying by the encouragement, wherever traffic conditions permit, of short pleasureflights  designed  to  familiarise  the population  with  air  travel.Combined with these  steps, the possibilities of utilising the localaerodrome as a centre  of  attraction and  recreation  will doubtlessnot escape the attention of local authorities.                     III. SPECIAL  CHARTER  123. We have no  specific  recommendations to  make  beyondsuggesting that increased publicity for the facilities available might prove advantageous not only to the firms concerned but also in come degree to aerodrome owners.              IV. SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL FLYING  124. Conditions under which air lines in the United Kingdom havehitherto been flown do not show whether it would be possible undersuitable operating conditions to run them at a profit, but, so long aswasteful competition continues and services are unduly limited intheir frequency,  regularity and convenience, it  seems unlikely that air transport will pay  its way.
  We have expressed in paragraph 78 the general conditions, whichwe  consider should govern the  operation of internal services  and,given those conditions, we are of opinion that,  on suitable routes and under good management, it is not only possible but highlyprobable that air services can be made financially successful.  125. We are, however, forced to the conclusion that if air transport is to become fully self-supporting, it is a pre-requisite that  cut-throatcompetition must be eliminated and that some measure of  restrictionmust be applied to avoid indiscriminate multiplication of services.This has been the experience in almost  every field of transport, andwe  note that Parliament has recognised, in  the Air Navigation Act,1936, that the need for regulation of the air may arise and has made provision for the licensing of air transport.  126. We recommend accordingly that there should be a provisionalregulation of selected routes  with a view to ensuring that  suitableconditions are secured for the experimental operation of air services in such a way that they will be given the maximum opportunity tobecome self-supporting  and thus supply that background of confi-dence which is at present lacking.  The conduct of the experimentshould be sufficiently flexible to allow for future developments andto enable the fullest advantage to be taken of the experience gained.A. Junction  Aerodrome  System  127. We have considered how such an experiment could be madeon a sufficiently large scale to provide valuable experience  and yetwith the smallest possible outlay of money.  An all-the-year-round demand  for fast transport  is most likelyto exist between important industrial and commercial areas, and  airtravel will offer  a more substantial saving of time between ares which are far  apart.   Business interests will  further require  airconnections with the rest of the  world.   To meet such requirements in the United Kingdom it appears obvious  that routes should joinBelfast,  Glasgow-Edinburgh,  Newcastle,  London,  Southampton-Portsmouth and  Bristol.  The total route-mileage of such a service would be 2,900 miles(see Appendix IX).  128. If frequent services were  offered over this network, it wouldprobably be some time before the requisite load factors were obtained and the experiment would therefore be costly.   At a small  sacrifice of speed it is possible to give an  equivalent service by joining the selected areas to a central junction aerodrome, thus reducing the route mileage from 2,900 to 960 miles.  Services  to and from the terminal areas would connect at the junction (which might well hesituated in the Manchester-Liverpool area) as nearly simultaneouslyas is operationally possible, and such a system  would serve  an aggregate population of 14 millions or about one-third of the  total population of the United Kingdom.
  129.  This should produce high  load  factors because an aircraftflying to the junction on any route might carry loads destined forthree areas and on its return trip might carry loads from these areas.If fourteen-seater aircraft were employed and each aircraft carriedthree people for each of three destinations the load factor  would reach 64 per cent., which might  permit fares as low  as 3Jd  perpassenger mile to be charged.  In addition, direct non-stop services could be run wherever a sufficient demand existed.  130.  Apart from  mail requirements,  to which we refer later, a schedule of four round trips a day over the system described wouldrequire sixteen aircraft, all fourteen-seaters of one  type and eachflying some 1,500 hours per year.  A central repair and maintenanceorganisation could  be  set  up and this would effect considerableeconomies.  131.  The termini proposed offer communications  to  Continentaland Empire air routes and provide opportunities for other internalservices to connect with the system. The termini are not planned toserve towns only  but  areas from which traffic might be drawn bymeans of either air or surface connections.  132.  This Junction  Aerodrome System is the scheme which webelieve  to  be  best  calculated to  secure  the  greatest  measure ofadvantage both in facilities to the travelling public and in economicaloperation and with a view to determining its practical value werecommend that it  should be given an experimental trial for fiveyears under suitable operation.B. Licensing  of Regular  Services  133.  In order to ensure the conditions necessary for the operationof the  junction aerodrome scheme, or  indeed for the  satisfactoryoperation of any other services connecting the towns embraced in thescheme, we deem it  essential that the operation of regular passenger services on these  routes,  as distinct from occasional charter  nightslimited to a few passengers, should be secured by means of a licence to a single company or to a  combination working  on the closestterms of co-ordination.  This  licence  should be limited in the firstinstance to a term  of five  years, renewable thereafter  for suitableperiods if satisfactory performance has  been given.  134.  We  recognise that there may be difficulties at the outset in selecting the most suitable agency to operate the junction aerodromeservice, and we therefore recommend that a licensing authority shouldbe appointed for  this purpose which  would take  into account  theposition of all operating companies in active existence who are nowconducting, or have for a substantial period within the last threeyears conducted, regular and satisfactory services  over  any sectionor sections of the route concerned.  It is our hope, however, that thecompanies eligible&apos; will combine in a single working unit to operate the  scheme, thereby  securing the maximum economies  and  thecorrelation of surface and transport interests.
  135. In regard to other internal routes not embraced in the scheme,we think that a system of licensing of all regular passenger services should be  introduced with a view to  ensuring the most effectiveservice  to the public, while avoiding uneconomical  overlapping.We do not think, however, that such licences should necessarily beexclusive  over these  routes provided that  satisfactory service andco-ordination were secured.C. Ground Organisation Required  136. We are fortified in our recommendations for the introductionof a licensing  system by  our conviction  that,  if any satisfactory progress is to  be made, it  is essential that ground services must beprovided on a considerably enhanced scale.  137. Already the air is becoming congested over certain areas andthe grave risk of collision in the  absence of proper control has led us,in the course of our enquiry, to recommend that special steps shouldbe taken,  without waiting  for the issue of this Report, to impose ormaintain suitable control  in the dangerous  areas.   It is clear alsothat if the conditions necessary to secure a real advance  in internalflying are to be satisfied, there will need to be considerable extensions of night flying installations and  wireless apparatus to assist landingsin conditions of bad visibility.  138. The expenses  of  this  additional  ground organisation  arelikely to impose an appreciable extra  burden on the public pursefor a considerable period.  If the public is to foot this bill for the timebeing,  it  is only reasonable  that it should be  satisfied that  fullmeasures  are taken to ensure such conditions in commercial flyingas will make  it self-supporting  as early  as possible, through  thepayment  of registration  or  other  fees,  just  as the  mercantilemarine meets, through its  payment of dues,  the cost of safeguardingnavigation.  139.  (i)  Route Equipment.   The  machinery   of  radio guidance and  control has  already  been described  in  Part I  (paragraphs30-42) and we recommend that this should be fully developed in anelastic system organised in areas,  so  that  seasonal and changingdemands  of traffic can  be met without expensive  alterations inground services.   The  ground organisation proposed should  notonly fulfil the requirements of the experimental junction aerodromesystem, but also  afford  protection for other services which mayconnect  with  it  or  operate independently in  any  of  the radioareas.  140. We recommend that freedom of flight for aircraft withoutradio should be maintained as far as possible but that, in the interestsof safety,  certain height layers and zones  should be reserved forradio controlled aircraft until such time as  technical developmentsmay make this unnecessary.

(i)  Route Equipment.  The machinery  of radio  guidance and control has  already  been  described   in Part  I (paragraphs30-42) and we recommend that this should be fully developed in anelastic system organised  in areas, so that seasonal and  changingdemands  of traffic can be met  without expensive  alterations inground services.   The ground organisation proposed should notonly fulfil the requirements of the experimental junction aerodromesystem, but also  afford  protection for other services which  mayconnect  with  it  or  operate independently in any  of the  radioareas.   140. We  recommend that freedom  of flight for aircraft withoutradio should be maintained as far as possible but that, in the interestsof safety, certain height  layers  and zones should be reserved forradio controlled aircraft until such time as technical  developmentsmay make this unnecessary.
  141. In the past, certain aerodrome proprietors have contributedtowards the  cost  of  radio stations situated  on their  aerodromesthough the services given by a station were not confined to aircraftarriving at or departing from the aerodrome at which the radio was established.  Existing radio  stations at present assist  Royal AirForce aircraft from time to time and it is  clear that traffic controlmust to some extent be extended to cover Royal Air Force aircraft,in both Service and  civil interests.  It is important  also that control should be impartially exercisedand be divorced from any commercial interests connected with air-port or aircraft operation ; and as the power to control will have tobe exercised with authority recognised and accepted by all concerned,it seems to us  that there is  a strong case for relieving  aerodromeproprietors of any part of the expense connected with this controland of vesting it in a central body.  142. Apart from the fact that there exists  no suitable  body towhich this work could be entrusted, the probability is that for sometime, at any rate, there would  be no direct  source of revenue tocover the cost and thus the necessary finances at the outset  wouldrequire  to be  furnished by the  Government.  We  recommend,therefore,  that all radio facilities and a comprehensive air  traffic control organisation adequate to ensure the safety and regularity ofair communication at all times  in  the United Kingdom should beprovided,  maintained and operated  by  the Government.  Thisshould be combined with the meteorological organisation immediately concerned with internal flying.  The capital cost of carrying out these recommendations is anti-cipated to be  about   320,000  and  the total annual  cost  about 240,000, of which about  40,000 per annum is already being incurredor in prospect.  The whole  cost of  the Meteorological Service  isalready borne by  the Government.  143. In  putting forward  these  recommendations we recognisethat the  State would thus be making a substantial  additional contribution  to  the development of aviation  in this country.  Wehave deliberately  selected this rather than the method  of subsidyas a means of assisting in the initial stages, since we trust that  inthe course  of time it will prove possible for the burden to be trans-ferred to aviation  itself through the medium of registration fees  or some similar  device.  144. (ii)  Aerodrome Equipment.  We have recommended  that theState should provide equipment,  including  all  ground radio, topermit aircraft to  navigate in safety from one aerodrome to another in all normal conditions, but further measures remain to be taken before aircraft  can use those aerodromes without  danger  at  night and in conditions of bad visibility.
  145. We recommend that  the  responsibility  for  taking these measures should be that of aerodrome proprietors and we trust thatthey will provide the necessary devices other than radio at the aero-dromes used by regular  services.  Such  provision will of- courseenhance the value of the aerodromes so equipped and we hope that itwill result in increased revenue to the aerodromes and assist towardsmaking them eventually self-supporting.  146. (Hi) Aerodromes, Ownership and Location.  In Paragraph 29C,it  was mentioned that the air line  operators  in their evidencestated that aerodromes  owned by  some  air line  operators  areonly made available to other operators on unfavourable conditions,and  the  opinion  was  expressed  that  the  ownership  of aero-dromes by persons or companies financially interested in air  lineoperations is in many ways undesirable.   In view of the fact that ina mtmber of localities it is probable that no aerodromes would existbut for the steps taken by air operators themselves to provide them,we do not think it would be reasonable to displace them from owner-ship or to exclude the  establishment  of aerodromes  by privateenterprise.  At  the same  time the possibility of private ownershipbeing used for the purpose of securing a monopoly of service is an obvious danger  and clearly points  to the desirability of the mainaerodromes being in the ownership  of local authorities or statutorybodies.   147. In accordance with our  observations in paragraph  101 werecommend that there should  be standard  scales of  aerodromecharges in operation throughout the country and that all owners of aerodromes licensed for public use should be required to conform to these scales.   148. Our general views  as to the joint provision of aerodromes inall considerable centres of population are stated  in paragraph 93,and we can sum up our conclusions in that respect by recommending that the  local  authorities in  all the larger towns and centres of population should take early steps to see that a suitable and readilyaccessible site for ah aerodrome of the standard dimensions is securedfor their citizens.  Localities which by  reason of their  situation orsmaller population are unlikely  to require the operation of regularservices would do well to provide for aerodromes of somewhat smallersize, though capable  of as much expansion as their circumstances permit, to cater for the future needs of private flying and such specialor occasional commercial  services as may develop.   149. In particular we would draw attention to the urgent need forthe provision of adequate standard size aerodromes at the central and terminal points indicated on the map  of the junction airportscheme in Appendix X.  Speke aerodrome,  Liverpool, is alreadylarge enough and it appears probable that the new Ringway aero-drome at Manchester can be suitably developed.   Both Bristol andNewcastle aerodromes can be readily  extended and it is understood
that the Belfast Harbour Commissioners are rapidly developing the aerodrome adjoining Belfast.  Extensions  and improvements  are needed at Southampton and Portsmouth to  secure their full partici-pation in the scheme, and there is  an urgent  necessity  for  theprovision of a suitable aerodrome in Scotland to serve edinburgh and  Glasgow.   London presents  a special problem which we have discussed in paragraphs  108 et seq. and which we understand  theAir Ministry has under close consideration at the present moment,D. Carriage of Mail  150. It is evident that as the great bulk of inland mail is postedtowards  the end of the day,  there  is only limited  scope for  thedevelopment  of inland mail conveyance by air so long as regularnight flying is impracticable.  151. The question of  the  extent to  which advantage might betaken by the Post Office of an extensive system of night flying hasbeen  closely examined  by  an  expert departmental  Committeeappointed by  the Postmaster  General.  This Committee came tothe conclusion that, owing to the geographical characteristics of  thiscountry  and  the excellent  railway facilities which it enjoys,  thescope for large-scale improvements  in the  postal service throughthe utilisation of the air was inevitably limited.  It was  apparent, however, that if  suitable air services, frying at night and interlocking with the  system of  Travelling Post  Officeswhich forms the  framework of the main postal  services, could be envisaged, material improvements could be effected in the overnighttransport times  of  mails exchanged between  the  more remotedistricts, and the ideal of a country-wide breakfast-table delivery of correspondence posted up to the close of the working  day could bemore closely achieved.  152. The organisation  of air services connecting with  the systemof Travelling  Post Offices has for the  moment certain practicaldifficulties ;  and the most feasible  step at  present  would be toestablish certain direct services between large towns only.  We have consulted the Post Office Authorities as to the direction in whichthe night flying facilities which would be provided on the junctionaerodrome system could  best be utilised so as to secure acceleration of postal traffic and we understand that the following services wouldbe advantageous.Depart.Arrive.   Dailyapproximate  weight.2. Belfast-london.

  153. At a subsequent stage we think that connecting services fromsuitable terminal air ports on the junction scheme should be con-sidered for mail purposes.   It will also be for future consideration whether  further useful postal  improvement  could be effected bylinking up Crewe  at night and thus securing connection with the travelling Post  Office  System which radiates from that centre.  Itis  questionable,  however, whether the provision of an aerodromewith the necessary facilities at Crewe could be justified on economic grounds if it were to be provided solely or mainly for postal purposes.  154. For the present,  we consider that it would be advisable to commence experimentally with the night  mail services  indicated above and we are of the opinion that such services might suitably beentrusted to the  organisation operating  the junction aerodromeservice.  This course would afford fuller employment  for the aircraft of that organisation.   155. We  recommend  therefore   with  the concurrence  of  thePostmaster General that, subject to the arrangement of satisfactoryterms, the mail contract should be allotted to the organisation chosen to  operate  the  junction aerodrome  service for  the term  of  itslicence.E. Training of Air Line Pilots   156. In  order to meet the present shortage  in trained air linepilots referred to  in paragraph 118, we recommend that financialassistance for a limited period should be given to a suitable flyingschool so that it can offer advanced training at low rates, preference for vacancies at  the  reduced rates being given to short servicecommissioned officers  who have retired from the  Royal Air  Force.We think that  consideration should be  given to the question of continuing similar arrangements on a permanent basis for  a suitable-number  of short  service  pilots of the  Royal Air  Force at thetermination of their service.F. Licences for Air Line Pilots   157. We recommend  that the pilots  of companies engaged in public air transportation should be  subject to rigorous tests of skill and should be  required to possess special licences indicating thatthey have successfully passed such  tests.G. Aircraft Maintenance   158. We have referred more than once in this report to the necessitywith which air  line operators are faced of employing their aircraft for the  largest possible  number  of hours  during the year.  Thejunction aerodrome system has been devised to facilitate the fulfil-ment of this requirement.  There remains  the  difficulty occasioned by long periods  of immobility to which an aircraft is annually subject at  the time of its complete overhaul preparatory to the renewal ofits certificate of airworthiness.  We would not desire to advocateany relaxation of  the standards of safety that are necessary, but we
understand from enquiries we have made that, as complete recordsare kept of all work done on any aircraft at any time, it may bepossible from the records to certify that an aircraft has been properlymaintained and was in a condition to justify the issue of the necessarycertificate.   The advantage claimed for this method is that the workof reconditioning can  be  carried out  at periods that fit in most conveniently with the  requirements of scheduled services.  We areinformed that this  practice  has been  adopted with advantage  on certain sections of the routes flown by Imperial Airways and on thelargest air  lines in  the United States.  We recommend, therefore,that consideration  be  given to the desirability of  modifying  thepresent practice of inspection so as better to meet the requirementsof the air line operators, whilst at the same  time securing the  air-worthiness of all aircraft transporting mail or paying passengers. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  A. We think that local authorities should make every endeavourto encourage private flying  and we  recommend that due  weight should be given, in reviewing the future subsidy arrangements for flying clubs, to the valuable  work which they have done in the past.(Paragraphs 120 and 121.)  B. We think that encouragement should be given to flying dis-plays designed to bring home the practical  applications of flying,and  that aerodromes should  be made centres of attraction.  Werecommend that aerodrome  owners  should endeavour to populariseflying by the  encouragement of short  pleasure flights, wherever practicable.   (Paragraph 122.)  C- We think that increased publicity  for special  charter servicesmight be  advantageous.  (Paragraph 123.)  D. We  believe internal air services can be made to pay undersuitable conditions.  To achieve this  end it will be necessary toapply restrictions  to  avoid  undue  competition.  We recommendaccordingly that the following routes should be regulated :       Belfast to Manchester or Liverpool.      Glasgow-Edinburgh  to Manchester or Liverpool.      Newcastle to Manchester or  Liverpool.      London  to Manchester or Liverpool.      Portsmouth Southampton to Manchester or Liverpool.      Bristol to Manchester or Liverpool,and that  this  regulation should provide, if  possible, for the co-ordination of flying over these routes.  (Paragraphs 126-132.)  E. We recommend that an exclusive  licence should be given fora period of five years  to a single company or to a combination of companies  working on the closest terms of co-ordination to operatethese routes (Paragraph 133),  and that a licensing authority shouldbe appointed to select the licensee or licensees.  (Paragraph  134.)
  F. We think that this authority should also be charged with the licensing of all regular internal air passenger services.  (Paragraph135.)  G. We  recommend that freedom of flight for  aircraft  withoutradio should be maintained as far as possible, but that certain heightlayers and zones should  be reserved  for radio-controlled aircraft.(Paragraph 140.)  H. We recommend that all radio facilities,  a meteorologicalorganisation  and a  comprehensive air traffic control  organisationadequate to secure the safety and regularity of air communicationsshould be provided, maintained and operated by the Government,and that in present circumstances no expense connected with this service should  fall upon  aerodrome proprietors.  (Paragraph 142.)We think that in due course it  should  be  possible to recover thesecosts from  aviation itself  through the medium of  registration feesor otherwise.   (Paragraph 143.)  I. We recommend that aerodrome proprietors should be respon-sible for providing the necessary equipment, other than radio, toenable their aerodromes to be used in safety under all conditions ofvisibility.  (Paragraph 145.)  J. We think that while the private ownership of public aerodromesshould not be prohibited, it is desirable that they should generally be  in  the ownership  of local  authorities  or  statutory  bodies.(Paragraph 146.)  K. We recommend that there should be standard scales of aero-drome charges in  operation throughout the  country.  (Paragraph147.)  L. We  recommend that the local authorities in all the largertowns and  centres of population should take early steps to see thata suitable site for a standard aerodrome is secured for their citizens,and we draw attention to the desirability of provision being made for  faerodromes in  other localities.   (Paragraph 148.)                    I  M. We point out in particular the urgent need  for the provision  Fof a fully  equipped standard size aerodrome in Scotland to serve  IEdinburgh and Glasgow, and the desirability of further development  Iat  Belfast,  Bristol,  Manchester,  Newcastle,  Portsmouth  and  \Southampton.  (Paragraph 149.)                                   \  N. -We think that as soon as the necessary ground organisation is completed, night mail services  between London and Glasgow-Edinburgh,  and  London and Belfast  should be  instituted,  thusaffording  a valuable improvement in postal facilities.  At a subse-quent stage we think that further night mail services should beconsidered.  (Paragraphs 152-154.)  O. We recommend that financial assistance for a  limited period should be given  to a suitable  flying school so that it can  offeradvanced training for air line pilots at low rates, preference being
given to Short Service pilots who have retired from the Royal AirForce.  We think also that  consideration should be  given  to thequestion of continuing similar arrangements on a permanent basis for Short Service pilots of the Royal Air Force.  (Paragraph 156.)  P. We recommend that  pilots of companies  engaged  in airtransportation should be  subject  to  special  tests of  skill.  (Para-graph 157.)  Q. We recommend that consideration be given to the desirabilityof modifying the present practice of inspection to meet better therequirements of air line operators.   (Paragraph 158.)  In conclusion we wish to express our thanks to the officials of theAir Ministry who have given so much valuable assistance to us inour deliberations and  whose willingness to do so, when  alreadyheavily  burdened with  other  important  business,   we  greatlyappreciate.
