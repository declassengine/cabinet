(THIS D0CD1IENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC          MAJSSTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT).COPY NO,SSiCEEI.  G.F. 38/37G A B I K E  T    INDIA          Appreciation ol the Political Situation, bythe Government of India,, dated 21st January, 1937.          Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State lor India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situationin India, dated the 21st January 1937,  issued onthe authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.     Operations in the Lower Khaisora Valley in NorthWaziristan, which were mentioned in the last appreciationstill continue.   A road has been constructed from Mir Alito Biche Kashkai in the Lower Khaisora Valley, and isbeing continued from there to the Bannu District to linkup with, the main Bannu Razmak road at Dreghundari.  Exceptfor occasional sniping the troops have encountered verylittle opposition.  On December 22nd, 1936,  the RazmakBrigade marched up the Khaisora Valley to Damdil.  Thesecond Infantry Brigade, which had been covering theirmovement, was followed up by about 200 hostile tribesmen&apos;.when it withdrew to its camp in the Khaisora Valley andour losses were 3 killed, including 1 British officer, and13 wounded.  The Faqir of Ipi has his headquarters at a place close to the scene of -operations, and is still encourage-ing active opposition to the Government.          A number of tribesmen from the Afghan side ofthe Durand Lino have obeyed his summons, and at one timethe enemy in the Khaisora Valley numbered nearly 900, themajority of these being Afghan subjects.  Military columnshave, however, recently visited the part of Khaisora Valleyin which these tribesmen were concentrated and most of them have now dispersed.  According to the latest report, thehostile tribesmen in the Khaisora Valley now number only about 100.   The Tori Khel Wazirs, who provided the Faqirof Ipi with his following at the beginning of the trouble,have handed over 100 hostages and 100 rifles as an earnest of their intention to accept Government&apos;s terms when these
are announced to them.2.     Canvassing for the forthcoming provincial electionscontinued briskly in most provinces. The selection of candidates made good progress, and a number of seats will bewell contested.  Internal dissensions among the variousgroups are numerous, and there is often a tendency to placepersonal considerations above questions of policy andprogramme.  The Congress party has in some places found itdifficult to maintain discipline in its ranks, and there are several constituencies in which Congress candidates arestanding against one another.  On the whole,  electioneeringactivities have been proceeding peacefully and have led tolittle disorder.3..     The annual session of Congress took place at Faizpurin the East Khandesh District at the close of the month.  a rural locality was selected on this occasion for the session in order to advertise the claim of Congress to represent the rural population.  In spite of local difficulties the sessionwas, on the whole, well organised and attracted a large numberof visitors.  Among the 22 resolutions passed only a few-were important.  The principal resolution reiterated the rejection by Congress of the Government of India Act and repeated &quot;its resolve not to submit to this constitution orto co-operate &quot;with it but to combat it both inside and outsidethe legislatures so as to end it11 .   The resolution furtherdirected Congress members of the legislatures to put forward in the new assemblies the demand for a constituent assemblyelected by adult suffrage which was to be supported by massagitation outside.&quot;          It was further resolved that the question of acceptance of office by Congress members -would be decided by
                                                         193                                                       3.,the all-India Congress Committee after the provincialelections.  By another resolution it was decided that aconvention should meet after the elections consisting ofthe elected Congress members together with members of theall-India Congress Committee to determine methods of giving effect to the Congress policy in the legislatures and toput forward the demand fox&quot; a Constituent Assembly.  among other resolutions? one warned the country to resist attempts to utilise Indian man-power and resources in the event ofa war in which Britain was involved.  Another called for a nation-wide &quot;hartal&quot; or general strike on the 1st April,the day of the inauguration of the new constitution.Another declared that Congressmen could not participate in any way in functions connected with the King&apos;s coronationand urged the nation to abstain from such participation,but added that this was in no way intended to express anyill will or discourtesy  to the King&apos;s person.  The additionis a significant concession to Indian public opinion whichhas repeatedly given remarkable evidence of its devotionto the Throne on such recent occasions as the Silver Jubileeand the death of King George Y and the accession of his successors.          The revival of the demand for a ConstituentAssembly, which had been in abeyance for the last two years,is not likely to excite much enthusiasm.  Both speechesdelivered during the session and subsequent discussions in the press have revealed a considerable variety ofopinion as to the meaning to bo attached to it and theopportunity which will be found for putting it forward.The proposed convention appears to bo intended as a moansof preserving discipline amongst Congress members of the
4.legislatures and preventing them from adopting -a provincialoutlook, with its consequent danger of being attracted towardscontacts in constitutional parties in the provinces.   a feature of Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru&apos;a presidential addresswas the emphasis laid on the importance of organising amass movement as a means of establishing the power of Congress.The practical method resolved upon to achieve this object isto establish primary committees in villages and towns inorder to assist the penetration of Congress ideas and to placeCongress on a more democratic basis.          The agrarian programme put  forward by Congress in another of its resolutions is, no doubt, intended to furtherthis mass appeal.   Among the items of this programme are asubstantial reduction of rent and revenue and the wiping outof previous arrears of rent.  Since,  however, ail constructivework in the Legislatures is repudiated, it appears that theobject of this programme is only to stimulate extravagantdemands, which may be embarrassing to futux^e Governments, and assist Congress in fomenting unrest.   Another feature of states as a relic of the feudal past and a declaration ofdetermination to resist the introduction of any federalstructure which included the States  as  members.moderate and the socialistic views of the President were kept in the background.   But a clear hint &quot;was given of his personal view that landlordism should ultimately be abolished.The Congress Socialist party, although it exercised someeffects on discussions and demonstrated its increased strength,did not succeed in materially influencing the resolutions adopted by the official body of Congress.  An All-IndiaSocialist Conference was held durin&amp; the Congress Session,the Presidential speech was a bixter attack on the indianGenerally the language used in the si:peech was
but attracted little interest and the same was the fate ofthe All-Indian Kisan Conference.  An attempt to hold a united conference of the various bodies with socialist orcommunist sympathies proved, a failure owing to disagreementamongst their leaders.  One incidental result of theproceedings was the formation of an All-India, YouthAssociation to provide a rallying ground for progressiveelements in the country.          partly owing to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s presence and his influence behind the scenes, the Session came to an endwithout any important clash of views and the semblance of a united front was preserved.  This result was, however, nodoubt influenced&apos; largely by the proximity of the&apos; elections.The Working Committee of the previous year was continued&quot;without a change.4.     A strike has been in progress on the Bengal ITagpurRailway since the 13th December;, arising out of the reductionof 27 men who were offered temporary employment in a lower grade pending their reabsorption in their original grade.This offer was refused and the men wore consequentlydischarged.  About 30,000 men are involved in the strike and there are, at present, no indications of their return towork in the near future.  Meanwhile, mail and passenger services have been fully maintained, while goods servicesvary from 50 to 80 per cent, of normal.5.     A serious explosion in which about 208 lives were lostoccurred at the Poidih Colliery in Bengal on the 18th DecembeWhen descent was possible, the rescue parties found evidenceof great violence below ground and were driven back by densefumes.  AO it was clear that there could be no life in the mine, it &quot;was decided to seal up the shafts to avoid the fresh danger of tire.
