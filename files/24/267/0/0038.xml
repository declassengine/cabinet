Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    SECTION 3 of the Royal Niger Act of 1899, dealing with arrangements for repayment to the Exchequer of the sum of  865,000 advanced for the purchaseof the Niger Company&apos;s rights, provides as follows :           &quot;All  such  sums as the  Treasury  determine to be receipts  from1 the    territories administered by the Company at the passing of this Act in excess    of the necessary expenses of the administration of those territories shall be    paid into the Exchequer, save  so far as those sums are, with the approval of    the Treasury,  applied  towards the development and  improvement of those    territories.&quot;    2.  The  Government  of Nigeria, in that  it is  now  responsible for theadministration  of  the  territories  formerly administered  by the Royal  NigerCompany, is liable to make to the Exchequer any payments which fall to be madeunder Section 3 of the Royal Niger Act, and attention has recently been drawn to this liability by  the Public Accounts Committee.    3.  In order to  determine  precisely  what, if any, payments are due to theExchequer from the  &quot; administered &quot; territories it would be.necessary--    (a)  to define the areas formerly administered by  the Company;    (b)  to determine the receipts and expenditure in respect of those areas.    4.  On the transfer of the Niger Company&apos;s rights to the Crown, practicallythe whole of the area covered by the Company&apos;s  treaties was constituted as the protectorate of Northern Nigeria.  The remainder of the Company&apos;s territory,, asmall belt on either side of  the Lower  Niger,  was  added fo the Niger CoastProtectorate.  Shortly afterwards, the Colony of Lagos  and the Niger CoastProtectorate  were  amalgamated under one administration as Southern Nigeria,and on the 1st January, 1914, Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamatedfor administrative and financial purposes as Nigeria.    5.  The  area covered by the Company&apos;s treaties by no means coincided withthe area actually administered by  the Company.  As a broad statement of fact the Company&apos;s administrative activities and expenditure were limited to thevicinity of the rivers on which their  trading stations were situated.  This isborne out by  the fact that their expenditure on administration at the date of thetransfer did not greatly exceed  50,000 per annum.  At no time  in the  past,however, has any precise. definitionor. delimitation been, made of the &quot; territoriesadministered by the Company at the passing of the Act,&quot;  and no such definitionis practicable at the present time.    6.  It follows also that no separate accounts have ever been kept of receipts and expenditure in respect of the  areas administered  by the Company, and thatit would be  a matter of the very greatest difficulty now to arrive at&apos;  a basis onwhich such  accounts could  be so kept in the future.  It is therefore  impossible      [14464]       .
to ascertain whether any payment has actually become due under the provisionsof Section 3 of the Royal Niger Act of 1899.  At the same time, taking  thefinancial history of Northern Nigeria as a basis, it can be inferred with a high degree  of  certainty that,  if the area  affected had been defined and  separateaccounts had been kept, no claim for repayment would yet have arisen.     7.  Quite apart from the  impracticability of determining what sums have become, or may in the future become, payable by the Government of Nigeria underSection 3 of the Royal Niger Act, there are certain other considerations whichhave satisfied me  (and I understand have  also satisfied  the  Chancellor of  theExchequer) that, in all the circumstances, any claim for repayment should now he abandoned      (a) The Charter was granted to the Royal  Niger Company in 1886  for reasons of Imperial policy  and in  the interests  of  British  trade,  and  theCompany&apos;s rights were purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1899.   Thedecision embodied in  the Royal Niger Act  to  impose  upon  the  territories concerned  liability for  repayment of the sum paid  to  the  Company by HisMajesty&apos;s Government would, in my opinion, be difficult to defend in the light ofour  present-day principles of  Colonial  administration, and  I  should  be  most reluctant  to place the  Governor of Nigeria in  the position of having to defendsuch an imposition in his Legislative Council, the members of which are probablyunaware of the existence of this Act or of its implications.  ;   (b) From 1900 to  1912 annual grants-in-aid averaging over  300,000 weremade from the Exchequer to Northern Nigeria.  In 1913, in connection with  theforthcoming amalgamation of  Northern and Southern Nigeria, it was agreed between the Colonial Office and the Treasury that,  as from that  year, grants of 100,000 a year should be made for five years only, after which, unless unforeseencircumstances : should  arise,  grants-in-aid should  cease; and,  on this under-standing,  Treasury control was discontinued. After the period of five years had elapsed no further grants-in-aid were sought; and it may fairly be inferred that,but.for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Nigeria, grants-in-aid wouldhave been required for  the North considerably in excess of the grants of  100,000for five years which were actually made.     (c) Nigeria&apos;s contribution towards the cost  of the War has been estimated at 1,355,000, and since 1916 Nigeria has administered the British portion of  the cameroons (which formerly received a  large grant-in-aid  from  Germany),  andhas  borne deficits  in respect  of the mandated  territory estimated at a total  of 753,082 at the 31st March, 1935.     (d) The Governor of Nigeria has informed me that  he intends to ask  hisLegislative  Council before the end  of the current financial year  to  vote a contribution of at least  50,000 to His Majesty&apos;s Government towards defence expenditure, and that he is confident that the motion will receive the support ofthe Council.     8.  I am informed that this contingent  liability  cannot be extinguishedwithout an amendment  of the Royal Niger Act,  and I  should like  to  have authority  for the introduction of a short Bill for this purpose.                                               (Initialled)       W.  O.  G.     Colonial Office, Downing Street,           January 29, 1937.
