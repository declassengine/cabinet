THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1937.SECRET.                                                        Copy No. 4gCP. 42 (37).CABINET.CABLE  AND WIRELESS,  LIMITED.              Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     I  CIRCULATE herewith for very early consideration copies of a report tothe Governments of the Empire on the affairs of Cable and Wireless, Limited,submitted by the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, together witha  telegraphic summary*  of  the  Committee&apos;s  recommendations and  a drafttelegramt  which, if my  colleagues agree, I  propose should  be despatchedimmediately to the Governments in the Dominions and India, stating the viewof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on these recommendations.     2.  This Report by the Advisory Committee represents a new effort to dealby agreement between the parties concerned with the situation of the Companycharged by the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 192&amp; with the conductof the main overseas telegraph services of the British Empire.     3.  The essential problem at the  present time is to prevent a breakaway bythe Dominions and India from the Imperial Communications scheme envisaged by the 1928 Conference.  The co-operation of the Empire in this scheme, whichwas  accepted in 1928, is free and voluntary.  Canada and Australia each havelocal companies operating overseas wireless telegraph services in loose association with the British Cable and Wireless merger; and South Africa and India havelocal companies which operate cable services and wireless services  jointly, paying a wayleave and a share in profits to the British  Company.   Except in Canada,where  there are special circumstances, all these  local companies  are earning ahigh rate of profit.   Though Cable  and Wireless, Limited,  has  a  large  share-holding in certain of these companies,  it exercises very little real  control; butit is able to block any reduction of rates on the cables and  also on the wireless services where it controls the British end of the circuit.    4.  Meantime foreign  wireless   telegraph  undertakings,  particularly  theJapanese and the Americans, are ready and anxious for their own reasons to opendirect wireless services with the Dominions at cheaper rates, and this can often be done to the immediate  profit of  the Dominion Company.  It is extremelydifficult to check this process, and in recent times direct services between canada and the Far East, Australia and Japan, India and China have become a possi-bility; while South Africa has refused to bar traffic from  Japan coming by acircuitous wireless route to avoid the higher charges on the British cable system.    5.   If co-operation between the Dominions and India and the British cable and Wireless Company  is withdrawn, and competitive services are establishedwholesale within the Empire, the result must be  disastrous  to the Company, aswell as a serious set-back to the principle of Imperial co-operation.  After making-large economies  Cable and Wireless,  Limited, has not succeeded in earning asmuch as 3 per cent, on its capital, and may stand to lose severely in the futurefrom competition on its  foreign routes,  from a reduction of exchange profits,                     * Annex A     .  [14516]f Annex B.
and from the competition of the subsidised air mail.  Its low earning power hasprevented the Company from developing any vigour or boldness of policy.  It hasnaturally been unwilling to face any reductions in rates within the Empire sincethe result might be an immediate loss which would still further reduce the returnto the shareholder.  This difficulty is accentuated by the ownership of the cable and Wireless Company  belonging,  in effect, to  the  overcapitalised  holding company, Cable and Wireless (Holding), Limited,  which has  some  30 millions of &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; ordinary shares, which have never received  a dividend, andover  16 millions of 5^ per cent. Cumulative Preference Shares on which dividendis nearly two years in arrears.    6.  The result of this situation has been a chronic state of grievance on thepart of the  Company.   It complains that it paid too high a price for the cableassets belonging  to the British  and Dominion Governments,  which  it acquiredin 1928; that the rental of  250,000 per annum payable to the British Post office for the lease to 1953 of the Beam wireless stations in the United Kingdom  (whichcost the Post Office only about  300,000  to erect) is extortionate; that it is entitledto a practical monopoly of telegraph services within the Empire and should  be compensated by the Governments concerned if competitive services are establishedor reductions required in existing rates; and finally, that  it is entitled to someparticipation in  the development of the Empire wireless telephone  services.,    7.  These difficulties came to a head  in  1935 when the  then Government-approved Chairman of Cable and  Wireless,  Limited,  appealed to  the  BritishGovernment over the heads of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committeeto have a special Imperial Conference  called to  consider his company&apos;s positionand to review all the arrangements made by the 1928 Conference. This  request was refused, but  early in 1936 it was decided to adopt  the expedient which hasled to the present Report.    8.  This expedient was in effect  to bring together the Board  of the company and the Advisory Committee to investigate jointly all the Conlpany&apos;s claims andto produce, if possible,  an agreed scheme for Government consideration. For thispurpose  arrangements  were made  to appoint a new  Government-approvedChairman of the  Company, Mr.  Wilshaw, in place of Mr. Denison Pender;  andthe Advisory Committee, whose powers would not normally cover so wide a field,were  allowed, with the  approval of all the  Governments, to examine  all theCompany&apos;s claims, a task which required a review of the whole organisation setup by the 1928 Conference.    9.  The result  has been  so  far  successful that the Advisory Committee  isable in the Report now circulated to recommend a scheme  which in outline hasbeen agreed by the Company, as the result of some six months of negotiations between the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, Sir Campbell Stuart, and theChairman of the  Company, Mr. Wilshaw.    10.  The general tenor of the Report is  to put aside  as  impracticable anyattempt to create a definite monopoly control of Imperial telegraphs and to acceptthe continuance of the basis of the 1928  scheme, which involved the free associationof the Imperial  Governments in support of  a  system  owned and operated by private enterprise.    &quot;11.  The primary object of  the Committee has been to obtain with the least possible delay a satisfactory scheme, acceptable to all the parties concerned, forthe reduction of rates  and the  consequent strengthening  of  inter-imperial relations. Along with this primary object the Committee regard it  as essentialto reform the direction and management of the Company;  and in order to secure agreement with the Company on  both these main  objects, and to put the company in a position to  function most efficiently and economically, in  the  interests  ofusers as well as of its shareholders,  they propose certain specific arrangements,involving concessions on the part of both the  Government and the shareholders.The Government are asked to accept  these  specific arrangements  in principleimmediately, before  the Imperial  Conference.   But  none  of the  proposedconcessions  will  take  effect  until  a  reasonably  satisfactory scheme  of ratereductions has been devised and accepted by the parties concerned,  that  is, theCompany and the partner Governments.  If  no satisfactory settlement  of this
vitally important question, which the Committee believe is the root cause of mostof the present difficulties between  the  Company and the Government,  can bereached, the whole scheme falls to the ground and the Government retain all theirexisting rights against the Company.    12.  The  examination of the rate schedule is  to be undertaken by an ad hoc committee consisting of representatives appointed by the Company and by theAdvisory Committee and conferring at the time .of the Imperial Conference withthe permanent heads of the Postal Departments in the  Dominions and India, whoit is proposed should be invited to attend in London for this purpose.    13.  I hope  that my colleagues will agree with me that this attempt to simplify and narrow the issue, and to work for an agreed settlement of a technicalproblem by technical experts,  outside the Imperial Conference, is the best methodof handling a  difficult situation.    14.  We must next consider  what is involved by the Recommendations whichthe Governments are asked to  accept in general principle before this Rate enquirytakes place. These recommendations, of which a  useful summary will be found on pp. 46-48 of the Report,  are as follows : (1) The Beam  Rental.    This is the annuity of   250,000 payable by the Company to the Post Officeuntil 1953 in consideration of the grant  to the Company in 1928 of a twenty-fiveyears&apos; lease of the Post Office Beam Wireless Stations in the  United Kingdom.The Committee now recommend that this  rental  should be cancelled; that theCompany be given an extension of their licence after 1953 (without limit of time,but subject to mutually satisfactory  arrangements  being  made  between theCompany and  the Government);  and that in return the Company shall transfer to the Government 3 million Ordinary shares of  1 each in the Company creditedas  fully paid  up, within the existing issued capital of  30  millions (i.e., theexisting shareholders must agree to surrender  to the Government  one-tenth oftheir  present  shareholding).   In  effect  the  Government will  exchange  their position as debenture holders for that of partners on  a large scale in the equityof the undertaking.  Financially, the immediate  result (assuming the Companycan pay no more than a 3 per cent, dividend) is to transfer  160,000 a year fromthe pockets of  the British taxpayer to the shareholders in a private enterprise.    15.  These are  serious proposals; but I. do not feel that I should be justifiedin  rejecting them on financial grounds alone.  We cannot allow this vital publicservice to be gradually, but irretrievably, weakened until it must be taken overby the State.  If we do, not only shall we risk the loss of that general Imperialco-operation which  enables the cable  system  to be maintained, but the foreignservices of  the  Company can  hardly  survive.   In  the present  international situation it is vital to preserve the  company&apos;s  cable system  for  defence and intelligence purposes.  I agree with the  Committee,  therefore, that the Companymust  have  a full measure  of Government support.  As regards the financialconcession  required, I  see no political difficulty  in defending this if  it iscontingent,  as is proposed, on a satisfactory revision of the Company&apos;s  RateSchedule.   If the rates grievances of the Dominions are removed, the Governmentconcession will be amply justified as a contribution to  general Imperial co-opera-tion, and as a necessary condition of the revision of rates  to the advantage of the telegraph user.  I have consulted  with  the Postmaster-General on  this matter,and we are in agreement as to  the division of the financial sacrifice involvedbetween the Post Office and the Exchequer.  In effect, the Post Office Fund will accept responsibility for a fixed amount of  100,000 per annum; while the balanceof  the liability, whatever it may be, will fall on the Exchequer.    16.  Legislation will, of course, be necessary to give effect to these proposals,and, indeed, to the whole of the proposed settlement.(2) The Standard Revenue.    1.7.  The  1928  arrangement was based on an assumed. earning capacity of 1,865,000, exclusive of non-telegraph investment revenue; and this sum  (whichwould  permit  of a dividend of approximately  6 per cent,  on the capital  of       [14516]                              &apos;                      B 2
  30 million, was called the Standard Revenue.  Any surplus profits above the Standard  Revenue  were  to  be  allocated  as  to  50  per  cent,  only  to the  benefit  of  the  Shareholders,  and  as  to  the  remainder  to  the  users by way of  reduction  of  rates.   The  Advisory  . Committee now ; recommend that as an off-set against the cancellation of the Ream  Rental, the Standard Revenue be  reduced to   1,200,000, allowing, for a  basic  dividend of 4  per cent.   only.   So  long  as  the  Company&apos;s  normal  earnings do  not  exceed a. certain point,  which calculation shows  to  be   1,436,366, the  existing share- holders will gain under the new system; beyond that point they will be relatively worse  off compared with their present rights.     18.  It is necessary to take into account the indirect effects  of this writing down  on the revenue anticipations of the  Holding Company.  On a short-term view the effect of the scheme will be to improve the position of the Shareholders in the Holding Company; but the present market valuation of that Company is undoubtedly inflated by long-term expectations based on the  present Standard Revenue,  which  cannot be sustained if  the Advisory  Committee&apos;s  scheme is implemented.   It seems probable therefore that the acceptance of the scheme will be followed,  sooner or later, by reconstruction of the Holding Company, and it may be possible to steer this reconstruction on the right lines without involving any direct Government intervention in the affairs of the Holding Company, which Avould be clearly undesirable. (3) The Strategic Cables.    19.  It was  provided in  the Treasury Agreement of 1929 that Cable and Wireless, Limited, should be compensated if it incurs loss  of expense in complying with the strategic requirements of the Governments, but this principle has been held not to cover the upkeep of cables already in existence, even though such cables may become superfluous for commercial purposes.  The recommendation now made thus extends an accepted principle, and follows a similar recommendation by the Greene Committee of Enquiry which investigated the Company&apos;s affairs in 1931. The immediate financial result may not be considerable as the only cables indicated as superfluous at present are three  of minor importance, the maintenance of which  would not appear to justify compensation exceeding  20,000  per annum, if they should  still be required for strategic purposes.    20.  It might be unwise to assume, however,  that other such cases involving substantial expenditure might not arise in future.  I do not consider, however, that the upkeep  of such  cables is a burden  which can fairly  be imposed on acommercial company under existing conditions;  and there may be advantage if, as recommended by the  Committee, this liability is  recognised as  common to the various Governments of the Empire who are particularly concerned.  Legislative power  will  be necessary to enable the Government  to give  the Company a binding pledge of this kind.  The Committee recommend that  the important details outstanding should be examined by the Committee  of Imperial Defence  as soon as possible; and  I agree that this would be desirable.;(4) Overseas Communications Services operated by the General Post Office in the        United Kingdom.    21.  The only point under this head to which  I need specially draw attention is the  recommendation in paragraph 98  (&amp;) (i) of the Report  that negotiations should be opened  at once between the General Post Office  in the United Kingdom and the Company with a view to the transfer of  the General Post Office Anglo1 Continental telegraph services to the  Company, subject to a mutually acceptable basis of settlement.   I understand that the Postmaster-General is of opinion thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should reserve any decision as regards this recommendation.   He is at present unable to see that the proposed transfer would be in the  public interest; he is, however, examining the matter and hopes at an early date to  be able to give his considered Conclusion.  Mean- while,  therefore,  he  would, ask that the draft telegram  to the Dominions and India. (Annex B)  should be amended by the insertion in line 8,  before  &quot;  Subjectto observations below,&quot;  of the words &quot;Subject to further  consideration  of recommendation  (4), and.&quot;
5250(5) The Board and the Advisory Committee.  ;    22.&apos; Neither of. the two methods of Government  control of the Company,which were set up by the 1928 Conference, has proved  altogether satisfactory inpractice.  The first Government-approved Chairman of  the  Company,  the  lateSir Basil  Blackett, resigned his  Chairmanship  in  1932  and his successor,Mr. Denison Pender, resigned the Chair in 1936.  The appointment of the secondGovernment-approved Director is now  in  abeyance.   For obvious reasons theAdvisory Committee does not stress this aspect in its Report,  but it is clear thatthe Company has shown in the past definite weakness in  its direction and manage-ment. A strengthening of the organisation is essential.  The Advisory Committeewas intended to  give the Imperial Governments who are represented upon  it avoice  in the Company&apos;s policy and was vested with certain  powers of veto onrates  and supervision of routes.   The Advisory  Committee has  performed very useful services up to the present, but there is obviously  a likelihood of lack ofharmony between a responsible Board and a standing Committee  paid by theCompany, with practically no executive powers  and without  responsibility forresults, but  entitled to a share in  decisions of policy as distinct from business and management.  There is accordingly some attraction  in the recommendation that the Advisory Committee should be superseded by the addition of what maybe termed Imperial Directors to the Board.  Some control of this kind is necessaryin the case of  a private  company conducting a public service  on  quasi-monopolylines; and the Committee&apos;s proposal provides an Imperial  link with the Companyby requiring the approval of Directors by the various Governments of the Empireinstead of by the United Kingdom Government alone.   Nevertheless, the  reserva-tions on this recommendation by the Representatives of South Africa and of theIrish  Free  State indicate that it  is unlikely  to secure  unanimous assent in theDominions.  It is urgent to secure the consent of the  Dominions and India tothe general scheme at a very early date if the plan for the expert consideration ofthe rate schedule in consultation with the heads of the Dominion postal services atthe time of the Imperial Conference is to proceed.  I accordingly propose, as analternative to  the  Committee&apos;s recommendation, that  the Advisory Committeeshould be retained in some  suitable form which can be considered later, but thatthe United Kingdom Government (which will be a substantial shareholder) shoulddirectly appoint  three  new  Government  directors  to the Board  as  well asapproving the Chairman of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., on the nomination of theCompany as at present.   This will give us the desired opportunity to strengthen the present organisation.   This  change in the plan  put  forward  by  theCommittee  and accepted by the  Company can only be  carried if the Companyconcurs; but I do not anticipate great difficulty if the Dominion  Governmentsagree in the general scheme.  I have consulted the Chairman of the AdvisoryCommittee and having regard to all the circumstances he concurs  in the amendedproposal.(6) The  Rate Schedule.                                                    : ;    23.   I  have  dealt with this vital part of the plan  earlier in this paper(paragraphs 11-12).    24.   I  consider that taking the plan as a whole and  subject to  the amend-ment of recommendation (5) the scheme offers  a hopeful prospect of  a settlementof a very difficult situation; and I am prepared to admit that the value to thisCountry and the Empire of the cable system controlled by Cables and Wireless,Limited, must outweigh the financial sacrifices, substantial  though  these are,which the scheme requires from public funds.    25.  I accordingly recommend that the scheme  be approved by my colleagues in general principle, and that the Governments in the  Dominions and India beinformed accordingly in the  terms of the draft telegram which is attached tothis paper.            .                       .            ,      .   &apos; .. \ ,  &apos;                                                  (Initialled)      N..

ANNEX A.    Draft Telegram to Dominion Governments and India Summarising the                      Recommendations in the Report,(Secret.)    REFERENCE my telegram        of                   : Following sum-mary of Report to Governments by I.C.A.C.  forwarded for your  consideration.As result of situation explained in Committee&apos;s Report of May 1936, Committeegiven full powers by Governments to investigate jointly with Cable and Wireless,Ltd., Company&apos;s claim for complete review of all arrangements made by Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference 1928, and six specific proposals made by Company.Committee now proposes for consideration by Governments scheme which cable and Wireless (Limited), is prepared to accept covering six specific recommenda-tions.  Main points in recommendations as follows :-(1) Beam Rental in United Kingdom.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in United  Kingdom to cancel Beam Rental nowpayable by Cable and Wireless (Limited) ( 250,000 per annum plus 12 per cent, of surplus profits over Standard Revenue) and to grant  to Company freehold of BeamStations in  United Kingdom, an  extension of licence and two other minor con-cessions in consideration of transfer  to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in UnitedKingdom of 3,000,000  1  shares to be found from  existing  capital of Company.(2) Standard Revenue.    Instead  of  present Standard. Revenue  arrangements  Cable  and Wireless(Limited), to be entitled  to pay  basic dividend of 4 per  cent, on capital of 30,000,000 (including  3.000,000 share capital to be allocated to United KingdomGovernment under (1) above);  any surplus earnings to be allocated one-half togeneral purposes of Company, one-half to rate reductions, &amp;c.(3) Strategic Cables.    Governments to agree in principle that Cable  and Wireless (Limited)  shallbe compensated by  Governments concerned for upkeep of cables not required for commercial purposes,  which  Governments decide must be retained for strategicreasons; important  details to  be  settled  to  satisfaction  of Governments  afterenquiry by  Committee of Imperial Defence.(4) Overseas Communications Services operated by General Post Office in United-        Kingdom.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to agree to negotiationsbeing opened on Anglo-Continental Telegraph Services operated by General PostOffice with  view to these services  being  transferred  to Cable  and Wireless,Limited, subject to mutually acceptable basis of settlement.(5) Board and Advisory Committee.    Governments to agree to addition to present Board of  Cable  and Wireless,Limited, of  seven new Directors each nominated by Company  and approved byone of Governments now represented on Advisory  Committee. At  appropriatestage Advisory Committee to be dissolved and arrangements made to satisfaction of Governments for  allocation  of  Committee&apos;s powers (mainly veto  on  rateincreases and veto on disposal of assets required for Empire services, whichpowers must remain with Governments).(6) Rate Schedule.    Comprehensive examination of Company&apos;s rate schedule to  be carried outby Committee of five under Chairmanship of Chairman of  Cable  and Wireless,Limited, with two  representatives appointed by Company and two by AdvisoryCommittee.   Governments to  send  Permanent  Heads of  respective PostalAdministrations to attend in London at time of Imperial Conference this year toconfer with above  Committee to formulate acceptable  rates scheme.  Above
Committee not to be appointed until general scheme outlined  above  is accepted in principle by Governments concerned; but none of recommendations (1) to (5)above to become effective until reasonably satisfactory settlement on rate scheduleaccepted by the parties concerned, and in any case not before the 1st January,1938.                                &quot; &apos;.   .     Committee asks Governments to decide now  if possible  whether Govern-ments accept recommendations (1) to (5) in general principle  in  order to formbasis for examination of rate schedule under (6)  which will take account  of newbasic dividend of Company and  substantial concession to Company under  (1).Examination of rate schedule timed  to correspond with Imperial  Conference tofacilitate  attendance  of Post Office  heads and consultation  with  responsible ministers from Dominions  and  India.   After specific recommendations above committee states  it does not recommend compensation as claimed by Companyif direct wneless circuits  required  by  Governments  and does not  recommendconcession on Pacific Cable  annuity,  but emphasises need for close co-operation by Governments with Company.  Committee anticipates new  limited dividendshould lead ultimately to reconstruction of Holding Company.  Report  signed by all members, but Representatives of South Africa and Irish Free State  reserve their position  on recommendation (5).ANNEX B.   Draft  Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom to            His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Governments in Dominions and India.          (To follow Telegraphed Synopsis of Report as in Annex A.)    MY circular letter of                .  Recommendations of I.C.A.C. havebeen considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom.  They  areglad to&apos; note  that  Committee has reached agreement with Company on  schemewhich offers hopeful prospect  of settlement of outstanding problems.  Recommen-dations involve substantial financial concessions by His Majesty&apos;s Government inUnited Kingdom, who consider, however, these will be justified if they can be thebasis on which lasting settlement can be reached with all Partner Governments onCompany&apos;s rate structure.  Subject to observations below on Recommendation 5,His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom approves scheme in principle andsubject to reasonable settlement on rates  schedule will be prepared for their part to consider in due  course necessary  detailed amendments of existing agreements and to  seek any requisite statutory authority.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  inUnited Kingdom considers it essential, however, to strengthen executive organisa-tion of Company.  They would have been prepared for their part to concur inRecommendation 5 on  ground that appointment of new directors approved  byPartner Governments on nomination of Company would afford good prospect ofcombining vigorous direction of Company&apos;s affairs with control  of  policy  byPartner Governments.  In  view,  however, of  reservations  on  this point  by representatives of South Africa and Irish Free State, it  appears  unlikely thatunanimity can be obtained on this Recommendation. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin United Kingdom now proposes  as alternative, if  Company will concur,  toretain Advisory Committee in some agreed form and to appoint three new UnitedKingdom  Directors to Board of Company.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in UnitedKingdom  have conferred with  Chairman,  I.C.A.C.,  who, in view of all  thecircumstances, concurs in this alternative.  It is hoped that the Partner Govern-ments will be in agreement in principle  with the general scheme subject  to this modification of Recommendation 5, as otherwise examination of rate  schedulecannot proceed.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in  United Kingdom will be glad tobe notified by  telegraph of  your  Government&apos;s  decision not later  than  the27th February so that with concurrence of all concerned necessary arrangements can be made. regarding attendance  of  executive heads  of  respective  postaladministrations in London at time of Imperial Conference.

INTRODUCTION    1. Since we last reported to the Governments of the Empire on 19th May,1936  (Paper No. 866-A), we  have examined jointly with Cable and  Wireless,Limited, the six proposals put forward by the Company which were set out in that report and other important matters, and we now submit out Report.    2. The claim made by the Company (which we will refer to below as C.  &amp; W.Ltd.)  was that  the next Imperial Conference should review all the  arrangementsset up by the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928, having regard tothe inability of the  Company,  for causes outside its control, to earn the revenuecontemplated by that Conference, and having  regard also to  the need to protect the Company against foreign competition within the Empire.   The Company madesix specific proposals which can be stated shortly as follows :-      (i)  Direct Wireless Services         - No new direct wireless services to be allowed between the Empire and      foreign points save with compensation  by Governments to the Company      for any loss sustained.      (ii)  Rates          A revision of the rate schedule and no individual rate reductions mean-      time save wdth compensation by Governments to the  Company for any loss      sustained.      (iii) Strategic Cables          Compensation to the Company for the upkeep of strategic cables.      (iv) Beam Rental          Abolition of the  payment to the Postmaster-General in  the United      Kingdom of  250,000 per annum.      (v)  Pacific Cable Board Annuity          Abolition of the annual  payment of  77,545 by the Company to the      National Debt Commission.      (vi) Overseas Telephone Services          Proposals to be framed with regard to the overseas telephone services      conducted by the G.P.O. in the United Kingdom  on  the principle that the      operation of  these services should be in the same hands as the overseas      telegraph.    3. We recommended that the Advisory Committee should be given full powers by the Governments to investigate all these claims in collaboration with the Companyprior to the Imperial Conference.   We also recommended  that, pending our further report, proposals for new direct wireless services and claims  for reductions in rates should remain- in abeyance.  All  the Governments  concerned agreed, but minorreservations were made in two cases.  The Government of Canada, though in generalagreement, pointed  out that it had agreed to issue a licence for a trans-Pacificservice from Vancouver to the Canadian Marconi Company,  though no licence had actually been issued. The Australian Government, while anxious to do everything in its power to facilitate the Committee&apos;s investigation, preferred not to give a formal standstill undertaking but agreed not to reopen these matters except in themost  exceptional circumstances  and in consultation with  the Committee.   Weinformed the Company of. these reservations.    4. In accordance with a further recommendation in our  Report  we did notcommence our investigation till certain  changes had been made on  the  Board ofC. &amp; W. Ltd.    Previously the Government-approved Chairman of C. &amp; W. Ltd.was Mr. J. C.  Denison Pender, who was also a Joint Managing-Director of that  (C24174)                                                                j, 4
Company, and Governor  and  Joint  Managing-Director of Cable  &amp;  Wireless(Holding)  Ltd. (referred to  below as  C.  &amp; W.  (H.) Ltd.).  The two other JointManaging-Directors of C.  &amp; W. Ltd.  and C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd.  were Sir NormanLeslie and Mr. Edward Wilshaw.  On 24th June,  1936, Mr. Denison Pender vacatedthe positions of Chairman and Managing-Director of C. &amp; W. Ltd., though retaininghis other positions within the group.  Sir  Norman Leslie also resigned his positionas Joint Managing-Director,  and ceased to be a  Director or to be associated withthe group in  any way.   With the  approval of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom, Mr.  Wilshaw was then  elected Chairman of C. &amp; W. Ltd.Mr. Wilshaw also became  sole Managing-Director of this Company.    5.  After the above changes had been made,  further discussions took  place between the Company and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom withregard to the post of the second. Government  approved Director.  Governmentapproval of  this post was  in abeyance, but it was eventually decided to postpone the appointment of  a new approved Director.  When this decision was reachedwe were at  liberty to pursue our investigation.  On  17th  July, 1936, the Sub-Committee which we had appointed for this purpose at our 90th Meeting (Minute III),communicated with  Mr. Wilshaw, the new Chairman, who placed himself  unre-servedly at our disposal.  We wish to record here our appreciation of the way inwhich Mr. Wilshaw  has assisted us in the inquiries and negotiations which havetaken place  from that time onwards.   THE  IMPERIAL  WIRELESS AND CABLE CONFERENCE OF 1928    6.  The situation before the Imperial Conference of 1928 was that the cableundertakings  operating under Government  control and under private enterprisebetween the constituent parts of the British Empire could not continue on a payingbasis in face of unrestricted competition on the part of the Beam Wireless Servicesoperated by  the  General  Post  Office in the United Kingdom.   It was feared that  the  cable  system of the  Eastern and Associated Telegraph  Companiesmight be liquidated and come in part  at  least under foreign control.  Such a situation was obviously intolerable, since, owing to the lack of complete secrecy and certainty, wireless could  not yet supersede  the cables, which were of great value to  the Empire for commercial and strategical purposes.    7.  A possible  solution of this problem by the Conference was offered by a merger which was arranged, subject to certain conditions, between the Eastern andAssociated Telegraph Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company.This  merger  was arranged outside the  Conference  as the result  of negotiations between  the two interests started prior  to the Conference.  It was based on theformation of  a merger company with a total capital of  53,000,000 to acquire theordinary shares of the Cable Companies and all the shares and debentures of the marconi Company.  This merger company is the company now known as Cable and wireless (Holding) Limited.    8.  Under the scheme recommended by the Conference a new CommunicationsCompany, which is the  Company now known as Cable and Wireless Limited, was formed with  a capital of  30,000,000, in which the purely  &quot; communications &quot;aspect of  the undertaking could be segregated.  The Holding Company  (nowC. &amp;  W. (H.) Ltd.) thus holds the bulk of the shares in the old Cable Companies,with  their great investment reserves, and of the shares in the Marconi Company,now purely a manufacturing concern.   The old Cable Companies and the marconi company hold all the share capital of the Communications Company,
    9. This  Communications Company leased from the British  Post  Office theBeam wireless stations for 25 years at a rental of            (a) A basic sum of  250,000 per annum ;           (6) As  from 1931  an addition of 12 per cent, on  any increase in the      Company&apos;s profits above the Standard Revenue referred to below ;           (c) A cash payment of  60,000.It also acquired the Government cable assets on the following basis : -           (i) A payment of  516,486 in cash for the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s cables      and an undertaking to meet the annual payment to the National Debt      Commission of  77,545  until 1949, known  as  the Pacific  Cable Board      Annuity ;           (ii) A cash payment of  450,000 to the British General Post Office for      the Atlantic cables ;           (hi) A  cash payment of  300,000 for the Government interests in the      West Indian cable and wireless system.The payment by the Communications Company of the Beam Rental and the pacific cable Board Annuity is guaranteed by the Holding Company.    10. With regard to the Direction and Management of the undertakings it was laid down that the Board of Directors of the  Holding Company, the Communica-tions Company,  the Cable and Marconi Companies should be identical and that twoof the Directors, one of whom was to be Chairman of the Communications Company,should be persons  approved by His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,on the nomination of the Cable Companies.  The reason for identical Boards wasto avoid the risk of separate and possibly conflicting policies being pursued by thedifferent entities in the undertaking.    11. A  standard  net  revenue  from communications services of  1,865,000(exclusive of non-telegraph investment revenue) was fixed for the  purposes of the communications Company ;  all net revenue above the standard  (after deduction of additional Beam  Rental/under para. 9(6) above) to go as  to 50 per cent.to the Company,  and as to  50 per  cent, to reduction of  rates or such  other purpose as an Advisory Committee might  approve.  The object of this provision was to prevent the  exploitation of the users of  the  public telegraph  services for the  benefit of the  shareholders in a  private  undertaking.   A  proportionof excess  revenue above the standard was allotted to the Company in order to give an incentive to  the Company to develop its services beyond the  point where  thestandard  net revenue was earned.    12. As the  Communications Company was one  which closely concerned theseveral parts of the Empire it was deemed essential that the Governments interestedshould have  a voice in  the direction of policy of  the undertaking and  that  astrustees  for  the  public  they  should  exercise  additional  control  over policybeyond that secured by the approval by the United Kingdom Government of thenominations  of two  members  of  the  Board.  The Communications  company was, therefore, required to consult, in regard to questions of policy (as  distinct from questions  of ordinary business and management),  an  Advisory Committeewhich is  now the Imperial  Communications  Advisory Committee ;  and  sincethe main  concern of the Governments was to secure  an efficient and cheap service this Committee was to be  given  absolute powers  in  regard to any proposed increase of existing telegraphic rates and the allocation of surplus funds to rate
reduction.  As finally constituted the Advisory Committee consisted of representa-tives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South  Africa,  Irish Free State and India,  and a representative of  the Colonies,Protectorates and Mandated Territories.    13. Certain additional safeguards and  conditions were recommended by theConference, including a guarantee of British control of all the Companies.    14. With  regard to  Overseas  Telephone  services  the Conference made  a recommendation in the following terms :             &quot; The Post Office  in London will reserve the  right to  conduct the       external telephonic  services  of Great Britain ;  but will agree with the       Company the terms on which it will have the right  to use the Company&apos;s       wireless stations or portions thereof for telephonic purposes.&quot;    15. None  of the formal recommendations of the Conference applied to the separate undertakings conducting communications in the Dominions and in India ;but in one of  its concluding paragraphs (para. 44) the Conference dealt with the wider Imperial basis of the merger scheme.   In view of the importance which hasbeen attached to this paragraph we will quote it in full  :             &quot; The  above scheme is designed to secure  a common  basis for the       conduct of the Telegraphic Communications of the various parts of the Empire.       The full benefits  of the scheme can  only be  secured by the whole-hearted       co-operation on the  part of  all  the Governments concerned and of the       undertakings conducting  telegraphic  communications  throughout  the       Empire.  The establishment or authorisation of services within the Empire       which work in opposition to, or indeed out of harmony with, the  above       scheme would deprive it of much of its value and would militate against the       objects which we have endeavoured to attain.   We  recommend, therefore,       that, if our proposals commend themselves to the Governments of the several       parts of the Empire, they should take steps  to apply the principles  of the       scheme, with such modifications in  points of  detail as may  be necessary       to meet local conditions, to the overseas telegraphic undertakings operating       within their jurisdiction.           For example, it will be  appreciated that the prospects of harmonious       working might be prejudiced if any of the undertakings concerned were not       under predominant British  control.&quot;     16. The recommendations of the Conference were  accepted by  the ImperialGovernments  concerned  and the  obligations  between the  Companies and thePartner Governments were defined in  an  Agreement known as the  &quot; TreasuryAgreement &quot; of 29th May, 1929.  The Partner Governments were the  Governmentsof the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the IrishFree State and India.     17. Scarcely two years had elapsed from the date of  this Agreement beforethe unsatisfactory operating results of  the Company brought the whole  scheme under review.   The collapse of international trade in 1930 involved such a shrinkagein international telegraphic traffic that  it seemed likely that C.  &amp; W. Ltd. (thenknown as Imperial and International Communications - Limited) would soon  be operating at  a loss.  When the Company proposed  to remedy this position by increasing rates outwards from the United Kingdom and mainly on Empire routesby some 75 per cent, we  decided that an inquiry should be held into the positionof the Company by an independent tribunal.   In July, 1931, we appointed a Com-mittee for this purpose consisting  of Sir (then Mr.)  Wilfrid Greene (Chairman),The Rt. Hon. Lord Ashfield, and Mr. Lawrence D. Holt.  This Committee, whichis referred to  as the &quot; Greene Committee,&quot;  reported in November, 1931  (PaperNo. 4-B).
                       THE  GREENE COMMITTEE    18. The Greene Committee examined and rejected proposals for transferring the undertaking to some form of State ownership, and decided that the existing organisation should continue.  It  found that the fall  in the Company&apos;s revenuewas due to trade  depression and competition, and that the failure to meet these difficulties arose from the  system of  Direction  and Management.  It proposed a complete overhaul of management  and expenditure and made a number of specific proposals  to this end, instead  of the wholesale increase of rates contem-plated  by the  Company.  The conclusions  and recommendations  which  haverelevance to the present situation may be summarised as follows :           (i) The capital of the  Communications  Company should be written      down  and  consideration  should  be  given to writing down the Standard      Revenue.          (ii) The cost  of  maintaining any cables required solely  for strategic      and not for commercial purposes should be borne by the State.          (iii) It  was regretted that agreements for joint  working of  cables and      wireless had not been reached in many parts of  the Empire.   The Govern-      ments who were closely concerned with the welfare of the cable system should      consider how these agreements could be facilitated.          (iv) Advantage was  seen in completing the rationalisation  of  com-      munications services in the United Kingdom by transferring to the Company      all the external services (telegraph and telephone) operated by the General      Post Office.  As the Greene Committee had only  heard one side of  this      question.it made no specific recommendation.          (v) As  regards Government  control an extension and development of      the work of the Advisory Committee was  advocated and the  arrangement      for Government approval of two Directors  of the Company was condemned      on the ground of the dual responsibility involved.    19. We  dealt with the recommendations  of  the Greene Committee in threeReports to the Governments issued in July, 1932, November, 1933, and May, 1934,respectively.   In the main  the  Company claims that  it has put  into effect therecommendations so far as it was able to do so ;  but  it has only  partially dealtwith the question of capitalisation.  On the Government side no  decision hasbeen taken on the recommendation with  regard to  the  strategic  cables;  andnothing has  emerged with regard  to the suggestion that transfer of  the externalservices operated  by the General  Post  Office in  the United Kingdom should beconsidered.  We stated in our Report  of July, 1932, that  we were  in favour ofthe retention of  the  arrangement for  the  Government   approval  of the  twodirectors of  the Company, and that we did not consider that any  conflictingresponsibilities were involved.    THE PRESENT POSITION OF IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS20.  We propose to examine the position under the following heads :        (i) The communications services operated by C. &amp; W. Ltd.       (ii) The technical efficiency and development of the Company&apos;s system.       (iii) Relations with  the Communications Companies  in the Dominions  and  India.       (iv) The  general  position  of world  communications  as  affecting  C. &amp; W. Ltd.
            COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES  OPERATED BY C.  &amp; W. LTD.    21. These  services are briefly :        Cables :            (a) The Trans-Atlantic cables connecting Great Britain and Canada.           (b) The system previously  owned by the  Eastern  Telegraph and       Associated  Companies connecting Great Britain,  Australia, New Zealand,       South Africa, India,  East and West Africa, the Far East and South America.           (c) The Trans-Pacific cables connecting  Canada, New  Zealand and       Australia.           (d) The cable system serving the British territories in the West Indies       and the  Caribbean Sea.       Wireless :            (a) The Beam services between Great  Britain and Canada, Australia,       South Africa and India.           (b) The wireless  services previously  owned  by  Marconi&apos;s Wireless       Telegraph Company, notably those between Great Britain  and the U.S.A.,       Egypt and  South America.           (c) Some twenty new wireless telegraph circuits opened by C. &amp; W. Ltd.       since  the  merger,   notably  between Great Britain  and Japan,  Teheran,       Kenya, Falkland Islands, Southern Rhodesia, Turkey and China.           (d) Wireless telephone  services from  Bermuda to  New York, from       Nairobi  to London,  and from Jamaica  to Miami.           (e) A number of coast and air stations mainly in Africa.           (/) Phototelegraphic or facsimile services from London to New  York,       Melbourne and Buenos Aires.    22. A map of the  Company&apos;s system is attached to this Report.  This system is built up on the basis of the cables which were  originally the main trunk finesfor world communication.   It consists of some 156,000 nautical miles of submarinecable,  or about one-half the world&apos;s total mileage  of cables.  Associated with andsupplementing  this cable  system is a considerable network of wireless  telegraph services operated  by C. &amp; W.  Ltd., in  association with the local communicationcompanies in the  Dominions and  India, and also with  undertakings  in foreigncountries.    23. The services  controlled by  C.  &amp; W. Ltd. thus  include practically thewhole of the external telegraph services of the British Empire and also considerableforeign telegraph services.   The system is really worldwide and the cable networkis so organised that any point has communication through prescribed channels withany other.  C. &amp;  W.  Ltd.  operates cable services  in 72 different countries withoutcounting  the cable stations  operated by associated companies.  It also operateswireless telegraph services in 21 countries apart  from the numerous services ofassociated and subsidiary companies.  Extensions of these services are  conductedto a large number  of countries where C. &amp; W. Ltd.  itself does not operate.    24. In 1929,  C. &amp; W. Ltd. carried about 244 million chargeable  words ofwhich  43 per cent, was within the Empire, 30 per cent,  between the Empire andforeign points,  and 27 per cent, between foreign  points.  In 1935 words carriedwere 212 millions,  of which 38 per cent, was within the Empire, 36 per cent, betweenthe Empire and foreign points, and 26 per cent, between foreign  points.
    25. C. &amp; W. Ltd.  has also important interests outside the system which itdirectly controls.   For example, C. &amp; W. Ltd. holds one-half of the share capital of the Commercial  Pacific Cable Co., which owns the Pacific cable between theU.S.A. and the Far  East.  The remaining share capital of this Company is equallydivided between the  Danish Great  Northern Telegraph Co.  and the AmericanMackay group.  The revenue derived from its holding in this undertaking has made asubstantial contribution towards C.  &amp; W. Ltd.  earnings in  recent years.   the traffic revenues  of the Commercial Pacific Cable Co.  are now diminishing but itderives a substantial income from its  investment  reserves.  The traffic  agreementsmade by the Companies interested in the  Commercial Pacific Cable Co. expire in1940, and the position  has been under examination by the U.S.A. Government.    26. The importance of  the cable system of C. &amp; W. Ltd. to the British Empirehas not diminished since 1928.  Owing to wireless &quot; fading &quot; and other difficulties,the cables can still  offer a better service and greater  secrecy than wireless.   TheCompany thus conducts a public service which  is  vital to the Empire for com-mercial purposes in  time of peace, and for strategic reasons in time of war.   Theimportant foreign interests which the Company controls also contribute greatly toBritish interests, particularly in the  present international situation.    27. There are,  however,  important exceptions to the  Company&apos;s control ofImperial overseas telegraphs.   Most of the cables  on the valuable route between theUnited Kingdom and North America  are owned or operated by US.A. companies.The Commercial Cable  Company and  the Western Union Telegraph company bothoperate terminals and collect traffic from the public in the United Kingdom, thoughsimilar facilities  would not  now be open  to British companies in  the U.S.A.Other services with Scandinavia and the Continent  are operated by the GreatNorthern  Company (which works in  close association  with C. &amp; W. Ltd.) and bythe French P.Q. Company.  The British Post Office also operates telegraph services with the Continent  under arrangements with the European countries dating back for many years. Finally,  the Hong Kong Government still operates wireless telegraph services in competition with C.  &amp; W.  Ltd.  though it has been agreed in principle to transfer these services to  the Company,  and the necessary legalagreements are being prepared.                          TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY    28. A  high  standard  of  speed and accuracy is maintained by C.  &amp; W. Ltd.services.  Since the merger, the extension of the regenerator system of cable workinghas enormously improved cable efficiency.   This system enables signals to be passed on instantaneously  from one cable section  to another without manual retrans-mission.    Since the merger, C. &amp; W.  Ltd. has introduced  ten  through chainsworked on this system, notably between London and Montreal, Hong Kong, Adelaide,Rio de Janeiro,  and Buenos  Aires.   A great increase in  transmission speeds hasresulted;  for example, the average pre-merger transmission time between HongKong and London was 60 minutes ;  the present average time is 15 minutes, or6 minutes for an urgent message.  From the financial point of view very greateconomies have been made by the substitution of regenerator stations  for manualworking at intermediate cable points.  We have been told that in this way theannual cost of one of the Company&apos;s  stations (Ascension Island), has been reducedby  30,000 a year.   Tests have also been made of combined cable and wirelessworking by regenerator ; many  improvements have  also been made in channellingof cables and other devices, including automatic printers and keyboard typewriters;and the extended use of office machinery has greatly reduced the cost of Head-quarters administration.  The broad effect  of these changes is that the cost of cableoperation has been greatly reduced ;  and the life  of submarine cables, particularlyin deep waters, has  proved to be much longer than was originally  expected.  The
 co-ordination of the cable and wireless services under one control contributes to the advantage of both, giving alternative methods of communication which are essential to the maintenance of a high speed public service and facilitating technical improvements.  The Company can see no possibility under present conditions of the wholesale supersession of its cable system by wireless (even if the necessary new wavelengths could be provided) without the shutting down of a large number of its stations all over the world, where wireless  concessions could not be obtained to replace the existing cable rights, and the loss of a great part of its revenue.             RELATIONS WITH COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES IN THE                            DOMINIONS AND INDIA     29.  In Canada and Australia, C. &amp; W. Ltd. still operates cables side  by side with a local wireless company.  In New Zealand, except for certain small Govern- ment wireless- services,  C. &amp; W. Ltd. cables are the sole carrier of external traffic. In South Africa and India cables and wireless are jointly  operated by a local company.   In the Irish Free State, C. &amp; W. Ltd. does not operate directly.   The present position in the various countries may be summarised as follows :  Canada        There is no joint working.  The Canadian Marconi Company operates  the wireless side and C. &amp; W. Ltd. the cable heads, but traffics are pooled and divided between the parties.  The Canadian Marconi Company in addition to its communi- cations interests has substantial manufacturing and other activities.  The Canmar Investment Trust holds 50-4 per cent, of the capital of the Canadian Marconi Company.   The former  Company is controlled by six Trustees, three appointed by Lazard Brothers &amp; Co.  Ltd. and the Whitehall Trust Ltd., one by C. &amp; W.  Ltd., one by the Canadian National Railway and one by the Canadian Pacific Railway. There are some 5,000 &quot;A&quot; shares (with voting rights) in the Canmar Investment Trust and  18,000 &quot; B &quot;  shares (without voting rights).  C. &amp; W. Ltd. has a small holding of  &quot;A&quot; shares  and a proportion of the &quot; B &quot; shares, the greater part of the &quot; B &quot; shares being held by Radio Corporation of America. Australia        There is no joint working.  Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited (A.W.(A) Ltd.) works the wireless side and C. &amp; W. Ltd. the cable ends and branches but traffics are pooled and divided between the parties.  A.W.(A.) Ltd. in which the Commonwealth Government has a controlling shareholding, has manufacturing and other interests.  Three directors out of seven are appointed by the Common- wealth Government.  C. &amp; W. Ltd. has a shareholding in this Company. Union of South Africa        There is joint working under the control of Overseas Communications of South Africa Limited.   C. &amp; W. Ltd. shares in the receipts of this Company, under a variable wayleave, and has also a large shareholding in the Company and appoints one director.  Another  director is  appointed by the Union Government and  six are appointed by the shareholders. India        There  is joint  working under the  control of Indian  Radio and Cable Communications Company Limited, which pays to C. &amp; W. Ltd. a wayleave anda share of net profits.  C. &amp; W. Ltd. has a large shareholding and can appoint four out of twelve directors.  Three directors are appointed by the Indian Government.By the terms of the Agreement between C. &amp; W. Ltd. and the Indian Company of 19th February, 1932, negotiations with the Government of India and the controlof the combined undertaking in India are to be conducted by the Indian Companyfree from interference by C. &amp; W. Ltd.

Under world conditions to-day private  enterprise  in communications  is becoming increasingly difficult in  the face  of competition  from foreign admini-strations and from undertakings subsidised and controlled by foreign Governments.There are 446 distinct wireless telegraph services operated by foreign undertakingsoutside the British Empire.   Not only is Government financial assistance given inmany countries to these undertakings, and particularly in Japan, Italy and Germanybut every means of Government pressure is applied in almost every foreign countryto foster the use of the national  systems to the detriment of the internationalnetwork  of  C.  &amp; W. Ltd.  Canvassing by C. &amp; W.  Ltd.  agents is prevented,discrimination  is applied &apos;by  postal staffs  and  in  several  instances  delays  andindifferent landline service are imposed on the cable user.    32. The position of the cable concessions of C. &amp; W. Ltd. in foreign territoriesis  particularly threatened.   There have been  constant  difficulties  with regardto the Company&apos;s  concession  in Greece, and the  Company has recently  beennotified that its concessions in Italy will not be renewed when they expire.  Evenin the U.S.A., Government  control through the new Federal  CommunicationsCommission is strengthening nationalist tendencies.   A merger Of  the U.S.A.Communications  Companies, though  still some distance  in the  future, must betaken into account as likely to intensify American competition with C. &amp; W. Ltd.The Mackay Companies in the U.S.A. have recently made fresh efforts, so far without success, to start new circuits with Europe.    33. Since the Merger  in  1928 no less  than 153  new short  wave wireless telegraph services have been opened by administrations and companies outsidethe Empire.   This process has resulted in diversion of traffic wholly or in part fromthe system of C. &amp; W. Ltd., and has been accompanied by rate reductions to which. &amp; W.  Ltd. has been obliged to conform :           (a) Diversion has been wholly effected when,  as in the case of traffic       between Italy and China, the traffic is nowhere handed over to C. &amp; W. Ltd.       for onward transmission.          (b) Traffic is partly diverted when it  is handed  over to C. &amp; W. Ltd.       to carry out part of the total transmission, as in the  case of wireless traffic       from  Holland to Australia, which is  handed  over by the  Batavia wireless       for onward transmission by the Company&apos;s cable route to Australia.
     34.  These new circuits  are  all the more damaging  because they naturally arise where there  is a considerable stream of traffic.  Organisations controlling them find retransmission points, where such are inevitable at the greatest possible distance, so as to augment their receipts.     35.  The same process is  at work with regard to foreign traffic with the Empire. An  instance  is  the  case  of  French  traffic  with  New  Zealand,  which  the French Administration  has  endeavoured  to  pass through  the Tahiti wireless, and so avoid the cable route.  The New Zealand Government has refused to accept this traffic via Tahiti, the International  Regulations admitting such refusal.   In the  similar case  of traffic sent from Japan to  South Africa via Belgian Congo wireless, we have made representations to the Union Administration, which  has decided, however,  that it cannot  refuse  this  inward traffic.  If unchecked, this process of dispensing to the greatest possible  degree with the  services of British routes in traffic to  Empire points is capable of much development, and may have serious effects on the Imperial system.     36. There has  been considerable  pressure  by  foreign administrations and companies for direct services with certain of the  Dominions and India.   Proposals have been made by Germany and France for services with Canada;  by Germany, Japan and U.S.A. for services with Australia; by U.S.A., Holland, Germany, Italy, Japan and  Madagascar, for  services with  South Africa;  by U.S.A.,  China, and French Indo-China for services with India ; and  many other cases would no doubt arise if opportunity offered.   In the main,  however,  the pressure on the Imperial system has been withstood,  and the Imperial Governments have co-operated to support the existing scheme.   For some years  past no new direct wireless services have been introduced with points in the Empire ;  though a new wireless telegraph service between Canada and the Orient is  now  in prospect, and tests have been conducted between India and China.     37. We have investigated the probable financial  effect of these direct circuits, which  normally cause considerable loss to C. &amp; W. Ltd., with a slight gain to  the overseas  company  concerned.   Any  estimate must  be  based  on a  number  of assumptions with regard  to  the probable diversions  of traffic and other matters. In a typical case, C. &amp; W. Ltd. states  that the opening of a direct wireless circuit between  Australia  (A.W.(A)  Ltd.) and  U.S.A.  (R.C.A.  Ltd.)  would result approximately as follows :          C.  &amp; W. Ltd.         &apos;..     ..      ..  loss   . .     24,000 p.a.         Canadian Marconi Co.      ..      . .  loss   . .     16,000 p.a.         A.W.A.......      ..  gain   ..      3,000 p.a.         R.C.A. Communications (U.S.A.)   . .  gain   ..     37,000 p.a.     38. Even greater losses might  result to C. &amp; W.  Ltd.  and  the Canadian Marconi  Company from such a circuit in the  event of a communications merger in the U.S.A.  Shortly, the  result of opening a direct wireless circuit with an Empire point  is that one-half of the receipts on  the traffic affected will accrue to foreign  companies  or  administrations instead of to the  Imperial  undertakings. In addition, further capital expenditure and operating costs will be incurred  bythe Imperial Company concerned.     39. The development of  new wireless services is naturally pressed by foreign countries, which,  apart  from  reasons  of national prestige and self-sufficiency, can thus retain a considerable portion of  the telegraph revenue instead of paying away the major part of the collections to the  cable system ;  but if such services are admitted  and encouraged  within the Empire when  not required for trafficpurposes the result can only  be to  do lasting injury,  and in the end, to break upthe Imperial cable system which  it was the  object  of the 1928 Conference to preserve.

Free services by way of meteorological and other information, use of landing grounds, etc., are valuable additions to the subsidy.    45. The letters carried by Imperial Airways increased from under  3 millions-in 1928-9 to over 17J millions in  1934-5.    46. The development of  air mail services is inevitable, and it is,  of course,proper that such development  should be stimulated by the Imperial Governments.In the long run the increase of business and social contacts which the air mail bringsmay involve also a growth of telegraph traffic.  But the air mail is likely to be at  (C24174)                                                                  c    40. Another  aspect  of  competition  is in respect of press services.  While&quot; spot &quot; news, where time is vital and secrecy is a factor, must generally go by cable,a large and increasing volume of &quot; background &quot; news  is being transmitted bybroadcast, multiple address  and direct address through foreign channels often byirregular methods.  It is stated by the Company that certain foreign Governmentshire wireless transmitters and receivers at cheap rates on a time basis instead of onthe word rate laid down by the International Regulations.  News agencies and news-papers, either by express authorisation or on sufferance, have entered the telegraphfield in competition with the regular telegraph companies.  Negotiations betweenC. &amp; W. Ltd. and the Empire Press Union have recently resulted in a useful schemefor a special class of deferred Press messages at reduced  rates within  the Empire.But by the methods indicated above a large volume of Empire news is transmittedat rates with which C. &amp; W. Ltd. cannot compete.    41. C.  &amp; W. Ltd. is not only subject to  direct competition in its own sphere of telegraphy.  It must undoubtedly be affected by the  competition of overseastelephony services and air mail.   We return to the question of telephony later inthis report  (para. 110).  A more  immediate danger to  C. &amp;  W. Ltd. may be seen in the  development of the air mail services.  More than  20 per cent, of the totaltraffic carried by C. &amp; W. Ltd. is in the form of letter telegrams, a  special  servicedeveloped since the war at a low rate on which a delay is  imposed so that they aredelivered on  one  of the two  following mornings after  acceptance.  This valuabletraffic  is particularly affected by air  mail competition.  For some  countries inEurope air mail is  already more  speedy than such letter telegrams, and in other cases the comparatively slight difference in time is offset by the heavy saving in cost.    42. Projected  services  may  have even more serious competitive  effects.Imperial Airways have 28  flying boats and other aircraft completed or under construction  at a cost of  2,000,000, mainly  for Empire  routes, and intended for services reaching  Canada in 2 days, India in 2\ days, South  Africa in  4J days and australia in 7 days.  Feeder services on the main routes  are also being developed,while the extension of  night flying and increased frequency of the air services must intensify the competition.   Air services will naturally  develop on the busierand more profitable routes.  The  shorter distance and intermediate  feeder services are important financial factors in the maintenance of the  main lines of a telegraphsystem.    43. The  amounts of direct subsidies for air mail services granted by ImperialGovernments in 1935-6 were :         Great Britain
first a serious competitor with the telegraph services.  Both are valuable Imperialservices, but while the air lines are subsidised by the Governments the overseastelegraphs are made to contribute  to Government  revenues  by the payment ofrentals, royalties, and terminal charges.   Such charges are imposed on C. &amp; W..Ltd.in a number of cases simply for revenue purposes and not for work done for theCompany by  Governments.   In effect, therefore,  C. &amp;  W.  Ltd. is obliged tocontribute to the support of its subsidised competitor.      THE FINANCIAL POSITION  AND  FUTURE  PROSPECTS OF                               C.  &amp; W. LTD.     47. We attach as an Appendix to  this Report statements summarising the published balance sheets of C. &amp; W. Ltd. and also  the revenue accounts for the21  months to 31st December,  1929, reduced to an  annual  basis, and for the subsequent years ending with the year to 31st December,  1935.     48. The Company&apos;s working capital  position is now comparatively strong, and considerable reserves  are  available for  future development,  but the Company&apos;revenue has never approached the standard revenue  fixed in 1928.     49. The  Company  attributes failure to reach  the  standard  revenue to thefollowing causes : (a)  Arrangements with the Companies in  the Dominions and India.        The Beam wireless services, operated on routes which were the mainstay ofthe cable system.  The unification  of the Imperial  services recommended by the1928 Conference had  to be secured outside the United Kingdom in  subsequent negotiations  with  the  various  companies and  Governments  concerned.  Sincearrangements were concluded between C. &amp;  W. Ltd.  and the various companies inthe Dominions and India, the financial position of the latter  companies has beenvery much strengthened.   C. &amp; W. Ltd. argues that the arrangements must thus have benefited the overseas companies at the  expense of  C. &amp; W. Ltd.   the overseas companies in Australia, South Africa, and  India are clearly able to earn a much better return on their capital than C. &amp; W. Ltd.    This disparity is no doubtdue to many  causes ;  but among others it is true to say that these companiesoperate on  a  comparatively small number of valuable traffic routes,  whileC. &amp; W. Ltd. has to bear the main burden of maintaining  the world-wide cablesystem, including many services which by themselves bring in little or no return.(b)  Reduction of Rates        Reductions of rates made by C. &amp; W.  Ltd. since the merger calculated on  the traffic at the time  of incidence  and assuming no  increase or  decrease oftraffic are stated to have cost the Company  420,000 per annum.(c)  Competition from Direct Wireless Services,  Telephony  and Air Mail        We deal with these matters elsewhere in this report.(d) Trade Depression        International telegraphic traffic depends largely on the volume of inter-national trade which is still considerably below the 1929 level.(e)  International Telegraph Regulations        C. &amp; W. Ltd. states that the authorisation of a new category of codetraffic (CDE) at 60 per cent, of the plain language tariff has involved loss of revenueon  code traffic since 1st January, 1934, and a decline of receipts on plain languagetele grams due to the inadequate CDE coefficient, making a total loss to the company in excess of  200,000 yearly, which tends to increase.(f)  Gold Collections in Foreign Countries        The Company&apos;s receipts reflect a profit on exchange ( 352,000  net in 1935)arising mainly from the devaluation  of sterling and the maintenance of gold rates in
other countries.  International telegraph rates have not been increased to the goldlevel in most countries within the British Empire and there is a loss to C. &amp; W. Ltd.on remitting from Australia and New Zealand to London.   There is a danger thatthe recent depreciation in certain European currencies may involve at least a partialloss  of these profits, though both Italy  and  Switzerland have increased  theirtelegraph charges in local currency since devaluation occurred.    50. For 1935 C. &amp; W. Ltd. paid  3 6s. 8d.  per cent, ordinary dividend plus 2 2s.  8d. per cent, from reserves;  but the average dividend paid for the years1930 to 1935 inclusive has only been about 1-7 per cent.  Small  as the averagereturn  has been to C.  &amp; W.  Ltd. shareholders since 1929 they have fared betterduring the depression than the shareholders of important overseas communications&apos;companies in the U.S A., which incurred operating losses, e.g., Postal Telegraph and western Union.    51.

Ltd. have remained comparatively stable in the last fiveyears at about a figure of  4,700,000 per annum.    52. With  regard to the economies effected by  C.  &amp;  W.  Ltd. the Companystates that the reductions in expenditure made between 1929 and 1935 as shown inthe annual accounts may be set out as follows :          Working Expenses at Stations, General          Administration, etc.        ......      ..  1,239,000         Maintenance of cables, land lines, etc.  ..     ..      .&apos;.    204,000         Directors&apos; fees............     22,000                                                           1,465,000         Less :           Pension payments,  etc., increase (after eliminating              20,000 for non-recurring payments)   ..      ..     48,000         Making a net reduction of    . .     ..     . .      ..  1,417,000          Part  of this reduction  is  due  to the transfer  to            overseas companies of expenditure amounting to                                                  240,000          Against  which  C.  &amp; W. Ltd. has             taken over branches in the Persian            Gulf and Spain costing   ..     ..       70,000         Making a net transfer of     . .      ..                170,000         The  Company states  that  the  real  reduction  of          expenditure in  1935 as compared with 1929 may          therefore be taken at      ........ 1,247,000(C24174)c2
    53. This is a considerable achievement for which every credit should be givento the Company ;  though these economies were not secured for a number of yearsafter the merger.    54. We have  investigated the &quot; normal&quot; revenue of C. &amp;  W. Ltd. under present conditions by reference to the accounts for 1934 and 1935.  After adjust-ment for &quot; abnormal &quot; or non-recurring items, and including undistributed profits of subsidiary companies, the average net  profits in these two years may be taken         at approximately      . .     . .      . .     . .     ..    825,000         Adding Beam Rental payment       ..     ..     ..  ,  250,000         The &quot; normal &quot; earnings of these years before payment           of Beam Rental average about    . .     ..     . .   1,075,000    55. We may note here that the 1935 Revenue Accounts include as income an item of  208,000 for income tax deducted from dividend less tax paid (treated above as an abnormal receipt).   We understand that it was possible to credit this amountto revenue because  of the accumulations  of income tax wear and tear allowances,which were available and which are likely to be available for some time to come as a set-off  against the Company&apos;s liability for income tax.    56. Both in 1934 and  1935 there were substantial earnings of subsidiary andassociated companies in excess of the amounts credited as dividend in C. &amp; W. Ltd.accounts,  which have been  brought  into  the  normal  earnings  shown  above.C. &amp; W. Ltd. is not in a position to decide the dividend policy of some of these companies.    57. Whether the &quot; normal &quot; earnings indicated by  recent accounts will beretained or improved in future depends on a number of conflicting factors.   Ratereductions  which at first involve a loss may ultimately be remunerative.  Inter-national trade  and  telegraphic  traffic  may  increase  without  involving any sub-stantial addition to  C. &amp; W. Ltd. costs, and recent monthly traffic returns of theCompany have shown an upward tendency. A revision of the present InternationalTelegraph Regulations at  the next International Conference may compensate the telegraph companies at any rate in part for  previous losses.   On the other hand,present &quot; exchange profits &quot; may be reduced  ; some items of expense such as cablemaintenance may be increased ;  and  competition from air mail and state-assistedforeign concerns may be intensified.  In view of the serious risks of the Company&apos;sprofits  being  diminished, it is of vital importance to  maintain Imperial traffic forthe Imperial system, and to give C. &amp; W.  Ltd. the best  possible conditions withinthe Empire.    COMMITTEES  OBSERVATIONS ON  THE PRESENT SITUATION  58. How far then has the 1928 Conference Scheme been successful ?   (a) Fromthe point of view of the Governments  the scheme has achieved its main objects.If competition between the beam wireless and the cables had continued, the cable companies  could hardly have survived  the catastrophic fall in world  trade which began  in  1930.  The  merger scheme has therefore  preserved intact and under british control the cable system, which  is vital for defence, as  a solvent enterprise,without recourse to Government subsidies.  It has  safeguarded  a great businessundertaking with outposts throughout the world which encourages British trade and influence and brings many millions  of revenue annually into British hands.  It haslaid the foundations of an Imperial scheme in which all the nations of the Empirehave  successfully  co-operated.   Finally,  it  has relieved  the Governments  ofresponsibility for a number of cable assets and for the Pacific Cable Board annuity,and the Governments received about  1,250,000 in cash for the assets transferred.
     (b) The shareholder  has been  less fortunate.  While the  merger with  the Beam and Wireless Services preserved the cables as an earning asset, the return on the capital invested in communications assets has been clearly inadequate.     (c) The telegraph user has had  the benefit of a rapid, secret and accurate service, and arising out of the merger substantial reductions were made in certain rates within the Empire.   But latterly reductions of rates have been mainly in the Company&apos;s foreign services, and within the Empire the full benefit by way of rate reductions which the merger was expected to give has not been realised.     59.  As it has worked out, however, the 1928 Merger scheme has presented  a number of  difficulties.            (i) The main difficulty has been the low earning power of C. &amp; W. Ltd.       due partly to the slow realisation of the economies expected from the merger       and partly to the intense pressure of foreign competition and the restriction       of international trade.            (ii) Unity of control and  direction of telegraph communications within       the Empire has been only partially realised.  There is still no joint working       of cable and wireless in Canada and Australia, and the  overseas companies       generally  are  earning higher  rates of  profit  than  C. &amp; W. Ltd. itself.       Though these companies contribute  by dividend and wayleaves to C.  &amp; W.       Ltd.  revenues there may be certain  divergencies of interest  between them.       If these or other companies should be allowed or encouraged by the Govern-       ments to institute  a number  of new direct wireless services  in competition       with C. &amp; W. Ltd.,  the same position would recur which the 1928 Conference       was  called on  to  remedy,  since a breakdown of the existing Imperial       telegraph services could not be far distant.  -           (iii) As constituted by the 1928  Conference, the merger scheme  did not       include complete unification of overseas communications services from the       United Kingdom,   Various foreign cable concerns still operate in the United       Kingdom,  and the Anglo-Continental Telegraph services are operated by the       G.P.O.  in the United Kingdom.  Nor was C. &amp; W. Ltd. given the right to       participate in the  development of  overseas telephone  services from the       United Kingdom.           (iv) The organisation of the merger companies has not proved altogether       satisfactory.  The holding Company, C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd., was over capitalised.       It  has been unable to pay the full dividend on its Cumulative Preference       Stock and has paid no  dividend on its &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B &quot;  Ordinary Stock.       These difficulties of C.  &amp; W.  (H)  Ltd.  have  no doubt  reacted  on the       communications policy of C. &amp; W. Ltd.           (v) C.  &amp; W. Ltd. has had only a leasehold tenure of the  Beam services       from the  United  Kingdom  and has been under obligation to  maintain       the cable system required for strategic and other purposes, so that wireless       development has been impeded.           (vi) The Standard Revenue scheme has been inoperative.    60. A possible solution of some of these difficulties might be  sought in theacquisition of  the system  by the State.  The problem of co-ordinating telephone,telegraph  and air mail could thus be more easily handled.   Responsibility forupkeep would fall on the tax-payer and not on the private  shareholder and theinroads of foreign competition might thus be more easily met.  But such a solution is open to the Governments at any time  if the necessary  legislation could  be  (C24174)                                                                 c 3
obtained.  The terms of acquisition would presumably be settled by arbitration,the result of which  cannot be foreseen but might involve the  Governments  in heavy payments  for compensation.   Operation would not necessarily  be  more efficient and might be more expensive, and the problem of dealing with assets in foreign countries  and the necessity  for co-operation  between the  ImperialGovernments would remain.    61. A possible form of State ownership would be to organise communications in the hands of an Imperial Public Utility Board jointly constituted by the ImperialGovernments with a complete  monopoly, on the lines considered by the GreeneCommittee.   There would  then be complete participation by the Dominions andIndia in the Imperial scheme, thus giving real unity of control and other advantages.We agree with the  Greene Committee, however,  that such a scheme,  with therelinquishment of sovereignty by the Imperial Governments which it implies, is outside practical politics.    62. The basis of the 1928 merger scheme was the free association of the ImperialGovernments in support of a  system .of  overseas telegraph services owned and operated  by  private  enterprise.  Notwithstanding  the  catastrophic  world conditions under which it has had to operate, this scheme has  so far achieved its main  objects.  It is  still faced  with grave difficulties, but these difficulties do notappear insuperable, and we can see no practicable alternative which offers a betterprospect of success.   We  conclude, therefore,  that this basis of the 1928 scheme should be retained.   If this system is to  operate successfully, however, it must be soorganised that it can offer in every country of the Empire a rapid and  sufficientservice at a competitive tariff.  For this purpose co-operation between C. &amp; W.Ltd.  and the other  undertakings and  Governments concerned throughout theEmpire should be improved.  C. &amp; W.  Ltd. should be given the  greatest possiblefreedom to operate on a commercial basis, and &quot; non-commercial &quot; obligations and charges imposed by the Governments should  be reduced. Whenever practicablethe Governments should facilitate the acquisition of further services by C. &amp; W.Ltd.  which  may complete the  unity of the Imperial telegraph  scheme.  Everyeffort should be made to avoid the introduction of new  routes or services whichmay withdraw traffic from the Company&apos;s system.    63. If practical steps  can be  taken to achieve  these objects, we think that. &amp;  W. Ltd. and its associated and subsidiary companies can  reasonably hope to consolidate their  position, so that this essential Imperial service  can  be main-tained without recourse to Government ownership or Government subsidies.  Wehave  framed the recommendations which follow with these  objects  in view.                THE  COMMITTEES  RECOMMENDATIONS    64. We have examined in close consultation with C. &amp; W. Ltd. the six points raised by the Company in  May last and other matters which have been brought before us, and we have jointly framed a scheme which we have agreed to recommend to the  Governments and which  the Directors of  C. &amp; W.  Ltd.  are prepared toaccept.
             RECOMMENDATION  (1)-THE BEAM  RENTAL    65. (a) H.M. Government in the United Kingdom to cancel the rental of  250,000per annum plus  12 per cent, of surplus profits now payable by C.  &amp; W. Ltd. to  thePostmaster-General in the United Kingdom for the lease to 1953 of the Beam wireless stations in the United Kingdom.  C. &amp; W. Ltd. to be given the freehold of the Stations,an extension of its licence, and two further concessions ;            (i) C.  &amp; W. Ltd. to be granted free land lines equivalent to any land lines       to existing Beam stations which may be dispensed with on reorganisation.           (ii) The Postmaster-General in  the  United Kingdom to waive a claim      for a capital payment of  35,000 by C. &amp; W. Ltd. for the transfer of the Kenya       wireless service to the Company in 1930.    (b) In consideration of these concessions, 3,000,000  1 shares in C. &amp; W. Ltd.to be transferred  to H.M.  Government in the United Kingdom ; these  shares to befound from the existing capital of C.  &amp; W.  Ltd.  by  agreement between the parties concerned.    66. One of the six points submitted by C. &amp; W. Ltd. in May last was that  theBeam  Rental was too onerous a burden upon the resources of the Company andshould be abolished.    67. The  Beam stations in the United Kingdom were erected for the BritishPost Office by the  Marconi Company in 1926/27 for a contract price of about 160,000.  In the 1928 negotiations,  the  merger companies  originally desired toacquire the freehold of the Beam stations, but agreed eventually to accept a leaseconveying the use of the Beam wireless assets for 25 years until  1953, when theywere to be handed  back  in  good condition to the  Postmaster-General.   TheCompany obtained at the same  time  a licence to operate the Beam services,  butthis licence was  not exclusive.    68. Obviously, the Beam Rental had no relation to the cost or value of  the physical assets.  The British Post Office was making an annual profit of approxi-mately  250,000 from the operation of the Beam services in  1928, and, after these services were transferred to private enterprise, desired to be left in exactly the samefinancial position as before. The Post Office accordingly wished to be guaranteedan annual payment of  250,000.  It also claimed to have a share in the additionalprofits which might accrue from further development of the combined undertaking.An additional rental of 12 per cent,  of any surplus earnings over and above  theStandard Revenue was agreed for this purpose    69. C. &amp; W. Ltd. has no legal  claim for  a reduction  of the Beam Rental.There  are strong objections to the reconsideration of such a  contract,  and there isno doubt as to the ability of the Companies to meet the payment.  The rental of 250,000 is an operating  expense and on the basis of C.  &amp; W. Ltd. accounts for1934 and 1935, the Company has an earning capacity of over  800,000 per annumafter meeting this payment. Moreover, the payment is guaranteed by the holding company which has very considerable resources.  The Beam Rental of   250,000per annum is payable by quarterly instalments which began on 1st April, 1928,  and payment  has been duly made up to and including the quarterly payment due on1st January,  1937.  There is no prospect of any additional rental becoming payableout of excess revenue above the standard.    70. What then are the grounds on which this liability  can  be reconsidered ?In our view, these grounds can only be found in the harmful effects of this arrange-ment on the Company&apos;s policy, the close relations between the Company and the  (C24174)                                                                c 4
British Post Office which a new arrangement should secure, and, finally, the generalbenefit to the communications services which are the joint interest of the ImperialGovernments.           (i) The holding of the Beam stations by C. &amp; W. Ltd. on  a lease basis      impedes the real amalgamation of the cable and wireless services.  There is a      natural tendency to maintain a network of cables which will form a workable      system  after 1953, even if the Beam wireless services are taken back by the      State.  Moreover, lease tenure of the actual stations prevents reorganisation      of the wireless services in the United Kingdom.   New services cannot easily      be installed in the Beam stations which may have to be handed back to the      Postmaster-General in 1953, and  no reorganisation scheme which would      dispense with any of the  Beam stations can be considered.  The grant to      C. &amp; W. Ltd. of the freehold of the Beam stations would be a considerable      advantage.           (ii) The traffic on the Beam wireless services was mainly traffic diverted      from the old Cable Companies.  If, by the payment of Beam Rental, the      value of this  diverted traffic remains deducted from the revenue  of the      merger  system, it must be to the  disadvantage of the telegraph user, and      forms a precedent for other payments to  Governments which are not pay-      ments for services rendered.           (iii) The same  objections do  not apply to Government  participation      in profits which otherwise would  be  taken by private shareholders.  The      true relation between  the State and  the Company is one of partnership.      It is accordingly suggested that a fair basis for the transfer  of the Beam      stations to the Company would be an allocation of shares to  His Majesty&apos;s      Government  ranking pcwi passu  in  all respects  with  the shares of the      Company.           (iv) There are  obvious objections to increasing the capital of C. &amp; W.      Ltd., if it can be  avoided.  This capital should be reduced rather than      increased.   It therefore appears reasonable  that  any share consideration      to be given to the British Government in respect of the Beam Rental should      be taken out of  the existing Company&apos;s capital of  30,000,000, which is all      held, within the group, by the old Cable  Companies and  the  Marconi      Company.           (v) An arrangement  on these lines would be a substantial concession      to the  Company by  the  Government.   The Company would be relieved      of an operating  charge of  250,000  a year and the Government would      accept in return shares of the Company  giving a yield dependent on the      Company&apos;s future profits.        In our negotiations three further points have been raised :            (a) Under an agreement of 4th  September, 1929, between the  Post-      master-General  in  the United  Kingdom and C. &amp; W. Ltd.,  the Company      is given the benefit of free landline circuits between the Beam stations and      the  Central Telegraph Office as part consideration  for the Beam  Rental.      The Company asks  that in the event of any of these free land lines becoming      unnecessary on  reorganisation of  the stations, it should be given a free      landline equivalent elsewhere.   We think such a concession  is reasonable      if the Company is given the freehold of the Beam stations.           (b)  C. &amp; W.  Ltd. has also called attention to a claim by the General Post      Office in the United Kingdom against the Company for a payment of   35,000      which the Company agreed to make in 1930 as compensation to the  General      Post Office for loss of revenue on the transfer to C. &amp; W. Ltd. of the Kenya      Radio Service.  In the final terms of transfer, the Post Office agreed to      consider acceptance of a reduced  amount, but no further action has been      taken, and the claim is still outstanding.  The grounds for reconsideration are
      that the transfer obliged the  Company to erect  costly plant, and at  the      same time to reduce the tariff between Kenya and the United  Kingdom,      and thus to diminish the revenue of the cable circuits which had previously      carried the traffic.  In the present financial position of the Company, it is      desirable as a matter of general principle that the Governments should  not      levy payments to be made out of telegraph revenues, other than in respect      of services rendered, and we suggest that this long standing claim should      now be cancelled in part  consideration of the allocation  of  shares  to      H.M. Government in the United Kingdom which we now recommend.   At      the same time, a small counter claim of  750 by C. &amp; W.  Ltd. should also      be waived.           (c) The Company has claimed that if the above arrangements are made      it is reasonably  entitled to a  continuance after 1953 of its licence for  the      Beam  Wireless services from  the United Kingdom.  We recommend that      the Company&apos;s licence from the Postmaster-General in the United Kingdom      should be extended to  cover a period of 25 years from the date when  the      revised arrangements come  into force, and should remain effective after      that date  unless and until  action is taken by the Postmaster-General to      withdraw or modify such licence.    71.  We think it is implicit in our proposals  that  C.  &amp; W.  Ltd. can expect to retain  its licence after  1953 subject  to  mutually satisfactory arrangements being made between the  Postmaster-General in  the  United Kingdom and  theCompany, but we do not consider that  a binding undertaking  to  continue  thelicence is either desirable or practicable.  Though the licence conveys no monopolyto C.  &amp; W. Ltd., its terms may require adjustment from time to time in view of developments in communications technique.  The Government cannot be expectedto fetter its powers by giving the  Company a perpetual licence, and should  not become  liable to damages if for any reason it should decide to withdraw the licence.    72.  Taking into account all the  above considerations, and also the arrangements which we propose should be made by the  Company in the matter  of the StandardRevenue and the revision of the Rate Schedule, we have agreed to recommend theallocation  of 3,000,000   1 shares to the British  Government out of the existing capital  of C. &amp; WT. Ltd. as a fair and reasonable  settlement which the company is prepared to accept as part of the agreed scheme.RECOMMENDATION (2)-THE STANDARD REVENUE OF C. &amp;  W.  LTD.    73-.  Instead  of the  present  Standard Revenue arrangement C. &amp; W.  Ltd. to beentitled out of the  balance of earnings  of the Company available for dividend in eachyear to pay a basic dividend not exceeding 4 per cent, on the capital of  30,000,000(including the   3,000,000 share capital to  be allocated to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom), any surplus earnings to be divided as to one-half to  the general purposes of the Company (including  additional dividends), and as to one-half to aSpecial  Account to be earmarked and applied forthwith to the reduction of rates to orfrom Imperial points or to the improvement of Imperial services.    74.  The basis of the Company&apos;s claims in M.policy last was the failure to  earn itsStandard  Revenue.  The Standard  Revenue was fixed by the  1928 conference as the normal amount which the Company might appropriate out of profits without question to its own purposes.   The Governments in no way guaranteed that  theCompany would be able to earn the Standard Revenue and have  no obligation tomake up the Company&apos;s earnings to  the figure when they fall short of it.   If  theStandard Revenue was reached, 12 per cent, of profits above the Standard wasallocated to additional  Beam Rental, and the balance was to be divided, one-half
to the general purposes of the Company, and one-half to the reduction of ratesand development of the  services under  schemes  approved by the  AdvisoryCommittee.    75. Under the provisions of the Third Schedule to the Treasury Agreementtwo items which  total  142,730 are deducted from profits instead of being addedto the standard figure so that the Standard Revenue of  1,865,000 corresponds to an effective net revenue on the Company&apos;s Revenue Account, of over  2,000,000.        The Standard Revenue figure was built up in 1928 from            (a) the actual known  revenues of the  old Cable Companies (which       accounted  for the bulk of the amount).           (b) a sum for anticipated savings which  the Cable Companies claimed       would come into operation even if the merger did not eventuate.           (c) the anticipated revenues of the Marconi Wireless services.           id) a calculated figure for the earnings of the Government cables taken       over by the Company.    76. The revenue from the Beam services did not  enter into the calculation,as this figure was set off against  Beam Rental;  nor was the Standard fixed by reference to the capitalisation.    77. The Compa.ny&apos;s earnings have never been  near to  the  Standard figure.The extent of the world trade depression in 1930 and onwards and the  extent ofthe growth  of foreign competition could not have  been foreseen in  1928.   Themost conservative standard which could have been fixed in the light of the informa-tion then available must have far exceeded the subsequent earnings of the Company.    78. Nevertheless, as the  Greene Committee recognised, the fixing  of theStandard Revenue at this figure has had unfortunate reactions on the policy of theCompany.  Attempting to raise revenue to this Standard, the Company  proposed a 75 per cent, increase in Empire rates in 1931, which led to the appointment of theGreene Committee of Inquiry.  Since that time the  failure to reach the  StandardRevenue is the Company&apos;s general  answer to claims for reduction of rates.    79. Moreover, it is this figure of &quot; free &quot; earnings from communications whichis used to justify the capitalisation of the Holding  Company, C. &amp; W.  (H) Ltd.As long as  this figure stands it is difficult to persuade the public shareholders ofC. &amp; W. (H) Ltd.  of the need for a reconstruction of the capital of that Company.    80. The writing down of the Standard Revenue of C. &amp; W. Ltd. is thus of real importance.  To the shareholders this means a sacrifice, at least of anticipationsof future dividends.  But in the long run C. &amp; W. Ltd.  must  benefit if all  partiescan agree, having regard to present day conditions,  what is  the level of earningswhich the Company may appropriate, without question to its own purposes, as areasonable return on the capital.   It must be clear,  however, that this  return isnot guaranteed by the Governments, and can only  be earned by the Company&apos;sown efforts and economies.   The reduction of the Standard Revenue has  a furthersignificance.  This figure  sets a limit to the amount which the shareholder maydraw  from  the Company&apos;s  earnings without making immediate provision for theinterests  of the telegraph user.  If the Company&apos;s earnings improve as the resultof an increase of international traffic or an adjustment of rates, the public shouldultimately have a share  in this betterment.   The  main interest of the british public is in the reduction of rates on the Imperial  system, and this would naturally be the main object to which surplus earnings of  the Company should be applied.There might also be certain cases, particularly in the smaller Colonies, where newservices could be introduced if financial assistance were forthcoming to cover losses in the initial period.
    81.  We have given careful consideration to the basis on which a revision ofthe Standard Revenue might be carried out:            (a) The  Third  Schedule  to  the  Treasury  Agreement contains  a      complicated  scheme for ascertaining  the  net  revenue of the  Company,      which involves a difficult and prolonged accountancy examination every      year whether or not the Standard Revenue has been reached.  Some simpler      basis is clearly necessary.   We have, therefore, preferred to fix a Basic      Dividend figure instead of a Standard Revenue.           (b) At present, profits above the  Standard,  after meeting  additional      Beam Rental, are to  be divided half to the Company and half to rate      reductions, etc.  The shareholders would prefer a larger share available for      dividends.  The  user would prefer that all profits above a fixed limit should      go back into the  business. It seems to us that a wholly fixed dividend would      be unfair to  the shareholder  and that the present half and half division      should be retained.           (c)  In estimating  the effect of  a Basic Dividend figure  of 4 per cent.      account must be taken of the reduction of the shareholding in C. &amp; W. Ltd.      retained by the existing group from  30,000,000 to  27,000,000 (para. 65 (b)      above).  This means  that a  4  per cent,  dividend returns  to  the  group       1,080,000, which is little more than half the profits required by the original      standard.  The  earning capacity of C. &amp; W. Ltd. in 1934 and  1935, with      the  addition  of  the  Beam Rental payment, was  about   1,075,000.  This      figure compares  with the profit of  1,200,000 required to give a dividend of      4 per cent, on the total capital of  30,000,000.           (d) We have  also considered what safeguards are required  to  ensure      the proper appropriation of net revenue under the Basic  Dividend scheme      and the application  of moneys earmarked for rate reductions, etc.,  in the      Special Account in view of the revised arrangements with  regard  to the      Board and the Advisory Committee which we recommend below :-             (i) We suggest  that there should not be a  separate adjustment of         profits  for the purpose of  the Basic Dividend scheme, but that effect         should be given to this scheme in the published accounts. The ascertain-         ment of profit should be ieft to the directors and auditors, subject to         general  directions with regard to the treatment of items  chargeable to         revenue, the definition of renewals and the treatment of income tax.  The         appropriation out  of the profits for  the year for dividend or other general         purposes should be  limited  to a sum equal to 4 per cent, on the paid-up         Share Capital plus 50 per cent, of any profit in excess of such sum, and the         remaining  50  per  cent, of any excess should  be transferred to a Special         Account subject to deduction of income tax.  Any sum thus appropriated         for dividend or other general purposes, but not utilised, should be available         for dividend in subsequent years without restriction.  Any balance standing         to the credit of Income Tax Account in excess of the Company&apos;s liability         (which may arise, e.g., from the unexhausted wear and tear  allowances         carried forward referred to in para. 55 above), might be utilised in paying         dividends up to 4 per cent, in respect of any year when the available profit,         including any balance brought forward from previous years, is insufficient         to pay 4 per cent.             (ii)  We also suggest that  the application of surplus profit earmarked         for rate reductions, etc., in the Special Account  should  rest with the         reconstituted Board of C.  &amp; W. Ltd.,  subject, however,  to an  annual         report  by  the Directors showing how, and to  what effect, the moneys         have been applied, together  with a statement  of the  Special Account
         certified  by the  Company&apos;s auditors.   The Governments  should be         empowered to  require  any  reasonable  additional  information  to be         rendered by the Company and to make representations to the Company as         to the future application of the account.              RECOMMENDATION  (3)-STRATEGIC CABLES    82. The Imperial Governments to agree in principle that C.  &amp; W. Ltd. should begiven  compensation by the Governments concerned for any expense  or loss of revenueincurred in respect of cables  not required for commercial purposes which the company is prepared to abandon, but which the Governments decide must be retained for strategicpurposes.   The basis of compensation and the  arrangements  to be made for &quot; care and maintenance &quot; of the strategic cables to be  settled by the Governments after an enquiry which  we  suggest should be initiated forthwith by the Committee of ImperialDefence.    83. Under the  Treasury  Agreement,  C.  &amp;  W.  Ltd.  is charged with themaintenance of the cable system, including cables of vital strategic importancein the scheme  of Imperial defence, since the  wireless circuits are not held to affordsufficient secrecy  in time of emergency. In  view of the benefits thus accruing tothe Imperial Governments the Company has claimed that some  contribution shouldbe made by the Governments towards the cost of upkeep.    84. We observed in our last Report that  no representations had  been madeto us  at that time that the Company maintained any cables which  it did not require  for its own commercial  purposes ; so that the case made  to  us  wassimply a general  claim  that the Company performed a public service by main-taihing the cable system and should be paid for doing so.   In the subsequent discussions with the Company no method has been suggested to us for computingthe amount of  the contribution to be made to the Company under this proposal orfor  allocating  the contribution between the  interested Governments.   It  was argued that both at home and abroad C.  &amp; W. Ltd. has to face competition from subsidised competitors, and was therefore reasonably entitled to a government contribution towards the upkeep of the strategic cables.    85. We found it difficult to deal with a claim made on this general basis, andwe accordingly put two questions to the Company.  First,, we enquired what cables,if any, were now being maintained which had either no commercial value or such alimited commercial value that  the Company would desire to abandon them  if itwere not obliged to maintain them by reason of its obligations  under the TreasuryAgreement.  Secondly, we  recalled that, in 1932, after the Greene  Committee&apos;sReport, the Company had put forward a scheme for supersession by wireless  of alarge number of cable routes. This scheme, which is printed as Appendix IV to theCommittee&apos;s Report of July, 1932 (Paper No. 7-B), set out:            (a)  A list of strategic cables in respect of which the Advisory  Committee      had given authority  for supersession (2,034 nautical miles) ;           (b)  a list of non-strategic cables in respect of  which the Advisory      Committee had given authority for supersession (11,436 nautical miles) ;           (c)  a list of strategic cables in respect of which authority for supersession      might be sought from the Advisory Committee (19,010 nautical miles) ;           (d)  a list of non-strategic cables in respect of which authority for super-      session  might be sought from the Advisory Committee  (17,482 nautical      miles) ;          (e)  a list of strategic  cables in respect of which the Advisory Committee      had refused authority for supersession  (4,062 nautical miles).
                                                                       e&amp; t* t*    86. This scheme outlined a future policy, but neither at that time nor since had . &amp; W. Ltd. put forward a specific request for the abandonment of any individualcable under the scheme.  We accordingly inquired if there was any likelihood of thisscheme being revived.    87. In answer to these questions the  Company stated that it would still wishto abandon the following strategic cables included in the list in para. 85 (e) above :-            Singapore-Labuan (738 nautical  miles).            Singapore-Banjoewangie (939 nautical miles).            Banjoewangie-Port Darwin  2 (1,145 nautical miles).But this  was the only extent to which the Company  proposed  abandonment ofcables.    88. If these are the facts it appears that up to the present the obligation tomaintain  the cable system  which was imposed on  the Company by the 1929Agreement has not been onerous.  Some 80,000 nautical miles of cable or about halfthe Company&apos;s system was originally classed as strategic.  In the past, on application made by  the Company, consent has been freely given by the Advisory Committeeto the abandonment of a number  of cables, including some previously classed asstrategic  ;  and in the only instance where consent has been refused the financial effect was not considerable.   The expenditure on repairs and renewals in the period1930-1935, for the three cables above  mentioned which it  is desired to abandon,was about  15,700 p.a.  Similar expenditure for 1937 is estimated at   27,800,  anda total expenditure of  68,000 on  repairs and renewals is anticipated during the4 years 1938-41.   The residual value of these cables is about  52,000 after deducting 33,000 for cost of recovery, handling and reconditioning.    89. We do not consider  that the Company&apos;s claim for a contribution from theGovernments for the general upkeep of the cable system can be maintained.  If this claim is analysed it means that overseas telegraph communications can only be run on a  subsidy basis,  and this we do not accept.    90. Nevertheless the maintenance  of the Company&apos;s world-wide  cable system in one hand and  under British control is undoubtedly of vital importance to imperial  defence from the  intelligence aspect ;  and individual cables  may formessential links in the communications required by  the Empire in time of emergency.    91. We think that these reasons justify the  general co-operation and supportof the Imperial Governments, which we recommend in other sections of this report,and  that  with regard to the individual  cables classed as necessary  for strategicpurposes some further assistance to the Company is  required.    92. Under the present arrangements, so long  as the cables must be maintained at the cost of the Company, there is little incentive to the Governments to cutdown their strategic requirements. So long as the  Company know that there is little  likelihood  of any important cables  being released  they  must  base theirpolicy on the retention of cables rather than the  development of wireless.  In thelong run the overseas telegraphs cannot be successfully operated as a business under-taking unless the business is free to choose the cheapest and most efficient methodsof communication and cannot be accused, however unjustly, of imposing high rates on the consumer in order to maintain an  out-of-date system required for strategic and not commercial purposes.    93. Under Clause 21 of the Treasury Agreement, the Company is required tocomply with the directions of the Partner Governments for the purpose of safe-guarding  strategical requirements, provided that &quot; if the  Company shall satisfy
the Advisory Committee that compliance with any such directions would involvethe Company in any substantial expense or loss of revenue, the Company shall as acondition of compliance be entitled to be reimbursed for such expense or loss ofrevenue.&quot;  This clause we understand applies only to new strategic  requirements and not to those which were obviously in existence at the time when the agreement was signed.  The Greene Committee recommended that where the  maintenance ofany particular  line of communication is required  for strategic and  not for com-mercial purposes, any loss involved should be met by the State ;  and, consequently,that Clause 21 of the Treasury Agreement should be made applicable to all strategic requirements, irrespective of date, and that  arbitration  should be allowed if  theAdvisory Committee  and  the Company failed to. reach  agreement as  to the cost involved (Greene Report, para. 86).    94. In our Report of July, 1932, we put forward a suggested basis for computingthe subsidy in  such a case.   It was  considered that cables which the Companydesired to abandon  but  which the Governments  required  for strategic  reasonsmight  be placed on a &quot; care and  maintenance basis,&quot; and  that  the  calculation of subsidy applicable to  cables no longer  required for commercial purposes and placed under &quot; care and maintenance &quot; should take into account the circumstancesof each particular case and should cover           (a)  the cost of maintaining and renewing the cable sections  concerned ;          (b)  the cost incurred at stations in connection with the  care and main-       tenance of instruments, etc., required for strategic cables ;          (c) the estimated loss of interest to the Company through non-realisation       of assets in consequence of  Government intervention.    95. A Sub-Committee of the Imperial  Communications Committee of  theCommittee of Imperial Defence appointed in  1932  made certain recommendations with regard to the application of the &quot; care and maintenance &quot; basis  to particularcables  ; but in the absence of any specific application  by the Company for  theabandonment of cables no further action has  been taken and no decision has beenmade by the Governments on the question whether or not a subsidy should be given.    96. We find it hard to question the fairness of the principle that the cost of strategic requirements should be met  by the  State and not by the shareholder orthe telegraph user.  It might be argued that the Company accepted the obligationto maintain the strategic  cables under the Treasury Agreement and must standby their bargain.  We do not  think,  however, that the full implications of this obligation are apparent on the face of the Treasury Agreement, or  that they wererealised by the Company in 1928.   Again it might  be said that there  are practicaldifficulties in carrying out the principle.  Can the cost of particular cable sectionsbe isolated from the system as a whole  ?   Might not the Company be able to switchtraffic  away from any particular cable route and then  claim that  this  route is&quot; non-commercial &quot; and must be  maintained by  the Governments  ?  Would it not be difficult  for the Governments to deal  with  claims when the Company hasall the information about  costs and traffics in its  own hands ?  How would thecost be apportioned between the  Governments ?   Such difficulties, we believe,would  either not  arise  at all in  practice  or  could be easily  solved  in anyconcrete case :           (i) If the Company is prepared to abandon a cable section, such,  for       example,  as the Singapore-Port Darwin cables, the  section can obviously       be segregated from the general  system.          (ii) A Company  of standing  is  not   likely  to put  forward unfair       claims, but there is a further safeguard in the presence of additional approved       Directors on the Board which we recommend below.
          (iii) The Governments have power to require  full investigation and      disclosure on every claim ;  and subject to the principle of compensation      being agreed,  we  would  regard it as  reasonable in this matter  for  the      Governments to have the final decision as to the amount of compensation      payable in any particular case, without recourse to arbitration in the event      of dispute.          (iv) The application of  the &quot; care and  maintenance &quot;  basis  should      obviate any risk that the ordinary upkeep of the Company&apos;s  system could      be transferred to the Governments.          (v) The method  we  have suggested for  computing compensation to      the Company is  a fair  and simple one.  Apportionment  of liability for      compensation between the Governments interested is no more difficult than      it was to apportion the joint liabilities undertaken in respect  of the Pacific      Cable Board undertaking.          (vi)  It would be  a necessary corollary of  such an arrangement that      in the  event of the  &quot; care and  maintenance &quot;  cables being utilised by      C. &amp; W. Ltd. for  its own purposes, e.g., for an alternative  traffic route on      a breakdown elsewhere,  the  value  of  the  traffic would be deducted from      the subsidy payable.    97.  If the principle of  compensation  is  accepted by the Governments, wesuggest that the method of computing the payment, the application of the &quot; care and maintenance &quot; basis, and the list of strategic  cables required to be maintained,should be examined by the  Committee of Imperial Defence.   We  should be glad,if desired, to assist in this enquiry, and to obtain  any further information required from C.  &amp; W. Ltd.   RECOMMENDATION (4)-OVERSEAS COMMUNICATIONS  SERVICES   (TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE) OPERATED BY THE  GENERAL               POST OFFICE IN THE UNITED  KINGDOM.    98. (a)  The  Committee  considers  that,  in general principle,  the  overseascommunications services  (telegraph  and  telephone) conducted by the General PostOffice in the United Kingdom should be  brought into close  relation with the servicesoperated by C. &amp; W. Ltd.    (b) With regard to the specific services :            (i) Anglo-Continental Telegraph Services           The Committee recommends  that negotiations should be  opened at once       between the G.P.O. in the  United  Kingdom and C.  &amp;  W. Ltd. to formulate       a scheme for the transfer of the G.P.O. Anglo-Continental telegraph services to       C.  &amp; W. Ltd.  on  a financial basis  mutually acceptable, or,  failing this,  to       co-ordinate the services under  a working arrangement on joint purse lines.           (ii) Overseas  Telephone from  the United Kingdom.           The possibility of closer relations between the G.P.O.  overseas  telephone       services and the overseas telegraphs should be kept  under review, but the time does       not appear to be ripe for any immediate steps to be taken, and the Committee       makes no recommendation.           (iii) G.P.O. Radiotelegraph service with ships at sea.           The position with regard to this service should be kept under review, but       the Committee makes  no recommendation.
                  ANGLO-CONTINENTAL TELEGRAPH SERVICES     99. The telegraph service between the United Kingdom  and the continent of Europe is handled at the British end by three parties, the  British Post Office(referred to below as the G.P.O.), C. &amp;  W. Ltd., and the Great Northern TelegraphCo., a Danish Company with which C.  &amp; W. Ltd. is closely associated.   The G.P.O.services carry about 60 million words annually with the  Continent (terminal  and transit), and C. &amp; W. Ltd. nearly 41  millions.  The bulk of the transit traffic iscarried by C. &amp; W. Ltd.,  but the Company&apos;s terminal traffic with the continentis only about one-third of that carried by G.P.O.    100. Most of the G.P.O. traffic  is carried  on short submarine cables  jointlyowned by the G.P.O. and the respective Continental Administrations under arrange-ments governed by conventions between the two parties.   Circuits on these cablesfor transit traffic with France are leased to C. &amp; W. Ltd., and circuits with Holland,Germany and Belgium (for transatlantic traffic) are leased to the Western union and Commercial Cable Companies.   The G.P.O. has direct telegraph services overthe cables  from London  to the principal  towns in France, Italy,  Switzerland,Holland, Belgium,  Germany, Czechoslovakia,  Austria, and  Norway.  There arealso G.P.O. services from Liverpool to  Paris, Havre,  Antwerp, and Rotterdam andfrom the London Stock Exchange to the Continental Bourses.  To supplement the cable and landline services the  G.P.O.  operates wireless  circuits with the more distant countries, namely, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia,Roumania and Danzig.   101. This telegraph business  with  the Continent was  built up by the  G.P.O.many years ago mainly with the near neighbours of this country across the Channelas an extension of the British Inland  Telegraph system in which  the short cablelink was of small  account.  The Cable Companies now merged in C. &amp; W.  Ltd.mainly served Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean countries ;  and denmark and Sweden were served by the cables  laid by the Great Northern Company.   but some time  prior to the merger, the Marconi Company was given permission toestablish wireless  services with  France, Switzerland, Russia,  Austria, Bulgaria,Serbia, Denmark, Sweden, Finland,  Greece, Spain, Portugal,  and Turkey.  In thecase of the  first six of these countries,  which had previously been served solely bythe Government cables, the Marconi  Company was required to pay the  BritishPost Office a royalty to compensate partially for the loss to the Government cables.This royalty which is still  paid by C. &amp; W. Ltd. now amounts to about  14,500a year.   102. Thus C. &amp; W. Ltd. is now excluded  from  giving a terminal telegraphservice with certain Continental countries including Germany, Holland and Belgium.C. &amp; W. Ltd. directly competes  with the G.P.O. services mainly in France,Switzerland, Austria and Italy, but to a lesser degree in the other countries wherethe Company has wireless circuits.   103. Between  the  Great Northern Company and C.  &amp;  W. Ltd. there is nocompetition.   Though licensed to do so, C.  &amp; W. Ltd. has established no wirelesscircuit with Denmark, Sweden and Finland, which are served by the Great Northern.The two companies have a close association for collection and  delivery of traffic in the U.K.  and in Europe, and negotiations for a joint purse for European traffic between the Companies have reached an advanced stage.   104. The Anglo-Continental telegraph rates are very low.  Sixty per cent, of theG.P.O. traffic is with France, Belgium, Holland and Norway, where  the full rateis only 2\d. a word, and 30 per cent,  to Germany,  Switzerland and  Italy, wherethe rate is  3d. a word.  After deducting the Government terminals  at each  endthere is thus a very small margin to cover transmission.   Some seven years  ago
the G.P.O. services were profitable, but during recent years they have been run ata loss,  though a small profit is expected for 1935-36.   The services are, however,of value to the G.P.O. as making a substantial contribution to overhead costs onthe general inland system in the U.K.  In recent years the volume of the G.P.O.traffic has dropped considerably, and, owing to the short distances, the telegraphsare here  subject to the full force of competition from telephone  and air mail.With the extension of Telex services and&apos;  the use  of  telegraph channels  on the telephone cables, these services to the Continent are likely to become more  andmore inter-connected from the technical side.     105.  During our  negotiations, C. &amp; W. Ltd. asked that  it should be allowedto take over the G.P.O. Continental services on financial terms to be mutually agreed, the intention being that the financial position of the parties should remain unchanged as the result of the transaction, so that C. &amp; W. Ltd. would have to bepaid if  it took over a losing service and vice versa.  The Company also asked thatit  should be relieved of its royalty payments  for its  continental services tothe  G.P.O.     106.  It  was not suggested that  C. &amp; W. Ltd. could make these claims as of right, but that the transfer would greatly strengthen the position of the Company,that it would be to the advantage of the public user and that it would facilitateco-operation  between the Company and the G.P.O.     107.  As the Greene Committee recognised, it appears at first sight logical andattractive to take this step to  round off  the 1928 merger by giving C. &amp; W. Ltd.control as far as possible of all overseas telegraph services in the Empire :           (i)  If C. &amp; W. Ltd. operated  the terminals of  the G.P.O.,  Anglo-      Continental  Telegraph services and  could use its Continental circuits for      all traffic without restriction, it would  become  the only British overseas      telegraphic carrier giving universal service.  It  would have the advantage      of  handling a large new volume of  terminal traffic and would be  greatly      strengthened in building up its international transit traffic to and from the      Continent.   It would have a stronger position in competing with the U.S.A.      companies operating in the U.K., and additional prestige and influence, which      would facilitate canvassing and publicity generally.          (ii) The public would have the advantage of an unrestricted  service      by the  Company&apos;s offices to and from all parts of the world.  Alternative      routes would  facilitate the handling  of Anglo-Continental  traffic, which      could also be dealt  with by the Company in  the U.K. with a speed, which      is more difficult to obtain when it is transmitted by the G.P.O. with the large      mass of inland traffic. Imperial traffic with countries now served exclusively      by the G.P.O. would be  expedited and facilitated.          (iii) Direct competition between the Company and one of the Imperial      Governments is clearly undesirable, even in  a sphere where C. &amp;  W. Ltd.,      is  to some  extent  the  newcomer in a  long-established service.  For the      Anglo-Continental services  both G.P.O. and C. &amp; W. Ltd. employ can-      vassers and there is a risk of friction.   There must be some overlapping of      services which &quot; rationalisation &quot; would avoid.     108.  On the other hand, there are various advantages to the G.P.O. in controllingthese services.  It is difficult to see how  the G.P.O. part ownership of the cross-Channel cables could be transferred ; substantial expenditure might be involved ifC. &amp; W. Ltd. had to set up elsewhere the  wireless  plant now at  St.  Albansand  Leafield ; and the displacement and compensation of G.P.O. staff would be a  (C 24174)                                                                  D
further problem.  Much of the present G.P.O. traffic is social traffic widely spread,which  would still be handled by the  local post offices in the United Kingdom,and  so long as this traffic goes via the Central Telegraph Office, and thence toC. &amp; W. Ltd. headquarters, a double handling is involved which means additionalexpense.   If C. &amp; W. Ltd. ran the services at a loss there would be a risk  of a claim for increased rates.     109.  It appears to us, however, that most of these difficulties could be adjusted.For example, the difficulty over double handling would not arise if, as we understandis possible, direct switching of traffic could be arranged between the various postoffices in the United Kingdom and the head office of C. &amp; W. Ltd. instead of via the Central Telegraph Office ;  and would be avoided in any case in respect of traffic which could be  collected and delivered direct by the  Company&apos;s offices  in theUnited Kingdom.  The  Company claim that most of the  traffic could be so dealtwith.  We can see no reason why C. &amp; W. Ltd. should not run the services equallyas well as the G.P.O. in most ways and with some advantage  in point of speed.Having regard, therefore, to the considerable advantages to the Company, thetransfer of the operation of these services to C. &amp; W. Ltd. appears to be desirableif a practicable scheme can be framed.   In the absence  of a detailed accountancyinvestigation it is not possible for us to make any  suggestion as to the  terms  of transfer.   If, however, transfer cannot be arranged on terms which are mutuallysatisfactory we still  think that  some steps should be taken to rationalise thesecompeting services. If a working agreement on joint purse lines is desirable betweenC. &amp; W. Ltd. and the Great  Northern Co., it should be equally so between theG.P.O. and C. &amp; W. Ltd.  We trust, therefore, that  failing transfer, a joint purseagreement can be concluded between these two parties.   In any such arrangements the position of the Great Northern would no doubt be taken into account;  and itmight also be considered whether, having regard to present-day conditions, theroyalty payable by C.  &amp; W.  Ltd. to the  G.P.O. in respect of its  Continentalservices could be waived.          OVERSEAS TELEPHONE SERVICES  IN  THE UNITED  KINGDOM    110. It was one of the six points made to us by C. &amp; W. Ltd. in May last that inprinciple the  operation of the overseas wireless telephone  service should be in thehands of the body which is entrusted with the conduct of the overseas telegraphs.The Report of the 1928 Conference (para. 14 above) had led the Company to expect that at least the Company&apos;s Beam stations would have been utilized for the Imperial Wireless telephone services.    The Company&apos;s case in this regard and upon telephonygenerally was placed before a Committee of the British Cabinet in 1929-30, whichdecided not to use the Company&apos;s stations  for this purpose.   C. &amp; W. Ltd. stilladheres to its original view, and desires to establish closer relations with the G.P.O.in regard to the telephone services from the  United Kingdom, the ultimate object being that  the conduct of these wireless telephone services should be handed overto the Company.    111. During  the financial year 1934-35 the total cost of the G.P.O.  wirelesstelephone services was about  174,000 and the revenue about   127,000.  these services, which may be  regarded  as  forming  a natural extension  of the inlandtelephone system operated by the G.P.O. in the United Kingdom,  are still  at anearly stage of development, the mainstay of the system being  the transatlanticservice.  There is a large  margin of  capacity on most radiotelephony channels,and the Post Office has followed a  policy of improving and  cheapening  these communications,  which takes full account of commercial considerations.
    112. The Company claims that the overseas telephones are frequently com-petitive with the overseas telegraphs and that the policy of the British Post Office in reducing rates has  damaged the Company&apos;s revenues.   The British Post Officechallenges this contention ;  and it does not appear to be established that on the long distance Empire routes, the telephone is a serious competitor with  the  overseastelegraphs at the present time.  The telegraph service offers the addition of a writtenrecord, and  admits of the use of  highly condensed codes.  The service is operatedtwenty-four hours a day, whereas the main telephone services operate,on an averageonly about six hours a day.  The minimum charge for an ordinary telegram to SouthAfrica, for example, is 3s. 9d., whereas the minimum charge under the reduced scaleput forward by the Post Office for a telephone call of three minutes is  3.  Takingtogether the telephone services between the United Kingdom and Australia, Indiaand South Africa, the total telephone traffic  during  the nine months from June,1935, to February, 1936, represented a daily average of twenty-four calls, comparedwith telegraph  traffic which probably amounted to between 5,000  and 10,000telegrams a  day.    113. We are in sympathy with some aspects of  the Company&apos;s  case  and  weentirely agree that whenever possible C. &amp; W. Ltd.  and its associated and subsidiary companies should participate in  the  development of overseas  telephone  services.C. &amp; W. Ltd. has introduced wireless telephone services from Kenya to Londonand from Bermuda  and Kingston (Jamaica)  to  the U.S.A. and has control of theinternal telephone systems in Cyprus, Peru, and Ecuador. The overseas companies in Canada, Australia,  South Africa and India all operate overseas telephones side by side with  overseas telegraphy.  It is clear that particularly on the shorter services,the wireless telephone may react  on the telegraphs.  Wireless  telegraphy andtelephony are likely to  be  closely associated in technical  development,  and theestablishment of a direct wireless telephone route between two countries naturallyleads to pressure for a direct wireless telegraph circuit.    114. We consider that this  matter should  be kept  in mind, and that if any useful method of co-ordinating the two services should arise in future, it should beconsidered.  At the present  stage  of development, however, it does not appear to us that the time is ripe when steps can be taken to  co-ordinate, either in finance or inoperation, the wireless telephone  services  from the United Kingdom with the tele-graph services of C. &amp; W. Ltd. ;  nor do we consider  it practicable to suggest thatthese services from the United Kingdom should be handed over to C. &amp; W. Ltd.We accordingly make no recommendation, and we have informed the Companyaccordingly.           G.P.O. RADIOTELEGRAPH SERVICES WITH SHIPS AT  SEA.    115. At a late stage in our negotiations, C. &amp; W. Ltd. made a turther claim,that the radiotelegraph service operated by the G.P.O. in the United kingdom with ships at sea should be transferred to the  Company.    116. The G.P.O. operates a number of small coastal wireless  stations in GreatBritain  and Ireland giving a service with a range of 250 to 300 miles on ships&apos;wavelengths, and also operates large stations at Rugby and Portishead.    117.  Rugby and Portishead give long distance ship service on a long wave witha range of about 2,000 miles, or on short wave to practically any part of the world. (C 24174)                                                               D2
    118. The tariff is at various rates shown in the Post Office Guide, and ratesfor the long distance service were recently reduced.  To some slight extent these services can be said to be in competition with C. &amp; W. Ltd. services :-           (a) In addition to the Post Office service direct to ships there is still a      small amount of traffic on the older system  by which messages to ships in      any part of the world are sent by cable to local coastal stations and thence      to ships  in the neighbourhood.           (6) There is some risk of ordinary telegraph traffic being handed over      to  ships for transmission when the  cable rate, e.g.,  in the  West African      &quot;Colonies, is higher than the ship service rate.   The Post Office have taken      steps to stop this illicit traffic.     119.  It does not appear to us that the competitive element is serious in this case,though  the matter might be reviewed by the G.P.O. from time to time.    In thecircumstances,  however, we make no recommendation.     RECOMMENDATION (5)-THE  BOARD AND  THE ADVISORY                                COMMITTEE     120.  Instead of the present arrangements with regard to the Board of C. &amp; W. Ltd.and the Imperial Communications Advisory  Committee, there  should be added to theexisting Board  of Directors of C. &amp; W. Ltd. a further seven Directors, each of whom would be nominated by the Company, and approved by one of the Imperial Governmentsnow represented on the Advisory Committee ; one by the United Kingdom Government,one by Canada, one by Australia, one by New Zealand, one by South Africa, one bythe Irish  Free  State, and one by India.  The present arrangements for the approvalof the Chairman  of C. &amp;  W.  Ltd. by  the United Kingdom  Government to remain. The Advisory Committee to be dissolved and arrangements to be made to the satisfaction of the Governments with regard to such existing powers of the Committee as cannotsuitably  be transferred to the reconstituted Board.   The provision in the  existing agreement that  the Boards of all the Companies in the group must be identical to bewaived.   All the Directors of C. &amp; W. Ltd. to be British subjects.     121.  The arrangements recommended by the 1928 Conference with regard tothe Boards of the Companies and the establishment of the Imperial CommunicationsAdvisory Committee, have been described in a previous section (paras. 10 and 12).The difficulties which&apos; have arisen in the working of these arrangements both before and since the examination of this matter by the Greene Committee have been set out sufficiently in our previous Reports to the Governments.   We felt it was essential to the successful conduct of the Company  under  the scheme now recommended that the position of the Board of Directors in relation to the Advisory Committee should be re-examined in collaboration with the Company.     122.  Under  the present Articles  of Association the Directors of the Holding Company (C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd.) become ipso facto directors of  C. &amp; W.  Ltd.  The directors  of C  &amp; W.  (H.) Ltd. must not exceed 22 in  number, but unless otherwise determined by the Company in general meeting, are not to be less than 12 in number.   The directors are subject to election in rotation by the shareholders of C.  &amp;  W. (H.)  Ltd., and two of  them, one of whom  is  to be Chairman of C. &amp; W. Ltd., are to be at all times persons whose appointments have been approved by His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom,  being persons nominated by the Court  of Directors  for  such appointment.   All the  directors (with one exception made at the outset  in favour of the Marquese  Marconi) must be British subjects.
    123. At present  there are 12  directors in all, of  whom Mr. Wilshaw is theGovernment-approved Chairman of C. &amp; W. Ltd.   The appointment of the secondGovernment-approved director is in abeyance.    124. The  composition  and  powers of Imperial  Communications AdvisoryCommittee are laid down in the Treasury Agreement of 29th May, 1929.  TheCommittee consists of eight representatives, one appointed by each of the  PartnerGovernments,  and one appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  Theauthoritative powers of the Advisory Committee, which are exercised solely inrelation to C. &amp; W. Ltd., are briefly            (a)  Veto  on increase  of rates, withdrawal of  reduced rate  services      and discontinuance of any route or service.           (b)  Veto on sale, lease, etc., of property rights or assets used for com-      munications within the British Empire (except  in the ordinary course of      administration and management), and on agreements bringing any part of      the Imperial system under foreign control.          -(c)  Veto  on exercise of borrowing  powers by the Company beyond a      certain limit, and on issue of new share capital.           (d)  The Advisory Committee is the medium for conveying strategic      requirements of the Governments  to C. &amp; W. Ltd. and determines whether      loss to C. &amp; W. Ltd. requiring compensation is involved.           (e) The Advisory Committee is empowered to  apply a share of any      surplus  over the Standard Revenue  to improvement of the services or      reduction of rates, and also to scrutinise the Company&apos;s accounts to ensure      that the Standard Revenue provisions have been duly carried out.    125. The  cost of the Advisory  Committee, including the remuneration ofmembers and administration expenses, amounts to about  7,500 p.a. and is met bythe Company.   While the 1928 Conference did not attempt to lay down the precisecomposition of the Committee or to dehne the status of its members, the Committeewas intended to give the Governments an effective measure of control over policy.The members were not intended to be only delegates of Governments,  but wereto be required, for example, to weigh the relative merits of strategical requirements and the interests of the public in  regard to cheap communications where these twomight conflict, and to advise the  Governments accordingly.    126. The Greene Committee examined the difficulties which had arisen betweenthe Board of Directors and the Committee and stated that the powers of the AdvisoryCommittee had not caused any impediment  in the  Company&apos;s business &quot; exceptin so far as the Committee is not now authorised to deal fully with the questionswhich are brought before it.&quot;  It recommended an extension of the Committee&apos;activities  and influence with the Company and  the  Governments so that theCommittee might act &quot;as a joint council for the whole Empire.&quot;   The members were to be regarded as members of a council rather than delegates, and it wassuggested that arrangements should be made by the Governments in the Dominionsfor all questions of policy in the Dominions regarding alterations in rates, etc., to bereferred to the Advisory Committee for report before action was taken.  In dealingwith questions of rates the Committee was to exercise its powers in such a  way as to  enable  the  Company  to earn a reasonable return. The closest  and mostharmonious relations were  to be developed  between the  Committee and the directors of the Company, both collectively and individually.  (C 24174)                                                               D 3
    127. While we have endeavoured to carry out our duties to the satisfaction ofthe  Governments which we represent, we  feel bound to say that the presentmachinery is ineffective in relation to  the really vital point, namely the framing of the Company&apos;s major policy.  Our authoritative powers are rarely exercised, andwhen  exercised  often  affect  only  minor points on which  no real  issue  arises,e.g., the increase of tariffs, as the automatic result of some increase of outpaymentswhich the Company  is required  to meet.  On major issues,  the  Company isrequired  to consult us before adopting any scheme for extending or  restrictingits operations, &quot;in so far as such scheme involves questions of general policy andnot  only  questions of ordinary business and management.&quot;  In practice  thisdistinction is  unreal  in dealing with  the  affairs  of  a commercial undertaking.Policy and business  and  management  are inextricably  interwoven.   We are necessarily out of touch with the  ordinary run of the Company&apos;s affairs, and italmost inevitably results that important questions  of policy do  not come  beforeus until a final stage when the issues are practically determined.   128. We now suggest that instead of the present arrangements set out  in theTreasury Agreement with regard to the Board of C. &amp; W. Ltd. and the AdvisoryCommittee, there should be added to  the  existing Board of C.  &amp; W.  Ltd. (nowtwelve in number), a  further seven Directors each of whom would be nominated by the Company and approved by  the respective Governments represented on theAdvisory  Committee.   One such director (in addition to the Chairman of C. &amp; W.Ltd.) would be  approved by the  Government of the United Kingdom, one by canada, one by Australia, one by  New Zealand, one by South Africa, one by theIrish Free  State and one by  India.  These  approved Directors would replace theexisting Advisory Committee.   129. We consider   that the  present arrangements for the  approval of theChairman of C.  &amp; W. Ltd. should remain ;  and that he should  also be theChairman of all the operating communications companies, of which substantially100 per cent, of the capital is held  by C. &amp; W. Ltd.  We also consider that thereshould be no exception to the rule that all the Directors of C. &amp; W. Ltd. should be british subjects.   130. The Government approved Directors should have the same remuneration,and  the  same duties  and obligations towards  the  shareholders  as the ordinaryDirectors, and should be approved by the Governments for a term to be decided.They should be men with wide business or financial experience who would be con-cerned particularly with the interests of the country by whose Government theywere approved, and would be available to maintain liaison with these Governments.   131. It will be  seen that the  above arrangements are an extension of theprinciple of appointing Government approved Directors on  the nomination of theCompany, which was adopted in  the original scheme of 1928.  Instead of directorsbeing approved only by the Government of the United Kingdom, the Imperialresponsibilities of the Company are  recognized by the same right being given to theother Governments concerned.  We prefer that these directors should be approvedrather than nominated by the Governments.   It is important  to ensure  theharmonious working  of the  Board,  and  at  the same time to safeguard theGovernments from direct responsibility for  the  direction and management of theCompany which the appointment  of Government  nominees might imply.   132. The amalgamation of interests which we propose  does  not involve any increase in cost or numbers over the present scheme consisting of a separate Boardand a separate Advisory Committee.  The Board of Directors would be strengthened,and  the  Imperial fink which is  vital to the organisation would be  maintained.
 Since the whole conduct of the Company&apos;s affairs depends on co-operation by and with the Governments we see no reason why the Government approved Directors, who will remain legally responsible to the shareholders should be involved in conflicting loyalties.  If surplus earnings  are  available over the Basic  Dividend figure, both the Governments (who represent the public user) and the shareholder will benefit.  The control of the revenue and the expenditure of C. &amp; W. Ltd. is thus a common interest.  A scheme which will ensure that the. Company&apos;s policy is directed by a Board largely approved by the Imperial Governments, and closely in touch with those Governments, is rendered necessary by the  arrangements we propose with regard to the Beam Rental, the Basic Dividend and the strategic cables.   Outside control is  of  little use.  The Governments interests  on these matters can  best be safeguarded by approved Directors immediately responsible for the Company&apos;s affairs ;  and these Directors acting together or individually will be  available  to advise  and assist the Governments with full knowledge of the working of the Company.     133. The Government approved Directors of C. &amp; W. Ltd. should not necessarily sit also on the Board of C.  &amp; W.  (H) Ltd.  The interests of  communications are separate  from the investment  and manufacturing interests of the group, and we can see no reason, at this stage, to require  these different interests to be combined under the  terms of the Treasury Agreement.  It would facilitate the  eventual reorganisation of the group if the provision that the Boards of all the Companies should be identical could be waived.    134.  The present authoritative powers of the Advisory Committee as set out in the Treasury Agreement must be redistributed  under the new scheme  to  the satisfaction of the Governments.   We have already suggested the arrangements which might be made for the application of surplus funds under the Basic Dividend scheme to rate reductions and development (para. 81).   With regard to  the other powers : -           (i) In the Empire generally control of rates is maintained in the hands      of the Governments concerned by the  licences under which the system is      operated.  In the United Kingdom the existing licence to C. &amp; W.  Ltd.      would require amendment, and we suggest  that His Majesty&apos;s Government      should take into  its own hands the power  of veto on  rate increases from      the  United Kingdom and on the withdrawal of cheap rate services.  The      reconstituted Board should be free,  however, to discontinue existing routes      subject to reasonable notice to the Government.           (ii) It is essential to the continuance of the Imperial  Communications      scheme that  C. &amp; W. Ltd.  should  not  dispose  of any assets required for      Imperial traffic either to a British competitor or to a foreign concern. This      veto must remain but should be vested in the Governments of the territories      affected.           (iii)  Control  of borrowing powers might be  left to the Board,  but in      view of the Basic Dividend  scheme, no new share capital  of C. &amp; W. Ltd.      in excess  of  30,000,000 should be issued save with consent of the United      Kingdom Government.           (iv)  Strategic directions would be given direct to the Company  by the      Governments  concerned, who  would also decide the compensation to be      given to the  Company.    135.  A further point for consideration is the  date  when  those arrangements should come into force.  We contemplate that if our recommendations are accepted,some time must elapse before they can become fully effective.   We recommendthat this new scheme should come into effect on or after 1st  January, 1938, andthat until this time.the Advisory Committee should remain in being and  should thus be available to assist in framing the detailed arrangements required,  (C 24174)                                                               D 4
            RECOMMENDATION (6)-THE  RATE SCHEDULE    136. A  comprehensive examination of the Company&apos;s  rate schedule to be carriedout by a Committee  of five, under the Chairmanship of the Government-approvedChairman of the Company with two representatives appointed by the Company, andtwo representatives appointed by the Advisory Committee.    137. The  Imperial Governments to send the Permanent Heads of their respectivePostal Administrations, to attend in London at the time of the Imperial  Conferencein 1937, to  confer with the  above  Committee with the intention of formulating an acceptable rates scheme.    138. The above Committee not to be appointed until the general scheme recommended in this Report is  accepted in principle by the Imperial Governments concerned ; but none of the recommendations under (1)  to (5) above to become effective until a reasonably satisfactory settlement on the question of  the rate  schedule has been accepted by, theparties concerned.    139. The  case submitted by the Company in May last on the matter of ratereductions and the rate schedule was that the telegraph  rates adopted  by foreign government  to  foster trade, and the rates which were adopted by the BritishGovernment for the Beam services  were uneconomic in their application to theCompany&apos;s system as  a whole.  It was admitted that the existing rate structurehad grown up haphazard, and it was promised to lay before the Advisory  Com-mittee in due course proposals for a review of the whole rate structure.  Meantime,until  a satisfactory scheme regarding rates was agreed, the Company asked  to be compensated for any loss involved.by rate reductions required by the Governments.    140. The  question of rates is fundamental to any satisfactory settlement  ofthe difficulties between the Company and the Imperial Governments.  When theCompany&apos;s rates appear high, the Governments  naturally consider the possibilityof a cheaper service  by direct wireless, and foreign undertakings  may be  ready tofacilitate such a  service for their own reasons.   The greatest immediate pressure for direct wireless services with the Empire comes from Japan, whose communica-tions  undertakings are an instrument  of national policy which may override ordinaryeconomic considerations.   Though C. &amp; W. Ltd. has made  considerable  reductions in rates since  the merger, very little has been done in recent years  in respect  ofImperial rates, and  most  reductions have been the result of wireless competitionon the Company&apos;s foreign circuits.   A number of urgent claims for rate reductionby Imperial Governments are now long outstanding,  among others a claim byNew  Zealand  for a  reduction of rates with Great  Britain, by the  British west african Colonies for  a reduction of  rates  with  Great Britain, and by Australia,New  Zealand, South Africa and East Africa for  a reduction of rates with Japan.The Company has admitted, and we need not labour the point,  that the present rate structure is  full of. anomalies.  Among other  things, the cable and wirelessrates  between the U.K. and Australia are still not assimilated.   There is clearlymuch room for rationalisation and simplification  of the tariffs.    141. It may be  useful, however, to consider what can be  argued from theCompany&apos;s  side :             (i) The War doubled the price of most commodities.  In the United       Kingdom  inland telegraph rates and postage rates were raised, but overseas       telegraph rates remained unchanged. -           (ii) Since the War, the process of cheapening overseas telegraphy has       been continuous by reduction in ordinary rates and by the introduction of       cheaper categories of traffic.  Taking as a basis certain representative channels.
      namely, the services between the United Kingdom and South Africa, India,      Australasia and South America, C. &amp; W. Ltd. states that in 1935 it carried      109 per cent, more words than in 1920,  and that the value of this traffic to      the Company decreased by 46 per cent.   Comparing results for these services      in 1928 and 1935, the traffic between these dates fell 8 percent, in volume      and 25 per cent, in value.          (iii) When Great Britain abandoned  the Gold Standard in  1931,  the      Government decided not to notify a new gold equivalent which would have      raised  telegraph collections in the United  Kingdom,  and this decision was      followed in most other countries in the Empire.          (iv) Consideration  must also be  given to  the  effect  on  telegraph      revenues of the decisions taken by the International Telecommunications      Conferences with regard to the proportionate  cost of the different categories      of telegraphic traffic. The Company points out that though representatives of      telegraph  companies  co-operate  at  these Conferences  in  a consultative      capacity, they are not entitled to vote.   The final decision on the regulations      governing telegraph practice and telegraph receipts rests entirely with the      Administrations, and the effect is borne very largely by the private companies,      such as Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd.          (v) The general result  is that the  rate level is insufficient to give an      economic return on the capital invested in the undertaking, which on the      1928 Standard is taken at over 6 per cent,  on  30,000,000.    142. In our view it is of major importance that the present opportunity should.be taken to settle the Imperial rate structure on a fair and logical basis which willgive a prospect of a reasonable return to the  shareholder and safeguard the best interests of the public user.   On  the  one  hand, the proposed reduction in  theStandard Revenue to a 4 per cent. Dividend Basis sets a new standard for  the expectations of the shareholder. On the other, the arrangement proposed for the&apos;cancellation of the Beam Rental gives a substantial relief to the Company, whichshould fairly be taken into account in considering the future tariff, since it may wellbe that  reductions in rates, which may ultimately benefit both the  Company andthe general public, may result temporarily in loss of revenue to the Company.We consider that  the procedure we recommend is calculated, with goodwill on all sides, to produce  a lasting settlement.  Decisions must be  taken by  the new committee in direct touch  with the Permanent Heads  of the Imperial  PostalAdministrations,  and an  opportunity  is afforded  of settling  other  outstandingdifficulties besides the immediate question  of  the rate schedule.  While  the final decisions must necessarily be in some respects a compromise between conflicting-views, we  think a fair adjustment of views  should be attainable.  If a reasonably satisfactory settlement cannot be reached between  C. &amp; W.  Ltd. and the ImperialGovernments, it is useless to proceed with the general scheme we have recommended.       SUPPLEMENTARY  OBSERVATIONS  OF THE  COMMITTEE    143. The foregoing  recommendations  complete the  scheme which we putforward in agreement with the Directors of C. &amp; W. Ltd.   To supplement thisscheme we now wish to state our attitude on certain other matters which have come before us, which do not involve specific recommendations.                         DIRECT WIRELESS SERVICES    144. In the forefront of the case submitted in May last C. &amp; W. Ltd. asked forthe formation of a common policy by the Governments of the  Empire to prevent theopening of new direct wireless services between foreign territories and points in the
 British Empire, in order to protect the existing cable network which the Company might otherwise be unable to maintain.   If the Governments desired direct wireless services to be opened, the Company claimed that it should be compensated by the Government concerned.     145. We have dealt with this question in  an earlier section of this Report (paras. 31-39).  We desire to add now that we cannot agree with the principle suggested by the Company that it should be compensated in the event of new wireless circuits being  opened.  This  suggestion implies  that  the Company has a complete legal monopoly of Imperial telegraphic communications, which appears to us to be neither desirable nor practicable.  We have already said (para.  140) that the pressure for direct  wireless services in  the Empire comes mainly from difficulties over the question of rates.  We hope that the revision of the rate schedule we have recom- mended will  remove these difficulties.     146. It should also be clearly understood that in the last resort the Governments must be free to authorise and establish new circuits  which are required for traffic purposes if for any reason C. &amp;  W. Ltd. is unwilling to open such circuits.     147. A further step to solve this problem would be to establish more intimate connection between C.  &amp; W. Ltd. and the local communication companies through- out the  Empire by the extension of j oint working of cable and wireless, coupled with suitable joint purse schemes, or some other fair basis of revenue apportionment. We hope that with the co-operation of the Governments steps to this end will be taken by the Companies concerned.     148. But the ultimate safeguard  of C. &amp; W.  Ltd. in the matter of direct wireless  competition must be the maintenance by the Imperial Governments of the present accepted policy to co-operate and to  consult between themselves in the common interest, in order to  maintain the maximum volume of  telegraph traffic over the Imperial system by discouraging any diversion of  traffic to foreign routes, and by avoiding the establishment  of services  which might work in opposition to the present Imperial undertaking.                       PACIFIC CABLE BOARD ANNUITY    149. We have considered the request made by C. &amp; W. Ltd.  that  we should approach the authorities  concerned to obtain the cessation  of payment by the Company of the Pacific Cable Board annuity.    150. When the Pacific Cable Board was established in 1901,  the original capital of  2,000,000 was in effect advanced wholly  by the British Government. The National Debt Commissioners advanced this  amount as a  loan repayable by a 50 year annuity ending in  1949.  This annuity was an equal annual sum of  77,545 covering principal and interest  at 3 per cent.    151. By  the Pacific Cable Act of ,1901 and subsequent  Acts, the responsibility for meeting this annuity and the annual expenses of the Board so far as not coveredby receipts was divided between the Partner Governments as follows :          United Kingdom      ..     . .     ..    . .     . .   5/18ths.         Canada  . .     ......     .  .    . .     . .   5/18ths.         Australia        . .     . .........6/18ths.         New Zealand    ..     ..     ......&apos;   ..   2/18ths.
    152.  The total cost of constructing the original Pacific Cable, and the variousduplications financed out of profits amounted to nearly    . .  4,700,000        Under the Merger scheme C. &amp; W. Ltd. paid for these          assets in cash the sum of  . .     . .     ..     . .    516,486        And also  took over the obligation  for the debt to          the National Debt Commissioners  outstanding at          31st March, 1928, of       ..     ... .&apos;   ..     ...  1,233,544              Making a total of     ......... 1,750,030    153. Under the Treasury agreement, the annual payment of the Pacific CableBoard annuity by C. &amp; W. Ltd. is guaranteed by C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd.  The annuityof  77,545 has been duly paid by C. &amp; W. Ltd. up to 1st December, 1936, leaving13 annual payments still to be made.  The interest portion of the annuity, which alone is charged to the Revenue Account  of C. &amp; W. Ltd., amounted in  1935 to 27,562.    154. As a result of the principal repayments made by the Company since 1928,the capital amount of the Pacific Cable debt  outstanding at 31st December, 1935,was  875,236.    155. Legislation was taken by the Dominions concerned and by the imperial parliament to ratify the sale of the Pacific Cable assets to C.  &amp; W.  Ltd.  this legislation terminated the  arrangement between the Partner Governments forsharing  responsibility for the annuity and other liabilities of the Board, but interms of the Imperial Telegraphs Act of 1929 the Consolidated Fund of the UnitedKingdom  remains chargeable with the Pacific Cable annuity, if  for any reasonC. &amp; W. Ltd. fails to pay.    156. Our views on this matter are as follows :           (i) The benefit of the Company&apos;s proposal to its Revenue  Account  is      comparatively trivial.          (ii) The ground on which the claim is put forward is presumably that      the Company was overcharged when the original bargain was made.   While      it is true that the revenues of the Pacific Cable Board were dwindling when      the assets were taken over, C. &amp; W. Ltd. acquired a practically new cable and      a second cable 27 years old at less than half their original cost.          (iii) The sale of the Pacific Cable assets to C. &amp; W. Ltd. cannot be distin-      distinguished from the sale  of other Government cable  assets to the Company      except that &quot; easy payment &quot; terms were  allowed in this  case by giving      C. &amp;  W. Ltd. the benefit of the 3 per cent.  Pacific Cable  annuity.   The      British Government could not be expected to meet the whole liability of the      Pacific Cable Annuity, since it was only a partner to the extent of  5/18ths      with  the Dominion Governments in the original liability.  C.  &amp; W. Ltd.      could only be released from its obligations if all the Partner Governments      were  willing to reassume pro rota their original liability.    157. In these circumstances, we are  unable  to  recommend that  this matter should be reopened, and we have informed the Company accordingly.
          CAPITALISATION OF C. &amp; W.  LTD. AND C. &amp; W. (H.) LTD.    158. The initial capitalisation of the Merger Company was   53,000,000, butthe settlement  or approval of this  figure by the 1928 Conference did not arise,although it must have been apparent that it was too high.    159. The Conference required the formation of a separate  CommunicationsCompany.  The capital of C. &amp; W. Ltd., which was fixed at  30,000,000, was not open to serious criticism at the time having regard to the value of the assetstransferred and their anticipated earning capacity, but it has proved to be excessiveby reference to  actual earning power, and some reduction is desirable.    160. The reorganisation of C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd. is a matter for the Directors andshareholders of that Company.   It is now  generally admitted that the capital ofC. &amp; W. (H.)  Ltd.  must at some  time  be written down.   In 1935 a voluntaryscheme for the repayment  of Preference Share Capital of C. &amp; W.  (H.) Ltd. was put into effect, which left the issued Preference Capital at   16,766,227, and thetotal issued capital  at  46,236,145.  This scheme was useful in a limited way, butthe real problem of reconstruction remains to be dealt with.  C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd.has nearly  21,000,000  of  &quot;A&quot; stock and nearly  9,000,000 of &quot; B &quot; stock onwhich  no  dividend  has ever been paid,  and the process of reconstruction will be one of great difficulty.   161. It is undesirable for the Governments to insist on the direct reduction of thecapital of C. &amp; W. Ltd.  This step would almost certainly involve the reconstruction of C. &amp; W. (H.) Ltd. which would thus be attributed by the public shareholders toGovernment intervention.  Moreover, the capital of C. &amp; W. Ltd. is all in ordinary shares and the  nominal value of these shares is of little real  significance.   almost exactly the same results as a reduction of capital can be achieved by the revisionof the Standard Revenue  arrangement,  which we have  recommended  above(para.  73).  Our proposals with regard to the Beam Rental (para. 65 (b)) will alsoreduce the shareholding in C. &amp; W. Ltd. which is held by the Merger group from 30 millions to   27  millions.   In effect the result in practice of these two proposal is a writing down of the original investment in  C. &amp; W. Ltd. by almost one-half.   162. These steps should make it plain, however,  to the public shareholders of &apos;C. &amp; W. (H) Ltd. that  hopes  of  future dividends from C. &amp; W. Ltd.  must be severely limited.  When this is  clear reconstruction should eventually follow.  Weare hopeful that this reconstruction will be framed on lines which might enableC. &amp; W. Ltd. to become an independent undertaking with its shares held directly by the public outside the present group and subject only to necessary safeguards withregard to  British  control, and to any necessary  arrangements with Marconi&apos;sWireless Telegraph  Company with regard to research and use of  patents.   163. We think that in the revision of the Treasury Agreement which will benecessary if our general scheme is approved, it should be made possible, with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,  for C. &amp; W. Ltd.to be constituted as a separate organisation  on these lines.   164. As a first step to a separate identity we should like also to see C. &amp; W. Ltd.with a name quite distinct from that of the holding Company.  We think the nameof C.  &amp; W. (H.) Ltd. should be changed, and that at the same time consideration should be given to adopting a common basis of nomenclature as far as possible force. &amp;  W.  Ltd.  and  all the overseas communication companies  with which it is associated throughout the Empire.
                         GOVERNMENT  CO-OPERATION     165. In this Report we have suggested a number of ways in which the ImperialGovernments might continue and strengthen their co-operation with C. &amp; W. Ltd.We have recommended that the Governments should direct the maximum amountof traffic to the Company&apos;s system,  that  steps should be taken with regard tocompetitive services conducted by Governments and that as far as possible, thepayments  to  Governments which have  come  within our  purview  should  be restricted to the fair cost of services rendered.     166. We have always held that the  special position of C. &amp; W. Ltd. entitlesthe Company to a measure of preferential treatment which has rightly been withheld from purely private telegraphic undertakings in the past. To-day, when the system is threatened by undertakings subsidised  or controlled by foreign Governments,preferential treatment of C. &amp; W. Ltd. by the Imperial Governments is more than ever necessary.     167. For this reason among others we have favoured  the acquisition of asubstantial block of share capital in  C. &amp; W. Ltd. by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.  We feel that this step will make it clear once and for allthat C.  &amp; W. Ltd. is entitled to receive in all its activities preferential treatmentby the Government.  We mention in  particular the importance  of full diplomaticsupport being accorded to the  Company by the British  Government in all  its activities  in  foreign countries which the  British Government is  interested  tomaintain.   We  should  like to see steps taken to bring the special position of theCompany to the notice of all the Government Departments concerned.     168. We also suggest that in relation to advertising, the  G.P.O.  in the UnitedKingdom should give a special preference to the facilities offered by  C. &amp; W. Ltd.Notices should be placed in prominent places in Post  Offices  drawing attention tothe services operated by the Company, and so far as practicable the G.P.O. shouldafford  the Overseas Telegraph system of C. &amp; W.  Ltd.  the same facilities foradvertising in Government  publications, etc., as the services  directly operated bythe General Post Office.  We  should like to see similar steps taken, wherever possible having regard to local conditions, in  all other countries in the Empire.
CONCLUSION     169. We can now summarise what we have set out to do in this Report.     170. In May last, C. &amp; W. Ltd. asked for a review of all the arrangements set up by the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928, and made six specific proposals, based on the inability of theCompany to earn the Standard Revenue contemplated in 1928, and on the need to protect the Companyagainst foreign competition within the Empire.     171. As empowered by the Governments we have examined jointly with the Company the above proposals and other points, which have arisen in the course of our Inquiry, and we have reviewed theReport of the 1928 Conference and the Report of the Greene Committee of Inquiry in 1931.     172. It is apparent that C. &amp; W. Ltd. conducts a vital public service, which must be maintained inany event not only for the purpose of Imperial Communications in times of peace, but also to safeguard the Empire  in case of  war or emergency.  In general, the communications services operated by theCompany appear to be adequate  and  efficient, though improved  co-ordination  with the  overseascompanies is desirable.  But the main  difficulty is with regard to telegraphic rates, and it is admitted that a revision of the rate schedule is overdue.     173. C. &amp; W. Ltd. has now to face intense competition from wireless telegraph services conducted inmany cases by foreign Governments or by undertakings subsidised or controlled by foreign Governments.The position of the Company&apos;s cable concessions  in foreign territories becomes more and more insecure.Within the Empire the Company must expect increased competition from overseas radiotelephonyand subsidised air services.   The Company&apos;s earning power has been inadequate in the past;  and though there has been a certain improvement as a result of economies made in recent years, there are variouscauses which  may tend to diminish revenues in the  future, unless a  recovery in international tradesubstantially increases the Company&apos;s traffic.     174. In  these circumstances the possibility of direct competition with the Company on its Imperialservices by the introduction of new direct wireless telegraph services, or by a diversion of the Company&apos;sImperial traffic to  foreign routes, presents a serious danger.  These new routes or diversions of trafficare mainly instigated by foreign undertakings.  They may  be required by Imperial Governments fortraffic reasons in exceptional cases ;  but in general such new routes or diversions of traffic from theImperial system must be damaging  to Imperial  interests.  The reason  why these developmentsoccasionally find support within the Empire appears to be, generally, a desire to secure reductions ofrates, which C. &amp;  W. Ltd. under existing conditions is unwilling to give.  A solution of the presentproblem appears to depend, therefore, on the question of rates.     175. As a result of our examination, it appears to us that the 1928 Conference Scheme has been successful in its main objects, but the collapse of international trade in 1930 and the pressure of foreigncompetition on C. &amp; W. Ltd. have caused great difficulties.     176. We have  considered the possibility of adopting some new form of organisation, but we havereached the conclusion that the basis of the 1928 scheme should be retained, namely, the free associationof the Imperial Governments in support of a system of overseas telegraph services owned and operated by private enterprise.    177. In view, however, of the situation with which C. &amp; W. Ltd. is now confronted, we consider that,in the long run, the undertaking can only survive without recourse to Government subsidies or other methods of direct Government assistance if the present organisation is strengthened ;  if C. &amp; W.  Ltd.is relieved as far as possible from payments to Governments over and above the cost of services to theCompany rendered  by the  Governments ; and if the Company is left free to operate as far as possible on strictly commercial lines with a right to compensation in respect of activities required by the Govern-ments for purely strategic  purposes.    178. In the light of these conclusions we have recommended to the Governments a scheme, which weunderstand is  acceptable to the  Directors of C.  &amp; W. Ltd. (1) The Beam Rental    We recommend His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom to cancel the Beam Rentalnow payable by C.  &amp; W. Ltd., and to grant to C. &amp; W. Ltd. the freehold of the Beam Stations in theUnited Kingdom, an extension of its licence, and two other minor concessions in consideration of thetransfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of  3,000,000  1 Shares to be  found fromthe existing capital  of the Company (para. 65.)
(2) The Standard Revenue of C. &amp; W. Ltd.    We recommend the Imperial Governments to agree that instead of the present Standard Revenuearrangements, C. &amp; W. Ltd. should be entitled, out of the balance of earnings of the Company availablefor dividend in each year, to pay a basic dividend not exceeding 4 per cent, on its total capital of  30,000,000(including  3,000,000  share capital to be  allocated to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the UnitedKingdom) ;  any surplus earnings of the Company to be allocated as  to one-half to general purposes(including additional dividends) and as to one-half for the reduction  of rates or the improvement ofImperial Services (para. 73).(3) Strategic Cables    We recommend the Imperial Governments  to  agree in principle that C.  &amp; W. Ltd.  should begiven compensation by the Governments concerned for any expense or loss of revenue incurred in respectof cables not required for commercial purposes which the Company is  prepared to abandon, but whichthe Governments decide must be retained for strategic purposes.  The basis of  compensation and thearrangements to be made for &quot; care and maintenance &quot; of the strategic cables to be settled by theGovernments  after an enquiry which we  suggest should be initiated  forthwith by the Committee ofImperial Defence (para. 82).(4) Overseas Communications Services (Telegraph and Telephone) operated by the General Post Office        in the United Kingdom    We consider that  in general principle these  services conducted by the General Post Office in theUnited Kingdom should be brought into close relation with the services operated by C. &amp; W. Ltd.    With regard to the specific services :     (i) We recommend His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United  Kingdom to agree that negotiations should be opened at once between the General Post Office in the United Kingdom and C. &amp; W.  Ltd.to formulate a scheme for  the transfer to C. &amp; W.  Ltd. of the Anglo-Continental Telegraph Servicesconducted by the General Post Office in the United Kingdom, on a financial basis mutually acceptable,or failing this to co-ordinate the services on  joint purse lines.    (ii) We make no recommendation with regard to overseas  telephony from the United Kingdom orto the General Post Office radiotelegraphy service from the United Kingdom with ships at sea (para. 98).(5) The Board and the Advisory Committee    We recommend the Imperial Governments to agree  that instead of the present arrangements  withregard to the Board of C. &amp; W. Ltd. and the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, thereshould be added to the existing Board of C. &amp; W. Ltd. a further seven Directors, each of whom wouldbe nominated by the Company, and approved by one  of the Imperial Governments now represented onthe Advisory Committee ; one by the United  Kingdom Government, one by Canada, one by Australia,one by New Zealand, one by South Africa, one by the Irish Free State, and one by India.  (We do not recommend the actual nomination of the new Directors by the  Governments, which would be contraryto the principle adopted hitherto, and might imply a direct Government responsibility for the ordinarymanagement of  the Company, which is clearly undesirable.)    We recommend that the present arrangements for the approval of the Chairman of C. &amp; W.  Ltd.should remain ;  that all the Directors of C.  &amp; W. Ltd. without exception should be British subjects ;and that the Boards of all the companies in the group should not necessarily be identical as at present.    We further recommend  that  the above arrangements should  be  made effective on or after1st January, 1938, until which date the Advisory Committee should remain in  being.  The  AdvisoryCommittee then to be  dissolved and arrangements to be made to the satisfaction of the  governments with regard to such powers of the Committee as cannot suitably be  transferred to the reconstitutedBoard.  We have suggested in para. 134 how these powers might be allocated (para. 120).(6) The Rate Schedule    We recommend that a comprehensive  examination of the Company&apos;s rate schedule should becarried out by a Committee of five, under the  Chairmanship of the Chairman of the Company, with two representatives appointed by  the Company, and two representatives appointed by the Advisory Committee.We recommend the Imperial  Governments to send the Permanent Heads of their respective PostalAdministrations to attend in London at the time of the Imperial Conference in 1937, to confer with theabove Committee with the intention of formulating an acceptable rates scheme.   The above Committeenot to be appointed until the general scheme recommended in this Report is accepted in principle by theImperial Governments concerned; but none of the recommendations (1) to (5) above to become effectiveuntil a reasonably satisfactory settlement on the question of the rate schedule has been accepted by theparties concerned (paras. 136-138).
     179. We accordingly ask all the Imperial Governments concerned to decide as early as possible,prior to the Imperial Conference, whether they are prepared in general principle to approve the recom-mendations set out under (1) to  (5) above, subject of course to any necessary statutory powers being obtained and subject to a further examination of the detailed arrangements in due course.  In our view it is necessary to settle these matters in general principle before the examination of the Company&apos;s RateSchedule which we recommend under (6) above.   We hope the Governments concerned will agree andwill take the necessary steps for this examination to be made in consultation with the Permanent Headsof their respective Postal Administrations.    180. We recommend that the examination of the rate schedule should take  place  as nearly  aspossible at the time of the next Imperial Conference, in order to facilitate the attendance of the importantofficials concerned,  and to  enable these officials  to  be  in touch  with responsible Ministers of  their governments in the event of immediate decisions being  required.    181. We are hopeful that this examination will enable a fair and reasonable settlement to be made ofall outstanding difficulties with regard to the rates  schedule, which  should be adjusted having regard tothe new Basic Dividend of the Company, and should also take full account of the substantial concession to the Company which we propose in connection with the Beam Rental.    182. It will be seen from the above that the basis of the scheme we now recommend for the approvalof the Imperial Governments is a settlement of the Rates Schedule satisfactory to all concerned.  Weare confident that a satisfactory settlement can be reached, and that the Governments and the Companywill then be able to implement the recommendations set out in  the agreed scheme. We contemplate that the new scheme should be made fully operative on or after 1st  January, 1938.    183. In addition to our specific recommendations we have stated our views on the question of DirectWireless Services, the Pacific Cable Board Annuity, the Capitalisation of the Companies and the important question of Government co-operation.    184. It is our  considered opinion that the scheme we now recommend will enable the Companysuccessfully to face the increasing competition with which it is confronted in  world communications andthus with the full and free support of the Imperial  Governments, to preserve in its integrity an ImperialService that is of vital importance to the commercial well-being and defence of the British Commonwealth.(Signed)  CAMPBELL STUART.
