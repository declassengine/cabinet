This document  is the property of His Britannic MajeBt,y&apos;s  Government.-&quot;     &quot;                                           183                  Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1937SECRET.CP. 36  (37).THE CABINETLOAN  OF MILITARY STORES FOR THE  USE OF             UNEMPLOYED MARCHERS        MEMORANDUM  BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR     1. I wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to a question which has arisen from    57time to time  in connection with marches of unemployed  men  from various parts of    M.I.the country : namely, the  propriety of acceding to  requests  from local authorities   4188for the loan of blankets or other military stores for the use of the men.     2. Last  October requests  were received from the West  Riding County Counciland the Willesden Borough Council for the loan of Army blankets for the marchersfrom Jarrow  and Scotland.  I  was not inclined to  accede to these requests, since  itwas the policy of the Government to. discourage  such marches* and it seemed  to methat the War  Office would be acting improperly in appearing to  be thus countenancingthem.  In both cases, however, I deferred to the  express wishes of the Minister ofHealth,  and  approved the  loans.   (I may  mention here  that  the use  of TerritorialArmy drill halls  by  &quot; marchers &quot;  involves other  considerations and  I have  given instructions that it is not to be  allowed; this,  of  course, in no  way affects the use ofthese buildings  for the physical training of  the unemployed under schemes organizedby Local Authorities.)     3. A request for the loan of blankets for the Scottish marchers was made  at thesame time to the Air Ministry by the Willesden Borough Council.   The Secretaryof State for Air informs me that in October, 1932, his predecessor, after  consulting the Minister of  Health and other Ministers,  including  the Secretary of State for War,decided that  blankets should not be issued for this  purpose :  that this  decision  was confirmed in  1934, and  that the Air Ministry  were  about to act in accordance with iton this  occasion  when  they became aware that the War  Office  were  proposing to accede.   He  accordingly gave instructions that on this occasion the blankets should beprovided if required : but we agreed that it was very  undesirable to have to deal withthese requests at short notice by ad hoc decisions,  and  with Lord Swinton&apos;s concurrenceI wrote to the Minister of  Health and the Minister  of Labour with a view to arriving at a settled policy in the  matter.     4. I  pointed out that it would save much time  and  trouble if all  such requestswere to be refused, and, as stated in paragraph 2 above, such action  seemed to be consistent with  the general view of the Cabinet.  It is true that no charge would fallon Army or Royal Air Force Votes in respect of these loans, since the Local authority concerned would meet  the  cost of transport and of any  consequent cleaning  and losses.  But  if  it became  known  that  requests for blankets,  etc., would always begranted,  the  demands might become more frequent and in that event there would be considerable  wear and tear; for this we should have  to make a charge, but no  directaccount could be made  out for the time expended by the officers and men concernedin the issue and recovery of the articles.                       * Cabinet Meeting 57 (36) :  Conclusion 3.Cor? No.   41
     5.  The Minister of Labour replied that, since marchers, in so far as they were in need, became the responsibility of the Poor Law Authorities, the question was one forthe Minister  of Health rather than himself.   He  was in entire agreement  that thesemarches should be discouraged, but, so  far as he was concerned,  he should not feeldisposed to place difficulties in the way of the proper performance of their duties  bythe Poor Law Authorities.     6.  The  Minister  of  Health  in his  reply points  out  that  a  Public  AssistanceAuthority is legally bound, on application, to provide accommodation for any marcherswho have not the means,  or are otherwise unable, to obtain lodging; and he suggeststhat any assistance which a Government Department may be in a position to  renderto a Local Authority in the execution of its statutory duties should normally be afforded.The application of this view does not, he thinks, conflict with the general policy ofdiscouraging  these marches.  Once such  a march is in progress, it has to be reckonedwith and occasions of friction between  the men  and those who have a public duty to perform in relation to them are, wherever  possible,  to be avoided.   The Ministerof Health,  however,  does not regard  it as possible to  lay down any  hard and fastrule.  In similar circumstances he  would  feel bound to give the same advice as before,but he proposes that our Departments should. consult in  every case where the service authorities feel any  doubt as to  the  propriety of  acceding to  ti  Local Authority&apos;request.     7.  The Secretary of State  for  Air  is in agreement with me  that it  is clearly desirable that the Service  Departments should follow a definite ruling in dealing withthese requests.  We are reluctant to agree that each  decision should depend on theresult of ministerial or inter-departmental discussion of the merits of each  case.  Thesame  question of principle seems  to us  to arise every  time, and  it would facilitate.the conduct of business if the Cabinet would give a ruling.     .  &apos;      &apos;                                  .                 .  -  -   D. C.  THE WAR OFFICE,     29th January, 1937.(B37/8) 70 1/37 VV.O.P. 299
