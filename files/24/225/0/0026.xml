86(51). OOI-Y NO-   q0 A B X N E T.CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS BILL. Memorandum by the Home^Sjecrjtarg.The Cabinet have already decided (Cabinet Conclusions 87(3l) Conclusion l)  that the Children and Young Persons Bill should form a part of the legislative programme of this Session, and it has been announced that the Second Reading of the Bill will be taken on the 4th February, 1932.    It is desirable therefore that the Bill should be in the hands of Members in good time before Parliament reassembles.    The preparation of the Bill is now al-most completed and I propose to submit the text with an explanatory memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee and to the Cabinet in order that approval may be given for the Bill to be printed and made available to Parliament.    In the meantime my colleagues may like to have a brief account of its main provisions.The Bill is based mainly on the recommendations of thewhi chDepartmental Committee on the Treatment of Young Offenders,/after a thorough enquiry;, reached a unanimous conclusion except on one points      The recommendations of this Committee propose a sub-stantial advance on sound practical lines in the method of . treatment of neglected and delinquent young people and consider-ablo pressure has been brought to boar on successive Governments to give them legiclative effects    Opportunity is also being taken to embody in the Bill tho recommendations made in the third Report of the Child Adoption Committee relating to infant life protection and the control of voluntary homes for poor children,  together with such of the recommendations of the Committee on Sexual Offences /
hi O .&apos;Jagainst Young Persons as could properly &quot;be brought within the scope of a Bill of this kind.The Bill is necessarily therefore a long complicated and detailed measure.      It will he welcomed in all quarter and although on certain of its provisions there may he some diso.gr cement among those specially interested in the subject of child welfare, it is unlikely save on one or two points to arouse any political controversy..The following are the main changes which will be proposed by the Bill  :-(1) Juvenile Courts.Juvenile courts were first given statutory recognition by the Children Act of 1908 and were empowered to deal both with young offenders up to the age of 16 and with certain specified classes of neglected children under 14.      Experience has amply proved the importance of these Courts,  and the Bill makes numerous small alterations in the procedure,  constitution and venue of Juvenile Gourts, for the purpose of facilitating their work and extending their opportunities..Under the provisions of the Bill the Juvenile Courts will be empowered to deal with young persons up to the age of 17, instead of 16 as at present, and for all the main purposes of the Children Act a young person will be defined as a person under 17.      In future it will be impossible for a person under 17 to be sent to prison except in special cases of depravity or unruliness. (2)    Neglected young people.Under the Children Act, 1908, the Juvenile Court is empowered to deal with children under 14 on the ground of neglect only if they come within certain limited categories-, such as wandering or being found destitute,  et Experience has shown that many young people who need protection cannot now be dealt.with either because they
have passed the age limit or hecause they do not come within any of the specified categories of neglect.The Bill will remedy the defects of the existing law by substituting for these narrow categories a wide general power of dealing with neglect and by enabling the Juvenile Courts to deal on grounds of neglect, not only with children under 14, but with all young persons up to the age of 17. These proposals, which are based on the recommendations of the Young Offenders Committee, have already met with much support,,(3)    Young Offender?,The most important of the changes which the Bill proposes in relation to young offenders are -(a) The Bill will abolish the existing distinction between Reformatory Schools, which may now be used only for offenders, and Industrial Schools, which are in-tended mainly for neglected children.      In spite of this statutory distinction the character both of the training and the discipline in these Schools is now identical, and the legal distinction serves only as a handicap to their work.      The Bill proposes that in future these Schools shall form a single class to be known as Approved Schools and classified only according to the age,  character and circumstances of the young people they are best fitted to receive.(b) Capital punishment will be abolished under the age of 18 years.      This proposal gives legislative effect to the long established administrative practice.(o) The Bill proposes to alter the law relating to the whipping of children,,      On this question public opinion is sharply divided, and whipping was the only point, on which the Young Offenders Committee were unable to agree.
% *s &apos;^) (d) In accordance with the recommendation of theYoung Offenders Committee,  the age of criminal responsibility will be raised from 7 to 8.The Bill proposes to remove from Courts of Summary Jurisdiction the general power which they now possess to order the whipping of children under 14 convicted summarily of any indictable offence, but to leave unaltered such powers as are now given by individual statutes to publish particular offences by whipping, (4) Employment provisions.It has long been recognised that there is need for some measure of control over the employment of persons between 14 and 18 in those miscellaneous occupations which are not regulated by the Factory Acts, Shop Acts, Mines Acts or any other enactment.      Detailed information regarding the conditions of em-ployment of young people in these occupations is at present being collected by the National Advisory Council for Juvenile Employment, but there is already ample evidence that many of these young people are exposed to excessive hours of work often under unsatis-factory conditions in occupations such as van boy, messenger, cinema and theatre attendant, page and lift boy, and kitchen hand in smaller hotels.      Several Bills to deal with this question have been introduced in Parliament by Private Members including six attempts in the Commons by Lord Henry Cavendish--Bentinck and three in the Lords by Lord Astor;    and although owing to the pressure on parliamentary time none of these Bills made much progress,  the principle which they embodied on all occasions received a large measure of support in Parliament,      So many premises have been given by previous Governments that they would introduce    similarlegislation
2 b dand it has been bo clearly understood in view of statements made by the late    Government that the question would be dealt wifn in the promised Children Bill that I have come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to exclude this subject from the present Bill^      I recognise, on the other hand, that this part of the Bill is likely to provoke opposition on the ground that it may Impose additional burdens on industry, though in my opinion there is not much substance in such a complaintv    Yet tho sympathies of some supporters of the Government may, under present circumstances, be enlisted in support of this attitude, and, as in all probability this is the only point in the Bill which will arouse political controversy., it may be ashed whether it is wise to jeopardise its swift and smooth passage for the sake of including these provisions,   - I am, however, satisfied that the balance of advantage lies on the side of including this provision in  the Bill and allowing the Government ls attitude to bo finally determined in the light of the reception accorded by Parliament to the proposal..Tho Bill as at present&apos;drafted accordingly proposes as regards these unregulated occupations to give to Local Authorities the same powers of regulating by bye-law the employment of persons between 14 and IS as are already exercised by them under the Education Act in respect of children under 14.      Experience has shown that this latter power has on the whole been wisely exercised, and the proposed extension of the bye-law making power to young persons under 18 is a logical development of the existing machinery..It may be added that somewhat similar powers though in a restricted form were included in the Liverpool Corporation General Powers Act 1930 vshieh the House passed without opposition or indeed c0i&quot;aaiento
-   25eThe opportunity has also been taken, with the concurrence of the Board of Education, to re-enact in the Bill with some amendments the provisions at present contained   in the Education Act, 1921, governing the employment of children under school leaving age and of young persons engaged in street trading.      The most important of these amendments is the proposal to bring the lao into harmony with the practice at present obtaining in the greater part of the country by prohibiting street trading under 16, instead of under 14 as at present, and to extend the power of Local Authorities by bye-law to regulate street trading from 16 to 18 years.(6)   Miscellaneous provisions.The Bill includes a number of miscellaneous provisions of a minor character, among which are those recommended by the Child Adoption Committee and approved by the Ministry of Health for amending Part I of the Children Act, 1908, whioh relates to infant life protection.     A clause is also included to give effect to the recommendation of the same Committee for the registration and inspection of all voluntary homes for poor children.A careful estimate has been made of the financial implications of the Bill, and it has been calculated that the improvements to be effected will not involve any appreciable additional expenditure.    On a long view the Bill could be represented as an economy measure, since it may confidently be hoped that by the improved methods provided by the Bill more young people will in future be prevented from entering upon a life of crime and becoming a charge on the State in later years in Borstal Institutions or in Prisons.I trust that toy colleagues *ill agree that the Bill will marl: a definite advance in our present methods of dealing with the problem of neglected end delinquent young people, and will be a substantial measure of social reform.-(Intd.)
