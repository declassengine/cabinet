9 9 nhJ fj XJ&apos;fgZS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT.WNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S E C R S T .&quot; COPY HO.      QC.p.   581 (31).CABINET .FINANCIAL POSITION OP NITTOUNDLAHI).Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State &quot;for &quot;Dominion Affairs,1. v/e think it necessary to draw the attention of our colleagues to the financial position of Newfoundland.2, Partly owing to the world depression, and partly owing to local maladministration and in particular to the lack of proper financial control, their finances are in athe New-      sorry state      For 1930/31    they incurred a deficit of[foundlandfinancial    f/3,900s000;    and for the current year there is a prospective year ends .the 30th      deficit, after allowing for all possible economies,  of a June.further  &apos;37000,000 including the service of the Public Debt. Thanks to the assistance afforded &quot;by Sir Percy Thompson and Mr. Penson of the United Kingdom Civil Service, and by Mr. Magor, a Canadian man of business, whom the Government invited to examine the position this autumn,  it is now hoped that the Budget for 1932/3 may he made to balance at approximately ^9,000,000,  though this involves somewhat optimistic estimates of the yield of additional taxation and the effect of economics in administration.      The ultimate outlook however is net uhhope-ful, given a strong and independent financial control, which appears now to have been set up with the general approval of all Parties.
The urgent problem however is the shortage of immediate cash.      On the 1st January 1932 the sum of  fe, 128,402 is due to be paid on account of interest on the Public Debt, towards which less than ^400.000 is estimated to be available in cash.      The Government is already indebted to its own Bankers, the Bank of Montreal, and other Canadian Banks,  to the extent of S^,500,000, it has failed already to meet some of its bills and it can apparently obtain no further accommodation.      Unless there-fore the sum of  tLj million approximately can be madeavailable from some source or    other during the next few xdays , the Government must default on its debt.      Moreover, in order to meet the remaining deficit for the current year, and the half:-yearly service of the Debt due on the 1st July 1932, an additional advance of approximately $1,650^000 is estimated to be necessary;    while a further sum of ^350,000 is stated to be urgently required in the immediate future to guard against the risk of a panic withdrawal of Savings Bank deposits which may take place at any moment,50       Thus anyone who undertakes to come to the rescue must be prepared to find at least pfS-ji million during the next 6 months,4U        Failing such assistance, the Newfoundland Government will default on its public debt on the 1st January next, and again on the 1st July 1932, the half-yearly interest in respect of the whole debt falling due on those dates.5,        The public debt consists of approximately  11 million nominal in sterling issues, and some pi&apos;39 million in dollars, of which approximately ^30 million is understood to be due In the U,S,A.- &apos;2 -      .2 &quot;it is stated that the necessary funds ought to be made available by the 15th Deccmbe r,,  in order to prevent a technical&apos; de.fau3.tg/
9^his tJ C&apos;J60        The sterling debt includes  2,014,000 of stocks which arc Trustee Securities under the Colonial Stock Acts. The interest on these stocks is approximately  78,000 per annum0      We of course have no responsibility of any kind for the service of such stocks;    and the Declaration which the Newfoundland Government made, on the occasion of each issue, of its obligation to provide the interest and sinking fund required, expressly stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had no liability in the matter,7.       Nevertheless the failure of a Dominion Government to meet its obligations, particularly in respect of trustee securities, would undoubtedly have a serious effect on Empire Credit generallya      It seems to us however- questionable whether the injury to U.k1  credit would be so great that we should be justified in adding to our own obligations by asking Parlia-ment for authority to lend the money required to prevent a default - say  1 million at current exchange - to which we must add a further sura of say  650,000 to pay off the Banks, whose advances are already overdue, and who would certainly demand immediate repayment if they knew that the U.. Ka Government were standing behind their debtor.      To assume such an obligation towards Newfoundland,  in the face of similar contingencies threatening from other directions^ might constitute, a truly formidable precedent y for example, if the New South Vales Government were to default on its, maturities next year.
9 9 9hJ t) (J8.      In our opinion,  therefore, it must dp left to the Government of Newfoundland to seek assistance, if they can, elsewhere.    There is no prospect of the City being able to - provide them with accommodation, on business grounds;    and it would be impossible for us to ash them to do soo    Their own Bankers - the Bank of Montreal - feel that they would not be justified in providing them with any further accommodation; but they are apparently impressed by the risk of a default and the Newfoundland Government must go back and see if they cannot make terms with them,  after, all *    If not:.  the only alternative to default is for them to approach the Canadian Government and try and obtain assistance, if necessary; at the cost of some political concession-,9o      Tho latest development of which we have heard relates to the operation of the Newfoundland law regarding legal tenderr.    it appears that under tho existing law the only legal tender in Newfoundland is gold,  although ever since the Canadian banks have been operating in the country, the customary currency has been, the bank notes of the 4 bankso    There Is however a legal obligation on the Banks to redeem their notes in gold and to pay depositors in gold, and this obligation is recognised by all the Banks concerned. So far no gold has been supplied for this purpose, though there is evidence that the Newfoundlanders are becoming alive to the advantage which the law gives them, in view of the depreciation of the Canadian dollar on gold; and the Banks, growing alarmed at this contingent liability, have asked the Government to take steps to prohibit tha export of gold and make the notes of the Canadian bants legal tender in Newfoundland-    So far the Government is understood to have refused, and there may be difficulties in the way of emergency legislation for the purpose-    But it is clearly to the interests of both parties to prevent such a banking crisis as &quot;would arise if there were a general attempt to convert notes and deposits-4-
into gold; and it nay &quot;be hoped thet, if the Government play their cards wisely,  they will be able to reach agreement on the footing    that they will legislate to relieve the Banks of their obligation in return for the Banks providing the Newfoundland Government with the accommodation they require during the next 6 monthsn    This of course furnishes an additional reason against our taking any action at the present time in the direction of affording financial assistance.The Governor of Newfoundland has already been advised to the effect of paragraph 8 above    (see telegram of November 28th from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governorj a copy of which is annexed)j    and there would appear to be no further action which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom can usefully take at this stage-(Intdo)    No Go &quot; JoHoTo14th December, 1931-
PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governor of Newfoundlana.* (Sent 4*0 poHU  28th November9 193l)o99fw e3 (JSeer-et and Personal. 1    Reference your telegrams Personal, sad Secret of 24th November.,The following Personal and Secret telegram has &quot;been received from United Kingdom High Commissioner at Qttairuo     Begins, Newfoundland, Referencemy telegram of 21st November,      I was informed this morning &quot;by the Acting Prime Minister that the Canadian Government regret&quot; their own financial commitments make it definitely impossible to give assistance to Newfoundland at the present timso The Acting Prime Minister emphasised that the Cabinet appreciated the gravity cf the situation and that they bad. given the matter most careful and sympathetic consider at ion0Sir Go Perley expressed some surprise that approach had not come direct from Newfoundland Government and was a little inclined to question whether the latter had not sought to: associate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in pressing the appeal on Canada,,      I succeeded in convincing him that this was not the casa but I received the impression that the Canadian Government would prefer direct approach in any future reopening of the subjects    This was the nethod adopted xfjxezx money was provided (my telegram of 82nd Juno, 111) with regard to which Sir G* Parloy mentioned, with, some bitterness that Newfoundland had sent no word of thanks and also in

It would seem that in the circumstances set forth in Clark&apos;s telegram, any further negotiations between the newfoundland Government and Canadian Government could best be conducted direct.,, i^e^ without the United Kingdom High Commissioner as intermediary0     It would seem that the Canadian Government have considered the appeal made to them only from the point of view of providing funds themselves and not from the point of view of using their influence with the Canadian Banks to induce them to continue their financial assistance; No doubt the Newfoundland Government will bear secondpossibility in mind in any approach they may make toforCanadian Governments
