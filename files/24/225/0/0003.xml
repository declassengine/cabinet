HIS DOCUMENTJLS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.)R one o graph ad  for trie Cabinet. November,  1931,CRET. CABINET. COPY NO.       _P. 303   (31) DISMISSAL OF A CIVILIAN EMPLOYEE OF THEAIR MINISTRY ON GROUNDS OF SUBVERSIVE POLITICAL ACTIVITES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. I am sorry to trouble the Cabinet at short noticewith a case which at first blush may seem petty, since all that is involved is the discharge of a single temporary employee at a provincial establishment of the Air Ministry, I feel, however, that I have no option in the matter,  since it is a case which might lend itself to misrepresentation in Parliament or elsewhere and thereby raise troublesome political issues.In order that my colleagues may be in a position to .form a judgment, it will, I think, be most convenient if I set out the case in some detail.2. The individual concerned is a temporary clerk namedJones employed at the Home Aircraft Depot of the Royal Air Force at Henlow.    This depot comprises 1539 Royal Air Force and 197 civilian personnel,  and is an instructional centre where there are a large number of young airmen whom it is most important to preserve from any contamination with doctrines subversive of loyalty and discipline.3. This clerk has for a long time past been suspected,not only by the officers of the depot but by junior non-commissioned personnel with whom he has worked, to be of &quot;communistic&quot; tendencies.    He was reported by the Royal Air Force corporal under whom he worked two years ago to be indulging in an extensive correspondence, which was
generally sealed with a small adhesive stamp hearing the design of the &quot;Hammer and Sickle&quot;.   This b8dge, of course, is beat known as that of the Third International and also of what was a highly dangerous and undesirable organisation, though it is now,  I believe, moribund - the International Workers of the World.    There is no other direct evidence connecting Jones with these organizations, and it is only fair to point out that, in this respect at least, Jones appears to have made no effort to conceal his activities or the nature of his political sympathies.The then Commanding Officer, though far from satisfied,  thought it might be unfair to penalise him on suspicion, and contented himself with transferring him to other duties at Henlow, where he would not be in contact to the same extent with young and impressionable Service personnel.Following on conversations between the Civil and Royal Air Force Police, the present Commanding Officer received recently a police report (reproduced at Appendix A) dated 7th November,  in which it was stated that at a political meeting on October 28th Jones was heard to speak as follows:-&quot;I do not urge the people to violence, but I sympathise with the unemployed who do use violence.&quot; I shall comment further on these words below.This brought matters to a head and the Commanding Officer, having enquired into Jones&apos; whole history, decided that the retention at Henlow, where he had every opportunity of disaffecting young Service personnel, of an individual capable of using language &quot;subversive of law and order&quot; at a public meeting was undesirable.   He was accordingly given oral notice on 17th November, the grounds stated (as reported to the Air Ministry) being that &quot;this unit could not oontinuato employ civilians who....... made statements   as in thePolice Report&quot;.
lie was subsequently given written notice of dismissal which refrained from stating any grounds - see Appendix B - to take effect from the evening of November 26th.Jones&apos; version of the terms of his dismissal is contained in the copies of his letters to Mr. Lansbury and Mr. Griffiths attached as Appendices C and D.   The relevant passages are marked in the margin. 6, The case was brought to the notice of the air council on Wednesday evening last, following urgent represen-tations made to the Under Secretary of State by two Members of Parliament, Sir William Jenkins and Mr. T. Griffiths, the latter of whom has written that he wants &quot;to avoid putting a question down,  if possible&quot;.    In view of the obvious political implications of the case, and the fact that Jones&apos; discharge was due to take place in twenty-four hours&apos; time, it was decided to suspend it for one week,  to allow of further investigation, and those interested in the case (who now include Mr. Lansbury) have been so notified.    It was added that this was strictly without prejudice to the final decision.7, I am anxious to be quite fair to Jones,   and I will therefore say that Sir William Jenkins claims to know him personally and states he bears an excellent character  . Jones has  also forwarded to Mr. Lansbury a series of satis-faotory testimonials,  the most recent of which is, however, over 2i years old.I should also  add that there is no definite evidence that he is a Communist;    this is a matter of suspicion only, though he appears to have been closely connected (and,  to be just, has not, as above stated, sought to conceal his connection) with some organization which utilises the &quot;Hammer and Sickle&quot; emblem.&quot;O
I should perhaps at this point add that there is no regulation which explicitly debars Civil Servants from speaking at political meetings.    It was, of course, stated in the Report of the Board of Enquiry set up in connection with the so-called &quot;Francs case&quot; that:-    &quot;There are spheres of activity legitimately open to the ordinary citizens in which the Civil Servant can play no part,  or only a limited part. Pie is not to indulge in political or party controversy. . ..&quot;This report, however,  though it formulated a number of propositions of general application, related primarily to officials of higher status, and the context makes it perfectly plain that tne reference in this particular passage is to such officials.    It would not,  tnsrefore, be fair to expect a minor clerk at an outstation establishment to be aware of it, or to regard it as necessarily applying to his own case.    He might equally plead ignorance of the traditional understanding governing tiiese matters which has been summarised as follows &quot;It is agreed that political activities are permissible to Civil Servants as long as they are not prominent or overt.&quot; (Official Report,  House of Commons,  30th May,  1927,  Column 158 - but the case of e stablished Civil Servants was then primarily in question.)On the other- hand, I entertain no doubt whatsoever that Jones is a bad influence and that it is not in the public interest that a man of this stamp should continue to be employed at a Service depot containing many young airmen. I would at this point remind my colleagues of the language he used at the meeting on October 25th,  according to the police report - vide paragraph 4 above.   That language is no doubt in some degree ambiguous,  and a clever pleader might seek to put an innocent construction upon it;    but I myself find it
difficult to believe that the intention behind it was innocent rather than inflammatory and one may assume that the police officer who heard it actually delivered was also of this opinion.Morover,  I suggest that after the recent naval incident it behoves us to exercise every possible precaution to protect the personnel of all three Services from corrupting influences.I must further emphasise that to cancel a dismissal already made public, and the grounds of which are common property at this station, is bound to have a very deleterious effect;    it might indeed have serious repercussions on discipline generally.I therefore recommend that the dismissal shall take place so soon as the period of suspension expires,  viz, on Thursday, December 3rd.But I do not conceal from myself - and feel it myduty to bring to my colleagues&apos;  notice - the possibility that this case may, if it is taken up by the Opposition, give us considerable trouble.   There will doubtless be charges ofpolitical victimisation,  such as Jones himself makes.    Inthis connection Sir vSilliam Jenkins,  in a letter to the under Secretary of State, repeats Jones&apos;  allegation that other employees of the depot assisted the ConservativeCandidate.    I have had enquiries made on this point,  andnothing is known of such assistance having been given.   Butit is not the fact that a speech was made at a politicalmeeting of whatever complexion that is the ground fordismissal;    that would not be adequate ground, as the regula-tions stand today,  though a warning to discontinue suchovert and prominent political activities would be justifiable.It is the actual language feeiJ^ in the course of. the speech,coupled with the previous history of the individual, which makes his dismissal in my opinion not only desirable, but necessary.
Finally, arising out of this episode, it would he helpful to me (and I think also to my colleagues at the Admiralty and War Office) to have an up-to-date ruling as to the policy to he pursued in this class of case.I may remind the Cabinet that the existingdirections for dealing with Communists date from some yearsback and are as follows :-&quot;(a)    Persons who can be shown by reasonable evidence to be actively engaged in the dissemination of anti-constitutional and revolutionary propaganda, either oral or written, should be discharged forthwith and without pension or other super-annuation benefit;(b)    Persons who merely label themselves as Communists1without talcing any active part in the furtherance of Communism should be eliminated as and when opportunity offers, i.e. by discharge on reduction.&quot;Jones cannot be accused, on the information in my possession,  even of :,labelling himself a Communist&quot;;    his letters reproduced, in Appendices G and D by implication deny that he is one.      It is perhaps the more unfortunate that course (b) was not followed in his case,  though I doubt whether the same charges of political victimisation would not never-theless have been forthcoming.It would be convenient if the Cabinet would renew these directions,  if they are considered equally applicable to-day.     Moreover, I should also like a ruling as to whether speaking at a public political meeting of whatever complexion is or is not to be regarded as legitimate in the case of lower grade Civil Servants, whether established or unestablished.      It is extraordinarily difficult to define where the borderline between what is and what is not permissible to employees of the State in the way of political activities is to be drawn.      It may be argued that more precise definition is undesirable,  even if it were practicable.      On
Air Ministry, L.November 27th, 1931.the other hand, a speech at a public political meeting is a specific form of activity which, so far as definition goes, it is easy either to permit or proscribe;    and uncertainty in such a matter may well give rise to serious difficulties in the future.12. In sum I ask my colleagues three questions :-(l)       Is Jones&apos; dismissal to stand?(2)       Do the directions quoted in paragraph 11 above as regards Communists still hold? (3)        Is the delivery of speeches at public political meetings permissible to lower grade Civil Servants, whether established or unestabliohed? An immediate answer to question (1) is essential. About questions (2) and (3) there is no immediate urgency,  so far as I am concerned,  and they can be reserved, if desirable, for future consideration.
Sir,I beg to report that on Monday/, October 28th/ 1931, I was on duty at a Labour Meeting, held &quot;Stt Arlesey.,-^standinat the rear of the audience.Whilst Mr. Jones of Kenlow was speaking I heard him make use of the following sentence,  &quot;I do not urge the people to violence, but I sympathise with the unemployed who do use violence&quot;.sentence.There was no comment from the audience at thisI am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   William   C. Vintner.P.0.5.Mr. Supt. I-I.W. Church, D.G.G. , County Police Office, Biggieswade.Respectfully submitted for the information of theChief Constable, Shire Hall, Bedford.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)    Hy. Church, Superintendent, &amp; D.C.C.Bedfordshire Constabulary. gleswade Division. 3iggleswade Station.7th November,  193j
Mr. G. Jones,Temporary civilian Clerk, Grade 3.In confirmation of verbal notice givenyou by the Depot Adjutant on 17th November, 1931,herewith written notice,  terminating your employmentwith this Unit, with effect from Friday, 27th November,1931.       Last day of work 26th November.(Sgd.)    Geo. Pyne,Civilian Assistant, for Group Captain, Commanding, H.A.D., ROYAL   AIR   FORCE.Henlow Gamp,    Beds. 19th november er, 1951.
4, High Street, H E N LOW, Beds.19th November, 1931.To:-The Right Honourable G. Lansbury, House of Commons.Dear Sir,I trust you will pardon the liberty I take in addressing you at a time when it is easy to imagine the number and importance of the matters competing for your notice and when you are &quot;burdened with the responsibility of leading the Opposition in the House. But I write to you for advice in a matter which is of paramount importance to myself and which I feel sure will not be without some interest to you.      I take this course on the advice of the-Editor of the Daily Herald who assures me that you will give my grievance your kindly consideration.For the past three years I have been employed as a &quot;Temporary Civilian Cleric&quot; &quot;&quot;aF&quot;tne Home Aircraft Depot, R.A.F. Henlow Camp, and during that period I have never heard a word of complaint as to my ability and character, and I have always given complete satisfaction to the Officer under whose personal supervision I have worked for two 3/ears.      On Monday last I received telephonic instructions to report to th^Cpmmandinjg-Officer ja^ Headguar,ters.     There I was questioned re my name, address&apos;and period of employment.      I was then informed that he had been furnished with a report of a speech I made three week or a month ,ago at Ariesey (a village three miles away)^noT&quot;that portion of this speech was considered detrimental to the best interest of the Serving Forces, and in consequence I was given notice to terminate my employment.      I asked to be allowed to see-the report or to be furnished with a copy of same, but my request was most curtly refused.      I was helpless to appeal in any way.      I consider this most unjust treatment.      My dismissal in this   manner will  jeopardise my chances of ever obtaining work with a private firm.      I emphatically deny that anything in my speech could in any way have been considered Seditious, and if such had been the case, why didn&apos;t the Police take Direct Action and not wait for a month before forwarding a report to my employers?     1 have every reason to believe that I am being deliberately victimised for having dared to address an audience from the Labour Platform.      Today, I received my notice in writing and enclose a cop;/ for your perusal.      You will note, Sir, that no mention has &quot;been made of the reason for ^Vj^smis&amp;al and no move has been made to supply with a&quot; copy of the alleged Police Report.I appeal to you for your assistance and advice in this matter.      Perhaps it would be possible for you to bring my case to the notice of Sir Phillip Sassoon and ask him to obtain a copy of this Police report or the real reason for my discharge.      I claim seniority over many other Civilian Clerks now employed on this Depot and although I realise that the Government policy is to discharge all Civilians who are not e.x-R.A.F.  it is quite unfair- that I should be singled out first.PoT,0.
It may interest you to know, Sir, that I have teen connected with the Labour Movement for the past 15 years and have always worked hard in furthering the Labour Party policy.      I am a native of South Wales and was drafted into this area under the Ministry of Labour scheme in 1929.      In the past, I have been employed at the National Oil Refineries, Neath, Neath Rural District Council offices, and various other offices.      Furthermore, I am a cripple and will be unable to do any manual labour.      The prospects of returning to South Wales, where the suffering of my fellow workers is so great appals me.      Should you require a testimonial as to my personal  character I would refer you to Sir William Jenkins, Mr. D.G. Davies, J.P,, Feath, or I shall be pleased to furnish you with copies of testimonials from past employers and many gentlemen of standing in my home town.      I shall also be pleased to furnish you with any further information you may require appertaining to my case.I appeal to you as a father, as a friend, and as an humanitarian.Yours faithfully, (Signed)   G.B. Jones.
Dear Sir,I hasten to write to you bringing to your notice my grievance and feel sure that after you have read same, you will give me your kind and valuable advice and assistance.   As yet, I have not had the pleasure of meeting you, but I am fairly well known to your brothers at Neath, and am a native myself of your own home-town.For the past three years I have been employed at the Home Aircraft Depot, Henlow Camp, Beds, as a Temporary Civilian Clerk, and until this week I have never had a word of complaint made regarding my work or character.    However, on Monday last I was instructed to report to the Commanding Officer at Depot Headquarters.    There I was questioned by the Depot Adjutant.    I was asked my name, address, period of service etc. having answered satisfactorily, the Adjutant asked me if, during the General Election I assisted the Labour Candidate for the Mid-Beds Division.    My reply was ihTne affirmative.   Well, he said, I have a report here from the Civil Police of the speech you made at Arlesey a month ago. and we consider that it is detrimental to the best interests of the Serving Forces and therefore you are dismissed.    I asked him to be allowed to see this report or to be provided with a copy of same.    This request was refused.    I was amazed and indignant.    I had no ways in which to appeal and I am now faced with unemployment.    My discharge on Monday was verbally and I was forced to wait until today for same to be tendered in writing.    I have received this notice, and beg to forward a copy for your perusal.     You will note that no reason is stated &quot;In Writing&quot; for my being discharged.I interviewed my Section Commanding Officer this morning&apos;with a view to obtaining an interview with the Commanding Officer, Home Aircraft Depot, so that I may have the reason for my discharge in writing.    To say the least, my CO. was curt, and advised me to leave the matter drop as no good could come from interviewing the CO.    I asked him if he could tell me the reasons for my discharge, and after much wrangling he stated that it was they considered my political views too contrary to the needs of the Government.    In other words, I am being VICTIMISED for having delivered a speech on behalf of the Labour Party.    I contend that I would not have been discharged had I spoken from the Conservative platform.    I now await an opportunity of seeing the Depot Commanding Officer.If I am discharged in this manner, my prospects of obtaining work under a private employer are very remote, as the charge against me, if carefully interpreted is Sedition.    I am faced with unemployment for holding political views opposed to those held by CO.    I am left to face the future with my chances of obtaining work jeopardised because of this unfair charge.    I say, Unfair, because had the speech I made at Arlesey been in mgr any way detrimental to the best interest of the Government, why didn&apos;t the Police take action immediately,  and not wait until ONE MONTH after the delivery of the speech to victimise me through my employers.P. T . 0 .4, High Street, HENLOW, Beds.20th November, 1931.Mr. Tom Griffiths, M.P. House of Commons.
I write to you, Sir, for your advice and guidance, as a friend, a fellow-countryman, as a comrade in the same movemen and feel confident my appeal for assistance will not he in ^vainI may add that I am a young man (age 30) and single. My moral character will hear the strictest investigation, and I hold references from past employers and gentlemen of standing ii Heath.    I have been actively interested in the-labour Movement for the past 15 years and have, at different times been Secreta of the Skewen Labour Party and the Heath Abbey I.L.P.    I would also.,state, that unfortunately I am a cripple and will be unablf do manual labour of any kind and I dread the thoughts of again having to line up with my fellow workers to draw Unemployment Benefit.    I want work, have the ability to work and demand work, I have always given the best of, my services to all who have employed me, and have never been discharged for any unhonourable reason.    I have been employed in the past at the National Oil Refineries Ltd., Skewen, Heath Rural District Council Office, at for a short period worked on the surface at a colliery at Brynco Prom the foregoing, you can well understand why I hold my preset political views, for after all, man is governed by his environme and mine has been a working class environment.It may be possible that you may be able to get into touch with someone in authority and bring my case to their no tic or-on the other hand, your kind advice will always be gratefully accepted.    I therefore trust you will be able to-- give my grievance your full and sympathetic consideration.Hoping I may have the honour of hearing from you Inreply.:Yours&apos; faithfully, (Sgd.) Gwyn B. Jones.P.S.7       My notice terminates on Thursday next,  the 26th inst.The; address I give- you la- the place where I-at-present dig..-&apos; I intend holding on ih:&apos;/Mis- area until I get justice done&apos;, and&apos;&apos; -therefore may have ..-&quot;t&apos;o;; dr;aw Unemployment Benefit at the Local Label Exchange.    Immediate action will be necessary If I am to have my! case fully reviewed.
