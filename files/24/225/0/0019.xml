THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.9CP. 319 (31).CABINET.CONVENTION TO IMPROVE THE MEANS OF PREVENTING WAR.I SHOULD deprecate, for the reasons given in the annexed Memorandum, a Cabinet decision at this time against signing this Convention. If France and Germany sign, and we do not, the role of Britain at the Disarmament Conference becomes more difficult than ever. Sir W. Malkin&apos;s opinion meets a good deal of the anxiety experienced by the Chiefs of Staff on particular points; in paragraph 3 he puts the broad issue very clearly. If the decision is for signature, we should only ratify along with other Powers, and should make the reservation that our assent depends on the coming into force of a general Disarmament Convention.J. S.Foreign Office, December 15, 1931.Convention to Improve the Means of Preventing War.IN 1928 the German Delegate on the League Committee on Arbitration and Security (an offshoot of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference) submitted a &quot;Draft Model Treaty,&quot; the main principle of which was that signatories would bind themselves to accept and carry out the recommendations of the Council in the event of a threat of war arising between them, and, in particular, in the event of hostilities, at the request of the Council.The draft was criticised by the British Delegate, who, however, did not oppose its adoption on the basis of a model which States might, if they would, adopt and put in force as between themselves; he was opposed to the opening for signature of a general convention.The draft was referred to Governments for examination, and came before the Assembly of that year.The Assembly adopted a resolution which &quot; recommends it for consideration by States Members or non-Members of the League of Nations; and hopes that it may serve as a basis for States desiring to conclude a treaty of this kind.&quot;On this occasion the British Delegate indicated that his Government still entertained some misgivings, and could hold out no hope that they would be able to sign a document of this kind.Though the draft Model Treaty was approved by the Assembly, it was not, in fact, made use of by any Government.In the summer of 1929, when the Labour Government came into office, they decided that the draft Model Treaty contained elements that would contribute towards the organisation of peace, and Mr. Henderson, at the Assembly of that year, announced that the British Delegation would press for the conversion of the Model Treaty into a General Convention to be opened for signature at Geneva. 6122   [6319] b
At the Assembly in that year, and at the subsequent Assembly, there was protracted and detailed discussion of the terms of the draft, which was remitted for final study to a special committee which met at Geneva in May last.The draft as agreed by that Committee came before the Assembly last September, and, after amendment, was finally approved, and the convention was opened for signature.The Labour Government were prepared to sign the Convention, but by the time the Assembly met last September the neAV Government had not had sufficient opportunity of examining the matter to enable them to decide whether they could sign. Lord Cecil was therefore instructed that, while he might take part in the discussion of the draft, and endeavour to. secure amendments which were thought to be necessary, he should give no undertaking in regard to signature on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.As regards the Dominion Governments, they were all informed at the end of July last that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were prepared to sign, and they were asked whether they concurred. Replies were received from New Zealand and Australia only. Both those Governments expressed doubts as to certain articles in the draft doubts which we endeavoured to dispel. But we obtained nothing definite from any of them before the Assembly met.At the Assembly, New Zealand announced that they were instructed to accept the text with certain minor amendments. The South African delegate announced that he was definitely empowered to sign the convention. He con-suited us, however, and on finding that we were not prepared to sign he withheld his signature.Up to the present the Convention has been signed by Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and Uruguay, but no ratifications have been announced.The text approved by the Assembly in September of this year has been criticised by the Chiefs of Staff, who advise that, in the light of these criticisms, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not sign the convention. A note by Sir W. Malkin, Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, examining the criticisms of the Chiefs of Staff is annexed.From the purely political point of view, the Foreign Office would like to emphasise the following points in addition to those put forward by Sir W. Malkin in the first five paragraphs of his note :  (1) It was His Majesty&apos;s Government who, in 1929, took the lead in turning the original German proposal into a general convention.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government were chiefly responsible for obtaining an agreed text of the convention in May last.(3) Both the French and German Governments intend to sign the convention before the 2nd February next, and the Germans will probably sign it within the next few days.(4) The Labour Government held that the Convention fulfilled a useful though modest role in the machinery for preventing war, and that solidarity with the French and German Governments in signing the convention would be a good preparation for the Disarmament Con-ference. Certainly refusal to sign, now that we know that the French and Germans intend to do so, could not but produce an unfortunate effect especially as we have taken the lead in its negotiation.(5) Signature does not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government definitely as the convention requires ratification before becoming effective, and our ratification could be made dependent upon ratification by other Powers, or indeed withheld altogether.(6) Lord Cecil made it clear to the Committee in May that it was not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow the convention to enter into force so far as they were concerned prior to the coming into force of a general Disarmament Convention.Foreign Office, December 11, 1931.
Note by Sie W. Malkin.1. Before considering the particular points to which the memorandum of the Chiefs of Staff sub-committee calls attention, I may perhaps be allowed to make one or two general observations (none the less important because they are obvious) which seem to me to govern the whole consideration of this question.2. The object of the draft Convention is to strengthen the hands of the Council of the League in their efforts to prevent a possible outbreak of war, by conferring on the Council (acting unanimously except for the parties to the dispute) certain powers in relation to the forces of the disputants. Under article 2 the Council can prescribe the evacuation of the territory of one disputant by the forces of the other which may have entered it, and under article 3 the Council may fix lines which must not be passed by the forces of those disputants. The object is to enable the Council to stop fighting which may have begun and to ensure that no further fighting takes place while it is endeavouring to settle the question.3. It is obvious that the acceptance of such a convention by any State may mean that in certain circumstances it will have to take action which, if it had had a free hand, it would certainly not have taken. And therefore the argument that a particular provision of the convention might in certain circumstances have the effect of prejudicing the military position of the State concerned is an argument not so much against the propriety of that particular provision, but against the whole idea of having any such convention. It seems, in fact, that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the draft convention must depend on which of two possible general attitudes they adopt. They may consider, on the one hand, that, since &quot; the maintenance of peace is the greatest British interest,&quot; and in view of our possible commitments (under Locarno or article 16 of the Covenant) in the event of war, our policy should be to strengthen the hands of the Council in their task of preventing Avar by every suitable means. In that case we should be in favour of proposals such as those embodied in the draft Convention, unless it could be shown that in our particular case they involve risks so serious as to outweigh the general advantage of increasing the likelihood of the preservation of peace. Or, on the other hand, they may consider that, in vieAv of the special position of this country, Avith its world-wide responsibilities, it is impossible to accept any obligations Avhich might have the effect of fettering our action in a time of crisis. On that vieAv, no amendment could make the Convention acceptable; the whole idea of such a scheme must be rejected.4. It does not seem possible in practice to combine the benefits of both attitudes by taking the line that it is an excellent thing for small and quarrelsome countries to accept the Convention (see paragraph 12 of the Chiefs of Staff memorandum), but that it is impossible for a country like ours to do so. It would be difficult to persuade the small and quarrelsome countries that the risks, which under the Convention they might have to take in connection with the defence of their own territories, are not as serious for them as those which our acceptance of the Convention might involve for this country in distant parts of the world are for us.5. The choice between these alternative attitudes is a matter for the Cabinet. All that I can do is to examine the particular points raised by the Chiefs of Staff and endeavour to show what is the effect of the draft Convention upon them.8. Paragraph 15 of the Chiefs of Staffs memorandum suggests that the alteration which has been made in the opening words of article 2 may have the effect of giving a wider application to the article. I do not think that the alteration really has any such effect; it was apparently made only to make it plain that the article did not apply where a state of war actually existed, and the whole Convention must be read in the light of the preamble, which speaks of &quot; increasing the efficacy of the means of preventing war,&quot; and thereby makes it plain that what is contemplated is a situation where the Council is endeavouring under article 11 to prevent a possible outbreak of war.
7. The particular instances to which the Chiefs of Staff memorandum calls, attention in regard to article 2 are as follows : (a) China (paragraphs 16 and 23). On the wording of article 2 as it stands,. I do not think that the Council would be entitled to prescribe the withdrawal from China of British forces which were actually in the country at the time when the trouble arose. It would, I think, be possible for the Council to prescribe the withdrawal of reinforcements which had entered China during the trouble, or (as suggested in paragraph 23 of the memorandum) for it to fix lines beyond which the British forces were not to pass under article 3. The case, however, which the Chiefs of Staff have apparently in mind is where it became necessary to employ British forces for the protection of British lives and property in China, and since in that event it is almost certain that the corresponding interests of at any rate the more important Powers would also be involved, it seems most unlikely that, even if China had brought the matter before the Council and called for the application of the Convention, the Council would unanimously prescribe the withdrawal of the forces concerned. It can hardly be suggested, for instance, that if the Convention had been in operation at the time of the dispatch of the Shanghai Defence Force, the Council would unanimously have decreed its with-drawal. I agree, however, that the situation might be different if the dispute were exclusively one between China and ourselves, and the interests of no other country were affected.(b) Persia?! Gulf (paragraph 16). As the possibility of the Council having to deal with a dispute between ourselves and the Trucial Chiefs can presumably be disregarded, it is only necessary to consider the case of Persia. If, owing to Southern Persia falling into a state of chaos, it became necessary to land forces for the protection of the Anglo-Persian oilfields, and Persia brought the matter before the Council, it would be open to the Council under article 2 to prescribe the withdrawal of the forces in question. Whether the Council would unanimously decide to do so would presumably depend on the view they took as to the reasonableness of our action.(c) Egypt (paragraph 17.) The situation contemplated is one in which we maintain permanently a force in Egypt, either, as at present, in virtue of the &quot;reserved points,&quot; or as the result of a treaty settlement. Under the original wording of the article it might have been possible, in the event of either Egypt or ourselves being involved in a dispute with a third State, for the Council to prescribe the withdrawal of those forces, even though Egypt had no desire that this should be clone. The article has now been altered so as to eliminate this possibility, and the situation now contemplated by the Chiefs of Staff is the quite different one of a dispute between Egypt and ourselves. I think that the present wording makes it sufficiently clear that the article only applies where the forces of one party to the dispute have entered the territory of the other during the course of the dispute, and that, therefore, the Council could not call for the withdrawal of the forces permanently maintained in Egypt. I think it would be possible for the Council to call for the withdrawal of any reinforcements which had been sent into Egypt during the course of the dispute. If, however, the strength of the forces to be maintained in Egypt had, as the Chiefs of Staff suggest, been regulated by treaty, and forces to that strength were previously in Egypt, such action by the Council would not deprive us of any right which we-previously possessed. If, moreover, the cause which led to the despatch of reinforcements was an outbreak of disorder which threatened foreign lives and property in Egypt, it is unlikely that the Council would unanimously decide to call for the withdrawal of the British troops.(d) Iraq (paragraph 14). The position here is much the same as in the case of Egypt, though the likelihood of foreign interests being affected by an outbreak of disorder is no doubt less.(e) The Chiefs of Staff suggest that, by signing the Convention, &quot; we shall lose the freedom of action that we safeguarded before adhering to the Briancl-Kellogg Pact&apos;&apos; (paragraph 19). I do not think that this consideration really arises. The object of the so-called &quot;reservations&quot; to the Kellogg Pact was to retain the liberty to go to war in defence of any one of certain unstated countries, which, not being a party to the Pact, was attacked by a State which was a party.  As the Convention deals only with the situation before an outbreak
of war, when the Kellogg Pact ex hypothesi has not come into application, there seems no need to safeguard our position in the wray that was necessary under the Pact. Moreover, our &quot;reservations&quot; to the Pact have now lost practically all their importance, since all the countries which we had particularly in mind, except Iraq, are now parties to the Pact, and Iraq is expected to become a party shortly. *8. The particular instances to which the Chiefs of Staff memorandum calls attention in regard to article 3 are as follows : (a) Paragraph 21. I agree that under the present text of the Convention the power of the Council to draw lines is not dependent upon a prior entry having taken place.   This is expressly stated in M. Madariaga&apos;s report.(b) Paragraph 22. I agree that the article does not deal with the situation in which the party whose forces are in question does not agree with the proposals of the Council, but, as a matter of construction, I think it is impossible to deduce from a provision that &quot; the Council shall fix lines with the consent of the party whose forces are affected &quot; the conclusion that the Council can fix the lines without the consent of that party, and I think, therefore, that, notwithstanding the provision under which the Council is to &quot; determine the period within which the said lines shall be fixed under the conditions specified above,&quot; the provision can only be interpreted in the sense that the consent of the party is necessary before the Council can lay down the lines.(c) Paragraph 25. I agree that under article 5 of the Convention if a party &quot; violates the measures defined in articles 2 and 3 &quot; and war breaks out as a con-sequence of this violation, this is to be regarded as prima facie evidence that the party concerned has resorted to war within the meaning of article 16.9. Article 9 (paragraph 28). The Chiefs of Staff suggest that the provision expressly safeguarding the right of free passage through the Suez Canal might not be regarded as covering air forces. As the passage of air forces through the air is not affected by the Suez Canal Convention, what is contemplated is no doubt the transit of such forces by ship. I do not think that there is anything in this point. It is true that the Suez Canal Convention does not provide for the passage of air forces, but then no more does it provide in terms for the ptNssage of land forces. What it does provide is (article 1) that the Canal is to be free and open in time of war as in time of peace &quot; to every vessel of commerce or of war without distinction of flag.&quot; As the vessels carrying the air forces must either be vessels of commerce or of war, they must be entitled to free passage under the terms of the Convention.H. W. M.December 8, 1931.* The only possible case then left outstanding&apos; would be the Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf.[6319]c
