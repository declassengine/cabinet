[This Document is the Pro-party of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.      0CP. 320 (31).CABINET.EXTRA-TERRITORIALITY IN CHINA.IF the Cabinet approves, I should propose now to send to our Minister at Nanking a telegram as below.This is a long and complicated story, and I annex a Foreign Office memorandum which gives the main course of events. The four essential points to bear in mind are : (1) That successive British Governments during the last five years have announced their view that the system of extra-territoriality now in force in China cannot continue indefinitely, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government was ready to co-operate in a change.(2) That Sir Miles Lampson was authorised to negotiate and settle a draft treaty. The scheme approved by the Cabinet in June was one under which extra-territoriality would come to an end after a time limit of ten years in Shanghai and five years in Tientsin.(3) That the disruption of the Chinese Government and the disturbed condition of Chinese internal affairs make it manifestly undesirable, and, indeed, impossible, to carry matters further at present. In any case, our acceptance of such a treaty would be conditioned by other Powers entering into similar arrangements.(4) The treaty stipulates for most-favoured-nation treatment for ourselves.J. S.Foreign Office, December 15, 1931.Draft Telegram to Nanking.(No.     .) Foreign Office, December    , 1931.YOUR telegrams Nos. 372 and 385 of 7th and 12th December: Extra-territorial itv-------------.---------^ .1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have now considered the question of extra-territoriality. By winding up the negotiations in June last, the late Government secured a strong tactical position from which to face any new situation that may arise during the period of political chaos that, as was then foreseen, lay ahead. In order to avoid any weakening of that position, and in view of the practical certainty that the Chinese will take the initiative in going back on the terms of the draft treaty, it seems desirable to adopt the attitude that the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government are or are not prepared to sign6124   [6325] &apos; b
the draft treaty, or any similar question, cannot arise until negotiations have been actually resumed, and that such, resumption cannot take place for a considerable time to come. His Majesty&apos;s Government have carried their negotiations to the furthest possible point, and the whole question must, therefore, remain in abeyance until negotiations with other Powers have made similar progress and until there seems some probability that China will be able to implement any treaty that may result from such negotiations. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs approaches you again on the subject, you should indicate that that is the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to adopt. It would, however, be better to avoid taking any initiative in the subject.2. As regards the Mandate of the 4th May, you should take an early opportunity of stating to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, while Plis Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer entirely to ignore the Mandate, and do not therefore demand its rescission, they would take a most serious view of any attempt by the Chinese Government or by any misguided local official to enforce the Mandate on the 1st January, or, indeed, at any time before negotiations on the subject of extra-territoriality have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion and an agreement has come into force. Any such attempt would be firmly resisted. His Majesty&apos;s Government would not hesitate to take what measures were open to them to maintain the treaty privileges of their nationals, and they have no doubt that other Governments, with whom they are in consultation on the subject, would join them in such measures.Memorandum on the Extra-territoriality Negotiations with China.1. The general lines of British policy in China, to which successive: Governments in this country have adhered during the last five years, were laid down in a memorandum addressed to the Washington Powers on the 18th December, 1926. The relevant passages in this document, commonly known as the December Memorandum, are as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that [the Governments of the Washington Treaty Powers] shall issue a statement .... declaring their readiness to negotiate on treaty revision and all other outstanding questions as soon as the Chinese themselves have constituted a Government with authority to negotiate; and stating their intention, pending the establish-ment of such a Government to pursue a constructive policy in harmony with the spirit of the Washington Conference developed and adapted to meet the altered circumstances of the present time.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that, in this joint declaration, the Powers should make it clear that, in their constructive policy, they desire to go as far as possible towards meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Chinese nation. They should abandon the idea that the economic and political development of China could only be secured under foreign tutelage, and should declare their readiness to recognise her right to the enjoyment of tariff autonomy as soon as she herself should have settled and promulgated a national tariff. They should expressly disclaim any intention of forcing- foreign control upon an unwilling China. While calling upon China to maintain that respect for the sanctity of treaties which is the primary obligation common to all civilised States, the Powers should yet recognise both the essential justice of the Chinese claim for treaty revision and the difficulty under present conditions of negotiating new treaties in place of the old, and they should therefore modify their traditional attitude of rigid insistence on the strict letter of- treaty rights. During this possibly very prolonged period of uncertainty the Powers can only, in the view of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, adopt an expectant attitude and endeavour to shape the developments as far as possible in conformity with the realities of the situation, so that ultimately, when treaty revision becomes possible, it will be found that part at least of the revision has been effected on satisfactory lines. .... The declaration should show that it is the policy of the Powers to endeavour to maintain harmonious relations
Avith China, without Avaiting for, or insisting upon, the prior establishment of a strong Central Government.&quot;It is the earnest hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Powers will agree to adopt the principles of the policy outlined above and apply them to the realities of the present situation.&quot;2. The true meaning of this new policy was explained and emphasised in a speech by the then Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, at Birmingham, on the 31st January, 1927.   The relevant portions of this speech are as follows : -&quot; We realise, no less than the most patriotic Chinese nationalists, that old treaties are out of date, and we desire to put our relations with China on a basis suitable to the times in which we live. We have long felt that there must be a change, and we hope that it will be possible to negotiate the arrangements for this change with a China that is under one Central Government. There is no such Government in China to-day. But the demand for treaty revision is becoming, or has become, so insistent, and is fundamentally so reasonable, that, in spite of all the difficulties involved by the prevailing dissensions among the Chinese, we must try to negotiate this change with the contending Government even in the midst of civil war. That this Avas our intention was made perfectly clear in a memorandum of British policy which was published on the 26th December. It is difficult, in such circumstances, to pursue the policy, but Ave shall persevere in the attempt, because we feel that it is the right and the only thing to do. The principal matters which the Chinese desire to see changed in the old treaty are, first, the extra-territorial position of all foreigners in China, by which they can only be tried in their own courts and by their own laws; secondly, the tariff provisions, which prevent China from raising duties on foreign goods; and, thirdly, the quasi-independent status of the foreign concessions. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared for change in all these points, for the present system is antiquated. It is unsuited for the conditions of to-day, and it no longer provides the necessary security or protection for the peaceful avocations of our merchants.&quot;3. The events which led up to these declarations of policy Avere briefly as follows :  When China was prevailed upon to declare Avar against the Central PoAvers she was promised that the Allied Governments would do all that rests with them to ensure that China should enjoy in international relations the position and regard due to a great country. China&apos;s main object in entering the Avar was to secure a seat at the Peace Conference to be held at the close of the Avar. She expected that this promise would then prove to be of great Aralue. Her delegates attended the Peace Conference and submitted a memorandum on a number of matters such as foreign troops in China, foreign post-offices, extra-territoriality, leased territories, settlements and concessions and tariff autonomy, Avhich in the opinion of the Chinese Government required readjustment. She Avas unable to induce the Great Powers at the conference to give these proposals their consideration. The Chinese delegates further put forward a claim for the direct restitution to China of Kiaochiao and other German rights in Shantung. This claim Avas rejected. German rights were transferred to Japan and the Chinese delegates thereupon refused to sign the Versailles Treaty.4. The Chinese came avvay from Paris feeling very bitterly that they had been betrayed and anti-foreign feeling in China was greatly exacerbated. An attempt to remedy these grievances Avas made at the Washington Conference of 1921-22. China received satisfaction in some directions, but not in others and most unfortunately France seized the opportunity to carry out a piece of political blackmail. Being engaged in what is known as the gold franc dispute with China, she delayed for three and a half years ratification of the instrument under Avhich the Tariff Conference and Extra-territoriality Commission Avere to be set up. In the meantime, the Chinese Nationalist movement had fallen under Bolshevik influence, and the shooting incident in Shanghai on the 30th May, 1925, had let loose a violent and most destructive anti-British campaign all over China.5.   The Tariff Conference thus opened at Peking on the 26th October, 1925, under the worst possible auspices.   And when the instructions of the British [6325] b 2
delegates were drafted, the minds of His Majesty&apos;s Government were still working in terms of the old dispensation. They contemplated no radical changes in the political situation or in the relations between China and the Powers; they still thought of using their influence to promote an orderly and united China, and of ensuring that the Powers&apos; control over customs revenues should be exercised with this end in view; they still contemplated &quot;granting&quot; her a moderate increase in revenue, attaching thereto such conditions as would make the concession beneficial to China as a whole and so manifest to China the benevolence of their intentions. In the course of the next twelve months the bankruptcy of these ideas was brought home to those who have to frame British foreign policy by the failure of the Tariff Conference itself, by the growth of Bolshevik influence, the increasing violence of the anti-British feeling in China and the damage inflicted in consequence on British interests by boycotts directed with a bitterness and persistence never before seen in China. Between May 1925 and December 1926 the position in China especially so far as British interests were concerned had become well-nigh desperate. A new orientation of British policy in China had thus become a matter of imperative necessity. This new policy was announced to the world in the December memorandum and the Birmingham speech referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.6. It took some little time for the Chinese to realise that the phrases of the December memorandum and the Birmingham speech were not mere empty words, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government meant exactly what they said; but when it was seen that His Majesty&apos;s Government steadily availed themselves of every opportunity to implement the policy of the December memorandum by the rendition of concessions, the refusal to use the Shanghai Defence Force except for purely defensive purposes, the settlement of the Nanking incident, our attitude towards Chinese revenues and the Customs and Salt Administration, &amp;c, and later on by our policy in regard to such long-standing grievances as tariff autonomy and the Shanghai Court -a welcome change came over the scene. The disappearance of the Russian influence during 1927 ended a serious menace to British interests; hostility gave way to friendly feelings, and since about the end of 1927 our relations with China have been on a most friendly and harmonious footing, and our interests in China have benefited accordingly.7. In 1928 came the final triumph of the Nationalist movement. The Peking Government disappeared and the present Government was established at Nanking in October 1928. The Powers quickly recognised the Nanking Govern-ment as the Government of China and proceeded to sign treaties granting China tariff autonomy. This was the prelude to the consideration of the question of extra-territoriality, which was, and still is, the main question at issue between China and the Powers. On the 23rd April, 1929, the Chinese Government addressed a formal request to the Powers to agree to the abolition of extra-territoriality. We endeavoured to induce the Chinese Government to put forward concrete proposals to serve as a basis of discussion, and the Chinese warily abstained from doing so. Towards the end of 1929 the exigencies of domestic politics as so often happens in China produced a crisis in her international relations. The Nanking Government had committed themselves to the date the 1st January, 1930, as the date when extra-territoriality was to be abolished. When this date approached and detailed negotiations had not yet been begun it became evident that the Nanking Government might be driven in order to strengthen their position in the eyes of their own people-to abolish extra-territoriality by unilateral action. It was thought that, if serious negotiations could be initiated during November or December, the danger might be averted, but Sir M. Lampson was opposed to proceeding^ to Nanking for this purpose. The Secretary of State, therefore, on the 20th December, 1929, handed to the Chinese Minister, for transmission to his Government, an aide-memoire, the object of which was to save the face of the Chinese Government and help them out of a serious difficulty, by enabling them to issue the threatened unilateral denunciation of extra-territoriality in an innocuous form. The aide-memoire stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to agree that the 1st January, 1930, could be treated as the date &quot; from which the process of the gradual abolition of extra-territoriality should be regarded as having commenced in
principle,&quot; and would have no objection to any declaration conformable with that attitude which the Chinese Government might think it desirable to issue.8. After a preliminary exchange of views, Sir M. Lampson on the 30th March, 1930, prepared the first draft of a treaty for the abolition of extra-territoriality to serve as a basis for future negotiations. At this stage the position of the Chinese Government once more became uncertain owing to the threat of civil war, and for some months they were content to allow the question of extra-territoriality to recede into the background. During this interval the details of the draft treaty were carefully considered in consultation with the State Department in Washington. In the late summer the dramatic intervention of Chang Hsueh Liang, the young marshal, put an end to the menace of civil war, and the Chinese Government appeared to be more firmly established. Extra-territoriality immediately became a vital issue once more. On the 11th September, 1930, Sir M. Lampson presented the draft treaty to Dr. Wang. In December the Chinese Government presented a counter-draft both to us and to the United States Government (with whom we were acting in the closest accord), and detailed negotiations on the basis of our draft began early in 1931.9. By May 1931 Sir Miles Lampson had negotiated all the details of a draft treaty which, in the opinion of the Foreign Office and of the commercial interests most closely concerned (who had been consulted at all the important stages of the negotiations), represented a satisfactory solution of the extra-territoriality problem. The most difficult point of all was the question of the reserved areas. His Majesty&apos;s Government, had been holding out for the exclusion for an indefinite period from the operation of the treaty of Shanghai and Tientsin, the two chief centres of foreign municipal administration and of foreign trade and residence in China. By the end of May Sir M. Lampson had secured from Dr. Wang an offer to exclude Greater Shanghai and Greater Tientsin (namely, areas much greater than the areas of actual foreign administration) for periods of ten and five years respectively. In the meantime, however, there had occurred a crisis in domestic politics which once again disturbed the course of China&apos;s foreign relations. A quarrel between the two wings of the Kuomintang (or Nationalist party) led to the arrest by President Chiang Kai-shek of his chief opponent, the Cantonese leader Hu Han-min. Shortly afterwards the Chinese Government had to face their critics at a public Kuomintang Congress which opened at Nanking on the 5th May. To strengthen themselves, the Chinese Government issued on 4th May a mandate decreeing the unilateral abolition of extra-territoriality on the 1st January, 1932. In spite of this bid for popular support, the Cantonese members of the Government seceded and proceeded to Canton, where they set up a separatist Government. It seemed probable that another cycle of civil wars was about to set in and Dr. Wang himself acknow-ledged that in the circumstances it was impossible for him to sign any treaty. The whole problem was submitted to the late Cabinet by Mr. Arthur Henderson on the 2nd June, 1931. In conformity with the Cabinet decision instructions were sent to Sir M. Lampson authorising him to exchange letters with Dr. Wang-agreeing as between themselves on the text of the treaty as negotiated, and reserving it for confirmation by the Chinese Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government. This action was duly taken on the 6th June last.&apos; The letters and the text of the draft treaty will be found in F/3563/34/10 attached.10. The reasons which were considered to make it desirable to take this decision, as set out in the memorandum above referred to, are briefly as follows : Mr. Justice Feetham, in his report to the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressed himself as opposed to the fixing of a time-limit for the surrender of British extra-territorial rights in Shanghai. The objections to a time-limit were indeed obvious, but in spite of these objections, His Majesty&apos;s consul-general and the leading members of the British community at Shanghai shared Sir M. Lampson&apos;s view that Dr. Wang&apos;s offer should be accepted and that the terms of the treaty were more favourable than could have been expected. It was also clear that a period of political chaos lay ahead in China and that if the extra-territoriality negotiations were merely adjourned instead of being brought to a definite conclusion all that Sir M. Lampson had achieved might be lost and British interests always the first to bear the brunt of any attack on the foreign position  might be exposed to grave dangers.     The Cabinet decision to wind up the
negotiations was regarded as placing His Majesty&apos;s Government in a strong tactical position ready to face any situation that might arise. While no progress has been made with the negotiations with other Powers we have in our hands a complete treaty which might be signed if China&apos;s political stability and ability to implement such a treaty permitted it. We have therefore a complete answer to any complaints as regards delay over the abolition of extra-territoriality and it is unlikely that any agitation on the subject will be directed against us. The value of this tactical position is great and we should be very cautious to do nothing to impair it.11. The policy of endeavouring, in accordance with the principles laid down in the December memorandum, to meet China&apos;s legitimate aspirations in the matter of extra-territoriality has been adopted by successive British Governments, not out of any sentimental regard for China&apos;s wishes, but because it was deemed to be the policy best calculated to further British interests in China. As pointed out in the Foreign Office despatch No. 303 of the 7th March, 1931, &quot; the criterion is not whether the Chinese are fit to assume jurisdiction over foreigners, but whether the Chinese are politically sufficiently stabilised to give effect to their determination to put an end to the extra-territorial system.&quot; It is evident,, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government must in this matter pursue an opportunist policy. They cannot map out their course too far ahead. The action to be taken at any given juncture must depend on the political situation in China and the probable degree of stability of the Chinese Central Government.12. The extra-territorial negotiations were conducted on the assumption that there was in China a Government sufficiently stable to implement the treaty, and therefore sufficiently stable effectively to abolish extra-territoriality by unilateral action if no treaty were negotiated. It was on these assumptions that the draft treaty was approved by the Foreign Office, by our representatives in China and by the commercial interests concerned. The position in China to-day is, however, vastly different from what it was at the beginning of the year. The Nanking Government has been disrupted by the secession of its Cantonese members and the establishment of a separate Government at Canton. Banditry is rife over a great part of the country, hordes of soldiers are still maintained by every aspirant to power, and during the summer the greatest flood in history has devastated thousands of square miles and drowned millions of people. Finally, the Japanese, impatient of perpetual misrule and bad faith, have practically seized Manchuria by force of arms. Neither domestic calamities nor foreign aggression have inspired the Chinese to achieve unity or to set up any semblance of effective government. They now admit privately to Sir M. Lampson that there can be no question of enforcing the mandate of the 4th May. Moreover, a strong League commission is to visit China in connexion with the Manchurian dispute, and a totally new position may emerge as a result of the commission^, investigations and recommendations.13. In the circumstances above described there would seem to be no question either of signing the treaty or of resuming the extra-territoriality negotiations, but it is important that His Majesty&apos;s Government should avoid any action or pronouncement that might damage the strong tactical position they have secured by their action in winding up the negotiations in June last. It would certainly stir Chinese nationalism to its depths if His Majesty&apos;s Government gave the impression that they intend to tear up the draft treaty of last June or that they will refuse to proceed to signature when the proper time for doing so may have arrived. In view of the fact that the Chinese are certain to demand substantial modifications in the draft, a waiting policy can be adopted without undue risk. As regards negotiations, Sir M. Lampscn should take no initiative at all, but if approached by the Chinese he should state that, as between China and this country, the whole question must remain in complete abeyance until China is in a position to bring her negotiations with other Powers, up to the point reached by Great Britain, and until she is in a position to implement any treaty that may result from such negotiations. As regards the mandate of the 4th May, it seems unlikely that there will be any determined attempt by the Nanking Government to abolish extra-territoriality by unilateral act on the 1st January. In view, however, of the wild behaviour of the students and the general lack of effective government, it is possible that isolated acts of overzealous local officials at places
*) f\ s)kl t-j tjForeign Office, December 12, 1931.such as, for example, Hankow, may lead to unpleasant incidents. If such incidents are not immediately dealt with, if necessary by a display of force, the results may be serious. Sir M. Lampson might, therefore, be instructed to inform the Chinese Government that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government do not demand the open rescission of the mandate of the 4th May, any local attempts to enforce it will be firmly resisted, and that it is probable that other Govern-ments will adopt the same attitude and join in any measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government may find it necessary to take to maintain the treaty rights of their nationals.

British Empire which are not separate members of thet.comin  /vf  ftTatin-nH *  ----------For the Dominion of Canada :For the Commonwealth of Australia :
For the Dominion of New Zealand :For the Union of South Africa :For the Irish Free State :For India:His Excellency the President of the National Government of the republic of China :Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows : Article 1.1. Except as otherwise provided by the present Treaty, subjects of His Majesty in China shall as from its coming into force be subject to the jurisdiction of the modern Chinese courts of justice (Fa Yuan) and to the duly promulgated laws, ordinances and regulations of China.2. As regards rights of appeal and in all other matters of procedure the modern Chinese codes of law and procedure shall be applicable to subjects of His Majesty. In all legal proceedings and in all matters relating to the administration of justice by the courts subjects of His Majesty shall enjoy treatment not less favourable than that accorded to Chinese citizens.3. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this article, subjects of His Majesty shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the police courts; nor shall they be subject ,to the jurisdiction of any other tribunals than the modern Chinese courts of justice.4. Subjects of His Majesty shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the modern police courts in case of offences under the police offences code or under municipal regulations, but in each of such cases the penalty imposed by the court shall not exceed a fine of 15 yuan (dollars) or, in the event of such fine not being paid, detention at the rate of one day&apos;s detention for each yuan (dollar) of the fine imposed up to a maximum of fifteen days.Article 2.In the district courts in Harbin, Shenyang (Mukden), Tientsin, Tsingtao, Shanghai, Hankow, Chungking, Canton, Foochow, and Kunmin (Yunnanfu), and in the high courts having appellate jurisdiction over such district courts, with the exception of the Supreme Court, special chambers shall be established for dealing with cases involving subjects of His Majesty as defendants or accused. All cases involving subjects of His Majesty, wherever resident, as defendants or accused, except when they may be taken to the Supreme Court on final appeal, or when a subject of His Majesty concerned may elect, in writing, to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the local modern court having jurisdiction over purely Chinese cases of a similar nature, shall be tried only before these special chambers. Any case involving a subject of His Majesty as defendant or accused, which originates within the ordinary jurisdiction of a court other than one of those mentioned above, will (unless the subject of His Majesty concerned elects otherwise, as provided above) be transferred for trial to the special chamber most accessible- to the: court within whose jurisdiction the case originates.Article 3.1. To each of the special chambers provided in the preceding article there shall be attached foreign legal counsellors who shall be selected and appointed as officials of China by the Chinese Govern-ment from among foreign legal experts of high moral character[6325] c
who possess the training, qualifications and practical experience necessary for appointment to judicial offices.2. The names, and the amount and conditions of payment of salaries, of the legal counsellors will be communicated by the&quot; Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Government to His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Representative in China, and their terms of service will be governed by contracts in accordance with the attached declaration by the Chinese Government. They shall remain in office for a specified term, unless dismissed for cause duly shown, and shall otherwise receive the consideration and respect due to the dignity of their office.3. A legal counsellor need not permanently reside at the place in which the special chamber of the court to which he is assigned is established and there shall be a flexible and practicable system of administration of assignments in order to ensure efficiency in the employment of the said legal counsellors.4. The legal counsellors shall serve under the Minister of Justice, and shall be deputed by the Ministry of Justice for serving during the hearing of cases involving subjects of His Majesty as defendants or accused in the special chambers provided in the preceding article. It shall be the duty of the legal counsellors in these cases to observe the workings of the special chambers. They shall have access to the files of the proceedings, and may present their views in writing to the judges, who shall give due consideration to the views thus expressed by the legal counsellors. Adequate arrangements will be made for interpretation in order to enable the legal counsellors to follow and observe the proceedings in court. The legal counsellors shall forward to the Minister of Justice such reports as they may consider necessary, and copies of these reports in cases involving subjects of His Majesty as defendants or accused will immediately be furnished by them to His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Representative in China upon request.5. The legal counsellors shall be authorised to receive directly observations regarding the administration of justice, the execution of judgments, or the manner of the application of the law, and at the request of any of the interested parties shall bring such observations to the notice of the Minister of Justice with a view to ensuring the observance of Chinese law. Copies of such observations in cases involving subjects of His Majesty will likewise immediately be furnished by the legal counsellors to His Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Repre-sentative in China upon request.6. Similarly the legal counsellors shall be authorised to receive any other observations or complaints, including such as may be caused by domiciliary visits, expropriations, requisitions, or arrests, &amp;c, which observations shall be similarly dealt with. Immediately following any domiciliary visits, search, or arrests, directly affecting subjects of His Majesty in any judicial district, the local authorities shall notify the legal counsellor who shall be most accessible in point of time.7. In all cases in which subjects of His Majesty are involved as defendants or accused a foreign legal counsellor shall be present at the hearings of the cases in both the high and district courts and judgment shall be reserved until he has made within three days after the conclusion of the trial such observations in chambers as he may desire to the judges, and, in the event of the judges failing to give them due consideration, the execution of the judgment will be suspended until the observations of the legal counsellor have been considered by the Ministry of Justice, which will take such action as it deems appropriate in the interests of justice.8.
