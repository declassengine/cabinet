Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   9CP. 301 (31).CABINET.THE accompanying memorandum was prepared in the Foreign Office by direction of my predecessor. I circulate it for the information of my colleagues in the Cabinet, and I submit that the considerations it contains deserve the most careful attention.J. S.Foreign Office, November 26, 1931.Changing Conditions in British Foreign Policy, with reference to the Disarmament Conference, a possible Reparations Conference and other contingent Problems.THE Disarmament Conference will meet in February next, unless in the meantime it is overtaken by the march of events calling for the solution of even more urgent problems, which is by no means an unlikely occurrence. In the same month the &quot; Standstill&quot; Agreement comes to an end, and the question of Germany&apos;s solvency reopens, with the prospect of yet another international con-ference to consider the question of reparations, and perhaps war debts; and over all hovers the unsolved problem of the economic reconstruction of Europe, further complicated by the divorce of sterling from gold, and the uncertainty as to Great Britain&apos;s future tariff policy.The events of the last few months have made it increasingly clear that, if any solution of the disarmament question is to be found, it is not along the narrow path of military and naval requirements, but by approaching the subject from the widest possible angle. Whether we like.it or no, we shall, at the Disarmament Conference, inevitably be forced off this narrow path. This is all the more inevitable now that disarmament is going to be studied, if not simultaneously with economic problems, at all events in an atmosphere impregnated with them. Thus circumstances have created a situation where political issues will be inextricably involved with economic and financial questions as well. It is there-fore important to realise from the very outset that the problem which confronts us, viewed in its broadest aspect, is one which merges gradually from the purely military into the political and thence into the economic spheres.The position may be diagnosed as follows : The present world &quot; confidence crisis &quot; can be analysed as a series of inter-locking problems, ranging from the purely financial and monetary problem at the one end to the purely territorial problem created by the Peace Settlements at the other end. The links in the chain fall together more or less in the following order : The monetary crisis leads inevitably back to the economic chaos in Europe. The economic chaos, and all attempts to deal with it, involve in their turn the political questions of reparations and war debts. These are linked by the United States with the question of disarmament, and the latter, in the eyes of the French Government, depends upon the problem of security. The problem of security in its turn raises the question of the territorial status quo in Europe (e.g., the Eastern Frontier question), which brings us to the conflict between the maintenance or revision of the Peace Settlements. We thus have a whole range 6094     [6239] b
of interlocking problems, and, no matter at what link we touch the chain, we cannot find any satisfactory halting place until we have reviewed this whole series of problems.Therefore, unless we are prepared for the conference or conferences to embrace the whole complex of closely interdependent military, political and economic issues, we shall be risking failure from the very start. We ought, moreover, to welcome the broadening of the basis of discussion, as it makes room for the element of bargaining in which lies our best hope of success, since without give and take on all sides it is almost certain that nothing can be achieved. We must be prepared for concession and compromise all round. That being the case, it behoves us to discover not only a means of escape from the present deadlock on the disarmament question, but also a line of policy by which we can solve the far more fundamental political and economic problems from which the whole world is at present suffering. What we must try to do is to assemble and assess all our bargaining counters and utilise them en bloc in order to achieve as substantial an advance towards world recovery as possible. On no account ought we to allow them to be frittered away in return for only subsidiary advantages.Before we can decide on the best means of setting about our task it is necessary to state briefly the present position and to show how one problem hinges on another.Beginning with France, we find that she is unwilling either to disarm or to finance Europe, as she alone can, unless she is satisfied on the question of security. But Germany refuses to accept the territorial settlement of the Peace Treaties, especially as regards the Polish frontier. By security, therefore, France means security not only against aggression and invasion, but security against treaty revision except by negotiation. America refuses to meet France in this matter, and Great Britain also refuses to accept any further commitments; and the absence of American co-operation makes it still more difficult for Great Britain to depart from this attitude. Finally, France refuses to meet Germany on the question of reparations unless America revises war debts. America refuses to relax her drain of gold from Europe until there is an agreement about disarma-ment, and until the more dangerous political issues, such as those of the eastern frontier, have been eliminated. Until this political deadlock is solved, the economic co-operation of Europe, so loudly preached and so difficult to practise, remains a theoretic ideal, and until it becomes a reality, the economic crisis will continue to undermine the social and political structure of Europe.The trouble is immensely aggravated by the universal growth of tariff walls, but in particular of the American tariff. As long as the immense payments which have to be made in Europe cannot be made by exports, but only in gold, there is a constant drain of that metal to New York. The same is true of France, but for other reasons. Not only has this had the effect of pushing London off the gold standard, but the concentration of the major part of the world&apos;s gold supplies in two centres far in excess of their needs for currency and credit is practically equivalent to burying it in the bowels of the earth again. This artificial shortage of gold, added to the natural shortage of supply, is responsible for the present slump in world commodity prices, which, acting first on the countries which produce food-stuffs and raw materials by reducing their purchasing power, has now reacted on the industrial countries. This has resulted in increasing the burden of fixed interest charges, e.g., the debt charges of the raw material countries and the difficulties of meeting reparation payments in Germany. Here again we have a deadlock. Unless a solution can be found for these problems, and that very soon, we may very possibly be faced with a world crisis in which country after country will be plunged into political and economic crises with considerable risk to the whole structure of civilisation.Unless France can be satisfied as regards security and a reasonable measure of disarmament thereby rendered possible, there can be no hope that America&apos;s financial attitude towards Europe would be voluntarily relaxed in the direction that we desire. Assuming that America meets her debtors as regards war debts, then Germany&apos;s creditors can at once afford to be more generous as regards reparations. Germany, satisfied as regards disarmament, reparations and the promise of financial rehabilitation, might be induced to accept as final a settlement of that principal danger spot of Europe, the eastern frontier, on lines which give her something less than complete restitution; while Poland, faced b)r a combination of Great Britain, America, France, Germany and Italy, might
conceivably be brought to a more reasonable frame of mind, though some quid pro quo would have to be found for her, either political or economic or both. Lastly, the desirability of tariff reductions all round, which is a recognised objective of British policy and which has been endorsed in principle by the League of Nations, might at last receive the practical attention of foreign Governments, if they were brought face to face with the alternative of British import tariffs. The reduction of tariffs, however, would be of little advantage in itself, if discriminatory railway rates and other methods of disguised protection were allowed to function in their place. The tariff question, therefore, leads on to further questions of economic co-operation. This has also been recognised by the League.It is obvious that the application of the proposals and methods which are here suggested present difficulties which may prove well-nigh insuperable; but the alternative is the probable failure of the Disarmament Conference or at best a very qualified success, which would leave the prospects of European recovery in a worse plight than before. Failure of the Disarmament Conference would not only shatter all hope of American assistance. It would react on the position and authority of the League of Nations. It would leave France with no possible alternative to her military preponderance and her system of alliances. It would drive Germany to the edge of the abyss of despair. It would render still more difficult any joint effort to put Europe&apos;s economic house in order and to rid her once and for all of the double incubus of war debts and reparations. Therefore, even if the programme seems somewhat visionary and chimerical, it is certainly sound in principle and it is worth serious consideration. Are the weapons in our armoury adequate for achieving this object? What is the attitude of the other Powers concerned likely to be ? Let us examine these points in detail.Great Britain and the British Empire.The aims of British foreign policy are usually defined as the maintenance of peace, support of the League of Nations, and protection and development of British interests abroad.It is possible that, half-consciously as yet, we may be groping our way towards a still farther and wider goal, that is the development of a world economic organism an objective which will to some extent replace our earlier policies, and which will profoundly change the atmosphere in which we at present regard them.If this is in fact our objective, we should be aware of it when we approach the forthcoming conference; and we ought to have a fair idea as to how far we are ourselves prepared to go towards it, at this present time.For our own guidance we must define our policy as clearly as possible. We should next ascertain from the Dominions Governments how far this policy recommends itself to them, and endeavour to obtain their support.There will be two obvious difficulties that of European commitments, and that of the connexion between tariffs and foreign policy. The utilisation of tariff bargaining power is a very different thing from the erection of a British Empire tariff system.It is not within the competence of the Foreign Office to advise as to the relative advantages of the Dominions markets and of other foreign (and especially European) markets for British exports. It is, however, our duty to emphasise the great importance of the British market to foreign countries, and to draw attention to the evident anxiety with which they regard any tariff proposals in Great Britain.We do not suggest that the tariff question should be decided solely from the point of view of our foreign relations, but we do hold that these should be given very careful consideration in connexion with our future tariff policy.If, in order to win the whole of our home market and the whole or the greater part of the Dominions markets, it is necessary to impose a tariff high enough tq keep out all competitive foreign manufactures and to give the Dominions substantial preferences in regard to their food-stuffs, &amp;c, then, in corresponding degree, we reduce the interest of foreign countries in the British import market, [6239] b 2
and thereby the influence which, for economic reasons, we can bring to bear on their policies.This is a matter of vital concern to the Foreign Office.Farther, we must expect retaliation, and we must be prepared to bear the consequences. A high protective tariff, combined with Empire preference, implies a measure of dissociation from Europe, a corresponding diminution of our influence over European affairs, and possibly a growth of economic antagonism.This, too, is a Foreign Office concern.The Foreign Office may also be concerned in explaining to the League of Nations the reasons for any revolutionary change in the fiscal policy of Great Britain. Hitherto, the policy of the League (especially since the Economic Conference of 1927) has been directed towards the reduction of tariff barriers and all abnormal obstructions to trade. British representatives have been prominent in their support of this policy. For instance, we signed, and, until the 30th June, 1932, we are still bound by,- the International Convention of the 8th November, 1927, for the abolition of import and export prohibitions and restrictions; we also signed (but we are not bound by) the Commercial Convention of the 24th March, 1930, designed to prevent any increases of protective duties by any signatory State for a period of at least a year the so-called &apos;&apos; Tariff Truce.&quot;It is recognised that the Dominions will require firm agreements, not provisional ones. They will require such reciprocal arrangements as will be valid, whatever foreign countries may do. In such a case, we should have for the bargaining purposes of our foreign policy only what is left over in our market after our own manufacturers and Dominions producers had been given full satisfaction.This may, or may not, be the right course. One thing is quite clear, that we cannot have it both ways, and that we cannot use the British tariff both to batter down the tariff walls of foreign countries, and at the same time to reinforce a permanent tariff wall around our own Empire.The former alternative is in accordance with the traditional policy of the Foreign Office, and is therefore adopted in the course of the suggestions which follow. The latter can hardly be expected to recommend itself at first sight to the Department whose function it is to promote peaceful relations with foreign countries.The former, on the other hand, will hardly meet the wishes of the Dominions or of those British industrialists whose interests lie in the domestic and Empire markets. They will want to use British tariffs as an end in themselves, while the Dominions Governments will wish us to use them in order to make Great Britain into a closed market for the Dominions.From the point of view of foreign policy, it would, in our opinion, be a mistake to impose forthwith a high and undiscriminating tariff, trampling on long-established foreign interests and leading to retaliation, both economic and political. In negotiation an element of the unknown is of the greatest value; and the knowledge that we have the tariff power, coupled with doubt as to how we are going to use it in the vital question of the opening and shutting of the British market, will, we think, incline the recalcitrant nations of the continent, and even, perhaps, the United States of America, to listen to our views on world recovery.To our foreign policy, therefore, this tariff question is all important. We urge that it should not be decided purely on grounds of domestic or Empire convenience; but that, especially in view of the present crisis, its efficacy as an instrument of foreign policy should be given the fullest consideration. Already our despatches indicate great nervousness on the part of foreign countries, notably France, Belgium, Holland and Italy, as to our tariff intentions; if we can possibly afford to do so, it would be to our advantage to leave them guessing, until we see whether a compromise is practicable over the whole field of foreign politics (including reparations, war debts, disarmament, security, currency, credit, international lending).If possible, however, we should aim at an agreed Empire policy, both as regards tariffs and as regards European recovery. This agreed policy should cover the political, military and economic aspects of the present state of affairs.Our ultimate object in every case is the restoration of confidence, both political and economic.   Our suggestion is that this might best be done by a
series of simultaneous settlements which, in each separate sphere, will create the feeling of security at present lacking. We must create security to obtain disarmament; we must create another kind of security to obtain the free flow of finance; and yet another kind of security so as to be able to break down the tariff walls of Europe. But this security cannot be obtained without effort on our part. It is the object of this memorandum, after examining the weapons in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government and studying the dispositions and objectives of the other protagonists in this drama, to recommend the precise nature of the efforts which His Majesty&apos;s Government might, and should, make to achieve this end.What is the present strength of our position in bargaining with foreign countries with a view to reaching the aims set before us by a correct and comprehensive assessment of our foreign policy?(1) Great Britain is the greatest market in the world for imports; we are the world&apos;s market for metals and produce. All foreign countries have, in the past, assumed that Britain is a free market; this has handicapped us in negotia-tions in the past. But this assumption has now broken down and we have gained that much in bargaining strength.(2) We are still a great creditor nation; and there is solid reason for supposing that the   sterling in still an essential instrument of world trade.(3) We are still a unique financial centre; neither New York nor Paris have the highly-developed technique of the London money market; nor do they inspire within their own borders the confidence with which London is still regarded in Great Britain.(4) Leaving the gold standard has placed a powerful weapon in our hands, and has released us from French and American financial domination; other Dominions and foreign countries already are following the   sterling rather than the gold  , e.g., Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Rhodesia, Crown Colonies, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Finland, Egypt, Argentine, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico. The sterling bloc is almost self-contained. If the Central European countries, whose currencies are at present linked to gold onky by the most painful and unnatural means, leave the gold standard, their obvious halting place will be at the value of sterling. For the time being, there-fore, we should be able to buy our requirements from countries which are now off the gold standard at relatively the same sterling prices as when we were on the gold standard; and the fear of immediately rising prices in Great Britain can, to that extent, be diminished. This applies to almost all the principal raw materials except oil. In the case of oil, too, it is of great importance that the Royal Dutch group has decided to follow sterling prices rather than gold prices.(5) World trade goes on in spite of its difficulties; the sterling bloc offers less difficulties to world trade than does the gold bloc (with its high prices for exports and its high interest charges); vast stocks are still awaiting sale at very low prices.(6) Far Eastern silver now buys more goods in the sterling bloc than in the gold bloc; this improves the prospects for British trade in the China market.(7) Scaling down on all debts must finally come, and Great Britain has begun the process already with sterling debts by a 20 per cent, cut; British foreign investments can consequently be made &quot;safer.&quot;(8) A return to an international monetary standard must one day be made; such stabilisation may have to be in the direction of the devaluated rate, and away from the old gold   rate. If Great Britain can resist inflation and a violent fall in the  , her present position with a relatively high fluctuating   will be very strong in bargaining with the gold countries. &quot; Great BritaiiVs abandonment of the gold standard has given her back the initiative in the world&apos;s financial affairs; for she is no longer harried and helpless with the fear of losing her gold, and all the world is watching attentively to find out what her new policy will be. Moreover, as she stands neither to lose much nor to gain much directly by can-cancellation of war debts and reparations, she is admirably placed for putting forward sane and far-reaching proposals. Given a strong and imaginative Government, concerned above all to get the economic life of the nations once more on a firm basis, Great Britain to-day could lead the world. Instead, she is hovering between her desire to get back to pre-war parity and her fears of losing her position as a creditor country, and letting her great opportunity go by. It will not long remain hers.   For within a few months either some other country
will have wrested the initiative from her, or the world financial system will have dissolved into chaos and maybe revolution. The time to act(&apos;) is now; and the action needed is plain enough for even politicians to see it.&quot; (Bevin and Cole : &quot; The Crisis.-&apos;)To promote the objects of our foreign policy we may now consider that we have four very powerful factors on our side : (1) The fact that our ultimate objective world recovery is shared by ahother countries in the world. (2) The fact that most countries are alive to the importance of the timeelement, i.e., that what is to be done must be done quickly. (3) The importance to all the world of the revaluation of the  . (4) The importance to all the world of any British import tariff.The tariff and the   are our two trump cards in the game of foreign politics.. We have only lately drawn them; and we must consider very carefully when and how they are to be played.We have already discussed at some length the close connexion between our tariff policy and our relations with foreign countries.Our other trump card, which we may be able to use (judiciously) for the same purpose, is the new  .   But the strength of this card depends on the  &apos;s future.The  &apos;s future depends on : -(a) World purchasing power.   This is at present difficult to foretell, sincehalf is on sterling and half on gold. The monopolising of gold stocks, by France and the United States of America has halved all gold prices, and thus has broken all debtor countries who depend on their primary exports to pay their foreign services the gold prices of these exports have fallen in many cases by 50 per cent, in two years. Sterling-offers an advantage to those debtor countries which can now pay their debts at 20 per cent, rebate; but this advantage, however, does not accrue to debtor countries which owe more to gold countries than to sterling ones e.g., Germany who owes more to the United States and to France than to Great Britain, and the South American countries, which owe more to the United States than to Great Britain.(b) The return to the international gold standard (or at any rate to an inter-national monetary rate), but on condition that all debts (including reparations) incurred at high gold prices, are scaled down to meet lower levels; then international lending at lower interest rates (interest rates are at present owing to risk and uncertainty much too high) can healthily begin.(c) The return to large scale world trading.  This depends, in turn, on inter-national stability of prices, new lending to primary countries and lower tariffs. In this case, Britain&apos;s foreign investments, even if voluntarily scaled down to some extent, would revive in value, and the&apos; annual services would be paid again.After this rough diagnosis of the British position, of the aims of our foreign policy and of the means by which they should, in present circumstances, be pursued, we reach the point where we must consider the position of those countries, whose support we should canvass, or resistance we should oppose in pursuing the aims of our policy.Once again it should be repeated that all countries (not excepting the U.S.S.B,.) would accept our final aim of world recovery and prosperity. The fear of one another the same fear which provoked the war has hitherto prevented recovery from the War losses.(&apos;) The authors of this pamphlet are recommending the immediate summoning of a World Economic Conference to deal with .1. Complete cancellation of war debts and reparations.2. Scaling down of the interest obligations of debtor countries.3. The permanent raising and stabilisation of the world level of wholesale prices.4. The reduction of tariffs.5. The regulation of the volume and direction of overseas lending.They, too, have envisaged a chain of causality which links these questions together, but they have fixed their attention on the economic and financial links (i:e., war debts and reparations) rather than the political ones (security and disarmament).
oFrance and Belgium fear German recovery and a war of revenge; they want a Germany prosperous enough to pay reparations in full, but no more than that. France and Italy fear each other both in Europe and in Africa. Three of the States of Central Europe Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Roumania (the &quot;Little Entente&quot;) have made alliance out of fear; and the same fear has linked their fortunes to that sof France. Poland (another of France&apos;s companions in apprehension) is linked to Roumania by a double fear of Germany on one side and of Russia on the other. Russia, the bad child of this unquiet nursery, has added social to national hatred and fear.France.Ever since the rejection of the Anglo-American Treaty of Guarantee, France has sought to insure her security against military aggression, i.e., against an attempt by Germany to overthrow the Versailles Treaty by force, by building up a system of alliances (with Poland &quot;Little Entente &quot;) which givesher unquestionable military predominance in Europe. With the help of these allies she can mobilise over 150 divisions within three months from the outbreak of war against a possible twenty German divisions. Her superiority in all classes of arms and equipment is so overwhelming that any military opposition on the part of Germany could be crushed with ease.The policy of France is summed up in one word, security.In present circumstances the French idea of security involves the insecurity of others. It therefore bears within it the seed of danger; and France, whose militarism is inspired by a genuine desire for peace, would conceivably abandon her policy of armed defence if she could be convinced that she had found a satisfactory alternative. The Polish alliance, for instance, is now more of a liability than an asset to France.French ideas of security used to centre round (a) Defence against aggression.(b) Maintenance of the peace settlement with all restrictive clauses and withreparations payments in full.As regards the former, a large measure of guarantee has been given to her by the Locarno treaties, and the rest of her requirements under this head might be forthcoming through the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris if reinforced by some further instrument.As regards the peace treaties, now that the western frontier of Germany is guaranteed by the Locarno treaties, backed by one of the most complete and elaborate system of fortifications that the world has ever seen, her principal anxieties are : (a) The eastern frontier of Germany.(b) The &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Germany and Austria including a &quot;customs union &quot; between these two countries.(c) Repudiation  by  Germany  of  the   armament  restrictions   and  theassumption of power to alter the treaties by force. id) Growth of the German population.[e) Maintenance of the Trianon settlement, to prevent the penetration of Germany, both political and economic, into the basin of the Danube.The question of the eastern frontier of Germany (which includes that of the Polish corridor, the status of Danzig and the annexed portion of Upper Silesia) is perhaps the most difficult of the political problems created for us by the peace settlement. The advocates of a Polish corridor cutting through a Prussian province, and the advocates of a German corridor barring Poland from the sea, can present on each side a formidable array of arguments racial, historical, military, economic. The real facts are that Poland is now in possession, and that the longer she remains there, so does the corridor become more and more intensively polonised, which renders the problem all the more urgent to Germany; that a Germany fully armed could quickly dispossess Poland; that France could stop Germany&apos;s action no less easily by threatening the Rhine Province; that as Germany&apos;s requirements elsewhere continue to be met, so do her demands tend to concentrate on this question of the eastern frontier; that this question
therefore is the keystone of the security problem, and it is here (more than anywhere else in Europe) that the guarantees implied in the Covenant and proposed by the rejected protocol seem most likely to be required in practice. The political and territorial solution of the question of French security must now be sought on the eastern frontiers of Germany. If France were able to obtain her major requirements elsewhere, it is possible that she would not necessarily support Polish claims if too unreasonable in their nature and if too inconvenient for her own policy; at least, this is what is suggested by remarks made by M. Laval during his recent visit to America.(2)7&apos;he &quot; Anschluss&quot; in the form of a political union between Germany and Austria, seems to us in Great Britain to be reasonable and logical. To the French, it is anathema, even in the form of a customs union. Owing to the inability of Austria to live as an economic unit, if for no other reason, the idea of the German-Austrian Customs Union cannot be regarded as dead, unless and until it is merged in that of a more comprehensive European union.Maintenance of the Trianon Settlement. As the eastern frontier question has linked Poland to France, so has the dismemberment of Hungary linked to her the three &quot; Little Entente &quot; countries, who have benefited thereby, and wbo fear lest, unaided, they may not be able in the long run to maintain this status quo.France has insisted on &quot; security,&quot; not merely in the sense of freedom from invasion, but in that of the preservation of the general treaty settlement. The best indications she has given of what she requires, is perhaps to be found in her oft expressed regret for the Geneva Protocol of 1924, which would provide her with a logical system based on &quot; arbitration, security and disarmament&quot; (coupled with automatic sanctions) thereby insuring her against any alteration by force of the 1919 settlement.In this attitude she has the unflinching support of her allies, Poland,. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Roumania, since any revision of the treaties, might mean the restoration to Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria of territory annexed by them. From their point of view, therefore, failing some general principle of mutual guarantee, French military preponderance is the only alterna-tive to the preponderance of Germany and her allies, which obviously would lead to a forcible revision of the treaties and would completely upset the 1919 settle-ment to their disadvantage.The Franco-Polish Treaty, which dates from 1921, is a defensive military alliance in case of unprovoked attack upon either party; it also provides for&apos; economic solidarity. The Franco-Czechoslovak Treaty (of 1924, upon which the-other French treaties with the Little Entente are modelled) is a treaty of mutual consultation in case of danger to their security or to the peace treaties, with special mention of the &quot; Anschluss&quot; danger and that of the restoration of Habsburg or Hohenzollern dynasties. All these treaties are probably reinforced by secret military conventions.Now that the Locarno Treaties and her fortifications have given to France a fair measure of guarantee to her own frontiers, these alliances have much less value to her, while, on the other hand, they imply considerable commitments.For, from a purely military point of view, France is no longer as supreme in Europe as in the years following the war. Germany, it is true, is still disarmed; but Italy, who is by no means in general agreement with France, is a formidable military and naval Power. Russia is rapidly recovering her military strength; the Five-Year Plan has important military objectives, and is Russia&apos;s answer to the security problem. At present France and her allies all face inwards towards Germany; but already some of them glance nervously over their shoulders at enemies from other quarters. In an advance against Germany, Poland and Roumania are probably already neutralised by Russia; they could not possibly wage war on two fronts. Yugoslavia is neutralised by fear of Italy a fear which would necessarily extend into France itself. There will be an increasing-reluctance on the part of France&apos;s allies to plunge into war.   If the French(-) According to Mr. Stimson, the President and himself had represented to M. Laval that the question of the frontiers of Central Europe was connected with the political unrest in those regions which was at the root of nil political and financial difficulties of the moment. M. Laval replied that the Polish corridor was a monstrosity, but that he had made enquiries at Warsaw, and the Polish Government had said that they would rather have war than agree to any modification of them (see Washington telegram No. 601 of the 26th October, 1931).
hegemony were to drive Germany and Italy into alliance with each other and with Russia, this new combination would out-match that of France and her allies in its potential strength.This nightmare must present itself from time to time to the rulers of France; and it is reasonable to suppose that if it were made plain that the failure of the Disarmament Conference, by provoking Germany to arm, or at least to repudiate her disarmament, would bring the realisation of this danger appreciably nearer, the attitude of the French Government towards treaty revision might conceivably undergo considerable modification. Here is a very weak spot in the French armour; and it is here that no effort should be spared to drive the facts home.Nor are the vast gold reserves of the Bank of France quite so invulnerable a defence of her economic position as might at first appear. We have seen that the suspension of the gold standard may have given certain advantages to Great Britain; in inverse ratio, the maintenance of the gold standard inriicts certain disadvantages on France also on the United States of America and other &quot; gold &apos;&apos; countries. Export industries suffer in the &quot; gold &apos;&apos; countries, and foreign debtors have to find more money to meet their obligations in Paris and New York than in London.Then the French people (and the Americans) mistrust their banks in a degree unknown in Great Britain and tend to hoard both notes and gold. Both &quot;gold&quot; countries have foreign investments which are inherently worse than those of Britain. What action France and the United States may take to redress their disadvantages depends upon their economic situation and their political intentions. M. Laval&apos;s visit to Washington ended neither in a breach nor an embrace.With Germany, France&apos;s political relations are beset with deep-rooted antagonisms, but economic relations are of a very close and complementary nature. Economic Europe consists of an industrial core surrounded by an agricultural envelopment.The industrial core is not the perquisite of any. one nation. It forms a triangle, with its base stretching from Lille to Dortmund, and with its apex at Nancy. Germany, France, Belgium and Luxemburg are the partners in this huge combine of economic power. Only three great nuclei of this kind exist in the world viz., in the United States, in Europe, in the United Kingdom (in order of size and strength). However much the political aims of France and Germany may pull in contrary directions, their joint share in this great estate will keep them together in the domain of the International Steel Cartel. A joint Franco-German economic committee has been set up, as the one practical result of M. Laval&apos;s recent visit to Berlin.M. Briand&apos;s plan for European unity is laid upon this solid foundation of a community of Franco-German interests in the economic sphere. This idea of European union requires careful consideration, and (perhaps) support, in connexion with our own plans for world recovery. Closely connected with it are the French plans for the extension of agricultural credits to the States of East and South-East Europe, which also demands early attention in connexion with the more general problem of international lending. But there is yet another aspect of the economic relations between France and Germany which demands the most careful consideration. At the moment of writing, France seems to aim at a direct settlement with Germany, to be concluded while Germany is in a state of collapse. The settlement would cover reparations, industry and politics, and, if possible, would extract from Germany a &quot;political truce,&quot; whereby she would undertake not to make any effort to modify the peace settlement over a term of years.France will wish to limit discussions to subjects agreeable to herself, and to take them in the order in which she desires to deal with them. She will be opposed to an &quot;all in &quot; conference, and will seek to get her reparations claim ratified before (a) disarmament, and (b) the question of short-term credits (in which she is much less interested than Great Britain or America), reach a crisis next February. However much we may approve the principle of a friendly settlement between Germany and France^ it would not be in our interests to see an agreement on reparations, reached at the sacrifice of our commercial debts to Germany.A direct settlement, in which we have little or no say, is not out of the question. France is very strong; Germany is very weak. France can agree to [6239] , r
take a very large proportion of her reparations payments in kind, since there is a normal demand in France for the steel, coal, &amp;c, in which Germany can pay; she can also offer what Germany most requires, viz., a long-term loan. The price to be paid would be that of Germany&apos;s economic and (to some extent) political independence; and the result of the transaction would be the establishment of French supremacy in Europe. Europe would have achieved a kind of unity; but we doubt very much whether such a unity or, indeed, any unity, except by agreement could last for long or provide the settled conditions necessary for real recovery.For the moment France is, or appears to be, the dominant Power in the world; but her position, as shown above, is not too secure, and she wants to establish it while conditions are favourable. If she could have held a gold threat over Great Britain (as she still can over America), her position would be very strong indeed. As it is, she still holds the key to the situation, and it is essential that we should consider her wishes and try to understand what she means by &quot; security.&quot;The French are also thinking very seriously about&apos; the questions of the stabilisation of the   and the incidence of a British tariff. As regards the  , it -would seem that they are hoping that a satisfactory settlement of the &quot; Standstill &quot; question may be impossible without their co-operation, and that they will be able, in return for this co-operation, to dictate to us regarding the stabilisation of the  . Naturally, they wish to see the   tied to gold once more at an early date, and at a high rate, so as not to prejudice their export trade.As regards the tariff, it is probable that in the course of the Franco-German economic negotiations now proceeding they will try to obtain a financial hold over the German coal industry and supply themselves with coal from Germany instead of from Great Britain. It is even suggested that their plan is to create a coal and steel cartel which will control the whole German output and which would be financed by France. In this way they would become sole masters of the industrial core of Europe, referred to above. The domination of Europe would be effected by a twist of modern strategy, which would make the marchings and counter-marchings of armies look mediaeval and ridiculous.France is neither a weak nor a meek nation. If she thinks that our tariff policy is hurting her or is aimed at bringing pressure to bear upon her, we may be certain that her counter-attack will be swift and sharp, and it is possible that she may be able to mobilise most of economic Europe against us.So much space has been given to France (and so much remains unsaid) because since the war France is the active, whereas Germany is the passive, principle in the European cosmogony.Germany.People in this country seem to be unaware of the extent to which the future of &quot; civilisation &quot; depends on what happens in Germany in the course of the next six months and of the grave doubt as to whether the upshot will be peace or war, recovery or collapse.Economically, Germany is to-day the best equipped of all European countries in every&apos; way in every way, except one, finance. The industrial system (including its well-drilled army of managers, technicians and workmen) could probably supply all the requirements of Europe (and more besides) from this one country alone. But because Germany lost her foreign investment (through the war), wiped out her internal savings (through the inflation), ruined her foreign credit (through reckless talk and-Nationalist agitation among her people), and also partly (but in a much less degree) because of the drain of the reparations payments, Germany to-day has not got the money necessary to activate her great machine. It would have broken down already if it had not been for special arrangements made by her short-term creditors, principally in the United States and Great Britain, to suspend (until the end of February 1932) their claims for money due to them- the &quot; Standstill &quot; agreement. Germany is financially anaemic, and the operation of transfusion (i.e.. supply of foreign credits) was interrupted mid-way.World recovery (the aim of our policy) depends on European recovery; European recovery on German recovery; German recovery on France&apos;s consent: France&apos;s consent on security (for all time) against attack.   The chain is simple to
envisage, but so difficult to link together. German desiderata may be grouped together as follows :- (1) Reparations, complete remission.(2) Disarmament, equality of treatment; so far Germany alone has been disarmed, whereas the Peace Treaties and the Covenant had envisaged this as the first step in a general disarmament.(3) Southern frontier the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria; this question is shelved for the time being, but is bound to recur.(4) Eastern frontier Danzig, Polish Corridor, Upper Silesia (economic question and question of German minorities under Polish rule); at present, whereas public sentiment and military and agrarian require-ments insist on the question of the Corridor, the industrial and financial interests of Germany are more concerned in the return to Germany of the Polish parts of the industrial area of Upper Silesia.(5) Restoration of colonies, perhaps under the mandatory system.(6) Finance.Of these questions (1), (2), (3) and (4) have been discussed elsewhere. It need only be repeated that the problem of the Corridor and of Upper Silesia is one of the most difficult and one of the most urgent; it is impossible to dissociate it from the imminent problems of disarmament and security.(5) Restoration of colonies is dormant at present; it is not necessarily dead.(6) Finance. Finance is Germany&apos;s most urgent necessity. With a scaling down of the reparations payments to the barest minimum required for material reconstruction in France and Belgium and Italy; with a real measure of disarma-ment (by France and her allies); with a settlement of the eastern frontier question, the credit of Germany should stand as high as that of any country and the provision of the loan and credits which she urgently needs should not be a matter of any difficulty. So far as Germany is concerned, therefore, her consent to a general settlement should be forthcoming in return for a promise of financial help, on an international basis. At present, France is likely to offer financial help only on a French basis.United States of America.The policy of the United States is a varying and uncertain factor in the situation. At the present moment, her principal concern is for her domestic difficulties, which are very great and are increasing; an impending presidential election makes decision especially difficult.The United States desires peace and a return to prosperity; she might even make considerable sacrifices of her War Debt claims (chiefly against Great Britain and France), if she were certain that this sacrifice would lead to peace. But she is profoundly mistrustful of the policies and armaments of Europe; and probably only a very real measure of disarmament would convince the United States that the time had come to modify claims which she is fully entitled to press.The United States has refused, and will refuse, to give any kind of guarantee for French security. There is, however, in the United States at present a tendency to regard France as the most stable European country; and there is a close (but perhaps) transitory financial alliance with France in the interests of the gold standard.The Hoover moratorium proposals, however, show that under the pressure of urgent economic necessity there has already been a change in American opinion, and a growing recognition of the connexion between war debts and reparations, and between both and the present world crisis. The high American tariff (which prevents payments in any way but by gold) is also an important factor in the complex; this factor is not so generally recognised, but it is fundamental and decisive.No final settlement of any major international issue can be reached without the approval of the United States of America..So much in consideration of the position of the four principles in that act of the international drama which is just about to open. There are certain other countries of varying importance, the positions of which require mention in this connexion.[6239] c 2
Italy.Next to Germany, Italy is France&apos;s particular concern and anxiety. The Fascist State is restless and ambitious, and dreams too much about the Caesars. Now that Great Britain, United States and Japan have solved their rivalry, the question of naval disarmament is chiefly an issue and an unsolved one between France and Italy; and there are difficulties about North Africa and tolerance of anti-Fascists in France; above all there is fear and dislike of France&apos;s ally Yugo-slavia, who threatens the Italian Adriatic. France is not likely to find support from Italy in any purely French policy. But it must be remembered that Italy is an annexationist State (she is now in process of absorbing Albania), and that the peace settlements gave her the Trentino and Trieste. The cause of European unity, as such, conflicts with her own principle of sacro egoismo.She has added to her economic difficulties by stabilising the lira at too high a valuation. At present she dare not devaluate, as apparently the prestige of the Fascist party is pledged to the gold lira, but if, as the result of an international monetary agreement, a relaxation of the value of the lira were possible without loss of national prestige, this would be a great relief to the country, which is now suffering from an additional 15 per cent, customs duty, imposed as an alternative to further wage cuts.Signor Mussolini, in a recent speech at Naples (the 25th October, 1931), reaffirmed that his policy was in favour of equality of disarmament, and revision of certain clauses of the Peace Treaties. His detailed views on revision are not very clear; the intention of his policy, however, is much clearer, viz., to encourage Germany as a makeweight to France, and Hungary as a makeweight to Yugoslavia.Our geographical and naval position in the Mediterranean, so long as it remains what it is, gives us exceptional influence over Italian policy. Our navy, in fact, is the dominant factor in the control of the Italian seas. Whatever grouping of the Powers may appear to include Italy as a supporter, her attitude will, in the last resort, be determined by our navy; e.g., first, the neutrality of Italy in the Great War; then, her participation on the side of the Allies, despite her previous commitments to the Central Powers in virtue of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria.Belgium.A small country, but, next to Great Britain, the most highly and exclusively industrialised for which reason her tariffs have always been kept fairly low; politically and financially she follows France, but, commercially, she is bound very closely to Great Britain, both as regards exports and imports. Heavy tariffs in Great Britain would have a greater influence on Belgium than any other foreign country. Belgium, having no political ambitions, except security, and very large international economic interests (in which she is closely involved with Germany, e.g., port of Antwerp, share in Western European coal and iron area) is necessarily in favour of settlement, and we may regard her as a helpful factor in the situation, but with a strong tendency to follow the French system as regards security. She is, at the moment, engaged in strengthening her defences on her eastern frontier in the direction of Germany.Scandinavia.The northern countries will approve any practical steps towards disarma-ment (Denmark is the only country in the world which, at the present moment, is considering complete and voluntary disarmament) and towards European recovery. Norway, Sweden and Denmark are so immediately under the influence of the London market that their exchanges have followed the pound; they are all three &quot;off gold.&quot;Poland.Poland desires to maintain the status quo as secured to her by the peace settlement. Her geographical position between two powerful enemies, Germany and Russia, and a lesser one, Lithuania, is very delicate, and it can hardly be wondered at, that she has tried to secure herself by military alliances with
France (against Germany) and with Roumania (against Russia). The Polish question, including as it does, the questions of Danzig, the Corridor, and Upper Silesia, is one of the greatest difficulties in connexion with the general security problem (see under France above). Economic conditions in the industrial region of Upper Silesia are increasingly bad.Central Europe.The States of Central and Southern Europe may be divided into (a) three annexationist States, which are allied to each other (&quot;Little Entente&quot;), and to France for the maintenance of the peace settlements, viz., Czechoslovakia, Yugo-slavia and Roumania; (&amp;) the defeated States which have lost territory and would wish for treaty revision; these are Hungary (the most vociferous), Austria and Bulgaria; (c) Greece, which, although an annexationist State, has no French alliance and is now interested in the Mediterranean rather than in Europe.Hungary was particularly severely treated in the peace settlement and lost territory to all the three countries of the &quot;Little Entente.&quot; Any mention of treaty revision encourages the hopes of Hungary and correspondingly alarms the three allies of France; they are thinking of the Treaty of Trianon, not of the Treaty of Versailles.Austria thinks of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Germany (see above) or of a Danubian Federation, or even a reunion with Hungary as her hope for economic salvation.Roumania has yet another preoccupation. She shares with Poland (with whom she is in alliance) the dangerous neighbourhood of Soviet Russia with this additional danger, that she holds (by permission of all the principal Powers except Japan) a portion of former Russian territory, Bessarabia.The Central European States have all suffered severely from the fall in agricultural prices. A settlement on almost any terms, a revival of trade, a currency adjustment, and a rational distribution of agricultural produce are, to most of them, the only alternative to disintegration either of the slow or violent order. Victors and vanquished alike are in poor shape, economically and financially; Czechoslovakia (being partly industrial) and Greece are the most prosperous; Austria and Hungary are frankly bankrupt.U.S.S.R.The Soviet Union regards the west with the same misgiving and alarm that she herself inspires. Russia will not assist in the recovery of Europe, which she will consider, at first, to be a measure directed against herself. But she has reached a point in her development where a collapse of capitalist Europe would be equally uncongenial to her policies. For the Five-Year Plan depends on credits and supplies from abroad, and the Communist State can only complete its reorganisation in a milieu of well-ordered and prosperous capitalistic communities.The military and economic strength of Russia has increased considerably during the last four or five years, and in a few more years at the present rate of progress she will be as formidable a factor in the world as she was before the war.The recovery of Europe must envisage in its furthest stage a settlement with the U.S.S.R., based on mutual toleration and a profitable exchange of goods and services.Russia, being unable to pay immediately for her urgent requirements, wants a very large loan to complete her industrial and agricultural revolution. The problem of Russia therefore appears to depend upon that of international lending, for which there is as yet neither the disposition nor the machinery.The fall of the pound may make it more profitable for Russia to place orders in Great Britain; in other words, the U.S.S.R. will be drawn for economic reasons towards the sterling bloc rather than the gold bloc.Japan.In European affairs Japan takes an indirect but friendly interest an interest which hitherto has usually agreed with the policy of Great Britain. Recent events in Manchuria may, however, modify Japan&apos;s attitude towards the League of Nations and towards the disarmament question.
Economically, Japan is tied to the gold bloc by the importance of her trade relations with America. This will be a handicap to her export trade with China and India; and it is by no means certain that she will not have to reimpose an embargo on the free export of gold.The foregoing is written on the assumption that the Disarmament Conference in February 1932 is to be the next major event in the development of the European situation.It is by no means certain that this will be so. We have heard, both in this country and abroad, about an impending Currency Conference, and the outline of a Reparations Conference is also rapidly beginning to take shape.But at the latest our troubles will begin on the 2nd February, when the Disarmament Conference opens. As this is the only fixed date set in front of us at present, it is from the subject of disarmament that we have approached the series of problems discussed in this memorandum.It is simply a truism dt is not a prophecy to say that when the first suggestion is made to France that she should proceed to any reduction of armament, she will reply by saying, in effect : &quot; No further reduction of armament without further security.&quot; That has been the burden of every speech made by every French speaker at Geneva during the last eight years. Almost every responsible declaration of policy made in France has amounted to the same thing. Quite recently, and quite gratuitously (in July last) the French Government circulated a memorandum succinctly stating the same policy.Therefore at that period, if not earlier, the question of security will certainly be raised, and it is doubtful whether, even if we wished to, we could turn our back on it. The French position after all is not illogical, and makes its appeal in many quarters. Even so ardent an advocate of revision of the Peace Settle-ment as Senator Borah has recently stated explicitly that France is within her rights in taking such measures as she may deem expedient to ensure her own security. France asks us whether we imagine that any country is likely to maintain armaments in excess of what it considers necessary for its safety. France may be mistaken, but she considers that she needs armaments on her present scale to ensure her against a repetition of the calamities which she, more than other countries, has suffered in the past. She cannot reduce these armaments except in proportion as she can be assured that assistance from outside will certainly and effectively take their place.The great difficulty is to know what, in French opinion, constitutes. &quot; security.&quot; If France were to name a price, there is a danger, perhaps, that the bargain would be clinched, leaving her with a regret that she had not asked for more; so it may be that France has found it convenient not to be too precise on this point. But it is safe to say that France conceives her &quot;security &quot; as-consisting not only in a guarantee against ultimate defeat, but also in the certain knowledge that no future war will ever again be fought on French territory.We have at least two indications of what she desires. One is Marshal Foch&apos;s demand, made in 1919, for control of the Rhine bridges, which was gradually whittled clown to the French proposal that the League of Nations should main-tain a permanent committee of supervision in the demilitarised Rhineland. This proposal was finally abandoned at The Hague Conference in 1929, but its revival would be welcomed by the French as constituting, at any rate, a small part of that physical guarantee on the Rhine, which they have always maintained to be necessary in order to prevent a future war from being fought on the soil of France.A further indication of France&apos;s requirements is to be found in her attitude towards the Geneva Protocol of 1924. France signed that instrument, and declared herself willing, on the strength of it, to come to a Disarmament Conference in 1925.It may be useful, therefore, to examine in some detail the provisions of the protocol in order to get a concrete idea of what France means by &quot; security.&quot; We cannot be sure that her ideas may not have evolved in one direction or the other since 1924 : the protocol is the only guide we have.The fundamental principles of the protocol are (1) Provision for the peaceful settlement of all disputes;(2) Outlawry of the State Avhich refuses to resort to those means of settle-ment or which ignores an award; (3) Organisation of &quot; sanctions &quot; of all kinds against the outlaw.
The protocol was a good deal more rigid than the Covenant in its provisions for the guaranteeing of military assistance against an aggressor, not merely in general terms, but in accordance with a precise plan embodying the actual type and amount of armed assistance to be provided; these were the stipulations which were of special value to France. It was adversely reported on by the naval and military advisers of the British Government. It was rejected by all the Dominions Governments, as going too far in the direction of definite commit-ments.   It was ill received in this country for similar reasons.But since 1925, it will not only be found that the situation has greatly changed owing to the entrance of Germany into the League, Locarno Treaties, &amp;c, but also that the British Government have, by other treaties and engagements, accepted a very considerable amount of the original protocol.The principal features of the protocol are :- (1) That the provisions of the protocol itself should be incorporated in theCovenant of the League; (2) The obligation to submit to compulsory arbitration all international disputes;(3) The obligation, in case of dispute, to refrain from military and other measures, and to comply with the recommendations of the Council, voted by a two-thirds majority, designed to prevent hostilities;(4) The obligation to consider as an aggressor any State which resorted to war without first submitting the dispute to arbitration, or airy State ignoring its obligation under (3) above : a State defaulting in either of these ways was presumed to be an aggressor unless the Council unanimously declared otherwise; if the Council could not at once deter-mine the aggressor, it would be bound to enjoin an armistice on the belligerents, and any belligerent refusing to accept the armistice or violating its terms, to be deemed an aggressor. In this case the Council would act by a two-thirds majority;(5) The obligation of the Council to call on signatory States to apply sanctions both economic and military, against the aggressor forthwith;(6) Various obligations additional to those in article 16, paragraph 3, of the Covenant (financial assistance, preservation of the safety of com-munications on land and sea, &amp;c.);(7) Obligation of the Council to &apos;&apos; prepare plans of action for the applica-tion of the economic and financial sanctions&quot; of article 16 of the Covenant;(8) Obligation to leave to the Council the decision to bring sanctions to an end.Since 1925, the British Government for their part have made the following advances in the direction of the protocol obligations : (1) We have accepted the optional clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and have, therefore, subject to certain reservations, agreed to submit any justiciable dispute to arbitration.(2) We have acceded to the General Act(3) under similar reservations, and have, therefore, accepted the machinery for the peaceful settlement of all kinds of disputes.(3) The Assembly has approved a report indicating the various measures which the Council may take for preventing the outbreak of hostilities during a dispute, and a draft &quot; Treaty for Improving the Means of Preventing War &quot; has now been approved and opened for signature. It is not yet decided whether we can sign the treaty.(4) The Pact of Paris of the 27th August, 1928, binds nearly every country not to resort to war as an instrument of national policy.(*) The General Act was approved by the Assembly of the League on the -26th September, 1928; and certain countries (including France and the British Empire, but not including Germany) have since notified their accession. The Act provides tor a solution of international disputes, both &apos;.&apos; justiciable &quot; and &quot;non-justiciable,&quot; by a system of conciliation and arbitration. It comes into force between any two or more States as soon as they have accepted it in whole or in part, and it remains open indefinitely for the accession of all States. If it were accepted as a whole, it would constitute the machinery necessary to implement article 2 of the Kellogg Pact, which bound the signatories to settle all their disputes by peaceful means without specifying what those means were to be.
A large part of the principles of the protocol have therefore been recognised by us or are likely to be recognised soon; but this by itself does not represent any practical progress in the actual adoption of the protocol as an effective guarantee. What France requires is the adoption of these measures by Germany, whereas, in point of fact, Germany has not accepted the General Act, and, indeed, has expressed her intention not to sign it. To turn these measures into a reality, therefore, requires persuasion of or pressure upon Germany to do her part. It follows that, as regards the protocol, what still remains to be done, is precisely that part of the business to which France, from the point of view of her security, attaches the greatest importance.The chief difference between the protocol and the Covenant still lies in the provisions of the former which create &quot; automatic &quot; tests of aggression, whereas, under the Covenant, it remains within the discretion of each member of the League to judge whether there has been aggression within the meaning of article 16. Further, a declaration of aggression might arise on a decision of the Council taken by a two-thirds majority. Hence the criticism of the protocol, that it tends to create a super-State at Geneva.Moreover, under the protocol, sanctions come into force against the peace-breaker in all circumstances according to a pre-arranged plan, whereas, under the Covenant, the peace may be broken without necessarily incurring sanctions. It is on these two points that the French desire satisfaction if the system of the protocol is to give them security.(1) That sanctions must inevitably work in the cases where they are provided; and(2) That these cases shall cover every possible contingency.The French do not intend to disarm further until they get adequate, assurances on these two points.In this connexion it must be remembered that the protocol was to come into effect only after a reduction of armiaments had been carried out. The sequence of the process was to be (1) Provisions for guarantee of security laid down (i.e., in the protocol). (2) Provisions for reduction of armaments laid down (i.e., by the conference). (3) Reduction of armaments to be carried&apos;out (i.e., by the Governments concerned).(4) Guarantee of security (i.e., protocol) to come into force.If within a certain period the reduction of armaments had not been carried out, a declaration of the Council was to render the protocol null and void.On the verge of a crisis, compared with which our present troubles are but a squall, we may pause to consider whether there is any possible measure which can restore Europe&apos;s confidence in herself and the world&apos;s confidence in Europe. In 1924 we negotiated in fair weather, and there was no reason to apprehend the violence of the oncoming tempest. But circumstances have changed very much for the worse.Only a return of confidence can avert a disaster; and at this moment, so far as one can see, only the pacification of Europe can lead to its return to health.We have already accepted a great deal of what the Geneva Protocol con-tained. While we still have the power to do so, might it not be better for us to bargain our consent to what remains in return for definite and stipulated advantages to our own line of policy, thereby compelling France and her allies to disarmament, since the protocol cannot, on its own showing and on French acceptance, come into effect until armaments have actually been reduced ?What, in practice, would be the additional risks imposed by the protocol upon the British Government? There is no risk whatsoever, so long as there is no imminence or danger of war. What then is the extent of such danger, and where is it likely to arise? The following are the principal danger zones of the world at present :  (1) The German-Polish frontier, owing to the continual irritation caused by the &quot; corridor&quot; and the Upper Silesian question, as noted above (under &quot; France &quot;).
(2) The frontiers of Htmcjary and the relations of this State with the &quot; Little Entente&quot; countries, as resulting from the terms of the Trianon Treaty.(3) The frontiers between Central Europe and the U.S.S.R., i.e., the eastern frontiers of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Roumania. There is here no imminent grievance (except the occupation of Bessarabia), but the Communist Empire is too uneasy a neighbour for the peace of this immense frontier.(4) The Polish-Lithuanian frontier, a minor danger area ever since the Poles seized the city of Vilna.(5) Albania, owing to intense political rivalry between Italy and Yugoslavia.(6) Manchuria, where Japanese ambitions are already in conflict with China, and may eventually be challenged by the Soviet Union.The risk under No. (1) is the most formidable because it is one that might involve our whole power (by order of the League) in the issue of a new Franco-German war arising out of a matter in which we have no direct interest whatsoever, and in which public opinion in this country is likely to be on the side of Germany. Further, as has been pointed out above, the risk of trouble on this eastern frontier of Germany is by no means remote.The risk under No. (6), considered in connexion with recent events in Manchuria, gives rise to the criticism that the protocol machinery is more appropriate to the maintenance of peace in Europe than to the settlement of disputes in regions which are remote from the European area and where it is practically impossible to enforce the decisions of Geneva. It would be unwise, therefore, to adopt the protocol as a world-wide instrument under present conditions. Our immediate aim is European recovery. Any further obligations which we might contemplate should be limited at least to Europe.If, therefore, Great Britain is to assume, under some such instrument as the protocol, a further obligation for French security, then it must be on condition that our risks are minimised, and especialby the risk arising from the eastern frontier question. If it is possible to modify the present frontier in a manner satisfactory to Germany without embittering for ever the animosity of the Poles, then perhaps the greatest obstacle to our acceptance of the protocol obligations is removed.Moreover, there are here the makings of a bargain. In return for benefits on the Vistula, Germany might be asked to agree to some increased control by the League of Nations on the Rhine, on the lines of the proposed Committee of Supervision, mentioned on p. 14 above.But is any peaceful modification of the present status of the eastern frontiers of Germany within the reach of practical politics at the present time % Germany says that it is essential. Great Britain believes that it is advisable. The United States of America (or at least Mr. Hoover) believes that the frontier question is at the root of all our political and financial difficulties. France (or at least M. Laval) admits that the corridor is a monstrosity. But Poland (according to M. Laval) would have war rather than agree to any modification.At any rate, the issues at stake are so vast that it is worth tackling the problem. It is by no means impossible to conceive of a situation so developing in the course of negotiations which would unite such an array of forces as would overcome even Polish obduracy without bloodshed. Europe might come to realise that her salvation was being blocked by Polish pride, and that Polish pride must therefore be sacrificed.The &quot; Economist &quot; of the 14th November, 1931, in a paragraph entitled &quot; An Eastern Locarno,&quot; puts the position in the following terms : &quot; A universal sense of insecurity is the evil which is paralysing the economic and financial life of the world; these paralysing fears are political as well as economic; they are predominantly political in France, whose consequent financial policy is the crux of the present international situation; these French political fears turn partly upon the insecurity of the East European peace settlement, and anything that can be done by other parties to remove these French fears will, therefore, contribute to producing in France that change of mind which it is of vital importance to produce in the general interest of the world. We may therefore have to ask ourselves : is the clanger of being involved in East European commitments really greater [6239] &apos; d
for England than the danger of being involved here and now in the world-wide economic and financial breakdown which the present universal sense of insecurity threatens to bring about? Much would depend on the basis on which an Eastern &apos; Locarno&apos; settlement reposed. For example, could we, perhaps, become a party to an arrangement providing for (i) no alteration of the treaty terms by force; (ii) an effective procedure for implementing article 19 of the League Covenant, which contemplates treaty revision; (iii) an understanding that, when revision comes up for consideration, the obvious economic and social remedies (e.g., effective lowering of customs barriers and effective protection of minorities) should be given a trial before territorial changes are placed on the agenda? It is, at any rate, expedient that British public opinion should begin to think about the eastern frontier question as one of Europe&apos;s burning issues, rather than simply react to a phobia which is one of the psychological contributory causes of the present predicament of the world in general and of Great Britain in particular.&quot;Such is the position with regard to the most serious risk which we would, at this present moment, be called upon to accept, if the obligations of the protocol were in force.The other objections to the instrument arise from the improbability of its acceptance by the Dominions Governments, and by the certainty that the United States would reject it.If we decided to accept the protocol risk, then our first task would be to educate the Dominions Governments to an understanding of our motives, and (if possible) to support of our policy. If we failed in this, then, as in the case of the Locarno Treaty, it might be necessary to go ahead without them. It is very difficult to conceive of one part of the Empire being at war without the others. In the case of Locarno, we were compelled to adopt further commitments than the rest of the Empire, because this settlement involved interests vital to the heart of the Empire. It is doubtful whether we could regard the eastern frontier of Germany in the same lightThe recent definite refusal by the United States to consider any guarantee, even economic, of the security of France, does not encourage us to think that she would for one moment dream of accepting the obligations of the protocol. Here, perhaps, is our second most serious risk. If, under the protocol, the services of the British navy were required to blockade an &apos;&apos; aggressor &quot; State, and if, as is probable, a neutral United States were to be supplying goods .to the &quot;aggressor,&quot; then, as during- the late wrar, American ships would be liable to interference by the British navy, and the question of the freedom of the seas would be raised in its most contentious form.Herein lies one of the risks to which the protocol might expose us. The only way to provide against it is to be sure that the United States, even if she does not sign the protocol, will take parallel action e.g., economic and financial sanctions against the &quot;aggressor.&quot; At one time, it looked as if American sponsorship of the Pact of Paris were going to constitute a real advance towards American responsibility for world peace; and efforts have been made by France to persuade the United States to undertake economic sanctions or to agree to a consultative pact. We should support these efforts and work on the assumption that the United States may still be won over if European disarmament becomes a reality; but, for the present, and without disarmament, the prospects especially since the decisive &quot; No &quot; given to M. Laval on his recent visit to Washington are not very promising.We should, therefore, study what is the minimum of the risk involved by the protocol obligations, which would suffice to give France an acceptable guarantee of security. We should aim, not at a revival of the Geneva Protocol, but at a pact of guarantee embodying its advantages and minimising its risks.Conclusion.If, upon further reflection, we find that the risks entailed by accepting the principles of the protocol in full are less than those which will be upon us, if we allow the present situation to drift, at any rate we can comfort ourselves with
the prospect that the protocol risks, which at present seem so formidable, will be greatly reduced by the measure of disarmament, which acceptance of the protocol necessarily implies. We shall thus have three effective counters with which to bargain : The protocol; stabilisation of the  ; a tariff policy.We must study very carefully how far we can utilise these counters; we must take great care not to fritter them away in separate and subsidiary negotiations; and we must bring them all with us intact to use conjointly for the main object which we have in view, viz., European recovery and the restoration of confidence.Although it is quite impossible to predict with any certainty what will be the views of the different States if definite proposals are communicated to them, yet we may, in quite a general way, infer that the countries from whom we can most confidently expect a sympathetic hearing are as follows :  (1) The British Dominions and India;(2) Those countries who stand to gain by a revision of the peace settlement, viz., the defeated countries : Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria;(3) Those European countries who stand outside the ring, but who are vitally interested in European recovery : Scandinavia, the Baltic countries, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Greece; and(4) For similar reasons, the South and Central American countries.From the following we may expect a variable and intermittent measure of support : United States of America, Japan, Italy, Belgium.It is with France and her allies (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Roumania), who are of necessity most suspicious of peace settlement revision, and to whom disarmament means insecurity, that it will be hardest to strike a bargain.Our objective is world recovery through a return of confidence in Europe. This objective hangs by a chain of problems which has been represented as follows : 1. Monetary crisis.2. Economic chaos.3. Reparations and war debts.4. Disarmament.5. Security.6. Territorial status quo of Europe.7. Revision of the peace settlement.What we have in view is an all-in settlement of these problems. But there is this danger that the delay in reaching an all-in settlement may postpone the achievement of a preliminary measure of disarmament, and that this may precipitate-tate trouble in Germany. On the other hand, it would appear that one cannot touch one link in the chain without pulling up the others along with it; and most of these links are coupled direct to the unsolved security problem.In recent years the chain has been approached from its economic end, in order to reduce economic chaos to some kind of order. These efforts began with the Geneva Economic Conference of 1927. This was followed by M. Briand&apos;s proposal for the federalisation of Europe. Then came Mr. Graham&apos;s scheme for a tariff truce; M. Briand&apos;s proposals for preferential tariffs and international cartels; M. FrancquFs scheme for an international bank for mobilising middle-term credits; M. Benes&apos;s scheme for the unification of economic policy in Central Europe; Mr. Henderson&apos;s committees of economic and financial experts set up in Geneva last summer; and, recently, the Franco-German economic committee. None of these efforts have reached any practical result, because as soon as they progress outside the limit of aspirations they feel the pull of the political questions of reparations and war debts,, and are caught in the tangles of the chain.Similarly, if the problem is tackled from the starting point of disarmament, Ave shall find ourselves at once confronted by the problem of security.There are two roads by which this problem of security can be approached : -(1) It can be left to France and to her allies to entrench themselves in their present position, to maintain the peace settlement intact, and to endeavour by economic and  political pressure to extort further[6239] e
guarantees from Germany. France appears to be pursuing this policy at present, while Germany is in a state of moral and economic collapse, by dangling the bait of financial assistance in return for submission to French economic control of German industry and a renunciation for a number of years of all idea of treaty revision, i.e., the so-called political truce.It is our belief that, this policy will not solve the problem of European recovery and the return of confidence. On the contrary, even if it is successful for the moment in establishing the French claims as paramount, it will result in the continuance and exasperation of the friction, which has contributed so much already to the insecurity of Europe.(2) The alternative road is that of international agreement and action, by which Europe, as a whole, and Great Britain, in particular, will undertake to make further contributions in order to create confidence and to re-establish security. This is the road recommended in our estimate of the present position. We do not minimise the risks of involving Great Britain yet further in the fate of a Europe, torn by dissension and undermined by financial decay; but we believe that we are already committed by our geographical position and by the extent of our economic relations.If this is our belief, then we are faced by two questions : (1) How far can Great Britain bring pressure to bear on recalcitrant Powers in order to induce them to contribute to a policy of international pacification and reconstruction ?(2) How far can Great Britain herself go in making her own contribution towards this end ?As regards (1), we have two weapons, the stabilisation of the   and the tariff. The question of their respective efficacy has already been discussed above. The present threat to change our tariff policy can, if used wisely, serve as a battering-ram to break down tariff walls and thereby force other countries to make definite economic contributions towards the re-establishment of confidence. If used unwisely, it may provoke a form of economic war, the result of which is difficult to foresee.It has already&apos;- been pointed out towards the beginning of this memorandum that the policy of a high tariff with Empire preference cannot be reconciled with the use of British tariffs as a bargaining counter in order to force other countries to reduce their tariff walls. If the former policy is adopted, it will tend to lessen the economic influence of Great Britain over foreign countries. From a Foreign Office point of view, therefore, the latter policy is the more advantageous and the less dangerous.As regards question (2) the direct contribution of Great Britain towards the re-establishment of confidence the obvious form for this to take would be an acceptance of a further degree of responsibility for peace such as is embodied in the Geneva Protocol of 1924, the terms and the risks of which have been fully examined above.Our aim should be an &quot; all-in&quot; settlement; and it is for an &quot; all-in&quot; settle-ment that we must prepare during the short time that we may still have for preparation.Confidence, which is the only way to recovery, cannot be restored by piece-meal settlements; nor is it likely that one link in the chain, e.g., disarmament, can be detached for separate examination. It will necessarily pull the others along with it. If, when the period of conference or conferences begins, we fail to get the &quot; all-in&quot; settlement, then we must try to get as much of it as we can, hoping that European recovery will follow in corresponding ratio.Our minimum programme can hardly include less than the scaling down of the War Debts and a satisfactory settlement of German (and Bulgarian and Hungarian) payments, both private and governmental. Further, since it is unlikely that a financial settlement is practicable over any length of time without a political settlement of those outstanding questions which have led to the
collapse of confidence in Europe, we must add to our minimum programme the fullest possible measure of satisfaction under the three following heads :  1. Disarmament.2. Guarantee of Security.3. Rectification of frontiers.Our maximum, programme, however, should regard the solution of these questions as an essential, but preliminary, stage in a much wider development of world recovery. On this basis, our aim should be to try to solve the crisis by three consecutive processes : (1) To remove the economic and political obstacles to recovery, i.e., the minimum programme outlined above an advance which should cul-terminate in agreement upon a stable international currency;(2) To sow the seed of recovery on the ground which has thus been cleared, by the introduction oi an international credit system and the rationalisation of tariffs, and of other existing impediments to trade;(3) To reap the harvest of disarmament and security in a world where pro-duction and distribution will be rationally regulated under a system of international quotas.We should at any rate explore the potentialities of such a solution in detail and without delay, and see whether we can adapt the foreign policy of the British Empire to suit its requirements.The minimum programme aims at the removal of obstacles to world recovery; the maximum programme follows up this curative process with the indication of a constructive policy based on the idea of some form of international rationalising of production. All countries are aiming to-day at a high standard of industrialisation combined with high technical efficiency. The problem of pro-duction is solved; but this brings with it a problem of distribution which can only be solved by cut-throat competition, or by international agreement in the economic sphere. Such an agreement must be founded on some kind of quota sj^stem, and the quotas have to be rationed according to the requirements of each market and the size and range of the producing unit, whether national or otherwise. Private interests are already thinking along lines such as these. The tendency of big business, financial, productive and distributive, is towards international agree-ments and amalgamations. In this sense the whole world is drawing closer together. We must beware lest our political thought lag behind economic realities; it is this which is causing the failure of all Governments the whole world over. Whereas economics tend more and more towards internationalism, politics, by a retrograde movement, have been tending since the war towards an intensive nationalism. As long as politics and economics are thus tugging in opposite directions, it is difficult to foresee how any real stability and permanence can be reached in Europe. A nation which aspires to take the lead in present circumstances, must be fully alive to both these tendencies of the times.It is too early as yet to formulate a concrete policy on so general a forecast. It may, indeed, be objected that this indication is outside the scope of the present memorandum. But it is as well to study the chart even beyond the point to which we have laid the first line of our course. A current of world tendencies is carrying us onward, further perhaps than we are at present aware.At this critical moment in our history, it is clear that British foreign policy must be formulated on a very broad basis. This is the first object of the fore-going memorandum, and this must be accepted as axiomatic. An attempt has been made to define this basis and to evolve a general line. It is fully realised that there are many and serious objections to some of the suggestions contained herein, but they have been formulated after long consideration of the difficulties with which Ave are faced. If we cannot advance on lines such as these, is there an alternative policy ? If there is no alternative, what is in store for Europe ? And what is in store for the world ?
