Its DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. )c R 3.1.copy no.     ^7cab I N E Tland valuation and land value tax,.Memorandum b.y the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. Since the National Government assumed office,   Ihave naturally had under leview the present position of the scheme proposed by the late Labour Government for a valuation of land and the imposition of a land value tax which is now contained in the Finance Act, 1931.2. It will be recalled that under that scheme the valuation of the land is to be made as at 1st January, 1932, for which purpose it has,  of course, been necesse.ry for the Inland Revenue to undertake a great deal of preparatory work and engage additional staff.      It was originally estimated that the valuation would be substantially completed in the early part of 1934 (i.e.  in some 2-?- years)  and that the cost of this work would amount to  ml to  ml-g-.    The tax itself, which is fixed at the rate of Id.   in the   of capital land value as determined on the lines laid down in the Act,  is imposed, not for the current or following year, but for the financial year 1933-34 and each subsequent year.    It will in the absence of further legislation automatically come into force for that year (1933-34)  and will be payable in July, 1934 3. After the formation of the first National Governmentthe programme of the work of valuation was modified under the instructions of my predecessor, with a view to the siowing-down of the work and the reduction of the anticipated expendi-ture upon it in the earlier years, and under the present programme I am informed that the task will not be completed until September, 1934.4. Up to the present the actual cost of the valuationTlW
work is about 5120,000 and the nuuber of staff engaged by the Inland Revenue in this connection is 713 0    On&apos;&apos; 12th November i gave instructions that no i. ore staff was to be engaged pending the final decision by the Cabinet on the future of the land value legislation-5. With regard to the land value tax, it will berer-enbered that the operation of the tax, as it was originally introduced in the finance Bill, was very considerably restricted in consequence of amendments which were passed by the House of Commons.    The effect of these ansndr.ents is that the tax, instead of being charged on the full land value, as originally proposed, is now chargeable upon a-greats reduced figure, namely - (i) one-eighth of the land value; or  (ii) the land value less four tines the annual value (for Schedule A) of the land and buildings, whichever amount is the greater.    In addition, there was a considerable extension of the classes of property which were to be exempt from the tax*5. Ho estimate of the probable yield of the tax has ever been made public, but I am advised that the result of the amendments referred to is to reduce the yield which was originally anticipated from it, possibly by at least two-thirds, and, in addition, to render the administration of the tax much more difficult and costly.It is clear that the tax,  as it stands upon the statute hook to-day, will be comparatively unproductive and that without amending legislation it could never be an efficient, workable and revenue-oprodueing duty.    It is certain, however, that the present Hoti.se of Commons would not be disposed to restore it to Its original form or even to let it come into operation as&apos;it is.7, There remains the question of the valuation itself
Before making up my mind as to the course tobe recommended to the Cabinet, I investigated the subject of an Increment Value Duty as being the only kind of duty on land which could conceivably command a fairly general assent if proposed by a National Government.      The subject has been impartially investigated by the Inland Revenue who have prepared a report, which I shall be happy to show to any of my colleagues who may desire to see it.       In effect, the report, while admitting that the principle of an increment duty (in cases where the improved value of land is not due to the owner&apos;s efforts)    is in theory unanswerable, shows that the practical difficulties of administering such a tax are, if not insuperable,  so great as to nullify its advantages. &quot;For a long time from its inception any yield&quot; (it is stated) &quot;that the tax would produce would be quite incommensurate with the cost of valuation (i.e. the valuation on the lines prescribed by the Finance Act, 1931) and collection&quot;.8,.      In these circumstances it seems to me impossible to defend the continuance of the expense of a valuation which has ceased to present any prospect of serving a useful purpose. The situation has changed owing to our departure from the gold standard for without that anchor it is possible that the price of land together with other commodities might undergo great fluctuations from one valuation date to another.      This will no doubt be present to the minds of the public..      The new income tax demands which will be made in January for f of the tax for the year are already causing apjciety and there are signs of a troublesome agitation in the Press.      If at the very moment when so many householders are having difficulty to find the money for the tax gatherer it is represented to them that this money is being used to pay an army of 700 officials to do work which admittedly1,will never produce any result it isnot difficult to see the discredit in which the Government will-5-
1 i fti. l, be involved.9.    It would be unfair to some of my colleagues not to recognise that the decision which i feel bound to urge the Cabinet tc take puts them in a difficult position.      I earnestly desire to  do anything i can to present the case to the public in a way which would be as little unpalatable as may b3.      If the Cabinet agrees with my recommendations i would ask that the valuation claused in the Finance Act should not be repealed but suspended.,    This could probably be effected by a single amendment to the interpretation clause    providing that the valuation date shall be &quot;such dater------ -as Parliament may hereafter prescribe&quot; instead of the specific date now named in the Act-.      The clauses dealing with the machinery of valuation would thus remain on the Statute Book.10.    7/it&apos;n regard to the staff, they would be dispersed gre.dually*      Some of them might be transferred to other departments.      But as they are all on a temporary basis no difficulty would arise.      The saving to be effected would amount to about  50,000 in the current year and say  250,000 to  350,-000 in each of the three following years.(Initialled)   ff.G.T reasury Oh amb ers, S * w&quot;1.
