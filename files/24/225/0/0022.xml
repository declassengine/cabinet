&amp; o* OInterim Report Appreciation of Elements in Political Problem Involved.1. THE Cabinet Committee on Preparations for the Disarmament Conference has held three meetings and has had before it, amongst other material, the Nine Resolutions of the Three Party Committee in July last, together with the detailed examination and supplementary analysis of these Resolutions contained in the Report last November of the Interdepartmental Committee presided over by Mr. Cadogan (C.D.C (31) 10). In addition, each of the Three Services has provided a full statement of its general attitude to proposals for further British reduction. Broadly speaking, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry all take up the position that, in view of the very substantial reductions which we have made in recent years as an example for other nations, and in view of the failure of other nations to follow our lead,* it will really be impossible, having regard to our own situation and commitments, for the British Cabinet to contemplate further disarmament on our part. There may be certain exceptions to this general statement (e.g., the Admiralty would be prepared to contemplate the reduction, by international agreement, of the size of capital ships and of the guns they carry), and it has to be remembered that, at the forth-coming Conference, other nations will not accept the view that they have failed to reduce their armed strength France, for example, contends that by reducing-her period of compulsory service she has greatly weakened her fighting efficiency.2. These technical questions would occupy a great deal of time to discuss and on many points of detail the British Delegation to the Disarmament Conference will, we apprehend, have to be left with a good deal of discretion, and, in case of need, will refer some matters as they emerge back for Cabinet confirmation. But we are deeply impressed with the feeling that there lies behind all this mass of technical detail a general question as to the policy and attitude to be taken up at the Conference by the British Government. The answer to this general question depends on a just appreciation of the big issues involved and of the main contentions of other Powers, especially of Germany and France. There has been no Cabinet decision on these fundamental issues of policy and we therefore think that we should place before the Cabinet at once an appreciation of the position which is likely to arise and invite some decision upon it since these technical controversies can only be handled after the broad lines of British policy at the Conference are laid down for the guidance of the British Delegation.Germany&apos;s Case.3. Germany&apos;s case at the Disarmament Conference may be expected to be presented on the following lines : Under Part V of the Treaty of Versailles her armaments are expressly restricted. The German army must not exceed 100,000 men; there must be no conscription; Germany is to have no land guns of more* The contrast between the reduction in British miiiiiiry expenditure and the increase of foreign military expenditure is very striking. &quot;Comparing 1924-25&quot; with 1931-32, Great Britain has reduced her military expenditure from  45^ million to under  40 million. Between the same dates France has increased from 4V70O million to (i,847 million francs (this does not include votes for fortifications); Italy, from 2,247 million lire to &apos;3,267 million lire; the United States, from 203 million dollars to 339 million dollars; Russia, from 417 million roubles to 1,390 million roubles (the Russian figure includes naval and air force expenditure): and Germany, from 346 million marks to 472 million marks. This last figure, however, is a substantial reduction from over 530 million marks four years ago. The only great Power, apart from ourselves, whose military expenditure has not g-one up in the six years&apos; period is Japan  204 million yen in 1924-25, which, after rising- to nearly 230 million yen in 1928, stands this year at 200&quot; million yen.6116    [6310] b
than 6-inch calibre and only a limited number of these; she must have no tanks or armoured cars, no naval or military air force of any sort, no submarines, and the number and tonnage of her naval vessels are also severely limited. Germany&apos;s primary contention will be that this inferiority of status ought to come to an end, and this is the significance of the phrase &quot;equality of treatment&quot;&apos; as a principle of disarmament. Manifestly, equality of status might either be secured by applying to other nations, as well as to Germany, the prohibition of certain types of weapons and numerical limitations, or it might come about by releasing Germany from the limitations of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. But Germany&apos;s case for equality of treatment does not depend merely on an abstract contention that equality is equity. She points out that Part V of the Treaty of Versailles begins with the words &quot;In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations,&quot; and conse-quently Germany argues either that she has a legal right, under the Treaty, to insist upon corresponding reductions in armaments by others or, at any rate, that she is discharged from the obligations of Part V in view of the failure of others to disarm. The validity of these contentions as a matter of law was investigated some time ago by the legal advisers of the Foreign Office and has been further considered at our request. We append a Memorandum by Mr. Beckett, with which we concur.But, even if, under the actual terms of the Treaty, the legal contention fails, Germany makes a moral claim to the same effect which will have a wide measure of sympathy in this country and in some, at any rate, of the Dominions. She places reliance on the well-known declaration made by Clemenceau on behalf of the Allied and Associated Powers just before the Treaty was signed, to the effect that Germany was required to reduce her armaments, not solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression, but as the first step towards that general reduction and limitation of armaments which it would be one of the first duties of the League of Nations to promote. Moreover, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations in 1926 and, according to her, article 164 of the Treaty of Versailles now gives her a right to claim revision. As a further support to her argument, Germany refers to the final Protocol of the Locarno Conference (the 16th October, 1925) in which she joined with the other Governments in declaring that the Locarno Treaty would hasten on effectively the disarmament provided for in article 8 of the Covenant.Germany has a further point to make which emphasises her complaint about inequality of treatment. By the terms of the Covenant of the League, every other country&apos;s need for armaments is measured by having regard to the force necessary to provide for her own security. Germany, on the other hand, though now a member of the League of Nations, has her extent of armaments determined by a fixed and arbitrary limit; germany&apos;s armaments under the Treaty are stabilised while the amount of armaments in other countries may fluctuate. It is true that the naval agreements of Washington and London have fixed certain limits in naval armaments for the Powers bound by them, but this was a result of negotiation and reciprocal concession, whereas Germany&apos;s fixed maximum was imposed upon her. One of the merits of the Draft Disarmament Convention prepared at Geneva is that it seeks to frame the same general method of limi-tation for all Powers alike. But article 53 of the Draft recognises and reaffirms existing obligations, which must include Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, so it is not surprising that Germany has given notice that she could not accept it.Germany&apos;s case, therefore, will be that she cannot be left indefinitely under these severe limitations when she is ringed round by other Powers who are in command of overwhelming forces. This case, as we have shown above, can be supported by very persuasive contentions, and it is obvious that the existence of this sense of grievance in Germany and the reactions to which it gives rise threaten the gravest disturbance to European peace. It is manifestly of funda-mental importance to decide what is the attitude which should be taken up by the British Delegation in regard to Germany&apos;s contentions.France&apos;s Case.4. Now take the case which France will make at the Disarmament Conference.   We know what it is with great precision, for it is contained in the
elaborate French Memorandum of 17th July last.   It begins by insisting that article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations embodies two main ideas.  Thefirst is the idea of common action to enforce international obligations, from whichthe conclusion is deduced that unless adequate provision has been made for Lprompt and certain common action, each State must have sufficient armaments tosecure its own protection against aggression.     The second essential idea ofarticle 8 is the principle that the extent to which national armaments can bereduced depends upon the degree of security enjoyed by the nation concerned,&quot;the geographical situation and circumstances of each nation differ, and therecannot, therefore, be any automatic equalisation of forces.   Equality of arma-ments as between two States would, according to the French thesis, only be justifiable in the unlikely event of their geographical situation and circumstancesbeing indistinguishable.   The French memorandum then goes on to say that, inthe midst of this diversity, one fixed element is provided by Part V of the peace treaties.   The French memorandum seeks to treat this as the final limitation forthe Central Powers;  it quotes the introductory words  of  Part V, but itvigorously repudiates any idea that the standards imposed upon Germany arestandards which other Powers must themselves adopt, arguing that if the standards prescribed in Part V were to apply in an equal and uniform manner toall other States, article 8 of the League Covenant would lose all significance.The French memorandum then goes on to claim that France has, of her own accord, reduced her- armaments, notwithstanding the particular circumstances of French national defence and the needs of France&apos;s overseas Empire. The memorandum notes the failure to provide the Anglo-American guarantee on Avhich the framers of the Peace Treaty relied, but acknowledges that the Locarno Agreement made a great additional contribution to the guarantees of security. The contention that France has, in fact, reduced her armaments appears largely to depend on the cutting down of the period of compulsory military service from three years in turn to two years, eighteen months and twelve months, and France maintains that this involves so large a decline in military efficiency that it has been necessary to undertake at great expense the construction of fortification works on the frontier. As regards naval forces, the memorandum expresses regret that France could not be included under Part III of the London Treaty, and hopes that both France and Italy can join in arrangements at the forthcoming conference. The global figure of total French tonnage on the 1st January, 1930, is given as 628,603 tons, of Avhich 97,875 are submarines (note how this last figure contrasts with the submarine maximum of 52,700 tons agreed to by the United States, British Commonwealth and Japan in the London Treaty). As regards air forces, the French memorandum asserts that the programme laid before the French Parliament in 1925 providing for i2,247 machines for the.whole forces and 180 naval machines is already insufficient . K^rr-v-a-to meet the requirements of air defence, for this programme &quot; could not allow for the development of non-military aeronautics, which can be subjected to no limitation whatever and which constitute nonetheless one of the most important elements of the problem of air security.&quot; The memorandum claims that nonetheless the execution of their air programme has only been carried out to a small extent, e.g., the number of machines in service in the tactical units of home defence is given as 1,210.* The memorandum contends that the steps which France has already voluntarily taken have reduced her armaments &quot;to a level that appears to her strictly to represent the lowest point consistent with her national security in the present state of Europe and the world.&quot;The third and last part of the French memorandum is devoted to emphasising the necessity of confidence and security as the only means of bringing about reduction of armaments. It repeats that if the restrictions imposed by Part V of the Peace Treaties were removed, it wrould be impossible for other States to be restricted to the levels at present prevailing. A practical solution is only possible if the entire international situation is altered. The extension of arbitration is good as far as it goes, but it cannot alone suffice to ensure peace, for some penalty is needed for violation of pledges. The French Government, therefore, pronounces for &quot; the necessity of a security guaranteed to every State by assistance which would be mutual, effective and prompt.&quot;   The essential* This is exclusive of X*b machines in French/Africa.   Byway of contrast, the British figure for militii&quot;j nii-&quot;nfr v\ iSTi1&quot;1, &quot;-:t&apos;i &apos;H n t- in Tirlin  
question for the Disarmament Conference, the French Government considers, is this War having been outlawed (e.g., by the Kellogg Pact), what will States do if war breaks out and a crime of aggression is committed? Consequently, France, while claiming to have reduced armaments as far as possible, is prepared to collaborate in any system for the general organisation of peace which, by means of definite pledges of effective mutual assistance in case of aggression, would enable each State, as soon as the nature and promptness of this assistance has been specified, to determine the further reductions thus rendered possible. Summing up, therefore, France&apos;s case is : (a) She has lost the security which was intended to be given her at the timeof the Treaty of Versailles by the Anglo-American guarantee of the Franco-German frontier. She will say that if she had known that this guarantee would not have been forthcoming, she would have insisted on the Rhine frontier.(b) The limitation of German armaments under Part V of the Treaty is,according to her, a datum line by reference to which French arma-ments are determined. If the limitations of Part V are removed, France&apos;s present armaments would be insufficient. In contrast with the German thesis of &quot;equality of treatment,&quot; France&apos;s whole case rests on the assumption that Germany remains bound by Part V.(c) Even on this assumption, France contends that she cannot disarmfurther, save in return for a corresponding addition to her &quot; security.&quot;A attitude of other European Powers.5. Down to this point, we have not mentioned the Eastern frontier of Germany, and this, of course, vastly complicates the political problem. Germany&apos;s insistence that she must be freed from the limitations of Part V of the Treaty is intensified by her unwillingness to regard the line of her Eastern frontier as final. (She has, however, given an undertaking, in connection with Locarno, that she will not seek to alter this frontier by force.) This Eastern frontier problem also materially influences the attitude of France at the Disarma-ment Conference, because the secret Franco-Polish Alliance requires France to come to the aid of Poland if Germany attempts to break out on that side. It is this, of course, which lends special significance to France&apos;s insistence on security as the condition of her further disarmament. Poland has shown no sign of being willing to give support to Disarmament and is the less likely to do so in view of the constant indications of German resentment. There is reason to believe that Poland is negotiating a pact of non-aggression with Russia, but, even if this comes off, it seems unlikely that Poland would show a disposition to reduce arma-ments. Indeed, she is specially insistent that she needs submarines to protect herself against enemy cruisers in the Baltic.It is to be observed that the part of the Treaty of Versailles which Germany is actively concerned in getting altered now is Part V and not the section of Part III which drew her Eastern boundary. The fear of France, Poland and the Little Entente naturally is that, if Germany got free to re-arm, the next step would be to claim to rectify the Eastern frontier.It is convenient to indicate what is likely to be the ranging of Powers at the Disarmament Conference in regard to the French and German contentions respectively. The following Powers will, in all probability, endorse the French point of view.: Belgium, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Roumania.The attitude of Italy is likely to be critical of the French attitude, but Signor Grandi has recently stated to our Ambassador in Rome that Italy cannot do much more than afford &quot;spiritual&quot; help. . The attitude of Italy will be much influenced by our own&apos;.    Jc-c-it&apos;vH*^       J U-Aa , 1-WlUvJ t ^-Ij^-v&apos;-.        rl^vwi Sv^.-As regards America, the tendency seems to be increasingly to support France. Even Senator Borah has recently declared that France is entitled to take measures for her own security. And there is reason to believe that M. Lavafs visit to Washington has had the result of limiting any intentions of Mr. Hoover to use his influence in an opposite direction.Germany cannot expect much help from her ex-allies. Austria is out of the picture, while France has just concluded a loan agreement with Hungary which has brought into being at BudajDest a ministry sympathetic to France.
Germany will find a supporter in Russia. Indeed. Russia objects to the draft Disarmament Convention because it does not set out to secure the complete abolition of armaments, which suggests that, unlike charity, disarmament does not begin at home.We are specially concerned to consider the Dominion point of view and we must always remember the significance and consequence of a sharply independent attitude taken up by different members of the British Commonwealth. South Africa and the Irish Free State Avill support the German thesis South Africa has already communicated with the Dominions Office to indicate that this is her general view. The Canadian Government has replied that it does not think it well to make any observations on the Resolutions of the Three Party Committee. New Zealand may be expected to be ready to align itself with the British view. In the case of Australia something depends on the Government in power.6. A great deal might be added by way of supplementary considerations, but the above sketch indicates sufficiently the central political issue which is bound to dominate the Disarmament Conference, unless indeed it is deliberately shelved and a discussion of rival contentions in the technical field is to occupy a great deal of time without much probability of result. We recognise that it would be very important to secure, if it were possible, e.g., the abolition or reduction in size of certain weapons of war, or the abolition of submarines (which France, Japan and Poland, together with a host of smaller States, would oppose). But it seems to us that even the discussion of these useful and desirable topics must be governed by our conceptions of the general attitude of Britain to the broad contentions which we have set out.7. We, therefore, ask ourselves, and we think the Cabinet as a whole should con si der (1) In the main controversy which is bound to arise between the German and French positions, what is to be the British attitude? Probably, this question cannot be categorically answered, but nonetheless the opening debate may easily develop on lines in which Britain cannot remain entirely silent on the point. It may be that, in answer to the German challenge on the principle of equality of treatment, we ought to say that adjustments must take place by degrees. Or, again, a conceivable line is that we are parties, like Germany and France, to the Treaty of Versailles, and the Pact of Locarno, and that modifications in the present position, so far as Germany&apos;s claims are concerned, ought to be arrnred at under the Treaty and not in defiance of it. But whatever our attitude is going to be, it is essential that it should be thought out and determined upon in advance of the issue actually arising.(2) What is the British answer to the French claim for &apos;&apos; security &apos;&apos; ? Are we prepared to pay the price which may be the only means of bringing about a reduction in French armaments ? That price is some form of guarantee, over and above Locarno, under which, in conceivable circumstances, British forces might be engaged in war on the Continent of Europe, even in respect of the Eastern frontier of Germany.(3) Alternatively, is the idea worth pursuing of a Mediterranean Locarno ? By this, we understand to be meant a mutual guarantee between the Powers chiefly interested in that area France, Italy, Britain, Yugo-sbavia, Spain, Turkey, Greece, &amp;c. under which, in the event of aggression against any one by any other of them, the others undertake to come to her aid against the aggressor. One application of such a pact, which is of special value to France, would be her security in transporting troops from North Africa in the event of an attack on her. If France were assured that her troopships across the Mediter-ranean would not be interfered with, she might, on this ground, be persuaded to reduce the sum total of her forces. England&apos;s special position in the Mediterranean would enable her to exert much influence in settling the terms of a Mediterranean Pact, and might help to prevent the creation of submarine fleets by the smaller States with a Mediterranean seaboard.   We ought to add that, at the time[6310] c
of the London Naval Conference, the French idea of a Mediterranean Locarno was rejected by the British Government after discussion with Commonwealth delegates. The idea was never worked out as a plan, but the French were told in clear terms that public opinion here would not be prepared to accept it. (4) A further alternative proposal, of an even more shadowy kind, is the creation of some international force. France has thrown out hints that she might favour the creation of an international air force. We do not know enough about the plan to comment on it, but we are bound to mention it, as it is said that France may, at the Conference, propound some such plan and leave others to discuss it.8. We fully appreciate that in this interim report we have asked questions instead of answering them. But the first thing, we think, is to face the questions themselves and, as time is so short, we think it is our duty to bring this statement of the underlying problem before our colleagues before we separate. We will do our best, in the Cabinet discussion, to state how far we feel able to contribute towards an answer. But, difficult as the answer must be, we hope that something is gained by extracting and exposing what we believe to be the heart of the matter.J. S.(On behalf of the Committee.)December 12, 1931.
D.C. (P.) 22.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.(Three Party Committee.)Allied Obligations in the Matter of Disarmament.IN accordance with the request made at the Third Meeting of the Sub-Committee on the Disarmament Conference, on the 7th May, I circulate herewith a memorandum on the Allied obligations in the matter of disarmament.This memorandum was written in 1926, but does not require any substantial revision.I would, however, observe, in regard to section 5, paragraph 2, that article 164 of the Treaty of Versailles relates only to armaments as defined in the Table II annexed to that section of the Treaty, i.e., land war material.A. H.May 12, 1931.Minute by Sir C. Hurst.Disarmament.LORD CECELS question is : &quot;How far is it true that Germany&apos;s obligation to maintain disarmament is dependent on the Allied obligation to formulate a scheme of disarmament1?&quot;I append a memorandum by Mr. Beckett with which I agree.If by the word &apos;&apos; formulate &quot; in the question is meant &apos;&apos; formulate and bring into operation,&quot; the memorandum shows that, except so far as article 164 of the Treaty of Versailles operates, the continuance in force of Part V of that treaty, regulating the naval, military and air force of Germany, is not dependent on the adoption of any disarmament scheme by the Allies. The obligation of all members of the League, including the Allies, to co-operate in disarmament flows from article 8.C. J. B. H.May 7, 1926.ENCEUSUKJi.Memorandum respecting Disarmament.MORALLY, as both Lord Cecil and Sir C. Hurst have agreed, there is a very strong obligation on the Allies towards Germany to carry out themselves a scheme of disarmament, which arises out of the preamble to Part V of the Treaty of Versailles (Annex (A)), the memorandum attached to the reply of the Allied and [6310] . d
Associated Powers of the 16th June, 1919 (Part V, Section I, paragraphs I, II and III (Annex (B)) ), and statements made at Locarno (Annex (C)) and else-where. The Allies have made declarations to Germany in these various places of their firm intention to do so Article 8 of the Covenant is part of the Treaty of Versailles and prescribes the method and machinery for the bringing about of a general limitation of armaments (in which the Allies will of course be included) which the Allied and Associated Powers agreed both amongst themselves and with all other members of the League to adopt (Germany, of course, until she becomes a member, has no rights under article 8).The reference to a general limitation of armaments in the preamble to Part V and in the reply of the Allied and Associated Powers, which the Allied and Associated Powers in these texts intimated their intention to carry out, must be references to a general limitation carried out by the method and machinery of article 8 of the Covenant, and by no other. Therefore it follows that the obligation, of wdiatever kind it may be, on the Allies towards Germany which springs from these texts is not &quot; themselves to carry out a scheme of disarma-ment,&apos;&apos; but can only be &quot;to work by means of the machinery of article 8 to bring about the general limitation of armament by all nations.&quot;Ihe limits to which the Allied Powrers have thus declared to Germany that it is their intention to disarm are therefore those prescribed in paragraph 1 of article 8, viz., &quot; the lowest point consistent with national safety and enforcement by common action of international obligations, taking into account the geographical situation and circumstances of each State.&quot; The disarmament which is imposed on Germany by Part V of the treaty is described as &apos;&apos; the first steps &apos;&apos; towards it. It does not follow that the standard of limitation prescribed by Part V is precisely that which is indicated in article 8 it may be more and it may be less, because, until Germany becomes a member of the League, she has no duty &quot;to enforce by common action international obligations,&quot; and, when she becomes a member of the League, the Council of the League may agree that the armament allowed by Part V is not great enough for that purpose and increase it (see article 164).I fully realise that this last is a dangerous argument to employ, though I think it is legally correct.2. So much for moral obligations. - Is there any legal obligations on the Allies towards Germany to &quot;carry out a scheme of disarmament&quot; 1 The passages from which such an obligation must be deduced, if it exists at all (viz., the preamble to Part V, and Part V of the memorandum referred to) only speak of a &quot; general limitation of the armaments of all nations.&quot; Therefore there is clearly no obligation on the Allies to carry out any disarmament themselves except as part of a scheme for the disarmament of all nations.3. The obligation on Germany to disarm to the limits prescribed by Part V was clearly (as Lord Cecil points out) unconditional. Is the obligation to remain disarmed (which is found in article 164) also unconditional?On what can it be said to be conditional, if it is conditional on anything ?If the condition is to be extracted from the preamble to Part V, it must be either &quot;the general limitation of the armaments of all nations&quot; (viz., the reduction of the armaments of all nations to the standard prescribed by article 8) or the &quot;initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations&quot; (viz., some general agreement which is a first step to the reduction to that standard though the limitation created by this general agreement may be less than that standard requires. In any case it has no relation to Germany&apos;s limitation under Part V).In either case it is the limitation of the armaments of all nations which is envisaged. Therefore, if this is a condition, it must be supposed that the Allied and Associated Powers made Qermany&apos;s continued disarmament dependent on all nations (including Russia) doing something, a condition whose fulfilment the Allies were powerless to secure. This seems to be on the face of it somewhat unlikely.The memorandum of the 16th June, 1919, Part V, Section I, paragraph I, is at any rate open to the more reasonable construction that the &quot;condition&quot; (if there is a condition) is that the Allied and Associated Powers will seek to bring about a general reduction by the machinery of the League of Nations.
4. On the construction, however, both of the preamble to Part V and of the relevant passages of the memorandum of the 16th June, the references to &apos;&apos; general limitation of. armaments &apos;&apos; are clearly not inserted in the form of either obligations undertaken by the Allies towards Germany or conditions on whose fulfilment any obligations undertaken by Germany were dependent. The preamble says: &quot;In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation . . . .&quot; That is to say, it constitutes a declaration by the Allies of the reasons why they are requiring this limitation of Germany&apos;s armaments. This is not the same as making Germany&apos;s obligation dependent on the fulfilment by the Allies of their own purpose. The memorandum of the 16th June shows this very clearly : &quot; The Allied and Associated Powers wish to make it clear that their requirements in regard to German armaments were not made solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume a policy . . . .&quot;; i.e., it is simply a declaration of the object of the Allied and Associated Powers themselves. In a legal instrument obligations and conditions must be clearly expressed.   They cannot be construed from such words as these.5. The obligation on Germany to keep her armaments within the narrow limits of Part V is unconditional.It is not necessarily perpetual. It duration is prescribed by article 164; she is obliged to keep within these limits till she becomes a member of the League. After that the Council of the League may modify them, so far as the army is concerned.Even if the Allies do not carry out or succeed in their intention of promoting general disarmament, it does not follow that the Germans &quot; shall be for ever kept in a condition of inferiority to the other nations of Europe.&quot; The Council, in acting under its powers in article 164, will take the existing state of affairs into, consideration.W.

As Germany increased her power, her neighbours had to follow suit unless they were to become
impotent to resist German dictation or the German sword. It is therefore right, as it is necessary, that the process of limitation of armaments should begin with the nation which has been responsible for their expansion. It is not until the aggressor has led the way that the attacked can safely afford to follow suit.The Allied and Associated Powers cannot agree to any alteration in principle of the conditions laid down in articles 159-180, 203-208 and 211-213 of the treaty.Germany must consent unconditionally to disarm in advance of the Allied and Associated Powers; she must agree to immediate abolition of universal military service; a definite organisation and scale of armament must be enforced. It is essential that she should be subjected to special control as regards the reduction of her armies and armaments, the dismantling of her fortifications and the reduction, conversion or destruction of her military establishments.Extract from, the Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference of October 16, 1925.THE representatives of the Governments represented here declare their firm conviction that the entry into force of these treaties and conventions will contribute greatly to bring about a moral relaxation of the tension between nations, that it will help powerfully towards the solution of many political or economic problems in accordance with the interests and sentiments of peoples, and that, in strengthening peace and security in Europe,,it will hasten on effectively the disarmament provided for in article 8 of the Covenant&quot; of the League of Nations!--------&apos;   &quot;   1 &quot; - ---*-    -- -^ They undertake to give their sincere co-operation to the work relating to disarmament already undertaken by the League of Nations and to seek the realisation thereof in a general agreement.IllAnnex (C).o
