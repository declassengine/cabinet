An Aspect of International Relations in 1931.1. INTRODUCTION.LAST year, in a paper bearing this title, I ventured, with the help of the competent Departments of the Foreign Office and our Ambassadors in Paris, Rome and Berlin, to draw attention to the period of dualism in which we are living. No events of a catastrophic nature occurred during last year to disturb or distort the tenour of Europe&apos;s political ways. This dualism, however, in international relations has become sufficiently marked to warrant a second bulletin (and this time a more thorough one), on the old Adam first identified in the memorandum of last May, for the purpose of studying the various manifestations of pre-war psychology that have lately occupied the Depart-ment and Europe. Only thus shall we be in a position to judge whether any progress has been made in curtailing the activities of this reprehensible character.In exorcising his spirit two essential points must be remembered beyond the preliminary remark that the views in this paper are only my own and those of my colleagues, notably Mr. Sargent, who have collaborated in its production. First, it is not enough to say &quot;no progress has been made, but, on the other hand, there has been no retrogression.&quot; If we are standing still, we are losing ground; it is the old story that he who is not with us is against us. Secondly, if it is now manifest that the old Adam has duration-  the projection of the past into the present this is only one side of the picture; and we must be careful not to underestimate the forces arrayed against him, or the extent to which he has been blown upon in the last dozen years. But with this other and brighter side of the balance-sheet, the League and all it stands for, this paper does not profess to deal, although it includes a brief section on the subject. Its object is to chart the rocks and shoals, and it might take as its text some words spoken by the Secretary of State to the press on his return from Geneva in January. &quot; The state of Europe is not what it might be. .... It is clear that the problems left by the war have not been so completely liquidated as some were inclined to think a year ago. I do not want to be considered an alarmist in saying this far from it.&quot; (The latter part of this statement had recently seemed likely to receive striking confirmation from an episode in which the Secretary of State himself figured largely. I refer, of course, to the Naval Agreement with France and Italy, mainly attributable to our diplomacy, an achievement which bade fair to mitigate one of the main causes of European unrest. Owing to the twelfth-hour difficulties raised by the French, this better augury for the solution of the problems now facing Europe has seemed likely to suffer a set-back. It is still hoped that this may be avoided; but the hitch has already again tended to impair Franco-Italian relations, and should it prove intractable, those relations must inevitably drift again into their old bad habits.)In order that these problems may be thoroughly examined, it has seemed wise to study the situation from the three different angles of nationalism, economics and international co-operation. First, therefore, an endeavour will be made to give a brief picture of the Nationalist aspect of European politics; secondly, the connexion, nowadays so marked, between politics and economics will be similarly treated; and thirdly, the position as regards co-operation between the nations will be reviewed in the light of recent developments in the League of Nations.The conclusion reached in the last memorandum was that &quot; the conflict is still between the &apos; haves &apos; and the &apos; have-nots,&apos; between France and her entourage on the one hand, and on the other Germany and the ex-enemy States, with italy tending to replace Germany as their leader. At this rate, in the future there may be three candidates for the hegemony of Europe : (1) France, who might be described as the holder of the cup; (2) Italy; and (3) Germany, who will be strong runners-up so soon as they have trained into form at home. There will also be during this period continual play with the idea of combinations between two of [5185] B 2
the three candidates, complicated by threats already uttered, and the possibility of bringing Russia in for a foursome.&quot; Thus the continent is still riddled with pre-war thought. Alongside the ideals of the League, the pacts, arbitration and disarmament, material and moral, still runs the old diplomacy, with its alliances, insurance and reinsurance treaties, balance of power, military values, and the economic theories represented by tariff walls and tariff combinations.&quot;Not merely do the tendencies of old statecraft thus described in last year&apos;s memorandum still continue to disturb international relations; it must be ruefully acknowledged that fluid circumstance conspired during 1930 to solidify these tendencies into something very like factual matter. Above all, the world-wide economic depression of last year has had all over the world its political reper-cussions, and, however different these may be in individual countries, it may be confidently asserted that everywhere they fanned the flame of nationalism, and spread! a vague feeling of fear throughout Europe, which in turn extended even to South America. For the first time since the peace people talked of war, foolishly, no doubt, as of a thing no longer unbelievable and impossible. It became once again a possibility in the mind of man, and from what is possible to the next epithet is but a step for imagination. This frame of mind, in so far as it has been induced by economic causes, may pass again when those causes are removed. Meanwhile it has been doing daily mischief, undermining the hopes and ideals of the last decade, and tempting one Government after the other to turn for security to the old weapons of militarism and alliances, to tariff walls and industrial isolation; while in the work of international co-operation and mutual assistance, although all still pay lip-service to these ideals, the popular jealousies, fears and suspicions aroused by material stringencies and economic confusion tend to make it difficult for Governments to commit themselves generously to any broad-minded and far-sighted solution of Europe&apos;s political problems.Thus Hitlerism in Germany and Fascist bellicosity in Italy to take the most glaring examples are in large part symptoms of an economic disease. Public opinion in Germany and Italy, groping for a cure for these ills, has been inclining to turn from schemes of co-operation to national policies that seem to promise quicker and more showy results. Hence the cry for treaty revision, repudiation of reparations, and the formation of diplomatic blocs, all of which were outstanding features in 1930.One of the recent, and more remarkable, of the by-products of the economic depression, with a due admixture of political ingredients, is the proposal for a customs union betAveen Germany and Austria. As a purely economic phenomenon it might, in happier circumstances, have been hailed as a fruit of economic wisdom, and men might have said that in this case at least some good had come out of the evil of the economic depression. But the elements are as a matter of fact so mixed up in the scheme of these more later that its immediate effect has been to stir up all the qualms and jealousies between the &quot; Haves &quot; and &quot; Have nots &quot; in a degree that threatens far-reaching damage if the scheme materialises in its present form; and even if it is eliminated or sublimated into something else  it is likely to leave behind it a deposit of Avry suspicions.We cannot, then, be blind, in attempting the harvest of a quiet eye, to the other side, which is the growth of this old Adam; for the dissipated wretch, far from being dissipated altogether, has been actually putting on weight. At his age and ours this seems a strange phenomenon to accompany symptoms like the boom in anti-war literature, striking in bulk, quality and circulation; but it is a fact, and! demands &quot; selective attention.&quot; In growing he has forgotten, sometimes wilfully, a great deal and has learnt nothing, not even that in a showery-tempered world the rain of a second far outweighs the sunshine of a century. Most of his recruits never knew the Avar; and the fiercest rancours are usually felt by those Avho have suffered, but not much. Yet it is not enough to dismiss them as reactionary. It must also be asked against what are they reacting, for that is a sign of vitality; and there are high-minded as well as high-handed people among them.We may begin with the smallest causes of old Adam&apos;s growth. One of them is a press largely in dangerous hands, such as the quintet of puissant brayhards, Hugenberg, Hearst, Rothermere, Beaverbrook, Coty. The standards of journalistic intelligence have risen while the standards of journalism are still Ioav. This, however, is no place for an examination in detail of the influence of the press in modern politics, nor of the question how far the application of the third degree to facts distorts the
minds to which they are in turn applied. It must be added that the influence is in any perhaps in every case easily exaggerated. Even in the spirit of old Adam there is a majority against pulping the tree of knowledge. He owes his buoyancy to many other visible causes, such as the aforesaid economic depression and the disillusionment that is almost the same as, or results directly from, devitalisation. (To this category of phenomena belong the post-war weakening of religion and growth of egotism.) He gains, moreover, from the shortness of unpleasant memory-sensations, and from those countries of the mind where the boundary between reality and filmland is ill-defined. A talkie belief in force and actual recourse to force are, however and happily, two very different things.But, quickly dropping all general considerations, I would point out that his existence is partly due to one plain, political fact the Peace Treaties of 1919. The part is large; indeed, in politics, the part is sometimes greater than the whole. The world now begins to regret that the democrats of 1919 did not imitate the moderation of the oligarchs of 1814 and 1815. Considering the length and magnitude of the provocation and the spirit of the times, those two acts of restraint stand, as restraint always does, among the all-highest wisdom.^) Statesmen then at least saw that nothing is so intolerable as a martyr, and that whenever old Adam is wrong he will cry out that he is wronged with more than his normal hundred square yards of lung. Now the terms of 1919 went too far, not individually, perhaps, but cumulatively. In the main they were presumably intended to render Germany harmless for so long as possible. It is difficult to understand how they could have been taken for more than a tale, where everybody lived happily ever after for a quite a little while.Surely it is by now plain that the little while is running out. So relatively moderate a person as Dr. Kaas, leader of the Centre party, has stated that &quot; the idea of revision and evolution is alive and will not disappear again from the political agenda.&quot; He has also referred to the housebreaking potentialities of the &quot; German Samson,&quot; not mentioning that Samson was blind. Perhaps an ordinary life-size Gulliver, bound by the threads of Lilliput and liberating his left hand, would be a nearer simile. Germany is, indeed, bound by subscribed principles, and some Nazis have given a disclaimer of intention to violate them. But to their minds principles are not violated; they suffer, or enjoy, a lapse from virtue. As a matter of fact, Germany is already indulging in minor infractions of her disarmament obligations, and would have little difficulty in throwing off more without fear of &quot; sanctions &apos;.&apos; other than the Lilliputian darts of reproach.Further, after 1918, some people expected the immoral chess of politics to die out; but they have been as wrong as Capablanca in anticipating the end of the game. The group system, in being among the &quot; haves,&quot; in becoming among the &quot; have-nofis,&quot; gives most unpalatable food for thought. For instance, while French policy has done much to push Italy tOAvard the latter group, France has begun to realise that her group, with the exception of Yugoslavia, is either not worth much for &quot; practical&quot; purposes, as in the cases of Roumania and Czechoslovakia, or may be more of a commitment than an asset, as in the case of Poland. Plence her nerves. And what has been the consequence ? Let me take three quotations among the many that would be possible. &quot;As a result of my recent short trip in Western Europe,&quot; Avrote our Ambassador in Berlin, in the latter part of last year, &quot; during which I went both to Rome and Paris, I formed the impression that the international atmosphere is worse now than at any time since the end of the Avar.&quot; This on the political side. On the economic here, too, all local observers have become more pessimistic I would cite the whole of M. Colijn&apos;s speech of the 14th January, on the project for economic disarmament, Avith its conclusion : &quot; The picture I have painted is dark.&quot; I need hardly say that this conclusion is widespread in financial circles everywhere. On the side of spiritual apprehension, the Pope, in an address this last Christmas, pointed out that it was difficult for peace to preArail between the nations if there were to be a reign and diffusion of &quot; an egoistic and unbending nationalism,&quot; which he defined as &quot; hatred and envy in place of a mutual desire for good, suspicion in place of fraternal confidence, competition in place of co-operation, ambitions for hegemony and empire in place of respect for and protection of all rights, including those of the weak and small.&quot; One side of these balanced phrases is pure pre-war.   The nations of Europe still tend, in(l) &quot; Nothing that could instigate France to another war ought, in Wellington^ view, to be imposed upon her.&quot;   British Foreign Secretaries.
Whistler&apos;s phrase, to be overcome by an undue sense of right from which the-Holy Father himself is not exempt in respect of Malta.The preceding paragraphs are plain speaking, for facts cannot be grasped without facing them. But the picture, with all deference to M. Colijn, must be a complete one. Let us, therefore, get away from any suggestion of undue alarm. There is at present no more than cause for grave preoccupation, for all that Homo Sapiens is still liable to palaeolithic homesickness. There is all the difference in the world between hostility and hostilities. The general desire to avoid war is increasingly and encouragingly strong, and common sense is not so show a traveller as the cynics suppose. Even in Germany the Zeitgeist is dualised for our comfort, and the Socialists are still by much the largest individual party though the revisionary ferment is in the midst of them also, and the editor of the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; can talk like a Junker when heated to the requisite temperature. There are also those normal beings who are not Aristotle&apos;s &quot;political animal,&quot; and would be sufficiently interested in beer, breeding and good health to feel no draught from the Polish Corridor, unless they were constantly reminded of it. The rival Latin Eves too, for all the alarmists who may whisper that they are at the mercy of a frontier incident, will long halt between the slogans &quot; Eat More Fruit&quot; and &quot; Safety First,&quot; even though the wrath of Latins is not, as so often hoped, of the soupe au lait variety; they not only get cross quickly, they stay there. We have employed much dubiously requited endeavour in their importantly trivial naval controversy to persuade them to look at each other less like two; china dogs on a mantelpiece. I am the first to admit that old Adam is no laughing matter, but he must be taken with a grain of salt, as well as with that blessed word cnrovSauoTrjs, or &quot; appropriate-seriousness.&quot; And we must take account of, and make allowance for, the effect upon judgment of the wave of pessimism that has been sweeping the world and is still far from spent.All the same, 1930 was a disappointing year. We had hoped that evacuation, commercialisation of reparations, and the freeing of Germany from economic control, would produce a detente. The Germans, missing a great opportunity for silence, promptly opened their mouths wider than ever, a tendency that received great impetus from the elections; and as one shouts so is the echo. Italo-Yugoslav conversations were resumed at Geneva, but there is no definite change as yet to chronicle in their relations, for which the fault lies mainly with Italy; and there had been little change in Franco-Italian relations, for which the fault is less easily distributable, until escape was sought from the word &quot; parity,&quot; which acts as a red rag to a bull or a Latin tag to a backbencher. Signor. Mussolini cannot escape responsibility for his year of lamentable spate. His qualities of greatness, aside from finance and foreign affairs, are incontestable, but, with an eye to France, it may indeed be said : &quot; There is so much danger in talking that a man strictly wise can hardly be called a sociable creature.&quot; Again, however, the bark is worse than the bite though much barking is a weariness of the neighbours nerves and there is, moreover, nothing new in this; Franco-Italian relations have long been a hunting-ground of old feuds, unaffected by change of personalities, where men who are equal to the same thing are unequal to one another.(2) It must be added that, in Sir Ronald Graham&apos;s opinion, there was some slow progress in the right direction during 1930, though with almost equal retracing of steps. Nothing has happened to cause radical modification of last year&apos;s views; but recent months have seen an undefined, and perhaps undemonstrable, awakening to &quot; the fact that in international co-operation lies the only hope of salvation.&quot;The background thus adumbrated will be filled in by the following pages, and in the conclusion it may be possible to make some suggestions. But, before passing to the first chapter, a last word may be repeated. During the last year, on many sides,&apos; there was too much stout intellectual unwillingness, too much persistence in old mental frameworks and fireworks, above all, too loose chattering of war. The homing flocks of Americans were noticeably affected this autumn, as were also some visitors from the Dominions. This chattering our represen-tatives abroad have received instructions to combat; but, harmful as it is, we-must take it less literally than the Americans, for monkeys still seek the lofty sentiment of the tree-top, which preserved and developed our species when carnivores were abroad.(-)E.g., &quot; Als Bismarck und nach ihm Caprivi-Holstein dem &quot;Wunsche Crispis, bald zu einer gruhdlichen Auseinandersetzung mit dem in Italien damals sehr verhassten Frankreieh zu. komraen, ktthl und ablehnend begegneten . . . ,.&quot; Billow:  &quot; Denkwiirdigkeiten,&quot; vol.

2.-POLITICAL ASPECTS  OF THE EUROPEAN  SITUATION.In the political sphere the outstanding factor during 1930 was the develop-ment of the cleavage which splits Europe into the two camps already mentioned. It will be convenient, therefore, to treat States under three headings the anti-revisionists, the revisionists and the onlookers.(A.)-ANTI-REVISIONIST COUNTRIES.It is obvious that the policy of France and her followers, who constitute the anti-revisionist camp, is of necessity less spectacular than that of their rivals. By its very nature a conservative policy is opposed to sensationalism, being based on the status quo, which it is the dream of the opposite camp to upset. For this reason the casual reader of the press-and Iioav else can it be read might well incline to believe that the policy of the revisionist group provides the most squinting examples of the old diplomacy, and that France and the Little Entente are no more stained with archaism than a year ago. Only by analysing French policy during the last twelve months can it be ascertained how far this belief is warranted by the facts.(i) France.Last year in my survey I stated that France&apos;s one objective is security and -ever more security, and that to achieve this end she was working on the following lines  &quot; (1) She will continue to work for the &apos; putting of teeth&apos; into the Kellogg Pact, and, more particularly, for some insurance against Italy;(2) She will try to divert Germany from a dangerous foreign policy by offering to co-operate with her in the political sphere;(3) She will try to mitigate Germany&apos;s predominance in the economic sphere by means of industrial co-operation;(4) She will advocate the &apos; federalisation of Europe &apos;;But if these attempts fail, or, indeed, if they do not appear on further experience to give France the same degree of security as her present system of alliances and armaments, she will be tempted to treat them merely as passing experiments, and will rely as heretofore for her real defence on(5) Her traditional system of alliances with Poland and the Little Entente; and(6) The further development of her alliance with Yugoslavia so as to &apos; contain&apos; Italy.&quot;Of the attempt to put teeth into the Kellogg Pact little has been heard of late, which may be taken to mean that France has begun to realise that it is a policy unlikely to succeed, and therefore to be abandoned. On the other hand there is at her disposal the more promising policy of amending the League Covenant so as to bring it into harmony with the Kellogg Pact. By such amend-ment those wars which are at present permissible under the Covenant would be placed under its ban, and become subject to the system of League sanctions provided for in such case. The Kellogg Pact, although still without teeth of its own, would nevertheless by this method be fitted out with a serviceable set of League dentures. Would France be satisfied with this -substitute? The answer is doubtful. President Doumergue&apos;s speech of the 8th April is, in fact, ominously definite on this point. So long as the League cannot wield &quot; sanctions &quot; in the form of guns and rifles, so long will France have to keep her own powder dry. If the League is disarmed then must needs France be armed. An unpromising and familiar argument! In every walk of life it is a strong French trait to run great risks by not running small ones; and the course of the last fifteen months of naval negotiation is a fair illustration of the point.As to Franco-German co-operation, it will be seen from last year&apos;s memorandum that no great hope was entertained of feelers by a precautionary suitor to a sullen dame. Any attempt to co-operate politically with Germany has been checked by the growth of the Hitler party and the subsequent and consequent
outcry in the German press for moratorium, rearmament, revision of the frontiers. As if this was not enough, Mussolini also must needs raise the revisionary cry last autumn, although he clearly does not quite if at all know what he means. Perhaps there was no greater desire to make new boundaries than to hit old rivals over the pavilion. In any case it aroused all France&apos;s latent suspicion of &quot; encirclement &quot;-that ominous pre-war word and cast a chill over any further approaches to Berlin. It also delayed for the best or worst part of six months our endeavours to get France and Italy even talking of naval disarmament.To return to Franco-German co-operation, bad as were the prospects last year, they have now been made worse by Germany&apos;s sudden production  lamentably adamite in method of the customs union with Austria. This sudden and clumsy move by Germany has shaken France badly worse, indeed, than she has been shaken for a long time and if Poincare and other reeidivistes have their way, she might in her present mood relapse into something perilously verging on her old attitude of blockading Germany. For France from M. Herriot to M. Poincare&quot; the proposed Austro-German customs union is purely, simply and entirely a political move, the first step to the Anschluss and must be fought as such. Thus the whole of Europe, against maybe its better judgment, in any case by a bitter paradox, is being forced to treat what can be represented as the first step towards European federation as an objectionable political manoeuvre destined to wreck the peace of Europe.The delicate state of French nerves was then further illustrated by the pettish reception of news that the German Chancellor and Minister for Foreign affairs had been invited to visit England before the League Council meeting at which the customs union was-to be discussed. M. Briand had approved the visit, but the country denounced it as a betrayal. That public opinion should instinctively relapse over such a trifling incident into the per fide Albion mood is a state of mind that we must recognise. The same symptom immediately cropped up when Italy&apos;s first instinct on the French naval boggle was to bite us! This may be all pi&apos;etty Fanny&apos;s way, but we could wish her quit of old-world frills and vapours.After saying so much about Franco-German political co-operation, it would seem vain repetition to say much on France&apos;s third aim industrial co-operation with Germany. Long before the present situation arose progress had been stationary. German exports had increased and French exports to Germany had declined rather alarmingly from 1927 onwards; and it began to be felt that Germany, &quot;over-rationalised, over-producing, over-breeding and overdrawn,&quot; had overreached France in commercial treaty-making. The Saar mine negotiations, too, which at one time looked hopeful, had broken down, and in the purely industrial sphere the European cartel, to which both France and Germany belong, is struggling with serious difficulties. On the top of all this comes the projected Austro-German customs union almost enough to quench the last glimmerings of co-operation. But perhaps we are taking too short a view in looking only at its present havoc. It is, after all, not impossible that this ill wind may act, not as an extinguisher, but a bellows on the embers of economic co-operation I had almost said economic security not merely as between France and Germany, but for all Europe. It will depend on who gets there first -the statesmen of Europe with the bellows or old Adam with the extinguisher. It will be an interesting and important race.This brings us conveniently to France&apos;s (or rather M. Briand&apos;s) fifth article of policy, the federalisation or union of Europe. The hopes I have indulged in as regards co-operation are, I am afraid, all that I can offer in respect of M. Briand&apos;s ambitious but intangible scheme for unifying Europe. The more&apos;s the pity. Since last year&apos;s memorandum was written various committees have been busy discussing it, but the net result has been that it was damned with faint praise by all the Powers to whom it was submitted, and the prospect of its materialising into any security system which would satisfy France is so far decidedly meagre. The cynical are, of course, now saying that the Germans  not without Schadenfreude have intentionally hoisted M. Briand with his own petard by formulating this definite unionist policy.In a word, far from helping M. Briand in his policy of appeasement and stabilisation, both Germany and Italy have, during the last year, in their various ways developed their offensive against the staUis quo, and there are many in France who say that had M. Briand been a less &quot;good European&quot; they would not have dared thus to threaten France&apos;s security. The fact is that, although M. Briand still holds the helm and indeed weathered last year&apos;s storm, his policy has, in the course of the voyage, received a severe buffeting.   Moreover,
the weather is still stormy. The customs union with all its implications, not to mention the Disarmament Conference and its preliminaries, are going to be productive of some stiff squalls. It is not surprising, therefore, that France should be keeping in trim that alternative policy of hers, which she is always careful to have in reserve: the policy of purely military defence and her system of alliances, especially her use of Yugoslavia to &apos;&apos; contain &quot; Italy.In addition to furbishing her alliances, France is not neglecting the purely material aspect of her defences. Although, on the one hand, she has reduced her military service to one year, on the other she has spent  30 million on the fortification of her eastern frontier, including that with Italy. Old Adam lurks not only in the shadow of economic nationalism; he is still digging himself in among concrete pill-boxes surrounded by uncompromising barbed wire.As for the system of alliances, if M. Briand&apos;s liberal policy had carried any deep conviction we should probably have seen a weakening of French interest in these pawns of the old skin-game. As it is, although there may have been no spectacular tightening of the bonds, there has also been no relaxation. France has been as active as ever in the use of propaganda to strengthen the bonds of allegiance that unite her with her allies. Loans and blue generals are constantly emitted, war memorials unveiled, banquets assimilated in defence of the status quo. Nor have the satellite States been behindhand in treading the new pathf more delicately than the old.(ii) Yugoslavia.From the French point of view Yugoslavia is the most important link in the1 chain of alliances. Mussolini has, indeed, described the Franco-Yugoslav Treaty as a pistol pointed at the heart of Italy. This is, of course, in the tone of old-fashioned melodrama; but the existence of this treaty, and still more its implications, are on any view a considerable factor in preventing normal and neighbourly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. For the latter there have all along been three courses open honourable independence and reliance on the League of Nations, dependence on France, or subservience to Italy. At one time it had been hoped that she would adopt the first, but any such tendency was rudely checked during the last year by a wave of panic which hustled Yugoslavia into further reliance on France. It would not be particularly useful to analyse^ at length the causes of this sudden fear, among which equivocal dilatoriness on the part of Italy and suspect mating on the part of King Boris may be cited. One of its immediate results, however, was that Yugoslavia broke off loan negotiations with an international group headed by Messrs. Rothschild it must be admitted that she had the justification of some delay here and applied direct to the Paris market for the means of stabilisation and development. It is feared that in their present frame of mind the Yugoslav Government will interpret the word &quot;development&quot; in some terms of armament and munition factory.It is in Yugoslavia also that last year saw the most manifest provincialism in Time of Old Adam. The occasion was the proposed amendment of the Covenant, Avhich was frankly opposed by M. Marinkovitch one of the best minds in the country on the ground that it would make it impossible for Yugoslavia to avail herself of article 15, paragraph 7, in order to go to war with Bulgaria over the Macedonian question.Of the Macedonian problem (as described in last year&apos;s memorandum under the heading &quot; Bulgaria&quot;) all that can be said is that the patient still remains  in liverish company to be cured by some troubling of waters, and that meanwhile he will at any rate continue to be a possible germ-carrier, not merely in the Balkans but in Europe. It is true that during the last year &quot;incidents&quot; between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have been fewer and less dangerous than in previous years, and that gratifying progress has been made toward a settlement of the vexed question of Bulgaro-Yugoslav mixed properties. Yet, though frontier conditions be more normal, we may expect, so soon as it serves the purpose of the uncontrollable Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, who secretly control the fate of the unfortunate Macedonian peasantry; to be shocked by some new outrage. So at least say the local gunmen, unless their milder members can deliver the goods quickly. The latent, or inherent, trouble is aggravated by the fact that the dearth of men in Europe is most marked in the Balkans proper, and in Bulgaria in particular. To this there may be a retort that it is the calibre of circumstances, and not of men, that has altered.[5185] c
(iii) Poland.The second pillar of France&apos;s treaty edifice is Poland. A year ago signs were not wanting that Poland was beginning to grow restive under French tutelage, and to feel herself strong enough to strike out a policy of her own; but the events of the past year, both outside and within her frontiers, have caused a return to the old position.As in the other countries ruled by dictators, the economic crisis, which affected Poland with increasing severity during the year, had the effect of discrediting the Government politically as well as economically. The opposition to Marshal Pilsudski, seemingly paralysed a year ago by the apparent material successes of his regime, raised its head again, and the Dictator soon felt that he must fight for his political life. He appealed to the country and &quot;made&quot; elections a widespread industry as ruthlessly as he dared. At this juncture the Nationalist agitation in Germany gave him the chance to beat the patriotic drum; and his agents in Upper Silesia beat it, and the local Germans  who resented it the more that they used to do the same in &quot; better &quot; days to such effect that the Polish Government had to face serious charges of man-handling the minorities treaties. A similar situation has arisen with the Ukrainian minority in Eastern Galicia and is a symptom of the same internal strain. Simultaneously, the perennial disputes between Poland and Danzig are again coming to a head, and the general discussion of the Corridor question, covert even in France, has further alarmed and irritated both Marshal Pilsudski&apos;s Govern-ment and Polish public opinion.The Poles, in fact, are now in a thoroughly nervous state. Their national character is such that this nervousness only makes them the more obstinate and uncompromising in all questions at issue with their neighbours, the less inclined to consider alternatives to reliance on armed force and French support.(iv) Roumania.There remain Czechoslovakia and Roumania, Of the latter little need be said, except that to her allies, France and Poland, she is more of a liability than an asset on account of her inefficiency and weakness, more especially since rumours of a Bolshevik invasion of Bessarabia cause recurrent staggers. This fear is more than likely to be realised in time : Soviet concentration and large orders for flying boats in the Black Sea point in this eventual direction, apart from ordinary political antennae. Meanwhile the return of crapulous Carol has been less the auspice of a better age than was hoped at first, and comprehensible, blush. The last Roumanian loan cost him 10 per cent. Financial France one of the several Frances is not susceptible to political tenderness.(v) Czechoslovakia.As for Czechoslovakia, &quot;the arsenal of the Little Entente &quot; with a talent for making enemies as Avell as munitions, she still continues her quarrels with Hungary, and her coldhesses elsewhere, besides generating some anti-German heat which comes to curious detonations. The ostensible reason was the showing of German films; the underlying cause is probably fear of Germany&apos;s recrudescence. Czechoslovakia, like Poland, has an uneasy feeling that she is no longer France&apos;s pet, or even reliably her protege, and that she might one day find herself abandoned by her ally, if the latter were to continue her policy of understanding with Germany and European federalisation. This has made for disquiet which, far from conducing to restraint, takes the form of nagging at neighbours and petty outbursts of &apos;&apos; hate.&apos;&apos;An instance of this is the occasion over which the somewhat waning M. Benes waxed so hot last autumn to wit, the coming of age of the callow Archduke Otto. He was convinced that the event would bring about the restoration of the Habsburgs at Budapest, and he excitedly reminded the Great Powers that they had in 1921, in very different circumstances, extracted from Hungary an undertaking not to do so. If a restoration were now attempted, he threatened, Czechoslovakia would at once close her frontiers and break off relations; and if the League Council failed to give her what she wanted, she would
go to war with Hungary. No restoration was, of course, attempted whatever the future may hold-and M. Benes&apos;s menaces did not materialise. There is room for reflection when the jeune premier of the League still finds it necessary to treat the internal administration of another member as a casus belli and manages partly to&apos; stampede his associates. It is to be hoped that the Powers may shortly be disengaged from such early post-diluvian entanglements, and the matter remitted where it properly belongs -to the League.But what has naturally upset poor M. Benes more than anything else has been this threat of an Austro-German Customs Union. His hysterical speeches have displayed a mixture of remorse that he had not prevented it by himself creating a Danubian union, of wounded pride that he should have been jockeyed into the undignified position which might eventually force Czechoslovakia to join the German union and, last but not least, of fear lest this should be the beginning of a new German Drang nach Osten, One may smile at his wounded pride, but his remorse and his fear are justified. Czechoslovakia^ position  geographic and economic is such that her lot would be unpleasant and perhaps-untenable, if Germany and Austria were united commercially. A S.O.S. has been sent to Paris to save Czech independence and France is fully alive to the importance of responding to the call. It is the manner of her response which is going to be instructive.(vi) Belgium.Belgium is usually considered as within the French orbit, and it is certainly true to say that France regards Belgium as her first line of defence in a war with Germany. At the same time, France cannot be sure that Belgium&apos;s &quot;path in the continuum will be as regular as that of the otiher satellites. At the moment there is a fall in French stock in Belgium, and the present Coalition Government have made it clear that they do not intend to be dragged into conflict at France&apos;s chariot-wheels. Such a declaration of independence is the easier since there are really few charioteers in France. M. Jaspar and other Belgian politicians have informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels that Belgium&apos;s responsibilities in the international sphere are absolutely limited to those engendered by the Covenant, the Treaty of Locarno and the Pact of Paris; and that the Franco-Belgian Military Agreement can only be invoked in the case of unprovoked aggression by Germany, each party maintaining the right to decide for itself whether such a casus belli has arisen. A Socialist Government under M. Vandervelde would take a similar line. Belgium, too, is preoccupied with spending, but not heavily, on frontier defence. In general, she is showing more reliance on the League of Nations, but French influence is still strong, and it is uncertain whether Belgium, in a crisis, would be able to resist the gravitational force of France.This brief survey shows, I think, that in the anti-revisionist camp circumstances during the past year have, on the whole, favoured the revival of the diplomatic methods of the old Adam. &quot;We must be thankful that the policy of these Powers has not, in practice, deteriorated further; but continuance of the present pressure, unless safety-valves be found, is bound to create an atmosphere native to him. This brings us to the revisionist Powers, for it is they who are how chiefly straining the international relationships of Europe.(B.)-REVISIONIST COUNTRIES.It is in the revisionist camp that during the past year the most important changes have occurred, changes exerting a profound influence on the whole of Europe. The occupants of this camp are Germany and the lesser ex-enemy Powers on the one hand, and Italy on the other.(i) Germany.In last year&apos;s memorandum I wrote that Germany was at the beginning of a new epoch.  How was she going to proceed %   &quot; Is she about to concentrate her efforts deliberately and openly on the Polish question and rearmament, or is it safe to assume that, although these be her goals, she will rather, for the time [5185] c 2
being, not show her hand, but devote herself to internal consolidation, meanwhile participating in any current schemes of international co-operation without committing herself politically? The answer probably is that it is too soon to judge, and that Germany herself does not know.&quot;The German elections have now given the answer. The rise of the National Socialists shows that, even if the Germans still do not know what they do want, they know full well what they don&apos;t want: &quot; We do not want the new Europe to be built on the foundation of Germany&apos;s greatest downfall.&quot; Last year, in dealing with the National Socialists, I said that &quot; under the leadership of the ridiculously dangerous demagogue Hitler, they make the best or worst of both worlds, preach a combination of militant socialism and militant nationalism, with uncompromising hostility to the peace settlement and the policy of fulfilment. Incidentally, they are almost fanatically anti-French, and have strong sympathies with the Italian Fascists.&quot; Apart from other sounds of feline flirtation, it was noticeable that their Christmas messages from the housetops contained something of the same plangent ill-will towards men.Last May they were still feeble, though the results of the local elections led to the notion that they were waxing. The warrant for this belief was found by the general election of September 1930, the most significant feature of which was the Nazi avalanche. Their success at the polls may be largely attributed to economic depression and youth&apos;s light head, filled from vindictive and distorted text-books, to which 6 nddcov fjidOojv is a stranger; it need not necessarily be mter-preted to mean that so large a block of the country favours a provocative foreign policy in the immediate future, though, one way and another, there was an incontestable vote of eleven millions against constitutional government. The &quot; serious outbreaks of savagery&quot; in German internal politics vide the Government&apos;s latest proclamation are, however, already almost sufficient to confirm Treitschke. It may be admitted that the Nazi rise corresponds with the rise of emotionalism in Homo Sapiens, and that part of Nazi audiences goes to meetings as to a cinema by payment. A foreigner can, indeed, pay more than stall prices for a &quot; good &quot; meeting, that is, one where old Adam is raising Cain to some tune. But it would be difficult and idle to speculate what proportion of Nazi voter should be taken at his ugly face-value. Let it suffice for the moment that the success of the Nazis provides yet another example of the evil produced by the world-wide economic crisis on European politics. And as political Germany a country easily irrigated with mirage by an extremity of bovarysm acts up to a cultivated conviction of war-innocence, so, economically, she &quot; carries on &quot; as though she were the only pebble on the beach of adversity. She is, indeed, as &quot; difficult &quot; to satisfy as that imperious female need of sympathy when the male Las been kept waiting. Yet patience is necessary in both cases if life is to be peaceful.It is obvious that the next few months will be of the greatest importance to Hitler, for on his behaviour during this period will depend his ultimate success or failure, whatever we or he may mean by those words. He has retired from the parliamentary arena, and has declined to support the Stahlhelm in their proposal for a referendum in Prussia, on the ground that it was too risky and might still further discredit his party. Everything now hangs on what line of policy he proposes to adopt. At the moment it would appear that he has not yet made up his mind.Evidence is not lacking that the Nazis are beginning to lose ground with the older people, in the districts such as Thuringia where they had had their greatest success; but they are continually opening up new and hitherto untouched areas, where the parents have not as yet taken alarm at the excesses of their offspring. As a whole their membership is still increasing.After the astounding success of the Nazis in the September elections, Germany (both Government and people) was in some sort hypnotised, and it required time for this feeling of helplessness to wear off. The Government have now realised the weakness of the Nazis in the Reichstag; while the Republicans are taking a leaf from the Nazi book, and have organised a counter-movement under men who have discovered that they too can preach to crowds. All this entitles one to believe that the Nazis are slowly being forced into the defensive. They are rent internally, owing to the divergences between their tacticians and tlheir thick-ear brigade e.g., the quarrel between Hitler and Captain Stennes  they are in a bad way financially, and a drift is setting towrards communism. (Some of their most bitter and fuddled partisans have already landed themselves there; one whole block was really never anywhere else.)   A revolution on the
defensive cannot succeed&apos; and, though the speed with which the situation changes in Germany makes prophecy not only difficult but dangerous, we may perhaps draw the not too adventurous conclusion that the tide has turned and that from now on Hitler and his followers, unless tlhey can find some fresh appeal to German emotionalism, will slowly but surely lose ground. The Nazis would be, however, likely to decline for many months before there was any chance of their falling, and we cannot, therefore, put them out of our minds.Indeed, it would be shortsighted not to give a nuisance its due. We must admit frankly that there is an element of idealism or aspiration in the Hitler movement which can be summed up in the words so often used by his supporters, &quot; Es muss anders werden,&quot; or, in Kultur jargon, &quot; to conform to the criteria of the present is to risk racial existence.&quot; That is what the Duce also says without knowing what &quot; anders &quot; means. (It means that old Adam clamours at one and the same time for change and national immutabilities.) The movement represents an accentuation and acceleration of the movement towards freedom and equality. The aspiration to these nouns, which plainer people call a grievance, has come to stay, and is an element which every German and perhaps every other Government must take into account. It is bound, indeed has already begun, to exercise an unhealthy and contagious influence on the conduct of Germany&apos;s foreign policy.We have said above that the tide of Nazism appears to be on the turn, but Hitler&apos;s power for evil will not be exhausted for that. &quot; The evil that men do lives after them,&quot; and his propaganda is already giving a more or less permanent twist to public affairs. (It is worth while to devote five minutes to meditation upon the significance of the banning of &quot; All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot;) (3) It will probably take years to undo the effects of his influence, which may well endure long after the causes of the original warp have faded into the limbo of forgotten things. Though the causes be no longer remembered, national thought in Germany may continue to be perverted by the doctrines, until at last the doctrines themselves are distorted beyond all recognition. &quot; Men fight and lose the battle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat; and when it comes it turns out to be not what they meant, and other men have to fight for what they meant under another name.&quot; So it may well be with the Nazis.Discount it as we may, make every allowance for the German genius for doing the wrong thing and for making the worst of all possible worlds no wonder Voltaire ragged Leibnitz the outburst against the status quo, coming as it did immediately after the evacuation of the Rhineland, is not reassuring. We had hoped that the evacuation would serve as a sedative : it has acted as an appetiser. Second helpings of experience are best avoided by better table-manners; and the sudden appearance of Germany as Oliver Twist has naturally and seriously alarmed French public opinion, bringing, as has been said above, to an abrupt end most attempts at Franco-German co-operation. Even less reassuring is the whole manner, more characteristic of &quot; as far back as 1911 &quot;  an expression which I recently came across in a scientific work than of 1931, in which the scheme for the customs union with Austria was prepared in secret, and then announced with a suddenness and inopportunism which one would almost say were calculated if one did not know the Germans.There is, however, a more satisfactory side to the picture. In the previous memorandum it was stated that there was no outstanding personality in sight to educate public opinion and exercise a controlling influence over foreign policy. Since these words were written, however, Dr. Briining has risen to the occasion, and has shown himself a politician of no mean skill. Even that straightbackward Prussian Junker, Herr von Oldenburg Januschau, has described him as the first real Chancellor since Bismarck though the praise is not as high as it sounds. So long as the depression continues tub-thumpers, and all those with whom moral courage is indistinguishable from self-advertisement, will have eager audiences; but the Governments hand will be immeasurably strengthened if a revival of prosperity comes. Of any such revival there is as yet no sign, but there are faint encouraging symptoms of returning confidence.Meanwhile, in the political turmoil, how far have the aims of German foreign policy undergone modification during the last twelve months?   In the previous(3) &quot; The 1914 spirit (not so deeply hidden as might have been thought) was allowed to flare up for an unguarded moment. It was quickly shut away again, but the brief betrayal of this spirit in unexpected quarters was impressive and not easily to be forgotten.&quot; The Berlin &quot;Correspondent of the &quot; Times.&quot;
memorandum they were set out in inverse order of importance and urgency as follows: (a) The re-establishment of Germany as a world power, i.e., acquisition of colonies and mandates. (6) The &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria.(c) Rearmament, so as to obtain at least parity with Poland.(d) Drastic modification of her Polish frontier that is, the Polish corridor.(a) The colonial question is still only a distant ideal. Indeed, there are indications that colonial propaganda is to a large extent artificial and moribund. The German colonists are not discontented with British methods of government, and the urgency and importance- of the European situation have forced the colonial question, at least temporarily * into the background.(b) There is no reason to alter the opinion previously expressed that a. political &quot;Anschluss&quot; has lost some of its attractiveness, or anyhow its immediacy, in German eyes, while even in Austria it is at the moment less to the fore. The German Ambassador recently informed me, with some emphasis and exaggera-tion, that 90 per cent, of political Germany was now against the &quot; Anschluss,&quot; seeing the accretion of Socialists and Catholics and nothing else that Austria would bring to the already well-stocked Reichstag.In the face of such assurances, what are we to make of the sudden policy of the customs union with Austria ? As to the motives, I believe simply perhaps, very simply that Dr. Curtius was, as Lord Granville said of Lord John Russell, &quot; dying to connect his name with something.&quot; I believe also that the plan was conceived, in some German minds at least, as a measure of economic defence^ against Russia &quot; before Soviet economic pressure becomes too strong.&quot; I do not believe that Austria cried &quot; Come over into Macedonia and help us &quot; though Germany may need Vienna for a bridge into the Balkans for the simple reason that all Austrian finance and a great part of Austrian industry were so unpleasantly taken aback by the news. Nor do I personally believe that this coup was conceived, or is intended, as any preface or approach to a political &quot;Anschluss.&quot; But those who anxiously contend that it would facilitate any such eventual intention have an incontrovertible case. In any event, what is most significant is that such things are still possible, are still thought clever or essential there are many who secretly agree with this last adjective and are still capable of seriously disturbing the equanimity and equipoise of Europe. The boat has already rocked enough to leave a nasty taste in the mouth of its occupants I had almost said its inmates. But the mischief does not end there. The Secretary of State&apos;s wise and reasonable proposal for fitting reference to the League Council where dispassionate discussion might have extricated both parties without loss of face or temper met, though ultimately accepted, with an early reception by the German Government, which to most people had but one implication, or at least was so interpreted : Germany has not the League spirit. Unilateral and petulant affirmation of rectitude still seemed to her sufficient on the part of a Great Power. She may get over this unaffected pre-war tone, and acquire at least the manners of the League that she growls of leaving if it does not give her all she wants.(4) (There is a touch of blackmail in this.) Meanwhile, we shall be playing ostrich if we do not heed her hints of scepticism and her symptoms of infidelity.The test of Germany&apos;s true character will come at the forthcoming discussion of the customs union in the Committee on European Union. She can use the occasion to press for an international policy of economic reform, or she can use it in order, by process of blackmail, to try and advance Germany&apos;s political aims under cover of economics. The choice she makes will be illuminating and momentous.(c) The recent meeting of the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament had interesting results - as regards the last two items on the German programme, rearmament and revision of the eastern frontier. The negative attitude of certain Powers in the matter of disarmament caused a wave of indignation to pass over Germany. There is little doubt that revision of the eastern frontier has, if only temporarily, taken second place, and that rearmament is now the first aim of German policy. Rearmament is perhaps a misleading term; &quot; undisarmament &quot; would be a better way of expressing the state of mind which,(J) If the customs union meets with too strong opposition, Germany may declare that, if not allowed to help herself, others must help her; and, so saying, raise the reparations question,, adding perhaps that &quot; the economic distress of Europe is due to her mutilation.&quot;
while not aiming specifically at increasing the German army or reviving conscription, does very definitely rebel against continuance of the inequality between disarmed Germany and her armed neighbours. Germany is preparing to argue that since the ex-Allies (notably France and Poland) have not carried out the general undertaking to disarm embodied in the Treaty of Versailles, she herself is no longer under obligation to continue in a disarmed state. Feeling on the subject ran high, and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Reichstag passed two motions, the first requesting the Government to urge other nations to disarm, the second asking that the German representative on the Preparatory Disarmament Commission be withdrawn, in view of the refusal of the majority of the members to fulfil their disarmament obligations. Threats irresponsible, no doubt have again been uttered that Germany will leave the League, if the coming conference does not secure a measure of general disarmament which she considers adequate.It is doubtful whether the German Government have at the moment any clear intention as usual, they are playing the game of &quot;wait and see.&quot; A definite policy of rearmament, with a new generation that knows not conscription and a social democracy on the look-out for militarism, would raise all sorts of thorny problems at home, and is not therefore to be lightly started. But public opinion is becoming increasingly embittered by delay in effecting any general measure of disarmament, and failure of the Disarmament Conference would certainly be the occasion of a diplomatic offensive by the German Government. It is not suggested that they would necessarily tear up the military clauses of the treaty and start rearming, but they certainly would try to place the ex-Allied Powers in an impossible position by demanding the revision of Part V of the treaty. In fact, not without cause, such failure would be hailed by Germany as proof positive of the resurrection of the old Adam which would justify indeed force her to cease paying even lip service to the new dispensation.(d) As for the Polish frontier, no German is supposed to forget the lost provinces; in any case he is not allowed to try. In this the Poles are unwise enough to collaborate. Apart from the grievances of the German minority, moreover, Germany is well aware that Polonisation proceeds so rapidly that unless something is done she will soon have a worse case, for she is being outbred. (To patriots, not to parents, breeding is competitive.) But to obtain her ends even by peaceful means Germany knows that she requires military strength and possibly co-operation with Russia. Of both these considerations, therefore, she will not lose sight.For these reasons it may be said with some certainty that the two main objects of German policy (undisarmament and suppression of the Danzig corridor) will be run in double harness. Since Germany is above all an opportunist, they will, however, be driven in tandem, first one and then the other being leader, as occasion warrants. It may even warrant one being put behind the cart for a while. Opportunism is no crime in itself- we practise it ourselves without qualm but in the present German frame of mind it is apt to prove a pretext for considerable use of the old methods. This apprehension is bound to create a feeling of unrest and anxiety in Poland and, through Poland, in France.In addition to the four aims of German policy examined in the foregoing paragraphs, one new question of considerable importance has arisen, which has even threatened to take first place in the German programme. This is the demand for the abolition of the Young plan or at least for a moratorium. There has been considerable popular agitation in this connexion, fanned of course by the National Socialists, but it seems based rather on emotion than on understanding of the economic and financial position of the country. There is a very natural tendency to attribute the economic crisis, from which Germany is at present suffering, to the burden of the plan, and to ignore the fact that it is not confined to Germany. Dr. Curtius has on several occasions made it clear that, if the emergency programme fails to establish German finance securely, it may become necessary for Germany to claim a moratorium and even the revision of the Young plan. If the economic crisis shows no early sign of abatement it is possible that the moratorium will again loom large on the German programme, on which it occupies at the moment only a temporary place.In the light of the foregoing analysis there is no reason to modify the view previously expressed that the first criterion which Germany will apply in her foreign policy will be : &quot; How far will this assist me in getting the Polish frontier altered and in freeing myself from the disarmament clauses of the Peace Treaty?&quot;   She has in no way altered the essentials of her programme; she has
merely given proof that her patience is wearing thin, and the internal political developments in the country show that there has been a sudden growth of public opinion, which holds that it is in Germany&apos;s interests to look to the methods of the old Adam if a settlement of these major problems is much longer postponed.(ii) Lesser Ex-Enemy Powers.There are no important additions to be made to what has already been written about the lesser ex-enemy countries. Austria alone of the three has been comparatively calm until she was suddenly dragged into the limelight by Germany, who to make a shrewd guess exploited a sudden panic in Vienna in order to suggest the customs union as the only way for Austria to escape another economic collapse. Austria may have uttered the word, but it was Germany who coined it.Hungary still uncompromisingly demands back her old territories and once has murmured of leaving the League, aping perhaps some German scepticism of the League&apos;s capacity to &quot; make good &quot; (for &quot; good &quot; read &quot; restitution &quot;).Bulgaria, with equally adamite obstinacy, but with less frankness, watches for the occasion to recover those Macedonian territories which she has coveted in vain since 1878. So long as these thwarted ambitions and bitter grievances remain, both countries will fall an easy prey to attempts made by Italy to organise them into at least &quot; a diplomatic coalition&quot; she has in fact supplied them both with arms as well to counteract the weight of the Little Entente. There is no lack of evidence at the present time that Italy is seriously contemplating the execution of this typical piece of eighteenth century states-craft. Nor, incidentally, is her idea of an Italian-Greek-Turkish agreement calculated to reassure France.(iii) Italy.Though an ex-Allied Power, Italy now definitely belongs to the revisionist group. Her position is best illustrated by a quotation from the memorandum of the 1st May last: &quot; Italy has a certain affinity with the ex-enemy countries, inasmuch as she considers herself to have been robbed of her rights by the Peace Treaties. This gives to her policy a querulous and restless character which one would expect to find among the vanquished rather than among the victors. This feeling of frustration no doubt helped to engender the Fascist regime. Although, since Mussolini&apos;s advent to power, Italy &apos;s foreign policy has acquired a decided aggressiveness, it still seems occasionally to lack coherent objectives; or, to put it in another way, the objectives of Italian policy are so frequently modified and altered that, while the methods have a fallacious dash of Bismarck, they often have also the appearance of an irresponsible troubling of the pool with no higher object than that of blackmail.&quot; And again : &quot;1. Italy has never forgiven France for forestalling her as the predominant Power in the Danube Basin; 2. She wishes to take the place of Austria-Hungary as the arbitrator of the Balkans, and 3. She aspires to become the predominating Power in the Mediterranean.&quot;This description of Italy&apos;s feelings and ambitions still holds generally good. Indeed, at first sight there would seem to have been some intensification of the tendencies analysed in last year&apos;s memorandum, and Italy has appeared in many respects less uncertain than a year ago concerning the means to her ends. But for a time at least there appeared two signs of grace in Italy&apos;s attitude towards France and Yugoslavia the first tangible evidences, it may be said, of that-hesitating and reluctant advance in the direction of international co-operation already observed by Sir R. Graham.Throughout 1930 Italy&apos;s relations with France and Yugoslavia had shown no improvement. Neighbours never love one another, and States may be maddening; but this particular group alternates heat with a polar distance. So distant were France and Italy that it required a British intermediary to carry messages between them for several months in an endeavour to get the two Governments to say that they would not embark upon a race in naval armaments which neither of them desired.As for Yugoslavia, the usual attempts have been made to induce Rome to talk with Belgrade in the hope that frank discussions might reveal the emptiness:
of the quarrel.  After months of sterility there seemed at one time a faint hope-that the two countries might find in the maintenance of the status quo in Albania the basis for some sort of understanding.   This at first sight sounds eminently reasonable, but the Albanian status quo conceals a multitude of old Italian sins. In fact, it consecrates Italy&apos;s most successful effort since the war in imperialistic diplomacy, whereby she has established a virtual protectorate over Albania. Thus, we find embedded in the status quo the right of Italy (under the first Treaty of Tirana) to military intervention in defence of the internal regime in Albania, and, what is almost as bad, Italy&apos;s privilege (extorted from the Ambassadors&apos; Conference in 1921) in virtue an unfitting term of which the conference Powers agree to support her claim to employment by the League for the-protection   of   Albanians   independence   against   aggression,   whenever   the Council decides that such protection is needed.    Yugoslavia finds it hard to condone this state of affairs;  indeed, King Alexander recently informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Belgrade that his country would never recognise the decision of the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, and that all he wanted was a. common guarantee, without diplomatic subterfuge, of Albanian territory.   The position is meanwhile rendered even more unsatisfactory by the subsidies given to Albanian emigres by Yugoslavia,  and by the many rumours of Yugoslav complicity in the attack on King Zog, rumours which, however, would seem unfounded in view of the fact that the death of the King would almost certainly lead to immediate chaos in Albania resulting in Italian intervention  the last thing Yugoslavia desires.  If any agreement should materialise, it would be indeed a notable advance not only on the part of Yugoslavia but also of Mussolini, who so far has refused to depart from the fundamental principle that if Yugoslavia wishes to be friends with Italy she must give up her friendship with France.  This announcement has, at any rate, the merit of candour, but it throws an uncomfortable light upon Italian mentality; a grosser example of the spirit and method of old Adam it would be difficult to imagine.   This pretension to treat relations as synonymous with misconduct continues to poison the various attempts at compromise made from time to time, such as the proposal to replace the present objectionable Franco-Yugoslav Treaty by a triple agreement between France, Italy and Yugoslavia.   The French have shown signs of reviving or at least of trying some artificial respiration upon this project, which the Italians have regarded as still-born.The truth is that Italy, perhaps justly, still insists upon treating Yugoslavia as a mere pawn of France, and Yugoslavia on her side has not the vitality to demonstrate that she is no such thing. Thus the vicious circle in this respect remains complete; Italy will not live on neighbourly terms with Yugoslavia so long as the latter is bound to France, Yugoslavia dares not emancipate herself from French control so long as she feels herself boycotted and threatened by Italy, and France and Italy cannot easily establish normal relations so long as the control of Yugoslavia is for each an indispensable requirement of national security.Of late Italy, like the rest of us, has been hard hit by the economic depression, and the strain is all the greater in her case because her reserve of strength is limited, and because the Fascist regime is based so largely on material prestige. To counteract the political effects of the depression Mussolini was in 1930 rather more vociferous and truculent than usual in his speeches. He conceived himself forced perhaps to keep the gallery quiet and, whether by necessity or nature, to overplay the role of protector of a defenceless people surrounded by envy, hatred and malice. Another, and somewhat ominous, method, which he has recently adopted to consolidate the regime, has been the introduction of measures destined to subject the whole youth of the country to military training and Fascist discipline before the period of actual military service begins. To this spirit also presumably belong such manifestations as the banishment of foreign words and the alien jury system.Two other events of last year have given special impetus to the trend of Italian policy the disarmament negotiations and the German elections. The long-drawn-out naval wrangle intensified Franco-Italian rivalry in 1930; parity, after a year&apos;s discussion, was transmogrified from a theoretical demand to a vital principle of Italian policy. Mussolini saw in France&apos;s resistance to this principle the acid test of her attitude towards Italian aspirations as a whole, and in the face of such &quot; evidence &quot; of danger, Italian public opinion sought counter-measures of defence rather than[5185]D
means of appeasement. Italy has, for instance, brought in a system of military training between the ages of 55 and 8, so that it would be difficult, in French apprehension, to carry further a nation in arms, saving it should cry avanti at the breast. Incomprehensible as it may seem, Italian public opinion has been so worked up that the average Italian can be led to believe a heavy-weight France may attack a cruiser-weight but growing Italy in the near future. (A welter-weight Yugoslavia often thinks the same about Italy.) It was particularly unfortunate that in this moment of nervous irritation the German elections should have occurred. Italy hailed the Nazi success as foreshadowing the militarist renaissance of Germany, and inclined to explore the opportunity of this new force for Italian ends. As was explained in last year&apos;s memorandum, it has long been the hope of Italian foreign policy to establish some sort of contact with Germany and other ex-enemy Powers, which might have developed into an anti-French bloc. The German election shows, so argues the Italian &quot; realpolitiker,&quot; that treaty-revision is now the magic word with which to appeal to the German public. This is the cry that has contributed to sweep the Nazis over a hundred strong into the Reichstag, and that is bound to find its echo in Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. Though South Tyrol, for instance, makes treaty revision a most unsuitable &quot; release &quot; for a modern ^Eolus, Mussolini realises that future inconsistency must be risked for the sake of immediate gain. In a speech on the 27th October last, and in a Christmas inter-view published in a German Nationalist newspaper, he declared that Italy is in favour of treaty revision. By thus ranging herself definitely, if nebulously, on the side of the revisionaries, Italy has done much to consolidate the resentment of the defeated nations into a concrete policy of which she, a great Power, would be the leader and inspirer.It is not so much the revisionist policy of Italy, as the method, occasion and ulterior object of the step so abruptly taken, that I view with anxiety.It may be that we should begin to accustom our minds to the idea of revision as a long-range policy; it will indeed be found tentatively suggested in the conclusion of this memorandum. But that Italy of all countries should stimulate prematurely, and with a dubious and short-sighted aim, the hopes of those who envy France must be reckoned dangerous and retrograde.Italy&apos;s future policy is, as has been said above, now less uncertain, and it is worthy of examination. It seems probable that it will be threefold in form. First, then, it is likely that she will look northward. Germany is an opportunist; all is grist that comes to her mill, and she watched with dawning, and therefore slightly chilly, respect and interest the rise of post-Avar Italy. Owing to her present military weakness she feels herself in no good posture to press her aims, and would therefore be pleased to see an Italy under no such disability take the initiative in demanding revision. But in any such combination, &quot; il y a toujours un qui baise et un qui tend la joue,&quot; and we shall hear no resonant buss, for Germany, who distrusts the self-centred character of Italian policy, is unlikely to incline more than a proper cheek, unless France should push them into each other&apos;s arms. In no circumstances is she likely to make the first advances, for limber Italy has played her false in the past toooften to justifyfiaxen trustfulness now. Partie and altar seem alike dubious. Germany still remembers the turncoat of 1914, and suspects that Italy would be an uneasy bedfellow; but she will dally with Italian advances so long as she is not too far engaged or compromised.For the moment, any such co-operation between Italy and Germany will take the form of reciprocal assistance in the Council of the League rather than of military understanding. Signs of this co-operation at Geneva were, indeed, apparent last year. Secondly, Italy has recently been trying to bind various small Powers into a group, of which the cement would be the common desire for revision, or at least sympathy with such a demand. At present it is difficult to judge what truth lies behind the rumours in circulation about the proposed pact; they are, however, of sufficient importance to create a suspicion that there is some flame behind the smoke. The bases on which Italy is working are the existing Italo-Turkish, Italo-Greek and Graeco-Turkish treaties. These she wishes to combine in a tripartite pact, and it may be assumed that in working for such an agreement she has two objects in view one political, and the other military and economic. First she desires to strengthen her influence in South-Eastern Europe as against France by making of the pact the nucleus for a revisionist bloc; and secondly, she realises that, m the event of war with France, it would be vital to her that the Dardanelles and the ^gean should be kept open for supplies from Russia.   The Greeks however are unlikely, at any rate so long
as M. Veniselos is in power, to be parties to any aggressive misuse of such a tri-partite agreement, although its conclusion may stimulate apprehensions in France and Yugoslavia.The third aspect of Italian policy which merits attention is the possibility of an Italo-Russian rapprochement. Here the position as regards Italo-German relations is reversed. It is rather Russia &quot; qui baise &quot; and Italy &quot; qui tend la joue.&quot; Russian jjolicy is of necessity to a large extent destructive, and wherever-troubled waters exist she is the compleat angler. For this reason she is likely to seek improvement of her relations with one or other of the Western Powers, since she dislikes her present isolation, and hopes that such a move would enable her to carry on with greater ease a policy of embarrassment.Though the Fascist political system is in some ways poles apart from that of the Soviet, Italy is obviously the most suitable partner for Russia to choose; for there is in other respects a certain similarity between the methods of the two extreme systems. (The Nazis indeed have been trying to make the two ends meet in a rare farrago.) It has been said that &quot; a tous les pouvoirs, surtout a un pouvoir nouveau, il faut un peu de grandeur dans leurs ceuvres et sur leur drapeau.&quot; Both fascism and bolshevism are comparatively new forces, tending therefore to seek this &quot; grandeur,&quot; notably in effort to consolidate the country by harping constantly ori* the dangers that threaten it from without. There is thus a certain affinity to be observed between the methods of Mussolini and Stalin. Moreover, Italy and Russia incline naturally toward each other owing to the similarity in the aim of their foreign policy. Italy is discontented with the present territorial position, and is in a better position than G ermany to gain their common ends. Italy, too, is seeking allies in her campaign for the revision of the Peace Treaties, and has long considered an attempt to enrol an essentially revisionary Russia as member of a troupe of quick-change artists. Let it be said again, however, that Italy does not want warfare for all such symptoms as the Hymn of the Dopolavoro, which is less the workers&apos; thanksgiving than &quot;the stuff to give the troops.&quot;As yet the whole situation is vague in the extreme, and it is therefore dangerous to indulge in prophecy, which has been defined as foretelling a morrow something like yesterday or going wrong. It is, however, probable that Italy will endeavour to improve Russo-Roumanian relations, not from altruistic motives but because she hopes that, were the attempt successful, Roumania would turn to her for support instead of to France as hitherto. The task will no doubt be difficult, but this stealing of allies and marches upon rivals is as familiar in the game of militarist politics played by old Adam as the organised barter between Italy and Soviet Russia is novel for industrial States.It is thus apparent that Italy is rapidly assuming, if indeed she has not already assumed, the role of leader in the revisionist group. It is also clear that she has chosen a line of policy which, if Mussolini&apos;s recent swerve in the direction of co-operation is not continued and intensified,.may easily lead Europe backward toward the position in 1914, when that ignis fatuus, the balance of power, landed us in the bog. Circumstances have, as we have seen, conspired to assist this retrograde movement and, if the political evolution of Germany and Italy continues as at present, we can no longer assume that, the first step in the liquidation of the war having been satisfactorily completed, the second stage is necessarily going to be accomplished with equal success.(C.)-ONLOOKERS.Under this heading I would include not the whole of the rest of the world  for it would be true to say that the rest of the world looks on at Europe but only those States who, while their interests and position would entitle them to take an active part in the national rivalries of Europe, yet prefer, for their own reasons, to look on so long as circumstances permit or it serves their purpose to do so. Such onlookers fall into three classes: Soviet Russia. Greece, the United States and ourselves.(i) Soviet Russia.Russia is a hostile Power with which we wish to pursue friendly relations. It is a difficult task, and she goes out of her way to make it harder.   The remarks on Soviet Russia in the previous memorandum still hold good; and the past year has shown, if anything, an increase in that negative influence [5185] d 2
which was there noted as Russia&apos;s sole contribution to the foreign politics of Europe. Actual military aggression has for the time being at any rate been rendered still more improbable by the internal difficulties, both political and economic, in which the governing clique in Moscow have involved themselves through the premature acceleration of the Five-Year Plan. These very difficulties, however, have caused an increase of hostility to the capitalist world, which the Soviet Government have deliberately encouraged in order to distract the attention of the Russian public from their failures.Countries where only the ruling element enjoys life must either be, or swear that their neighbours are, aggressive. Illustrations are too profuse for comfort. At the same time the Soviet Government, who appear genuinely hypnotised by their own propaganda into the belief that they are exposed to foreign attack at any moment, have endeavoured to forestall this attack, as well as to promote their other aims, by intensified diplomatic activity abroad, concentrating on the &apos;&apos; revisionist&apos;&apos; countries, the natural enemies of France, Poland, and their satellites. As stated in the section on Italy, the Soviet Government have made overtures, even proposing a military alliance, and, though Signor Mussolini and his Government have hitherto kept the Italo-Soviet entente on a strictly economic basis, they could apparently secure more for the asking, if they should decide, for reasons of their own, to embark upon a more aggressive policy. Similar overtures seem to have been made to the minor &quot; revisionist &quot; States, such as Hungary and Bulgaria; and every nerve has been strained to keep Germany and Turkey apart from the Western Powers.Soviet policy, in fact like the Communist creed remains as fundamentally aggressive as ever, and though this aggressiveness is not likely, for the present at least, to take the form of military adventure, this is merely because the Soviet authorities consider that their ends may possibly be achieved with less risk by their present policy of propaganda, economic development and the utilisation of other discontented elements in Europe. At the same time Russian military development is being steadily pursued. The Soviet active army of 800,000 or 1,500,000 if G-R-U. troops and frontier and territorial militia be included is the largest of our time, and, in the eyes of its neighbours, is organised for offensive rather than defensive purposes. (3) .The Russian is greater than the German difficulty in the way of disarmament. To realise this one must begin by putting oneself in the place of a border State convinced, and with some justifi-cation, that extensive military preparations lead to war whether labelled offensive or defensive, and that the next decade may Avitness definite old-fashioned Russian aggression (a) if all goes reasonably well Avith the Soviets internally, (p) if their nostrum fails to spread sufficiently by other methods. And to the minds of neighbours Soviet professions of disarmament carry no conAdction.We need here pursue no further this matter of psychology, and, like a recently condemned Russian professor, Ave must &quot; obstinately keep biology out of politics.&apos;&apos;- But, even from the more obtuse angle of this memorandum, there is a darker aspect of the feverish Russian search for insecurity, pursued Avith the same extravagant conviction as if an Irishman should refuse to Avalk the Cromwell Road. It is a primitive in j ectionable country, not yet irreligious but only anti-religious, being in that dangerous state where politics are religion though I suppose that most of us cannot preen ourselves on entire emergence, seeing that our economics are nearer to religion than to science. On the flank of Europe there is a crude block of 150 million people, increasing by at least 3^ million a year, dragooned to the mass production of hate, trained to perpetual &quot; shadow-boxing.&quot; Into these dim minds has been dinned, Avith no middle-register of rudeness, that they live in a world of tooth and claAv eArer ready to spring upon the Soviet purities. Soon no Russian will have heard anything else. He believes in ogres, magic formulas, si vis pacem para helium, and the whole outfit of wicked-fairy stories. The consequence of perpetually hoAvling wolf is not indifference among, neighbours, but lycanthropy at home. On such a mentality pacific professions would be.wasted, even if they ever got there : the Soviets never doubt what Europe says, they just don&apos;t believe a word of it. The curve of Russian military expenditure has accordingly risen higher and more sharply than that of any other country. Her military budget has grown threefold since 1924-5 alone. The Osoaviakhim a league for stimulating the martial spirit of the people, and encouraging every kind of preparation, particularly chemical and aerial, for(5) $.(/., the air force, also the largest of our time, consists mainly of long-distance bombers and observers, not of defensive chaser machines.
war is increasing its membership from 4 to 12 millions. The number of students at the Military Technical Academy has increased two and a half times during the last year. As in the case of Germany &quot; the use of poison gas is certainly intended &quot;; at least its use in all forms is actively studied and prepared.Thus, in the eyes of old Adam, a reservoir of his own spirit is filling, and in the &quot; emphasis of order at the price of freedom &quot; to be euphemistic-there is little chance of recalcitrance. To his mind the question is one of efficiency, and to that there is some contribution from across the German border, for to old Adam this weight of potential ill-will and docile pugnacity is a factor to be reckoned with. This is already the case all over Europe in varying degrees of acuity and anticipation, particularly, perhaps, in Poland, Germany and Italy. In the retail of life bad-tempered people usually get their own way, and this is apt to hold good of the wholesale of politics. The fostering of nerves and temper in Russia must be plain to all but the wilfully blind, of whom, by tradition and heredity, we have long been prolific in international politics. All that can be said in the extenuation of it is that it feeds on the constant international outcry against Russia. This in turn no doubt feeds on such &quot; ruthlessness &quot; (the Russian spirit in peace has conceptions mighty like the German spirit in war) as the treatment of men as tool-fodder; but it can only be deplored from the point of view of diplomacy, which should at least be an endeavour to take, a long view. Russia somehow seems to bring out the worst of everyone, particularly Russians. It must be said, in conclusion, that one of the difficulties of the Russian question  and a large question it is remains that everywhere it tends to get at once into party politics,(6) clouding or colouring a comprehensive outlook; for the purely internal politics of Russia, or any other country, &quot; have nothing to do with the case,&quot; and furnish no reason why Russian history should be written as if it were a dispute about taste.Two minor onlookers, Lithuania and Finland, perhaps deserve mention here  Lithuania, for the persistence displayed during the past year in pursuing the policy of isolation and cynical readiness to sell herself to the highest bidder, which she has adopted ever since she lost Vilna; and Finland, because the &quot; Lappo Movement&quot; threatens to throw the country back into a crude nationalism of an almost &quot; Nazi &quot; type.(ii) Greece.Although nowadays he acts on a much reduced stage, M. Veniselos&apos; performance is worthy of a passing and very honourable mention. In his small sphere he is working at the big policy of co-operation and appeasement, and his successes do him and his country credit. He has already achieved two &quot; impossi-bilities &quot; a complete detente and entente with Turkey, and with Italy a working agreement which does not alarm any of Greece&apos;s neighbours, and which has not drawn Greece, into Italy&apos;s orbit. He is not yet satisfied-nor should he be  until he has achieved yet another detente and entente with Bulgaria without alienating Yugoslavia, and with Albania without alienating Italy. When these two further &quot; impossibilities &quot; are accomplished the ground will be prepared for the construction the ultimate object of all his efforts of the edifice of Balkan federation. In admiring M. Veniselos&apos; courage and zeal, however, one cannot help knowing that in its essence the chef d&apos;ceuv7*e he is striving for is one which no single man can accomplish alone, and one begins to wonder where his necessary collaborators are to be found. Will they be forthcoming among the present race of Balkan politicians ?   The answer is more than doubtful.One is reminded, in contemplating this fine effort, of another man for whom a similar task has been waiting for the last ten years, and who failed, not from trying, but from mistaking bluster and fine words for broad vision and hard work.   I mean M. Benes and the problem of the Danube States.(iii) United States.To complete this survey the present position of the United States must be summarised, and in this connexion it is necessary to differentiate between (1) Anglo-American relations as they stand to-day, and (2) the attitude of the United States towards Europe and the problems of the Old World.As regards the relations between the United States and this country, a very striking improvement has occurred during the last two years, attributable in part to the determination of both countries to rid themselves, in co-operation with
Japan, of the growing irritant of naval competition. It is no exaggeration to say-that Anglo-American relations have probably never before been on a sounder basis than they are at the present time.While, so far as Anglo-American relations are concerned, we may look forward with reasoned optimism to the future, it would be idle to suggest that there has been  despite spasms of common sense any change in the pained and superior convexity of America. There may be, and is, a growing desire on the part of the &quot; Peace&quot; groups in the United States for more positive and less timorous co-operation; with other nations in the settlement of international disputes by pacific means; the severe economic depression after the bursting of the inflation bubble in 1929 has added to the number of American financial and commercial leaders who-suspect that all is not right with the long-continued policy of isolation. But the politician is still firmly attached to the old parrot-cries and catchwords. Notwithstanding American participation in the Kellogg Pact, and although the maintenance of peace is the corner-stone and commonplace of United States, foreign policy (since only by the maintenance of peace can the growing dependence of the United States on her foreign trade be safeguarded), there is little likelihood of the present United States Administration being willing to pay any insurance premiums. We shall doubtless continue to hear much about idealism from across the Atlantic, and to be furnished with many facile but impractical recipes for expediting the arrival of the millennium; but we must recognise that there can be no active American participation in European political problems in the near future. There will be no teething of the Kellogg Pact, or, indeed, any activity which by any stretch of the imagination could be described as the assumption of an obligation or a responsibility. This is u natural and unfortunate consequence of the United States having always been more-conservative than England. It follows from this that satisfaction at recent qualified support in our endeavours to solve the Franco-Italian impasse must not blind us to the inescapable fact that there can be no United States interven-tion against expansionist aims on the part of Germany, Italy, or any other continental nation. It may not be entirely irrelevant to note here that Mr. Hoover and Mr. Legge have recently expressed a desire to &quot; stage a fade-out &quot; in regard to the world wheat market, and then to resist behind tariff walls the depressing-influence of world surplus.For our present purposes it would be a waste of Central European time to-analyse in detail why the great matriarchy is not yet ready to see that to our small concerns also may be applied the maxim : &quot; So long as gravitation acts, no disturbance can be confined to any area less than the whole of space.&quot;(7) Our friends are still in the main nicely unconscious that facts become obsolete though incontestable, like the width of the Atlantic. We, however, cannot afford their warm habit of pulling the wool over their own eyes. The real reason why there are no teeth in the Kellogg Pact is not, as Americans pretend, because it is morally better so, but because they are afraid that even false teeth are a commit-ment. &apos;. It is easier to disbelieve in &quot;anything tougher than suet.&quot; In the American cosmos Providence lets the theatre and we put on the play; but the United States still want none of the risks or worries of management. Moreover, ;they may well have their hands and minds full at home. If they be faced with .any long-term crisis, there must be some question-mark against the future of this lawless and heterogeneous agglomeration. It is, indeed, the most interesting -specimen of the general problem just dawning on man, whether, having come through his night, he will survive the perils of his day. Meanwhile there are -signs in plenty that, absorbed in development, the United States have, as was rsaid of them long ago, &quot; talked liberty so long they had forgotten the necessity of government.&quot; The United States are in fact a dry land submerged by seagreen corruptibles. The point that concerns us is that, while they are weathering their own storms and steadying from the coming country to the going(6) A phenomenon distinguishing the 20fch century from its predecessors is the extent to which internal and external politics have become interlocked. The advantages of this increasing interest in the latter have of course to be bought, and sometimes dearly. For examples, among scores, i our two most recent difficulties the Franco-Italian naval irreconcilabilities and the proposed Austro-German customs union have been greatly complicated, even caused in-part,.by internal politics, which in the existing state of the continent are largely either incoherent or repressive, sometimes both. It is worth wondering whether there can be &quot;security&quot; in Europe until the corruption of her motley party spirits be overhauled.(7) &quot;We .expect an increase in banditry on account of the depression in the world silk -market.&quot;   Extract from a letter received, while writing, from Kwantung.
concern, the future of the world will largely be settled without them. The misfortune needs no emphasis. Of the Kellogg Pact then we must make the most, but not too much, lest they lie back on imaginary laurels, or think themselves out of the wood because they never saw it for lumber. These are bleak facts, but, since there is a ray in the cloud, and since what I wrote upon it in last year&apos;s memorandum is a fact not yet obsolete, I will venture to repeat myself : &quot; So seemingly negative a result may not, however, be entirely useless to us. If the United States can be persuaded, or, rather, can persuade themselves and to many it will be collar-work that, of all the European nations we alone are attempting to exert a sane and salutary influence towards the reduction of international friction and the maintenance of peace, Anglo-American relations should be the gainers. In a word, without any treaty or alliance, the United States could, through this country, exert an indirect but useful influence upon the European situation. This is a conceivable, if not a probable, eventuality. Franco-American relations have been much impaired, by excessive intercourse, among other things, and America&apos;s view of Germany is still affected by the war. Although so many Americans still look up to us with dislike, we may yet shine like a good deed in a naughty world, made up, in their xenophobe and heterogeneous eyes, of invalids with criminal propensities. Europe, after all, as shown in this memorandum, does sometimes go out of her way to look the part.&quot;It must be added that last year I also wrote that the American bonnet is haunted not only by the isolationist bee, but by the Nationalist hornet, and that tho old Adam is stronger in the New World than he is in this country. The last part of the sentence remains true, but the agreement of 1930 has resulted in a satisfac-tory dwindling of the hornet&apos;s drone.(iv)   Great Britain.We also may rank ourselves among the onlookers. For that very reason, and in healthy revulsion against the tendency to return to the group system, the Turkish Ambassador informed me recently, on behalf of his Government, that Turkey had decided to throw her lot into the friendliest and closest collaboration with this country. If this declaration stood alone, one might have been tempted to mild cynicism lest it came forth from feigned lips. But, as a matter of fact, there is a good deal of this kind of feeling, current or latent, and to it we owe les beaux restes of our influence. I do not intend in this paper to outline a summary of British policy. That was contained in the paper produced for the Imperial Conference.   But I should like to make two points.One is that British influence is still sought and desired by statesmen in Europe and in America who are anxious about the next ten years. It is a commonplace that, both in economics and politics, the world is lacking in leadership and direction. M. Briand gave such a lead at the Assembly in 1929, and we know that the President of the United States is hoping for such a lead from us now in the matter of disarmament. What can be done by disinterested mediation has been shown by the results of the Secretary of State&apos;s visit to Paris and Rome. But I would venture to repeat what I emphasised last year, that influence is still proportional to weight, whether that weight be military, financial or moral. In regard to the first and third, it is at least possible that France would not have acted as she has done in the naval agreement had she attached more substance to our goodwill. In regard to the second, several of our leading financiers have informed me that they have had analogous experience at continental meetings. We must be frank with ourselves and acknowledge that our influence has been impaired by the state of our own health, and yet more by alarming, even alarmist, rumours and bulletins. If anyone doubts this he may spend a week almost any-where in Europe and keep his ears open; he will not wait long for the assumption that we are going downhill. Now and again some quite good friend of ours, like M. Andre- Siegfried, will come into the open and say it with sufficient chapter and verse to convince a number of intelligent readers. For this the standards of old Adam are not alone to blame. We must indeed expect the state of our resources to be constantly appraised abroad, and such appraisement, if even approximately correct, must show that either we are ahead of, or Europe is behind, our times. For her own sake she has need of much downward parity. And, since in the course of this memorandum it has been necessary to offer much criticism of foreign spirit and mentality, it is meet also to draw attention to
3. ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE EUROPEAN SITUATION.Before we endeavour to arrive at any final estimate of the European situation as outlined in the foregoing paragraphs, one point should be strongly emphasised. It is nowadays impossible to divorce politics from economics, and in this section an attempt will therefore be made to examine the various activities of the old Adam observable in the economic sphere, where they are no less deleterious though perhaps less obvious.We have noted the prevalence in the political domain of that complex of prejudices, ambitions and fears which is impeding the progress of the principles enshrined in the Covenant of the League and the Kellogg Pact. In turning our attention to the&apos;domain of economics we might well be tempted to hope that here at least the spirit of old Adam would find no scope for his obstructive and destructive activities. The whole process of economics, especially in its modern development, is essentially cosmopolitan in outlook and international in method; it often ignores geographical frontiers, and its best achievements are based on world-wide co-operation rather than on competition. In theory this is irrefutable. Nor can it be denied that economic forces are capable of contributing largely to the affirmation of political stability and the furtherance of political wisdom. But, unfortunately, in practice it is found that these consequences only ensue when the economic forces of the world are working smoothly without friction and withouttwo failings of our own from of old. One is a disinclination to face facts, of which our commitments under the Covenant and Locarno are examples; the other is the desire to have it both ways our own form of dualism  as illustrated by the comfortable exertion of &apos;&apos; influence.&quot; But it just does not happen that way, and these irritating foibles have led to the other less founded, but as already shown traditionally and instinctively bandied, charges such as &apos;&apos; hypocrisy.&apos;&apos;My second point is that we ought again and again to ask ourselves whether we need to have a &quot;concrete foreign policy.&quot; For the past year I have been endeavouring to establish closer relations between the Foreign Office and the City, so that such forces as this country possesses may at least not be counteracting in watertight ignorance of each other. At a gathering of bankers which, in this aim, I attended last autumn we were trying to promote an international as opposed to a purely French loan for Yugoslavia the incidental reproach cropped up that they were often handicapped in willingness to co-operate by the absence of &quot; a concrete foreign policy &quot; on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governments -in the successive plural as compared with those of foreign Governments.The answer is, in part and immediately, easy. His Majesty&apos;s Government has repeatedly declared that the keystone of its foreign policy is the League, and the principles, the undertakings, for which it stands. But there is another answer. What foreign Governments ultimately, perhaps even unconsciously, mean by a &quot; concrete &quot; foreign policy pans out at something damnably like the old group system, which is, indeed, already again in some force. We have been consistently opposed to such a system, and, even if we were not, there is no group that we approve sufficiently to join. We are engaged again in assisting rash drivers to turn corners. But the profession of A. A. representatives, at the crossroads is not enough for &quot; the troubles of our proud and angry dust.&quot; We did that before the war and were called insular for our pains, as if continental nations were international. Nor, seeing the resurrection of old Adam, with chapter and verse of the Acts of his Apostles, is the League alone enough. The suggestions attempted at the end of this review, unprompted by the bankers&apos; reproach, may perhaps at least provoke the timely consideration and formulation of others to ease and complement our policy of the League. For this country is still pivotal. On her &quot; internationalism &quot; the event turns. Whether &quot; concrete &quot; forethought is now called for, as opposed to our straightforward pre-war opportunism, is a matter for opinion to which this review may contribute. I believe the conclusion must be that, in spite of the living dualism of the League plus, or rather minus, old Adam, Europe is drifting, and we shall not wish to drift with her. At least we have need to ask, and not to beg, a fundamental question; and it were well to ask and answrer soon for, even if we escape an international economic crisis in 1931, we are very possibly set for a considerable political crisis in 1932.
obstruction. The world and mankind being what they are, these Utopian con-ditions rarely occur. Above all they do not exist at the present time. For generations the economic processes of the world have not been impeded by greater or more numerous obtsacles. Everywhere the friction thereby generated is intense, and this friction shows no sign of diminishing. Such circumstances, far from being inimical to the old Adam, afford him unexpected opportunities for activity and mischief.But this is not all. We must not think that the economic struggle itself is merely a kind of growing pain which, though disagreeable to the body politic, will leave no unpleasant after-effects. It would be a mistake to under-estimate the effects of economic war as compared with military war merely because its processes are gradual and insidious instead of spectacular and catastrophic. Moreover, economic war is deadly because it is often the irritant productive of the political inflammation that may possibly culminate in military war. Most adamite wars have had economic origins, and the modern development of unbridled industrialisation, especially since the Great War, might well in future increase rather than decrease the strength of the economic factor as a cause of political antagonism between nations. As in the past these antagonisms may well lead to disaster, although nowadays, no doubt, the weapons of economic war are sufficiently powerful to make resort to cruder expressions unnecessary except as a last resort.No one, I think, will deny that the Great War gave an enormous and artificial impetus to industrialisation; in consequence the world is now threatened with over-production or, let us say, with the disorganisation due to unbalanced and unregulated production. To this fact may be attributed in large measure the economic strain and pressure now apparent in most parts of the globe. But my business is not so much with diagnosis as with the fact that, whatever the causes may be, a world-wide economic struggle of great intensity is developing before our eyes.On the one hand, Governments and nations, when they realise the strength of the economic forces working in spheres within their control, can rarely resist the temptation of using them in order (1) to help them to obtain an easier victory in their political fights, and (2) to supplement and reinforce their purely military measures of defence and offence. Thus the economic struggle grows increasingly nationalistic, and the more closely it is identified with the political rivalries between nations, the more embittered are those rivalries likely to become. On the other hand, these warring economic forces themselves tend to drive Governments, perhaps unconsciously but no less effectively, to mould their politics in con-formity with the dictates of the economic struggle, which they dimly apprehend but cannot control. Once the strength and extent of these inter-actions are realised, I think it becomes evident that, if we prescribe purely political remedies for the present-day problem of Europe, we run the risk of merely fumbling with superficial symptoms instead of attacking the root causes.It must not be forgotten, moreover, that in terms of the adamite mind and vocabulary war has come to-day to depend more and more on the economic factor, which, in the Middle Ages, can only be said to have come into question in isolated cases. It was not until the French wars of 1790 to 1815 that the industrial revolution had really begun, and the economic power of Great Britain was sufficiently strong to prevent Napoleon from making a success of his scheme for what may be called the &quot; federalisation of Europe.&quot; The climax Avas reached in the Great War, when perhaps the outstanding factor was economic, manifested on the side of the Allies by the blockade of Germany and on the side of the Central Powers by the submarine campaign.It may be asked in what consists the economic armoury available to the modern State. Apart from the traditional weapons of tariffs, bounties (both direct and indirect), and systems of licences and prohibitions, the industrialisa-tion of the present epoch has armed Governments with new and hitherto undreamed of engines of economic warfare. The chief of these is rationalisation, in which is included the cartel system. This new development is none the less dangerous because it appears at first sight to involve international co-operation. In reality, however, it lends itself so readily to abuse that its essential peaceful-ness is overlaid with a certain sinister perversion. Rationalisation can be turned into a most effective political weapon. It may assume either an intensely nationalist complexion, may be governed and controlled by State activity deliberately serving political ambitions, or it may serve purely economic needs[5185]E
and have no conscious connexion with the national policy. Germany and America are good examples of these opposite types. But whether from conscious political aim or not, these movements always produce a political effect, both in the foreign relations of States as well as in their internal affairs.It has been pointed out in a recent memorandum by Sir Victor Wellesley that, &apos;&apos; as an example of the possibilities of the cartel system, the late Hugo Stinnes may be quoted. He is said to have succeeded in controlling one-fifth of the entire production of Germany, and to have been interested in over 1,300 undertakings. Had he lived it is not improbable that he would have effected an amalgamation with the Rathenau group, thereby extending his control over a still larger proportion of the German productive machine. Small wonder that he so steadfastly maintained &apos; it is economics, not politics, that matter.&apos; Rathenau held similar opinions, and declared that industry and commerce could no longer be regarded as a private affair, but must be co-ordinated in a great trust working under a State charter and focussing all the resources of science and production. It is true, however, that, after the stabilisation of German currency, the huge mergers brought into existence by the financial magnates of the inflation period gradually fell apart. Nevertheless the dominant feature of German development to-day is the idea of large-scale and more solid industrial combines, as, for instance, the &apos;I.G.F.&apos; and &apos; Stahlverein,&apos; and the very significant fusion of those two old rivals, the North-German Lloyd and the Hamburg-America Line. The real assets of any one of these mergers might well exceed those of the whole Stinnes group. The Stinnes combine was a rank growth of inflation, and died with the dropping of the mark; but, if it is possible for such power to be concen-trated in a single individual, it does not require much imagination to picture the entire economic activities of a nation focussed in a few hands under the supreme direction and control of the State. &apos; Three hundred men, all acquainted with each other,&apos; wrote Rathenau in 1909, &apos; control the economic destiny of the Continent.&apos; In Russia we have already in the most complete form the single and absolute State control of all national activities, though we cannot yet speak of rationalisation in that country in the modern sense.&quot;The chief political consideration to bear in mind in all this is that the more perfect the process of integration becomes, the more nearly it approaches the condition of a State trading as a single organism, and the more nearly it approaches that condition the more it lends itself as an instrument of policy to the furtherance of political ends. Under the pressure of world competition this tendency is increasing. In fact, the most ominous feature of the situation is the danger of these economic forces becoming harnessed to a narrow and militant nationalism instead of the peaceful internationalism, to which they are more naturally inclined. The tendency at present is toward the formation of barely disguised monopolies, supported by subsidies and protected by embargoes and tariffs. By such control of industry, commerce and finance, a State is in a position to wage economic warfare of the most bitter type, and, being in this position, may be tempted toward an imperialistic policy. In that case, however, the imperialism will be financial rather than political imperialism, of the type which shelters behind the white-washed word &quot;non-intervention,&quot; defined by Talleyrand as &quot; mot metaphysique et politique qui signifie a peu pres la meme chose qu&apos;intervention.&quot; A notable example of this brand of &quot; non-intervention &quot; is to be seen to-day in America&apos;s tutelage of Cuba and Nicaragua.I hope that in this brief analysis I have managed to indicate what I have in mind in regard to the strength of the economic forces operating in Europe, and the danger of their consequences when identified with national policies. It would be hard to point to a Great Power on the Continent, in this our perplexed generation, where the danger may not arise; and, whenever such methods are practised in the regulation of foreign affairs, it gives rise to an uneasy suspicion that the principles of the League and all that they stand for may be stultified, ii not in the letter at least in the spirit. The framers of the Kellogg Pact were only thinking of military Avar when they called upon the nations of the Avorld to repudiate war as an instrument of national policy. But it is no less anti-social for a nation to use economic war as an instrument of national policy, and so long as it may thus be used the peace of the world can neA^er be established on a firm basis.If Ave look round the Avorld to-day Ave see everywhere countries busily perfecting their economic machines for the great struggle for existence that they see looming ahead.   In present circumstances we can scarcely complain that they
should thus seek to prepare themselves; but it is worth recalling that this attitude bears a remarkable resemblance to the situation in 1914, when the dangerous half-truth of preparing war if you desire peace was never out of the mouths of the statesmen of Europe. So long as this frame of mind persists, so long will Europe, and America too, be threatened with war, no less fatal to the peaceful evolution of Europe because it is economic and not military.Europe is strewn with examples. Russia is the most glaring and the most notorious; but the efforts of France, Italy, and such agrarian countries as Hungary and Poland (to take some typical cases), to industrialise themselves, are all equally the result of political and military promptings. In fact, it may be said that such promptings are impelling more or less every Government in Europe to-day to mobilise &quot; on Government service &quot; the economic potentialities of the country. When Germany dreams of another imperialism, what is in her mind is not necessarily military glory; the wiser of her leaders are thinking in terms of economic imperialism. Germany, deprived by the Peace Treaty of her military weapons, is now busy perfecting her economic arm, so that it may serve her, when the moment comes, as a spearhead of attack in the slow campaign for the peaceful domination of Europe. The French are not altogether wrong in seeing in the proposed Austro-German Customs Union the first move in a new economic hegemony. When France clings to her armaments she is perhaps not thinking only of German militarism; she may also be hoping by this means indirectly to counter-balance the economic predominance of Germany. If Germany is to dominate Europe economically, France will see to it that she herself at any rate continues to dominate the Continent militarily. Such economic argument is no less forceful for not being openly used. In such unavowed ways do economics inpinge on politics. We may observe also what political possibilities lie hidden in Germany&apos;s future economic relationship with Russia, if a time should come for German experience and German efficiency to take part in the running of that vast economic machine which the Bolsheviks are laboriously building up. That, when and if it happens, will be the supreme achievement of the old diplomacy in its cruellest and most ruthless form. The achievement will, moreover, be no less deplorable in that it might be considered in some sort inevitable. Since the days of Peter the Great, Russia has been dependent on Germany for the brains needed to direct and control, and there is insufficient reason anyhow as yet to suppose that the Russia of to-day is any more fundamentally capable of managing her own affairs without assistance.   .,Of all the Great Powers of the world France, despite her recent progress in industrialisation, is still the least susceptible to the inter-play between economic and politics. We sometimes deem her self-centred and narrow,(s) when what we really resent is the fact that she is more materially self-supporting and self-sufficient than most great modern States. This independence enables her to practice pure politics for their own sake, while other Governments have continually to reconcile the divergent claims of national ambitions and economic forces. This gives to her political objectives an uncompromising sharpness and intensity, which is impossible to most other nations. But this self-sufficiency is by no means always a source of strength. It debars the French people from appreciating clearly the world problems of to-day. The combination of detach-ment and uncomfortable proximity to the rest of this modern world is sometimes a source of weakness in their politics. Perhaps this discomfort is at the bottom of France&apos;s continual cry for security, notwithstanding her present military and political predominance.So far we have dealt only with the case where Governments, seeing the potentiality of modern economic forces, use them for their own political and military purposes. There remains still the other form of reaction between politics and economics, where the economic forces dictate the direction of political objectives.   How far is this the case in the world to-day?In the political section of this memorandum I have shown how the present economic depression warped last year the political development of practically(8) There is still too much xenophobia in England directed, mainly and unwisely enough, at the United States and France. For example, alter the German performance at the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission I tried to get into our press some criticism of the German attitude, with an eye to preventing grievances from being all on one side in the future. But these salutary tactics proved quite unworkable; the answer was that the British public had been taught -too long by British statesmen to regard France as the nigger in the woodpile. The reader may well rub his eyes.
every European country, (a) and how the international nervousness of 1930 could be traced to the tension of &quot;hard times,&quot; and the vague semi-Kruschen feeling that it is up to politicians to relieve economic strain by a forward policy. (A forward policy, of course, usually covers a multitude of sins and a few press millionaires.) But apart from this, let us hope passing and reducible, phenomenon there are also more permanent elements in Europe to-day which are forcing politics along well-dehned paths. Competition for raw materials on the one hand, and new markets on the other, is growing keener, while the juxtaposition of congested populations and under-peopled territories is a constant source of friction and of strain. Thus the inability of France and Italy to live on friendly terms in the political sphere is surely in large measure due to the biological fact that France, with a stationary population, is unable to develop her own territories without foreign labour, whereas her neighbour, Italy, with an increasing population, must be ever seeking new outlets for her children, of whom wisdom is not always justified. This impels the latter to roll the concupiscent eye, which keeps her retentive neighbour guessing. What is the good, the economic pessimist may say, of trying politically to reconcile France and Italy on desert frontiers and ships and sealing wax, so long as these fundamental economic antagonisms remain unsolved ?Germany offers another example of a country dirigible by economic forces to a policy of expansion. Her highly developed industrial system seems to require sources of raw material, while her growing population how far it will grow, however, is a question-demands industrial outlets for those talents of perseverance and efficiency which distinguish it. When, therefore, we consider Germany&apos;s itch to re-establish her world position, it would now be a mistake to think that the sole impetus behind this policy is that of revenge, of wounded pride, or the love of military domination. The impulse is largely an economic one, which no German Government could resist if it would. Thus, to give but one instance, it will probably be the economic factor rather than political strategy which in the long run will decide Germany&apos;s attitude towards the &quot;Anschluss.&quot; What better proof of this can I give than the present attempt at an Austro-German Customs Union ? If we look at this move from the political angle, we see it, as I have already pointed out, as the utilisation of economic forces to a definite political end. If we now look at it from the economic angle, we see it as the impact of economic forces on national policy. Both pictures are true and both show the tremendous force of the reactions to-day between economics and politics.There is yet another field where economics may soon be dictating the policy of Governments. The world-wide depression of agriculture we may consider the modern history of wool and wheat, meat, coffee and cotton is encouraging a new defensive grouping in Europe of the agrarian countries and those that have failed to industrialise themselves. It is too soon to say whether this &quot; huddling &quot; will work in favour of international co-operation, or only produce another line of cleavage confusing the already existing political affinities. It is, however, a movement capable of political repercussions and to be watched.It will no doubt be argued that the danger of the national mobilisation of economic forces for political ends and its counterpart the distorting of political ends by economic needs ought to be met at once by international measures of economic disarmament, and by the creation of machinery for ensuring economic co-operation. This is true; but truth and fact sometimes swear at each other. For four years Geneva has been -working on the lines laid down by the Economic Conference of 1927 to achieve at least a first step in economic disarmament and to awaken some slight demand for the outlawry of economic war. M. Colijn, who presided over these labours, has given an account of their history and their, failure. As stated above, it is not cheerful reading. It shows that material results and future prospects are alike jejune. It would appear that other means will have to be sought for solving the problem. Let us hope that the thorough fright that this latest clash between economics and! politics has produced may act as a Avhip to sting the jibbing nations of Europe into another, and this time more successful, attempt at laying aside their economic harness.(*) An exception might be claimed in the tacit agreement of Italy, under financial stress, to avoid mention of her claim for naval parity with France. But, equally, France was tempted to presume too far on her rivaFs poverty and drive Italians, in Mussolini&apos;s phrase, &quot; to eat grass in. order to build ships.&quot;
Till then, man must, &quot; as at present advised,&quot; face the possibility of inter-national struggles developing, either through over-industrialisation, or the unequal control of raw materials, or the maldistribution of populations, to mention only the most obvious danger spots of his habitat. Ways may be found to prevent these struggles; in fact, they must be found, if the ideals of co-operation and disarmament are not to become simply political catchwords, signifying nothing of substance in this materialistic and illusory world. One thing only is certain : It will not be done by applying political cataplasms to economic complaints.4. INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION.The &quot;League of Nations&quot; if it is permissible for an observer and not an attendant to offer any observations at all -is an expression used freely and loosely by people who have not always time to think what they mean by it. This, after all, is the rule and not the exception in our habits. To some&quot; it connotes in a. vague way a bureaucratic organisation, stalled in a one-horse town, encroaching on the legitimate and somewhat mysterious domain of every national Foreign Office, and thereby, in fact, a nuisance or a blessing, according to what is thought, equally vaguely, about Foreign Offices. To others it is a supernational, if not a supernatural, force of which the possibilities are as illimitable as the concept is misty. Actually, it is a quite reasonable attempt to import some kind of coherence into the muddled pattern formed of the different national policies, and a little humanity into inter-governmental dealings. Sometimes the Council or the Assembly is able to conjure up some solid exhibit, which is hailed with delight by the League enthusiasts. At other times nothing seems to come out of the hat, and then there are apt to be doubts whether the League can or will succeed in fulfilling its destiny.Rut lack of achievement may be due to either one of two causes : lack of wrongs or failure to right them. There have been stagnant years at Geneva  reaction after too great an effort such as certainly followed the Geneva Protocol of 1924. Relaxation was said doubtless with some truth to be good for the organism; but that convalescence should have been complete some years ago. Things seem to have been going rather less well lately, and what has the League been doing to put &quot; things &apos;&apos; right ?There is no use in attempting to deny that, during the twelvemonth elapsed between the 1929 and 1930 Assemblies, the League had a lean period. The &quot;League&quot; itself, i.e., the delegates who attend the Assembly, wrere the first, in September last, to confess the fact.That, after all, is one of the advantages of Geneva : the participants do get a pooling of impressions, and the fact that the tone of the last Assembly was anxious shows at least I venture to think that Geneva mirrors pretty well the general state of Europe. If Geneva resounded always to speeches of optimism, it would be as useless as some people would like to believe that it is. On the whole, delegates show a commendable desire to look facts in the face. That is the first requisite for the remedy of uneasy situations, and ordinary humane intercourse between repre-sentatives of the various Governments may sometimes find a way out. In any case the &quot; League of Nations &quot; and now we get to the point is in essence only the sum of uhe individual Governments that constitute it. If the Governments are in reasonable mood, the &quot; League &quot; can do something. If not, it cannot. It might be said, then, by objection, that the &quot; League &quot; is nothing, and that it has done and can do nothing to organise and direct the individual States. The first, and most obvious, answer to this objection is disappointing, if not shocking, to the idealists. It is simply that, if Monsieur A. has Herr B. and Signor C. to dinner even a bad dinner several times a year, the tone of the diplomatic correspondence between those three statesmen (to say nothing of their conversation) undergoes a change. Before the war this curious and general trait was never properly exploited. The further reply whether those who have not attended meetings at Geneva will believe it or not is that some sort of corporate feeling does grow up at Geneva. There is a considerable degree of continuity in the membership of the Council and the Assembly. Quite above and apart from the several national prejudices and antipathies, there is a feeling common to each Council member that he is one of a body of men who have tackled problems together in the past, some-times with success and sometimes with failure. Even on the instinctive level any [5185] f
corporate body of men, if they have been abused and ridiculed by the press for failures and evasions in the past, will be keen to score a success. Moreover and this is a matter of the first importance the Council have built up a regular &quot; technique &apos;&apos; for dealing with difficulties. Now technique is never impressive, and if adjournment seems to the casual observer to play an unduly Important role in their procedure, it is not necessarily a contemptible or ineffective weapon. Some problems of quite respectable gravity are capable of being smothered altogether by &quot;technique,&quot; and it is not certain that some explosions of the past might not have been damped down by tlhese means.The moral of all this if moral there is is that a &quot; bad year &quot; from the point of view of the League does not necessarily mean that the League is failing in its function. If all circumstances conspire to make things uneasy in Europe, the League cannot by a wave of the wand put them right. The League collects and concentrates opinion in the various States. If it did not reflect fairly faithfully that opinion, it would be too far out of touch with life to be able to do any real good. It can sometimes give a bold lead, but that is a risky thing to do. It can sometimes forge ahead of world opinion as in 1924 and do great good to the world and no little harm to itself. These sudden impulses fail of their immediate realisation, of course, and the League suffers discredit for the failure. But their indirect results are greater than is usually realised. Take the Protocol, count up the number of its provisions which were regarded as impracticable, and therefore justifying its rejection, and it will be seen that in the intervening six years there are very few of them that have not been insinuated into the body of international law or at least been accepted in principle by the majority of Governments. This might have happened without the Protocol, but it is extremely doubtful, and it is certain that the process would not have been so rapid.Admittedly, however, during the past year the League has achieved nothing heroic, and even its more practical efforts have been generally nipped in the bud. The Assembly of 1929 dispersed in a noticeable state of exaltation. It had opened with mutual felicitations on The Hague settlement, rendering possible the completion of the evacuation of the Rhineland. That seemed to close the first and most depressing chapter of after-war history. The Pact of Paris had come into force. The prospects of the resumption of negotia-tions on naval armaments gave hope that the League might be able to take up again the difficult but imperative task of disarmament. Finally, the delegation of the United Kingdom Government showed that they were determined on a forward League policy, and in almost every sphere of the Leagued activity they submitted proposals for action. It would be foolish to pretend that all these high hopes were realised. At the risk of being wearisome, it may be worth while enumerating the principal matters with which the 1929 Assembly hoped to make progress, and noting to what extent these hopes were or were not realised.The Protocol for the accession of the United States to the Statute of the Permanent Court, and the Protocol for the Revision of the Statute, are not yet in force. The accession of the United States seems almost as remote as ever. Something was expected of the First Conference on Codification of International Law, which met in March last. Practically nothing resulted. The British delegation tabled proposals for the amendment of the Covenant, to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. Although these wrere examined and elaborated by a League committee in the course of the year, the Assembly last September was unable to adopt any text.The &quot;Tariff Truce Conference&quot; cannot be put on the credit side of the account. The Economic Conference of 1927 had pointed to the dangers and disadvantages of high tariffs and the menace of a tariff war. The members of the League acclaimed this finding and have done nothing except to bury the Tariff Truce in a pauper&apos;s grave. The critic of Geneva may well point to this as the classic instance of tJhe mists of benevolent oratory melting under the hard rays of national individualistic interest. The &quot; tariff truce &apos;&apos; was a British proposal, and in lamenting its death we can at least congratulate ourselves on our courage in fathering it and all that it entailed. That was trying the League rather high. As a gesture, it may yet have some effect; as a practical proposal, who shall say that it has yielded much less than we were entitled to expect ?The British proposal for the negotiation of a &quot; Convention for Strengthening the Means of Preventing War&quot; has so far done little more than bring out rather wide divergences of opinion.    Tlhe proposals
of the British delegation for the reorganisation of the Secretariat, and for giving some better effect to the Slavery Convention, produced some results, but not what was expected of them. Something is being done as a result of the British lead in the matter of combating the drug traffic, but progress is necessarily slow and very difficult. A Conference at the end of 1929 on the Treatment of Foreigners resulted in rather spectacular failure. Almost the only success that can be recorded was the final agreement on the Treaty of Financial Assistance.Consequently, in the twelve months that elapsed between the Assemblies of 1929 and 1930, the actual balance sheet of the League showed a deal on the debit side. If only for that reason, the delegates would have assembled last September in rather a &quot;morning after the night before &quot; mood. But, of course, the general economic depression, Franco-Italian tension, and, on top of all, the results of the German elections, all combined to produce a general atmosphere of apprehension. Looking back at the hopeful features, as they seemed to be, of 1929, there were now, in September 1930, reasons for misgiving about most of them.The German elections seemed to show that the &quot; Briand &apos;&apos; policy in France had been mistaken, and the position of M. Briand himself shaken. The Assembly has failed, so far, to incorporate in its Covenant the principle of the Pact of Paris; this, without necessarily reflecting on the bona fides of the signatories-of the pact, made many wonder why exactly they would not write the pact into the Covenant. The first attempt at economic disarmament has had to be abandoned. The London Treaty, great as was its achievement, was not a hundred per cent, success, and the recalcitrance of France and Italy, boded no good for future disarmament negotiations. In 1929, M. Briand had made a brief and vague insinuation about a &quot; United States of Europe.&quot; It was perhaps disconcerting in 1930 to learn, from the explanation demanded of him, that he was none too clear as to the meaning of that phrase himself. His actual proposals were so tentative and meagre as to emphasise rather the difficulty in the way of a United Europe than the likelihood of its realisation. The high hopes of the 1929 Assembly, which the United Kingdom delegation had done much to raise, had thus, as we have seen, been considerably dashed.In its most important field that of keeper of the peace the League had fortunately been unemployed. It had been enabled to get out of the famous &quot; optants &quot; question. No other dispute of any importance had been referred to it. A cynical observer might say that it was time the League was called upon to settle a really good dispute between almost first-class Powers. It was lucky in 1925 in having the Grasco-Bulgarian dispute to occupy its attention. That was a quite respectable little affray, with all the familiar concomitants of pre-war Balkan outbreaks to give it news value. It was just about adjusted to the growing strength of the League, which managed to handle the matter successfully, and thereby to gain considerable credit. Geneva orators have drawn on it so heavily that it is now practically exhausted. To an observer it seems almost a pity that something new and heavy and soluble cannot devise and present itself.Enough has been said to show why the Assembly of 1930 was necessarily rather gloomy. It is at least to its credit that it did not attempt to blink the facts. And things became uneasier still because, before the end of the year, there came the complaints from the German Government about the treatment of the German minority in Polish Upper Silesia, coupled with veiled threats that Germany, unless she obtained a solution satisfactory to her, would leave the League. This, with an awkward Danzig question being held at arm&apos;s length from the Council, produced an uneasy feeling that Locarno, in settling the western frontier of Germany, had diverted German attention towards the east.Of late an improvement has been produced by two facts, the completion of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference, and the Council action in the matter of the Upper Silesian dispute. The former will, it is being said, let us in for a deal of trouble; but we should have had the trouble ere now without it, and the fact of a more or less agreed decision having been reached shows that the matter is being taken seriously. The latter could be criticised as a typical League &quot; decision,&quot; partaking largely of the na ture of a postponement. It certainly remains to be implemented, but in the meanwhile let us be grateful that the Germans are pleased and that the Poles swallowed the pill with reasonable docility. It may be hoped that the reaction will be favourable enough for the Council, in May, to be able to register an advance in the discharge of its responsibility towards the minority, without further embitterment of the relations between the two principals in this rather jsordid drama.[5185]
It is quite easy to be cynical about the League; but so long as it can be gloomy, as it was last year, there is great hope for it. At least the Assembly is not attended exclusively by irresponsible dreamers. Of course they do have their dreams, and some of them will come true. Progress is seldom achieved without looking ahead, and visions of the future always seem absurd to those who have their noses to the ground. The League would be worth nothing if it did not sometimes attempt the impossible. There are always the Governments in the background to put on the brake. The ideal of to-day is very often the commonplace of to-morrow, and the opponents of the &quot; General Act &quot; are rather inclined to regret the good old days of the optional clause (which they fought tooth and nail at the time). If some people are brave and generous enough to risk ridicule by going ahead of their contemporaries, it is really very good of them, because they rarely get their due when the rest of the world eventually reaps the benefit.CONCLUSION.In 1930, then, it seems that a kind of intellectual depression was produced -and spread to other continents amounting almost to a doubt whether Erectus could really be made upright. A year before the continued existence of &quot; the forces of cultivated prejudice and inherent stupidity&quot; was fully recognised, but there was confidence that a regenerated Europe would soon be able to snap her fingers at their black sincerity. It then became clear that those forces are as yet far from dbne with, and capable of mischief to the new edifice of international peace before the roof is on. Mankind, that outcome of carbon, seems at times to the builders still highly inflammable, and his intelligence to have been developed to the extrusion of instinct, even the instinct of self-preservation. It must be reluctantly admitted that we have not advanced so far or so rapidly as we could wish. The human train of thought is not accelerated by a train going in the opposite direction. There is much thinking and struggling ahead of us, if the old pernicious doctrine of the balance of power is not to creep back. The forces opposed to us are still strong, for it is as true as in the days of Rousseau that &quot; avec un levier suffisant d&apos;un doigt Ton peut ebranler le monde, mais pour le soutenir il faut les epaules d&apos;Hercule.&quot; In 1930 the restlessness of Italy, the determination of Germany to &quot;get back,&quot; the mischief-making of Russia, and French fear of all these elements, showed signs of becoming, quite apart from the economic forces at work, levers sufficiently powerful to shake our new world. If, however, the principles of arbitration, disarmament and co-operation are to sustain it as we wish, then &quot; those in favour &quot; will have to apply the shoulders of Hercules to their labours. Moreover, strength alone is not enough, even if we possessed it, and we are visibly emaciated. Even with recovered weight we shall need both courage and patience, especially the latter, for we are likely to do more harm than good by lecturing, particularly in the case of France, who seems to offer a constant temptation to these methods. She is in fact at once too touchy and too strong to stand them.It is becoming clear, or at any rate more highly probable, that we have another critical period ahead, perhaps the most critical we have ever traversed. It is conceivable that this century may have part in deciding whether civilisa-tion, which began as a life-saving hazard or device, will defeat its own end, or whether the species will live out its vast if limited future. Less impressively, we may hope to avoid the question asked by Mr. Weller of matrimony, &quot; whether it&apos;s worth while going through so much to learn so little.&quot; In recognising this there is no cause for panic : it is in the nature of &quot;the present&quot; to seem uninhabitable, and we need not pay too much heed to the depressionists who pronounce Homo Sapiens at the cross-roads, and shortly to be buried there as a suicide with a stake through his body. If it is a period of transition, what period is not ? And in such periods the old invariably survives by the side of the new. At worst Europe can hate and hold together like many a menage. It is, however, unwise to live on the marches of wrath; for safety we have still to gain time in which the adamite shape of mind may become unnatural to European anatomy, and the protagonists of a living past stand a rank or two deeper among the ghosts; for a great man has hitherto often been one who does something that takes other people a long while to undo. If a crisis can be postponed by timely handling, the present phase might conceivably see the petering out of the old
mettle, since traditional attitudes retain force rather than ardour. During the next ten years or so the old man is likely to be a trial, but he need not be a sentence.Leaving aside for the moment the unexpectedly organised side-show of Herrn Curtius and Schober, the first testing time will be the Disarmament Conference, which may be said to have already begun, although the meeting is fixed for February 1932. Success would, it is believed, definitely set Europe in the right way. Failure, on the other hand, might well set her upon the other path leading back to the jungle of international rivalries and the men of prey. Europe has been asking anxiously and what is said in Europe of course goes further than what is written can success be safely counted upon, especially if Great Britain should comprehensibly feel unable to make any further practical contribution towards that feeling of security which must exist if any real limitation of armament is to be achieved.The more one sees of the psychology and politics of Europe(10) the more seems to depend on England. Mr. Keynes wrote recently on the economic side: &quot; An international cure is essential, and I see the best hope of remedying the inter-national slump in the leadership of Great Britain. But if Great Britain is to resume leadership she must be strong and must be believed to be strong.&quot; There is perhaps nothing new in this. We are all in the same boat, and part of the crew behaves as if it preferred a noyade. The fundamental question that has always confronted humanity or with which it has confronted itself is whether it shall die serially or in blocks. Ever since we first acquired the ability to examine the conditions of our existence, our chief occupation has been the conscious search for the means of safeguarding our lives. But, with an odd lack of savoir mourir, old Adam appears to prefer the block system, in which, to do him justice, he gets himself included. In this so-called 20th century the means to put it into execution are still over-plentiful. It behoves us, then, to be on the watch and to take nothing for granted. It is at least reassuring that there is a growing confidence in the integrity and disinterestedness of the motives of this country, illustrated perhaps particularly in the Balkans. England is pleasingly less liable than before the war to be had for a mug and abused for a Machiavelli. She is now chiefly criticised for loss of tissue, an element indispensable for a hearing from old Adam. In the pursuit of our own views it is therefore necessary to remind ourselves of Sir Walter Raleigh&apos;s phrase that &apos;&apos; whosoever shall follow Truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out his teeth.&quot;How then is Great Britain to make the practical contribution that is expected of her ? Here I think Great Britain can have a concrete policy. It has long been in my mind that eventually nothing short of some form of treaty revision will enable Europe permanently to settle down by consent. The pro-position is as unpalatable to me as to anyone else, but I think one must have the courage to face one&apos;s own previous conviction. I am aware that &quot; mutations are mostly harmful,&quot; and that the most convincing reasons one can find are mostly those for doing nothing. But reason, especially perhaps in France, has always been apt to exclude common sense. Moreover, we cannot cope with dangers without taking risks; and I must risk the charge of prematurity in throwing up such an idea for discussion.For I recognise at once that the idea is premature, although I believe that many minds in France and elsewhere are beginning to work in the same way as my own. (Some are already perhaps clear that 20th-century politics will not use an 18th-century verb : s&apos;enversailler.) For example -a neutral one  &quot; Without the League,&quot; said the Norwegian, Herr Mowinckel, recently, &quot; Europe would not have been able to bear the wrongs inherent in the Treaty of Versailles.&quot; We could, of course, in no circumstances consider treaty revision except within the framework of the League : and, unfortunately, it is just not practical politics to envisage any such programme in time to facilitate disarmament prospects in 1932, on which so much depends.Treaty modification let us in future avoid the word &quot; revision,&quot; for words somehow matter to us is at best but a thing that can come, or be brought about, slowly as we get into the way of peace; and peace, as someone said of happiness at the time of the French Revolution, is, after all, &quot; a new idea in Europe.&quot;  But(10) &quot; From the very nature of his distinctively human attributes, man experiences a difficulty in seeing clearly the things that most clearly affect himself and his own welfare.&quot; Elliot Smith: Human History.
I believe that we should already have it in our minds as an ultimate necessity.. The Disarmament Conference, if it is going to get anywhere, might conceivably have to get to modification at the first stop. We might indeed, if we were unlucky, have the problem in some form thrown upon the council table before we had expected it. It is time therefore that Europe got accustomed to the calm envisagement of the idea. One obviously cannot work towards a thing that is not in one&apos;s mind; and from ours it will with time, that doubtful neutral  make its way in more recalcitrant quarters. The only chance of getting new ideas into the head of Homo Sapiens is to let them percolate, ere it dawns upon him that he may have to act on them. It may well be that, unless we begin to convince ourselves, as prelude to the convincing of others, that the aspect of Europe is not frozen for ever in exactly its present patterns and geography is not everything (&quot;) we can look forward to crises as in 1930 and, again if we are unlucky, 1932-with old Adam not only in the ascendant but threatening to become a political dogstar : to one damned thing after another, in fact, though we may be moderately sure of that anyhow.This long-range policy may be wrong; but if it is right, its obvious and only chance is co-operation with France. Fortunately there are indications that she is generally anxious to co-operate with us. We shall have to get rid of much irritability this memorandum may at least have shown that it is possible to treat foreign affairs with good humour and also some of that spirit of contradiction which is so strong in man. For some years past he has inclined, in this country, toward Germany at the expense of France. It is foolish to be pro-anything especially in considerable, ignorance since it always means being anti-something else; doubly foolish when that something is French and American. We have to be stone-cold in this if we are to avoid the over-secretions of adrenalin so prevalent in Europe. We can proceed only upon the bases, by no means eventually unrealisable, of the consent and self-interest of those concerned. It would be, for instance, wide of the mark to advocate as some do that the Polish Corridor should be abolished because Germans are worth more than Poles. Our data are far too short to assume that one variant of the species is necessarily better than another. It will be time enough to talk of that many centuries hence; and we have got to get there first. For the present all we can contemplate is the gradual inculcation of both anti-Revisionists and Revisionists with the long-range policy. Thus the former would have to be brought to think if not kindly at least resignedly of modification, the latter to think of it with patience and moderation. Everything will depend on how it is put; the formula would have to be something to the effect that the peace treaties are still the basis of everything, but may need eventual modification in various particulars. If Germany has another year like 1930, it may not be possible to put it at all.Besides this distant aim, we must also keep in sight in 1931 some nearer objectives, such as encouraging all forms of Franco-Italian agreement and of Balkan rapprochement, and the remission of that Habsburg question to the League. Furthermore, in 1919 Europe tried to have it both ways. So far as Germany is concerned, it was attempted at once to make the world safe and difficult for democracy. In spite of backslidings such as the manner of presenting the customs union to the other Governments of Europe, the present German Government is as good as we are likely to get. Any change would be, at present, disastrously for the worse. Fortunately it is showing marked signs of making good.   It is in our interest to support it.The issue of the Young plan has happily receded since the New Year; but it may well tend to recur, failing satisfaction elsewhere. On this issue I think we should establish, and keep, some contact with the Government of the United States. Our own informal warnings at the end of last year had a most salutary effect. They may need to be reinforced. This would in no way conflict with the description already given of American policy. It would be a question of words rather than deeds; and such words would be in consonance with the interests, real or imaginary, of the present rather shaky American Administration.&quot;1931 will be a fateful year,&quot; a German statesman has asserted. &quot;In its. course Europe will have to decide whether to advance or fall back.&quot;   Few, IDoes anyone, even in the United States, believe, except on the principle of credo quia. absurdum, that reparations and war debts will run their course?(12) E.g., Poland may in time come to realise that the corridor would be untenable in case of real trouble, and the still more distasteful truth that France neither could nor would afford her any material assistance in such an event. France, I would suggest, is now reasonably covered at home, and has no other plans or possibilities.
othink, will quarrel with this view. And, when all is said in this memorandum, there is some comfort in the original sin of the old Adam. Indeed, if the pursuit of good be better for us than its attainment, there is yet room for positive backslapping. Such doctrines are at least more comfortable than those of our latest anthropologists, who assure us with much proof that dawn-man was a pacifist full of thalamic goodness and that violence is, therefore the product of civilisation. The eventual choice is whether we are to enjoy the benefits of this civilisation, such as it is or can be, without being crushed by it. So much depends upon us, and upon our constant and wakeful realisation of the dualism of the modern world, that I make no apology for the length of this memorandum, &quot; having no time to make it shorter.&quot;ROBERT VANSITTART.

Memorandum respecting the Foreign Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, together with a List of Commitments arising out of that Policy or the Foreign Policyof other Nations.1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION.BROADLY speaking, the foreign policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom has been for the last twelve years :-(a) The final liquidation of political, financial and other problems raised by the war and the peace settlement.(&amp;) The preservation between nations of peace based on security, mutual confidence, the Covenant, and other instruments designed to prevent war and promote equitable settlement of international disputes.(c) The encouragement of efforts to reduce and limit armaments in theinterests alike of security and of economy.(d) The protection of British interests abroad and the development of more friendly and profitable relations with foreign countries.Since the Imperial Conference of 1926 important steps have been taken in promotion of these four aims.(a) The Treaty of Locarno and the admission of Germany to the League of Nations have been followed by the final clearance of the thorny question of reparations and the complete evacuation of the Rhineland by foreign troops. Every endeavour is being made to secure impartial execution of the treaties  to take one important instance, in regard to recent minority disputes in Poland  and to see that the question of treaty revision, if and when it is raised by Germany or other Powers, is dealt with peacefully within the framework of the League and in accordance with international obligations. 5.(b) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, in concert with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions and the Government of India, endeavoured to strengthen the fabric of peace by signing in 1928 the Pact of Paris, whereunder fifty-eight nations have solemnly renounced war as an instrument of national policy and agreed that the settlement of all disputes between the Parties to the Pact shall never be sought except by pacific means. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggested at the 1929 Assembly that the Covenant of the League of Nations be so amended as to harmonise with this complete renunciation, and on the 17th February, 1931, informed the Acting Secretary-General of the League of Nations that, while they had been prepared to accept the amendments to the Covenant proposed by the Expert Committee, they agree that the revised form of these amendments drawn up in September 1930 by the First Committee of the Assembly are an improvement on the former and that they are prepared to support them, though their ratification must depend on the successful conclusion of a Disarmament Convention. They have given their full encouragement and assistance to the preparation of a General Convention for strengthening the means of preventing war and took part in the meeting of a Committee of the Assembly in May to consider the text of this Convention further. At this meeting they proposed an addition to article 3 (proposal B) limiting the field of inspection of the Council&apos;s representatives to what is actually necessary and excluding military, naval and air bases from such investigation. They are prepared to introduce legislation to give effect to this country&apos;s acceptance of the Treaty of Financial Assistance, subject to the successful conclusion of a Disarmament Convention, but first desire to be assured of similar intentions on the part of the Great Powers. Having, on the 10th March, obtained the approval of the House of Commons, they acceded in May, in conjunction with His Majesty&apos;s othter Governments, except His MajestyVi Government in the Union of South Africa, on four conditions, to the[5504] B 2
General Act for the pacific settlement of international disputes. Similar action was taken by the French Government and eight other Governments have acceded to the. General Act. In every way they are seeking to further and fortify the methods of arbitration or conciliation in the case of disputes with foreign States; and, as a tangible proof of their attitude, they have accepted, subject to certain reservations, the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court of International Justice in conformity with paragraph 2 of article 36 (the &quot;Optional Clause&quot;) of the Statute of the Court, binding themselves to the judicial settlement of justiciable disputes. The Optional Clause has also been accepted by the Dominions and India.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have given signal proof of the value they attach to the Permanent Court of International Justice by referring to it several important questions in which they were vitally interested, such as the status of British subjects in Tunisia and the disputed frontier of Iraq. By their signature of the Optional Clause they hope to give further authority and powers of usefulness to the court.(c) The cause of disarmament has hitherto fared less well than that of arbitration and conciliation. France and other European Powers persist in their contention that they have not yet obtained full security, and that the attainment of this end must precede any radical reduction or limitation of armaments. Consequently, the work of the Preparatory Commission, set up in 1926 to draw up a scheme for consideration by a General Disarmament Conference, encountered great difficulties and was only completed at the end of 1930. Only in regard to naval disarmament can any real progress be recorded. Here, indeed, a notable success may be claimed; the ghost of the future, Anglo-American naval rivalry, has been laid, and a satisfactory equilibrium established between the total of the naval forces of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the naval forces of the United States of America and Japan respectively. For the time being the treaty applies mainly to these naval forces only. The mutual suspicions and jealousies of France and Italy are the stumbling-block which must be removed before further progress can be made in regard to naval limitation, and the hope that a settlement had been reached through the good offices of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom has not yet been realised owing to France&apos;s demands. It would be well, indeed, if these incompatible relatives could arrive at an arrangement satisfying the ambitions of the one and the suspicions of the other. Meanwhile, -with lively and imitative neighbours, they continue to increase expenditure on the arms of all elements in a disquieting and mechanically provocative manner.The conclusion of the work of the Preparatory Commission at the end of 1930 has now opened the way for the summoning of the long-awaited Disarmament Conference. The competent Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have already begun detailed work on their proposals for reduction and limitation of the three arms, on the general principle of budgetary limitation. The Council of the League have decided on the 2nd February, 1932, as the date, and Geneva will be the seat, of the Conference. There are, however, formidable difficulties ahead. Many European Powers, notably France, continue to insist on !i security &quot; as the precondition of disarmament; the ex-enemy Powers, on the other hand, insist that the under -takings given at the time of the signature of the peace treaties constitute an unconditional obligation to proceed to measures of disarmament. Above all, the attitude of the Soviet Government may be conclusive for the failure or success of the Disarmament Conference. At meetings of the Preparatory Commission the Soviet delegate stated that his country is ready for complete disarmament if other countries will follow suit, but the neighbours of Russia are not disposed to trust her word. Unless Russia will give at the Disarmament Conference such assurances of her willingness really to disarm as her neighbours consider sufficient, it will clearly be impossible for Poland and Roumania to agree to sensible reductions of armaments, and this, in turn, will react upon the German thesis that the former Allied Powers are under an obligation to disarm down towards the level of the ex-enemy Powers.Under article 8 of the Covenant members of the League have &quot;recognised that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common
action of international obligations &quot; ; and the Council &quot; shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments.&quot; This obligation the German Government will take every opportunity to emphasise.(d) Alike for the advantage of British interests abroad and for the promotion of international commerce and intercourse, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have co-operated in innumerable conferences, congresses, commissions both under the asgis of the League of Nations and independent of it. As a result, numerous conventions, such as that on Freedom of Transit (1921), Navigable Waterways (1921), Simplification of Customs Formalities (1923), the International Regime of Maritime Ports (1923), Slavery (1926), and many others, have been concluded. These have undoubtedly improved communications and advanced the cause of sound economics and better social conditions throughout the world.Less successful have been the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to lower tariff barriers. High protectionist policy is still rampant in Europe and America, and there has been little response to British proposals. An interesting development, however, is the proposal, of which Count Coudenhove-Kalergi is the first begetter and M. Briand the most important exponent, to organise Europe in some sort of federal union. M. Briand&apos;s plan, adumbrated the word for once is proper on the 17th May, 1930, was a suggestion for a European Conference, Permanent Committee and Secretariat, corresponding to, and in connexion with, the similar League bodies, to consider purely European questions. It is, however, possible that ultimately such proposals may raise the question of the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards any such organisation of Europe as would, while reducing internal trade barriers, set up other barriers against the outside world. The Foreign Office are chiefly concerned in so far as economic alliances in the long run are apt to lead to political alliances. Great Britahrs geographical position in Europe and the world-wide nature of the British Commonwealth and of its political and economic relations will make it necessary to consider very carefully the course to be taken toward &quot;pan-European&quot; schemes when, if ever, they materialise. The approval of the Assembly of the League of Nations was obtained in September 1930 to a Commission of Enquiry for European Union being set up in connexion with the League, whose Secretary-General should act in a similar capacity for the Commission. The Commission met in January and again in May 1931. It has devoted itself almost entirely to economic questions, and for that purpose has admitted Soviet Russia, Turkey and Iceland to its discussions. Little has yet been done&quot;, however, except to discuss the difficulties of the East-European agrarian States and their proposals for tariff preferences and a plan for promoting agricultural credits. At the end of March the German and Austrian Governments, under colour of applying M. Briand&apos;s ideas, announced the conclusion between them of a project of a Customs Union a conclusion which was received with great hostility in France and Czechoslovakia. This union, the Germans and Austrians declare, is open to other States to enter. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have adopted an attitude of reserve towards this proposal, as it is considered that, while the Germans and Austrians may or may not be legally entitled to engage in such a union, French agitation over it may well prejudice the prospects of the Disarmament Conference.Our general commitments may therefore be summarised as follows : (i) Membership of the League of Nations.(ii) Acceptance of the Pact of Paris.(hi) Membership of the Permanent Court of International Justice and acceptance of the Optional Clause, binding us, subject to certain reservations, to accept judicial settlement of justiciable disputes.&apos; (iv) Acceptance, subject to certain reservations, of the General Act.To these it is proposed, after consultation with His Majesty&apos;s other Governments, to add : (i) Acceptance of certain amendments to the Covenant harmonising it with the Pact of Paris.(ii) Acceptance of a general convention embodying the draft Model treaty for strengthening the means of preventing war.(iii) Acceptance of the Treaty of Financial Assistance.
Apart from these general there are numerous regional commitments,, foremost of which are (apart from the peace treaties of 1919-23, our special relations with Egypt, the Sudan and Iraq, and the mandates), the Treaty of Locarno, the Four-Power Treaty of Washington of 1921 relating to insular possessions in the Pacific, and our obligations in the Persian Gulf.These will be examined and described under their geographical headings; but, before proceeding to deal with individual countries, which will be treated as far as possible by continents, it will be convenient to consider the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom under the Covenant of the League of Nations.2.-COMMITMENTS UNDER THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OFNATIONS.Articles 10, 11, 13 and 16 of the Covenant provide as follows: Article 10. &quot; The members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League. In case of any such aggression, or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.&quot;Article 11. &quot; Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise, the Secretary-General shall, on the request of any member of the League, forthwith summon a meeting of the CouncilArticle 13 (pledging to arbitration). &quot;In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.&quot;Article 16.^&quot; Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under article 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial, or personal intercourse between the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not.&quot; It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.&quot; The members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the Covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.&quot;The precise obligations involved by article 10 were for some years the subject of discussion. The Canadian Government, taking the view that it created a definite obligation for every member of the League to go to the assistance of any other member whose territorial integrity or political independence was attacked from without, proposed in 1921 that the article should be abrogated. The Assembly of 1921 decided to adjourn the discussion of the question until the next year, and at the Assembly of 1922 the Canadian delegation withdrew the suggestion for the deletion of the article and put forward suggestions for its amendment. The matter was again adjourned by the Assembly, but at a plenary meeting of the Assembly in 1923 the members of the Assembly, with the
exception of Persia, who dissented, and of certain other States, who abstained, voted in favour of the following resolution, defining the extent of the obligation imposed by the article : &quot; The Assembly, desirous of defining the scope of the obligations contained in article 10 of the Covenant so far as regards the points raised by the Canadian delegation, adopts the following resolution : &quot; It is in conformity with the spirit of article 10 that, in the event of the Council considering it to be its duty to recommend the application of military measures&quot; in consequence of an aggression, or danger of aggression, the Council shall be bound to take account, more particularly, of the geographical situation and of the special conditions of each State.&quot; It is for the constitutional authorities of each member to decide, in reference to the obligation of preserving the independence and the integrity of the territory of members, in what degree the member is bound to assure the execution of this obligation by employment of its military forces.&quot; The recommendation made by the Council shall be regarded as being of the highest importance, and shall be taken into consideration by all the members of the League with the desire to execute their engagements in good faith.&quot; ^  ^The representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India voted for this resolution, and it may be taken as indicating the interpretation which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom place upon article 10 so long as that article undergoes no amendment.Article 11 authorises the League to take any action which may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. Action is taken under this article by the adoption and issue by the Council or the Assembly, as the case may he, of recommendations to the States concerned, but it was agreed by the Assembly in 1924 that such recommendations have no binding force and impose no obligations upon a State without its own concurrence.A rticle 13 enables the Council in the event of a failure on the part of a State to carry out an arbitral award to propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto. The rule which renders unanimous decision necessary in the Council ensures that, so long as there is always a British member on the Council, no proposal will be made under this article, to which the British representative feels unable to assent. It must, however, be remembered that the &quot; Committee for the Amendment of the Covenant&quot; have proposed that article 13 be altered so as to provide that the votes of the interested parties shall not be counted.Certain amendments of Article 16 have been adopted by the Assembly, but they have not yet come into force in accordance with the provisions of Article 26. It has also been the subject of lengthy discussions at Geneva in 1921, and a series -of resolutions, on which the draft amendments of that year were founded, were adopted by all the members of the League as embodying the principles on which they would act in case of any application of article 16 before the amendments came into force. The net result of these resolutions of 1921 is briefly that when any case for the appliation of article 16 arises the Council of the League will meet and, so far as is possible, will take charge of the situation. A State which takes no action except in accordance with the recommendations of the Council will run no serious risk of being alleged to have failed to fulfil the obligations under the article.The intention of the article undoubtedly was to impose on members of the League an obligation to sever financial and economic relations with the Covenant-breaking State, and to take in addition military and naval action if the Council thought it expedient. As regards such naval and military measures, it is clear that the particular measures recommended by the Council are not obligatory upon the State concerned; but the fact that it is at liberty to form its own judgment as to the naval and military measures which; it will take, when action is called for, does not entitle it to sit still and do nothing. It is bound to co-operate loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant to such extent as is compatible with its military situation and its geographical position. This was the interpretation of Article 16 given to Germany in October 1925 by the other Powers signatory of the Locarno treaties, viz., Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland.  This interpretation cannot, of course, bind other members of the League.
Mention should also perhaps be made of Article 17 which provides that in the event of a dispute between a member of the League and a non-member State, or between States not members of the League, the non-member State or States shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of the dispute in question; if such invitation is accepted, the provisions of articles 12 to 16 shall be applied subject to any modifications which may be deemed necessary by the Council. If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League and shall resort to war against a member of the League, the provisions of article 16 shall be applicable against the State taking such action. If both parties to the dispute refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute. It will thus be seen that there is a possibility under article 17 that the Council may have to take action; and in so far the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is engaged.Generally speaking, the obligations which the Covenant of the League imposes on His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to take action in support of the Covenant will be confined to measures recommended by the Council. These, consequently, will not be recommended at all without the concurrence of the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government on that body.3. EUROPE. (1) Commitments under the Treaty of Locarno.The settlement reached at Locarno was based on certain principles directly relevant to our commitments under the Covenant of the League : (a) The arrangements made are purely defensive and are supplementary tothe Covenant of the League. (&amp;) They are mutual in character and do not constitute in any sense a unilateral alliance between certain Powers directed against other powers.(c) The obligation undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is limited to the maintenance of the existing territorial arrangements in that area with which their interests are most closely bound up, namely, the frontier between Germany and her western neighbours. His Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed no fresh obligations elsewhere in addition to those devolving on them as signatories of the Covenant.The main instrument in the settlement is the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy. By this treaty the signatory Powers severally and collectively guarantee (a) The territorial status quo resulting from the frontiers between Germanyand Belgium and Germany and France;(b) The inviolability of those frontiers; and(c) The demilitarisation of the Rhineland.The way in which this guarantee operates is as follows : France and Belgium on the one side, and Germany on the other, undertake not to go to war with one another except in self-defence or in circumstances where the Covenant of the League already permits resort to war. The right to go to war which the parties possessed before the Treaty of Locarno is restricted in two ways. The Treaty of Versailles entitled France&apos;to make war on Germany if Germany violated in any way the provisions of articles 42 and 43 of that treaty. The Treaty of Locarno,, on the other hand, limits this right of France to the case of a flagrant breach of article 42 or 43, i.e., to the case where the breach constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression and where immediate action is necessary on account of the assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone. The second restriction concerns paragraph 7 of article 15 of the Covenant of the League. By that paragraph, in the event of a dispute coming before the Council and the Council failing to
agree, the members of the League might take such action as they might think necessary for the maintenance of right and justice. The Treaty of Locarno limited the right of Belgium and France on the one hand, and Germany on the other, to resort to war to cases of self-defence where the other party had first made the attack. It may be noted that this limitation anticipates in the particular sphere of the Locarno treaties the provisions of the Pact of Paris of 1928, which constitute a general ban on resort to war except for purposes of self-defence.As a corollary of this undertaking not to resort to war, France and Germany and Belgium and Germany enter into comprehensive engagements to settle all causes of difference by peaceful means. The technical details of these engagements are contained in separate conventions signed simultaneously with the main Treaty of Locarno.The articles of the main treaty which particularly affect Great Britain are Nos. 4 and 5, which describe the operation of the guarantee. If, without resorting to illegitimate war, France, Belgium or Germany refuse to observe the terms of the arbitration conventions into which they have entered, the matter is brought before the Council of the League, and Great Britain, as one of the guaranteeing Powers, undertakes to adopt whatever steps the Council may propose. Any allegation that France, Belgium or Germany have resorted to illegitimate war against each other is to be brought at once to the notice of the Council. If the Council upholds the allegation, Great Britain is bound to go immediately to the assistance of the Power attacked. Nor is she bound to await the decision of the Council if she herself is satisfied that the allegation is correct and that immediate action is necessary. In the latter case, however, the matter is still not taken out of the hands of the Council. The decision of the Council is merely anticipated, and Great Britain, like the other guarantors, is bound to comply with the Council&apos;s ultimate finding.Our commitments may therefore be summarised as follows : Before the Treaty of Locarno we might have been called upon, both by our membership of the League of Nations and our participation in the Treaty of Versailles (articles 42, 43 and 44), to intervene in any struggle which broke out in the Rhineland.   By the Treaty of Locarno we declare that we will intervene (1) If the Council of the League holds that an attack has been made on Germany by France or Belgium, or on France or Belgium by-Germany, an &quot; attack &quot; in this sense including a violation of the demilitarised zone established by articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.(2) If there occurs an &quot; attack &quot; as under (1) of so flagrant a nature, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are convinced that it constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression, and that by reason either of the crossing of the frontier or of the outbreak of hostilities or of the assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone immediate action is necessary.(3) If the Council of the League decides that warlike measures are necessary to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision given under the arbitration treaties between Germany and Belgium or Germany and France.Two further points may be noted : (a) No obligation was imposed by the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee upon, any of the Dominions, or upon India, unless the Government of such Dominion, or of India, should signify its acceptance thereof. The question was considered at the Imperial Conference of 1926, when it, was made clear that it was not contemplated by any of the Dominions to take upon themselves the additional obligation. At the same time the conference adopted a unanimous resolution to the effect that it. &quot; has heard with satisfaction the statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to the efforts made to ensure peace in Europe, culminating in the agreements of Locarno; and congratulates His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain on its share in this successful contribution towards the promotion of the. peace of the world.&quot; [5504] c
(&amp;) Our special commitments under that treaty are terminable one year after the Council of the League, acting&apos;on a request of one or several of the high contracting parties notified to the other signatory Powers three months in advance, and voting at least by a two-thirds majority, decides that the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection to the high contracting parties.In conclusion, attention may be drawn to the following note by the late Sir James Headlam-Morley when Historical Adviser at the Foreign Office : &quot;If any British Government, after full and mature consideration, after debate in Parliament and general public discussion, feel themselves authorised to become parties to a treaty of guarantee and to make the maintenance of this a permanent part of British policy; if this is publicly proclaimed; if in presenting the estimates for naval and military defence the importance of providing for liabilities under this treaty is shown; then I believe that in the long run the treaty will become effective.&quot;That is to say, the more the nations of Europe become convinced of our readiness to fulfil our guarantee, the less likelihood will there be that we shall be called upon to do so.(2) France.The policy of France in Europe in the years immediately following the war was governed predominantly by her desire to obtain &quot; security &quot; full enough to&apos; satisfy her that she need fear no future aggression on the part of Germany. The Locarno agreements, indeed, introduced into the relations between the two countries the seeds of the policy of compromise and arbitration, and since then France has built up a network of treaties of mutual guarantee and compulsory arbitration, and has followed up her signature of the Pact of Paris, of which she claimed a share of parenthood, by acceptance of the Optional Clause and General Act. -She has also supported the amendment of the Covenant, the Treaty of Financial Assistance and the draft Model Treaty for Strengthening the Means of Preventing War, and she has noAv obtained, or will soon have obtained, through these various instruments the greater part of the &quot; security &quot; which she sought under the 1924 Protocol.But, at the same time, succeeding French Governments have continued to put their chief trust in the strength and efficiency of their armament. Though easily the strongest. military and air Power in Europe, France continually increases her expenditure on these arms. Recent experience shows her reluctance to bind herself to any drastic naval limitation. She has gone ahead with the fortification of her eastern frontiers, and has pressed on the development of the resources of raw material and population contained in her North African possessions, where she aims at calling a new empire into being to redress the balance of population in Europe. This policy makes it essential for France to safeguard her communications in the Mediterranean, and so brings her into acute rivalry with Italy.These preparations for defence France seems unlikely to agree to reduce, until the new arbitration treaties have become definitely operative and compre-hensive in their effect and the treaties of guarantee signed since the war have been supported by what France considers adequate safeguards. Just as France is unwilling to consider a general tariff disarmament before her own industry and agriculture are sufficiently protected by international agreements regarding production, so she is unwilling effectively to disarm her forces before political - security has been organised by practical guarantees against the clanger of war.Recent events have unfortunately tended to convince French Governments of the wisdom of this attitude. The clamour which arose in Germany during the summer of 1930 for a revision of the financial settlement was accompanied by a growing resentment in ex-enemy countries at the frontiers assigned to them in the political settlement. The immense popularity of the National Socialist programme at the elections in 1930 was evidence of this discontent. The Stahlhelm parade showed that the militaristic spirit was still alive in Germany, the speeches of Signor Mussolini revealed the sympathy which the revisionist
cause had won in Italy. A wave of alarm passed over France; M. Briand&apos;,s policy of conciliation, of seeking security by compromise and arbitration was criticised; and to the pressure which was put upon them to adopt a conciliatory attitude in questions of disarmament the French Government replied with requests for further guarantees of security, for more certain proof that His Majesty&apos;s Government are both willing and able to implement all the under-takings they have given in signing the Covenant of the League, the Locarno Treaty and the Kellogg Pact.Then in the spring of 1931 the German proposals for a customs union with Austria were sprung upon a suspicious France. The vague nightmare of the &quot; Anschluss &quot; at once assumed the appearance of a pressing danger, and fears that a new alliance would arise in Central Europe so reacted on the French political world that, in spite of the large majorities given in favour of the foreign policy of which he had for so long been the instrument, clear expression was given in the Presidential election on the 13th May to the feeling that M. Briand himself no longer possessed the confidence of the nation.With Great Britain, however, there are no major questions in dispute. The joint administration of the New Hebrides will, so long.as it is maintained, continue to involve the two Governments in sotto voce argument. The hardships caused to British bondholders of French rentes by the stabilisation of the franc have called forth complaints to which it has proved impossible to induce the French Government to turn a friendly ear, and the French desire to tighten up all sources of revenue and to prevent foreign firms from obtaining control of French companies has resulted in some grossly unfair demands for income tax being made on British companies operating in France. Generally speaking, it is to the interest of England to see a strong and prosperous France, just as it is to the interest of France to retain the friendship of this country. Thus, in spite of the differences of opinion which will undoubtedly continue to arise between the two countries, their Governments will be obliged to co-operate in the settle-ment of post-war problems. It is to be hoped (difficult though it may be) that in the course of time means will be found without involving His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in commitments which they would not feel, justified in accepting, to give France a feeling of security sufficiently strong to lead her to withdraw from the unbending position hitherto adopted by her in the matter of disarmament. It is possible that the elections of 1932 will give-a majority to the Left parties in the Chamber; if so, the future may see modifica-tions in the internal policy pursued by recent Governments, but it is difficult to believe that any Government will abandon a foreign policy of which the principal object has always been to safeguard the security of France.(3) Germany.The commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in regard to Germany, over and above the obligations of the Covenant, are determined by0the Treaty of Locarno and have been defined in the previous paragraphs of this memorandum. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no other formal commitments in regard to Germany; but, despite the progress of general appeasement and pacification, Germany is bound to remain for many years so much the pivotal point of European politics, that a consideration of her position is particularly important.The situation at present is governed by The Hague agreements of January last, which constitute a final settlement of German reparation, and have been rather optimistically referred to as the &quot; liquidation of the war.&quot; The so-called &quot; Dawes Agreement &quot; of 1925 had fixed the annuities payable by Germany for a certain number of years, but had not attempted to determine the eventual total, and the enormous figure fixed by the Reparation Commission in 1921 remained theoreticallv unaffected. Although Germany continued! to meet her obligations under the Dawes Agreement without undue difficulty, owing mainly to large sums borrowed from the European and still more the American investing public, the indeterminate position was admittedly unsatisfactory. Germany was anxious both to have her obligations defined and to secure the relaxation or removal of the financial controls set up by the Dawes scheme. The American Agent-General for Reparation Payments at Berlin took a similar view, and in September 1928 [5504] c 2
an agreement was reached setting up a committee of financial experts to effect &quot;a complete and definite settlement of the reparation problem.&quot;This Committee of Experts met in Paris from February to June 1929 under the presidency of Mr. Owen Young, and fathered the &quot;Plan &quot; which bears his name. Thereunder the total obligations of Germany were laid down in a series of annuities spread over fifty-nine years, the payments for the last twenty-two years representing only the amounts necessary to cover the debts due from the Allied Governments to the United States. After two international conferences at The Hague in August 1929 and January 1930, respectively, the Young Plan was embodied in the formal agreement of the 20th January. The ratifications of Germany and the principal creditor Powers were exchanged in Paris on the 9th May. One important result of the new agreements is to enable some part of the reparation debt of Germany to be placed on a commercial footing; and a jmblic issue of German bonds to the value of  60 million sterling (of which  40 million are on reparation account) has been made. Thus begins the policy of &quot;mobilisation &quot; of the German reparation debt, a matter to which the French Government have attached particular importance. The result is important in so far as it tends to remove the reparation question from the political to the purely financial and commercial sphere.Germany&apos;s acceptance of the Young Plan was conditional upon the immediate and final evacuation of the Rhineland, although under the Treaty of Versailles the Third Zone was not to be evacuated until January 1935. In August 1929 it was agreed at The Hague that the British and Belgian troops should leave before the end of the year (this was duly clone) and the French troops within a period of eight months from the bringing into force of the Young Plan, or not later than the 30th June, 1930. The unexpected delays in setting afoot the plan cast some doubt upon the application of this last provision, but the evacuation was completed as originally intended by the 30th June.This being accomplished the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles for the demilitarisation of the zone defined in article 42, are no longer controlled by the armies of occupation, but depend for observance on the word of Germany, and the supervision of the League of Nations under article 213. It is to be noted that by article 44 Germany recognises that any violation of the obligations imposed upon her by articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles in regard to the demilitarisation of the Rhineland shall be regarded as constituting a hostile act against the Powers signatory of the present treaty, including Great Britain.In addition to the League&apos;s right of supervision the French Government pressed for a special body to control the demilitarisation and to examine any allegations that the treaty was not being observed. This demand was stubbornly urged by the French and as stubbornly resisted by the Germans, who were able to point out that the treaty had made no provision for the establishment of such a committee. After protracted discussions it was agreed at The Hague in August that any French or Belgian allegation of non-observance should be referred in the first instance to the Franco-German or Belgo-German Arbitration Commission set up at Locarno. This agreement was a victory for Germany, and deprives the demilitarisation clauses of any but the general safeguards already mentioned.The settlement of German reparations and the evacuation of the Rhineland constitute a &quot; liquidation of the war &quot; among the Western Powers, except in one comparatively minor point. The Saar Territory is still administered by a governing commission appointed by the League of Nations, and, under the treaty, a plebiscite must be held there in 1935 to determine its ultimate fate. At the time of the first Hague Conference the German Government made strenuous efforts to place the question on the agenda, with a view to regaining immediate possession. The French Government successfully resisted this proposal, but agreed to negotiate privately with Gerrtiany on the subject. Intermittent negotiations proceeded in Paris for a time, but proved fruitless. The root of the matter is that the plebiscite will undoubtedly result, except perhaps in the case of one small district, in an overwhelming majority for the return of the Saar Territory to Germany. The French Government desire various economic con-cessions, particularly a share in the administration of the mines, in return for which they would agree to immediate retrocession. Germany, on the other hand, is not prepared to buy dearly what must fall to her Avithout price. Between these appetites there is for the moment small chance of composition; but both sides
have an interest in avoiding the cost and ill-feeling of a plebiscite. An amicable settlement may thus be reached between now and 1935, thus leaving no outstanding questions on Germany &apos;s western frontier.This, however, unfortunately does not mean that Germany will then be prepared to accept the status quo resulting from the Treaty of Versailles as final and satisfactory. Indeed, it may be anticipated that the settlement of the immediate problems of reparations and evacuation will turn her thoughts to other issues, hitherto in the background, but henceforth more definitely emergent mto national consciousness.  Of these the principal are : (a) The modification of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier.(b) General disarmament or, failing that, the rearmament of Germany toobtain at least parity with Poland.(c) The re-establishment of Germany as a World Power, i.e., the acquisitionof colonies or mandates.(d) The &quot; Anschluss &quot; with Austria,In regard to (a), relations between Germany and Poland continue to be affected by an undercurrent of hostility, and it would be erroneous to suppose that Germany has become in any way reconciled to her present eastern frontiers. An agreement has been signed with Poland for the settlement of property claims as well as a commercial treaty, and the former has been ratified. These agreements, however, both met with considerable opposition in Germany, not so much on their own merits as because the conclusion of any agreement with Poland was regarded, at any rate by the Nationalists, as a sort of tacit recognition of the status quo. The economic crisis in East Prussia, which appears to be due primarily to general agricultural conditions and not to the isolated territorial position of East Prussia, has been freely used to prove the iniquity of the Polish Corridor. Tfie feeling on the subject of the Corridor would appear for the moment to be even stronger than feeling in Upper Silesia, though the strength, of both can hardly be exaggerated. The modification of the eastern frontiers remains the cardinal objective of German policy though now replaced again by reparations and the only doubt is how soon the German Government may think it expedient to place the question in the forefront of their programme.In regard to (b), the Treaty of Versailles, with the correspondence between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and the German dele-gation at the time of its signature, implied that the disarmament of Germany was only the first instalment of general disarmament, which it was hoped to achieve through the League of Nations. Germany, at Geneva, has lost no opportunity of draAving attention to this fact, and the failure to achieve any measure of general disarmament has undoubtedly strengthened the feeling in Germany that the relevant clauses of the Treaty of Versailles have lost their moral sanction. There is no doubt that, in default of some general disarmament, the rearmament of Germany, at least up to parity with Poland, will become a, definite object of German policy.There has been much recent agitation in Germany concerning naval construction. Germany is entitled to replace her six old crusiers by new vessels within the tonnage limit laid doAvn by the Treaty of Versailles. One nevv vessel building has aroused considerable interest and some apprehension abroad; for although its tonnage does not exceed the treaty limit (10,000 tons), it is alleged, owing to the employment of neAv constructional devices, to be equal in fighting poAver to battleships of far greater tonnage. The construction of a second cruiser is in contemplation. These treaty constructions Avould not make Germany a naval PoAver of importance from the standpoint of Western Europe; but the objective constantly in the German mind, i.e., to make Germany the strongest naval Power in the Baltic, might Avell heave in sight.In regard to (c), it may be said that propaganda is still occasionally heard in Germany for the acquisition of colonies or mandates. There is, of course, a general desire on the part of Germany to regain her pre-Avar position as a world Power, but no great concrete ambition to reacquire an OArerseas Empire. It seems unlikely that Germany aauII in the near future risk the determined opposition of the Western PoAvers, and particularly of Great Britain, by pressing any latent ambitions for colonial expansion.The &quot; Anschluss &quot; question has absorbed public attention to the exclusion of every other topic connected Avith Germany since the German and Austrian
Governments published an agreement between themselves to negotiate a customs union. It is impossible at the time of writing to prophesy what the outcome of this departure will be or what modifications it will bring about in the relations of Germany with her neighbours. The following propositions may, however, be stated with some confidence : The initiative came from Germany, not Austria. No political union of the two countries was contemplated, but it was recognised on all hands that the existence of a customs union would greatly facilitate, if not render inevitable, an eventual political union. The German move w7as inspired, among other things, by a desire to show that they were capable of taking a decided initiative in foreign policy. The conclusion of the Treaty of Rapallo with Russia in 1922 offers the only parallel, since the end of the war. In both cases German action was marked by a disregard for the susceptibilities of foreign countries, which aroused universal perturbation. The German proposal may rightly be regarded as a first step towards increasing German influence in the central and south-eastern European States, inviting as it does consideration of an economic nexus between her highly industrialised territories and these less advanced countries. Comment in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Roumania and Hungary has, in fact, shown a general appreciation of the fact that economic interests tend to link Germany with these nations and to run counter to the political affiliation of the first three with France. Political allegiance to France may, however, be expected to stand the strain, and the opposition of France to the German scheme has been unqualified and unanimous. The legality of the German plan is in doubt, but even if it were recognised, the political tension would be unresolved. In these circumstances a strong desire has been manifested in every country excepting Germany, but including Austria, that some deus ex machind will appear &quot;with a plan which will alleviate the economic difficulties arising out of the territorial settlement of 1919 and the nationalistic sentiments of the the succession States, and at the same time satisfy whatever legitimate difficulties have been pleaded by Germany in justification of her preliminary agreement with Austria. No practicable plan of this kind has yet been discovered and no other expedient suggested for obviating a growing antagonism between French and German policy. His Majesty&apos;s Government have used their influence with a view to subjecting the whole position to thorough and prolonged examination and discussion. Their objects are first to keep the peace, and, secondly, to preserve intact the/most-favoured-nation and other rights under which British trade with the continent of Europe is carried on.Relations between Germany and Italy are for the present unimportant. There have been signs that Italy would look with favour on a closer connexion with Germany and that, in the Italian view, common jealousy of France and a desire to modify the Treaty of Versailles might provide a basis for durable friendship. There is, however, little sign that this view is at all widely shared in Germany. Dislike of Signor Mussolini and his methods, contempt for Italian political achievements, and memories of the fate of the Triple Alliance, all combine to render any close collaboration with Italy distasteful to German opinion as a whole. Moreover, the encouragement given by Italian Fascists, apparently not without the approval of Signor Mussolini and the Italian Embassy at Berlin, to the Nationalists and the National Socialists is not likely in the long run to make Italy popular in German political circles. It may be said that, in the case of Italy as in the case of France, Germany has been the recipient of . advances more assiduous of course in the former than in the latter case- to which she shows at. present no great response. Courtship by two parties is of course a strong position, so long as she does not compromise herself with either; and she appreciates the present value of virtue. On the French side, however, this half-hearted process has now7 cooled off again into suspicion and irritation.Germany and the Soviet Union are not getting on so well this year. The Soviet Union seem to have started a general campaign against German concessions and other German commercial interests in the Union, which has provoked not unnatural irritation. But the cause of the cooling lies deeper. In the years immediately following the war many German hands sought in the east a card to play against the policy of the ex-Allies in the wrest. This policy culminated in the Treaty of Rapallo; and the balance between east and west remained for several years a guiding factor in German foreign policy. The gradual success of the western policy, inaugurated by Herr Stresemann, has had the natural result of making German friendship with the Soviet Union at once less necessary and-
less practicable. The Hague Agreements, the so-called &quot;liquidation of the War,&quot; and even somewhat improved relations with Poland are, of course, distasteful to the Soviet authorities, for so long as Germany stands well with the Western Powers she is like to be &quot;very distant and well-bred &quot; with the Soviets; but Germany&apos;s relations with the Soviet Union are correct, if not cordial, and it is a main principle of German policy that they should remain so. She is still apt to reinsure in the East.(4) Italy.Generally speaking, Great Britain and Italy have been on friendly terms since the consolidation of the Italian Kingdom in the last quarter of the 19th century. To-day the likelihood of this country being drawn into hostility with Italy, save in virtue of our obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations, is, as heretofore, remote.. Nevertheless, the foreign policy of Italy is, if not actually aggressive, at least restless and ambitious, and constitutes a disturbing element in Europe.   This is due to three main causes : (1) The continued increase of Italian population, for which an outlet mustbe found Italy&apos;s chief problem. (2) The desire for &quot;prestige,&quot; characteristic of Powers which have just&quot; come of age,&quot; and due in part to the personal nature of the Duce&apos;sGovernment.(3) Jealousy of France, and a determination, if possible, to play a more important role than hitherto in Central Europe and the Balkans.Although the chief outlet of former Italian emigration, the United States of America, is now largely closed, France takes many Italian emigrants, and compact colonies of these are being formed in,her south and south-eastern Departments. But Fascist policy, while commending and, indeed, stimulating the natural fertility of the Italian people, discourages emigration to foreign countries. It aims rather at settling the immediate human increase in those homelands where reclamation is being energetically undertaken, and at acquiring eventual colonies or mandated territories where multiplied men could be accommodated when readjustment comes to pass; for Versailles seems to have made too many treaties to make finality.The will to power of modern Italy cannot be exactly defined or its consequences approximately predicted. It is a psychological one had almost said a pathological condition, but none the less important and all the more intractable. It may be compared with the pre-war spirit of the German Government. It is manifested in the Duce&apos;s flowers of speech and fruits of temper, and in the changing nature of the objectives on which he focuses the thoughts, or rather the emotions, of his adherents. It thrives upon fancied slights and neglects, and will yield, if at all, only to some humouring and consideration.It is this consideration which Italy, rightly or wrongly, conceives to be withheld by France, and it is neglect or contempt which Italy, rightly or wrongly, apprehends in French sentiment towards herself. Such apprehensions operate directly to poison relations between Italy and. France. Indirectly they minister to the antagonism between Yugoslavia and Italy, and impede disarmament on sea and land.With a view of improving the general atmosphere surrounding Franco-Italian relations, spasmodic negotiations have been proceeding for the last three years, largely at the instance of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. The object has been to remove certain grievances which Italy has against France with regard to the Italian population in Tunis and the frontiers between Libya and the French Sahara,, and to crown the settlement by the conclusion of a general treaty of arbitration and conciliation. These negotia-tions, however, produced no result, and after the summer of 1929 they had tacitly lapsed.   An effort is now being made to revive them.Unfortunately, as explained above, the disagreements between France and Italy are based on a fundamental antagonism, only to be conjured when public opinion in both countries realises that a new spirit is necessary in the common interest. Meanwhile, this friction is bound to constitute one of the most important and at the same time one of the most disconcerting elements in the life of present-day Europe. In face of this problem, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is to take every opportunity of facilitating\
discussions between Italy and France, without, however, assuming the role of mediator, still less of arbitrator.It must be confessed that during the three months of difficult negotiation, culminating in the London Naval Treaty, the heats between France and Italy, far from being allayed, were, if anything, intensified. Direct conversations between the delegations of these two Powers led to no solution of the deadlock in regard to &quot;parity.&quot; It eventually became apparent that more time would be required for the picking of this old bone of contention than could be given at the end of a conference already three months long. There appeared to be some realisation on both sides that things could not be left where they were, and the two Governments agreed to continue their negotiations after the adjournment of the conference. These have now dragged on for well over a year without any definite result; and in the event of failure Franco-Italian relations would undergo a further deterioration, which in turn would react adversely upon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to promote disarmament.The next most important Italian problem is that of relations with Yugoslavia. Ever since the creation of that Kingdom, Italy has adopted a. consistently hostile attitude towards it, and, although in course of time various concrete causes of friction have been removed, the acrimony has not appreciably lessened. Italy has two main grievances against Yugoslavia : (1) That she is a French satellite, and that, by her alliance with France, she is &quot; encircling &quot; Italy; and (2) that she threatens the independence of Albania and Italy&apos;s position in the Adriatic and the Balkans. To obviate these clangers she has established a practical protectorate over Albania, and thus ended any ideas that the Yugoslav Government may originally have had of absorbing Albania. At the same time, in order still further to threaten Yugoslavia on her flanks, she has concluded agreements with Hungary and Greece, and has surreptitiously encouraged the^ Macedonian revolutionaries, thus keeping alive the feud which prevents normal relations between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.Italy has intimated that if Yugoslavia were to abandon her close connexion with France she would change her policy towards Yugoslavia. It may, therefore, be said that strained relations between Italy and Yugoslavia are but another symptom of the fundamental antagonism between France and Italy.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have endeavoured throughout, both at Eome and Belgrade, to help the two countries to find the basis for a modus vivendi. Faint indications have recently been observed on both sides of the Adriatic that, after many disappointments, this policy may perhaps bear fruit, though how far it will ripen is another matter. So long as the fathers eat sour grapes the children&apos;s teeth will be set on edge. There might be less acidity if Yugoslavia were to abandon or attenuate the French connexion, but of such a portent there is no present sign, nor, indeed, any visible probability.Apart from general obligations under the Covenant of the League, the only obligation of Great Britain which is affected by the policy of Italy, as described in the foregoing section, is that resulting from a resolution adopted by the Ambassadors&apos; Conference in respect of Albania on the 9th November, 1921. The Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan then agreed that, in the event of Albania being unable to maintain her integrity and appealing to the Council for foreign assistance, they would instruct their representatives to recommend that the restoration of the frontiers of Albania be entrusted to Italy; similarly, in the event of a threat against her territorial or economic independence as a result of foreign aggression or any other event, the said Governments would, if Albania did not have recourse to the League, themselves raise the question at Geneva, and again instruct their representatives to entrust Italy with the restoration of the frontiers were such action necessary. Great Britain agreed to this resolution because Italy refused to consent to the definition of the Albanian frontiers until some form of recognition had been given to what she regarded as her special interests. The resolution finally signed represents an appreciable whittling down of the original proposals.(5) Austria.The relations of Great Britain with Austria are not subject to any special engagements, and are normal and friendly.
At the time of Austria&apos;s economic collapse after the war, Great Britain was foremost in helping to restore her finances and to set the Austrian State on its feet. It has been the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to afford Austria all possible assistance toward the development of her resources as a self-supporting State, and the recovery of that national self-confidence which will enable her to take her proper place in Europe. This policy received a considerable contribution when The Hague Agreements removed the last remaining obligations imposed on Austria for the payment of reparations.Observations on the proposed customs union between Germany and Austria will be found in the section of this paper devoted to Germany. The legality of such a union is a matter of doubt and depends mainly upon the interpretation of Protocol No. 1 of October 1922; whether in fact it would entail the grant to Germany by Austria of a special regime or exclusive advantages which violate, or are calculated to violate, the economic independence of Austria. The proposal to enter into a customs union with Germany has not so ,f ar affected the foreign relations of Austria. She is regarded, and.indeed may almost be said to regard herself, as the corpus vile upon which a German experiment is being conducted. She has allowed it to be seen that she is hardly in a position to resist advances from her powerful neighbour, but that she is already uneasy as to the consequences of the German scheme, and might be ready to run out of it for an adequate consideration.(6) Hungary.Hungary, rather than Austria, is the residuary legatee of the political,, constitutional and social ideas which made the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Government what it was. As such she is viewed by her neighbours with a jealous and hostile suspicion. Hungary, for her part, makes no secret of her wish to see amended the treaties which deprived her of more than half her territory and population, but she is neither able nor probably anxious to promote such a change by other than peaceful means.The Little Entente exists primarily to resist alteration of the Treaty of Trianon. They will for some years no doubt be successful in doing so, but the instability of the peace settlement in regard to Hungary is a continuing fact, which cannot be ignored. The frontiers as drawn by the Treaty of Trianon constitute a real grievance, especially the frontier with Roumania, inasmuch as,, apart from the affront which they offer to the national pride of the former dominant race, they represent the subjection of 3 million Hungarians to foreign rule. It is the trouble of diffused and race-conscious man that no map-making can sort him out to the satisfaction of &quot;tout le monde et son pere.&quot; Mutual bitterness is still further increased by the contemptuous under-doggedness with which the Hungarians vieAv their so-called conquerors, particularly the Roumanians, and by the fact that the &quot;King question&quot; remains a problem capable of precipitating a crisis whenever an attempt is made to solve it. The Little Entente is pledged to prevent the Habsburg restoration, and the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, for the sake of peace, compelled the Hungarian Government in 1921 to declare the House of Habsburg as excluded from the throne. To this act of pressure His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were a party, and to that extent they are committed to support the Little Entente in preventing a Habsburg restoration. For the present, probably not for very long, the Hungarian Government are prepared to allow the &quot; King-question &apos;&apos; to remain dormant. There is a possibility, though little real prospect, that it may eventually be solved by the creation of a non-Habsburg monarch.Meanwhile, in one respect, there has been an improvement in the relations between Hungary and her neighbours. The Hague settlement, recently com-pleted in Paris, has removed the long-drawn friction created by the wholesale confiscation of Hungarian landed property in ceded territories, more particularly Roumania.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no special interests in Hungary. This country is liked and respected by the Hungarian people. Such liking and respect would be more warmly reciprocated if the Hungarian Government could bring its constitutional and administrative system into harmony with the more democratic institutions of Austria and Czechoslovakia.
In general, it may be said that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom seeks to impress upon Hungary and her neighbours that the road to stability is by way of acceptance of the new world created by the genesis of the Peace Treaty, by mutual arrangements for political conciliation, and by the substitution of economic co-operation for the system of tariff barriers so detrimental to the economic unity of the Danube Basin, more particularly to Austria and Hungary.(7) The Balkans.Before the war conditions in Europe were such that any bonfire south of the Danube led easily to a European conflagration. When the League of Nations intervened in the dangerous Graaco-Bulgarian dispute of October 1925 the machinery set up by the Covenant was shown to be powerful enough to localise, if not to terminate, a clash between two simply Balkan States. So far, so good; but just so far as such simplicities enter into a wider system are greater Powers exposed to the disquiets inherent in contact with impulsive, inexperienced and relatively outrageous Administrations, and with lands that have but recently blossomed into independence in the warm atmosphere of all uncharitablenessNow, as a result of the peace settlement, Yugoslavia, Roumania and, to a less extent, Greece are no longer purely self-contained Balkan States. They share in the general responsibilities of the rest of Europe, and have a direct interest in the discussion and settlement of problems affecting Europe as a Avhole. Perforce, however, they largely and regrettably retain the mentality of the small pre-war Balkan States. Still borne by the cross-currents of distaste, they have not yet acquired the European outlook which they need to be in the same street as their neighbours(a) Albania.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no direct commit-ments towards the Albanian Government, but they are a party to the resolution described under the Italian section of this memorandum. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment hold, and have stated to the Italian Government, that the position of Italy in respect of Albania, owing to geographical and economic considerations, must necessarily be of a very special kind, but that the resolution cannot be interpreted as conferring upon any Power any exclusive right of influence or intervention in normal times as apart from those special circumstances of foreign invasion or other event involving a threat to Albanian integrity.Much importance is attached by the Italian Government to this resolution of the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, but the Yugoslav Government have never acquiesced and never will acquiesce in it. It is the stumbling-block in the way of progress towards better relations between the countries. His Majesty&apos;s Government, taking no special interest on their own account in Albanian internal affairs, would prefer to be free of an undertaking which was originally intended to meet a particular crisis rather than to become a permanent part of the public law of Europe, but no opportunity for getting rid of their commitment to Italy has yet presented itself.(b) Bulgaria.In Bulgaria the Government is weak, the administration corrupt, the people backward and despondent, the financial position well-nigh hopeless. This endemic condition His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom might have been content to leave to the compounded virtues of time and the Bulgarians them-selves, were it not that the geographical and historical position of Bulgaria is such that the strength or weakness of its Government belongs to the peace of the Balkans generally. More particularly owing to the limpness of that Govern-ment does the Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation use Bulgarian territory as the spring-board for its murderous antics in Serb-Macedonia. These activities, which are not discouraged by Italy, flare up periodically into crises involving the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Governments. The Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation aims at creating, by incursion and bloodshed, a
situation in Southern Serbia such that world opinion will be forced to admit a change of the frontiers laid down by the Peace Treaty, and compel Yugoslavia to disgorge the province to Bulgaria. The power of the organisation is formidable, and it exercises an ancient political intimidation. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have endeavoured to put heart into the Bulgarian Government to the extent that, even if they cannot suppress the organisation, they should at least endeavour to control its activities and thereby enable friendly relations to be established between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Government have warned the Yugoslav Government that they would do well to improve their local administration in Southern Serbia, which is still no better than it has been, and thus affords a happy hunting-ground for Macedonian men of prey to exploit the grievances of the local population. These representations have had a certain effect. Negotiations were opened last year between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at Pirot, and resulted in an agreement which settles various frontier questions and provides for a Mixed Commission to investigate all frontier incidents. The Macedonian Revolutionary Organisa-tion has, therefore, recently organised further outrages for the purpose of bringing this to none effect. His Majesty&apos;s Government have renewed their advice at Sofia, and the Bulgarian Government seem at last to have realised that, in their own interests, the time has arrived for them to come to grips with the Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation. How wide is the gap between knowing and doing remains to be seen. If there is no more than a few wriggles, and the Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation continues its terrorism, Yugo-slavia may some day lose patience and take the law into her own hands by-invading Bulgarian territory, or else appeal to the League under article 12 of the Covenant, content to proceed to hostilities at the end of the statutory nine months, in the probable event of the Council not having found in the interval the solution of the Macedonian problem for which Europe has been searching for the last thirty years. In the absence of such an acute crisis, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by inviting the League, under article 11 of the Covenant, to take up the thankless task of finding a solution of the persistent Macedonian problem; nor, indeed, would the. suggestion be welcome to other Powers.(c) Greece.Since the new advent of M. Veniselos in the summer of 1928, Greece has: enjoyed a period of internal peace and prosperity. A loan for  9 million, negotiated by the League of Nations, enabled the work of refugee settlement to proceed, and cleared the way for the financial development, without which progress would have been impossible. M. Veniselos signalised his return by concluding a conciliation and arbitration treaty with Italy; and in March 1929 the Greek Government signed a pact of friendship, conciliation and legal procedure with Yugoslavia, which was accompanied by a series of protocols finally disposing of the vexed question of Yugoslav access to the iEgean Sea. through the free zone of Salonica. Negotiations have now also been concluded between Greece and Turkey for the settlement of outstanding questions connected with the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations. For the last two or three years the internal condition of the country has been satisfactory and the future is promising. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no special commitments towards Greece, but her extensive trade, her mercantile marine, her commercial intercourse with London, and her history, have produced a more intelligent and friendly association between the Greek people and ourselves than can be found between the United Kingdom and any other country in South-Eastern Europe(d) Yugoslavia.In contrast to Bulgaria and Greece, Yugoslavia and Roumania stand each with one foot in the Balkans and the other in Central Europe His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no special commitments towards the former, with which relations are consistently friendly. The policy of the Yugoslav Government requires, however,  to be watched with an attention
sometimes amounting to anxiety, firstly, because the possibility of conflict with Bulgaria, to which allusion has already been made, is never absent; secondly, because Yugoslavia^ affiliations with France and her position as a riparian Power in the Adriatic have, as already explained, brought her into dangerous rivalry with Italy; and thirdly, because the internal conflict between Serbs, Croats and Slovenes continues to threaten the unity of the State and thus to weaken its international stability. A dictatorship superseded the constitutional Government of the country in 1928, but it is too early as yet to judge the merits of this new regime. So far it has done disappointingly little to ensure that the question how Serbs and Croats are to live together in unity may not be vexed.Great Britain&apos;s chief interest in Yugoslavia is to prevent her relations with Italy on the one hand and Bulgaria on the other from deteriorating to flash-point. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom accordingly make it a practice seasonably to urge on Yugoslavia the hard exercise of moderation and restraint in the face of reciprocated provocation either by the Fascist Govern-ment or press or by Macedonian terrorism. She needs at times to be assured that she is quite big now, and that it would pay her hand over fist so to apply her heart unto wisdom as to deprive her neighbours of pleasurable grievances. For the rest, His Majesty&apos;s Government try so far as they tactfully can to intimate to the Yugoslav Government that it is not in their own or anybody&apos;s interests to commit themselves to any one Power, meaning France, but rather to establish a general system of co-operation with all their neighbours generally or a better adverb indifferently. It should be added that it is the part of diplomacy to make the part of preacher less forbidding than this abbreviated scenario.(e) Roumania.Roumania is involved in the foreign politics of more important Powers, both as a member of the Little Entente and as the ruler of Bessarabia. She also has serious difficulties of her own, first in absorbing the extensive territories and the alien stocks given to her by the peace treaties, and, secondly, by the refusal of two of her neighbours to reconcile themselves to the treaty frontiers. Of the Hungarian frontier mention has already been made. As regards the Russian frontier, the Soviet Government has always refused to recognise the annexation of Bessarabia by Roumania on the collapse of the Tsarist regime. Nevertheless, in October 1920 a treaty was signed by Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Roumania that recognised the sovereignty of Roumania over Bessarabia, Great Britain, France, Italy and Roumania have ratified this treaty. The treaty, however, does not enter into force until it has been ratified by all the signatories and, although the Japanese Government stated soon after the ratification of the treaty by Italy that they would also ratify in the near future, there are at present no signs that they have in fact any intention of doing so, and, indeed, it would appear probable that, in view of Japan&apos;s proximity to Soviet Russia, they will not ratify the treaty at all. But if and when Japan ratifies, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will be bound by the Bessarabian Treaty to recognition of Roumanian sovereignty, and article 10 of the Covenant will come into operation in regard to it, should the Soviet Government be tempted by Roumanian instabilities to recover the province, as is eventually probable.(8) Poland.The size and geograj)hical position of Poland and the present strength of her army render the attitude of the Polish Government a serious factor in the politics of Eastern Europe. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United. Kingdom have consequently used their influence, on the one hand, to dissuade Poland from an aggressive or incautious policy towards any of her neighbours, and to promote, in so far as they properly can, any movement towards better relations with those neighbours; on the other hand, to make it clear to the Polish Government and public that they recognise Poland, within her present frontiers, as a stable and stabilising factor in post-war Europe, and will not lend themselves to any disturbance of the present position to Poland&apos;s detriment.
Thus, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have recognised Poland&apos;s position as a European Power by raising His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Warsaw to the status of an Embassy. They have done their best to prevent the Upper Silesian elections and similar questions from further embittering the relations of Poland and Germany, and they have also done their best, though with a considerable absence of success, to improve the relations of Poland with Lithuania.As regards Poland&apos;s relations with the Soviet Union, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom would be prepared to adopt a similar policy if there were any ground for holding that a rapprochement could be brought about by their good offices with either Government. At present there is no such sign, nor, in spite of some appearances to the contrary, is there any indication that either Government is in need of advice or warning to prevent the present uneasy, but not actively hostile, relations from developing into actual conflict. The Polish Government at least have given no reason to suppose that they have any such desire. Their policy towards the Soviet Union has of late years been studiously correct, and they are faced with such serious internal problems, both political and economic, as to make a continuation of this correct attitude almost imperative in their own interests. While it is not possible to speak with the same certainty of the attitude of the Soviet Government or to forecast the results of serious internal difficulties in Russia, similar consideration would seem, metu non moribus, perhaps, to compel the same policy in their case, also, for the time being. It may be noted that Poland and Roumania have renewed for a further period of five years their Treaty of Guarantee, which is in effect a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union.The relations of Poland with the Free City of Danzig are in a somewhat different category so far as this country is concerned. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, both as one of the Governments responsible for the creation of the Free City and as a member of the League of Nations, under whose control the Free City is placed in many respects, cannot divest themselves of a shared responsibility for seeing that the Danzig settlement is carried out. The Polish Government appear to be pursuing towards Danzig a policy of steady encroachment in political and, still more, in economic matters; while the Danzig Government, which has become distinctly more pugnacious since Dr. Ziehm became President of the Senate in January 1931, is accused of failing to give Polish citizens in Danzig proper protection from Nazi elements. The degree of responsibility which each side must bear for the present position is still in dispute, but it appears not impossible that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom may ultimately be called upon to take a stand in defence of the Danzig settlement.(9) Finland, Baltic States and Scandinavia.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards these countries is similar to their policy towards Poland. As in the case of Poland, His Majesty&apos;s Government have followed with sympathy their progress towards political and economic strength and stability, and have in some cases assisted that progress by such means as the loan of advisers; but they have throughout made it plain that, in their view, these States should pursue a peaceful and non-aggressive policy, and keep clear of political or economic combinations detrimental to their independence or political neutrality.The main preoccupation of all these States is to secure themselves against Soviet Russia; and with this object hints have been thrown out from the Baltic States, and in a lesser degree from Finland, that they would welcome a guarantee from His Majesty&apos;s Government of their independence, or of assistance if their neutrality were violated in the course of a war between Soviet Russia and some other Power. All such hints, however, have been met with the reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom cannot enter into any commitments other than those to which they are pledged as a member of the League of Nations. In Finland, the rapid growth during the past year of the aggressively nationalistic and anti-Soviet &quot;Lappo&quot; movement was a potentially disturbing factor, but the movement now appears to be sinking equally quickly into insignificance.
Lithuania, the most backward and the most corruptly governed of the three-Baltic States, continues to provide occasion for international bickering, owing to the unsatisfactory state of her relations with Poland, due to her refusal to renounce her claim to the Province of Vilna, and with Germany, due to her policy of eradicating all traces of German culture at Memel. In this latter question His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are directly concerned as one of the signatories to the Memel Convention of 1924. The Lithuanian Government, having carefully educated the Lithuanian people into a state of chauvinism and fervid hatred of anything Polish, are now powerless to embark upon a more moderate policy without risking their own existence.The same preoccupation with the maintenance of their independence is seen, though to a much smaller degree, in the Scandinavian States. In the case of Norway and Sweden danger is feared from Soviet Russia, and in the case of Denmark from Germany. In all three countries, however, but especially in Denmark, there exists a current of opinion that the best security from attack would be a policy of disarmament, which would show that the country adopting it could be no danger to its neighbours.(10) The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg.The independence of Belgium and Holland, and their continued retention of the mouths of the Scheldt, will, in the future, as in the past, remain of vital importance to this country. Apart from the Locarno treaties, we should be obliged, as in 1914, to resist the absorption or conquest of the Low Countries by any Great Power.Contrary to the general belief, the Treaty of Versailles itself did not. abrogate the treaties of 1839, by which the Powers guaranteed the neutrality of&quot; Belgium.   A separate instrument is required for this purpose, and nothing can be done in the matter until Belgium and Holland have settled their relations with each other by treaty.  It was only in 1925 that they at last succeeded in coming to -an agreement.   A new multilateral treaty was then drawn up to replace the multilateral treaty of 1839, and signed in 1926 on behalf of Great Britain, France, Belgium and Holland.   The new treaties were, however, rejected by the. Dutch Upper Chamber, owing, mainly, to the agitation promoted in Holland by the commercial and shipping interests at Rotterdam on the grounds that the provisions of the treaties were unduly favourable to Antwerp.   A deadlock was. reached, which still continues.The Belgians claim more adequate protection for freedom and security of navigation up the Scheldt to Antwerp, shorter and more convenient canal communication between Antwerp and the Rhine, and a larger volume of the heavy traffic of the Meuse for the port of Antwerp. They have rejected the Dutch offers as inadequate, and have lately sought to force the Dutch to make concessions by commencing the construction of a deep canal from Antwerp direct to the Meuse.It should, however, be noted that the points which concern this country, i.e., the termination of the guarantee of Belgian neutrality, the freedom of the Scheldt, and the status of Antwerp as a commercial port, are not in dispute at all. In view of the sensitiveness and jealousy of the two countries over a question which appears to them to affect their interests vitally, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have gently declined all requests of both parties or of the French Government to offer any advice or take any part in these negotiations, though repeatedly expressing their good washes for a successful solution of this difficult matter.The question of the status of Luxemburg is exceedingly involved. By the Treaty of London of 1867, the Powers guaranteed her neutrality. As in the case of the treaties of 1839 regarding Belgium, the Treaty of Versailles assumes that this regime of neutrality will be brought to an end, but does not specifically terminate it. The treaty of 1867 is, therefore, technically still in force. In 1920, however, Luxemburg applied for and was admitted unconditionally to membership of the League of Nations, and this is incompatible with the maintenance of her neutrality. The treaty of 1867, of which Luxemburg is a signatory, cannot be denounced without her concurrence, since it contains no clause enabling the parties thereto to denounce it, and no stipulation as to the length of its duration.   Luxemburg would hardly consent now to the abrogation
of this treaty and to the loss of her neutrality without receiving some sort of territorial guarantee in return. The question is further complicated by the decision of the French Government to send troops through Luxemburg if at any time they become involved in a war with Germany under conditions consistent with the Locarno treaties. The Committee of Imperial Defence have recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should accept no additional liability in the matter of the maintenance of the integrity of Luxemburg, and accordingly the French Ambassador, when he notified us in the autumn of 1929 that his Government had been sounded by the representative of Luxemburg as to their opinion on.the desirability of reopening the question of the status of the Grand Duchy, was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would be unwilling to entertain the idea of an extension in favour of Luxemburg of their commitments under the Locarno settlement. The matter has not been raised again, and is probably best left alone, though, theoretically, the position is an unsatisfactory one, both because Luxemburg&apos;s status as a member of the League of Nations is incompatible with the terms of the 1867 treaty and because Great Britain is still in the unenviable position of being a party to the collective guarantee of Luxemburg&apos;s neutrality, from which Germany, Austria and Russia have now been freed, and which we know France interprets in a most questionable sense. It is a commitment of which we should be well rid if we could do so without raising further difficulties.(11) Portugal.Under Anglo-Portuguese treaties, the earliest of which dates back to 1373, His Majesty&apos;s Government are under a general obligation to defend Portuguese territories and Colonies against all enemies of Portugal. The obligation contained in these treaties was confirmed in 1815 and 1899; and the preamble of the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of 1904 (Treaty of Windsor) refers to &quot;the friendship and alliance which have happily subsisted for so long a period between them (the two monarchs) and the two nations which they represent,&quot; and would thus appear to recognise once more the validity of the old treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese declaration of 1899 quoted and specifically confirmed the following passage frorh the treaty of 1661 : &quot; Over and above all and singular agreed and concluded .... it is by this secret article concluded and accorded that His Majesty of Great Britain .... shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth, to defend and protect all conquests or Colonies belonging to the Crown of Portugal against all his enemies as well future as present.&apos;&apos;The Portuguese colonial possessions are : In Africa : Portuguese East Africa, Portuguese West Africa, Guinea, Cape Verde Islands, Sao Tome and Principe Islands; in Asia : Timor; Goa, Damao and Diu in India; Macao in China. The Azores and Madeira have not the status of Colonies, but are regarded as an integral part of the territory of Portugal itself.It is clear, therefore, that we are under a general obligation to defend Portuguese territories and Colonies against all enemies of Portugal. This obliga-tion has been explicitly acknowledged several times during the last century, and, on at least one occasion, in 1826, when the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was requested by Portugal&quot; under the treaties, an armed force was sent. It is to be noted, however, that, in consequence presumably of the antiquity of most of the treaties in question and the very different circumstances of their conclusion, this country has in the past considered itself entitled to scrutinise each Portuguese invocation; and. in 1873 Her Majesty&apos;s Minister at Lisbon was specifically instructed to make it clear to the Government of Portugal &apos;&apos; that Her Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to themselves to judge of the circumstances under which any appeal was made to them by Portugal for succour.&quot; In regard to this point, the late Sir E. Hertslet wrote in 1877 : &quot; It will, therefore, be seen that, although the old treaties of alliance and guarantee are admitted to be still in force, yet Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have never considered that they are bound under all circumstances to defend Portugal as England itself; on the contrary, that they have reserved
to themselves the right of judging of the circumstances in which help may be given or withheld!; or, in other words, that, whilst the old treaties give this country a right to interfere in any case of external attack against Portugal, they do not compel it to do so.&apos;&apos;In 1913, since when nothing has occurred to modify the situation, Sir E. Grey wrote as follows : &quot; The conclusion, therefore, seems to be that while the treaties are admitted to be still in force, His Majesty*s Government reserve to themselves the right of judging the circumstances under which help may be given or withheld.&quot;Despite the fact that a series of troublesome questions have led to much argument between ourselves and the Portuguese, it is fairly true to say that the: British alliance is the sheet-anchor of Portuguese foreign policy, and that in any matter of really first-class importance we can count on Portuguese support. Such support would be of negative rather than positive worth. As a military or naval Power, Portugal is of little account, but the denial to a hostile Power of the mouth of the Tagus and the Portuguese Atlantic islands might be of considerable value to us in an emergency.Of late years conditions in Portugal have taken a turn for the better. Under the dictatorship the finances have been placed on a comparatively sound basis; and progress has undoubtedly been made with the material development of the country. There has,, however, been a steadily growing under-current of sedition and intrigue against the Government, who, at the moment of writing, have ground for uneasiness. Gratitude for the benefits conferred by the dictator-ship is giving way to resentment at its restrictions; and Dr. Salazar, the all-powerful Minister of Finance, has, as was inevitable, incurred a considerable part of the blame for the repercussions in Portugal of the world economic crisis. Revolts in Madeira, the Azores and elsewhere in PortugaPs overseas possessions, organised by political deportees in the hope of sympathetic anti-governmental movements within Portugal, have just been successfully suppressed with little or no less of life; but rumours of unrest within Portugal continue to be current; and the reactions of recent developments in Spain must have been considerable. The general situation, in fact, is one of uncertainty.Anglo-Portuguese relations have, since the war, tended to be marred by a wave of nationalism. These feelings have led the Portuguese to impede the legitimate activities of foreign enterprises established within Portuguese territory, and have in consequence given rise to a number of tiresome and acrimonious disputes. Since last autumn, however, there has been a decided change for the better in the Portuguese attitude as far as Great Britain has been concerned; and welcome efforts on the part of the Government at Lisbon to settle outstanding questions led His Majesty&apos;s Government, as a mark of appreciation,, to send a representative naval detachment there in January. This visit had the happiest effects; and the good impression created was more than confirmed by an official visit of the Prince of Wales to Lisbon on the 25th April. Meanwhile, the Portuguese Government have been considering tenders for a naval building programme of some  3 million. Most of the leading British shipbuilding firms, competed, and substantial orders have resulted.With regard to Africa, the maintenance of good relations between the Portuguese Colonies and the neighbouring British territories is &quot;important in view of the fact that the lines of communication through these territories to Lourenco Marques and Beira in the East and to Lobito in the West run across Portuguese territory. In particular, the impending opening of the Benguella Railway to through traffic via Lobito to Northern Rhodesia, has raised the question of facilities for British goods transported by that route, a subject which is at present being closely studied.It may be convenient to record two other facts here. First, in 1928 the Union Government concluded a treaty with the Portuguese Government establishing certain arrangements regarding customs, supply of labour, railways, &amp;c, between the Union and Mozambique; secondly, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have under examination the details of the financing of the construction of a railway bridge over the Zambesi, so as to permit of direct communication between Nyasaland and the sea.
A further point to which it is worth calling attention is the importance of the Portuguese Atlantic islands as a landing ground on the Transatlantic air route. In 1928 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were approached by the Portuguese Government with a suggestion that they should assist in the organisation of commercial flying services in Portugal and the Portuguese Colonies. His Majesty&apos;s Government were, however, reluctantly compelled for financial reasons to decline the offer; and in consequence a concession was granted to a company which, though Portuguese in name, is to all intents French in fact. This company, however, has recently found itself in serious financial difficulties; and the situation is being watched in order that, if it fails to fulfil its contract His Majesty&apos;s Government may secure that any alternative arrangement made by the Portuguese Government should be of a somewhat less restrictive character with reference to the use of these islands by other foreign aircraft.The most tiresome question at issue between Great Britain and Portugal to-day is that of flag discrimination. As the result of strong representations certain features of this discrimination, e.g., quay dues, were recently abolished by the Portuguese Government. But the customs privileges accorded to the portuguese-guese mercantile marine, which foreign shipping interests specially resent, remain in force; and it is not thought that the Portuguese Government will dare to give way regarding them unless effective counter-measures can be devised. The possibility of such measures is under active consideration.(12) Spain.The last three months have witnessed a series of epoch-making events in Spain.General Berenguer, a trusted adviser of King Alfonso, succeeded General Primo de Bivera, on the latter&apos;s fall in January 1930. He attempted a policy of employing dictatorial methods to effect a gradual return to constitutionalism. This policy, however, carried no conviction with the parties of the Left. A widespread republican outbreak in December was nipped in the bud; but it fatally weakened the Prime Minister&apos;s position; and the secession from him of the other political parties, on the issue mainly whether the proposed new Cortes should or should not have power to revise the King&apos;s prerogatives, left him in the middle of February with no alternative but to resign. The King, after offering powder to the anti-monarchical groups in circumstances which demonstrated their incapacity to accept, finally nominated Admiral Aznar with a Conservative-Liberal coalition of a strong monarchical colour. Admiral Aznar took office on the 18th February; but his Cabinet, though a strong one, adopted measures of extreme conciliation, and announced that unfettered elections wrould shortly be held. This goal, however, was never reached. The municipal elections which intervened showred a decisive majority against the Monarchy, in all the principal cities of Spain; and the outbursts of popular enthusiasm which greeted the announcement of the results on the 13th April demonstrated that the position not only of the Government but of the King himself had become untenable. It was found impossible to guarantee the loyalty of the army. His Majesty accordingly left Spain the next day, declaring, however, that he did so only to avoid bloodshed, and that he had not abdicated pending a constitutional expression of the will of the nation.A Provisional Government under Seiior Zamora, composed of the leaders of the republican revolt of the preceding December, took office amid scenes of delirious excitement. They were formally recognised by the Powers, in advance of the general elections, which, they announced, would take place in June. The necessary notes of recognition on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and the Dominions were presented by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid on the 21st April.Senor Zamora started well, making it clear that he wished to pursue a policy of moderation and generosity. He found himself, however, in difficulties at once over the terms of Catalonia&apos;s declaration of independence, a problem complicated by the undoubted existence of a similar if more latent spirit of regionalism in the
Basque Provinces and elsewhere. He is now confronted with dangerous out-breaks of anti-clerical and anti-monarchist violence throughout the country, in which traces of Communist organisation are evident. These are in full progress at the moment of writing; and his apparent inability to control the situation has already gravely damaged his prestige and inspires apprehensions for the future.The relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the new Government have been cordial so far as they have gone, and there are no problems in prospect which seems likely to disturb them. In face of the complete uncertainty of the present position, however, nothing can usefully be said of the future.4. THE SOVIET UNION.The resumption of diplomatic relations in December 1929 opened the way to fresh political and commercial relations with the Soviet Union.Political relations, however, have remained clouded, mainly owing to the propagandist activities of the Communist International, which are still being carried onv&quot;.hi various degrees of intensity in many parts of the Empire, in spite of the pledges against propaganda which were exchanged when diplomatic relations were resumed. It becomes ever clearer that the Soviet Government, controlled as they are by the Communist party, who regard propaganda as essential to the ultimate success of the Communist experiment, will give no satisfaction to &apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter. Their inactivity and their repeated disclaimers of responsibility merely serve to deepen the latent distrust which has for long characterised the relations between the two countries  a distrust which is mutual and has by no means been diminished by the sustained anti-Soviet campaigns organised by certain powerful units of the British press.Commercial relations have improved. British exports to the Soviet Union for 1929 showed an increase of 50 per cent, over those for 1928 a rate of increase which was maintained in 1930. The improvement in this respect, however, has not been nearly so rapid as might have been expected. The Soviet Government allege that British prices are generally higher than continental prices, and that the credit facilities available in the United Kingdom are not so favourable as those obtainable elsewhere. This country is, in fact, not getting its share of Russian trade, and the position is most unsatisfactory.The attention of the Soviet Government is concentrated on pressing forward the reconstruction of industry and the industrialisation of agriculture, on which depends the success of the Five-Year Plan, whereby it is hoped to turn one-sixth of the globe into a self-contained economic entity independent of the rest of the world.Reports indicate that substantial progress is being made towards the realisation of the plan, in spite of increased difficulties caused to Soviet economy by the world slump, the duration and severity of which could not have been foreseen by the framers of the plan. Probably the plan is not expected to be a complete success within the allotted time, but even a partial success may make the Soviet Union a serious competitor in the industrial markets of the world, in which case the question will arise whether a communistic State with a population of 160 millions, increasing yearly at the rate of 3^ millions, can live at peace side by side with States run on capitalist lines.In view of the internal problems necessarily resulting from the application of so ambitious a policy of reconstruction, it would at first sight appear little short of madness for the Soviet Government to embark upon any foreign adventure, and, indeed, there is no present sign of any such intention. There is, however, always a disturbing element in the ceaselesssly reiterated idea of the Soviet leaders that their country is surrounded by a ring of capitalistic States awaiting and preparing a favourable moment for attack. This regrettable illusion appears to be genuinely held and is impressed upon the Russian people by all the means of publicity. Every event is judged by its effect on the Five-Year Plan, and the embargoes placed by certain European and American countries on imports of Russian goods have merely enabled the present rulers of Russia to foster the illusion, stir up the people to greater efforts, and plead for more armaments, while doing lip-service to the cause of disarmament at Geneva. It may be mentioned in passing that the Soviet Union is a party to the International
Treaty for the Renunciation of War, signed at Paris in 1928. It would be inadvisable wholly to disregard the possibility that the Soviet Government might, in the event of serious internal difficulties, seek relief by utilising for a foreign war the anti-foreign prejudices which they so carefully, and from their point of view necessarily, foster. In such an event the Roumanian frontier appears to be the most likely point of danger. Here the Soviet Government have a permanent pretext for a quarrel in the shape of Bessarabia, In this connexion it may not be without significance that the relations between the Soviet Government and France steadily deteriorate, while those with Germany and Turkey show improvement. The latter, however, lives in constant and well-founded apprehension of her northern neighbour, and this fear is one of several reasons for her recent overtures to us.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the Soviet Union may be summarised as strict abstention from interference in the Union&apos;s internal affairs, the promotion of trade relations between the two countries, and the improvement of political relations so far as the activities of the Communist International and the history of the past ten years will allow. A Temporary Commercial Agreement providing for most-favoured-nation treatment for British and Soviet goods respectively was signed on the 16th April, 1930. This was followed on the 22nd May, 1930, by the signature of a Temporary Fisheries Agreement enabling fishing vessels registered at ports in the United Kingdom to fish without fear of interruption up to 3 miles of the North Russian coast.The following matters are under negotiation between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Government: (1) A treaty regarding the application of treaties and conventions concluded with the former Imperial Russian Government; and(2) An agreement for the settlement of debts and claims, in which no progress has been made.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have made it clear to-the Soviet Government that they do not consider that a definitive Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the two countries will be possible until substantial progress has been made in the negotiations regarding debts and claims.5.-AFRICA. (1) Egypt.British policy in Egypt is based primarily on the Declaration to Egypt of the 28th February, 1922, under which, whilst recognising Egypt as an independent sovereign State, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to their absolute discretion, pending the conclusion of agreements with Egypt in regard thereto (a) The security of the communications of the British Empire in Egypt. (&amp;) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference, direct or indirect.(c) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt.(d) The Sudan.An immediate sequel to the approval of the declaration by Parliament was the notification conveyed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to all foreign Powers on the 15th March, 1922.  This notification concluded with the following passage :  &quot; These special relations (i.e., between Great Britain and Egypt) are defined in the declaration recognising Egypt as an independent sovereign State. His Majesty&apos;s Government have laid them down as matters in which the rights and interests of the British Empire are vitally involved, and will not admit them to be questioned or discussed by any other Power. In pursuance of this principle, they will regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another Power, and they will consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command.&quot;
It is clear from the preceding paragraphs that we are definitely committed to the defence of Egyptian territory. As long as we hold the command of the Mediterranean and the mandate for Palestine, the defence of Egypt against foreign aggression resolves itself into preventing invasion across the western frontier. In practice, a serious attempt at invasion can only take place across the strip of hard desert between Siwa Oasis and Sollum, a distance of about 150 miles, readily defensible by light armoured cars with the co-operation of aeroplanes.But, pending the conclusion of a treaty settlement with Egypt as contem-plated in the 1922 declaration, we are committed not merely to the defence of the Suez Canal, but to the defence of British communications in Egypt (a much wider expression) and the protection of foreign interests. So long as British troops remain in Cairo and Alexandria we cannot in the last resort disclaim all responsi-bility for the maintenance of internal order. British forces in the capital must be strong enough not merely to look after themselves, but to afford protection to the large foreign communities until outside help can arrive.That a treaty settlement must ultimately be achieved is evident, and successive Governments have recognised this fact, as witness the negotiations in 1924, 1927, 1929, and*those which took place in 1930. The latter came near to success, so near, in fact, that means may eventually be found to get over the remaining difficulties, the chief of which arises out of the Egyptian claim to the Sudan.(2) The Sudan.Under the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1899 the British flag is flown together with the Egyptian flag throughout the Sudan, and the Governor-General, in whom is vested &quot; the supreme military and civil command of the Sudan,&quot; is appointed &quot; on the recommendation of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and shall be removed only .... with the consent of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.&quot; The effect of these provisions is to make His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom ultimately responsible for law and order throughout the Sudan. The removal of all Egyptian forces from the Sudan at the end of 1924, following on the murder in Cairo of the then Governor-General, has only lent emphasis to a situation which was already tacitly recognised.The European Powers other than Great Britain possessing Colonies coterminous with the Sudan are France, Belgium and Italy. The danger of hostilities with either of the two first-named Powers hardly appears to be sufficiently real to merit serious consideration in present circumstances. In the case of Italy, it appears unlikely that Eritrea, which is dependent for touch with the outside world on communication through the Red Sea, could be used as a base for serious military operations against the Sudan. Apart from Egypt, the only other foreign Power coterminous with the Sudan is Abyssinia. Political upheavals in that country are always possible, and might conceivably create so dangerous a situation on the frontier as to call for more extensive precautions than those at present taken by the Sudan Government. These are designed to deal with the occasional raids across the frontier for loot and ivory, in which Abyssinian soldiers have sometimes participated.But there is much inflammable material. Egyptian public opinion has been deliberately encouraged to demand a greater share in the administration of the Sudan. A recrudescence of Egyptian propaganda is to be expected, and may stimulate the growth of local nationalism. The unrest engendered by such activities can only increase the danger of an outbreak of Mahdism, which, though latent, is none the less alive. On the whole, therefore, internal disorder rather than foreign aggression appears to constitute the chief danger which might call for an increase in the British garrison.(3) Abyssinia.The Tripartite Agreement of 1906 between Great Britain, France and Italy provides under article 1 that the three Powers named &quot; shall co-operate in main-taining the political and territorial status quo in Ethiopia as determined by the state of affairs at present existing.&quot; This is qualified by article 3, which provides that &quot; in the event of rivalries or internal changes in Ethiopia, the representa-tives of France, Great Britain and Italy shall observe a neutral attitude,
abstaining from all intervention in the internal affairs of the country, and confining themselves to such action as may be, by common consent, considered necessary for the protection of the Legations, of the lives and property of foreigners and of the common interests of the three Powers. In no case shall one of the three Governments interfere in any manner whatsoever except in agreement with the other two.&quot;The stability of the Abyssinian Government depends largely on its present ruler, Taffari Makonnen, for some time regent and now Emperor Haile Sillassie I, who has succeeded in greatly extending his control over the outlying districts. His work in this direction is far from completed, but it is noteworthy that raids from Abyssinia into neighbouring British territories have been less common in the last few years. The complete collapse of the recent revolt shows that the Emperor can deal with any isolated rebellion, but many of the provincial chiefs feax his growing power and concerted action against him is therefore a possibility, though mutual jealousy is some guarantee against such a combination.The sudden death of the Emperor would precipitate a more serious crisis. There is no obvious successor and the more important chiefs would probably all press their claims. A number of petty kingdoms might even emerge from the resulting confusion.The ambitions of Italy have also to be considered. Italian policy is to secure a predominating influence in Abyssinia. Its disruption might therefore lead to an endeavour to extend the frontiers of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, and this would certainly meet with opposition from France, who is jealous of any increase of Italian influence.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have no desire to acquire further territory, and their chief concern is that the administration of the central Government should be effective throughout Abyssinia so that frontier raids and similar incidents should be reduced to a minimum.The chief material interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is the proposed dam at the outlet of Lake Tsana to store water for the irrigation of Egypt and the Sudan, and some measure of agreement with the Abyssinian Government has now been reached.It follows that British military action in Abyssinia is unlikely except in the event of a complete collapse of the central authority, when military intervention might become necessary to protect the lives and property of British subjects and to guard against any interference with the working of the Tsana Dam. Once the dam is in full operation any interference with its working would have a disastrous effect upon large areas of the Sudan and Egypt, so that disturbances dangerous to the dam could not be regarded with indifference by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.(4) Morocco.When in 1904 His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to French predominance in Mciocco in return for British predominance in Egypt, it was only on condition that the Mediterranean coast of Morocco should be handed over to Spain and Tangier remain under a special regime. By article 7 of the Anglo-French declaration of 1904 both French and British Governments are pledged &quot; not to permit the erection of any fortifications or strategic works on that portion of the coast of Morocco comprised between, but not including, Melilla and the heights which command the right bank of the River Sebou.&quot; The French Government are also pledged not to modify the existing territorial status in Morocco without previous consultation with Spain and Great Britain.We are not prepared to see the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, and especially the southern shore of the Straits of Gibraltar, in the hands of a first-class Power, and some apprehensions were aroused in 1925 by the initial successes of the Riffis against the Spaniards. Had the Spaniards been finally driven out of the Spanish Zone, a most embarrassing situation would have arisen. We are certainly not prepared to take over the Riff coast ourselves, and equally we are not prepared to see the French installed between Ceuta and Melilla. Happily, this danger was averted, and order was restored in the Spanish Zone. How long it will remain undisturbed under the present regime is another question, for subversive propaganda is already busy.   In the French Zone the French
continue to extend their authority, and the unpacified areas shrink in size year by year. The material prosperity of the country increases apace, helped on by steps such as the construction of the Tangier-Fez Railway; and co-operation between the authorities of the three zones is becoming more frequent and more efficacious. Morocco is one of the few countries where British subjects still enjoy capitulatory rights, and the continuance of these rights is a latent source of irritation to the French. An attempt made by the French some years ago to bring about the termination of the Capitulations was successfully countered, but the maintenance of the system will become increasingly difficult in the future, more esjDecially if the French at our instigation should surrender their capitulatory rights in Egypt. It has, therefore, become important to ensure that, if and when British Capitulations have to be surrendered, definite assurances are obtained from France that our general and commercial interests shall not be endangered.   This problem is being carefully studied.The position of Tangier has been a particular pre-occupation to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The possession and fortification of Tangier by any Power would weaken our position in the Western Mediterranean and would compromise our lines of communication with the East. It has, therefore, been a cardinal factor in the policy of successive British Governments to prevent this, and the whole web of Moroccan treaties since 1904, to which Great Britain is a party, provides for the establishment at Tangier of an international regime.The exact -nature of this international regime was the subject of long diplomatic discussions between France, Spain and Great Britain, which terminated in December 1923 in the conclusion of the Tangier Convention. Article 3 of the convention provides that the Tangier Zone shall be placed under a regime of permanent neutrality, and that no act of hostility on land, on sea or in the air shall be committed by or against the zone or within its boundaries. The terms of this article impose on Great Britain no obligation to guarantee the neutrality of Tangier or to protect it from attack. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government are undoubtedly under the implied obligation to do all they can to preserve the neutrality of Tangier, and they would doubtless be entitled to invoke the Tangier Convention as justification for intervening to ensure the neutrality of the zone. When in July 1925, the contingency of an attack on Tangier by Abd-el-Krim arose, the Committee of Imperial Defence &quot; deemed the maintenance of the neutrality of the international zone at Tangier so important that if this zone were attacked they would be ready to join in concerted defence measures,&quot; and the War Office wrere requested to prepare plans for the despatch of a force of two brigades and ancillary units. What the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be if the neutrality of Tangier were violated by a European Power, for example, Italy, in a Avar against France, or France in a war against Spain, it is not easy to forecast in detail; but British interests would certainly demand that every possible effort should be made to ensure respect for the neutrality of the zone.The Tangier convention of 1923 was completed by a protocol signed in July 1928 providing inter alia for the accession of Italy to the convention on practically the same footing as the three original signatory Powers. The accession of Italy removes the risk of friction arising from her exclusion from the 1923 conference, and materially assists the local administration.The international regime, though it is still in its youth and has to meet with many difficulties, financial and otherwise, is functioning as well as can be expected, and there would seem to be no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should alter their policy of giving it their consistent support.Until recently the principal menace to the existing order came from Spain, who hankered after the incorporation of Tangier in the Spanish Zone, and from the suspicion with which France, not unnaturally, views the activities of Spain at Tangier. The recent relations of the two Powers have, however, improved and they have tended to collaborate in order to secure their joint predominance in the Tangier Zone. There is no reason to fear any danger to vital British interests from this collaboration.By an exchange of notes in May 1907 the British, French and Spanish Governments declared their resolve to preserve intact their rights over their respective insular and maritime possessions in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic Ocean, and to concert with each other in the event of any threatened disturbance in the existing territorial status quo.
6. ASIA (THE NEAR EAST). (1) Turkey.The relations between the British Empire and the modern Turkish State are based on the Lausanne Peace Settlement, which was signed on the 24th July, 1923, and entered into force on the 6th August, 1924. The commercial convention, which formed part of that peace settlement, having expired in 1929, a new commercial treaty between the United Kingdom and Turkey was signed on the 1st March, 1930, and came into force on the 3rd September, 1930. Negotiations have also been opened for a commercial treaty between Turkey and India, and may be opened shortly for commercial treaties between Turkey and Canada and Turkey and the Irish Free State. A commercial modus vivendi with the Irish Free State is already in force.Modern Turkey is chiefly of importance, from the point of view of British foreign policy, as controlling maritime access to the Black Sea, and as being a border State of somewhat uncertain political orientation contiguous in the East with Soviet territory. The importance formerly enjoyed by Turkey in the Moslem world, and in the eyes of the Indian Moslems in particular, as the seat of the Caliphate, has been brought to an end by Mustafa KemaFs fairly successful abolition of Islam as the State religion in Turkey and has now to some extent passed to Arabia. There are at times indications that Turkey aspires to take the lead in forming a chain of associated States running from Asia Minor to India. This possibility has occasionally been represented as a danger to British interests. It is more probably due to an instinctive desire on the part of Turkey to secure potential political support from States placed in a geographical and political position somewhat similar to her own in any future emergency.As regards Turkey&apos;s control of maritime access to the Black Sea, British policy since the war has aimed at securing and maintaining complete freedom of the Straits. This policy culminated in the conclusion of the Straits Con-vention, which forms part of the Lausanne Peace Settlement, and British potential obligations in regard to the freedom of the Straits are defined in article 18 of that convention, which runs as follows : &quot; The high contracting parties, desiring to secure that the demilitarisation-tion of the Straits and of the contiguous zones shall not constitute an unjustifiable danger to the military security of Turkey, and that no act of war should imperil the freedom of the Straits or the safety of the demilitarised zones, agree as follows : &quot; Should the freedom of navigation of the Straits or the security of the demilitarised zones be imperilled by a violation of the provisions relating to freedom of passage, or by a surprise attack or some act of war or threat of war, the high contracting parties, and in any case France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, acting in conjunction, will meet such violation, attack, or other act of war or threat of war, by all the means that the Council of the League of Nations may decide for this purpose.&quot; So soon as the circumstances which may have necessitated the action provided for in the preceding paragraph shall have ended, the regime of the Straits, as laid down by the terms of the present convention, shall again be strictly applied.&quot; The present provision, which forms an integral part of those relating to the demilitarisation and to the freedom of the Straits, does not prejudice the rights and obligations of the high contracting parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations.&quot;The provisions of this article in effect do little more than extend to the Straits the provisions of articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations; and should Turkey eventually implement the promise given at Lausanne and become a member of the League, it is questionable whether they will carry British responsibility any further than it already goes under the Covenant.As regards Turkey&apos;s position towards Russia, her policy has in general been to hold the balance evenly between the Soviet Union and Western Europe. This policy has been attended with no small measure of success, since she has succeeded in concluding pacts of friendship and neutrality with Russia on the one hand, and with France and Italy on the other, without risking a dispute with either
side. It has been difficult to see, however, how Turkey could, consistently with this policy, take so definite a step in a westerly direction as to join the &quot;League of Nations. On the other hand, under the increasing fear of increased Russian militarism and eventual aggression, Turkey is showing an increasing interest in the League, and has more than once formulated conditions on which she would be prepared to join.   These conditions have hitherto been impossible of acceptance.A protocol providing for the limitation of naval armaments in the Black Sea was signed with Russia in March 1931, while a general settlement of all out-standing difficulties between Turkey and Greece was reached at Angora in October 1930, when a Graeco-Turkish Naval Agreement was also signed. British relations with Turkey have steadily improved since the conclusion in June 1926 of the Treaty of Angora, which finally settled the Turco-Iraqi frontier dispute. During the last year, they have been particularly satisfactory. No source of serious friction between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Turkish Government now remains.Internally, the dictatorship of Mustafa Kemal maintains its firm hold on the country. The most disquieting feature of the present situation is the serious state of Turkey&apos;s finances. This has been particularly manifest since the autumn of 1929, and is primarily due to over-expenditure on national defence again due to fear of Russia which absorbs over one-third of the total revenue of the State. There is, however, nothing to indicate that Turkey contemplates a policy of external adventure or that her pacific protestations are insincere.(2) Persia.The primary objects of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in their relations with Persia are (1) the defence of legitimate British interests and the protection of the lives and properties of British subjects; and (2) the safety and integrity of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, and especially India. The existence of a stable, progressive and friendly Persia is an important factor in the furtherance of these aims. It is therefore the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain good relations with Persia, and, while refraining from any action which might possibly be interpreted as direct or active intervention in the internal. affairs of the country, to stimulate and encourage, through His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Tehran, such elements as may be sincerely striving for its welfare and better government. Integrity and efficiency are still, however, rare in Persia. It is not in any way their desire to bring about unfriendly relations between Persia and Russia, and they particularly wish to avoid a renewal of the position obtaining before the war, when Persia was the cockpit of overt Anglo-Russian rivalry. But unfortunately the Persian Govern-ment show&quot; a not unnatural tendency to play off British and Russian interests against each other; and, while Russia is, from her geographical position, able to bring pressure to bear on Persia in order to secure her demands, and does not hesitate to do so, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no levers which could be used in order to induce Persia to meet their legitimate desiderata. It is for this reason probably that the Shah and his Minister of Court have of late been so offensively anti-British.A predominating interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Persia is the maintenance of the safety and prosperity of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This company&apos;s concession in South Persia still has many years to run, but the company is occasionally and recently with considerable virulence subjected to Persian attack. Fortunately, however, the Persian Government are to a great extent dependent on the royalties which they receive from the company, and which are one of their few reliable sources of revenue. It would therefore not be to the interest of any Persian-Government to make the position of the company too difficult. Meanwhile, it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in full agreement with the company, to allow the company to settle its affairs with the Persian Government as far as possible without official intervention.As regards the Persian Gulf, it has long been the view of the Governments of Great Britain and of India that they do, in fact, possess special interests in those regions. British blood and treasure have for more than a century been spent in suppressing piracy, the slave trade, and the arms traffic, in its waters; its lighting and buoying, and, until recently, its sanitary defence, have been entirely instituted and carried out by British and Indian enterprise. Great Britain and India have never claimed any exclusive rights in the Gulf, although
they have stated publicly the grave concern and disapproval with which they would view any attempt by a foreign and non-riparian Power to challenge or undermine their special position in that area, e.g., by the creation of a naval base, which would threaten the safety of sea communications with India. Lord Lansdowne declared in the House of Lords in May 1903 that &quot; we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.&quot;In view of the proposed negotiations with the Persian Government on questions closely affecting the British position in the Persian Gulf (see next paragraph), a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was set up on the 25th June, 1928, to examine British policy in the Persian Gulf in the light of the present position. On the 29th October, 1928, the sub-committee produced an interim report(1) containing the following conclusions and recommendations, which were adopted by the CabinetQ : &quot; (a) The maintenance of British supremacy in the Persian Gulf is, if anything, more essential to the security of India and to Imperial interests at the present time than it was in the past.&quot; (b) Our interests are exposed to dangers not less in degree, though differing in kind, from those to which they were liable in the past. Modern developments, such as air power and cross-country traction, and more particularly the probability of the construction of a railway between Northern Persia and the Gulf, have increased the potential risks to which our interests are exposed.&quot; (c) In order to maintain our supremacy it is necessary to prevent any foreign Power from establishing a naval base or fortified port in the Persian Gulf, or air undertakings within striking distance of the Gulf. We must retain sufficient harbour facilities in the Gulf for our navy, and these must be conveniently situated for the operation of mine-sweeping and other vessels required to safeguard the sea passage through the Gulf in time of war. We should press on with the measures required to establish and secure our strategic and civil air routes along the shores of the Gulf. On the Arabian littoral we should retain the status quo in its entirety. On the Persian littoral we should maintain the status quo to the utmost limit that political considerations will admit.&apos;&apos;(d) It is important to develop the air routes on both sides of the Gulf, namely, the civil air route along the Persian shore and the strategic air route along the Arabian shore. No immediate initiative, however, should be taken to try to obtain from the Persian Government an extension of the three years at present granted for the operation of the civil air route, but he (His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran) should have instructions to insist on Persia carrying out in the spirit their side of the arrangement made with Imperial Airways. On the Arabian side of the Gulf every possible effort should be made by political means to prepare the way for the development of the air route. Wherever the conditions are favourable, early steps should be taken to secure the necessary aerodromes and facilities, and, if necessary, financial consideration should be given to the chiefs concerned for this purpose.&quot; (e) From a political point of view, the services we have rendered to civilisation and humanity in the Gulf, by the suppression of piracy, the slave trade and the arms traffic, the maintenance of order, the provision and upkeep of aids to navigation, &amp;c, place us in a strong moral position. In many of the detailed matters in dispute between Persia and ourselves,, however, our legal title is weak.&quot; (/) In Persia there has been a strong revival of nationalism under the stimulus of the present Shah, who, after establishing the authority of the Central Government over the greater part of Persia, is now seeking to reduce our position in the Gulf. Though Persia is incapable of undertaking efficiently the functions we now fulfil, or of ejecting us by force, the weakness of our legal status, combined with Persians membership of the League of Nations, creates for us a position of some difficulty.(!) C.I.D. Paper No. 169-D. (3) Cabinet 49 (28), Conclusion 1, and C.I.D. Paper No. 170-D.
&quot; (g) Our wisest course in the present circumstances is to avoid reference to the League of Nations if we can, and to endeavour to reach a general settlement with Persia.....&quot; (h) On the Arabian shore of the Gulf our position is governed by a series of treaties placing under our protection the territories of the rulers of Koweit, Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and, for practical purposes, Muscat, the independence of which, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government and France jointly guarantee to respect. The rise of the Wahabi King, Ibn Saud, to hegemony over the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula is a disturbing factor in our political relations with the chiefs concerned, as well as in the development of the southern air route.&apos;&apos; (i) The best way in Avhich the menace of the Wahabis and the danger of their conquest or absorption of the sheikhs can be averted is by securing the friendship of Ibn Saud. This will take time. In the meanwhile, it is essential to support the sheikhs by an active demonstration of our will and power to protect their legitimate rights in accordance with our treaties. In the forthcoming negotiations with Persia our representative should have instructions that it is an essential part of our policy to defend the sheikhs on the Arabian shore against the claims of the Persian Government.&apos;&apos; (j) Although we think it improbable that the Persians will attempt to prejudice the forthcoming negotiations by forcible action, we recommend, in order to be on the safe side, that the Admiralty should instruct the Naval Commander-in-chief that the status quo is to be maintained in the Gulf, and that he is to prevent (even by force, in the last resort) the occupation by Persia of Tamb and Abu Musa Islands.&quot;In October 1927 Persia reached a comprehensive settlement of all her out-standing disputes with Russia, and thereupon professed a strong desire to reaci-a similar settlement with Great Britain. Conversations between the Persian Minister of Court (who is at present by far the most powerful and anti-British of the Persian Ministers) and His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran resulted, on the 10th May, 1928, in the signature of an Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty, accompanied or followed by certain other agreements, amongst the most important of which was a three years&apos; authority for Imperial Airways to use the South Persian route for their service to India. This three years&apos; period actually started on the 1st April, 1929. Sir R. Clive&apos;s negotiations were resumed in November 1928. The text of a Commercial Treaty, supplementing the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of May 1928, had, by the autumn of 1930, been almost agreed upon; but little progress had been made with the negotiations for the more important General Treaty, which was intended to deal, inter alia, with mutual non-aggression, the renunciation by Persia of ancient claims to certain Arabian islands in the Gulf, and the settlement of such outstanding questions as the Persian Debt to Great Britain. The feeling of nationalism referred to under heading (J) of the preceding paragraph has indeed recently assumed, under the direction of the Minister of Court, an increasingly xenophobe character, and Anglo-Persian relations have proportionately deteriorated. The Persian Govern-ment appear lately to have become indifferent to the conclusion of the proposed comprehensive settlement with Great Britain, and have rendered a continuance of negotiations, for the present at least, impossible.The commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Persia were sensibly reduced on the 1st March, 1931, by the handing over to Persia of the telegraph syjstem hitherto worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India, and by the closing of the British Indo-European Telegraph Company&apos;s line from Tehran to Europe.Persia has recently introduced a Government monopoly of foreign trade. It is too soon to estimate the final effects of this grotesque measure aped from Russia, but it will obviously and seriously injure British commercial interests in Persia, and tend to further Russian, at the expense of British, trade.(3) Arabia.(a) The Hejaz and Nejd. The relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with King Ibn Saud of the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies are governed by the Treaty of Jedda, signed on
the 20th May (ratifications exchanged the 17th September), 1927. The treaty contains no commitments.King Ibn Saud, since his conquest of the Hejaz in 1925, has maintained cordial relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is, indeed, in his interest to do so, in view of the pre-eminent position occupied by Great Britain in Iraq, Trans Jordan, the Persian Gulf, Eastern and Southern Arabia and the Red Sea. It is equally an important British and Imperial interest that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should maintain friendly relations with Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is now pre-eminent in Central and Western Arabia; his territories not only have long, open desert frontiers with territories for the welfare of which His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible, but occupy a key position on the route to India, South-Eastern Asia and Australia. The proposed British strategic air route by the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf would cross an important stretch of Nejdli territory. Ibn Saud, moreover, holds an important situation in the eyes of many millions of Moslem British subjects as being one of the most powerful independent Moslem rulers in the world, and as keeper of the Holy Places of Islam. Any deterioration of our relations with him would produce an immediate adverse reaction on Moslem opinion in India and elsewhere. His Majesty&apos;s Government also have an important practical interest in ensuring that the great numbers of Moslem British subjects who undertake the annuai pilgrimage to Mecca do so under favourable conditions.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have a direct interest in the maintenance of peace between Ibn Saud and his northern neighbours, Iraq and Transjordan. Unfortunately, considerable personal antipathy exists between ibn Saud and the rulers of these territories, King Feisal and the Emir Abdulla, whose father, King Hussein, he expelled from the Hejaz in 1925. As a result, however, of much patient diplomacy, and following on the suppression by Ibn Saud (with the indirect assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government) of a serious rebellion in North-Eastern Nejd in 1929, a personal meeting between Ibn Saud and King Feisal took place on board a British warship, under the auspices of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, in February 1930. The meeting was on the whole successful. Arrangements were made for the formal recognition of King Ibn Saud by King Feisal and a &quot; Bon-Voisinage &quot; Agreement, providing for the rapid settlement of frontier difficulties, was discussed. The improvement in relations between the two States, which resulted from this meeting, has been carried a step further by a visit which the Iraqi Prime Minister paid to King Ibn Saud at Mecca in April 1931. During this visit the &quot;Bon-Voisinage &quot; Agreement was signed, an Extradition Treaty concluded, and a settlement reached on a number of outstanding questions.(b) A si?1.In October 1926, by the Treaty of Mecca, the Idrisi of Asir accepted the suzerainty of Ibn Saud. Prior to this arrangement His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had regarded themselves as bound by two treaties, concluded during the war, to defend the Idrisi&apos;s territory from external aggression, although it was held that this engagement did not apply to aggression from another Arabian ruler. As a result of a further arrangement between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi at the end of 1930, the latter&apos;s territories have become, from the international standpoint, an integral part of Ibn Saud&apos;s dominions. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that so long as this remains the case, the Idrisi cannot claim the benefits of his treaties with His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) Relations with Italy in regard to the Arabian Coast of the Red Sea.In order to bring to an end a situation which was developing dangerous possibilities, the late Sir Gilbert Clayton was despatched to Rome in February 1927 to attempt an agreement with the Italian Government for regulating Anglo-Italian relations on the eastern coast of the Red Sea. As a result of this mission, it was agreed to be in the interest of the British and Italian Govern -
ments to pursue a policy of pacification in Western Arabia, and that such influence as the two Governments might be in a position to exercise with the rulers of the Hejaz, of Asir and of the Yemen should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict, in order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs. It was further recognised that the guiding principle of British policy in the Red Sea was the security of Imperial communications wdth India and the East, and that for this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded it as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, and more particularly on Karnaran Island or the Farsan Islands, and that these islands should not fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. Similarly, it was agreed to be the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast of the Red Sea, that no European Power should establish itself on&quot; the Arabian shore of the Red Sea or on the islands mentioned. It was agreed, however, that the British administration of Kamaran, an important quarantine station in connexion with the pilgrimage to Mecca, should continue, in view of the predominance of British pilgrims using the station.(d) Kotveit, Bahrein, El Qatr, Trucial Sheikhdoms, Mxiscat and Oman.As explained in connexion with Persia, the British position in the Persian Gulf was examined in 1928-29 by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which reached the conclusion that the maintenance of British supremacy in that area was, if anything, more essential to the security of India and to Imperial interests at the present time than in the past, and that, on the Arabian littoral, we should retain the status quo in its entirety. On the Arabian littoral of the Gulf the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is governed by a series of treaties placing under British protection the territories of the rulers of Koweit, Bahrein, El Qatr, the Trucial Sheikhs, and, for practical purposes, Muscat and Oman, the independence of which, however, Great Britain and France jointly guarantee to respect. The degree of protection varies. Protection from aggression by sea is guaranteed to all the States in question except Muscat, either explicitly, or as to the Trucial Sheikhs by implication. To the Sheikhdom of El Qatr His Majesty&apos;s Government have, in addition, promised &quot;good offices&quot; in the event of aggression by land. In the case of Koweit, a guarantee of unqualified &quot;protection&quot; has been given, but it is open to argument whether this extends to the principality of Kowreit or only to Koweit town. In the case of Muscat, the guarantees given do not in terms go beyond the towns of Muscat and Mattra, but in practice the State could hardly stand without British support.It has been possible in the past to implement our obligations in this area with relatively small expense and difficulty. During the past year His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have, however, been involved in operations in Koweit against the rebellious Akhwan subjects of Ibn Saud. These have now been subdued and peace restored, but relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud have yet to be placed on a thoroughly satisfactory footing.The obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and towards certain of the Trucial Sheikhs may also affect the situation as between Great Britain and Persia, since Persia has recently revived obsolete historical claims to suzerainty over Bahrein and to certain islands which His Majesty&apos;s Government have long recognised as the property of the Trucial Sheikhs.No intervention of importance has taken place or is immediately probable elsewhere on the Arab littoral of the Gulf, though it has been necessary in the past few months to carry out punitive measures against the local Sheikh of Khassab, who had rebelled against his overlord, the Sultan of Muscat, and the possibility of intervention at some later date (on a scale relatively very small) to support tine authority of the Sultan of Muscat at Sur cannot be excluded. Minor difficulties, too, may arise should it be necessary to apply pressure to the Trucial Sheikhs in connexion with the laying out of the protected strategic air route. Broadly speaking, however, it may be said that there is no immediate probability that the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in this area as a whole will involve them in any operation of a major character.
(4) Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine, the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate.British policy and commitments in regard to Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine, and in regard to the Aden Protectorate and its relations with the independent Imamate (or Kingdom) of the Yemen fall primarily within the sphere of the Colonial Office.(5) Afghanistan.Since the third Afghan war in 1919 His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India have been under no obligation to Afghanistan to defend any of the frontiers of that country, but early in 1928 the Committee of Imperial Defence reaffirmed the cardinal &quot;principle laid down by earlier committees in 1903 and 1907 that &quot; By our own plain interest, our obligations to guard the independence and integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired, and the deliberate crossing of the Oxus, or the occupation of Herat by Russia, would be the violation of a frontier which we are bound to defend,&quot;and that &quot;In the last resort, Russian action of the kind indicated would be followed by a declaration of war against that Power.&quot;The Committee left for further consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India the question cf the steps to be taken to place the army and Royal Air Force in India in the state of preparedness required by this policy.The formula which the Committee of Imperial Defence suggested should, if necessary, be used in explaining this policy was :  &quot; Great Britain could never regard with indifference the interference by a foreign Power in the existing territory of a friendly Afghanistan, but the exact steps which ought, in that event, to be taken must depend upon the circumstances of the moment.&quot;No occasion for making a public pronouncement in these terms has so far arisen, but the Afghan Government recently asked point blank what the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in the event of Soviet aggression, and the reply will possibly follow the lines of the formula. From the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is of the highest importance that the Afghan Government should not derive the impression that they can provoke the Soviet Government with impunity, and that, if they do so, they will be protected from the consequences.Afghanistan was one of the countries which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had in mind when reserving their right to defend their special interests in certain unspecified regions of the world prior to the signature in August 1928 of the International Treaty for the Renunciation of War, this reservation being contained in paragraph 10 of their note of the 19th May and paragraph 7 of that of the 18th July to the United States Government, both of which Avere subsequently made public. One of the last acts of King Amanullah&apos;s Government, before the rebellion in November 1928, was to adhere to this treaty, to which Afghanistan, in consequence, became a party when the treaty became effective on the 24th July, 1929.Afghanistan is not at present a member of the League of Nations, but the Afghan Government recently asked His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul to furnish them with information about the League. If they decide to apply for membership, His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India will be prepared, apart from major changes in Anglo-Afghan relations, to support their candidature.In spite of violent attacks in a section of the Indian press and continual alarms arising out of the movements and supposed projects of Amanullah Khan, King Nadir Shah is slowly consolidating his position, and the loan and gift of arms which he received in two instalments in 1930 and early 1931, from His
Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India have undoubtedly been of great assistance to him in doing so. His relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government are good, and even cordial, though somewhat clouded by the inability of the Government of India, prior to the recent enactment of an Ordinance for the purpose, to control the propaganda campaign against him. He has, furthermore, at the risk of much unpopularity, behaved with correctness in the matter of the frontier tribes. For the rest, he has sufficient judgment and knowledge of the outer world to realise that it is in the interests of Afghanistan to maintain friendly relations with Great Britain and India, and that the latter have a genuine interest in desiring the strength and unity of Afghanistan. The repetition of any such obvious folly as the Third Afghan War is consequently most improbable. But however sincere may be the King&apos;s desire for good relations and however clearly he may see that Afghan interests require the maintenance of British power in India as a counterpoise to the Soviet Union, it cannot be assumed that he would be able to follow his inclinations in the event of any really serious trouble in India; especially as his personal position is not yet so secure as to enable him to disregard the pressure to fish in troubled waters which would be brought to bear upon him from many interested quarters.As for the Soviet Government, their policy can only be conjectured, but they seem to aim at extending Soviet influence in Asiatic countries with the&apos;ultimate object of securing their spontaneous adhesion to the Soviet Union, rather than at extending the frontiers of the Union by force of arms. It may also be assumed that they would not regard the conquest of Afghanistan as practicable, so long, at any rate, as they have to reckon on the possibility of British help from India in defending that country, and so long as this possibility is not discounted by wide-spread rebellion in India itself. It might, indeed, be comparatively easy by intrigue or aggression to detach the northern Afghan provinces, where the races are akin to those of the neighbouring Soviet Republics, but such a step would only serve to antagonise the more independent and warlike inhabitants of Central and Southern Afghanistan, namely, the Hazaras and the Pathan tribes south of the Hindu Rush. Moreover, the sovietisation of India must presumably seem a much greater prize than anything to be gained in Afghanistan; and assuming this to be an object of Soviet policy, the Soviet Government are unlikely to risk antagonising India&apos;s most important neighbour by schemes of dismemberment or by open aggression. On the whole, it seems logical that the Soviet Government should aim for the present at maintaining Afghanistan as a united and independent State, and at winning her friendship in the hope of making her a base either for open intervention in India if the moment arrived or at least for further intrigue in that country.The behaviour of the Soviet Government during the last few7 years has been m accordance with a policy of this kind, but it does not follow that they might not use their influence to replace a ruler who seemed to them unduly pro-British by one whom they might expect to find more complaisant, for instance, Amanullah Khan. The Afghan Government are, in fact, convinced that the Soviet Govern-ment have made some secret arrangement with the ex-King, and it is generally rumoured that he has received financial assistance from them.In these circumstances it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give King Nadir Shah assistance by all practicable means in the consolidation of his personal position and the reorganisation of his country, to maintain friendly and close relations with the Afghan Government and to encourage that Government to maintain correct relations with the Soviet Government.7.-ASIA (THE FAR EAST). (1) China.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have continued to follow,, in regard to China, the policy of conciliation and of concessions to the aspirations of Chinese nationalism which was defined and accepted by the eight Powers repre-senting (with the Soviet Union, which is not a signatory) the great majority of foieign interests in that country in the Washington treaty of February 1922 relating to principles and policies concerning China.   This policy was set out
more specifically from the individual standpoint of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the well-known British offer to China of January 1927. It is designed to stabilise conditions in the Far East, to safeguard the rights and interests of China, and to promote intercourse between China and other Powers on the basis of equality of opportunity. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed with China and with other Powers : (1) To respect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial andadministrative integrity of China. (2) To provide the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to China todevelop and maintain for herself an effective and -stable Government. (3) To use their influence for the purpose of effectually establishing and main-taining the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce andindustry of all nations throughout the territory of China. (4) To refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seekspecial rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjectsor citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimicalto the security of such States.It is, moreover, an axiom of our policy in China that co-operation should, so far as is possible, be maintained with other foreign Powers having interests in that country.The offer spontaneously made in 1927 demonstrated the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to surrender in due time the great majority of the special privileges enjoyed in the past by British nationals in China and stigmatised as &quot; unequal &quot; by the Chinese. Subsequent negotiations with the National Government of China have led to agreement being reached, in harmony with the Washington Treaty and the offer of 1927, on numerous questions of fundamental importance. The period which has elapsed since the last review of foreign policy has been especially fruitful. The leased territory of Weihaiwei and the former British concessions at Chinkiang and Ariioy have been surrendered to China, while the Boxer indemnity question has been settled by an agreement providing for the remission to China of all payments made or to be made by her after the date of her entry into the war in 1917, the major part of the funds so remitted to be spent on material produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom and destined for the rehabilitation of railways and other productive enterprises in China.As regards extra-territoriality, His Majesty&apos;s Government, at the end of 1929, agreed that the 1st January, 1930, should be treated as the date from which the process of the gradual abolition of extra-territoriality should be regarded as having commenced in principle. Since then, negotiations in detail have been opened and have made very considerable progress. They are still being actively pursued. Owing to the complicated nature of this question and to the important effect that a settlement concluded between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Chinese Government would have on the interests of other friendly Powers, these negotiations are especially difficult, but the hope is entertained that a satisfactory treaty may shortly be concluded with China providing for the partial surrender of the extra-territorial privileges enjoyed by His Majesty&apos;s subjects in China in return for the establishment of an irreducible minimum of safeguards. In the meanwhile, British subjects in China have been advised to pay regular and non-discriminatory Chinese taxation, whether national or municipal.It has not yet been possible to conclude a treaty of commerce and navigation, and negotiations have made no real progress owing to the desire of the Chinese Government first to settle the question of extra-territoriality, which necessarily affects the terms of a commercial treaty. Agreement on the difficult and complicated problem of the status of Shanghai remains for the future. The foreign communities and the Municipal Council of the International Settlement have evidently recognised their duty to contribute of their own accord towards this evolution in a sense more acceptable to Chinese nationalism of the corporate life of the city. The number of Chinese councillors has been increased from three to five out of a total of fourteen, and the municipal council have made an ex gratia payment of some  15,000 to the relatives of Chinese killed in the incident of the 30th May, 1925, thus, it is hoped, rendering it possible that a rankling memory should pass into oblivion.   They have further sought the
counsel of a distinguished South African judge, Mr. Justice Feetham, well known for his handling of the Irish Free State-Northern Ireland boundary question, with a view to reconciling the interests of foreigners and natives in the richest city in China. Judge Feetham has just completed an exhaustive report on Shanghai; the first volume, dealing with the history of the Inter-national Settlement, has already been published and is of great interest; the second volume, which will contain Judge Feetham&apos;s considered recommendations regarding the future administration of the city, is awaited with still greater interest, and will no doubt carry great weight.During the period under review the internal and external difficulties facing the National Government of China have not, on the Avhole, diminished. At the end of 1929 the Chinese Government, in pursuance of their nationalistic policy, determined to regain full control of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and carried out a coup de main which amounted to an open breach of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924 providing for joint control of the line. Hostilities were subsequently opened, and lasted for some months; though desultory and hardly of the nature of organised warfare, they were sufficient to establish the impotence of the Chinese forces to withstand adversaries of any real military value. They ended in the complete defeat of the Chinese troops, and the Chinese Government were obliged to accept in December 1929 terms of settlement of the status of the railway dictated by the Soviet Union.    ;There are indications (though as yet indefinite) that the Chinese Government are now turning their attention towards the Japanese-controlled South Manchurian Railway, and that if they pursue a similar policy to that which they previously followed with regard to the Chinese Eastern Railway, they Avill run the risk of an equally severe rebuff at the hands of Japan. But the method which seems likely to be pursued is one of building other railways which may tend to squeeze out the Japanese railway. There may, however, turn out to be room for all these railways, and a direct attack on the South Manchurian Railway seems on the whole unlikely.As regards internal affairs, a civil war on a great scale, with heavy losses on both sides, raged in the North for several months in 1930 and Avas ended in favour of the National Government, not by a decisive military victory but by the interArention of the Governor of Manchuria, the &quot;Young Marshal&quot; Chang Hsueh-liang, who thereby acquired a personal position which may prove to be of great political moment in the future. During the ciAul Avar &quot; Red Partisan &quot; detachments, formerly regarded as criminals rather than revolutionaries, made themselves masters of considerable areas in no less than seven provinces in the south and south-east, and their activities were proved to be connected and to share a common purpose with those of the Chinese Communist party. When the civil war in the North came to an end, Government forces were despatched to cope with this menace; but they had made little progress when a new movement against the National GoArernment broke out in Canton, the extreme wing of the Kuomintang associating itself with this movement, as it had Avith the earlier rebellion in the North. A number of southern provinces have, in theory, seceded from Nanking, but the movement does not seem as yet to constitute a serious threat to the National Government. It is directed rather against the personal ascendency of Chiang Kai-shek than the National Government as such. The presence of large numbers of troops of doubtful allegiance in numerous districts of the country leaves, however, ample scope for unforeseen developments, and debars the National Government from despatching the whole of its troops of assured loyalty to any given area, however seriously the situation there may deArelop. The precise nature and extent of the Southern movement are still obscure at the time of writing, but it is clear that the anti-bandit campaign has. for the time being at least, been abandoned.These matters require to be mentioned here in order that another aspect of His Majesty&apos;s Government to China policy may be shown in a true light. His Majesty&apos;s Government have refused to allow themselves to be restrained by the internal and external difficulties of the Chinese GoArernment from carrying out the liberal policy indicated above. It is, nevertheless, their plain duty to-recognise that these difficulties exist, and that British subjects and interests in China are adversely affected by them. The National Government cannot but be regarded as the mouthpiece of the aspirations of the Chinese people, so far
as the position of foreigners in their country, is concerned; but it is equally certain that the National Government are unable to discharge another function of Government, that of effectively controlling the country, or even the greater part of it, and of effectively protecting foreigners engaged in lawful pursuits. Instances of this fact have not been lacking during the period under review, for several British subjects have lost their lives in circumstances proving beyond doubt the inability of the National Government to exercise even the shadow of control over given areas of the country. It is, therefore, incumbent on His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it is not incompatible with their general policy, to maintain armed forces in China in order to afford to some at least of His Majesty&apos;s subjects residing there a greater measure of security than the government of the soil is able to provide unaided. It should be added that a resolution adopted by the Washington Conference of 1921-22 provides that these and other foreign forces will be withdrawn whenever China shall assure the protection of the lives and property of foreigners in China, This condition has certainly not been realised, and the reasons for the retention of British troops in China therefore remain in force. The garrison has, however, been still further reduced during the period under review, and now consists of only six battalions, one at Tientsin, two at Shanghai and three at Hong Kong, two of the latter being available in emergency for reinforcing the Shanghai Defence Force.&apos; It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to withdraw the Shanghai Defence Force as soon as circumstances allow, and thereafter to maintain sufficient troops at Hong Kong to obviate the necessity of sending reinforcements from England should another emergency arise. In view of the serious likelihood of such an emergency arising from the unpredictable vicissitudes of civil war, it is plain that a further reduction of the China garrison could not at present be undertaken without exposing British lives and interests to serious danger. With regard to the naval arm, the Commander-in-chief ii\ China has standing instructions authorising him to take immediate retaliatory action in the event of outrages which (1) endanger the lives of British nationals, or (2) endanger British property, when there is actual deliberate and wanton destruction of property.(2) Japan.According to public statements frequently made in Japan the lapse of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has made little difference between the two countries. The two questions which might be said to disturb though not to any serious: degree the cordial relations which exist between Great Britain and Japan are-Singapore and immigration. The former is at the moment dormant, and so also is the latter, except for periodical outbursts. At the present moment the Japanese public are resenting the adverse criticism in South Africa of the recently-concluded agreement with the Union Government, by which extended facilities are being recorded to Japanese traders and students entering the Union. The unfortunate aspect of this matter is that up to date the United States have been the chief butt for Japanese ill-humour on the immigration question, and it is possible that an increased share of the odium may now fall on Great Britain.Close co-operation has been maintained between the Japanese and the British Legations at Peking, and the Japanese are undoubtedly pleased with the manner in which Sir Miles Lampson has kept them informed of current negotiations in China affecting the common interests of both peoples. On one or two occasions His Majesty&apos;s Minister has even acted as a conciliator in the difficult negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese. Partly as a result of this, Sino-Japanese relations improved. All Japanese troops were moved from Shantung in May 1929; anti-Japanese boycotts came to an end, and a definite tariff agreement was signed between Japan and China, which came into force in May 1930.In Manchuria the Japanese maintained an outward policy of strict neutrality in the Sino-Soviet dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway. They realised, however, that a Chinese success would eventually embolden the latter to make an attempt on the South Manchurian Railway, and for this reason they possibly supported the side of the U.S.S.R., who in this case were the paradoxical and unabashed upholders of &quot; capitalist&quot; interests. The Japanese received coldly the invitation of the United States to join in representations to the Soviet and Chinese Governments, reminding them of their obligations under the Treaty
for the Renunciation of War, knowing that the Soviet Union at any rate would resent such a step, and being fully determined that if any country were to inter-vene, it must only be Japan. The Japanese were grateful to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for not pushing the American proposal in such a way as to oblige them to take action which might have led to embarrassing possibilities.There have been indications that the Japanese are prepared to discuss outstanding questions regarding railways in Manchuria with the Chinese in a reasonable spirit.   They do not, however, wish outside countries to interfere inany way.There has recently been friction between Japan and.the U.S.S.R. over several matters in Siberia, the renewal of the fishery leases, the closure of the Vladisvostok branch of the Chosen Bank on account of a dispute over the exchange rates of the rouble, and the attempted murder of a member of the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese showed marked forbearance in the handling of these questions which have now either been settled or are well on the way towards settlement. There no longer appears to be any anxiety that Japanese-Soviet relations will become further embittered as a result of these disputes.The Japanese Government, after some internal political trouble, ratified the London Naval Treaty. During the negotiations in London the Japanese delegates showed evidence of a genuine desire to arrive at a favourable solution, and co-operated whole-heartedly with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States with this&apos; object in view.The visit of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu and Princess Takamatsu in June 1930 was ostensibly a return for the Duke of Gloucester^ visit to Japan the previous year to bestow the Order of the Garter on the Emperor of Japan.   The visit was an unqualified success.8.-AMERICA. (1) United States.Anglo-United States Relations as they stand to-day.The signature on the 22nd April, 1930, of the London Naval Treaty may be said to have marked the end of a difficult phase in Anglo-United States relations. This unpleasant stage became perceptible in 1924, wdien propaganda for cruiser expansion attained noticeable dimensions and reached its most acute stage on the 11th November, 1928, when President Coolidge, irritated by the failure of the Geneva jNaval Conference in 1927 and by the so-called Anglo-French compromise of the following year, delivered his sour speech about &quot; drum-beats of a new7 destiny,&quot; which roused a wide echo of criticism, particularly in Great Britain. This oration served, however, a useful purpose, for, while it was acclaimed with approval by most of the United States press, wdiich has a habit of reacting favourable to xenophobia on the part of the country&apos;s leaders, there is no doubt that it concentrated the attention of thoughtful and influential elements upon foreign questions with special reference to the deterioration of Anglo-United States relations. The atmosphere was therefore ripe for a constructive policy on the part of the new President when he assumed his high office in March. Mr. Hoover acted promptly, for in the following month Mr. Gibson, the United States Ambassador to Belgium, made at the meeting of the Preparatory Commis-sion at Geneva his &quot; naval yard-stick &quot; proposals wdiich paved the way for the subsequent informal negotiations between the Prime Minister, General Dawes and Mr. Hoover, and led eventually to the London Naval Conference. Without doubt the most important feature of the informal negotiations that took place before the conference met on the 21st January, 1930, was the first paid in the first part of October by the Prime Minister to the United States where Mr. MacDonald was able to discuss personally and most frankly with Mr. Hoover various aspects of Anglo-American relations. The Prime Ministers visit was warmly welcomed by official and public opinion in the United States, upon which it created the most favourable impression, thereby putting the seal upon his earlier conversations with the United States Ambassador in London.
This is not the place to examine in detail the results of the conference. It is greatly to be hoped that the further negotiations which have taken place with. British co-operation between France and Italy will reach a satisfactory conclusion. The agreement already reached between the British Commonwealth, of Nations, the United States and Japan, and rendered possible by the reduction, below the 1927 figures of British cruiser requirements, consequent upon the well-nigh universal acceptance by the nations of the world of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War, on the one hand, and the modification of the hitherto uncompromising United States insistence upon nothing but 8-inch-gun cruisers on the other, has already exerted a happy influence upon the relations between the countries concerned. It disposes of naval competition between them, while it is not too much to hope that it will powerfully assist the general cause of disarmament.It is not intended that the foregoing should convey the impression that, as a result of the naval treaty, Great Britain and the United States will henceforth find themselves in agreement on other problems, and, indeed, any such facile assumption is to be avoided.  Memories in the United States are very short, and, as we have seen to our cost in such questions as naval disarmament, oil resources and rubber restriction, public opinion in that country is susceptible of being swayed by unfriendly propaganda and catchwords.  There are not a few matters which, if not carefully handled, hold seeds of trouble, such as, to mention only two, shipping and tariff policies.   As regards the former, the passage in June 1928 of the United States Merchant Marine Act of that year, with its artificial protection for the national shipping industry in the shape of large State loans for shipbuilding and entirely uneconomic payments for the carriage of mails, has added considerably to United States marine competition, from which hardly any trade route is now exempt.   As regards the latter, the new Tariff Bill, with its striking increase in duties already the highest in the world, has caused the liveliest resentment abroad, and has, indeed, led to demands for retaliation of one sort or another.   Nevertheless, while making allowances for these and other problems, and for such imponderabilia as the narrow, nationalistic, and only too often aggressive, outlook of political and commercial elements in the United States, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that to-day, on the morrow of the signature of the London Naval Treaty, official and public sentiment in that country is more favourable to Great Britain than has been the case at any time since the war.   There is less suspicion of our motives, more understanding of the foreign, imperial and domestic problems with which we are confronted, and more realisation of the fact that Great Britain and the United States, two great merchant peoples, are at one in their desire, both for idealistic and for practical reasons, to promote the establishment and maintenance of international peace upon a secure and lasting basis.   It should be added that the year 1930 found the United States in the grip of an economic depression of unexampled magnitude, wrhich has resulted in widespread distress throughout the country and unemployment, totalling at a conservative estimate probably not less than 6 million men and women.   These adverse conditions, following so rapidly upon the extraordinary prosperity which endured from 1922 until the Stock Exchange collapse in 1929, have served not only to concentrate the attention of the American public more than ever upon their own internal problems, but have also had a profound psychological effect in shattering the illusion that the United States were wiser and better than foreign peoples.   This appears to have modified the somewhat aggressive tendencies of the Government and public.It must be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to continue the policy they have consistently followed with beneficial results during the last decade of promoting friendly relations with the United States of America. This policy has not entailed, and does not call for, the sacrifice of any essential British interest. It does, however, demand the exercise of much patience, and progress is likely to be slow. Thus, there is as yet no prospect of the United States being willing to participate in matters with which they are not directly concerned, such as European affairs, nor is there as yet any tangible evidence that United States public opinion has become reconciled to any implementing of the Kellogg Pact or other assumption of responsibility for the preservation of peace. But if the United States Government and people can be persuaded that Great Britain is pursuing a sane, constructive and progressive [5504] &apos; H
world policy, that, in a word, her attitude contrasts favourably with the mutual antagonisms, fears and suspicions of the continental Powers, it will be possible for this country virtually to ensure that the immense political and economic influence of the United States is utilised to the best effect, and incidentally to our advantage.United States Proposal for an Arbitration Treaty.The Root-Bryce Arbitration Treaty of 1908 expired on the 4th June, 1928, and so far no decision has been reached on the proposals made by Mr. Kellogg on the 29th December, 1927, for a new arbitration treaty to replace that instrument. In considering the United States draft difficulties were encountered in connexion with the omission of the &quot;vital interests&quot; clause, the absence of which would include within the scope of the treaty disputes arising from the exercise of maritime belligerent rights. It is, however, now generally agreed that it would be inadvisable to attempt to secure the insertion of the clause in question. A more serious objection to the United States draft lies in its stipulation that the &quot;special agreement,&quot; wdiich is to settle the terms of reference relating to a dispute to be submitted to arbitration, must in each case be made &apos;&apos; with the advice and consent of the Senate.&quot; This one-sided arrangement gives the United States a considerable advantage, because the Senate could in practice render the arbitration treaty nugatory, in the event of a dispute which it did not Avish to see referred to arbitration, by the simple expedient of rejecting or radically amending the relevant special agreement.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had reached no decision on this and other points relating to the United States proposals at the time of the dissolution in the spring of 1929, and subsequently further delay occurred, as it was considered desirable to concentrate first upon the important naval negotiations and also to await final action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments in regard to the Optional Clause. Nothing has, however, been heard during the last few months of the United States proposals and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not themselves intend to raise the matter unless or until the United States Government should return to the charge.Questions affecting Anglo-United States Relations that may become active. Belligerent Rights.The action Avhich it was found necessary to take during the blockade of Germany against neutral ships and cargoes was nowhere more bitterly resented than in the United States, whose subsequent participation in the war and co-operation in the blockade in no wise eradicated the unpleasant memories of 1915 and 1916. During the last ten years these recollections of the alleged illegalities perpetrated against United States trade have been exploited to the utmost by the proponents of naval expansion in that country, in order to mobilise public support for their policy; and at the same time the lawyers have not been backward in manoeuvring for the questions at issue to be submitted for arbitration. In 1925 it became apparent that the United States Government were con-contemplating the presentation of a large number of so-called claims against Great Britain arising from the detention of United States merchant vessels and cargoes during the blockade of Germany. By making it clear to the United States Govern-menfr that any such action, coming on top of their war debt policy, would be definitely detrimental to the relations between the two countries, it was found possible to persuade them to agree to a careful joint examination of all these alleged claims, Avhich revealed that they amounted to very little. In 1926 negotiations Avere carried on quietly and without &amp;nj measure of publicity, Avhich led to the removal of the menace provided by the possible presentation of &quot;blockade&quot; claims and the mutual settlement of many other claims, without either Government being called upon to make any actual payment to the other.This satisfactory settlement did nothing, however, to cool the frenzy of the &quot; Big Navy &quot; party, Avho loudly proclaimed that, in the light of the failure of the United States Government to obtain any satisfaction as a result of their
vehement protests during the first two and a half years of the war, they were in the position of the general who marched his men up the hill and then marched them down again. Senator Borah and other politicians then entered the scene, and in 1927 and 1928 there seemed some possibility that the United States Govern-ment would be pressed into calling a conference for the codification of maritime law-. There are grounds for supposing that at about this time the Navy Depart-ment, envisaging the likelihood of getting practically all they wanted in the way of increased strength, and realising that on every occasion in which the United States have faced a national emergency (i.e., the Civil and Great Wars) they have applied belligerent rights to the fullest extent, took fright over the enthusiasm of the intelligentsia and secured a diminution of this propaganda. Information secured during the Naval Conference indicates that the present United States Administration are not in favour of raising the belligerent rights issue, although the subject was mentioned by President Hoover in his conversations with the Prime Minister in Washington in October 1929. It was then that we first heard of Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposal for the immunity of food ships, which was subsequently made publicly in his Armistice Day speech of that year, and again in 1930. There is reason to suppose that the United States President honestly believed this suggestion would be helpful to Great Britain in assuring her food supplies in times of emergency. Unfortunately, however, there is.no indication that if it were accepted the United States would agree to join in action against any Power that attacked food ships as hospital ships wrere attacked in the late war.It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to refrain, if possible, from being drawm into discussions with the United States on belligerent rights, and so far this attitude has been successfully maintained. While there is ground for hoping that the recent Naval Agreement between the tw7o countries wall ease the situation, it would be rash to assume that nothing more will be heard in the United States of the question. The most that can be said is that the present Administration, unless its hand is forced by some strong movement in public opinion, is unlikely to take the initiative in raising this issue. In any event, no change could be made in the present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom without careful consultation with His His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions. Of late nothing has been heard on the subject.West Indian Bases.For years more or less active propaganda has been carried on in the United States against the British West Indian Colonies, on the hypothesis that these islands menace the approaches to the Panama Canal and thereby constitute a threat to the United States. The proponents of naval expansion have meticulously avoided any explanation of the important fact that such dockyard facilities and coast defences as exist at Bermuda and Jamaica are on a very.minor scale, and that the garrison of the Colonies consist of one battalion of British infantry (two companies at Bermuda and two companies at Jamaica) stationed there primarily for the preservation of order, some artillery and other details, and coloured police. In this, as in other matters, however, the colossal ignorance of the United States public in regard to foreign nations and their responsibilities and policies militates against the maintenance of a reasonable attitude; that some apprehensions do exist in the public mind on the score of our West Indian defences is shown by Mr. Hoover&apos;s references to these &quot;bases&quot; during his conversations of 1929 with the Prime Minister, when it was suggested that, in return for an American official assurance that these stations are not considered in their present state to constitute any appreciable menace to the United States, Great Britain should declare that she has no intention of fortifying them in the future in such a wray as to become a menace to the United States.No action was taken at the time, but it is not unlikely that more will be heard of the matter. It is to be remembered that any appreciable strengthening of the present West Indian defences (other than by reinforcing the troops in the event of some local emergency) would arouse much unfriendly criticism in the United States and might seriously strain Anglo-American relations.
(2) Mexico.After fifteen years of constant disorder and upheaval, Mexico acquired in 1925, under the regime of Senor Calles, a certain stability, precariously maintained until 1929, in spite of acute dissensions between Church and State and labour organisations and agrarians. These culminated in the spring of that year in a well-organised revolutionary movement, but the Government proved strong enough to crush the rising completely. Since then the Government has -consolidated its position, notably by -effecting a settlement of the conflict between Church and State, and Mexico to-day offers a better prospect of more settled conditions in the future than at any moment in the past twenty years.Normal diplomatic relations between Great Britain and Mexico were resumed in 1925. but they cannot be considered as satisfactory so long as Mexico continues to make no effort either to meet the very substantial claims of British subjects and enterprises or to display the slightest friendliness for this country. One of the main objects of British policy in Mexico is to reach a settlement of the claims.Relations between Mexico and the United States of America improved remarkably after the appointment of Mr. Morrow as Ambassador at Mexico City.   Mr. Morrow has since been succeeded by Mr. Reuben J. Clark.(3) South and Central America.Relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the South and Central American States are friendly, and no question exists nor is likely to arise in this sub-continent involving the possibility of war with this country. It is the policy of His Majesty&quot; s Government in the United Kingdom, in view of the rapidly growing economic importance of South America, to foster these relations to the best of their power.Early in 1931 His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Prince George, visited Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina (where he opened the successful British Empire Exhibition), Uruguay and Brazil and was everywhere received with the utmost friendliness. It maybe hoped that His Royal Highness&apos;s initiative may effectively stimulate the interest of British manufacturers in the opportunities which await them in South America. The only outstanding political question in this sphere is that of a claim by Argentina to sovereignty over the whole group of the Falkland Islands and a more precise one to the South Orkneys. A meteorological station originally set up on the latter by a British subject has been maintained since 1905 by the Argentine Government. In 1925 a wireless station was added to the observatory and the Argentine Government refused to take out a British licence and call signal for the station, claiming the islands as Argentine territory. In December 1927 the Argentine Government, in response to a circular letter from the International Postal Bureau at Berne, formally declared that Argentine territorial jurisdiction extended de jure and de facto over the South Orkney Islands and South Georgia and de jure over the Falkland Islands, de facto jurisdiction over the latter being prevented by British occupation.   The necessary corrective action was taken in Berne in 1928.Since then the question has lain dormant, but if it were raised again by Argentina, the first aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be to endeavour to avoid a reference to arbitration, which might be extended from the smaller issue of the South Orkneys to that of the whole group, and which could not fail to react disadvantageously on our valuable economic relations with Argentina.The possibility of internal hostilities in South America appears to be growing more remote. The long-standing Tacna-Arica dispute, which had divided Chile and Peru since 1879, has now been settled through the good offices of the United States of America, and both countries are displaying a marked spirit of friendliness.The incident involving armed conflict which occurred between Paraguay and Bolivia in December 1928 over the ill-defined frontier in the Chaco was liquidated by the Commission of Enquiry and Conciliation set up by the Pan-American Conference, and diplomatic relations between the two States have been resumed. The fundamental cause of the dispute, however a frontier which has never been accurately delimited still remains.
The world-wide depression of 1930 resulted in a wave of distress throughout Central and South America and revolutions occurred in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Panama, Peru and Santo-Domingo. These upheavals, which were comparatively bloodless, may be said to have redounded to our advantage in that the new Administrations arjpear less disposed than their predecessors to submit to United States influence and guidance.It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain the friendliest contact with the various republics of South and Central America, and when possible not to allow internal changes to affect their relations. When the present depression passes, the continent of South America will offer unrivalled oppor-tunities to British trade, and it is satisfactory to note that a greater measure of interest in Latin America is now being displayed by commercial interests than has been displayed for many years.9. ANTARCTICA.It will be remembered that the importance of the whaling industry in the Antarctic, as well as the desirability that it should be conducted under British auspices, led in 1908 to the creation of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. This &quot;was followed in 1923 by the formation of the Ross Sea Dependency, on the opposite side of the Antarctic Continent.In 1926, when the Imperial Conference met, the question of British claims in the Antarctic was one of the items on the agenda. The Committee of the Imperial Conference, which studied the question, recommended that the aim to be kept in view should be the establishment of British domination in the Antarctic. It was recognised that, if international complications were to be avoided, the process would necessarily be gradual, and the following three stages were recommended : (1) An intimation to the world at large, through the Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference, of the special British interest in certain areas (lying between the westward boundary of the Ross Dependency and the eastward boundary of the Falkland Islands Dependencies) to which a British title existed by virtue of discovery.(2) The despatch of an expedition under an officer specially authorised to take formal possession in the name of His Majesty of such of these areas as were known not to have been so taken possession of at the time of discovery.(3) The issue of Letters Patent formally annexing the territory of which possession had been taken and making provision for its government.The Committee&apos;s Report was approved by the Imperial Conference and in pursuance of (1) above the following paragraph appeared in the published Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference (Cmd. 2768, page 33) : &quot; The question of Antarctic exploration was discussed between repre-sentatives of the Governments interested.   There are certain areas in these regions to which a British title already exists by virtue of discovery.   these areas include &apos;&apos; (i) The outlying part of Coats Land, viz., the portion not comprisedwithin the Falkland Islands Dependencies. &quot; (ii) Enderby Land. &quot; (hi) Kemp Land. &apos;&apos; (iv) Queen Mary Land.&apos;&apos; (v) The area which lies to the west of Adelie Land and which on its discovery by the Australian Antarctic Expedition in 1912 was denominated by Wilkes Land. &quot; (vi) King George V Land. &quot; (vii) Gates Land.&quot; The representatives of the Governments concerned studied the information available concerning these areas with special reference to their possible utilisation for further developing exploration and scientific research in the Antarctic regions.&quot;Six of the seven areas referred to above lie to the south of, and are specially associated with, the Commonwealth of Australia, and it was contemplated at the Imperial Conference that, when the time came for the issue of Letters Patent,
their administration and control should be vested in His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth. The sector of the Antarctic Continent in which they lie (45Q E. to 160o E.) is commonly known therefore as the Commonwealth Sector and will hereafter be referred to by this description.In order to complete the second stage recommended at the Imperial Conference, it was decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia to equip an expedition under the leadership of Sir Douglas Mawson, who led the Australian expedition of 1911-14. To the cost of this expedition contributions were made by His Majesty&quot;s Governments in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.The expedition sailed from London in the &quot; Discovery &quot; on the 1st August,. 1929, and after operating throughout the season of 1929-30 in the western half of the Commonwealth Sector, revisited the Antarctic during the season 1930-31 with a view to completing the exploration of the eastern half of the sector. Sir Douglas Mawson was provided with a Royal Commission empowering him to take possession, in the name of His Majesty, of the six areas referred to above, and of any newr territory winch he might discover. The full report of the expedition has not yet been received, but it appears to have been highly successful and it is hoped that the results achieved will be such as to enable the third stage recommended by the Imperial Conference, 1926, to be undertaken, viz., the issue of Letters Patent formally annexing the sector (with the exception of the French territory of Adelie Land) and vesting the control of it in His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia.Apart from the ultimate annexation of the Commonwealth Sector, the Imperial Conference, 1926, contemplated that as opportunity offered : (a) the eastern boundary of the Falkland Islands Dependencies should be extended to embrace the whole of Coats Land; and (b) the western boundary of the Falkland Islands Dependencies and the eastern boundary of the Ross Dependency should be extended with a view to the absorption of the unexplored sector lying between the two territories. No action has so far been taken with regard to (a). As regards (b), it Avas hoped that progress might be made as a result of Sir Hubert Wilkins&apos;s aerial expeditions to the Falkland Islands Dependencies in 1928-29 and 1929-30. While, however, a number of important flights were carried out by these expeditions, mainly in the Falkland Islands Dependencies, it was not found possible for any descents to be made on land and adverse weather conditions precluded Sir H. Welkins from attempting a flight from the Falkland Islands Dependencies westward over the unexplored sector to the Ross Sea.The situation in the Antarctic w^as again reviewed by the Imperial Conference, 1930, which reaffirmed generally the policy outlined by the Imperial Conference. 1926.Claims by Foreign Poivers.Nonvegian Claims.With the lapse of German claims or territorial rights in the Antarctic after the wrar, the principal opposition to British territorial claims arises from the action of the Norwegian Government : (i) It will be remembered that, in 1925, the Norwegian Government hadprotested against any British annexation of the territory immediately circumjacent to the South Pole, as well as of territory on both sides of Captain Amundsen&apos;s route to the Pole south of King Edward VII Land, and including, inter alia, Queen Maud&apos;s Range (that is to say, within the Ross Sea Dependency, which is British territory). In 1927 the Norwegian Government returned to the charge in somewhat similar terms, and the controversy has not yet been settled, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom not having yet replied to the latest Norwegian note of the 8th November, 1929, regarding their claim in this particular sector, in the hopes that delay may be of assistance in finding some solution.(ii) The &quot; Norvegia &quot; expedition, sponsored by the Norwegian Government,which was operating in the South Atlantic in recent seasons has given rise to further Norwegian claims in the area between the Falkland Islands sector and the Australian sector, that is between Coats Land and Enderby Land.
10.-THE LEADING  COMMITMENTS ARISING OUT  OF  BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY IN ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE.1. The Covenant of the League of Nations, 1919.2. Membership of the Permanent Court of International Justice and acceptance of the Optional Clause. 3. Acceptance of the General Act (subject to certain reservations). 4. The Peace Treaties of 1919-20 (Versailles, Saint-Germain, Neuilly,Trianon). 5. The Treaty of Locarno, 1925.6. The Treaty of Paris for the Renunciation of War, 1928.7. The Washington Four-Power Treaty of 1921, whereby the BritishEmpire, France, Japan and the United States agreed mutually to respect their insular possessions in the Pacific. 8. The Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 regarding the integrity ofChina and the maintenance of the principle of equal opportunity forthe commerce of all nations. 9. Egypt.  The Declaration to Egypt of 1922. 10. The freedom of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, laid down in theStraits Convention of the Treaty of Lausanne, 1923. 11. Abyssinia.   Tripartite Agreement of 1906 to the effect that GreatBritain, France and Italy should co-operate in maintaining the actualpolitical and territorial status of Abyssinia.With a view to allaying friction with the Norwegian Government, as well as from a desire to reach a satisfactory agreement with Norway in regard to the important whaling industry, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom decided to waive the British claim to Bouvet Island, annexed by the &apos;&apos; Norvegia &apos;&apos; on her first expedition. Further, when the second &apos;&apos; Norvegia &apos;&apos; expedition, launched in 1928, proceeded to the Antarctic and annexed Peter I Island, it was decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government to raise no objection, and in December 1929 His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Oslo was instructed to intimate to the Norwegian Government that, while British territorial claims in the Antarctic in certain sectors, such as the Falkland Islands Dependencies, the Ross Sea Dependency, as well as the sector then being taken possession of by Sir Douglas Mawson, would be regarded as unimpeachable, a large sector of the Antarctic was still open, and in all the remainder under British sovereignty His Majesty&apos;s Governments would welcome Norwegian scientific and economic co-operation.The Argentine Claim to the South Orkneys.This claim, as a possible source of friction between the British and the Argentine Governments, has been discussed in the American section of this memorandum.United States Claims.The Antarctic expedition planned by Rear-Admiral Byrd, the well-known American aviator, took place in the season 1928-29, and made use of a base at the Bay of Whales, in the Ross Sea Dependency. In the course of some admirable flights from this base, Admiral Byrd appears to have discovered new territory to the east of King Edward VII Land, and, therefore, outside the eastern boundary of the Ross Sea Dependency, as well as new land to the east of Amundsen&apos;s route, in the course of the flight to and from the South Pole, but no detailed reports are yet available. The newspaper accounts, however, of Admiral Byrd&apos;s explorations caused considerable excitement in the American press, and reports were current that the United States Government intended to put forward an official claim for the territory discovered by this explorer. It appears, however, that there are two parties in the State Department in regard to American policy in the Antarctic, the first of which is in favour of pushing American claims, and the second for advocating a more prudent policy, and, from what has since occurred, it appears that the second party is at present in the ascendant.
