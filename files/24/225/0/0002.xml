(THIS IT)CUM3KT IS Tffii PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .AGRICULTURAL POLICY - THS HOME WHEAT 4U0TA. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.In accordance with Conclusion 4 of Cabinet 81(31), I am circulating herewith, for the information of my colleagues, an outline of the proposals for a Home &quot;Wheat Quota which I am about to discuss with the representatives of the principal organisations concerned.     My colleagues will, of course, realise that it may be necessary to make some modifications of detail in the plan in the light of these discussions.SECRET.CP.  302(31).CABINET.(Intld.)J.G.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 10, Whitehall Place, S.W. 1.1st December, 1931.
16Confidential * B.W.Q./1/12.British Wheat Quota Plan, 1951.Draft of a Plan for applying to millers and flour importers in this country the principle of a   quota&quot; of home-grown wheat.During the early summer of 1930, discussions took place at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries with representatives of the national organisations of farmers, flour millers, flour importers, com and agricultural merchants and wholesale and retail bakers and the consumers&apos; co-operative movement in order to ascertain the practicability of applying to flour millers and importers in this country the principle of a &quot;quota&quot; of home grown wheat.     The views and difficulties put forward in the various discussions were noted and exhaustively considered.   Subsequently, in consultation with representatives of the Board of Trade and the Board of Customs and Excise, a Plan designed to avoid the known difficulties was drawn up.   This Plan is administratively practicable and it is fundamental to it that it involves no charge upon the Exchequer in the payment of subsidies to wheat growers or other interests.The following is an outline of the main points of thePlan.1. The Minister prescribes the quota.The Minister will be empowered to prescribe a quota, variable from time to time, of British wheat of milling quality to be purchased (not necessarily used) by flour millers and flour importers.   The Minister&apos;s power to prescribe and maintain the quota will be exeroiseable only so long as the price of British wheat of milling quality does not exceed a figure to be stated in the Quota Act.   The amount of the quota is to be such as to absorb all the available supplies of wheat of home-grown milling quality in the course of a cereal year subject, if need be, to a maximum limit.
2. The Quota Certificate.Millers and flour importers will be required to surrender Quota certificates as documentary evidence of the fulfilment of their quota obligations.   The certificates will be issued by the Board (see below) through its agents. 3. A Controlling Organisation.A national organisation or board will be established, at first by the Minister but later by the growers themselves, under the Agricultural Marketing Act, to bo responsible, inter alia, for controlling sales of Quota wheat and for the creation and issue of Quota certificates in connection with such sales.The purpose of the Board would be to regulate the sales of wheat of milling quality through registered agents (approved com merchants) in such a way that the producers would secure a price approximating as closely as possible to the statutory maximum, and in so doing, to provide flour millers and importers with quota certificates originating with the initial sales of such wheat by the producers thereof.   The Board would thus be the instrument by which those farmers, who elect to register with the Board, would secure the price advantages intended in the Plan. 4. How the Plan would work.The object of the Board would be to operate with the minimum of disturbance of trading arrangements and accordingly to utilise existing marketing machinery as much as possible.   The methods of operation of a Board would, in very broad outline, be somewhat as follows:-(a) The Board would be mainly regulatory.   The Board would be mainly regulatory ice. non-trading, in character, but it would need to have in reserve the power to buy and sell Quota wheat to meet exceptional circumstances (see para.(g)).(b) Registered Agents.    It would operate through the agency of corn and agricultural merchants to or through whom the producers registered with the Board would be required to sell their wheat of milling quality for Quota purposes, the
13agency terras having been previously negotiated by the Board on behalf of producers.   It is not anticipated that producers need be tied in any way to a particular agent; business would be conducted, so far as possible, in the same way and by the same parties as at present.(c) Scale of Growers&apos; Prices.   A scale of growers&apos; prices would be drawn up (1) on the basis of quality and (ii) according to the time of year.   Registered producers would be informed of these prices.   The ascending seasonal scale would be designed to encourage a reasonable spread of deliveries by producers throughout the year.(d) Sales of Quota Wheat by the Agents.   The price at which agents would be instructed by the Board to sell would, so far as possible, be constant throughout the season and, subject to allowances for quality, would be the maximum prioe allowed by the Quota   Act.(e) The agents would sell wheat, acoompanied by quota certificates, to millers and flour importers who desired to purchase such wheat in fulfilment of quota obligations and to other persons who were prepared to pay the price. Copies of all quota certificates issued would be furnished by agents to the Board and to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.(f) Expenses of Board and its Agents.   The agents would deduct their agreed commission from the growers&apos;  scale price and remit to the Board the difference between the growers * price and the selling price;   out of these remittances, the Board would meet its expenses and also the cost of such bank credit as may be necessary to enable it to carry any surplus Qupta Certificates that may be issued with wheat marketed in the early months of the season until they are required by millers and flour importers later in the season, see (g) below.   Any surplus funds accumulated could be returnedto registered producers pro rata to sales.
19(g) Temporary purchases and storage by Board.   If fanners&apos; deliveries of wheat were at any time in excess of the amounts required to enable millers and flour importers to meet quota obligations, arrangements might be made by the Board to purchase the (temporary) surplus offered by farmers. The grain could either be stored until required or part could be re-sold by the Board&apos;s agents at the equivalent of the current United Kingdom price of comparable imported whei. and the accompanying certificates retained by the Board - such surplus Certificates being held in reserve for sale later by the Board or Its agents to millers and flour Importers.    It might, in fact, be desirable for the Board thus to accumulate a reserve of Certificates in order to meet unforeseen demands.(h) Farmers1 Credits.   In order to provide credit, where necessary, for farmers in respect of wheat to be delivered later in the season, the Board might be empowered to give its guarantee to charges created by registered producers under the Agricultural credits Act, 1928.(I) Circulation of Quota Certificates.   Quota certificates will pass through the agents, to millers and flour importers, each of whom will be required to produce and surrender, to the proper authority, certificates in sufficient quantity to discharge his quota obligations. This does not necessarily mean that a particular miller or flour importer will have physically handled the actual wheat speoifled in the certificates produced by him.   He may purohase quota wheat, retain the Quota certificate to meet his quota obligations and sell the wheat as &quot;de-certificated&quot; wheat.   Fortunately, a demand more or less equivalent to the quantity likely to be available in this respect, will come from poultry-keepers who should be able
to buy such &quot;de-certiflcated&quot; supplies of home-grown wheat as required at the normal parity with world prices.    Alternatively, a miller or flour importer may &quot;buy Quota certificates apart from wheat;    some millers, particularly country millers, will undoubtedly buy (for grinding) certificated wheat in excess of quota requirements and will dispose of excess Quota certificates, either directly or through, merchants, to those port millers or flour importers who require them.    In all cases, however, since a Quota certificate will be created only in connection with an initial sale of wheat of milling quality the wheat represented by the Quota certificates will have been actually bought and delivered to saneone befor*e it can rank for Quota purposes.When certificates change hands without wheat, the transaction will be in line with ordinary commercial practice in the commodity markets.    It must be considered, therefore, as an advantage and not a disadvantage that the certificate system, by admitting of the transfer and sale of documents, is of a character in keeping with the existing fluidity of the grain market.   The introduction of a new document, viz. the Quota certificate, will not alter the fundamental character of normal market transactions, (j) Arrangements would be necessary to detect fraud in connection with the issue of certificates.    In this matter the Board should be able to count upon the co-operation of its agents and of local advisory committees whose Interests would be involved in securing the detection of fraud and maintaining the reputation of the quota system generally9 5* Nature of Legislation required.In order to afford some idea of the kind of legislation required, the draft heads of a Eill to give effect to the Plan are contained in Appendix I attached heretoB Explanatory notes on the Plan are given in Appendix II. rkets Division,ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, 1st December, 1931.

B.ri .0/1/12/a.APJ^DLX___Ijj,tYHSAT QUOTA PLAN. 1951.Draft Heads of a Bill providing for the application to miller8 and flour importers of a home-grown wheat quota.Potter to Prescribe, Revoke or Vary a Quota of Home-grown wheat. The Minister may by order prescribe from time to time, for such periods as may be specified in the order, a minimum proportion (or quota) of home-grown wheat to be purchased by millers and importers of wheat flour, provided that the Minister shall: -(a) without prejudice to outstanding obligations in respect of any previous completed period, by Order revoke any such Order whenever the &quot;notified price&quot; (see III(lv) below) of home-grown wheat of milling quality exceeds x shillings per cwt;(b) fix the amount of the quota so as to ensure, so far as practicable, the purchase of all available supplies of home-grown wheat of milling quality in a regular or orderly manner;   and(e)   vary the amount of the quota fixed for any period if he considers that supplies of home-grown wheat of milling quality are not available in sufficient quantity to enable all flourmillers and importers to comply with their quota obligations. Ho   Establishment of aBlateriia Wheat Marketing Board.There shall be established an interim body to be called the Wheat Marketing Board, consisting of a Chairman and x other members who shall be appointed by the Minister and hold office as appointees of the Minister for such period as the Minister may determine.
The members of the Board shall be persons who have had wide experience and have shown capacity in industry, commerce or finance or in the conduct of public affairs.There shall be paid to the Chairman and other members of the Board such salaries and fees as the Minister may approve. The Board shall appoint and pay a secretary and such other officers and servants as the Board, with the Minister&apos;9 approval, t.a-determine. &apos;The Board shall register every producer of wheat who makes application for that purpose and every producer so registered shall stand in relation to the Board as if registration had been effected by the Board pursuant to a scheme approved under the Agricultural Marketing Act.     Applicants for registration shall be required by the Board to furnish particulars of their acreage under wheat, variety grown, estimated yield and such other information relating to the crop as the Board may require.*There shall be vested in the Board all or any of the powers for which a scheme may provide under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, and such other Sections of that Act as are relevant and also the provisions of the Second Schedule thereof shall, in effect, apply mutatis mu^ndis, as if the Board were constituted by a scheme approved under that Act. 11      Duties of the V/heat Marketing Board^, It shall be the general duty of the Board:-(a)    to secure that an adequate supply of home-grown wheat of milling quality is offered for sale by registered producers (or by the Board itself acting on behalf of .*   It is a question for consideration whether provision should not be made in the Quota Act to enable the hiinister or the Board to use the June 4th Returns for the purpose of checking this information, so far as possible, in individual cases.

in home-grown wheat for quota purposes;    and (vi) take all reasonable steps to ensure that flour millers and importers without discrimination shall be able to meet their   quota obligations.IV. Wheat Quota applied to Milling.In fulfilment of the requirements of any Order prescribing a quota, each flour miller in Great Britain, la respect of each flour mill he operates, and in respect of each period specified in the Order, shall produce and surrender to the proper authority, as and when required, Quota Certificates to the amount of the quota corresponding to the total amount of wheat usedaV. Wheat Quota applied to Imported Flour,.In fulfilment of the requirements of any Order prescribing a wheat quota, an importer of wheat flour into the United Kingdom shall, before the flour is delivered from Customs control, produce and surrender to the Customs and Excise, Quota Certificates for an amount equivalent to the wheat quota at that time in force calculated in relation to flour in accordance with a prescribed ratio.VI. j&amp;Kemption of Home-Milled Flour Exported by Millers.Any miller who exports flour, being the produce of his mill, and duly enters the same with the Customs before shipment, shall be granted relief from any Order prescribing a quota In respect of the quantity of wheat corresponding to the quantity of flour exported.VII. Books t Records and Returns.The books and records of flour millers shall be open to inspection by or on behalf of the Minister.The wheat Marketing Board, flour millers, flour
importers and owners of public warehouses in which grain and flour are stored shall furnish to the Minister   such information relating to stocks of wheat and flour as may be prescribed.VIII. Duration of Quota Act conditional on formation of producers&apos; Board under the Agricultural Marketing Act.Unless within a year from the date of the establishment of the interim 3oai&quot;d, or such further period not exceeding tv/o years as the Minister may allow, representatives of registered producers have submitted a scheme in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the Agricultural Marketing Aot for regulating the marketing of wheat, the provisions of the Quota Act shall cease to have effect and the Minister shall take steps to secure the winding-up of the interim Board.A scheme so submitted shall provide for the assumption by the new Board of the duties and obligations imposed on the interim Board by the ^quota Aot and may provide for the transfer to the new Board of the whole or any partof the property, rights and liabilities of the interim Board, for the continuation by or against the new Board of any legal proceedings, pending by or against the interim Board and for the dissolution, without winding-up, of the interim Board.IX.

APJrEKDIZ II. Confidential.B.-.y.g/l/12/b.HKPL&amp;NAT C RY    KOTias. 1. Administration and Procedure by the Minister.(a) Prescribing the /-mount of the Quota. Broadly, apart from minor variations which may have to be made from month to month in either case,  there are two main ways of fixing the quota -(j)    in an orderly trend to correspond with the normal course of seasonal marketings, (ii)    at a flat rate throughout the year. Millers and flour importers might prefer the latter, but, in the first year or bo, when the arrangements indicated in the Plan for regulating the flow of supplies by the Board may be somewhat rudimentary,   it may be anticipated that the Minister would, by agreement, fix the quota so that it alters, say from month to month, broadly in harmony with the anticipated rate of marketing by producers.    Thus the quota figure would be higher immediately after harvest than later in the season.(b) Varying the Quota. As a safeguard for millers and flour importers,  and in the event of miscalculation, the Minister may at any time vary the prescribed quota to correspond with the amount of available supplies.(c) Prescribing a standard, of Milling Quality. The definition, by the Minister,  of a standard of milling quality for home grown wheat and the specification,  in connection therewith,  of a scale of premiums and dockages for observance by the wheat Marketing Board and the trade, will encourage the production and marketing of the best types end qualities of home grown wheat and discourage negligent cultivation and preparation for market.(&amp;)      Inspection and Supervision.    tfith the certificate system, there would be no need to employ a large body of technically expert inspectors.    There are some 470 mills in this country, at least one third of which are small country mills probably engaged mostly in grinding stock feed.    The staff required to check the observance
of the quota &quot;by millers would not,  therefore, be numerous,and it is anticipated that arrangements could be made withthe Eoard of Customs and Ixcise, to use local IbceiseOfficers for the purpose of checking stocks and records.The Customs Officers already situated at the ports would deal with imported flour.    It is not, therefore,  anticipatedthat the coats of administration would be large;    it wouldbe possible to make them a charge upon the six eat Marketing Board.2.      Obligation on millers must be &quot;to purchase&quot; and not &quot;togrind&quot;.The proposals are characterised by a requirement thatflour millers shall purchase (and not necessarily grind)  a quota of home grown wheat.&apos;   The millers&apos; trade competitors, the flour importers,  are placed under a corresponding obligation.The requirement to purchase  (and not to grind) the quotaand the proposal to accept quota certificates as evidence of purchase is the only method of working the quota which:-.(i) is administratively practicable in this country; (11) does not disturb the present economic balance between port and country millers; (iii) secures fair-play between home-millers and flour-importecs and(iv) provides an effective check against the speculative &quot;cornering&quot;  of supplies.The alternative is a system which involves the physical admixture of home wheat by all   -millers in ever.? gristing,  and, consequentially,  a physical admixture of All-English flour by flour importers in every parcel of imported flour.Although this alternative has been favoured by some millers, it is open to the following serious,  indeed overwhelming objections:-(A)    it would be impossible to ensure that millers did,  in fact, grind the quota of home wheat in every gristing;    millers&apos; grist books could not be regarded as conclusive evidence of the
identity of the wheat used;   moreover there would be some pecuniary advantage to be gained by falei tying entries; a system of sworn declarations by millers and their   staffs does not seem to be practicable;    if a law cannot be enforced,  it should not be enacted;(ii)    physical admixture would involve the expense of transporting home wheat for milling to many parts of the United Kingdom where it is not ordinarily milled at present;    it would give rise to local shortages and to the creation of &quot;corners&quot;  in supplies and the quota plan would be in constant danger of a break-down.(iii)     flour importers would be put to considerable added expense in having to transport all-English flour to ports, and in having to erect mixing machinery and carry out mixing operations with every consignment of imported flour; the cost of compulsory mixing would be tantamount to a Customs Duty on imported flour;    importers would also have to depend on their trade competitors - British millers - for their All-English flour supplies.(iv)     compulsory admixture (even if enforceable) would interfere with the trade in recognised brands of home-milled and imported flour, and would be strongly objected to by certain classes of large-scale bakers in London, Glasgow and elsewhere on the ground of the difficulties that it -would create for them in making special types of bread;    it would alao be objected to by export-millers in Canada and Australia.The proposals in the Plan avoid all these objections and,  in fact, leave the trade free to manufacture and import the same kinds of flour as at present. 3.     flhy a wheat Marketing Organisation ie necessary.In the execution of the plan, provision must be made for the following, among other requirements, for which a national organisation of some kind is essential:-(a)    Supplies of British milling wheat or of QuotaCertificates (without supplies) must be available
2Sfreely as required by millers and flour importers.     Friction and deadlock through the actual or alleged holding up of supply must be prevented.(b; Supervision must be exercised over the issue ofquota certificates.    If the purchaser and/or grower were left unsupervised to issue certificates, there would be the likelihood of an amount of fraud sufficient to jeopardise the plan,  e.g.  in the multiplication of certificates on home wheat and the issue of certificates on imported wheat.(c)       The grower must be able to secure as nearly aspossible the maximum price laid down in the Quota Act.       As unorganised individuals, growers could not obtain anything like the price benefits which it is intended by the Plan they should have.    If a seasonal   quota only v/ere fixed, the comparatively small number of buyers of quota wheat could hold off from buying and break the price.   Moreover, temporary gluts,  due to the growers1 need for immediate realisation of stocks of wheat would be a constant source of instability.     Tfith a monthly quota,  the position of unorganised growers would be strengthened and prices would tend to be higher, but still the maximum price benefits could not possibly be reached so long as farmers freely competed with one another in the market against well-organised buyers.    To secure the best price benefits possible,  a monopoly of home-grown quota wheat operated in the interests of the growers is essential.
4&quot;     &quot;Vfhy a Producers&apos; Board,J-JLjg^jJLabie..    1* is possible to concoive of the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) above being met by organisations of other types than a monopoly operated in the interests of growers; but if such a monopoly were established, it would also have to operate in such a way as to meet the requirement in paragraph (c); and as, in the interests of economy and simplicity, it is desirable that there should be only one organisation, it follows that the body to be set up to carry out the organisational work under the Wheat :4ucta Plan should be preferably an Organisation acting in the interests of producers.The organisation must also have complete control over supplies and on that account should be fully representative and command the confidence of the producers.      It must be armed with powers necessary to give it such control.For the following, among other reasons, the most suitable type of organisation required seems, in fact, to be precisely that of a national board constituted by wheat producers under the Agricultural Marketing Act,  thus:(a) Such a board would &quot;be constituted by, be fully representative of, and responsible to,the producers.(b) It would have the necessary powers to regulate the sales of wheat in respect of quantities, manner, times and prices:  to prevent fraud in connection with the issue of certificates: and to arrange credit where necessary.(c) The Minister would have power to ensure that its&apos;scheme&apos; of operations was satisfactory, particularly as regards measures for fraud prevention. Accordingly, although, because time will be short, the Plan provides for the establishment of an interim &quot;Wheat Marketing Board by the Minister, it is proposed to use the
o agricultural Marketing Act as much as possible in regard to the powers and obligations of this interim Board and in regard to its relation to its constituents and the public, and to make the continuance of the Quota Act, beyond a period of at most two years, conditional on the substitution of the interim Board by a Board constituted by a scheme submitted under the Agricultural Marketing Act in the ordinary way.     An important point is that under this Plan it is proposed to leave to each individual producer a free choice as to whether he will submit himself to the Board&apos;s jurisdiction, but only producers who do so elect will benefit from the quota Plan, since, without the Board, producers could not secure the intended advantages. 5.     Functio ns^jpf^ the^ Interim Wheat Marketing Board.    T he essential functions of a Board have already been referred to, namely:-(a) to ensure that flour millers and importers are enabled, without discrimination, to meet their quota requirements; and to prove the existence of a supply to meet these requirements at any time.      This might involve the holding of a reserve either of wheat or of Certificates (from decertificated wheat) or both.(b) to issue, or supervise the issue of, quota certificates in connection with the initial sale by its agents of home grown wheat of milling quality; and to prevent fraud in connection with the certificates.(c) to secure the best possible prices for producers; this will probably involve the regulation of the rate and channels of marketing:Other functions would or could be -(d) to secure the observance of the statutory standard of milling quality with a scale of premiums and dockages:(e) the provision of market intelligence.16.
(f) the strengthening of the credit-status of producers;(g) the provision of drying and storage facilities in so far as these may be necessary;(h) the promotion of the production of better varieties and of other improvements in the technique of wheat growing.To these must be added the general task of co-operating with the authority responsible for the quota. 6.    Checks against &quot;cornering11 Wheat or Certificates.     Under a system requiring physical admixture of the home quota by millers and flour importers, it would be possible to &quot;corner&quot; home wheat supplies or at any rate to create acute local shortages of home wheat, but under the certificate system, a &quot;corner&quot; in home wheat unaccompanied by certificates would be ineffective and meaningless and local wheat shortages would cease to present a problem.     Moreover, if the current price of quota wheat exceeds a statutory maximum, the Plan provides that the Minister shall revoke the quota Order.Any serious attempt to &quot;corner&quot; Quota Certificates would be rendered practically imposeible by:-(i)    the provision limiting the validity of the certificates to a specified period after the date of issue;(ii) the provision requiring the Wheat Marketing Board to supply all buyers with home wheat to meet quota requirements and(iii)    the power of the Minister to vary the quota if sufficient supplies are not available. 7.    Reason for maximum price in 5,quota Act.    Since the quota will be so fixed as to absorb all the available supplies of homo wheat of milling quality the Wheat Marketing Board, in complete control of supplies at the source, will operate under monopolistic conditions and a statutory limit must accordingly be set to the price which it may demand.     This
is the reason for the imposition of a maximum price - to be defined in relation to point of delivery - which, in practice, will become virtualljr a guaranteed price, since it may be anticipated that the Wheat Marketing Board, in the exercise of its powers, will seek to stabilise the price of quota wheat as near as possible to the prescribed maximum.     This is the intention of the Plan, namely that growers should be able to get this price through organisation.8.   Value of Quota Certificates.      It follows from the foregoing paragraph that any transfer of quota certificates without wheat will normally be effected at a figure approximating to the difference between the prescribed maximum price for home wheat and the price of &quot;decertificated&quot; wheat which would in fact correspond with the current United Kingdom price of comparable imported wheat.
