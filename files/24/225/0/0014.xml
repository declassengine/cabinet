Ibis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 3BCBET . C A B I IE I,COPY&quot;    HO ao..o...e.C .P.314(31)SUNDAY PBREOBMAHCES BILL . Memorandum by Mr. Oliver Stanley.History.The main provisions regulating Sunday performances are to &quot;be found in the Sunday Observance Act,  1780, which under penalty of  200 a day payable to a common informer prohibits entertainments on Sunday if the public is admitted thereto on payment.      This Act, precise in its terms, has never been repealed, but the practice in certain areas recently has been to treat its provisions as obsolete,  in the case at least of certain classes of entertainment.      The two most important instances were those of concerts, which,  following a High Court decision at the end of the last century, have become general in London a.nd other parts of the country, and cinemas .      In the ca.se of cinemas the London County Council,  the licensing authority for London, while not actually purporting to license Sunday performances, had agreed with the cinemas not to take steps for the enforcement against them of the provisions of the Sunday Observance Act,  1780,  on certain conditions, which include the prohibition of a seven-day week for employees and the payment to charity of a sum representing the profits from the performances.      This practice had grown rapidly since it was introduced in 1916, until today the great majority of London cinemas are giving Sunday evening performances,  and the example of London has been followed by 96 other authorities.     A recent decision of the High Court, upheld by the Court of Appeal,  ma.de it clear that authorities have no power to make such agreements with regard to cinemas, while in the  course of the judgmentcons i de rable/
Us,considerable doubt was thrown on the authority of the case which had up till then been held to permit the giving of Sunday concerts.Hence it is clear that the Act of 1730 while unrepealed still prohibits these and other such forms of Sunday entertainment, despite all ingenious attempts to circumvent it,  and a number of actions brought by public spirited informers emphasised the fact that failing any legislative action,  entertainments which have been tolerated in practice for many years must now cease. Before such drastic action was taken it was felt that after a lapse of 150 years Parliament should once again have an opportunity of expressing its opinion,  and under those circumstances the late Government introduced the Sunday Cinemas Bill during the course of this summer,  not with the intention of pressing any particular policy, but to give Parliament that opportunity.      It will be remembered that the Bill,  though treated as a Government Bill and afforded the consequential facilities, was left to the free vote of the House.Scope of Mr.  Clynes&apos; Bill.Ho attempt was made at any general revision of the Act of 1730, and only those classes of public entertainment were included where it vras felt that the practice of Sunday performances was so general and well-established that widespread public feeling would be involved in its abolition.      These classes were -(1)    Cinemas(2)    Concerts(3)    Museums,  Zoos,  etc.(4)    Public Debates. In dealing with them the principle of local option was adopted and the onus of Sunday licensing was placed upon County Councils and County Borough Councils .     Before any action could be taken with regard to all or any of the four classes,  the Council was required/
required to pass a specific resolution in favour of Sunday opening of the particular class or classes in the area after being satisfied that such opening was &quot;in accordance with a substantial demand in the locality&quot;.      Once the general resolution was passed the Council was to be empowered to issue individual licences subject to such conditions as was thought fit, and in the case of cinemas subject to  obligatory conditions with regard to employment and the payment of profits to charities,  thus continuing the practice already existing in London.      The Bill made one general amendment of the Act of 1780 by abolishing the common informer procedure and placing the obligation for the enforcement of that Act on the local authorities.      Incidentally the Bill provided for the discharge of various actions already commenced by common informers.Parliamentary History.On Second Reading considerable opposition was shown to the Bill on religious grounds by spokesmen of such bodies as the Lords Day Observance Society,  etc., while the exclusion of theatres,  the question of Sunday employment, and the principle of local option were also  criticised.      Nevertheless the Bill, in face of an almost unprecedented post card propaganda,  received a Second Reading by 258 to 210.     As a matter of interest,  in view of the present composition Of the House,  it may be mentioned that actually a slight majority of Conservatives voted against the Bill.     During the Committee Stage a great deal of obstruction was met with, but fair progress was made.      An amendment to include theatres was drastically defeated,  so also was a proposal to make the justices the licensing authority,   on the ground that this was a question which ought to be determined by democratically elected, bodies.     An amendment was, however,  accepted which, while leaving the County Council as licensing authority,  required an affirmative resolution from an Urban District Council before licences could be granted in its area.Thi s/
This was the stage reached when the Mational Government was formed and,  on the re-assembly of the House in September, the Prime Minister announced that the Bill being of a controversial nature would not be proceeded with.      In order, however,  that the position should remain unaltered, pending an opportunity for Parliament to arrive at a decision, an Act of a purely temporary character was passed to regularise for one year the existing practice with regard to cinemas and concerts.      This Bill became law on October 7th,  and,  failing any further action by-Parliament, on October 7th next year the armistice will come to an end and Sunday entertainments will once more be illegal.On review of this difficult problem,  there seem to be only four possible  courses of action :-(l)    To extend the existing Act for a short period, if it is felt   there will bei no Parliamentary opportunity for discussion this year.There appear to be two substantial objections to this course.      In the first place the Act is  of an obviously temporary character with no logical basis,  for while it allows licensing authorities which in 1930 purported to exercise powers in respect of cinemas and concerts  (which in fact they never possessed) to continue exercising those powers,  it denies such right to all other authorities, who may have been actuated in their previous refusal of Sunday licences, not by any lack of demand in their areas, but by a more accurate appreciation of the law.      Obvious anomalies are created which may be tolerated in a purely temporary Act, but would raise great opposition if continued.      Further,  an extension would in itself require legislation,  as not only does the gap between October and December make the inclusion of the existing measures in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act a, matter of practical difficulty, but a definite assurance was given that such was not the intention of the Government.
(2)    To allov/ the present Act to expire without introducing; any further legislation.If this course is adopted a difficult situation will arise.     Not only will the provisions of the Sunday Observance Act,  1780, again become operative, but the considered decision of the Government not to amend, them following on the recent controversy will give to them a modern sanction which hitherto they have lacked.      It would be impossible for local authorities to acquiesce any longer in what will then be recognised as a breach of the law,  and a general and immediate cessation of all forms of Sunday entertainment where payment is taken must be expected.     Not only cinemas,  but concerts, museums,  zoological gardens,  debates,  as well as the more questionable cases of greyhound racing,  boxing,  etc., will be affected.      A large section of the community will suddenly be deprived of recreations which they have enjoyed unquestioned and unquestionably for many years.      A deep sense of grievance might result,  the consequences of which,  in London particularly, need not be ela/borated.(3)    To deal comprehensively with the problem of Sunday-entertainment .This would necessitate the substitution Of a modern Act for the Acts of 1625 and 1780,  and the consequent repeal of those Acts.      In view of the reverence in which they,   or ra,ther the tradition for which they stand, are held by many sections of the  community,   it is a task which any Government would be relucta.nt to undertake except from urgent necessity,  while, with the exception of the question of Sunday games to which reference is made later,  the  classes of entertainment dealt with in Mr.  Clynes&apos;  Bill are the only ones, where any considerable section of public opinion comes actively into conflict with the provisions of the Sunda.y Observance Act,  1780.     Such Sunday entertainments as boxing, gre.yhound racing and. dirt-tra,ck ra,influencing are probably illega.1 under the provisions of that Act,  but thereis certainly a. great volume of public opinion opposed tolegalising/
i. ty c/legalising them, while there is no pronounced movement in their favour.      If so it would seem unwise to raise the whole question of the Sunday Observance Acts with no further object than a re-statement of the existing law.(4)    To introduce a Bill on the lines of Mr.  Clynes&apos;  Bill of 1931.The advantage of this course is that it presents the best chance of a speedy passage into law, while dealing effectively if not with the whole question, at least with that part which arouses active interest.      The last Parliament gave its assent to the Bill by a substantial majority,  and there is little reason to doubt that a similar result would follow in this - at any rate if such a Bill were introduced during the early life of Parliament while a general election still seems far distant.      It is assumed that the precedent of the last Government would be followed,  that it would be made clear that the Bill does not represent the considered view of the Government as a whole, but is introduced as the  most convenient method of facilitating Parliamentary discussion and decision and that a free vote would be allowed, although in the event of the Bill obtaining a Second Reading the Government would provide facilities for its further stages.      The amendments which were agreed to in Committee Stage of the last Bill referred to above would be incorporated in the new one, while with regard to the inclusion of stage-plays,  it will be noted that the Committee decided strongly against it.In framing the Bill the question of Sunday games should not be overlooked.      The difficulty here lies not in the Act of 1780 but in the Act of 1625, which provides inter alia that there shall be no meetings,  assemblies  or concourse of peopleout of their own parish on the Lord&apos;s &amp;&amp;y......for any sportsor pastimes whatsoever.      This provision, which is based not on the righteousness of the game to be played but the locality ofits/
its play, is manifestly absurd, &quot;but unfortunately it is also lav/. Considerable doubt is felt by local autiiorities,   including the London County Council, as to the legality of their action in allowing Sunday games in their parks,  and one Borough Council at least (Sunderland) has taken the view that it has no such power. A repeal of this section would not have the effect of legalising professional games organised for the benefit of supporters, which could still be dealt with - and indeed more effective^ -under the Act of 1780.      This section of the Act of 1625 is the only section of the Act applicable in any way to modern life,  and the decision to repeal this section,  if taken,   could safely be extended to the repeal of the Act as a. whole.      If, however,   it is felt that it would be unwise for the Government to take the responsibility of introducing the question, it would be possible so to draft the Bill,  that an amendment of this clmracter moved by a private Member would be in order and could be discussed and decided upon by Parliament.If the Government decides on  (4), I hope that priority will be given to such a Bill.      Considerable obstruction in Committee was experienced during the last Parliament and. some of the chief exponents survived into this.     Unless therefore ample time in Committee is assured,  there might be some risk of failure to pass the Committee Stage before the clos&amp; of the Session.CP.3.
