THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government confidential. Copy No.    9CP. 331 (31).CABINET.MEMORANDUM. Proposed Amendments of the Covenant of the League of Nations.(Circulated by Direction or the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)Prefatory Minute.AS will be seen from paragraph 27 (e) of the annexed memorandum, a decision is needed before the Disarmament Conference meets on the 2nd February as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the amendments proposed to bring the League Covenant into conformity with the Kellogg^Pact (see also end of paragraph 11). I suggest that the Cabinet should approve amendments in the form in which they were drafted by the sub-committee of the Eleventh Assembly in-Jb930; the Imperial Conference of October 1930 has already recommended this course, and the Secretary-General was informed in February 1931 of the previous Governments approval (paragraph 11 (c)). Several of the Dominions have expressed assent (paragraphs 27&apos;(a) and (b)). But the amend-ments should not be ratified prior to the entry into force of a General Disarmament Convention (see paragraph 11 (c2). Our delegation should be given a discretion to deal as seems best, but subject to the general attitude authorised above, with any further suggestions such as those referred to in paragraph 26.J. S.December 25, 1931.Memorandum.1. THE attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom towards the proposed amendments of the Covenant of the League of Nations, in order to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris, will shortly have &quot;to be considered, and it has accordingly been &quot;thought desirable to submit a memorandum setting forth as shortly as possible the history of this question.2. In the course of the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations in September 1929 a resolution was submitted in the name of the United Kingdom6133   [6359] &apos; b
delegation, and supported by the delegations of Belgium, Chile, France and Italy, suggesting that the Covenant of the League of Nations should be brought into conformity with the text of the Pact of Paris. Mr. Arthur Henderson introduced a resolution in his Assembly speech, explaining that its object was &quot; to cut out from the Covenant the dead wood which now remains.&quot; The resolution was referred to the First Committee, where Sir C. Hurst elaborated the details of the proposal.3. Sir Cecil said that when the Covenant was being drafted the authors had felt that unless certain loop-holes were left it would not secure general acceptance. Since the Covenant had come into force such progress had been made in the organisation of peace as to enable the world to accept the more far-reaching stipulations embodied in the Pact of Paris. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom therefore considered that some of the provisions of the Covenant now required re-examination.4. Four changes in the text of the Covenant were required, i.e., a principal change in article 12 and article 15, paragraph 7, respectively, with consequential changes in article 13 and article 15, paragraph 6.5. Article 12 stipulates that if there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, then &quot;they will submit the matter either to arbitration, or to judicial settlement, or to enquiry by the Council.&quot; The article goes on to say that &quot; they agree, in no case, to resort to war until threuniont,hs-,ai!ter the award by the arbitrators or the jiidicial decision oFtTTe report by the Council.&quot; In order to make this application at least as far-reaching as that embodied in the Pact of Paris, all that was necessary in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to stop short at the words &quot; they will in no case resort to war,&quot; and delete the phrase which permits recourse to war after three months.6. Similarly, in article 13 it would be necessary to delete the words &quot;and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith,&quot; these words no longer corresponding with the conditions created by the Pact of Paris.7. An amendment of a similar character was required in article 15, paragraph 6, where, in place of the obligation not to go to war with any party complying with the recommendations of the report of the Council, he would propose to substitute the following  &quot; The Members of the League agree that as against any party to the dispute that complies with the recommendations of the report they will take no action which is inconsistent with its terms.&quot;8. A more important amendment was required in article 15, paragraph 7. Under this paragraph provision is made that if the Council is unable to arrive at a unanimous decision the Members of the League &quot; reserve to themselve&apos;s-the right to-take sucli action as they shall consijiejimecessary for the maintenance of right and justice?&apos; This lsHthlTlBo^alledgap in the Covenant which leaves Members of the League the right to resort to war in certain events. Such a recourse to war now being covered by the terms of article 1 of the Pact of Paris, His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to close the gap by adding the words &quot;other than a resort to war &quot; immediately after the words quoted above.9. Sir Cecil Hurst remarked that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not propose to amend article 16. It was true that the sanctions under that article applied to violations of articles 12, 13 and 15, and that, if the scope of these articles were broadened by the acceptance of the present proposals, there would therefore result, in theory, a certain increase in the obligations of Members of the League. His Majesty&apos;s Government had come to the conclusion that this slight extension of the obligations imposed by article 16 was the wisest course to take. It was a theoretical rather than a practical extension, and it would, on the other hand, cause great complications if article 16 had to be amended so as to apply only to violations of the Covenant as it now stood, and not to violations of the unconditional obligation to refrain from war which it was now proposed to insert in it.
10. No detailed discussion of these proposals took place in 1929, but the Assembly passed a resolution to the effect that it was desirable that the terms of the Covenant of the League of Nations should not accord any longer to Members of the League the right to have recourse to war in cases in which that right has been renounced by the provisions of the Pact of Paris. The Assembly therefore instructed the Secretary-General to communicate to Members of the League a Copy of the amendments proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and invited the Council to appoint a committee of eleven persons to draw up and submit to the Eleventh Assembly a report of the proposed amendments.11.   The discussions thus initiated have passed through several stages :  (a) The committee set up in pursuance of the above resolution met inFebruary and March 1930, and drafted amendments to the preamble and to articles 12, 13, 15 and 16 of the Covenant.(b) These amendments were discussed by the First Committee of the EleventhAssembly in September 1930, which appointed an ad hoc sub-committee to examine them. The sub-committee made substantial changes in some of the proposed amendments, and drafted a text which at one moment seemed likely to secure assent. Last minute difficulties, however, led to a belief that the matter was still not sufficiently ripe, and the sub-committee decided by a majority, against the vote of the United Kingdom delegate, to recommend a postponement till the Assembly of 1931.   The recommendation was adopted.(c) The Imperial Conference of October 1930 placed on record the view thatthe amendments in the form in &quot;which they were drafted by the sub-committee of the Eleventh Assembly should be recommended to the several Governments for acceptance. But they endorsed the view which had already been expressed by. the United Kingdom delegation at the Assembly that the amendments should not be ratified prior to the entry into force of a general disarmament cx/ii volition.&quot;&quot; 11 is Maj esty&apos;s Government indheLTnhea^^ behalf,informed the Secretary-General of the League in February 1931 that they were prepared to support the amendments in the form proposed by the sub-committee of the Eleventh Assembly, subject to the condition mentioned above as regards ratification. His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa communicated with the League of Nations in a similar sense. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State also indicated their preparedness to accept the amendments formulated by the sub-committee, but suggested some further verbal amendments in articles 12 and 15.(d) The Twelfth Assembly reconsidered the amendments in September 1931.The instructions of the United Kingdom delegation on this occasion were to ask for a postponement on the ground that the new Govern-ment of the United Kingdom had not yet had time to determine their policy in this matter.After a general discussion in the First Committee, the matter was referred to a sub-committee, which interpreted its task as being first of all to present a clear statement of the opinions held by the delegations on the different texts, to consider the further amendments proposed by Governments since the last Assembly, and to bring about, so far as possible, a reconciliation of such differences of opinion as were found to exist. The sub-committee submitted to the committee a report drafted by M. Rolin, the Belgian representative, reviewing the whole position. This report did not endorse any of the further amendments which had been proposed since the Assembly of 1930, though it recommended that one or two of them should be retained for further consideration. The report was approved by the First Committee, but was not formally adopted by the Assembly, which, however, passed a resolution, taking note of the report, reaffiming^s,iriimlaan-Ql.cimtinmngJJie taskjof_j.pserti.ngJnjhe Covenant a general prohibition of^gcourse to&apos; war andjthe prhicjpleLthat^e^segl^ent^of inteimat^mju^jdlsputei^might onlyjiL^ and decidingthat a special committe&quot;e&quot;6T representatives of all Members of the League should[6359] b 2
be convened to meet while the Disarmament Conference was in progress, for the purpose of drawing up a final text which might be voted by the Assembly at its next session. The Secretary-General was to give Members of the League the opportunity of sending to the Council their views as to the lines on which they thought agreement could be attained.12. In order to facilitate consideration of the draft amendments, it is proposed in the following paragraphs to set them out separately, indicating the stages through which each has passed :  Preamble.13. The phrase in the preamble which it is proposed to modify runs at present as follows :  &quot; In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve inter-national peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war.&quot;The amendment suggested is to substitute for the last words the following :   &quot;by accepting the obligation not to resort to war.&quot;This amendment, proposed by the Committee of Eleven and endorsed by the sub-committee of the 1930 Assembly, is one of form rather than of substance, and gives rise to no difficulty.Article 12.14.   Article 12, paragraph 1, in its present form, reads as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council.&quot;It will be recollected that the original British proposal was merely to delete the last clause (from &quot;and they agree&quot; onwards). The Committee of Eleven con-sidered that the article, thus truncated, required some amplification and that the specific obligation not to resort to war for the settlement of disputes should be introduced.   They therefore proposed to draft the paragraph as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will only employ pacific means for its settlement.&quot;If the disagreement continues, the dispute shall be submitted either to arbitration or judicial settlement, or to enquiry by the Council. The Members of the League agree that they will in no case resort to war for the solution of their dispute.&quot;The sub-committee of the 1930 Assembly proposed a further redraft which, while not changing the substance, appears to represent an improvement of form : I &quot;The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between\\   them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will in no case have j\   recourse to war for the settlement of the dispute, and will only employ \ \ pacific means for this purpose.   If the dispute cannot be otherwise settled, l \ it shall be submitted either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry 1 ) by the Council.&quot;The proposed amendment does not, in either of its forms, involve any new obligation of substance.15.   Article 12, paragraph 2, runs at present as follows : 1&apos; In any case under this article the award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall be made within a reasonable time and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.&quot; &quot; &apos;
The sub-committee of the 1930 Assembly recommended the following simpli-fication, which seems free from objection : &quot; The award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall be given and the report of the Council shall be made within a reasonable period.&quot;Article 13.16. The first proposed amendment of primary importance is to article 13,. paragraph 4.   The paragraph at present runs as follows : &quot; The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.&quot;The Committee of Eleven agreed without difficulty to substitute for the obligation &quot; not to resort to war against &quot; a loyal League Member the obligation &quot;to take no action against.&quot; But a long debate occurred on the second sentence regarding the right of the Council to propose steps to deal with a case of failure to carry out an,award. The French delegate desired to amend the article so as to give the Council the right to &quot;propose steps&quot; by a majority. Lord Cecil strongly opposed this suggestion, and after a long debate it was decided to recommend that the Council should act in such cases by unanimity not counting the parties. The paragraph as it emerged from the Committee of Eleven ran therefore as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and that they will not take any action against any Member of the League which complies therewith.&quot;In the event of any failure to carry out such award or decision, the Council shall propose what measures of all kinds should be taken to give effect thereto. The votes of the representatives of the parties shall not be counted.&quot;17. The sub-committee did not make any change in the proposed amendment, but devoted considerable attention to another point which arose on this article. Some doubt was expressed whether the obligation of Members of the League &quot;to carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered&apos;&apos; related only to parties to the dispute, or whether the terms of the award could impose any binding obligation on Members of the League who were not parties to the dispute. The opinion of the sub-committee was that the former interpretation was the more logical and had probably been intended; and that it would be a good thing to amend the paragraph in such a way as to make this clear.   The text finally recommended by the sub-committee was as follows : &apos;&apos; The Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith the award or decision rendered in a dispute to which they have been parties.&apos;&apos; They further undertake in no way to support a State in refusal to carry out an award or decision. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what measures of all kinds should be taken to give effect thereto; the votes of the representatives of the. parties shall not be counted&apos;.&apos;&apos;18. It will thus be seen that the final result of the proposed amendment to article 13, paragraph 4, is somewhat to strengthen the powers of the Council, as against a party to a dispute failing to carry out an award, by permitting the Council in such an event &apos;&apos; to propose measures of all kinds by a unanimous vote, not counting the votes of the parties. On the other hand, it has been made clear that no obligation can be imposed by an award (other than the obligation to take no action against a State which complies with it) except on the parties, concerned in the dispute.[6359] b 3
Article 15.19.   Article 15, paragraph 6, runs in its present form as follows : &quot; If the report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report.&quot;It was felt by the committee that the mere removal of the obligation not to go to war with a party complying with a report of the Council, or the substitution for it of a mere obligation to take no action against such a party, would leave the paragraph extremely weak. There was a strong movement in the committee, headed by the Polish and French delegates, to make the report of the Council, when arrived at unanimously by Members of the Council other than the parties, binding on the parties themselves. After a long debate this view prevailed, and the text was drafted as follows : &quot; If the report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will comply with the recommendations of the report. If the Council&apos;s recommendation is not carried out the Council shall propose suitable measures to give it effect.&quot;20. This amendment, however, came in for some criticism at the 1930 Assembly, and the sub-committee reconsidered the matter at length. They came to the conclusion that the time was not ripe for imposing on the parties to a dispute a binding obligation to accept the unanimous report of the other members of the Council, and they re-amended the paragraph in such a way as to leave it open to a party to refuse to accept the report, adding, however, an obligation on all Members of the League in no way to support any party in such a refusal. The text proposed by the sub-committee runs as follows : &quot;If the report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Council shall invite the parties to comply with the recommendations of the report. The Members of the League undertake in no way to support any party in refusal to comply with such recommendations.&quot;This text, while asserting in clearer form the moral weight of a report agreed by all members of the Council other than the parties, does not seem in any way to alter the existing legal position. The French Government would undoubtedly prefer to return to the legally binding text proposed by the Committee of Eleven.21. An amendment to article 15, paragraph 7, is of less importance. This paragraph now runs as follows : &quot;If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.&quot;The amendment proposed by the United Kingdom delegation in 1929 was merely to insert the words &quot;other than a resort to war&quot; after &quot;take such action.&quot; The Committee of Eleven and the Sub-Committee both preferred a slightly different form of words, which seems free from objection : &quot; If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, it shall examine the procedure best suited to meet the case and recommend it to the parties.&quot;22. The Committee of Eleven also discussed, in connexion with article 15, the question of the power of the Council to ask the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion on points of law relating to the dispute.   It has always been a moot point whether a decision to ask for an
advisory opinion is a question of substance, for which a unanimous decision is required, or a question of procedure which the Council is competent to decide^ under article 4 of the Covenant, by a majority vote. The Council has always, in fact, for safety&apos;s sake, proceeded on the former assumption, and the question has never been formally raised. The Committee of Eleven took the view that, whatever the position under the existing Covenant, it was desirable to accord to the Council the right to request an advisory opinion by a majority decision. They therefore drafted the following clause :  &quot;At any stage of the examination, the Council may, either at the request of one of the parties or on its own initiative, ask the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion on points of law relating to the dispute. Such application shall not require a unanimous vote by the Council.&quot;During the summer of 1930, however, it was privately represented that th^ adoption of this amendment would place difficulties in the way of American adherence to the Statute of the Permanent Court, which was then believed tc be imminent, and the proposed amendment was therefore dropped by the sub-committee. Now that prospects of American participation have become once more remote, it is possible that this amendment may be revived.Article 16.23. Article 16 of the Covenant deals with the sanctions to be applied to any Member of the League which &apos;&apos; resorts to war in disregard of its covenants under articles 12 13 or 15.&quot; The proposed amendments referred to above concentrate the prohibition to resort to war into article 12, and make it absolute. There is therefore a proposed consequential amendment to article 16, which, instead of citing &quot;articles 12, 13 or 15,&quot; will (if the amendments are adopted) cite only article 12. The bearing of the article thus remains unchanged, since all resort to war for the settlement of a dispute would, under the amended Covenant, constitute a breach of artuclej.2&quot;24. No other amendment is proposed to article 16, but it is on this article that most of the controversy about the proposed amendments has turned. In introducing the proposal of the United Kingdom delegate in 1929, Sir Cecil Hurst admitted that the extension of the existing prohibition of war in certain cases to a prohibition of war in all cases implied a theoretical increase of possible violations of the Covenant and, consequently, of applications of the sanctions under article 16. This point was strongly pressed by those who were doubtful of the value of the proposed amendments, particularly by the delegates of the Scandinavian Powers. Those who supported the amendments, including, notably, the United Kingdom delegate, argued that the alleged extension of the sanctions was theoretical rather than practical, and that the proposed amend-ments, by strengthening the moral safeguards against war, would in fact reduce the likelihood of sanctions being required. But while there was a prolonged debate on this question in the First Committee of the Eleventh Assembly, one point seemed to be generally recognised, i.e., that it was virtually impossible to create two kinds of obligation under the^Cqvenant not to resort to war, one the obligation under The existing Covenantwhich was subject to; sanctions, and the other anew obligation^mtroduced into the Uovenant from &apos;th&apos;e&quot;Kellogg Pact and not subject to sanctions. It seems, indeed, probable that those who opposed the amendments on the ground of the so-called extension of the sanctions would have given way, and the amendments been approved by the Eleventh Assembly, but for a new difficulty of a different character which was raised at the last moment by the Norwegian delegation and which created hesitation in other quarters, particularly among representatives of the Little Entente.25. The question thus raised was whether the proposed amendments might not affect the validity of treaties, under which the parties had bound themselves to take military action in certain eventualities, it being understood that the treaty principally referred to was the Treaty of Locarno. This argument did not alarm the signatories of the Locarno Treaty, who had satisfied themselves that their obligations under that treaty were in no way in contradiction with the
sKellogg Pact or with the proposed amendments to the Covenant. But it created doubts and hesitations among the Powers of the Little Entente who had bound themselves to common military action in certain cases, e.g., in the event of a Habsburg being restored to the Throne of Hungary. The foundation of these doubts were slender. For, if such engagements in fact exist and would be contrary to the terms of the proposed amendments, it is more than doubtful whether they can Be regarded as compatible either with the Pact of Paris or with the existing Covenant (which would only permit of war after an interval of nine months). These questions have not been openly raised, and it is improbable that they will be; but they should be borne in mind as an element in the opposition encountered by the proposed amendments.26. In addition to the amendments considered above, there are a certain number of amendments proposed by Governments since the 1930 Assembly, which may be revived when the committee meets during the Disarmament Conference. Of these the more important are as follows : (a) A proposal by the Italian Government to insert the following provisoafter the first paragraph of article 16 :- &quot;. . . . Provided always that in the case dealt with in article 16. paragraph 7, the Members of the League may make their action subject to the condition that the Council is unanimous either in proposing provisional measures intended to re-establish peace or in declaring which is the Covenant-breaking State.&quot;(b) A proposal by the Government of Finland that the first paragraph ofarticle 12 should run as follows :  &quot;The Members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council. They agree in no case to resort to war for the settlement of their disputes and to employ only pacific means to attain such settlement.&apos;&apos;(c) A proposal by the Government of Finland that paragraphs 6 and 7 ofarticle 15 should run as follows : &quot;6. If the report of the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the party which complies with the recommenda-tions of the report may make this a ground for claiming a settlement of the dispute in accordance with the Council&apos;s recommendations. The Members of the League undertake in no way to support any party in a refusal to comply with such recommendations.&quot;7. If the Council fails to reach unanimity as defined in the previous paragraph, and the parties do not accept the recommenda-tions made by the majority, the Council shall make recommendations as to the best procedure to be followed subsequently by the parties for the settlement of their dispute.&quot;27. It now remains therefore to determine the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the proposed amendments. The formal position is that : (a) The Imperial Conference of October 1930 placed on record their view that the amendments in the form in which they were drafted by the sub-committee of the Eleventh Assembly should be recommended to the several Governments for acceptance.(&amp;) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom informed the Secre-tary-General in February 1931 that they approved the amendments in this form, and notifications in a similar sense were made by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State. (The Canadian delegate at the last Assembly of the League made a similar statement on behalf of Canada.)
(c) The   United   Kingdom   delegation    informed    the    Assembly    inSeptember 1981 that the new Government was not yet in a position to define its attitude.(d) A committee composed of all the Members of the League will meet toexamine the proposed amendments during the Disarmament Conference.(e) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are invited to com-municate their views to the Secretary-General prior to the opening of the Disarmament Conference.28.

Papers regarding the proposed Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations in order to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928.September 1929-A7ou ember 1980.No. 1.Extract from Prime Minister&apos;8 Speech of September 3, 1929.During the course of his speech at the Tenth Session of the Assembly of the League of Nations on the 3rd September, 1929, the Prime Minister used the following words : &quot;We want, however, to make further contributions at this Assembly, and since our Government came into office it has been considering what it could do to advance, to build up, what I call the foundations for the Pact of Peace.&quot; I would like you to consider the effect of the Pact of Peace upon the assumptions of certain clauses of the Covenant of the League of Nations, because it is all to the good if we can prune out dead wood from the Covenant. There were certain clauses, certain assumptions, certain ideas in the back of our minds when the Covenant was drafted, which already represented a dead age. In order to make the pact effective, I would draw your attention especially to articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant, and ask you to consider whether we cannot bring that very old document into relation with certain things that have happened since. This matter, however, will come before you in another way.&quot;No. 2.Extract from Speech delivered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Seventh Meeting of the Tenth Session of the Assembly of the League of Nations, held on September 6, 1929.I am now going to venture to introduce in greater detail a subject to which the British Prime Minister made a brief reference in his speech. Other speakers, including M. - Briand and M. Hymans, raised the question of the relation of the Covenant of the League of Nations to the Pact of Peace signed in August of last year.*   The entry into force of the Pact of Peace is a great* Cmd. 3410.5653 Wt. - 3000 12/30 F.O.P. 22169b 2
new event which has happened since the last session of the Assembly. It is a great new addition to international law by which the relations of States are governed and controlled. It is of importance to every country, and especially to those countries which are members of the League of Nations.The purpose of the pact was the outlawry of war. It was the solemn renunciation of the right or power of the signatory States to have recourse to force as an instrument of their national policy. That is article 1 of the Pact of Peace. It was the solemn under-taking that in no case would they seek to settle their disputes by other than pacific means. That is article 2. These new under-takings have already been accepted by the vast majority of the members of the League. Even those which have not yet definitely assumed these obligations have made plain their firm intention to do so at an early date.. What is the result of the engagements so entered into? It is this: that the members of the League are bound, in their mutual relations with regard to international disputes and recourse to war, by two different systems or sets of obligations : those of the Covenant of the League of Nations and those of the new Pact of Peace.. The Covenant need I remind this Assembly? was drawn up on the morrow of war. It was prepared by a commission of the Peace Conference of 1919. It was without question a remarkable piece of work, and each year as it goes by proves more clearly the wisdom of those who drew it up. Its authors, however, were bound by the will of the Governments of that day, and those Governments were not prepared to renounce completely the right of what we now call private war. They were prepared to go some distance in that direction, and, indeed, the Covenant goes very far, but it does not go all the way.The Covenant contains what the lawyers have called gaps  the gaps of article 15; it contains the provisions of article 12, to which I shall draw your attention in a moment. These gaps make possible the recourse to war as an instrument of national policy in certain cases where the League, under the terms of the Covenant, has not been able to reach a decision in a dispute, or where, a decision having been reached, it has not been accepted by the parties to that dispute.The right of private war thus remains legitimate in several sets of circumstances under the Covenant as it now stands, but this right of private war, which its authors were compelled by their Govern-rhents in 1919 to leave in the Covenant, has been abolished by the Pact: of Peace. This means, therefore, not that there is a contradiction or conflict between the Covenant on the one hand and the pact on the other, but that the pact has gone beyond the Covenant and has filled the gaps which the Covenant left open. -Let me cite briefly some concrete examples of what I mean. Paragraph 1 of article 12 of the Covenant reads as follows : &quot; The &apos; members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter
either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report of the Council.&quot;Observe, if you please, that after an award or a decision or a report has been made, and after three months have gone by, a party to a dispute under the Covenant is free to resort to war unless the other party has accepted the award. &quot;Under the Covenant they still have this freedom, but under the pact they have no such freedom; they have relinquished it.Similarly, paragraph 6 of article 15 lays down that, if the report by the Council is agreed to by all the members of the Council, if one party accepts that report while the other does not, the accepting party may resort to war against the party which does not accept. Thus, under the Covenant, members of the League retain the right to resort to war to secure justice for themselves. Under the Pact of Paris, the Pact of Peace, that same right has been renounced.Likewise, paragraph 7 of article 15 lays it down that,- if the Council fails to reach a report to which it unanimously agrees, the members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice. Under the Covenant they have this right to go to war. Under the Pact of Paris, the Pact of Peace, they have given up that right.Now, the Covenant is the Constitution of the League of Nations. It is the fundamental law upon which the permanent political institutions of the League are built; it is the very foundation upon which must rest the mutual relations of its members. Is it conceivable that we should be content to leave as they stand in this Constitution of ours rights of private war which have been rendered out of date by the great new instrument to which nearly all of us have agreed?In my judgment, the time has come, as the Prime Minister said the other day, to cut out horn the Covenant the dead wood which now remains, and, in order that we may deal with this in some practical form, I am now taking the liberty to read to you a draft resolution which I am submitting to this Assembly : &quot; The Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations :&apos;&apos; Notes with satisfaction the general adhesion of States members of the League of Nations to the pact signed in Paris on the 27th August, 1928, imposing on its signatories the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy and the undertaking to have recourse only to pacific means for, the settlement of their disputes;&apos;&apos; Considers that, in order to take account of the progress thus made in the organisation of peace, it is desirable to re-examine article 12 and article 15 of the Covenant of the League, in order to determine whether it is necessary to make any modifications therein.&quot;[22169] b 3
May I say, in conclusion, that the Assembly wiU note that it is left to the Agenda Committee to determine to which committee this matter should be referred; it will also note that the committee is free to propose the solution which, in its judgment, may seem right  whether immediate action at this present session of the Assembly, or reference to some standing or special committee with a view to action at the Assembly twelve months hence. The British Govern-ment is ready to accept the procedure which may seem wise to the Assembly as a whole. It cares nothing for such details provided the main principle is accepted. Our only purpose is to bring the Covenant into line with the wider outlawry of war to which we have all agreed.I am happy to say that I submit this resolution not only in the name of the British delegation, but also in the names of the delegations of France, Italy, Belgium, Chile and Denmark, and the resolution in principle has also the sympathetic approval of the German delegation.If this resolution could be dealt with on the lines which the British delegation suggests, I believe that we shall be taking as a result one of the most important and one of the most far-reaching steps to convince our peoples that when we signed the Pact of Paris we were determined to begin to build a great edifice of peace which would secure co-operation and goodwill amongst all the nations we represent.No. 3.Viscount Cecil to Mr. A. Henderson.Sir, Geneva, September 25, 1929.I have the honour to submit the following report upon the discussions which took place during the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations upon the question of the relation of the Covenant of the League of Nations to the Pact for the Denunciation of War, signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928.2. This subject was brought to the attention of the Assembly in some detail in your speech at the seventh plenary meeting on the 6th September. In that speech you pointed out that, under the Covenant as it now stands, private war is in certain circumstances legitimate, but that this right of private war had now been abolished by the Pact of Paris. This was not to say that there was a con-tradiction between the Covenant, on the one hand, and the Pact, on the other, but that the Pact had gone beyond the Covenant and had filled the gaps which the Covenant had left open. You then illustrated this fact from the text of the Covenant itself, and urged that the time was now ripe to bring the Covenant into line with a
wider outlawry of war to which so many nations had agreed. You therefore submitted a draft resolution in the following terms : &apos;&apos; The Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations notes with satisfaction the general adhesion of States members of the League of Nations to the Pact signed in Paris on the 27th August, 1928, imposing on its signatories the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy and the undertaking to have recourse only to pacific means for the settlement of their disputes, considers that in order to take account of the progress thus made in the organisation of peace, it is desirable to re-examine article 12 and article 15 of the Covenant of the League in order to determine whether it is necessary to make any modifications therein.&quot;This resolution was submitted not only in the name of the delega-tion of the United Kingdom, but also in the names of the delegations of Belgium, Chile, France and Italy.3. The British draft resolution was considered by the First Committee of the Assembly on the 17th September, together with a draft resolution submitted by the Peruvian delegation in the following terms : &quot; The Assembly shall appoint a committee of five members to report on the form to be adopted for the inclusion of the Kellogg Pact in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and on the alterations necessary therein to give effect to the prohibition of war as an instrument of national policy.&quot;The British resolution was introduced by Sir Cecil Hurst in a speech the official record of which is enclosed.*4. Sir Cecil Hurst said that when the Covenant was being drafted the authors felt that unless certain loopholes were left it would not secure general acceptance. Since the Covenant had come into force, such progress had been made in the organisation of peace as to enable the world to accept the more far-reaching stipulations embodied in the Paris Pact. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom were now, therefore, of opinion that some of the provisions of the Covenant required re-examination. Four changes in the text of the Covenant were required, one principal change in article 12 and one principal change in article 15, with consequential changes in articles 13 and 15. Sir Cecil Hurst proceeded to explain these amendments, copies of which are enclosed.! Article 12 stipulates that if there should arise between members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, then &apos;&apos; they will submit the matter either to arbitration, or to judicial settlement, or to enquiry by the Council,&quot; and the article goes on to say : &apos;&apos; They agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators, or the judicial decision, or the report by the Council.&quot; In order to make this obligation at least as far-reaching as that embodied in the Paris Pact, all that it was* See page 10. j See page 16.[22169] b 4
necessary to do was to stop short at the words &apos;&apos; they will in no case resort to war&apos;&apos; and delete the phrase which permits recourse to, war after three months. Similarly, in article 15 of the Covenant provision was made that, if the Council was unable to arrive at a unanimous decision, the members of the League reserved to them-selves &quot;the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.&quot; This was the so-called gap in the Covenant which left members of the League the right to resort to war in certain events. Such recourse to war was now, however, covered by the terms of article 1 of the Pact of Paris, and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore proposed to close the gap by adding the words &quot;other than resort to war&quot; immediately after the words quoted above.5. Sir Cecil Hurst explained that he had made no mention of two other articles which had frequently been mentioned as requiring amendment if the changes he had suggested were made. These were articles 10 and 16. Article 10 was so differently regarded by members of the League by some as an unreasonably burdensome obligation, and by others as the keystone of the arch of security which the League gave them that it would be safer to leave it alone. As regards article 16, he admitted that, if the obligations of articles 12, 13 and 15 were extended as he proposed, it was clear that the eases in which the members of the League would be called upon to apply sanctions under article 16 would also be extended. On the whole, His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that it was wiser to make this small extension of the obligations involved in article 16 than to confine its application in the amended Covenant to those cases to which it at present applies. To amend it in this sense would be a complicated matter, and would result in the embodiment in the terms of the Covenant of two different sets of obligations, of which one was covered by the sanctions and the other was not.6. Sir Cecil urged that, if possible, the Assembly should adopt these proposals at its present session, but if the committee thought the question so big a one that it ought to be made the subject of study after the Assembly, he would bow to their wishes.7. In the course of the discussion which followed, certain hesitations were expressed by the Danish, Netherlands, Norwegian and Swedish delegates, not, indeed, as to the desirability of closing the gap in the Covenant, upon which all were agreed, but rather upon the method to be pursued. Some delegates felt that, if they were to deal with a matter affecting the terms of the Covenant, it was desirable that they should have time to think it over and, if necessary, communicate with their Governments. Some had doubts as to the precise interpretation to be given to the Pact of Paris. Some thought that what was required was not merely the literal adjustment of the terms in which the Covenant was couched, but the replacement of the provision allowing recourse to war by some other provision.   Some objected to the proposed extension of the
obligation to apply sanctions under article 16. Sir Cecil Hurst&apos;s proposal was, however, strongly supported by the Belgian delegate (M. Bolin), who brushed aside the technical objections of his Scandinavian and Netherlands colleagues by emphasising the moral as opposed to the juridical aspect of the proposal. The Covenant and the Pact covered different ground, and it was desirable to make the present situation with regard to international law concerning war comprehensible to everybody, so that the simplest minds should understand the effect of the obligations which had been assumed. For the sake of the man in the street, it was necessary to solve the apparent paradox by which the League of Nations most of whose members solemnly declared in 1928 that they renounced recourse to war still permits recourse to war in its charter.8. At Sir Cecil Ilursfs suggestion, a sub-committee was set up with the duty of recommending to the Pirst Committee (1) whether or not it was feasible to put the matter through at the present Assembly, or whether it was desirable that the question should be studied after the Assembly was over; and, (2) if the latter, what recommendation should be made as to procedure.9. The sub-committee considered it desirable that the terms of the Covenant should no longer accord to members of the League the right to have recourse to war in cases in which that right had been renounced by the Pact of Paris. The Assembly could not, however, reach a decision at its present session. They proposed that the Council should appoint a committee of eleven to report as to the amendments in the Covenant which are necessary to bring it into harmony with the Pact. This committee would meet in the first quarter of 1930. In the meantime the secretariat would transmit to all members of the League a copy of the amendments proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, together with other relevant papers. The Governments would, therefore, not be obliged to.give their views, but would be able to submit them for the consideration of the committee if they desired. In this way the work of the committee would not be unduly delayed and the Assembly would be in a position to deal with the question at its next session. They therefore proposed the following resolution : &quot; The Assembly,&quot; Taking note of the resolution submitted to it on the 6th September on behalf of various delegations that, in view of the large measure of acceptance obtained by the Pact signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928, whereby the parties renounced war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another, it is desirable that articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations should be re-examined, in order to determine whether it is necessary to make any modifications therein; and&apos;&apos; Taking note also of the resolution proposed by the Peruvian delegation on the 10th September, recommending
that a report should be obtained as to the alterations which were necessary in the Covenant of the League in order to give effect to the prohibitions contained in the Pact of Paris;&apos;&apos; Declares that it is desirable that the terms of the Covenant of the League should not accord any longer to members of the League a right to have recourse to war in cases in which that right has been renounced by the provisions of the Pact of Paris referred to above;&apos;&apos; Instructs the Secretary-General to communicate to all the members of the League a copy of the amendments to the Covenant of the League which have been proposed for this purpose by the British Government, together with such further papers as may be necessary;&quot; Invites the Council to appoint a committee of eleven persons to frame a report as to the amendments in the Covenant of the League which are necessary to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. This committee should meet in the first three months of 1980, and, in the course of its labours, should take into account any replies or observations which have been received from the members of the League by that date. The report of the committee will be submitted to the members of the League in order that such action as may be deemed appropriate may be taken during the meeting of the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly in 1930.&quot;10. This resolution was adopted by the Assembly at its 20th plenary meeting on the 24th September. The discussions leading up to the drafting of this resolution were ably summarised by the rapporteur, M. Pierre Cot (Prance), a copy of whose speech is enclosed.*I have, &amp;c.CECIL.Enclosure 1 in No. 8.Fifth Meeting of the First Committee of the League of Nations, held on Tuesday, September 17, 1929, at 3-30 p.m.Chairman: M.

the subject of bringing the text of the Covenant into conformity with the text of the Pact signed at Paris last summer, which came into :force at the beginning of the present year. By the terms of the Paris Pact, its signatories pledged themselves to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. The obligations thus assumed went somewhat farther than the provisions of the Covenant. It was now ten years since the Covenant came into force, and at the time it was drawn up it was not possible to embody in it obligations so far-reaching as those accepted in the Pact of Paris last year. That such obligations would now be accepted was shown by the greater measure of adhesion the Paris Pact had received.Because the British resolution involved some modification of the Covenant, he trusted the Assembly would not think that the people of the United Kingdom were in any way discontented with the, terms of that instrument. The wonderful thing was not that there was now something to correct in the terms of the Covenant, in the light of the experience of the last ten years, but that the progress made since the Covenant came into force had been so great as to enable the world to accept the more far-reaching stipulations embodied in this Paris Pact.When the Covenant was drawn up it was felt that, unless certain loopholes were left, it would not secure general acceptance. The intention wras not that members of the League should resort to war by taking advantage of these loopholes, but it was felt that, if the obligations of the Covenant extended to the cases in which war was more likely to arise, that was all that could then be achieved.The Government of the United Kingdom were now of opinion that some of the provisions of the Covenant required re-examination. Article 12 stipulated that, if there should arise between members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, then &apos;&apos; they will submit the matter either to arbitration, or judicial settlement, or to enquiry by the Council,&quot; and the article went on to say: &quot; They agree in no case to resort to&apos;war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council.&quot; The right to go to war after those three months had elapsed was not excluded. The framers of the Covenant thought that if they could prevent war during those three months it would be stopped altogether, since public opinion on both sides would ensure a peaceful settlement. Beyond that those who drew up the Covenant feared to go, lest the instrument should be regarded as Utopian.The great majority of the States had now, however, accepted an overriding obligation in no circumstances to resort to war, and it was clear that the obligation in article 12 was less far-reaching than that. It therefore seemed to the British Government that steps should be taken to make the obligation under article 12 at least as far-reaching as that embodied in the Paris Pact. For that purpose the change required was small. Down to the words &quot;or to the enquiry by the Council&quot; no change was required, and after
that the text should be altered to read &quot; and they agree that they will in no ease resort to war.&quot; That undertaking would be precisely in line with the obligation embodied in article 2 of the Kellogg Pact, which stipulated that &quot; the high contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by peaceful means.&quot; The members of the League would continue to agree that &apos;&apos; if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to rupture &apos;&apos; then &apos;&apos; they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council,&quot; and they would agree not to go to war.If an amendment of that sort were made and for States which had accepted the Pact of Paris that modification would involve no change in their obligations-it would involve two minor consequential amendments in other provisions of the Covenant. Article IS stipulated that the members of the League agreed that whenever any dispute arose between them which they recognised to be suitable for submission to arbitration or judicial settlement, and which could not be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they would submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration or judicial settlement. The fourth paragraph of the article said: &quot;The members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and that they will not resort to war against a member of the League which complies therewith.&quot; It continued: &quot;In the event of. any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.&quot; What operation could that central phrase of the paragraph possess if there was already in existence for those members of the League, embodied in the Pact of Paris, an obligation not to use war as an instrument of national policy, and if they consented to a modification of article 12 of the Covenant to the effect that if there was a dispute it should in no wise be made the excuse for recourse to war? Consequently that central phrase of the fourth paragraph of article IS ceased to be useful, and he submitted that it might be amended to read : &quot; The members of the League agree that they will carry out in good faith any award or decision that may be rendered, and in the event of any failure to carry out such an award :Or decision the Council shall propose what steps shall be taken &apos;   to give effect thereto.&quot;   ;A second consequential amendment would be that in the sixth paragraph of article 15 an alteration would have to be made. At the same time, that provision could not be amended by the simple method he had suggested with regard to the fourth&apos; paragraph of article 18, because there was an essential difference between the two proposals. In the case of a submission of a justiciable dispute to a body which could give a binding decision there was
the obligation to accept the decision which was recognised in the opening phrase of article 13; but when States were submitting to the conciliatory proceeding of the Council there was not, and he did not think there could be, any similar obligation to accept the recommendations of the Council. Just as in the existing sixth paragraph of article 15 States were only obliged to accept the unanimous report to the extent that they undertook not to go to war with the State which complied with it, so he submitted that in the altered form all that it would be possible to provide would, be that if a report of the Council was unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more parties to the dispute, the members of the League agreed that as against any party to the dispute which complied with the recommendations of the Council they would take no action which was inconsistent with its terms. It was unnecessary there to oblige them not to go to war. That obligation would already have been embodied in the suggested amendment to article 12, which would bind them not merely not to go to war for a period of three months, but not to go to war at all.The second main modification which he suggested was necessary, in the terms of the Covenant in order to bring it into harmony, with the Pact of Paris was this. In article 15 of the Covenant provision was made that if the Council was unable to arrive at a unanimous decision the members of the League reserved to them-, selves the right to take such action as they should consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice. That was the provision which had been so often described as the gap in the Covenant, leaving members of the League the right to resort to war in certain events. But the circumstances in which they would resort to war would be covered by the terms of article 1 of the Pact of Paris. They would be resorting to war as an instrument of national policy. The amendment which he submitted ought to be made to that provision of the Covenant was that if the Council failed to reach a report which was unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League reserved to themselves the right to take such action as they should consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice other than a resort to war. There might be many other actions which could be so taken.Those were the formal modifications which it seemed to his Government were required in the terms of the Covenant in view of the fact that a major obligation had now been accepted by most States when they became parties to the Pact of Paris.Some minds might be troubled by the fact that membership of the. League. was not coincident with the parties to the Pact of Paris. That was true, but at the same time the number of the States which were members of the League and which had not accepted the obligations of the Pact of Paris was not large, and they were in most cases he hoped in all States which had been deterred from announcing their acceptance of the Pact of Paris
by constitutional reasons. For the vast majority of the members of the League the obligations of the Pact of Paris had already become a reality.The committee would observe that he had made no mention of two articles as requiring amendment which, in discussion, had frequently been mentioned as being articles that would require amendment if the changes he had suggested were made. The first of these was article 10, providing for the preservation of the existing political independence of all members of the League. He did not think this article required modification by reason of the acceptance of the Pact of Paris; and to touch article 10 would be very unwise, or even dangerous. Since the Covenant came into force there had been two camps or groups which held somewhat divergent views on the subject of article 10. Some States thought that the burden it imposed upon members of the League was so heavy that it was unreasonable to ask States to accept it, and there had been proposals for the elimination of article 10 altogether. On the other hand, there were States which looked to article 10 as the keystone of the arch of security which the League gave them, and who would view with dismay any attempt whatever to weaken its terms. In the presence of views so divergent he ventured to think it would be far better not to think of touching article 10.The second article of which he had made no mention, because his Government thought no change should be made in it, was article 16, the article providing for sanctions. It was clear from that article that the members of the League only undertook to apply those sanctions if there was violation of articles 12, 13 and 15. If the obligations of articles 12, 13 and 15 were extended, it was clear that the cases in which the members of the League would be called upon to apply sanctions would also be extended. Consequently the suggested modifications did, in a sense, increase the burden which membership of the League imposed upon its members. On the whole his Government thought that that small extension of the obligations involved in article 16 was the wisest course to take. It would lead to great complication if it were sought to embody in the terms of the Covenant two different sets of obligations, of which one was covered by the sanctions and the other was not. If, for instance, under article 12 as it now stood a State waited for three months before resorting to war and then went to war, it did not violate article 12, and, consequently, there was no obligation upon other members of the League to apply sanctions against it. If, on the other hand, article 12 was modified in the way he had indicated, and the obligation to refrain from resorting to war became indefinite in duration, and the State went to war four months after the award or decision, then, if the amendment was accepted, it would go to war in circumstances that would oblige other members of the League to apply sanctions to it. But this extension of the obligations of article 16 seemed to his delegation to be no more than a theoretical extension and not a practical one.   The application of sanctions was only a burden
if other States did in fact resort to war. The more the possibility of war was reduced, the less possibility there was of having to apply sanctions, and, consequently, the less onerous did the burden of sanctions become.It would be seen that the modifications he had suggested as necessary in the Covenant as the result of the acceptance of the Pact of Paris covered but a very modest field. They implied no radical revision of the charter which bound all the States members of the League. They were but minor corrections, which it seemed reasonable to make in view of the progress that the world had made in the course of the last ten years.If he was right in thinking that the field in which amendments were proposed was modest, and if the terms of the amendments which he had indicated seemed to be adequate to achieve their purpose, what reason wras there why acceptance by the Assembly of these proposals should not be secured in the course of the Assembly which was still in being? He had read with great interest the corresponding proposal that had been put forward by the Peruvian delegation. The Peruvian delegation had proposed that a committee of five should be set up to consider what amend-ments were necessary in the terms of the Covenant in order to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. He quite under-stood, if the generality of the members of the committee thought this question was so big a one, that it ought to be made the subject of study after the Assembly, that it ought to be committed to some body which would have an opportunity to deal with the question with patience. If that was the general view of the committee, the members of the British delegation would quite understand it and would be perfectly ready to accept it, but their own view was that these amendments which he had suggested were so modest in their nature, they covered a field so restricted, that.in reality it would not be either difficult or unreasonable for the members of the Assembly to put this matter through right away. After all, it was now ten years since the League was started. Great progress had been made in the course of that decade, and would it not be an admirable opportunity to mark their sense of the progress which had been made by bringing the terms of the Covenant up to date? A phrase had been used by his own Prime Minister in the course of his speech before the Assembly when it was said that the moment had come to cut away the dead wood from the Covenant. It had occurred to him that perhaps the phrase might create in the minds of some an idea that they thought the Covenant a dying tree in which dead wood was beginning to appear. Let him suggest rather to the committee that the committee should consider that what was wanted was the elimination only of boughs of that tree which had ceased to be useful because the tree had grown so high that the lower boughs ceased to operate. He hoped at the conclusion of the meeting that it might be possible either for a general preponderance of view to have been expressed in favour either of appointing or recommending the appointment of some body to go into the question after the Assembly had met, or, on the other
hand, he hoped that there might have been expressed a generality of opinion in favour of some more immediate effort at amendment of the Covenant so as to put the whole business through in the course of the coming Assembly.Enclosure 2 in No. 3.Proposed Amendments.Article 12 (1) to be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; The members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree that they will in no case resort to war.&quot;Article 13 (4) to be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; The members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.&quot;Article 15 (6) to be amended to read as follows: -&quot; If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League agree that as against any party to the dispute that complies with the recommendations of the report they will take no action which is inconsistent with its terms.&quot;Article 15 (7) to be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice other than a resort to war.&quot;Enclosure 3 in No. 3. Speech by M. Pierre Cot (France), Rapporteur. (Translation.)Thk signature and ratification of the Paris Pact by the majority of the members of the League of Nations has raised an important problem before public opinion. Last year this question was brought before the Assembly, and the hon. delegate for Greece, M. Politis, and the Lithuanian delegation put forward a first proposal having in view the bringing into harmony of the Covenant of the League with the Pact of Paris.   Since then this idea has gained ground,
Imd on the occasion of the present Assembly the British delegation, followed in this by other delegations, asked that an examination should be made of articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant of the League in order to see how they could be brought into harmony with the Pact of Paris. On the other hand, the Peruvian delegation put forward a proposal suggesting the appointment of a committee of five members to study what modifications would be necessary in the Covenant in order to embody in that instrument the provisions of the Pact for the Benuneiation of &quot;War. The First Committee thus had a two-fold problem before it: First of all the question of principle that is to say, whether it was expedient to contemplate amending the Covenant of the League of Nations in such a manner as had been proposed. The second question was one of method that is to say, how best to proceed to amend the Covenant supposing it was decided that amendment was necessary.On these two questions I would desire, briefly summarising the discussions in the First Committee, to say a word.On the matter of principle no difficulty arose. No one contended against the idea of modifying the Covenant of the League of Nations. On the other hand, whilst there was no legal necessity to modify the Covenant, following the signature of the Pact of Paris for the Renunciation of War, because the Briand-Kellogg Pact does not conflict with the Covenant, but may be considered to be its prolongation or extension, other States which have signed the Covenant and also the Paris Pact are in a legal position quite clearly defined by the combination of those two instruments.But although there was no legal necessity to amend the -Covenant, there was a moral necessity, to use the words of one of the members of the committee. The issue is that of prohibiting the recourse to war. It seemed undesirable that in this connexion it should be only the jurists who were able to be clear as to the position, and what was wanted was that the man in the street should also be able to appreciate where matters stood. For the sake of the man in the street, therefore, it was felt that we should remove the apparent paradox of the League of Nations most of whose members solemnly declared in 1928 that they renounced recourse to war still allowing recourse to war in its charter.There was a further reason a psychological reason for modification of the Covenant by the insertion therein of the Briand-Kellogg Pact as a means of measuring the advance made in the course of ten years. In 1919 the authors of the Covenant did not dare to go to the length of prohibiting war entirely, and so a compromise was reached between the desire to banish war from international relations and the old concept of national&apos; sovereignty as including the right to resort to war. Since that time inter-national co-operation, thanks to the League of Nations, has become the law of international life, and so we have now come round to the view that it would be wrong to retain in the Covenant the right to go- to war-which has been renounced.The principle being thus agreed to, there remained the question of method.   The Assembly may perhaps ask us why we did not
seek to amend the Covenant and come before you to-day with definite suggestions as to such amendment. This problem, however, on examination proved exceedingly delicate. Certain delegates had misgivings; some of them felt that if they were to deal with a matter affecting the terms of the Covenant it was desirable that they should have time to think it over and, if necessary, communicate with their Governments. Moreover, the Pact of Paris, although a very concise document, is perhaps not as simple as it appears at first sight. The drafting of this instrument was preceded by negotiations which, while they did not restrict, certainly dbfncu its scope. The object must be to embody in the Covenant the prohibition of war as it stands at the present moment by virtue of the Pact of Paris.There were in the committee certain slightly divergent tendencies, but in my view it was easy to reconcile them. Some members thought that all that was required was a literal adjustment of the terms in which the Covenant is couched. Others thought that, when the provision allowing recourse to war was taken out it should be replaced by something else, and so they contemplated the possibility of abolishing the difference provided for in article 15 between the recommendations of the Council made by a unanimous vote and those made by a majority vote.It will be seen that the intricacy of tbe issue revealed itself at once. The First Committee, therefore, although agreed as to the principle, was unable to come before the Assembly and submit definite texts. It considered what would be the appropriate means of achieving the end desired, and it felt that the best means would be to set up a committee to frame a report as to the necessary amendments in the Covenant to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. The question arose whether that committee should begin its work before all the Governments had been consulted. We felt, however, that if the work was to be preceded by an obligatory consultation of all the Governments, the effect might be to delay the work unduly, and that we should have to ask the next Assembly once again to wait. Therefore, we decided to propose that the Council should appoint a committee of eleven members, which would meet in the first quarter of 1930, and, further, that the Secretariat should in the meanwhile transmit to all members of the League a copy of the amendments to the Covenant which had been proposed for this purpose by the British Government, together with such further papers as might be necessary. Thus, whilst Govern-ments are not obliged to give their views, they will be in a position to study the matter and to bring forward any suggestions. The committee of eleven, having the necessary material and the time, which we lacked, will be able to prepare the necessary text in order to bring the Covenant of the League into harmony with the Pact of Paris. Therefore, we hope that next year, the question having been carefully pondered and the text carefully studied, it will be possible for the Assembly to have before it definite proposals which will enable it to bring these two great instruments into harmony one with another.
No. 4.Report of the Comviittee for the Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations in order to bring it into Harmony with the Pact of Paris. March 8, 1980 (League of Nations document).The committee appointed by the Council at its session of January 1930 in execution of the Assembly&apos;s resolution of the 24th September, 1929,* met at Geneva from the 25th February to the 5th March, 1930.The committee consisted of the following members : M. Antoniade (Roumania). M. Cot (France).M. von Billow (Germany). Viscount Cecil of Chelwood(Great Britain). M. Cobian (Spain). M. Cornejo (Peru).M. Ito (Japan). M. Scialoja (Italy). M. Sokal (Poland). M. Unden (Sweden). Dr. Woo Kaiseng (China)M. Scialoja was appointed Chairman.The committee first examined the conditions which governed its task. It appeared that, putting on one side the political aspects of the question, all the other aspects had to be considered in order to draft the amendments necessary to bring the League Covenant into harmony with the Pact for the Renunciation of War.The committee was not called upon to enquire whether it was expedient to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations. This question has already been answered by the Assembly, since the resolution of the 24th September, 1929, declares &quot;that it is. desirable that the terms of the Covenant of the League should not accord any longer to members of the League a right to have recourse to war in cases in which that right has been renounced by the provisions of the Pact of Paris.&quot;In order to conform to this decision, the Council could not propose to the States any amendments the principle of which was not included in the Pact of Paris. The members of the League of Nations which are bound by the Pact of Paris must preserve all the rights which are theirs under the latter instrument.Finally, the committee had to indicate the consequences ensuing from the various amendments it proposed. In the light of the eommittee&apos;s report and proposals, the Assembly will say whether it accepts these amendments or whether, on the other hand, it prefers tc reject them by reason of the consequences they involve.The committee has not confined itself to reproducing the terms of the Pact of Paris in the Covenant of the League of Nations. This method would have had serious disadvantages. The League Covenant, under some of its articles, reserves the right to go to war, and it is essential to eliminate this right wherever it appears. Otherwise, there would be undesirable contradictions between the new provisions that were added and the old provisions that were left unmodified.* See page 38.
;. Furthermore, the members of the committee considered th&amp;fM they; could not confine themselves to deleting the provisions which^ authorise war. The Covenant of the League of Nations has an organic character which must be maintained. It takes account of all the circumstances which may arise in international life and thus forms an articulated whole the symmetry of which must be respected. Resort to war being henceforward prohibited, its place must be taken by methods of pacific settlement in order to ensure the settlement of disputes.Prohibition of war involves certain legal consequences which the committee has considered. At the same time, it has not felt it desirable to give a complete interpretation of the Pact of Paris. Some members of the League of Nations have not acceded to the Pact of Paris; on the other hand, some signatories of that pact are not members of the League. In these circumstances, the committee thought that, even if it were led by the necessities of the case to render more precise the meaning of certain provisions in the Pact of Paris, the interpretation thus given could clearly not affect States which were not members of the League of Nations and, even as regards the members of the League, could not constitute an interpretation of general application but would relate only to the matters dealt with in the amended articles.The. committee calls attention to the political difficulty which may arise in bringing the two instruments into concordance with one another. The establishment of such concordance must not be allowed to react disadvantageous?/ upon the relations between the League of Nations and certain signatories of the Pact of Paris. It would be equally regrettable if those members of the League of Nations which have not signed the Pact of Paris were to raise objections of principle against the amendments which were proposed.Similarly, the committee decided to touch the provisions of the League Covenant as little as possible. Its task is limited. It is not required to make a general revision of the Covenant, but simply to ensure harmony between the two instruments. Accordingly, the committee resolved as far as possible to retain the formulae and actual words of the League Covenant.The committee agreed to propose the amendments which, together with comments thereon, are given below : Preamble.The committee proposes a slight modification in the Preamble of the Covenant of the League of Nations.   Instead of:&quot;In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war,&quot;the. committee proposes : - .     &quot;In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security  by accepting  the obligation not to resort to war.&quot;
m One of the members of the committee proposed that the actual Text of articles 1 and 2 of the Pact of Paris should be inserted in the Preamble to the Covenant. This proposal was connected with an amendment to article 12, which will be discussed under article 16. The committee, however, did not concur in this view. It thought that the proposed insertion was unnecessary and that it would be better to define the scope of the obligations laid down by the Pact of Paris by modifying certain articles of the Covenant of the League of Nations.In the committee&apos;s opinion, it was unnecessary to give in the Preamble any further definition of the extent and meaning of the obligation assumed by the States. The Preamble should retain the quite general character given to it by its authors. The pro-hibition of resort to war will be formulated in more precise terms in article 12.Article 12, paragraph 1. The committee adopted the following text:&apos;&apos; The members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will only employ pacific means for its settlement.&apos;&apos; If the disagreement continues, the dispute shall be submitted either to arbitration or judicial settlement, or to-enquiry by the Council. The members of the League agree that they will in no case resort to war for the solution of their dispute.&quot;1, The first question examined in connexion with this article was that of condemnation of war.    The committee considered, whether it ought to employ a general formula absolutely condemning all war.  It decided, for two reasons, not to accept certain suggestions made to it in this sense.The committee thought that it must remain faithful to its method and restrict itself to bringing article 12 into harmony with the Pact of Paris. What is the article&apos;s sphere of application? It provides for the settlement of disputes, likelyto lead to a rupture. Consequently, in conformity with article 2 of the Pact of Paris, it is sufficient to declare that &quot; the members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they will only employ pacific means for its settlement.&quot;Any contradiction between the Pact and the Covenant, in regard either to form or to substance, is thereby removed.On the other hand, the statement of the fact that the Pact of Paris simply condemns war &quot;as an instrument of national policy, without prohibiting resistance to aggression or the execution of international police measures, cannot be regarded as an endeavour to interpret that Pact. In these circumstances, any formula which was too general must have been accompanied by comments and reservations which would have modified the structure of article 12.One member of the committee made a reservation regarding the
insertion in article 12 of this prohibition of resort to war, on accouife of the consequences which such an amendment might have in connexion with the application of sanctions. This question will be dealt with in connexion with article 16.Certain members of the committee drew its attention to the question whether, in the case of resistance to aggression or the execution of international police measures, the laws of war (jus belli) would continue applicable. In such circumstances, it might, indeed, be doubtful whether the case was one of war properly so-called. In the committee&apos;s opinion, whatever name may be given to such operations, the rules of the laws of war would remain applicable.2. The various forms of pacific procedure which might be employed to settle the dispute were next discussed.The committee did not desire to limit the free action of the parties. They may obviously, as in the past, resort to all pacific means which seem to them likely to secure the settlement of the dispute. Clearly, if the dispute can be settled by means of diplomatic negotiations, mediation, or conciliation, for instance, there is every reason for congratulation. But provision must be made for the possibility of such proceedings failing or not being resorted to at all. In such cases, all parties, whatever the attitude of the other party may be, should have reserved to them the right to resort either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council.Article 12, paragraph 2.Should paragraph 2 of article 12 be omitted?Certain members of the committee thought that the modifications made in the first &quot;paragraph materially altered the structure of article 12. They therefore asked whether the existence of paragraph 2 was not bound up with the provision in paragraph 1 of a time-limit of three months during which war was prohibited. All resort to war having been eliminated and the time-limit having accordingly disappeared, they saw no reason why the provisions of paragraph 2 should be retained.In this connexion it was stated that, the term &quot; reasonable time &quot; was not definite enough and could therefore not be as effective as might be desirable.The committee nevertheless decided to retain paragraph 2 of article 12 as it stands. This paragraph is in no way incompatible with the Pact of Paris. It would be preferable, therefore, not to delete it. Moreover, it expresses a general idea which it is necessary to retain. It lays stress upon the duty to take rapid action which is incumbent on the authorities who have to render the decision as well as on the Council when making a report in accordance with article 15.The committee did not think that the grounds put forward for the deletion of the term &quot;reasonable time&quot; were sufficient. It is impossible in a general provision to lay down a definite time-limit, for the disputes which may arise between two States are from their very nature too different and too complex for the same time-limit to
e applicable to all of them. All that can be asked, therefore, is that the award should be given as rapidly as possible. This is the meaning of the present text and there seems no reason for modifying it.Article 18, paragraph 4.&quot; The members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award or decision that may be rendered and that they will not take any action against any member of the League which complies therewith.&apos;&apos; In the event of any failure to carry out such award or decision, the Council shall propose what measures of all kinds should be taken to give effect thereto; the votes of the repre-sentatives of the parties shall not be counted.&quot;The committee drafted the above text after examining a number of suggestions.1. The committee has omitted the mention of recourse to war in the first sentence of article 13, paragraph 4. The members of the League undertake to refrain from any action against a State which complies with any award or decision that has been rendered.The proposed text obviously secures to States the right themselves to proceed with the execution of awards or decisions given in their favour, without, however, leaving them the right to resort to war. Certain members of the committee, however, made a reservation on the latter point.2. The right of going to war being abolished, some members of the committee asked that the Council should be given the necessary powers to ensure execution of the award or decision. They proposed that the Council should be able to determine by a btmple- majority what measures should be taken to give effect to awards or decisions that had been rendered. To support their case, they argued that the Council would not be required to take a fresh decision on the substance of the dispute, but only to ensure the execution of an award or decision which had already become legally final and binding. Accordingly, they thought that the Council should be given the powers necessary to ensure execution in all circumstances and that the rule of unanimity should be excluded. They added that this rule might involve serious disadvantages, since the opposition of a single State represented on the Council would be sufficient to prevent the execution of a judicial decision or arbitral aw:ard.The committee recognised the gravity of the question; it agreed that decisions or awards rendered by a judicial or arbitral authority ought to be executed; at the same time it was unable to accept the proposal put forward.On the one hand, it thought that an award rendered had so much authority that, in practice, a State would be very unlikely to refuse to comply with it. The Council&apos;s intervention in such matters will therefore be exceptional.   States have agreed to carry out in full
good faith any award or decision that may be renderedl Consequently, it is to be presumed that awards or judicial decisions will be executed in due course. An interested party will only appeal to the Council if it has been unable to obtain execution of the award. In such a case, the Council&apos;s obvious duty is to take all the necessary measures to cause effect to be given to the award or judicial decision.On the other hand, it is in virtue of article 5 that the Council will decide to vote by a majority or unanimously according as the methods which it adopts to ensure execution of the award or decision are, or are not, matters of procedure. Article 5 enunciates one of the fundamental principles of the Covenant and must remain applicable.Nevertheless, the committee thought it essential to specify that the votes of the parties will not be counted when it is a case of prescribing measures of execution to be taken against a recalcitrant State.Finally, the majority of the committee desired that the attention of the Assembly and the Council should be called to the necessity of ensuring that effect is given to awards or judicial decisions in all circumstances whatsoever. The whole authority of the League of Nations might be affected if an indisputable right derived from an award or judicial decision which had become legally final and binding could continue to be violated with impunity.If, therefore, the Council or Assembly think that, from the political point of view, the provisions of article 13 are too weak, they must take all the necessary steps to strengthen them. This question might be referred by the Council for closer study to the Committee on Arbitration and Security.3. The committee&apos;s attention was drawn to the expression &quot;shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect.to the award.&quot; Some members asked that the word &quot;determine&quot; should be substituted for the word &quot;propose.&quot;In support of this contention they put forward two arguments: In the first place, they thought that the Council would be called upon not merely to propose measures to the members of the League, but also to take steps itself (censure of a recalcitrant State, appointment of a committee of enquiry,&apos; &amp;e.)v&apos;&apos; Iid the second place, they thought that the term &quot;propose &quot; was not sufficiently imperative.The committee did not endorse this view. It considered that, except for serious reasons, it was preferable not to alter the actual words of the Covenant, the use of the expression &apos;&apos; the Council shall propose &quot; not being any obstacle to the steps which the Council might be called upon to take.So far as regards the extent to which the measures prescribed would be obligatory, the term employed appeared to be sufficiently explicit. Furthermore, the Council would here be addressing itself to the States which were not parties to the dispute. It could not issue orders to these States. It must confine itself to indicating the measures of coercion which would be most effective for the purpose of inducing the recalcitrant State to comply with the award or decision.   The latter State does, indeed, become the object of an
Pctual order; but this order derives its authority, not from the CouneiTs decision, but from the award or judicial decision.4. Lastly, the committee decided that the Council should be left the greatest possible freedom in its choice of methods for ensuring (he execution of awards or judicial decisions. No limits can be laid down. Everything depends on the circumstances. The Council must be relied on to act with the necessary prudence and firmness.Article 15 :   General Observations.This article gave rise to amendments and observations upon its sixth and seventh paragraphs. A new paragraph, -7bis, has been added. The new paragraph provides a procedure which is applicable both in the case covered by paragraph 6 and in that covered by paragraph 7.The general principle by which the committee has been guided has been that the elimination of resort to war should have as its consequence the extension of the procedure of pacific settlement. Otherwise, war would only be forbidden by the law and in practice there would be a danger that, in default of any other solution, States would be led to adopt a warlike attitude.Article 15, paragraph 6.The committee adopted the following text: &apos;&apos; If the report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the members of the League agree that they will comply with the recommendations of the report. If the Councils recommendation is not carried out, the Council shall propose suitable measures to give it effect.&quot;1. Paragraph 6 of article 15 implicitly stated that in certain circumstances war was lawful against a State which did not make its conduct conform to the solutions indicated in the Council&apos;s report. The members of the League merely agreed that they would not go to war with any party&apos; to&apos; the dispute which complied with the recommendations of the report.The committee has, of course, struck out this possibility of settling the conflict by war.On the other hand, paragraph 6 gave some degree of force to a report of the Council which was unanimously adopted, but the parties to the dispute were not obliged to comply with the report. If the report was not satisfactory to any of the parties, a solution of the conflict by force remained possible, at least after the expira-tion of the three months&apos; period provided for in article 12.Here again the committee desired to eliminate all possibility of war.2. The draft proposed by the committee gives an obligatory character to the recommendations of a report which is unanimously
adopted. The members of the League agree to comply with tl \ recommendations of such a report.No doubt the Council&apos;s report does not have the character of a judicial decision or arbitral award which is legally final and binding. The committee, however, felt that a report which was unanimously adopted was of so great authority that it ought to prevail over the individual will of the States.Moreover, before taking a final decision, the Council can always make to the parties any suggestions which it considers desirable. Before taking a decision, it can and should give advice. It would only take a final decision in eases where it was compelled to overcome the resistance of the States concerned. Such a decision cannot be final unless it is obligatory. The Council, therefore, remains perfectly free to decide whether it will finally settle the dispute or whether it prefers to make a mere attempt at conciliation in the unanimous recommendation which it adopts.3. The obligatory character of the Council&apos;s recommendation having thus been made clear, the question of its execution arose.The committee felt that an obligatory decision should not be left in danger of not being executed. The arguments which were used in connexion with the new text of article 13 are here fully applicable. Whatever be the nature of the conflict considered, tho whole authority of the League of Nations would be impaired if a recommendation unanimously voted by the Council should remain a dead letter. Various forms of dilatory manoeuvring would, moreover, be encouraged. If the Councils unanimous recom-mendation could again be disputed, States would have an interest in delaying and in waiting in the hope that a change in tho composition of the Council might produce a solution with which they would be better satisfied. In order to confirm the principle of the permanent character of the organs of the League of Nations, it is indispensable that a decision which has been declared to be final should not be capable of being further questioned, and this implies that the decision niust be executed.It is, of course, very unlikely that a State would refuse to comply with the recommendations: of a report which had been unanimously voted. The committee had, however, to take such a case into account. Accordingly, it has been made the duty of the Council, in the event of any failure to carry out the recommenda-tions of its report, to propose whatever measures may be appropriate to ensure that effect is given to those recommendations.Some members of the committee raised an objection at this point. They argued that a recommendation was not in the true sense a decision and could not be entirely assimilated to an arbitral award or judicial decision. They maintained that the Council&apos;s duty was to endeavour to avoid war rather than to secure the execution of the recommendations of its report.The majority of the committee did not adopt this point of view. They thought, however, that the wording to be proposed should mark the distinction between the unanimous decision of the Council
phd an arbitral award or judicial decision. At the same time they intended to make it clear that the Council&apos;s decision and the arbitral award or judicial decision are both alike to be executed.It is unnecessary to say that States may always use their own means for obtaining the execution of the recommendations made by the Council, subject always to their not being entitled to resort to war. It is only if they fail in their attempts to secure such execution that they will ask the Council to intervene and take any measures that may be necessary.Article 15, paragraph 7.The committee adopted the following text: &quot; If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, it shall examine the procedure best suited to meet the case and recommend it to the parties.&quot;Paragraph 7 of article 15 contained a serious lacuna which has often been pointed out. If the Council failed to reach a report which was unanimously voted, the members of the League retained full liberty of action. They could, in particular, resort to war for the protection of their rights and interests after the lapse of three months.1. The first duty of the committee was to eliminate such resort to war. The committee thought it unnecessary to repeat the general prohibition contained in the new draft of article 12. Article 12 serves as an introduction to articles 13 and 15. States have, in all circumstances, lost the right to make war in order to secure the settlement of their disputes.2. Some members of the committee would have desired that a binding decision should always be capable of being reached in the case covered by paragraph 7. They saw no other means of attaining this result than that of making arbitration compulsory in the last resort. The procedure which they contemplated was summed up in the three following propositions : a new examination of the case by the Council; an obligatory consultation of the Permanent Court of International Justice upon the legal points material to the dispute; an arbitration organised by the Council. Under this system, after a fresh attempt at conciliation and after a thorough study of the legal issues, the Council would have referred the dispute to an arbitral tribunal whose decision would have been binding upon the parties.The committee as a whole felt that the true solution for the case covered by paragraph 7 was to be found in the- accession of the Members of the League of Nations to the General Act of Arbitration. It would have been glad if it had been possible to settle the question by a reference to that instrument. Such a course was, however, rendered the more impossible by the fact
1. Two considerations underlie this draft.that only a very small number of States have hitherto accedU;,) U to the General Act. Other accessions are, no doubt, contemplated or announced. Such accessions may, however, be accompanied by reservations. In present circumstances it does not seem that the members of the League are prepared to submit all their disputes, without any exception, to compulsory arbitration.The committee thought that it was a serious matter to attempt to settle a question as complicated as that of compulsory arbitration in a few lines. Accordingly, it directed its efforts towards a more modest solution.3. The committee first examined a different proposal, which consisted in referring the case successively to the Permanent Court of International Justice and to the Assembly. As will be mentioned below, the first of these suggestions was adopted by the committee (see paragraph 7bis); but it seemed undesirable to turn the Assembly into a kind of court of appeal, since it is very difficult to convene it immediately. The Council must, therefore, be left free to refer a dispute to the Assembly as already provided by article 15, paragraph 9, without this procedure being made the general rule. Moreover, under paragraph 9, any party to a dispute has the right to bring the dispute before the Assembly.4. The committee has, however, not renounced the idea of giving the Council the duty of watching over the final settlement of the dispute. It has merely felt that it was not desirable to make any particular procedure obligatory. It leaves the Council with the task of examining what course would be the most appropriate to the case and of making recommendations to the parties accordingly. The Council can recommend arbitration, resort to the Permanent Court of International Justice or any other proceedings for pacific settlement of the dispute. If the parties submit their dispute to arbitration in accordance with the Council&apos;s recommendation, a decision will, of course, be given which will have become legally and finally binding and which will be executed under the conditions contained in article 13.This solution of the problem is doubtless inadequate. The committee does not intend to disguise this fact. In order to remedy its defects as far as possible, the committee has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the legal issues can, in all circumstances, be settled.   This is the object of paragraph Ibis.Article 15, paragraph 7bis.The committee adopted the following text: &quot;At any stage of the examination the Council may, either at the request of one of the parties or on its own initiative, ask the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion on points of law relating to the dispute. Such application shall not require a unanimous vote by the Council.&quot;
P On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure respect for inter-national law, even in a political conflict. On the other hand; the solution of any kind of dispute will be greatly facilitated if the issues of law raised by the parties are settled by the competent authority.How and by whom should the opinion on the points of law be asked ?The Council is alone competent to ask the Courfs advice. It was, however, desired to give certain guarantees to the parties to the dispute. It is accordingly stated that the opinion is to be asked by the Council &quot; either on its own initiative or at the request of one of the parties.&quot; Some members of the committee desired to go further in this direction. They wished that it should be obligatory for the opinion of the Court to be requested if one of the parties so desired.It was felt that this proposal was not obviously necessary. If it would be of real importance for the solution of the dispute that the advisory opinion should be requested, the majority of the Council will be very ready to consult the Court, if so requested by one of the parties. Moreover, it was thought necessary to preserve the special character of the procedure of advisory opinions and avoid the danger of allowing a confusion to arise between that procedure and the ordinary jurisdiction of the Court. The procedure of advisory opinions is one which can be resorted to only by the Council or the Assembly. This consideration caused the committee not to go beyond the measures indicated above.2. Nevertheless, the majority of the members of the committee thought that, in order to render the asking of an advisory opinion easier, the Council should be given the possibility of. making a request for an advisory opinion by a decision adopted by a simple majority. The committee has left entirely on one side the question whether, as a general rule, a request for an advisory opinion requires unanimity or may be made by a simple majority. It has merely intended to make it clear that, in the course of the proceedings of enquiry which take place under article 15, such opinions would be asked for by a majority decision.In the intention of the committee, the provision in question, being peculiar to article 15, could not be used as an argument in either sense in the discussion which has arisen upon this question. Some members of the committee, however, formulated an express reservation on this question.3. Some members of the committee expressed the fear that the extension of the use of requests for advisory opinions might.present certain political disadvantages on account of the new provisions relating to this procedure. They accordingly proposed that the advisory opinion might be asked &quot;from the Permanent Court of International Justice or, failing the Court, from a committee of jurists.&quot;The committee thought that this was a purely political question which it was not competent to examine.  It confined itself to drawing
so the attention of the Council and of the Assembly to the consequence!^: which may be involved in the manner in which paragraph Ibis is drafted..Article 15, paragraph 8.One of the members of the committee proposed to strike out paragraph 8 of article 15 for the purpose of establishing closer concordance between the Covenant and the Pact of Paris. He argued that the Pact of Paris provides that &quot; the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts, of whatever nature or of what-ever origin they may be, shall never be sought except by pacific means.&quot; It was logical not to leave any exception to this genera! rule. In so far as a dispute which arises &quot; out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of a party &apos;&apos; may put the peace of the world in peril, it was necessary to ensure the settlement of the dispute.The committee did not feel that there was any formal contra-diction between the text of paragraph 8 and that of the Pact of Paris. In these circumstances, the author of the proposal merely asked that his observations should be mentioned in the report.Article 15, paragraph 10.One member of the committee proposed to amend the provisions of paragraph 10. According to the text as it now stands, &quot;a report made by the Assembly, if concurred in by the representa-tives of those members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other members of the League, exclusive in each case of the representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties the dispute.&quot; The author of the proposal asked i.Lat the representatives of liose members of the League represented on the Council should no longer be added to the majority of the League members. He thought that, if the Council were unable to obtain the unanimous adoption of its report, it ought to be able to bring the dispute before the Assembly and to rely purely and simply upon the majority of the members of the League of Nations. He thought in this way to extend the scope of this procedure, which in practice has been little used.The committee did not share this view. If we examine para-graph 10 of article 15, we find no contradiction between that text and the Pact of Paris. Strictly speaking, therefore, it was not part of the committee&apos;s duty to examine an amendment, however desirable in itself, which was not imposed by the desire to harmonise the two pacts.The amendment submitted to the Council would have intro-reproduced an entirely new procedure into the system of the League Covenant. The author of the amendment naturally pointed out that, now that war was banished from the Covenant of the League
M. Nations, it was desirable to multiply the forms of pacific procedure. The committee, however, thought that the proposal was too remotely connected with its mission to be considered.Article 16.1. One member of the committee reverted to a reservation which he had made, during the discussion of article 12, concerning the effects of the amendment adopted by the committee upon the opera-tion of the sanctions provided for in article 16.In particular, he called the attention of the committee to the case of war occurring after a breakdown of the various forms of pro-cedure provided by article 15, paragraph 7. He would have wished that in such case sanctions should only apply in regard to the period of three months provided for in article 12. When this period had elapsed, the possibility of sanctions in case of resort to war would disappear.The proposal was, in reality, not so much one for amending article 16 as for framing article 12 in a different way, which would make it possible to avoid-an extension of sanctions. The member completed his proposal by asking for the insertion of articles 1 and 2 of the Pact of Paris in the Preamble to the Covenant.In support of the proposal, the author insisted upon the circum-stances in which the Council would adopt its report if unanimity could not be secured for the recommendations of the report. In such a case there was the risk of seeing the members of the Council divided into two groups of almost equal strength and importance but differing in opinion upon the respective claims of the parties. The authority of a report voted in such conditions was weakened and it might be difficult to bring the sanctions of article 16 into operation against the State which did not comply with the report.2. The committee did not feel it should give effect to thispro-posal. Eesort to war is forbidden in every case. This constitutes for the members of the League a definite obligation the execution of which must be ensured. The Covenant of the League of Nations being an organic legal whole, ..it .is ipapossible to conceive of there being two kinds of obligations of which one kind only would be accompanied by sanctions. The new undertakings contracted by the members of the League under articles 12, 13 and 15 would be meaningless if they could remain a dead letter. This being so, it is essential to place them on the same footing as the obligations previously established by those articles and covered by the authority of article 16.In practice, moreover, the amendments to articles 12, 13 and 15 will not add to the burden of the obligations contracted by States under article 16. These amendments aim at ensuring the pacific settlement of disputes more effectively and with greater certainty. To that extent they reduce the chances of war and therefore the possibility of sanctions. As was pointed out, the stronger the system of sanctions, the less the risk of having to apply them.
One member of the committee reverted to a proposal made by a Government to insert a new paragraph between paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 17. This new paragraph would have provided that, &quot; if a State which is not a member of the League resorts to war against a member of the League before it has been invited to accept the said obligations, article 16 shall be applicable to such State so long as it does not comply with the measures taken by the Council for the re-establishment of peace.&quot;It was urged in support of this proposal that the Council ought to be given powers against a State which commits an act of aggres-sion so sudden that it would be impossible for the Council to extend to it the invitation contained in article 17, paragraph 1. (&quot; In the event of a dispute between a member of the League and a State which is not a member of the League, or between States not members of the League, the State or States not members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council.&quot;)The committee considered that this modification was not called for by the Pact of Paris. It is not for the League of Nations to ensure in all circumstances respect for the pact renouncing war. It might be thought in some quarters that the League of Nations was exceeding its powers if, by modifying its Covenant, it reserved the right to put into effect the sanctions provided for under article 16 in the case of any war whatever, even if it had not invited the belligerents to appear before it.Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Council of the League of Nations would not have the time to invite States not members of the League to lay their disputes before it. For it to be other-wise, an abrupt and definite aggression would have to have been committed, and the Council would then be authorised to act in virtue of article 10 or of article 11.One member of the committee proposed that the attention of the Assembly be called to the very serious obligations that article 17 might involve, owing to the fact that certain large States are not members of the League of Nations.Article 18.One member of the committee proposed that the registration of treaties should be made subject to certain fundamental condi-tions. He asked that the secretariat of the League of Nations should not be authorised to register any treaty of peace imposed by force as a consequence of a war commenced in violation of the
Pact of Paris. He added that the League of Nations should lend its assistance in order to re-establish the status quo destroyed by such a war.The effect of such a provision would be to render invalid treaties concluded under the influence of force.The committee fully recognised the importance of this suggestion, but for the following reasons it did not think that the proposed amendment should be entertained.In the first place, there is nothing in article 18 that is incom-patible with the Pact of Paris. It is, therefore, not a priori necessary to modify it.Secondly, the object of article 18 is not to confer an enhanced value upon certain treaties, but simply to ensure publicity for treaties. The effect of the amendment submitted to the committee would, therefore, be a complete modification of the meaning of article 18.Moreover, the contingency of a treaty imposed by force is difficult to conceive. The stipulations of articles 12, 18 and 15 are such, henceforth, that all disputes must be settled in accordance with the law. To hold otherwise would be to admit the possibility of the. Pact of Paris and the Covenant of the League of Nations being violated with impunity in their essential provisions. It would be tantamount to forgetting that article 16 establishes solidarity between all the members of the League of Nations and imposes upon them the obligation to oppose any such violation.Finally, the application of the proposed amendment would have met with immense difficulties. It would be hard to imagine^ the secretariat refusing to register a treaty on the ground that it: was dictated by force. Such a discrimination between treaties would involve political action in the first instance, and that of the most delicate description. The Council would have to be applied to. But it would be imposing upon the Council a singularly heavy task to ask it to exercise a general control over all treaties that might be concluded.In these circumstances, the committee does not propose any amendment to article 18. It recognises, however, that the idea underlying the proposed amendment is an interesting one which might be considered by the League of Nations at a later date.

No. 5. 1Viscount Cecil to Mr. A. Henderson.Sir, Geneua, October 5, 1930.- Tile First Committee began, on the 22nd September, its examination of the report of the Committee of Eleven* on the amendments to the Covenant in order to bring the Covenant into harmony with the Pact of Paris. The general discussion continued throughout four sittings of the committee, nearly every delegation taking part in the discussion, and some of the delegates speaking more than once.2. The Japanese delegate, M. Ito, raised the question of principle whether it was desirable to amend the Covenant at all. He argued that the Pact of Paris had not, in fact, prohibited all war, but merely wars of aggression, and since it had provided no tribunal for determining what was a war of aggression, this point was left purely to the subjective appreciation of the State concerned. In the circumstances the principles of the Pact of Paris did not seem to him suitable for incorporation in the Covenant of the League.3. The Chairman drew M. Ito&apos;s attention to the resolution of the Assembly of the 24th September, 1929, which pronounced on the desirability of amending the Covenant, and I pointed out that M. Ito had been one of the signatories of the report of the Committee of Eleven. I, therefore, assumed that his present remarks were to be construed as tentative expressions of doubt rather than as confirmed objections. As a result M. Ito did not persist in his objections.4. The following States expressed full approval of the proposed amendments : Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Holland, Finland (subject to an amendment which will be mentioned in a later paragraph), Estonia, Australia, China, Chile.The delegates of Portugal, Austria and Albania expressed doubt as to the effect of certain of the proposed amendments, which, however, as a whole they seemed disposed to accept. The delegate of South Africa stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union would be prepared to sign and ratify the amendments in the interest of unanimity, subject, of course, to the understanding that they would only come into force upon the general acceptance of a disarmament convention. The New Zealand delegate stated that he had not yet received final instructions from his Government. The Roumanian delegate declared that the question had become political rather than legal, and suggested that further consideration of the problem should be deferred until next year.. ...... * See p. 19.------------------------------- -   - -
5. The Swedish delegate, M. Unden, while not contesting the desirability of bringing the Covenant into harmony with the Pact of Paris, was the ablest and most persistent critic of. the proposed amendments. He developed, with considerable force, the familiar argument that the amendments provided for an extension of the sanctions of article 16 of the Covenant. I replied to . the effect that there was no real extension of the sanctions; that the suggestion that the League might in the future have to deal with several different kinds of war, some of which might violate the Covenant of the League, and others only the Pact of Paris, was a purely hypothetical and improbable conception; and that the effect of the amendments now proposed would help to render the outbreak of war more unlikely and thereby reduce the possibility of any application of the sanctions being necessary. M. Unden, who spoke two or three times in the course of the debate, expressed himself as unconvinced by these arguments, and. put forward the ingenious proposal that the substance of the Pact of Paris should be incorporated not, as proposed by the committee, in article 15 of the Covenant, but in article 10, the provisions of the latter article being, in his opinion, not subject to the sanctions of article 16. I expressed doubts whether article 10 could really be considered as exempt from the application of the sanctions of article 16, and the Belgian delegate remarked that under article 10 the members of the League undertook not merely to &quot; respect,&quot; but to &quot;maintain,&quot; the territorial integrity of other members. No other delegate spoke in favour of M. Unden&apos;s specific proposals, though a few, and in particular the Norwegian delegate (M. Baestad), had expressed, in the course of the debate, general sympathy with his difficulties.6. The Pinnish delegate detected an inconsistency in the proposed new form of article 12, since the first paragraph binds members of the League only to employ pacific means and the second paragraph binds them not to resort to war. M. Erich wished for the addition of a new clause specifically binding members to refrain from all measures of coercion which might fall short of war, in the following terms : &quot; They also agree to refrain from any measure of coercion which would be contrary to the principle laid down in article 10 of the present Covenant.&quot;7. At the end of the general debate it was decided to appoint a sub-committee, composed of representatives of those delegations which had taken the most prominent part in the debate, to examine the proposed amendments in detail and, taking into account the political as well as the juridical aspects of the question, endeavour to discover a way of reconciling the diverse views which had been expressed.I have, &amp;c.CECIL.[22169]
No. 6. tReport of the First Committee of the Eleventh Assembly on the Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations with a view to bringing it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. October 8, 1980.The First Committee, after considering the report drawn up by the sub-committee which it had appointed, has approved this report and unanimously decided to submit to the Assembly the draft resolution proposed by the sub-committee.Report of the Sub-Committee.The Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations adopted, on the 24th September, 1929, the following resolution : &quot;The Assembly:Taking note of the resolution submitted to it on tho 6th September on behalf of various delegations to the effect that, in view of the large measure of acceptance obtained by the Pact signed at Paris on the 27th August, 1928, whereby the parties-renounced war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another, it is desirable that articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations should be re-examined in order to determine whether it is necessary to make any modifications therein;&apos;&apos; Taking note aiso of the resolution proposed by the Peruvian delegation on the 10th September recommending that a report should be obtained as to the alterations which were necessary in the Covenant of the League in order to give effect to the prohibitions contained in the Pact of Paris :&apos;&apos; Declares that it is desirable that the terms of the Covenant of the League should not accord any longer to members of the League a right to have recourse to war in cases in which that right has been renounced by the provisions of the Pact of Paris referred to above&apos;;&apos;&apos; Instructs the Secretary-General to communicate to all the members of the League a copy of the amendments to the Covenant of the League which have been proposed for this purpose by the British Government, together with such further papers as may be necessary;&apos;&apos; Invites the Council to appoint a committee of eleven persons to frame a report as to the amendments in the Covenant of the League which are necessary to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. This committee should meet in the first three months of 1980, and in the course of its work should take into account any replies or observations which have been received from the members of the League by that date. The report of the committee will be submitted to the members of the League in order that such action as may be deemed appropriate may be taken during the meeting of the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly in 1930.&quot;
A committee of eleven jurists, appointed by the Council at its session in January 1980, in execution of this resolution, met at Geneva from the 25th February to the 5th March, 1980, with M. Scialoja in the chair.On the 8th March, 1980, it submitted a report* containing most carefully framed proposals for amendments.This report and its proposals were referred to the First Committee with a view to the examination of that important item of its agenda the question of amendments to the Covenant.After a very thorough general discussion, the First Committee, on the proposal of M. Eolin and M. Politis, appointed a sub-committee to consider the political as well as the juridical aspects of the problem of bringing the League Covenant into harmony with the Paris Pact. The sub-committee was also instructed to consider what changes, if any, should be made in the proposals of the Committee of Jurists, and to state in its report whether it considered the question to be ripe for decision this year.The sub-committee,t with M. J. Limburg (Netherlands) in the chair, held seven meetings.I.   *The study of the amendments to the Covenant proposed by the Committee of Jurists or, during the Assembly, by the various delegations led the sub-committee to draw up, as a compromise and provisionally, the following proposals : -Preamble.In conformity with the proposals of the Committee of Eleven, instead of:&quot; In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war,&quot; the sub-committee proposes :&apos;&apos; In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by accepting the obligation not to resort to war.&quot;Article 12, -paragraphs 1 and 2. The sub-committee adopted the following wording : -        - t&quot; 1. The members of the League agree that, if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, they* See p. 19.t The svib-eommittee consisted of the following: 61. Cassin (France), Viscount Cecil of Chelwood (Great Britain), M. Chao-Cliu Wu (China), M. Krich (Finland), M. Gaus (Germany), M. Guani (Uruguay), M. Ito (Japan), M. Limburg (Netherlands), M. Mironesco (Roumania) (replaced by M. Visoiano), M. Pilotti (Italy), M. Politis (Greece), M. Eaestad (Norway), M. Kolin (Belgium), M. Unden (Sweden)M. Hoftinger (Austria) and M. Bundstein (Poland) were present at the meetings in order to explain the proposals submitted to the sub-committee by their respective delegations.
will in no case have recourse to war for the settlement of the dis- * pute, and will only employ pacific means for this purpose. If the dispute cannot be otherwise settled, it shall be submitted either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council. &quot;2. The award of the arbitrators or the judicial decision shall . be given and the report of the Council shall be made within a reasonable period.&quot;I. The text which embodies the condemnation of resort to war in the case of a dispute likely to lead to a rupture does not differ in substance from that adopted by the Committee of Jurists. The juridical commentary submitted in this connection by the Committee of Jurists is accordingly not affected.If. Nevertheless, the order and arrangement of the provisions of the new article 12 are different from those adopted in the text proposed by the Committee of Eleven.Instead of commencing with the undertaking to employ only pacific means for the settlement of a dispute likely to lead to a rupture and then enumerating the various forms of pacific procedure which could be chosen if the &quot;disagreement &quot; continued, and stating only at the end of the first paragraph the undertaking in no case to resort to war, the new article 12 begins by excluding resort to war if a dispute likely to lead to a rupture arises between members of the League, and lays down as a correlative that only peaceful means shall be employed for the settlement of such disputes. The enumeration of the various forms of pacific procedure between which the nations concerned may choose if the &apos; disagreement&apos;&apos; continues has, therefore, been relegated to the third sentence of the article.This new text is clearer and more logical.III. The sub-committee, like the Committee of Eleven, considered that there was no reason to omit paragraph 2 of article 12, the utility of which continues, and is even increased with the extension of forms of pacific procedure and the importance of their success from the standpoint of world peace.Nevertheless, a unification has been accomplished: all tribunals, including the Council, are bound to reach a decision or make a report within a reasonable time.Article 13, varagravli 4. The sub-committee adopted the following text: &apos;&apos; The members of the League agree that they will carry Out in full good faith the award or decision rendered in a dispute to which they have been parties. They further under -take in no way to support a State in refusal to carry out an award or decision. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award or decision, the Council shall propose what measures of all kinds should be taken to give effect thereto; the votes of the representatives of the parties shall not be counted.&quot;I. In the new draft proposed by it for the beginning of article 13, paragraph 4, the Committee of Eleven, had retained the
undertaking by the members of the League to earry out in full good faith the award or decision rendered, but had substituted in the same sentence, in the place of the original undertaking now useless &quot;not (to) resort to war against a member of the League which complies therewith,&quot; the undertaking &quot;not to take any action against any member of the League which complies there-with.&quot;The sub-committee considered it desirable not to merge in a single provision, but to enunciate in two consecutive sentences of the same paragraph, the positive obligations which rest upon the parties to the dispute, and the general obligation (negative in character) of full good faith which, on pronouncement of the award or decision, become incumbent upon all the other members of the League. The provision which, in the first draft, had in view the relations of these members with a State which complies with the award or decision has been reversed; it now deals with the attitude of these members in regard to a refractory State, the refusal of which to carry out the award or decision they agree not to encourage.II. The sub-committee unanimously recognised what the report of the Committee of Eleven had already emphasised the cardinal importance of ensuring that the award or decision rendered should, whatever the circumstances, be carried out. Any failure of the League in this field would have incalculable consequences and must be guarded against.The committee did not feel that it should go beyond the proposals of the Committee of Eleven in regard to the exclusion of the votes of the parties and to the question as to the manner in which the Council should take its decision unanimously or by a simple majority, in accordance with article 5 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.III. The text of article 18, paragraph 4, proposed by the Committee of Jurists in order to define the part to be played by the Council was adopted in its entirety by the sub-committee.The sub-committee unanimously recognised that a &apos;&apos; constitu-tional duty &quot; devolved upon the Council to ensure execution, when requested to do so by the State which, having had an award or decision pronounced in its favour, was faced by a persistent refusal on the part of the other party to carry out that award or decision. It was agreed that the French phrase &quot; Le Conseil propose &quot; and the English &quot;It shall propose,&quot; are imperative and constitute a recognition of the Council&apos;s responsibilities in such a case.IV. It is within the power of the Council to resort, if necessary, to third States, in order to apply to a refractory State measures likely to secure compliance with the award or decision, and it is for the Council to indicate such measures, as also the time at which they are to be applied.Proposals made by the Council to States which have not yet become parties to the dispute are different in character from injunctions to a State which refuses to comply with the award or decision, the latter being imperatively and absomtely bound by
such an award. Members of the League which have not yet becomef: parties to the dispute are entitled, for their part, in virtue of the general principles of article 5, to send a representative to the Council should the question of their possible participation in the measures contemplated by it arise. At the same time, if presented with a recommendation by the Council, it is their moral duty to comply with it.V. As noted in the Jurists&apos; report, the proposed text obviously guarantees the right of States to proceed by themselves to execution of an award or decision rendered in their favour.The only question remaining open is that of the limits within which the State in whose favour the award or decision has been rendered must restrict itself. It appears in accordance with the general desire to accept the view that the principle of prohibition of resort to war laid down in the Preamble applies to the case. The lack of sufficient certainty on this altogether new point of inter-national law should be an additional inducement for the successful State to resort to the Council, and for the Council to propose measures for the execution of the award or decision.Article 15, paragraph 6.&quot; If the report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Council shall invite the parties to comply with the recommendations of the report. The members of the League undertake in no way to support any party in refusal to comply with such recommendations.&quot;I. The amendment to article 15, paragraph 6, of the Covenant proposed by the Committee of Eleven aimed principally at giving the Council&apos;s unanimous resolutions a binding character, comparable to, if not identical with, that of arbitral awards or judicial decisions. The sub-committee endeavoured to discover whether, under present circumstances, it could propose to the Assembly this important modification of the system established by the Covenant.Doubts were expressed on this point in several quarters. It was pointed out that the Council was a political organ, and, as such, should retain an elasticity and a freedom of decision which might be impeded and hampered if its recommendations were recognised as binding. The very nature of its task would thus, it was said, be changed, for it would act no longer as mediator but as an arbitrator, and sometimes this might even make it more difficult to secure unanimous agreement.In these circumstances, the sub-committee returned to the original principles established by the Covenant.II. The existing text of article 15, paragraph 6, of the Covenant has only been modified in so far as was rendered inevitable by the need to substitute for the restrictions it contained with regard to the possibility of legal war a text in accordance with the principles of the Paris Pact.
^ The amendments made consist, first of all, in the provision that &quot; the Council shall invite the parties to comply with the recom-mendations of the report.&quot; The word &quot;invite,&quot; which does not appear in the present text of paragraph 6, is only a slight strengthening of the force of the conclusions of a unanimous report; it emphasises what already existed in virtue of paragraph 4.Secondly, the members of the League undertake &quot;in no way to support any party in refusal to comply with such recommenda-tions.&quot; This obligation upon third States has been substituted for the present obligation not to go to war with the State which complies with the recommendations, for the reasons explained in connexion with article 13.III. Both from the point of view of the Council and from that of the States which are parties to a dispute, the proposals to which the sub-committee has felt it should restrict itself differ from the conclusions of the Committee of Eleven, in that it is not longer possible to assimilate the effects of the recommendations of a unanimous report by the Council to those of an arbitral award or judicial decision.The analogy which remains is the undertaking in both cases on the part of third States members of the League in no way to support any party in refusal to comply with the Council&apos;s recom-mendations: this undertaking would naturally be confined to cases in which the other State had failed to comply with its obligations under article 12.Article 15, paragraph 7.&quot; If the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, it shall examine the procedure best suited to meet the case and recommend it to the parties.&quot;The sub-committee maintained without any modification the text of the amendment to article 15, paragraph 7, proposed by the Committee of Eleven.Article 15, paragraph This. The text proposed by the Committee of Eleven was as follows : &quot; At any stage of the examination, the Council may, either at the request of one of the parties or on its own initiative, ask the Permanent Court of International Justice for an advisory opinion on points of law relating to the dispute. Such application shall not require a unanimous vote by the Council.&quot;As the obligatory character of the Council&apos;s unanimous recommendations has not been retained, it was thought that the principal reason which existed for the insertion of this supple-mentary provision in the Covenant, and which would have justified its maintenance, no longer remained.
Article 16, paragraph 1, first sentence. V ,The  sub-committee  confined itself  to  putting forward  the following draft: &quot; Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under article 12, it shall, ipso facto, be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League . . . .&quot;The change made is merely suppression of the reference to articles 13 and 15 which in the Covenant followed the reference to article 12. This reference was justified by the fact that those two articles contained partial prohibitions of resort to war, whereas, with the new draft, article 12 contains a general prohibition of resort to war.The proposal to alter article 16 still further, with the object of limiting the application of sanctions, was not adopted.H.After completing the first part of its task, which was to examine what changes it might be desirable to make in the proposals of the Committee of Eleven, having regard to the political and the legal aspects of the problem of bringing the Covenant of the League of Nations into concordance with the Pact of Paris, the sub-committee had still, under its terms of reference, to pronounce upon whether the question seemed to it to be ripe for final decision this year.On this point, the sub-committee obtained, in the first place, the opinion of the representatives of those members of the League of Nations which have not acceded to the Pact of Paris and accordingly do not stand in the same relation to the problem as the other members of the League.The task of perfecting the Covenant of the League which has been undertaken receives the full sympathy of these members of the League as being in harmony with their political traditions, but does not present itself to them as an urgent matter. They feel that its achievement should be conditional upon a very thorough examination of the new methods of pacific settlement which are its corollary.In this connexion, mention was made of the possibility that, in the work done by the League in the matter, all reference to the Pact of Paris should be omitted. This, however, would raise another problem.Certain of the States which have signed or acceded to the Pact of Paris accompanied their signatures or accessions by interpretations of the terms employed in that instrument.The question might, in particular, be asked whether these inter-interpretations would have the same effect if the case ceased to be one of bringing the Covenant into harmony with the Pact of Paris and became merely one of introducing the principle of prohibition of resort to war into the Covenant of the League of Nations.The proposed amendments have given rise to other questions as to the problem of the compatibility of the amended Covenant of the
* See p. 19.eague of Nations with other treaties and situations which were the object of express reservations when the Pact of Paris was concluded. The sub-committee felt that it would be impossible to settle these questions unless the Governments concerned were given the oppor-tunity to examine them further.This consideration was one of those which played the greatest part in causing a considerable majority of the sub-committee to feel that it would be actually in the interests of the success of the proposed amendments that they should be referred to the Governments for further examination. It was, however, not the only consideration. The question of the conditions of the application of the sanctions of article 16 of the Covenant to the new obligations is a question on which all the members of the League do not as yet hold the same views. The discussions in the full Committee and in the sub-committee are a proof of this.Moreover, the sub-committee had considered substantial changes in the amendments proposed by the Committee of Eleven. In a matter of such importance, it is entirely appropriate that the Governments of the members of the League should be able to examine the new texts.Accordingly, the sub-committee proposes that the following draft resolution be submitted to the Assembly : - .   -Draft Resolution.&quot; The Assembly:&apos;&apos; Believing it to be necessary to incorporate in the Covenant of the League of Nations the general prohibition of resort to war and the principle that the settlement of international disputes should never be sought except by pacific means;&apos;&apos; Appreciating the great value of the report made by the Committee of Eleven ;*&quot; Taking account of the facts that, on some points, the First Committee has been led to consider changes in the proposed texts and that in the course of the discussion certain political aspects of the question have come into view which render it desirable for it to be further studied;&apos;&apos; Bequests the Secretary-General to submit to the Govern-ments of the members of the League the report of the Committee of Eleven and that of the First Committee, asking them to formulate their observations before the 1st June, 1981, and to state, if they so desire, what amendments to the Covenant would, in their opinion, be best suited to attain the object in view.&quot;

Section 40.[W 11499/208/98] No. 1.Viscount Cecil to the Marquess of Reading. (Received October 6.)United Kingdom Delegation to the (No. 110.) League of. Nations, Geneva,My Lord, * September 30, 1931.I HAVE the honour to report that the First Committee discussed the, proposed amendments to the Covenant to bring it into harmony with the Pact of Paris. The matter had been adjourned from the last Assembly in order to give members of the League the opportunity of expressing their opinion on the texts prepared by the Committee of Eleven and by the Sub-Committee of the First Committee at the last Assembly.2. In the course of the discussions in the First Committee the delegations of certain countries, whose Governments had not stated their views in writing on the texts prepared by the Committee of Eleven and by the Sub-Committee of the First Committee in 1930, were in a position to explain them orally to the committee. The delegations of Austria and Canada in this way announced the concurrence of their Governments in the texts prepared by the sub-committee of 1930, and the Spanish delegate the warm approval of his Government of the proposal to insert in the Covenant the general prohibition of war of the Paris Pact,3. During the discussion of the question whether a definite decision in this matter should be taken during the present Assembly, Mr. Beckett explained that, whereas the late Government of the United Kingdom had expressed its agreement in the texts prepared by the sub-committee in 1930, His Majesty&apos;s present Government had not, owing to the exigencies of the situation, been able to form any opinion on the matter, and that, therefore, the delegation of the United Kingdom were in favour of a final decision on this question being postponed, though they raised no objection to the consideration of points of detail in the endeavour to eliminate misunderstandings or differences of opinion. (It was, indeed, clear that the majority of the committee were unwilling to postpone all discussion of this matter even if they could be persuaded to defer final decisions.) Mr. Beckett also stated that my personal view on the question remained unchanged.4. Until the time when he made this statement, the opinions expressed on the question of adjournment had been fairly equally divided. After his state-ment, however, it was clear that no delegation was in favour of any attempt to take a definite decision during the present Assembly, and the question then became merely one as to what, if any. action should be taken in the matter at the present time. No delegation stated openly any desire that the whole question should be dropped, though Mr. te, Water (Union of South Africa) expressed the view that it would be better to drop it if agreement could not be reached soon, and the representative of Japan explained that his Government had never been very favourable to the scheme and had only accepted it in a spirit of conciliation and on condition that it received almost unanimous acceptance. The inference which he intended should be drawn from his words was clear, namely, that, if the United Kingdom should not be in favour of continuing with the proposal, the Japanese Government would also take the same view.5. In the end it was decided that the matter should be referred to a sub-committee in order that it should prepare a report on the question. The sub-committee, which was not given any clearly-defined terms of reference by the committee, interpreted its task as being, first of all, to present a clear statement of the opinions held by the delegations on the different texts, to consider the further amendments proposed by Governments since the last Assembly, and to bring about, so far as possible, a reconciliation of such differences of opinion as were found to exist. The most important of the new amendments proposed is [277 f-10]
that suggested by the Italian Government in its letter of the 16th April to insert after the first paragraph of article 16 of the Covenant the following proviso :  &quot; Provided always that in the case dealt with in article 15, paragraph 7, the members of the League may make their action subject to the condition that the Council is unanimous either in proposing provisional measures intended to re-establish peace or in declaring which is the Covenant-breaking State.&quot;The sub-committee held several meetings and submitted to the committee a report drafted by M. Rolin, reviewing the whole position. It did not endorse any of the further amendments to the Covenant which had been proposed since the Assembly of 1930, though it recommended that one or twtxof them (not, however, including the Italian amendment referred to above) should be retained for further consideration. There is still, however, a, strong movement to go back to the text of the Committee of Eleven for paragraph 6 of article 15, which gives binding force to a unanimous decision of the Council, although the report recognises that there is no sign that this proposal would receive &quot; the necessary ratifications.&quot; It would not appear likely that any Government would refuse to accept the amendments merely on the ground that this proposal was not adopted.6. During the course of the discussions in the First Committee frequent references were made to the connexion between the amendments to the Covenant and the future Disarmament Conference. In particular, M. Cassin (France), rather indirectly, M. Politis (Greece) and M. Rolin (Belgium), expressly, advanced the view that, whereas His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had stated that they would make their ratification of the amendments to the Covenant dependent on the adoption of a General Disarmament Convention, and thereby, as the speakers argued, indicated the view that the amendments created further obligations which His Majesty&apos;s Government would only be prepared to undertake if the risks attending them were lessened by the existence of a disarmament convention, other Governments took the view that the amendments, if adopted, would increase their security, and they consequently desired to know what the position was going to be as regards their adoption before they bound themselves by a disarmament convention.7. This view resulted in the proposal, which is contained in the resolution proposed by the sub-committee and adopted by the First Committee and by the Assembly, that a special committee of representatives of all members of the League should be convened to meet while the Disarmament Conference was in progress in order to arrive at a unanimous agreement on the amendments to the Covenant.. The resolution leaves unsettled the exact date of the convocation of the committee to the Council, and provides that in the interval Governments may send in their views to the Council as to the lines on which they consider agreement on the question of the amendment of the Covenant could best be attained. I did not consider that my instructions required me to oppose this proposal, in view of the fact that an adjournment of the taking of any final decision at the present Assembly had been secured, an adjournment sufficient to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to come to a decision as regards their attitude to this matter. Indeed, in view of the fact that it was His Majesty:s Government who had been the first to connect the amendments to the Covenant with a future disarmament convention, it would have been extremely difficult for me to have opposed the proposal.8. The resolution adopted by the Assembly on this question does not formally approve M. Rolin&apos;s report, but merely takes note of its approval by the First Committee, a formula which was adopted expressly in order to make it clear that the resolution of the Assembly in no way committed Governments to approval of the views expressed in the report. Apart from these points, the resolution of the Assembly merely reaffirms the intention of continuing the task of inserting in the Covenant of the League of Nations a general prohibition of recourse to war, and the principle that the settlement of international disputes may only be sought by pacific methods, or, in other words, merely reaffirms the resolutions on this subject which had been adopted in 1929 and 1930.I have, &amp;c.CECIL.
[Distributed to the Members of the League, the Assembly and the Council.1Official No. : A. 86. 1931. V.Geneva, September 24th, 1931.LEAGUE OF NATIONSAMENDMENT OF THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS IN ORDER TO BRING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE PACT OF PARISREPORT OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE TO THE ASSEMBLYRapporteur : M. Henri Rolin (Belgium).1. Both the written observations submitted by various Governments since the last session of the Assembly and the recent discussions in the First Committee seem to show that most of the Members of the League of Nations attach the highest importance to the continuance of the task that has been undertaken.The importance and the legal effect of the Pact of Paris are not, of course, in question ; but the prevailing opinion is that it would be undesirable to maintain in the text of the League Covenant possibilities of a lawful recourse to war which have been virtually abolished and to fail to adapt the operation of the organisation set up by them to safeguard peace to the new engagements assumed by the Members of the League of Nations.Even those Governments which had expressed the vieAV that the work of adjustment decided upon by the Assembly in 1929 was not indispensable have in a spirit of conciliation declared that they accept in principle the idea underlying that work.2. During the previous discussions, the fear had been occasionally expressed that certain difficulties might result from the fact that some Members of the League had not acceded to the Pact of Paris and that some States signatory of that treaty Avere not Members of the League of Nations. At the present time, it would seem that the League need have no further apprehensions on either point. On the one hand, some Members of the League which had not acceded to the Pact of Paris have either sent or announced their accession since last year ; in any case, no objection is made against the continuation of the work of amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations. As regards States signatory of the Pact of Paris which are not Members of the League, obviously no decision can be taken in their absence as to the scope they should give to their obligations ; but the task undertaken by the League has the same end in view as the Pact of Paris and reinforces the authority of the principle formulated therein.It should, however, be emphasised that the task undertaken by the League of Nations in the matter is legally independent of the Pact of Paris, although influenced by that instrument ; its object is to insert the principle of the prohibition of war in the Covenant of the League of Nations.3. The First Committee successively re-examined the three fundamental aspects of the proposed amendment :(1) Prohibition of recourse, to war ;(2) Organisation of pacific methods of settling disputes ;(3) Extension of the Councils mission of maintaining and restoring peace.Prohibition op Recourse to War.4. No objection in principle is now made against the idea of formulating in a single article of the Covenant   namely, Article 12   and in the simplest terms, the prohibition of recourse to war.S. d. N. 2.275 (F) 1,650 (A) 9/31.  Imp. do la T. do G.
The prevailing opinion is that the insertion of this prohibition does not require the insertion of any further elaboration or reservations in the text of the Covenant, since the questions raised on this point in the course of the discussion arise and are equally material under the existing text of the Covenant, so that its amendment does not make it more necessary to solve them explicitly.It would seem, moreover, that, even now, an answer can be given to most of the questions which will be satisfactory and acceptable to all the Members of the League.5. One point appears beyond dispute   namely, that neither in the amendment prepared by the Sub-Committee last year, nor in the amendment of the Committee of Eleven, nor in the Pact of Paris, nor in the Covenant of the League in its present form, does the prohibition of recourse to war exclude the right of self-defence.As has been already pointed out by the Italian GoArernment in its letter of April 16th, 1931 :&quot; . . It is not in the least necessary to include in the amendments a clause relating to self-defence, since it is obvious that a State which had disregarded the clause forbidding war could not demand that a State attacked by it should observe that clause&quot;.6. On the other hand, in the present state of the law, the satisfactory enumeration of the distinctive characteristics either of aggression or of legitimate self-defence appears difficult and even impossible.After examining a cognate question, the Third Committee felt it desirable to refer on this point to certain explanations contained in M. de Brouckere&apos;s report submitted in 1926 to the Council.1 The First Committee refers to the same statement as showing how difficult to define exactly in adA^ance and how full of fine shades of meaning the notion of legitimate self-defence is.7. An essential point to note is that the use wdiich a State claims to make of the right of self-defence is a matter which may be considered by the other States concerned and, in the case of Members of the League of Nations, is subject to the appreciation of the Council, particularly when there may be a question of applying Article 16.8. Obviously, in judging the facts which are placed before it, the Council will have to be guided, not only by the general principles of law, but also by any special engagements for preventing war which have previously been undertaken by the parties to the dispute and been recognised as conducing to the maintenance of peace. Thus, the Members of tho League of Nations have frequently and unanimously recognised as conducing to the maintenance of peace, under Article 21 of the CoA^lieutenant, agreements such as the Rhineland Pact; the general adoption of such agreements Avas recommended by the Assembly&apos;s resolution of September 25th, 1926 ; and, further, on the initiative of Germany, a convention has just been draAvn up the object of Avhich is to facilitate action by the Council to prevent war.9. These considerations and the interpretation of the obligations prescribed in Articles 10, 11 and 16 of the Covenant lead to the conclusion that assistance given spontaneously by a Member of the League to another Member, Avhich has been the victim of a flagrant aggression, Avould not constitute a violation of the prohibition of recourse to Avar. Inteiwentions of this kind would, hoAveA^er, in their turn be subject to the appreciation of their character by other Members of the League and by the Council, and to the opinion of the latter the State which had intervened would be obliged to conform.10. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the proposed amendment of the Covenant, whether it is adopted in the form suggested by the Committee of EleAren or in that clraAvn up by the Sub-Committee, Avould deprive the Members of the League of the right to resort to Avar in execution of an arbitral aAArard or a unanimous decision of the Council. Such action is obviously quite distinct from the conception of the right of self-defence. It is for the Council to assure the execution of arbitral aAvards. If it prescribed military measures, the latter Avould lose their character of recourse to Avar and Avould assume a character of social defence in perfect harmony AAdth the principles adopted. This constitutional duty of the Council is, no doubt, particularly imperative under the CoArenant as amended, since it is the counterpart to the relinquishment of the indiAddual right of execution.1 See Document A.14.1927.V, page 69.   M. de Brouckere said:&quot; Every act of violence does not necessarily justify its victim in resorting to war. If a detachment of soldiers goes a few yards over the frontier in a colony remote from any vital contre ; if the circumstances show quite clearly that the aggression was due to an error on the part of some subaltern officer ; if the central authorities of the &apos;aggressor State&apos; reprimand the subordinate concerned as soon as tlie^&apos; are apprised of the facts ; if they cause the invasion to cease, offer apologies and compensation and take steps to prevent any recurrence of such incidents   then it cannot bo maintained that there lias been an act of war and that the invaded country has reasonable grounds for mobilising its army and marcliing upon tho enemy capital. The accidont Avhich has occurred has in no way released that country from the specific obligations laid down in Articles 12 and following. It could not be so released unless it Avere the victim of a flagrant aggression of such a serious character that it Avould obviously bo dangerous not to retaliate at once. In short, to borrow the felicitous phrase used in the Treaty of Locarno, &apos;the country in question rmist bo exercising the right of legitimate defence&apos;.&quot; Legitimate defence implies the adoption of measures proportionate to tho seriousness of tho attack and justified by the imminence of tho danger. If a country flagrantly exceeded those limits, even if it wore, affronted by somo incident of little intrinsic importance, it would become in actual fact the real aggressor and it would bo only fair that that country should be made tho object of the sanctions provided for in Article 10&quot;.
11. The Committee noted the desire of the Chinese Government to meet the dangers resulting from a country creating what is, in fact, a state of war, while not officially recognising that a Avar exists. The Committee did not feel it should for the moment enter upon a discussion of this question.12. The Finnish Government proposed an amendment the object of which Avas to keep the first sentence of Article 12 in the form in which it is in the present text of the Covenant, on the ground that the provisions of the CoA^lieutenant should not be changed except so far as is absolutely necessary. Although, however, the Finnish proposal indicates in the second sentence that pacific measures are in general lawful, the Committee felt that the text proposed might be open to the interpretation that acts of retorsion or pacific reprisals which have no aggressive character were prevented and this is a question Avith Avhich the Committee is not on the present occasion concerned.The GoA^ernments of the Irish Free State and Estonia proposed an amendment suppressing the words &quot; likely to lead to a rupture &quot; which follow the Avord &quot; dispute &quot; in Articles 12 and 15 of the CoA&apos;lieutenant. This amendment Avas felt to raise a question which Avas independent of the problem of amending the CoA^lieutenant so as to insert in it a prohibition of recourse to Avar.The GoArernments of Finland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and NeAv Zealand proposed various changes in the text of the contemplated amendment to Article 12.The First Committee notes that they either deal with points of detail or Avith the structure of the texts in question and that, accordingly, their discussion should bo reserAred for a later stage.Pacific Settlement of Disputes.13. The present text of the CoA^lieutenant recognises the binding and executory character of arbitral awards on judicial decisions. Where, hoAveArer, a case is submitted to the Council, a unanimous recommendation alone has some legal consequences, since it is forbidden to resort to Avar against the party which conforms to it. The mere extension of the prohibition of recourse to Avar Avould by itself give the same force to majority decisions of the Council and thus eliminate all distinction betAveen unanimous decisions and majority decisions. In neither case Avould such decisions possess an obligatory or executory character.14. It should be emphasised in the first place that this defect has now been removed in the case of disputes between States both of which have acceded to the General Act of Arbitration, without any restriction or reservation affecting the third part of the Act, or which have concluded bilateral agreements having a similar effect. If the dispute occurs between two States which are bound to submit it to arbitration, its peaceful settlement is already ensured by the operation of the existing proAdsions of the CoA-lieutenant.But Avhile we may congratulate ourselves upon the growing number of accessions to the General Act of Arbitration, it Avould, in the opinion of the A^ery great majority of the Committee, be premature to seek at present to embody in the Covenant of the League, by means of an amendment, the rigid principle of obligation to resort to arbitration or judicial settlement for all disputes.15. In vieAv of this situation, a certain number of States haA^e taken the AdeAv that, in accordance A\dth the proposals made by the Committee of Ehwen, it is desirable at least to proAdde in the CoArenant that Members of the League must carry out in good faith the unanimous recommendations of the Council, and to entrust to the latter the duty of proposing suitable measures to ensure that its unanimous recommendations should be carried into effect.To justify this extension of the effect of unanimous recommendations, it Avas proposed to provide that the Council might, by a majority A^ote, ask the Court for an advisory opinion on points of laAv release-ant to the dispute. Further, Avith regard to Council reports adopted by a majority, it Avas contemplated that the Council should recommend to the parties the most appropriate neAv procedure.The discussions in the Committee confirmed the opinion abeady expressed by last year&apos;s Sub-Committee that an amendment of this character would not secure the necessary ratifications.16. The texts of the amendments to Article 15 proposed by last year&apos;s Sub-Committee must be admitted to be capable of improA^ement, seeing that, in paragraph 6, it is proAdded that the Council shall recommend the parties to comply with the conclusions of a unanimous report, and this is, after all, as is pointed out in the observations of the GoA^ernment of Finland, no more than a repetition of Avhat is already to be found in paragraph 4 of the present Article 15. It must be recognised, howeArer, that the undertaking the other Members of the League are asked to give   namely, that they Avill in no way support the parties Avho do not comply Avith unanimous recommendations   does strengthen to some extent the proAdsions of the CoA^lieutenant. In short, such a provision Avould have the effect of tacitly establishing for the Members of the League a kind of moral obligation to comply Avith the unanimous recommendations of the Council - a moral obligation
whose only sanction would be the duty of the other Members of the League to refrain from action if the State in question were subjected to certain forms of peaceful pressure by the other party.The Committee is of opinion that it would in any case be necessary to lay some stress upon the exact scope of the proposed amendment by replacing the word &quot; recommandc &quot;, by the somewhat stronger word &quot; invitem &quot;. the equivalent of which is already employed in the English text.In the course of the discussion, the Finnish delegation submitted an interesting suggestion which somewhat modifies the text already put forward in the Finnish Governmenfs observations.  The Finnish delegation proposes to say :&quot; If the report of the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the party which complies with the recommendations of the report may base its claim thereon, the solution recommended by the Council being incapable of being put in question except as the result of an arbitral or judicial decision. The Members of the League undertake in no way to support any party in refusal to comply with the recommendations of a report which has been unanimously accepted &quot;&apos;.On examination, however, it was felt that the legal effect of such a text was too uncertain and that it would require further examination.17. As regards the hypothesis of the Council being divided, the Finnish delegation asks that the amended Covenant should make it clearer than the present one does that, in that event, the CounciPs deliberations, in conformity with Article 1, would have the same object as in cases where it is unanimous   namely, to bring about a solution of the dispute in the form of a recommendation.The Finnish delegation accordingly proposes the following text:&quot; If the Council has failed to reach unanimity as defined in the previous paragraph and if the parties do not accept the recommendations made by the majority, the Council shall officially and by a majority vote suggest the best procedure to be followed in the circumstances and shall recommend it to the parties &quot;.The Committee decided that the foregoing proposal might usefully be accepted as a basis for subsequent discussion.Extension or the Pacificatory Action of the Council.18. The question which arises is whether, when the prohibition of recourse to war becomes general, it will be necessary to limit the individual obligations of the Members of the League regarding participation in sanctions.The Governments which have pronounced for the affirmative answer have contended:(1) Tha,t the desire to effect an extension of sanctions corresponding to the extension of the prohibitions of resort to war contained in the Covenant arose from pushing too far the analogy with the conception of crime and punishment in municipal law ;(2) That the operation of the system of sanctions presumed that the aggressor had been determined, that the Covenant itself gave no indications on this subject, and tha&apos;&quot; strong differences of opinion might in fact arise in the Council which would render the application of sanctions impossible or ineffective ;(3) That the only practical way of improAdng the application of the system of sanctions consisted in adopting provisions analogous to the draft Convention for the development of methods for preventing war, under which the collective action would be started, not as the result of answering the difficult question as to who had violated the Covenant, but owing to the refusal of a party to comply with recommendations of the Council for the withdrawal of armed forces behind a determined line or the cessation of hostilities.The Governments holding this opinion have expressed the desire that, at any rate, cases in which the Council was divided on the question as to who Avas the aggressor, or as to the interim measures of protection which should be recommended to the parties in order to prevent or suspend hostihties, should be excluded from the contemplated extension of sanctions. In those A^various cases, they considered that the material or moral difficulties in the Avay of carrying out obligations of mutual assistance Avould be too great for it to be possible to claim execution of such obligations.As in the discussions of previous years, howeArer, the opinion has prevailed in the Committee that any distinction of this kind ought to be rejected. It seems, neA^ertheless, that the discussion has made it possible to remoA^e certain misconceptions on the subject.19. In the first place, it has been recognised that those AAdio held the above^e opinion Avere right in rejecting any too narroAv conception of the problem of sane!ions. The primary purpose of the CounciPs action is to piwent or stop hostilities and effect a pacification before it enquires into questions of responsibility and ensures the settlement of the dispute.It is equally true that the obligations assumed by the Members of the League of Nations for the purpose of maintaining peace, although they rest upon each Member individually, imply a certain agreement among them, a co-operation in common action. If the Members
of the League found themselves deeply divided in the views which they took of a particular situation, common action would no doubt in fact be suspended ; but it would be for the Council to re-establish unanimity by adopting interim measures of protection such as are contemplated in the draft Convention on the Means for preventing War. If the continuance of too numerous divergences of view created a situation altogether different from that which Members of the League must be deemed to have contemplated, it would be impossible to expect that the Members of the League would carry out obligations undertaken on an entirely different basis. In such a case, it makes little difference whether the original dispute was submitted to the Council of the League of Nations or to arbitration.On the other hand, it seems impossible to claim that Members of the League of Nations which considered that it was clear who was the aggressor, and that common action was possible, should abstain from carrying out the obligations which rest upon them individually under the first paragraph of Article 16 of the Covenant for the sole reason that formal unanimity had not been obtained in the Council.Accordingly, a reasonable interpretation of our charter of association seems to answer the fears which have been expressed. These fears, moreover, appear exaggerated and it would be wrong to weaken confidence in the wisdom of the CounciPs action and in the good faith which the generality of the Members of the League would shown in carrying out their obligations.20. Further, if the proposed exceptions were examined in the light of the existing Covenant, it would be seen that their effect would be to diminish appreciably the guarantees which the CoArenant already affords. The obligations of the individual Members of the League under Article 16 of the existing text of the Covenant are not subject to the condition that the Council must have taken a decision as to who is the aggressor.21. To make such a distinction would from the moral point of viewr have the disad-vantage of making recourse to wyar, which would in general be forbidden under the Covenant as amended, appear in some cases not to be subject to sanctions.22. It must, however, be recognised that the principal difficulty in the task of amendment which has been undeitaken, and the only serious obstacle to its success, still lies in the hesitation of ceitain Members of the League to agree to an extension of their existing obligations to give assistance, even if such extension is only theoretical.It may be hoped that agreement would be greatly facilitated by the entry into force of a general Convention for the reduction of armaments. Certain Members of the League, for example, had announced their intention of making their ratification of the amendment of the Covenant conditional on the entry into force of the Convention for the Reduction of Armaments. Other Governments have expressed, as the date of the Conference draws near, preoccupations wdiich Avould appear to be satisfied to some extent by the adoption of the proposed amendment.Thus, on the eve of the Conference, the link between the two undertakings has been further strengthened. Certain States have expressed a desire to know, before giving an opinion on the amendment of the Covenant, to what extent and for how long the Convention for the reduction of armaments will satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the Covenant.Such being the case, it would be inexpedient to attempt at present to frame final texts. The most suitable method would appear to be for the Assembly to set up a committee for the amendment of the Covenant, consisting of representatives of the Members of the League, in order that they may, during the Conference for the Reduction of Armaments, endeavour to arrive at unanimous agreement on the bases set forth in the present report. The amendments might then be finally voted during the next session of the Assembly.Draft Resolution.&quot; The Assembly,&quot; Taking note of the report approved by the First Committee :&quot; Reaffirms its intention of continuing the task, of inserting in the Covenant of the League of Nations a general prohibition of recourse to war and the principle that the settlement of international disputes may only be sought by pacific methods ;&quot; Decides to create a committee consisting of representatives of all the Members of the League of Nations, which may meet during the Conference for the Reduction of Armaments for the purpose of seeking unanimous agreement on the bases indicated in the report and of drawing up a final text which may be voted by the Assembly at its next session ;&quot; Requests the Council to convene the Committee for the date which it considers appropriate ;&quot; Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the present resolution and the report to the Members of the League of Nations, in order that, if they consider it necessary, they may send to the Council their views as to the lines on which they think agreement could be attained.&quot;
