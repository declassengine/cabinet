COPY HO.C A B I RET.Draft Reply to French Memorandum on..Reparations (See CP.510(31).) as approved &quot;by the Cabinet Committee on Reparations and far Debts at their Meeting on DeclSth.1931.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have studied with   the greatest care the Memorandum stating the point uf view of the French Government in regard tc) Reparations.    H.M. Government are deeply improcced, aa no doubt are the French Government also, with the vital necessity for rcetshing a satis-factory settlement of the problem of reparation and war debts without delay and they therefore welcome the full and authoritative statement of the views uf the French Government and desire -in reply to state their own views -with, tqual frankness.2. The point cf view of H.M.Government is as follows.-In July last the London Conferoncfa r&amp;commended that the commercial creditors of Germany should agree tu maintain the volume of their existing credits to Germany and that a Committee ahould be appointed to enquire into the further credit noeds of Germany.      In making this&quot;recommendatitm the-Governments at the rfiame time gave the assurance that &quot;in order to ensure the maintenance of tho financial stability of Germany,  th^y (the Governments) were ready to co-operate, ao far as lies within their power, to restore confidence.&quot;     The Conference also expryssed the view that if the measure-i they recommended -were carried through, they would form &quot;a basis of more permanent action to fellow&quot;.    The measures propoyed by the London Conference were duly carried out;    the &quot;Wiggin.-Committco&quot; wa-j -appointed by the; Bank for International
Settlements-and &apos;the Tanking -cr-edi-ts- -were,  cm-the faith of the declarations made by the London Conference, maintained at their existing volume till February 29th,   1932, by means of the Standstill agreements.3. In their Report, the Wiggin Committee emphasised the need for the Governments to act without delay,    &quot;We feel certain&quot;, they said &quot;that the Government1s representatives at the London Conference, in taking the responsibility of recommending to the Bankers of the world that they should take concerted measures to maintain the volume of the credits they had already extended to Germany, fully realised that their proposal was net a solution of the problem buta means of gaining time, during which steps for re-establish ing the credit of Germany might be taken&quot;.&quot;But. time is short.      The body of the world&apos;s -      - -commerce - whose vitality is already low - has suffered a severe shock in one of its chief members.    This has resulted in a partial paralysis which can enly be cured by restoring the free circulation of money and of goods.    We believe that this can be accomplished;    but only if the Governments of the world will realise the responsibilit3&apos;&apos; that rests upon them and will talse prompt measures to re-establish confidence Their action alone can restore it.     We think it essential that, before the.period of prolongation of credits recommended by the London Conference comes to an end,  they should give to the world the assurance that international political relations are established on a basis of mutual confidence, which is the sine qua non of economic recovery, and that the international payments to be made by Germany will not be such as to imperil the maintenance of her financial stability&quot;.
4. Subsequent events have &quot;fully confirmed-the-, justice- ...and urgency of this recommendation.      The severity of the economic crisis,  as the French Government recognise,    has become greatly intensified, not only in Germany and her neighbours, but throughout the world.    The collapse of credit and exchanges is rapidly leading to an economic paralysis throughout Burcpe.    Much more far-reaching remedies are now necessary than might have sufficed a year or even six months ago.    Unless confidence can be speedily restored, it is impossi-ble to foretell what disastrous repercussions the present crisis may have on the economic structure of the civilized world. 5, The -precise extent of the action to be taken bythe Government remains to be settled.It has been agreed that in the first instance,  the situation of Germany should be examined by the Special Advisory Committee   provided for by the Young Plan.    This Committee is appointed by the Governors of the Central Banks and is not responsible to the Governments or subject to their instructions, ana it is for the Committee to determine the procedure which it should follow in its inquiry.    But His Majesty&apos;s Government are in full accord with the French Government in desiring the Committee to undertake a thorough examination of all the aspects of the German financial situation without any limitation,  and to recommend, with the authority that their international reputation -as experts in monetary and economic affairs murft command,  the measures required to restore the stability of the German currency and budget and to permit the revival of normal economic and financial life both in Germany and in the rest of the! world;    and finally to state what steps are required, in the light of Germany&apos;s capacity .jf /
payment.  to enable this result to he achieved.    It will then he lor the Governments concerned; hearing in mind the under-takings entered into at the London Conference, to take such decisions in regard to reparations as may make it possible for the credit of Germany to he restored,,6. Germany, of course, remains hound by the HagueAgreement unless and until that agreement is modified by consento     But as the French Government recognise, the economic crisis which has since developed has made the fulfilment of the Young Plan, as it stands, *e-l-eaa?ly impossible and the ewsa^fc question is what adaptations are necessary to meet the present situation.      That question will have to be considered by the Governments in the light of the reccmmend.aticns formulated by the Special Advisory Committee,  and His Majesty&apos;3 Government do-not consider that it Is right or wi&amp;ie to formulate limitations beforehand.    It is always open to a creditor ts revise a settlement which has proved unworkable and a wise creditor will do an hetlmeti rather than force his debtor into liquidation,, What is a pound business principle in regard, to privateclaims is a^aJielucious necessity in regard to international claimras the economic and financial interests of all countries are inextricably connected and the financial andeeonemic collapse of any one ration must inevitably produce the gravest effects throughout the rest of the wr.rlda7U Accordingly, until the Report of the Advisory Committeehas been received,  it would olearly be premature for the Government to formulate their views in detail.    But there are certain bread principles which must, in tho opinion of His Majesty7s Government, be regarded as fundamental.     A settle-went is required which will restore the credit of Germanys
and this can only be attained by an arrangement which will ensure that the governmental obligations of the Germany will not endanger the economic life of the country and preclude its citizens from duly honouring obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business. 

8. The foregoing considerations are in ? with many of the principles enunciated in the French Government&apos;s memorandum. But some of the specific stipulations put forward by the French Government ? with these principles. The satisfactory reparation settlement, which it is essential to achieve without delay, cannot be secured by each Creditor Power bringing to the discussion a settled series of demands before Germany&apos;s capacity ? has been determined as the result? an  impartial enquiry into the facts by the Advisory Committee.

9. There is another aspect of this question to which His Majesty&apos;s Government ? to refer. The French Government state that it is the firm determination of France at the forthcoming Conference to insist on retaining her "solde" or surplus of reparation receipts over war debt payments. ? such a proposal calculated to appeal to the Governments to which War Debts are due as a ground for reducing such Debts. ? arrangement ? France ? pass on to Germany any concession made to her by others, would be merely not sacrifice any of her own surplus ? of receipts.

?
*5 f; this Majesty&apos;s Government would add that, while the Young Plan allotted to certain Bowers a surplus over their net war debt annuities, there is nothing in the Plan which gives such surpluses any priority or preference as regards the distribution of tfche annuities.    In so far therefore as any reparations paymenta are available,  the grant of a priority of any hind f-jr the Frence &quot;solde&quot; wouldyrepresent an innovation in favour of France *aed to the detriment of this Country wtetefe-a-fe would not $jf possible for any British Government to contemplate,,On the other hand,  it will always be the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to /make any concession to the French Government where that can be done without sacrificing the legitimate interests of this country,  and it is in this spirit that they have decided, while reserving their rights, to authorise the Bank of /international Settlements not to demand the deposit of the French Guarantee Fund&apos; on the con-vening of the Special Advisory Committee. 10o There is one other point which His Majesty&apos;3Government must emphasise0      During the past few years,  the United Kingdom has contributed in far larger measure than France to the maintenance of German economic life.    It has done co. partly by putting at the disposal of Germany commercial and banking credits.,  amounting altogether to
14*-os-close on  80 million.        These credits v/er6^    -&apos;0-t La ^c4   ^not    speculative   investments^a-ttr&apos;ac&apos;ted&quot; hy----tE5&quot;prospects of&quot;&quot; a high   return ^^a-V-i-a..^   tv--   tJ3g::gaiJx-^Qjme^li.nll,, crftdi.t,.su^-f a. self-li qui datingcharacter and representative heat type of hanking security.     But It&quot;also helped German trade hy offering a free market to her goods such as none i     of the other creditor Governments have.given.j$,a*&amp; result of this policy, Germany has during&quot; the past  three years, had a net favourable balance of trade amounting to about  100 millions, if only the British exports to Germany are taken into account,  and of over  50 millions, if ^o-exporto from the United Kingdom as well as British exports, are included.    The sterling resources thus placed at the disposal of Germany have undoubtedly contributed in no small measure to the payments, which Prance has received for reparations.    But it is net possible for this country to continue indefinitely a policy of fostering international c o mm e r c e $r --e Jbjetf2-jiai4&quot;^^r-epe-est-e;    and His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be expected to continue a system which providers resources for the payment of reparations to Prance if the payment of British private claims is not to be absolutely assured.271(
11. HoKo Government have entered into these detailedexplanations in response to the request of the French Government for an exchange of views.      But they desire, above all, to emphasise the urgent need of a solution of the whole question cf inter-governmental indebtedness which is something more than a makeshift.      In their belief it is in the interests of all the nations of the world to arrive at a settlement which will relieve the exchanges from the actual and prospective risks created by the existing mass of unproductive debts. Such a settlement would in their view  be the most practicable step that could be taken to release the world from the present economic depression.      On the other hand if such a settlement cannot be attained,  that depression will continue and must inevitably be accentuated with consequences of a social and political as well as of a financial and economic character which it would be difficult to exaggerate .      The fate of Europe for many years to come may depend on the decisions to be taken by the Governments at the forthcoming Conference: and HoLic Government consider that it is the duty of statemen in all countries to approach the Conference with the single aim of ensuring a settlement^ which will form a basi3 for restoring confidence arid rebuilding prosperity.12c H.M. Government&apos; have stated their views frankly,even though at some points they differ from those of the French Government in the /-8-
conviction that it is only by frankness that differing points of view can be understood and agreement reached.    It will always be the desire of H.M.Government to co-operate closely with the French Government in dealing with the reparation problem and to endeavour by friendly discussion to reach agreement as to the best method of maintaining the peace and restoring the prosperity of Europe, which is the ussunon aim of both countries.Whitehall Gardens, &amp;;.ft.lt-i December 15th, 1931.
