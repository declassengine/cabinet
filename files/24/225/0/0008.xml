-J   -s111THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.CRET. NO.      0Ip 508 (31) Town and Country Planning *Memorandum by the Minister of Health.The late Government introduced a Town and Country Planning Bill in the last Session of Parliament.     The Bill was prepared after many conferences with representatives of Local Authorities and of property interests.     The Bill was supported from all sides of the House, and the Second Reading was passed without a division.     The Bill was very fully considered in Committee on twenty-one days, many amendments were made and it emerged practically as an agreed measure. The Dissolution prevented further progress. &quot;I have received resolutions from a number of organisations pressing strongly for the reintroduction of the Bill.     There is no question of the urgent need of a raeasure on this subject.     The powers of Local Authorities to prepare planning schemes are at present limited mainly to areas likely to be developed.     This restriction causes serious difficulty in the administration of the present law.     But there is also a very strong demand for extending the powers to areas already developed (a)  in order that redevelopment may be controlled (and it is as necessary to regulate redevelopment as entirely new development); and (b)  in order that publio improvements which are required to meet modern conditions may be carried out to a definite plan, and the inevitable waste which has occurred on a large so ale in the past may be avoided.     As for rural areas, it is scarcely necessary for me to point out the urgent need of measures for preserving the amenities of the countryside, and the strong publio opinion in favour of suoh action.
Legislation on this question would he a definite measure of economy ana an integral part of the work of &quot;rationalisation&quot; needed for prosperity.     One of the principal objects of a gooa regional plan is to provide proper facilities for industry and commerce and to prevent the reoklesa destruction of property values which too frequently takes place when development is not regulated.I shall be glad to receive authority to introduce a Bill at as early date as possible in the next Session.The course which I should then propose to take is to subject the Bill of last Session, as it emerged from Committee, to a careful examination with a view to seeing what changes or amendments are desirable, consulting any organisations whose views it may be desirable to ascertain in order to secure as large a measure of agreement as possible.(Intld.)     E.H. YDecember 4th, 1931-
