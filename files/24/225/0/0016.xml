I0DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.RET. CABINET, COPY NO.  .JH____P. 516 (51).WEEKLY ISSUE OP UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour. It has long seemed to me, and I think to others, that the practice followed during the past twelve years of issuing weekly figures of unemployment to the Press is an unhealthy one. The figures are necessarily crude and open to misconstruction, particularly by foreign observers, and the effect of the weekly issue, and of the use and misuse to which it has been put, has been prejudicial to our trade interests.The practice of other countries is set out in the Appendix. Hardly any other country issues any but monthly figures. Germany issues a fortnightly figure and Poland issues weekly figures once a fortnight.    France issues a weekly figure which is valueless as an indication of the real state of unemployment.The possibility of discontinuing the weekly figures and substituting a monthly issue, which could be made more elaborate and informative, has been considered once or twice in the past. The last occasion was soon after the Labour Government came into office in 1929;    they consulted the other two Parties but agree-ment could not be reached and the proposal v/as dropped.We are in a stronger position to take action, and after careful consideration, and some consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, I have come to the conclusion that we ought to make the change.There are some difficulties of detail but they can be overcome and I need not trouble my colleagues with them.The only point on which I have felt doubt is whether the events of the past few months have not altered the balance of argument.    Six months ago I should have felt no hesitation at all
but since then we have rehabilitated ourselves financially and economically and the psychological effect of the figures is not what it was.    V/e might even be throwing away a good advertise-ment, if the figures continue to decline.    There may possibly also be a risk that a change made now might be interpreted abroad as indicating a lack of confidence in cur position.These considerations have to be weighed but I am satisfied that, taking a long view,  the right course is to break away from this practice and to do it at once.Figures must, I think, be issued- once a month.    They would relate to a date towards the end of the month and would give the numbers of insured persons in employment as well as the number unemployed,  together with other detailso    They could not be issued as promptly as the present crude weekly figures and would come out about a fortnight or three weeks after the date to which they relate,  or possibly not until the Ministry of Labour Gazette is published on the 18th of  the month.    The general result would be that the air of sensationalism now attaching to the weekly issue would disappear and the figures when issued would be a good deal more elaborate, more informative,and less open to misinterpretation.I should propose to make the change at the end of thisyear.    The last figure on the weekly basis would be that for 21st December, issued about 3rd January;    the next figure wouldbe for 25th January,  on the new basis,  issued about the second week in February.Notice of the change and of the reasons for it would be given to the Press sometime in December.I ask for authority to take action accordingly. 11th December, 1931.

A P PEE D IX. PERIODICITY OP UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS OP OVERSEAS COUNTRIES.So far as is known,  only one country - Prance -publishes figures of unemployment at weekly intervals. The figures relate to the numbers on the registers of public Labour Exchanges and. the numbers receiving benefit.     Large numbers of those unemployed are not covered by these figures.In Poland, the numbers on the registers of Employment Exchanges and the numbers on benefit are compiled for each week,  and published at fortnightly intervals.In New Zealand,  statistics of the numbers on the registers of Employment Bureaux are compiled weekly, but are published only at monthly intervals.In Germany, figures are published twice a month (in respect of the 15th and of the last day of the month) showing (l)    the numbers registered as available for work, (2)    the numbers of these who are unemployed,  and (3)  the numbers on benefit.      Statistics of unemployment among trade union members in Germany are published at monthly intervals.In the following countries,   the figures(which vary considerably in their scope and nature) are compiled and published at monthly intervals:BelgiumDenmarkSwitzerlandSwedenItalyCanadaHollandUnited StatesNorwayJ apan-
1IIIn Holland,  though figures are compiled as to the unemployed members of insurance funds in tv/o selected weeks of each month,  they are published only once a month.In Czechoslovakia statistics of the numbers of registered unemployed and the numbers receiving benefit are compiled monthly, but published at intervals of tv/o months.In Australia the percentages unemployed among members of trade unions are compiled and published for one v/eek in each quarter.
