CABINET. RUBBERcMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Some weeks ago the Dutch Government suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Government, that informal discussions might usefully take place between representatives of the Dutch Government and Dutch rubber producers and similar representa-tives in this country.    The Dutch Government was informed that we should welcome such a discussion, provided that at an early stage in such a discussion the question of making a scheme administratively and politically practicable in the Netherlands East Indies was taken up and settled.    At the same time I saw confidentially representatives of the Rubber Grower Association in this country and found that they were in agree-ment with the desirability of such negotiations and the course which they should follow,.Conversations have no1// taken place between repre-sentatives of the Dutch and British Colonial Offices and Dutch and British rubber producers0    In the course of these discussions a number of possible schemes   were reviewed; and it was unanimously agreed that the only scheme which would be&apos; practicable and acceptable would be a quota scheme., under which a basic tonnage would be fixed for each producing country and a production and export quota allotted
-f:.o each country-Agreement vis.b also reached as tothe general lines on whicb such a scheme must he framed It was then decided that the British and Dutch rubher growers should work our the details of a scheme -    Thi3 has now been lone;  and the attached scheme has been agreed by the rubber growers&apos; representative for submission to their respective Governments.of ba,3io world tonnage production is agreed at 860,000 tons;    consumption today is agreed to be at the rate of 500,000 tons; existing stocks are agreed at roughly 600,000 tens;    and the normal stock which the industry should aim at carrying is agreed at a half y ears cos sumption, Leo 300,000 tons at present-gradual reduction of stocks to this figure end to reach and maintain a fair equilibrium of production find demand.     The basic tonnage which it is pro-posed to ai! lot to each&quot; eotintr-y ia the maximum export of such country in the highest of the last three years and these are set out in the eoheai-So   Allowance is also mado for a small progressive increase in the basic tonnages of Ceylon, Jlalaya as).d the Hetherlands Sast Indies to allow for immature rubber plantations coming into production during the currency of the scheme.Act international committee would administer the scheme and fix the production quota at regularShortly tha scheme is as followsoA figureThe object of the scheme is toan sr. re a
periods. . This quota would he allotted to each country in proportion to its basic national tonnage.    The Government in each country would he responsible for allotting its quota among its producers and ensuring that production and export were in conformity with the quota.    It is suggested that the initial quota ought to be 5c o of basic tonnage.    This would permit of the excess stock of 300,000 tons being absorbed on present consumption at the rate of 100,000 tons a year.    It is proposed that the scheme should operate for a minimum period of five years.The Cabinet are aware of the deplorable state of the rubber industry to-day, and of the effect of this upon all rubber companies and upon the economic position of Malaya and Caylon.    They are equally alive to the repercussions of this depression on National income and on exchange.    There is, I think, general agreement that it is of the utmost importance to secure an international agreement which is com-perhensive in the area covered, administratively practicable and generally acceptable to tie industry. All these conditions are necessary, and the most important as well as the most difficult factor in the situation is to ensure that any scheme proposed is one which the Netherlands Oast Indies Government is willing to accept and able to enforce.    I ask the Cabinet to agree in principle    to the adoption of a restriction scheme which s atisfies the above
(i ^ -&apos;jconditions,  and to approve of ray carrying forward negotiations on the general lines of tho scheme now proposed.        Having received that authority I should propose at once to endeavour to obtain the concurrence of the Netherlands East Indies through the Butch Government and of the Governments in Malaya and Gsylon to a scheme on the lines I hove set out. As soon as I know that the scheme is regarded as acceptable and practicable by these three Governments^ I should proposes through the proper channels, to approach the other Governments of countries in the Par East, which are responsible for comparatively small production, but whom it is desirable to bring in to any comprehensive scheme,      Their inclusion is desirable and should be secured if possible, but if we can agree a scheme which will cover all Dutch and British production,  its operation should not be delayed by protracted negotiations   with the small producers.It is very important,  if progress is to be made with this scheme, that action should be taken immediately, and the industry are rightly insistent that a decision should be reached with the least possible delay.      I, therefore, ask that this question may be treated as a. matter of extreme urgency,(intd.)     P.C.L.olonial Office, Downing Street, S. w&quot;, 1. , 12th December, 1931.
OUTLINES OP RUBBER QUOTA SCHEMEAll the principal Rubber producing territories in the East should, if possible, bo brought into the scheme at the starts    Quota for each country to be the actual export figures,   selecting the highest in years 1929, 1930 (or 19 3l)0The approximate figures are:-Malaya 455,500 tonsN.E.i3 255,500Ceylon. 80,300India and Burma 11,700Bo No Borneo 7,400Sarawak 11,300Siam 5,000Brunei &amp; Labuan I?100827,800(?)

&apos;    2UAfter a review cf all relevant factors it is suggested that the following automatic increases to the quota figures might he adopted for 1933, 1934 and 19360Add for each of these    years to the original quota figures progressivelyfor Ceylon lft,Other countries to &quot;   Malaya 2% he similarlyreviewed.&quot;    1T.I3.I. 5%making on original quota figures	in 1933	1933.	1934	1935	1936,Ceyl n	100?.:	101%	102?:.	.. 103?:	104?&quot;Malaya	100;:i	102&apos;/	lew.?:	106??,   -	ioo?:2To .:Jb I o	100?l	105^	110%	1155-	12C?iThe scheme to &quot;be operated through an International Advisory Committee comprising representatives of the Governments concerned., of Producers and cf Manufacturers0     The Committee wj.ll recommend the percentage   rate of quotas which may &quot;be exported from time to tine-     The participating Government should agree to accept any recommendation made unanimously &quot;by the CcmaitteecThe percentage cf permissible exports is to bo governed by changes in the stock position in the principal consuming countries having regard also to price movements,  the objective being to reduce existing excessive world stocks to a normal figure and to keep supplies in harmony with vrorld. requirements at a moderate level of price sufficient to give a reasonable return to efficient producersoIt is suggested tr.at it would bo reasonable for working stocks outside producing countries to bo the equivalent of six months&apos; consumption at the rate current for the time being.The rate of export at the introduction of the scheme must be low enough to ensure beyond any possible doubt an appreciable inroad being made in the already too high accumulated stocks0 It is considered that the percentage of exports at the start should be on the safe side at 50c/.o
The distribution of the quota amongst the producers in each territory is to he left to each Government.      It is anticipated that a system of production and export licences will he adopted, and provision he made to allow of these &quot;being transferable so that the less efficient producers who might prefer to leave their trees untapped could sell their production and export rights and use the proceeds for maintaining their &quot;Estates, Great importance is attached to the introduction of effective arrange-ments which will secure that in each territory production shall be limited as closely as possible to the permissable exports.The International Committee should have monthly meetings to review the working of the scheme and to consider the percentage exportable-      No alteration shall be made in the percentage exportable until three months have elapsed from the date of any pirtvious change.-No area planted, or reptlanted, with Rubber after the date this scheme commences shall be allowed to participate in the quota unless the exportable percentage has been maintained at 1007o for 12 consecutive months.The Governments should agree not to alienate further land for Rubber planting for a minimum term of 5 years, and natives should be discouraged from further planting by all administrative moans possible for the same periodsIt is a fundamental condition that the scheme should be adopted for five years, and that no participating Government shall be at liberty to withdraw during that period,,      Thereafter withdrawals will be subject to at least six months&apos; notice.In the interests of the Industry it is e ssential that a definite decision be come to at the earliest possible moment one way or the other,.
