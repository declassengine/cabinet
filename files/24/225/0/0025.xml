THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government confidential. Copy No.    9CP. 325 (31).CABINET.Communicated to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by the French Ambassador, December 14, 1931.(Translation.)Memorandum.THE French tax of 15 per cent, is considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by British public opinion as directed against British merchandise, and in particular against coal.The measure in question does not concern solely England, but thirteen countries which benefit in the French market by the export bounty which results from the depreciation of their national currencies. So far as Great Britain is concerned, the 15 per cent, tax only very partially compensates for the currency depreciation, because the index of wholesale prices is actually 30 per cent, less than its September level.In spite of the 15 per cent, tax, British merchandise therefore still enjoys an advantage as compared with merchandise coming from countries whose currency has not depreciated. In these conditions there is no justification for invoking the most-favoured-nation clause.Further, the tax is subject to revision every month, and would tend to decrease in proportion as wholesale prices in England rise.The British Government imposed no surtax upon French imports into England at the time of the depreciation of the franc : The French Government has never contested the friendly character of the attitude taken at that time by the British Government. At the time of the depreciation of the franc France alone was concerned. To-day the situation is quite different. In thirteen countries exports are stimulated by depreciation of the national currencies, and threaten the economy of French production. Finally, in order to defend her finances France has never imposed on foreign imports customs measures as severe as those which have recently been adopted in Great Britain.Application of the French tax of 15 per cent, to coal imported from Great Britain :  This measure has not curtailed the sales of British exporters, and the licences put at&apos; the disposal of Great Britain have continued to be utilised. The sole result of the tax has been to divert into the Treasury a sum which, up to the present, has gone to the profit of French importers.However, M. Laval, considering that the application of the tax to coal has given rise to very strong protest in Great Britain, and desiring to keep Franco-British relations out of these discussions, has considered the desirability of suppressing this tax in so far as coal is concerned.The competent French services have called his attention to the fact that the sale of English coal at the present price, due to the fall of the pound, would cause very great disturbances in French economy. Those parts of the country which are supplied with French coal, which is thus made more expensive than English coal, would not be able to compete with the industrial zone fed by English coal, as the following example proves. In the case of two glass factories situated, one at Lyons, and the.other at Bordeaux, the position is that, up to September, the second received bottles from the first, while since September the situation is reversed.6120   [6318]
In these conditions a simple withdrawal of the surtax would present grave difficulties. It would, however, perhaps be possible if English sellers could guarantee that their sale prices in France would not henceforward be sensibly less than French prices. This guarantee could not but give, advantages to the English sellers if the licences at present open to them continued to be reserved for them. A proposal of this kind could only be put forward from the British side, since the French Government could not expose themselves to a charge which French consumers of English coal might make against them of having increased prices.However that may be, the French Government would be happy to find a ground of agreement and to study with the British Government suggestions which might be put forward.The British Government is, at the moment, subject to very strong pressure by the interested parties, who are supported in Parliament, on the subject of the French tax : - It would be essential that the French Government should be placed in a position to defend before their own public opinion any concessions which they might be induced to make. If they could be given the assurance that the list of industrial products subject to tax in England is now closed, and that, in the application of the law on the subject of agricultural products recently passed, French exporters will be considered to the fullest possible extent, the position would be greatly eased.The French decree of the 1st August on exchange surtaxes has just been modified, and all the countries concerned are now placed on equal footing. A memorandum relative to this question, and to recent customs measures taken by England, will shortly be transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government.December 13, 1931.
