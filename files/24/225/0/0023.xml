This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government Printed for the Cabinet, December, 1931.SECRET.CP. 323 (31).THE CABINET.HOME PRODUCED MEAT AND BREAD FOR THE FORCES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The election programme of the Conservative Government in 1959 included proposals that home-fed beef should be supplied to the Fighting Forces at home for 6 months in the year, and that flour supplied to Army and Air Force bakeries for the 6 months after harvest should contain a certain percentage of English wheat. The possibility of giving effect to these proposals was considered by the Labour Govem-ment in 1929 and 1930, but they were rejected on economic and financial grounds. This matter will necessarily be raised again in the near future a question on the subject has already been asked in the House of Commons and I have therefore asked the War Office to prepare a memorandum dealing with the proposals from the standpoint of cost and of practicability, which I circulate for the information of my colleagues.I must add a warning that I am quite unable to find money for this change from Army Estimates. The War Office was asked in the summer to reduce the Estimates for 1932 by no less a sum than  3,693,000, but, owing to subsequent concessions approved by the Government, I am very doubtful whether I can produce the total saving. Any additional charge, therefore, in a matter which is of no military advantage to the Army, is beyond my capacity to meet.H.The War Office,loth December, 1931.Copt No.OI.--Meat.I. As was pointed out in 1929, the supply of fresh in lieu of frozen meat to the troops at home would involve heavy additional expenditure on Army and Air Force Votes without any compensating reduction or any benefit to the Services. The extra cost of supplying fresh meat to the Army and Air Force throughout the year is estimated at some  500,000, on the assumption that no advance in the price-level of fresh meat results ; if the adoption of the proposal should lead to a general rise in that price-level (and such a rise would be the natural effect, as it is presumably also4-X-t. s\     *v-i r\-i *\     y\ Y\t onf       r\t&quot; c-rt Y\ am ci \      4- Vi 4-n in n/Mi t-* ri     Vt-vr   tw!% -h-*V\    4-1-*^ - J.price of fresh meat was raised would mean an additional cost of over  30,000 a year.2. So far from benefiting the troops, there is a risk that the scheme will result in a deterioration in the quality of the supplies. Experience of the fresh meat system before the war showed that there was very great difficulty in maintaining the requisite quality, and attempts to pass inferior supplies were of frequent occurrence. The Dominion meat at present issued to the troops is carefully graded and marked before export, thus ensuring satisfactory supply. Whilst it is true that the &quot; National Mark &quot; scheme aims at fulfilling a similar function in the case of home-killed beef, it must be borne in mind that it is still of very limited application, and that the available supplies of &quot; National Mark &quot; beef would probably be inadequate to meet the widely-distributed needs of thetB31/8)   70   12/31   w.o.p.   5919
troops. It is, therefore, likely that any attempt to exclude meat not so graded would not only be doomed to failure but would cause a sharp increase in the price of such supplies as were obtainable. There is also the danger that the feeding of the troops would be liable to be disorganized at any time by outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, involving prohibition of the movement of cattle within specified areas, which have been frequent in recent years.3. Nor is there any certainty that the home farmer, in whose interests the change in present policy is urged, would reap the benefit of the financial burden which would be imposed on the Services. Fresh meat may be the produce either of (i) animals raised in this country or (ii) imported animals fattened here for some months before slaughter or (iii) imported animals killed on disembarkation at the port of entry. The form which the proposal has more usually taken is that the troops&quot;should be supplied with meat of class (i) or. class (ii), but it would be quite impracticable to ensure by inspection that supplies actually beionged to either class ; even experts are doubtful of their ability to distinguish between the three kinds. The experiment of stipulating for home-grown meat was tried in the early years of the present century, and was abandoned in favour of home-killed meat mainly on account of this difficulty. And while the original proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture, put forward in 1929, contemplated insistence on home-fed meat, in the later form of the scheme, produced early in 1930, &quot;home-killed&quot; was substituted for &quot;home-fed,&quot; the Ministry having presumably become convinced of the impossibility of insisting on the latter. It may, therefore, be taken as admitted that all that can be stipulated is that the meat shall be home-killed.4. When fresh meat was purchased before the war, supplies consisted very largely of the produce of class (iii) above, and this would doubtless still be the case. As practically all imported cattle now come from the Irish Free State, it follows that a great part of the advantage of the scheme would be reaped by the Irish breeders and the middlemen in this country. So far as this proved to be the case, complete preference would, in effect, be given to Irish over other Dominion supplies. To a lesser degree, the same would apply in so far as the meat supplied fell under class (ii), i.e., animals imported for a few months&apos; fattening.5. Another very important consideration is the effect on Dominion sentiment of the adoption of this proposal. The Services are by far the largest purchasers of the best quality frozen beef, and any decision to stop the supply would undoubtedly inflict a most serious blow upon the Australian frozen meat trade. In the present depressed state of industry in Australia, the effects of such a blow might be especially grave. This aspect of the case was emphasized by those interested when the matter was last under discussion, and Lord Passtield drew the attention of the Cabinet to representations which he had received on the subject. It is, of course, possible that the gap in civilian supplies of fresh meat created by the demands of the troops would be filled by Australian frozen meat, and that the Australian trade would not suffer any permanent injury ; but it has been represented with some plausibility by the Imported Meat Trade Association (Australia and New Zealand Section) that for the ordinary consumer chilled meat is easier to handle, and therefore more popular, than frozen meat, and that the shortage would be made good not by Dominion frozen meat but by larger shipments of chilled meat from South America.6. If it were decided to make any concession of the kind proposed, the extent to which the substitution of fresh for frozen meat should be made would remain to be determined. It is suggested that its operation might well be limited to the period from October to March, when supplies of English cattle are most plentiful and the farmer has most difficulty in selling to advantage. Both the measure which the last Conservative Government intended to introduce, had they been again returned to power in May, 1929, and the scheme put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture under the Labour Government, were limited to this period. It is doubtful whether . there is any substantial demand from the farming industry for the change to be made during the other half of the year, when farmers have little difficulty in obtaining a good price for their meat ; and to swell the normal demand for fresh meat at this season by the requirements of the Services might easily raise prices to an inordinately high level. The extra cost of &quot;the proposal, so limited, would be reduced from  500,000 to about  200,000. A further method of minimising the extra cost would be to limit the issue of fresh meat to 4 days a week, as was the practice in the years before the war.
7. The extra cost to Army and Air Force Votes mentioned in the previous paragraphs refers only to the difference in cost between fresh meat and frozen meat.Other additional expenditure is also involved in the proposals.   The whole i organization of the meat  supply for the  Army  and the  Air  Force,  including buildings, cold storage plant and chambers, personnel for handling and distributing, personnel for inspecting, &amp;c, is based on the meat supply in peace and war being frozen beef and frozen mutton.At small stations such as Portsmouth, Dover, Edinburgh, home-killed meat could be obtained by local contract, but there is no organization existing whereby the identification of the meat supplied as home-killed can be assured.Certain larger stations, such as Bulford and Catterick, present grave difficulties, in that there is no large town near by where home-killed meat in sufficient quantities would be obtainable, and there are no lairages for cattle or abattoirs at Bulford or Catterick. Lairages and abattoirs in the Supply Depots at these large military stations and at some of the larger Air Force stations might have to be constructed. Provision would have to be made for the maintenance of the cold storage plant and special cold storage chambers which would be closed - if home-killed meat only were supplied. Courses of instruction in the inspection of home-killed meat would be required for Army and Air Force officers. All these measures would involve additional expenditure, but no firm estimate of cost can be given.II. Bread.8. Bread for the Army and Air Force is obtained by one of two methods : (1) at certain large stations (Aldershot, Catterick, Cranwell, &amp;c), the bread is made in Government bakeries from flour bought by the Department, and (2) at all other stations by contracts made with local bakers.9. As regards the second class of station, it would hardly be practicable to stipulate for anything different from the local trade product. Where, however, any flour has to be bought (for purposes other than bread-making) at these stations, alternative tenders are invited for &quot; National Mark &quot; and non-&quot; National Mark &quot; and the former is always taken unless any extra cost is involved in its purchase. The extra cost of taking it wherever offered would probably not be serious.10. As regards the first class of station, i.e., those where there are bakeries, National Mark flour is already taken for purposes other than bread-making. The quantity involved (about 1,650,000 lb. annually) is roughly one-tenth of the total requirements at these stations. For bread-making at these stations, at present, National Mark flour is not used. It is estimated that the additional annual cost of buying &quot; Plain &quot; National Mark flour for this purpose would at current prices amount to about  6,500 ; but this would not in any case be a practicable course, since it is understood that at most a limited percentage of this variety of flour can be used in bread-making if a suitable loaf is to be obtained. If only National Mark flour were used for baking bread, it would be necessary to purchase the special quality known as &quot; Yeoman,&quot; which, in the opinion of the Ministry of Agriculture, can be used for bread-making without admixture of flour made from imported wheat. The additional cost of this over present practice would (if the price of &quot; Yeoman &quot; flour did not go up) be about  10,000 a year ; but it is understood that the available supply of this class of flour is at present quite insufficient to meet Service requirements, and with only comparatively small supplies available any sudden increase in demand would no doubt cause a sharp rise in price. An experiment made with National Mark flour at Aidershot has shown that bread produced was inferior to that obtained from flour of the ordinary grade.11. It should be noted, in considering the advantage which the use of National Mark flour in Army and Air Force bakeries would confer on the home farmer, that the bread made in such bakeries represents only about one-eighth of 1 per cent, of the total consumption of the country.12. The recent decision of the Government that a quota of English flour shall be incorporated in all flour milled in this country would apply to all flour bought for the Services and presumably no further special contribution would be expected from the Services.
