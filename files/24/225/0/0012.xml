Papers Nos. 1067-B and 1072-B.   Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutesof the 253rd Meeting, Minute 9.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1067-B), and also a telegram from the Government of India (C.I.D. Paper No. 1072-B).THE PRIME MINISTER said he understood that during the discussions, of the draft of this Convention at Geneva a new stage was entered, and certain amendments were made in the text in its final form. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee considered the revised text in its final form, and had now recommended to the Committee of Imperial Defence that the United Kingdom should not sign this Convention. A telegram had also been received from India intimating that they saw grave risks in accepting this Convention.SIR GEORGE MILNE said he would like to emphasize that the Chiefs of Staff had always held the opinion that the United Kingdom Government ought not to sign this Treaty, and this opinion had never varied. At one time, however, the Chiefs of Staff had had to accept the position that the Government intended to sign this Convention, and therefore they had then done their best to minimise the danger to this country by suggesting certain amendments. He would also like to point out that this was the first time that the Chiefs of Staff had had an opportunity of stating that they did not recommend signature of this Treaty.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff raised rather grave political questions. From reports he had seen in the press, it was alleged that both the French and German Governments proposed to sign this Convention just before the opening of the Disarmament Conference. The Committee would realise that very serious political questions might be raised if the French and German Governments subscribed to this Convention and we did not. The Chiefs of Staff memorandum had reached the Foreign Office only a short time ago, and therefore it had not been possible to examine thoroughly the suggestions of the Chiefs of Staff, nor to reach any final conclusion in regard to the recommendation on the political aspect. He had also noted that certain of the objections raised dealt with questions of interpretation, and he felt it important to consult the Foreign Office Legal Advisers in regard to these objections. Taking all these matters into consideration, he would suggest, therefore, that no decision should be reached at the meeting to-day because of the gravity of the issues at stake.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the most suitable procedure would be to forward the report, with the observations of the Committee of Imperial Defence, to the Cabinet for their final decision.[6291-1]
SIR JOHN SIMON said he was strongly in favour of this procedure being adopted, but he wished to make it quite clear that the Foreign Office had not yet had sufficient time to consider the report and all its implications. He did emphasise, however, the serious nature of the whole question.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he would like the Foreign Office to consider the point that in all Treaties of this kind we were in rather a peculiar situation. This country was, he thought, in a different position from many other countries, particularly Continental ones; we were down to bed-rock as to the size of our forces, which meant that we had to depend more and more on mobility and ability to move our naval, military or air forces with the greatest rapidity from one place to another. This necessity hardly arose, certainly not with anything like the same force, in the case of Continental countries; it did not matter to them that they should have the most complete mobility at any moment. It seemed to him that there was a tendency for these Treaties to tie our hands in the early stages of any war, which might, in our particular position, prove fatal.Mr. te WATER, speaking in his capacity as an observer, said he would like to remark that there had been telegraphic correspondence between the Govern-ment of the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom Government on the jjolicy as regards the Model Treaty. As a result of these telegrams he had been instructed to attend the meetings at Geneva when this Treaty was under discussion. During these meetings at Geneva last year the Dominions had been in a position of some difficulty, in that the United Kingdom Government had had no definite policy, and, as a result, the Dominions had had to do the best they could without that previous consultation which generally took place. As a result he had made a statement saying that the Union Government were prepared to sign the Model Treaty, but they were not prepared to ratify it until a substantial measure of disarmament amongst the nations had been achieved, and that statement of his stood on record at Geneva.Mr. THOMAS said he would like to add something to what Mr. te Water had said, in order to make the position quite clear. Certain discussions had taken place with the Dominions before the Model Treaty was discussed at Geneva, and as a result of these discussions it had been found that opinion was divided. The Union of South Africa had held one view on the question and the Common-wealth of Australia and New Zealand had held other views, and the two latter Dominions had indicated that, in their opinion, signature of this Treaty might prevent the fleet going to their assistance. Since these discussions, however, further changes had been made in this Convention. He quite agreed with Sir George Milne that the Service Departments had never disguised the fact that they did not like this Treaty, and he understood that the further amendments made at Geneva had only tended to strengthen their opinion; he therefore thought it very important that these new factors should be taken into consideration.SIR THOMAS WILFORD said that, so far as New Zealand was concerned, they felt the great danger was that the mobility of the navy might be prejudiced in relation to any movements for purposes of defence in the Pacific, if this Model Treaty were signed. It was the opinion of his Government that under the terms of the Treaty the fact that the fleet, or a portion of the fleet, might move from the Atlantic to the Pacific might result in such movement being deemed an act of aggression. There was no proper definition of the meaning of &apos;&apos; aggression&apos;&apos; under this Model Treaty, which made it even more dangerous still, and it seemed to him that if the fleet executed some strategical movement for the express purpose of preventing war, they might, under the Treaty, be exposed to the charge of themselves making an aggressive movement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that obviously this was a matter of great importance, and the final word as to the policy of the United Kingdom Govern-ment must rest with the Cabinet. He suggested that the papers should be sent forward to the Cabinet, and that, in the meantime, the Foreign Office and other Departments should look into the matter further in case there were any additional points to be raised.
LORD HAILSHAM said that Sir John Simon had intimated that there were some difficulties as to interpretation, and if the Foreign Office proposed to ask their legal advisers for help in this matter, he thought the Cabinet should have the benefit of any information on these points.SIR JOHN SIMON quite agreed, and said that he was anxious not to delay the matter too long, and consequently would arrange to have the whole matter considered immediately.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was anxious that the Departments concerned should consider any points as quickly as possible.Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) To take note of the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the model Treaty, and the telegram from the Government of India, and to instruct the Secretary to forward these papers, together with the report of the discussion, to the Cabinet for final decision.(b) That the Departments concerned should consider this matter at an earlydate, and should arrange for any further points to be circulated for consideration by the Cabinet, including, if necessary, legal opinions in regard to any questions of interpretations raised.* * * * * . *     -2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 7, 1931.
IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1931.SECRET. Copy No.     581067-B.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 288.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MODEL  TREATY   TO  STRENGTHEN  THE  MEANS  of preventing WAR.(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 287.)Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.Introduction.1. AT its meeting held on Saturday, the 26th September, 1931, the Third Committee of the Assembly of the League of Nations approved the text of a draft General Convention* to improve the means of preventing war, and decided &quot; to open this Convention for signature by States Members of the League and by those non-member States to which the Council of the League shall have communicated a copy of the Convention for that purpose.&quot;2. The text of this Convention, in its final form, was communicated by the Foreign Office to the Service Departments, with the request that they would express their considered opinions on the draft, and would state whether they were prepared to recommend that the Treaty should be signed.3. We have examined carefully the final text of this Convention, and our considered opinions are set forth below.Short Historical Note.4. Before proceeding to a detailed scrutiny of the articles of the Convention, it may be of value if we set down briefly the history of this proposal.5. In 1928 the Committee of the League on Arbitration and Security produced the first draft of what was christened a &quot; Model Treaty &quot; to strengthen the means of preventing war. The use of the term &quot; Model &quot; being intended to indicate that it was a suitable form of bilateral treaty for use between Powers anxious and/or willing to provide some form of insurance against frontier incidents. .6. The attitude of the United Kingdom representative, at this stage, was to give his blessing to the proposal on its bilateral basis, while, at the same time, indicating that this country would in no circumstances sign such a treaty herself.7. In 1929, however, the policy of this country was changed, and the initiative was taken in proposing the conversion of this Model Treaty into a Convention of general application. In other words, an endeavour was made to create a further instrument to assist in the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In this decision the Defence Departments were not consulted and had no opportunity of expressing their views, although. they would have to bear considerable responsibility for the execution of the Treaty.* Enclosure to Appendix to this Memorandum.[6200] b
8. After a period of protracted discussions, during which the text of the General Convention was subjected to considerable alteration, the final treaty* has now been put forward to the various Governments for signature.9. It is true that in direct negotiations with Lord Cecil, and at a time when the Government had already announced their policy of converting the Treaty into a General Convention, the Chiefs of Staff gave a reluctant consent to the somewhat ambiguous provisions of the Treaty as it then was. In these circumstances we concentrated our attention on endeavouring to secure the modi-fication of such parts of the text as appeared to us to run counter to our national and imperial interests.10. In viewr, however, of the fact that further alterations of some substance have been made to the articles of this Convention since we last had it under review, we have thought it our duty to give the whole question our fullest consideration.General Observations.11. We have never disguised the fact that, from the point of view of the three Defence Services, we regard this General Convention with uneasiness. It has always appeared to us that, however well-intentioned, there v7as a definite risk that acceptance of its provisions might hamper us during a period of strained relations, or might prevent us from carrying out strategical movements undertaken solely for the protection of our vital interests in the different parts of the world.12. It dees not seem to us, on mature reflection, that this Convention can in any wray further our interests; though, as we have already stated, there is a possibility that it may endanger them. Notwithstanding our belief that the Convention is unsuitable of application to a nation with our diverse and world-wide interests, we do not dispute that, in the case of some other, and perhaps smaller Powers such as the Balkan States the conclusion of such a Convention may be useful and helpful. We wish to make this point lest it be thought that we condemn this instrument out-of-hancl.13. We give, in the succeeding paragraphs, a resume of the provisions in the Convention which arouse our misgivings. We would emphasize as a general observation that we are unfaA^ourably impressed by the rigidity of the procedure proposed in the Convention. In particular we see grave objections to the idea of accepting unconditionally, in advance, a procedure which we might find imprac-ticable should the occasion arise.Sjiecial Observations,Ya) Article 2.14.   Article 2 of the Convention reads as follows : &quot;//, in circumstances which, in the Council&apos;s opinion, do not create a state of war between the Powers at issue which are parties to the present Convention, the forces of one of those Powers enter the territory or territorial waters of the other, or a zone demilitarised vn virtue of international agree-ments, or fly over them, the Council may prescribe measures to ensure their evacuation by those forces. The High Contracting Parties undertake to carry out without delay the measures so prescribed without prejudice to the other powers vested in the Council under Article II of the Covenant.&quot;15. Originally the opening words of this Article began &quot; In the event of a threat of war,&quot; they have now been modified to read, &quot; If in circumstances which, in the Councils opinion, do not create a state of Avar between the Powers at issue, &amp;c,&quot; with the intention apparently of covering the rather indefinite situation which lies somewhere between a threat of war and war itself. Although this intention may be clear, these words might, under circumstances which we detail below, be capable of being given a much wider application.* See Appendix to this Paper.
16. It is conceivable that movements of ships already in the territorial waters of a country or reinforcements of ships, might be hampered in a way which is impossible to contemplate. For example, in China, where we possess, at present, certain Treaty Rights conceding the presence within China of His Majesty&apos;s Ships, movements of troops by naval vessels might be called in question; yet in the present state ofOluna (who is represented on the Council of the League) the removal or withdraw/aToTour forces might be disastrous to British interests, including even life and property. Occasions of this nature have arisen in the past (vide Nanking in 1927 and Wanshien), and will no doubt arise again in the future (e.g., in the Persian Gulf or in China). It must be realised that by signing this Treaty the British Government would be debarred from using forceable measures (not amounting to an act of war) for its own national ends. In this connexion it will be remembered that in recent years it has been necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Ships to seize the Custom Houses at Alexandria. It therefore appears to us inadvisable to make ourselves subject to restrictions which might embarrass us in the future.17. We maintain a garrison in Egypt, both military and air, the importance of which does not require emphasis. Egypt may herself become a party to this Convention. Under the wider interpretation of this article it seems to be conceivable that, in the event of strained relations between ourselves and Egypt, the Council could request us to withdraw our troops. And, further, if the strength of the forces which&quot;we maintain m this country is ultimately regularised by an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, it.seems equally possible that the Council might endeavour to prohibit the despatch of reinforcements above the strength permitted by the Treaty.18. Similar arguments apply to Iraq, especially if that country, as seems probable, secures admission to the League, although by the terms of our proposed Treaty no definite limit is placed on the maximum forces which we may maintain. The possibilities which we have mentioned have been enhanced by the redrafting of this article, not only as touching its application during a nebulous and undefined period, but, also, by the substitution of the word &quot; enter &apos;&apos; for the word &quot; invade &quot; in the first sentence.19. It will be seen, therefore, that we are apprehensive lest, under this Article, we should be precluded from taking perfectly legitimate action, often bearing no relation to war in its general sense, to defend our interests, our nationals or our property. And, although we do not believe that such is the intention of the Article, we cannot ignore the fact that, in certain instances of which we have given particular examples, the wider interpretation might be invoked, thus causing us acute embarrassment and lessening of prestige, if it did not cause us definite loss.Further, if we sign the Convention we shall lose the freedom of action that we safeguarded before adhering to the Briand-Kellogg Pact. On this occasion &apos;&apos; certain regions of the world the^welfarepand integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace&quot;and safeliy^were referred&quot; to, and it was pointed out that &quot;His Majesty s Government have been at pains to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their protec-tion against attack is to the British Commonwealth a measure of self-defence. It must be clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom accept the new Treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.&quot;-(b) Article 3.20.   Article 3 of the Convention states :  &quot;If the circumstances referred to in Article 2 have arisen, or if in the event of a threat of war special conditions, and in particular the possibilities of contact between the forces of the parties to the dispute render it necessary, the Council may fix lines which must not be passed, by their land, naval or air forces and, where necessary in order to avoid incidents, by their civil aircraft. The High Contracting Parties undertake to comply with the Council&apos;s recommendations in this matter.
The lines referred to in the previous paragraph shall, if possible, be fixed by agreement tvith the parties at issue.Failing such agreement, the Council shall fix the lines with the consent of the party whose forces are affected, provided always that this does not involve the withdrawal of the forces further back than the exterior lines of the defence organisations existing on the frontier of the High Contracting Parties concerned at the time when the Council of the League of Nations takes its decision, and that the lines do not involve the abandonment of any other work, position or line of communication essential to the security or the supplies of the party concerned.It shall, in every case, rest with the Council to determine the period within which the said lines shall be fixed under the conditions specified above.The High Contracting Parties further agree to give strict orders to the commanders of their forces, if the Council so recommends, to take all necessary precautions to avoid incidents.&quot;21. This Article deals with the question of the circumstances in which lines may be drawn by the Council and lays down the procedure to be followed.The Council is empowered to draw lines in circumstances &quot; which, in the Council&apos;s opinion, do not create a state of war,&quot; and, in the case of a &quot; threat of war,&quot; in order to prevent &quot;contact between the forces of the parties to the dispute.&quot; These are very wide terms of reference, and in relation to the provisions of the previous draft of the Treaty considerably extend the field of application.Further, the text of the Treaty, as previously adopted by the special Committee at Geneva, was so worded that the powers of the Council to draw lines could be held to be dependent upon a prior &quot; entry &quot; or invasion having taken place.  There is no such restriction in the present draft.The lines in question are to be fixed, in the first place, with the consent of the parties concerned, but, failing such agreement, it is proposed that they should be fixed with the consent of the party whose interests are affected; and, finally, it is laid down that it shall rest with the Council to determine the period within which the said lines &quot; shall be fixed.&quot;22. We observe, however, that the situation which might occur, if the party affected cannot agree within the time limit, is ignored and the question at once arises, can the Council fix lines without the consent of the party affected once the-time limit has expired ?  And if not what is to happen then ?23. But, even in the event of a minor dispute (e.g., with China over Hankow) it seems to us that the Council might wish to fix lines beyond which ships would have to retire, and that such action might prove unacceptable to us.24. Similar situations might arise in the event of a dispute between two Powers, where by reason of Treaty obligations or national interests, we might be unavoidably embroiled. In such a case it is conceivable that we might be prevented from sending reinforcements, or an attempt might be made to make us withdraw behind a line or to such a position as would be incompatible with our security.25.   Finally, we would emphasise  that the  general  principle of this. Convention (in contradistinction to the Covenant) is to take decisions without achieving unanimity, including the interested party, and that further it is con-ceivable that the refusal of any party to comply with the recommendations of the Council, however valid the grounds, might result in that party being dabbed the aggressor.[Note. That there may be a tendency for some Governments at least to adopt this view, is shown by the following passage which occurs in paragraph 18 (3) of League Document A.86,&apos;1931 V. The report of the First Committee to the Assembly on the proposed amendments to the Covenant.&quot; That the only practical way of improving the application of the system of sanctions consisted in adopting provisions analogous to the draft Convention for the development of methods for preventing war,.
under which the collective action would be started, not as a result of answering the difficult question as to who had violated the Covenant, but owing to the refusal of a party to comply with recommendations of the Council for the withdrawal of armed forces behind a determined line, or the cessation of hostilities !&quot;](c) Article 4.26. The Admiralty, on their part have consistently raised objections to the principle of Commissions of Inspjxjtkm, but have only been successful in pre-venting their application to navaTbases&quot;.Colour is lent to the general principle of the Admiralty objections by the recent experience of the dispute between China and Japan in Manchuria, when it will be recollected that the United Kingdom Government were placed in the position of having to disclaim at Tokio responsibility for the proposal that a commission of inspection should be constituted.(d) Article 9.&quot;The present Convention may not be interpreted as restricting the task or the powers of the Council of the League of Nations as laid down in the Covenant.Nor should it affect the right of free passage through the Suez Canal provided for in the Convention on the Free Navigation of the Suez Maritime Canal signed at Constantinople on the 29th October, 1888.&quot;27. The reservation regarding the preservation of the right of free passage through the Suez Canal, as provided for in a Convention dated the 19th October, 1888, was inserted on the initiative of the United Kingdom Delegation.28. It is understood that this Convention covers the right of unimpeded transit so far as Land Forces are concerned. Naturally, however, no mention is made of Air forces, because they did not then exist. Primd facie, it would appear that they are covered, but we raise the point in case there is any danger that it might be claimed that this Convention does not cover Air forces. &quot;We understand that this point was raised at Geneva/but that the discussion was inconclusive, and the matter appears to have been passed over. We would remark that it is essential that this right of unimpeded transit should be in no way restricted1. Otherwise we might be precluded from sending air reinforcements to Iraq or India by sea by the shortest route; and in time of emergency the delay caused by having to use the Cape route might have very serious consequences.Summary.29. We have set out, in some detail, those provisions of this Convention which seem to us liable to run counter to our national interests. As we have said already, we are not unsympathetic to the idea of a model bi-lateral Treaty because it is conceivable that it might have a limited, but none the less useful, purpose in preventing frontier incidents and helping to maintain the peace between States which are disposed to accept it.30. It is witn the proposal to extend this Convention to make it all-embracing that we find ourselves in disagreement, and our objections may be briefly summarised as follows :  (a) The unanimity rule applicable to all corresponding decisions under the Covenant has been abandoned, which makes it infinitely more difficult to accept this Convention without reservations. As it stands, a country is apparently expected to accept unconditional obligations, the reactions of which it is not possible to forecast. [6200] c
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 23, 1931.(b) Acceptance of this Convention might hamper movements of the Fleet or Air Forces, might prevent reinforcements being despatched, and might result in unforeseen difficulties with countries like Egypt or Iraq, with whom it is hoped to conclude treaties giving us special privileges for the maintenance and movement of our armed forces within or into their territories. Further, we should lose the freedom of action in certain regions that we safeguarded in the correspondence leading up to the Briand-Kellogg Pact.(c) The Article dealing with the conditions under which lines may be drawnby the Council, is definitely vague in one important respect. It is laid down that such lines should be fixed firstly, by agreement with the parties concerned; failing this, they should be fixed with the consent of the party whose interests are affected, and within a period which the Council have the right to fix. No provision is made, however, for the situation arising if the party affected cannot agree within the time limit. Should such a situation arise, it is conceivable that the Council might attempt to fix lines without the consent of any of the parties concerned, and we feel we could not possibly recommend the acceptance of any Treaty containing an article which might imply that, in many varying and undefined circumstances, the Council had the right arbitrarily to fix lines behind which the armed forces of a State would have to withdraw.31. Taking all these factors into consideration, therefore, and having regard to the world-wide commitments and responsibilities of the United Kingdom and the diverse interests for whose protection His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are responsible, we find ourselves unable to recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should commit themselves to a Convention which might result in the imposition of unacceptable and harmful conditions, and might further interfere with and impede the execution of legitimate action for the purpose of maintaining peace and safeguarding British interests.(Signed) G.

j^tributed to the Members oJ?he League, the Assembly and the Council.]Official No. : A. 77. 1931. IX.Geneva, September 24th, 1931.LEAGUE OF nations general CONVENTION TO IMPROVE THE MEANS OF PREVENTING WAR(Document A. 78. 1931. IX.)REPORT BY THE THIRD COMMITTEE TO THE ASSEMBLY.Rapporteur : M. de Madariaga (Spain).In proposing to the Assembly the adoption of the text of a General Convention vu improve the Means of preventing War, the Third Committee desires first of all to offer its thanks to the Special Committee appointed by the Council. This Committee, which was presided over by M. Politis, has greatly lightened the labours of the Assembly by making a very exhaustive study of the questions which had prevented the Committee on Arbitration and Security from establishing a single text.While the Third Committee has made certain amendments to the draft report prepared by the Special Committee, it has in no way departed from the essential principles on which that Committee had reached agreement.First of all, the Third Committee, like the Special Committee, would emphasise that the General Convention can in no way Umit the powers held by the Council under Article 11 of the Covenant. This Article has proved itself very valuable in practice. To facilitate its application, texts have been drawn up and approved by the organs of the League, more especially the report of the Committee of the Council dated March 15th, 1927, approved by the Assembly on September 26th, 1927, and by the Council on December 6th, 1927, the study by the Committee on Arbitration and Security on Article 11 of the Covenant, recommended to the Council by the Assembly on September 20th, 1928, and the CounciPs resolution of June 7th, 1928, regarding measures to be taken in the intervals between sessions of the Council.As, hoAvever, when a question is laid before it under Article 11 of the Covenant, the CounciPs decisions must be unanimous, it has seemed desirable to propose to the Governments the acceptance of new undertakings, whereby certain decisions might he taken without their votes counting for the purposes of unanimity when they were parties to a dispute and when the Council thought fit to recommend to them certain clearly specified conservatory measures.These measures may be of two kinds : Non-military (Article 1 of the Convention) and military (Articles 2 and 3).Provision is made for two classes of measures of a military nature :(1) Measures which, in circumstances that, in the CounciPs opinion, do not create a state of war between the Powers in question, are designed to secure the evacuation of the territory or territorial waters of one party or of a zone demilitarised in virtue of international agreements by the forces of the other party which may have entered that territory or may be flying over it in the course of a dispute (Article 2) ;(2) The fixing by the Council, if it thinks this necessary, of hues in the territory of the parties which must not be passed by the land, naval or air forces of the parties to the dispute and, where necessary in order to avoid incidents, by their civil aircraft (Article 3).The text adopted for Article 2 emphasises the fact that it refers to circumstances which, in the CounciPs opinion, do not create a state of war between the Powers in question. A Convention designed to prevent war cannot, after all, be applicable when war has broken out.   For that case, other measures and sanctions are provided by the Covenant.S. d. N. 1.825(F) 1.400(A) 9/31.- Imp. de la T. do G.
The question of the moment at which war actually breaks out may of course give rise to difficulties of a theoretical nature. It would not seem that any more satisfactory explanations can he given on this point than those furnished in the following passage from the report submitted by M. de Brouckere to the Committee of the Council in December 1926 1 which was recognised as a valuable guide in this important matter, but is not formally binding on the Committee.The Committee has further thought it desirable to specify that there shall be equivalent treatment for land, naval and air forces as regards both measures of the first class (evacuation) and measures of the second class (fixing of lines not to be passed by the troops). As States regard their territorial waters as part of their territory, those waters must be evacuated by any forces that may have entered them or may be flying over them, just as the territory itself must be evacuated.Certain doubts have been expressed as to the possibility of ensuring in practice equivalence of treatment as between air forces and the other forces, as regards measures of the first category, since the mobility of aircraft permits it very easily to fly back over foreign territory during or after evacuation.In this connection, the Committee desires to call attention to the last paragraph of Article 3, according to which the contracting parties agree to give strict orders to the commanders of their forces, if the Council so recommends, to take all necessary precautions to avoid incidents. It is obvious that the latter paragraph will enable the Council to recommend particularly that the order not to fly over the territory or territorial waters of one party should be given to the air forces of the other party. Moreover, any raids by aircraft would, like those by land or sea forces, if necessary be verified or reported to the Council by the Commissioners which it had sent to the spot in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.Measures of the second category   that is, the fixing by the Council of hnes which the forces and, as far as may be necessary, the civil aircraft must not pass   may be prescribed, if the circumstances contemplated in Article 2 have arisen, and after the Council has prescribed measures designed to ensure evacuation, or if, in the event of a threat of war, special conditions, particularly the possibility of contact between the forces, rendered it necessary. It is understood that the State whose territory has been invaded will not be required to withdraw its forces behind the lines fixed by the Council until that territory has been completely evacuated by the alien forces.The powers conferred on the Council by this article may be exercised without an invasion haA-ing taken place or after an invasion followed by an order for evacuation.The Committee agrees with the Special Committee in thinking that it is obviously impossible in a general convention to formulate provisions for all the special cases which may arise. The Council will fix, within the limits of the Convention, the conditions for carrying out the measures which it prescribes. It will recommend to the parties only useful and practicable measures. Moreover, as regards civil aircraft, each party has also the right, particularly in the event of a threat of war, to notify in accordance with the rules in force, that it prohibits flying over certain zones of its territory by foreign aircraft.Further, as regards the actual fixing of the lines which the forces must not pass, it is understood that if the Council, after endeavouring to fix these lines by common agreement with the parties to the dispute, has been obliged, faibng such an agreement, to fix them ^with the consent of the party whose forces are affected, this does not involve the AvTtnctrawal or. &quot;the forces furTihl^back than the exteriorTmes of the defence organisations existing on the frontier of  the parties  concerned  at the  time  when  the  council &quot; We must now return to our previous remarks concerning tho conditions which must ho fulfilled &quot;before a country can be regarded as having resorted to war. There is no need to dwell upon the case in which the aggressor State formally declares war. Apart from this eventuality, two conditions are necessary, as we said :&quot; (1) One country must have committed an act of war against another ;&quot; (2) The latter country must have admitted the existence of a state of war.&quot; Further, the second country must have justification for taking up this attitude.&quot; Every act of violence does not necessarily justify its victim in resorting to war. If a detachment of soldiers goes a few yards over tho frontier in a colony remote from any vital centre ; if the circumstances show quite clearly that the aggression was duo to an error on the part of some subaltern officer ; if tho central authorities of the &quot;aggressor State&apos; reprimand the subordinate concerned as soon as they are apprised of the facts; if they cause the invasion to cease, offer apologies and compensation and take steps to prevent any recurrence of such incidents   then it cannot be maintained that there has been an act of war and that the invaded country has reasonable grounds for mobilising its army and marching upon the enemy capital. Tho accident which has occurred has in no way released that country from the specific obligations laid down in Articles 12 and following. It could not be so released unless it were the victim of a flagrant aggression of such a serious character that it would obviously be dangerous not to retaliate at once.&quot; In short, to borrow the felicitous phrase used in tho Treaty of Locarno, &apos;tho country in question must he exercising the right of legitimate defence&apos;.&quot; Legitimate defence implies the adoption of measures proportionate to tho seriousness of tho attack and justified by the imminence of tho danger. If a country flagrantly exceeded theso limits, oven if it were affronted by some incident of little intrinsic importance, it would become, in actual fact, tho real aggressor and it would bo only fair that that country should be made the object of the sanctions provided for in Article 16 &quot; (see document A.14.1927, page 69).
of the League of Nations takes its decision, nor the abandonment of any other work, position or line of communication essential to the security or the supplies of the party concerned, the natural lines of defence and vital centres being included among &quot; the essential&quot; works, positions, or lines of communication.Such are the provisional measures of a military nature which the Council may, under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, prescribe for the parties concerned. Obviously, other measures might, in certain special cases, appear desirable. If so, it will be not in virtue of the Convention, but under the general powers which it derives from Article 11 of the Covenant that the Council will be able to prescribe them with the consent of the parties concerned.Certain delegations have recommended, in particular, the generalisation of the system of permanent demilitarised zones, but the Committee considers that such generalisation might be brought about by way of bilateral agreements, and not by a general convention.Other suggestions have been made with a view to facilitating the application, if necessary, of Article 3. The possibility has been considered of neighbouring States negotiating between themselves in advance the limits of the demilitarised zones which they agree to create in their territory in the event of a threat of war.The Polish delegation again defended in the Committee the point of view which it put forward in the Special Committee. It considers that, if the conservatory measures of a military character are restricted to those provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the latter will have little value, and the Polish delegation Avould, in particular, have liked to have the following clause included :&quot; In the event of the Councils deciding that an international obligation concerning the state of a High Contracting Party&apos;s armaments has been violated, it shall call upon the High Contracting Party to restore the situation in accordance with the said obligation. The High Contracting Parties undertake to comply with such hrvitation without delay&quot;.The Third Committee shared the opinion of the Special Committee that the question did not come within the scope of the Convention and the Polish delegation reserved its right to submit the matter to the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.The Third Committee unanimously accepted the text of Article 4 proposed by the Special Committee for the supervision of the execution of measures of a military character prescribed by the Council. It is understood that the task of the Commissioners appointed by the Council in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 will consist exclusively of verifying on the spot the withdrawal of forces prescribed by the Council under the conditions defined in Article 2 of the Convention. The Commissioners may not make a more extensive inspection than is necessary to verify the withdrawal of the forces, works or military establishments and in no case may they inspect naval or air bases.The Committee furthermore draws the Assembly&apos;s attention to the last paragraph of Article 4 under which the rules to be followed for the composition and working of commissions of inspection shall be embodied in executive regulations which shall be prepared by the competent organs of the League of Nations so as to enter into force at the same time as the Convention. The Assembly will certainly wish to draw the Councils attention to the expediency of giving the competent organs of the League the instructions necessary for these regulations to be ready in good time.As regards Article 5 concerning the question of penalties, the Third Committee succeeded in achieving unanimity, the Netherlands delegation having renounced the reservation which it had asked to have inserted in the Special Committee&apos;s report. It is understood that the second paragraph of Article 5 refers to the case of wars breaking out as a consequence of a violation, established by the Council, of the conservatory measures of a military character defined in Articles 2 and 3. As in all cases in which Avar breaks out, the Members of the League may, and, in fact, must, decide Avhether a State has resorted to Avar contrary to the obligations entered into under Articles 12, 13 or 15 of the CoA^lieutenant, before considering ipso facto that a Member of the League has committed an act of war against all the other Members. Furthermore, in the special case referred to in the second paragraph of Article 5 of the General Convention, the contracting parties Avill consider that the Adolation by another contracting party of the supplementary obhgations Avhich it has freely entered into under Articles 2 and 3 of this Convention constitutes prima -facie eAddence, if Avar breaks out, that the said party has resorted to war Avithin the meaning of Article 16 of the Covenant. It is understood that this is only prima facie eAddence, Avhich does not preclude proof to the contrary.The Committee inserted in Article 6 a clause under Avhich the parties to the Convention undertake to proAdde, by the means at their disposal, such publicity as the Council may think fit for its proceedings, decisions and recommendations Avhen a dispute is brought before it in the case contemplated by the Com^ention. For the application of this clause, Avhich is aimed at preventing public opinion as far as possible from receiving one-sided information and also at influencing on the public opinion of the countries im^olved Avith all the CounciPs moral authority, the Council must take a decision concurred in by all the Members Acting other than the parties to the dispute. Naturally, this clause, like the others, cannot affect the rights of the Council under the Covenant, and particularly its right to regard publication of its discussions, decisions and recommendations as a matter of procedure under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the CoA^lieutenant; but publicity only becomes compulsory under Article 6 of the Convention if it is decided upon unanimously.
The British delegation proposed the addition of a clause stipulating that it waT understood that the measures laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 2 should not affect the right of free passage through the Suez Canal provided for in the Convention on the Free Navigation of the Suez Canal signed at Constantinople on October 29th, 1888. To meet the British delegation^ wishes, the Committee inserted a second paragraph in Article 9 referring to this Convention.The formal clauses of the Convention do not call for much comment.It may, however, be well to draw attention to the fact that for the entry into force of the Convention as provided in Article 14, ten ratifications or accessions will be necessary. Moreover, the last paragraph of the said article gives each contracting party the right to accompany his ratification or accession by a reservation under which he makes the entry into force of the Convention, in so far as he is concerned, conditional on ratification or accession on behalf of certain countries named by him. It goes without saying that the ten ratifications or accessions necessary for the entry into force of the Convention must either be ratifications or accessions not accompanied by reservations, or ratifications or accessions accompanied by reservations but rendered final by the fact that the conditions laid down in the said reservations have been fulfilled.A proposal was put forward to insert a clause making the entry into force of the Convention conditional, apart from the number or ratifications or accessions provided for, on a declaration by the Council accepting the responsibilities laid upon it by the Convention. After consideration, it was thought that such a declaration was superfluous ; the Convention having to be approved by the Assembly, it was recognised that the Council would have to obey its provisions.It was also proposed to draw up the Convention in the form of an instrument open only to the accession of the parties on the model of the General Act. The Governments would only have been able to accede after obtaining the authorisation prescribed by the national constitutions.The Committee eventually decided on the system generally adopted for conventions concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations, because it recognised the force of the argument that it would be easier for Governments to affix their signatures before the Conference for the reduction and limitation of armaments than to obtain the necessary authorisation for accession before February 2nd, 1932, the date on which this Conference is to open. In signing the Convention, the Governments will assume a moral obligation, and it is highly desirable that a large number of them should assume this obligation before the Conference.In conclusion, the Committee wishes to recall the passage in the Special Committee&apos;s report in which the latter appraises the value of the draft which it drew up, and which has become, with a few amendments, the text of the present Convention.After stating that it realised perfectly well the limitations of the text it had prepared, the Committee explained that it did not seem possible to ask the States to accept more extensive obligations in a general convention, &quot; But &quot;, it added, &quot; whereas, in the matter of conservatory measures, the contracting parties Avill not be legally bound except by the obligations in the convention, there can be no doubt that they may, if they think fit, themselves agree or propose to the Council to take other measures &apos; that may be deemed Avise and effectual to safeguard the peace &apos; and &apos; the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends &apos;.&quot; Moreover, although the draft represents only a modest advance in the direction of the means of preventing war, the Committee desires to emphasise its practical importance and cherishes the hope that in the future this first step may be followed by other and more important steps. &quot;The Committee fully endorses the Special Committee&apos;s opinion, and associates itself with the hope thus expressed.I have accordingly the honour to submit the following draft resolution for the approval of the Assembly :&quot; The Assembly,&quot; (1) Taking note of the report submitted to it on behalf of the Third Committee ;&quot; (2) Thanking the Special Committee for the admirable work it has done towards the framing of the draft general Convention to improve the Means of preventing War :&quot; (3) Approves the text of the said Convention which has been drawn up by the Third Committee ;&quot; (4) Decides to open the Convention for signature by the States Members of the League and by those non-member States to which the Council of the League shall have communicated a copy of the Convention for that purpose ;&quot; (5) Earnestly trusts that a large number of States will sign the Convention before the opening of the forthcoming General Disarmament Conference ; and&quot; (6) Bequests the Council to make the necessary arrangements in good time for the preparation of the rules referred to in the last paragraph of Article 4, in order that, should circumstances so dictate, the Convention may be put into effect immediately \upon its entry into force &quot;.

JLesquels, apres avoir depose leurs pouvoirs trouves en bonne et due forme, sont convenus des dispositions suivantes :Article premier.Les Hautes Parties contractantes s&apos;engagent, pour le cas oil il s&apos;eleverait entre elles un differend dont le Conseil de la Societe des Nations serait saisi, a accepter et a mettre a execution les mesures conservatoires d&apos;ordre non militaire ayant trait a. 1&apos;objet meme du differend que le Conseil, agissant suivant les pouvoirs qu&apos;il tient du Pacte de la Societe des Nations, pourrait recommander en vue d&apos;empficher 1&apos;aggravation de ce differend.Le Conseil fixera la duree de ces mesures conservatoires. II pourra la prolonger si les circonstances le rendent necessaire.Article 2.Si, dans des circonstances qui, de 1&apos;avis du Conseil, ne creent pas l&apos;etat de guerre entre les Puissances en cause, parties a la presente Convention, les forces d&apos;une de ces Puissances ont penetre sur le territoire ou dans les eaux territoriales de 1&apos;autre, ou dans une zone demilitarisee en vertu d&apos;accords internationaux, ou les survolent, le Conseil peut prescrire des mesures pour en assurer ! evacuation par les dites forces. Les Hautes Parties contractantes s&apos;engagent a se con former sans retard aux mesures qui seront ainsi prescrites, sans prejudice des autres pouvoirs que le Conseil tient de 1&apos;article 11 du Pacte.Article 3.Si les circonstances visees a. 1&apos;article 2 se sont produites ou si, en cas de menace de guerre, les conditions particulieres, et, notamment, les possibilites de contact entre les forces des parties en cause le rendent necessaire, le Conseil pourra fixer des lignes qui ne devront pas etre depassees par les forces terrestres, navales ou aeriennes, ainsi que, en tant que besoin, pour eviter les incidents, par les aeronefs civils. Les Hautes Parties contractantes s&apos;engagent a se conformer aux recommandations du Conseil a ce sujet.Les lignes vis es a, 1&apos;alinea precedent seront fixees, si possible, d&apos;un commun accord avec les parties en cause.A defaut de pareil accord, le Conseil fixera ces lignes avec l&apos;assentiment de la partie dont les forces sont visees, etant entendu qu&apos;il n&apos;en resultera pas le retrait des forces en arriere des limites exterieures des organisations defensives existant aux frontieres des Hautes Parties contractantes interessees, au moment oil le Conseil de la Societe des Nations prend sa decision, et que ces lignes ne comporteront 1&apos;abandon d&apos;aucun autre ouvrage, position ou ligne de communication essentiels pour la securite ou le ravitaillement de la partie interessee.II appartiendra, en tout cas, au Conseil de determiner le delai dans lequel lesdites lignes seront fixees dans les conditions ci-dessus indiquees.Les Hautes Parties contractantes conviennent, enfin, de donner aux commandants de leurs forces, si le Conseil le leur recommande, 1&apos;ordre categorique de prendre toutes les precautions necessaires pour eviter des incidents.Article 4.Le Conseil designera, s&apos;il le juge utile, ou si une des parties en cause le demande avant que le Conseil ait pris une des decisions visees aux articles 2 et 3, des commissaires charges exclusivement de constater sur les lieux 1&apos;execution des mesures conservatoires d&apos;ordre militaire recommandees par le Conseil dans les conditions indiquees dans les articles 2 et 3.En reglant 1 execution des mesures qu&apos;il aura prescrites, il appartiendra au Conseil, sur la demande motivee d&apos;une Haute Partie contractante partie au differend, de faire coincider cette execution, autant qu&apos;il le jugera necessaire, avec 1&apos;arrivee des commissaires sur les lieux.Les Hautes Parties contractantes s&apos;engagent a accorder a ces commissaires toutes facilites pour l&apos;accomplissement de leur mission.Ces commissaires ne pourront proceder a. une inspection plus etendue qu&apos;il n&apos;est necessaire pour accomplir la mission definie dans le paragraphe premier. Ils ne pourront proceder non plus a aucune inspection d&apos;une base navale ou aerienne ni a. une inspection d&apos;ouvrages ou d&apos;etablissements militaires dans un but autre que la constatation du retrait des forces.Les regies a suivre pour la constitution et pour le fonctionnement des commissions de surveillance feront 1&apos;objet d&apos;un reglement d&apos;application qui sera prepare par les organismes competents de la Societe des Nations, de maniere a pouvoir entrer en vigueur en meme temps que la presente Convention.Article 5.Si une violation des mesures definies aux articles 2 et 3 est constatee par le Conseil et est maintenue en depit de ses injonctions, le Conseil avisera aux moyens de tous ordres afin d&apos;assurer 1&apos;execution de la presente Convention.Si la guerre delate a. la suite de cette violation, les Hautes Parties contractantes considereront ladite violation comme fournissant la presomption que la partie qui s&apos;en est rendue coupable a recouru a la guerre au sens de 1&apos;article 16 du Pacte.Article. 6.Les Hautes Parties contractantes s&apos;engagent a assurer par les moyens dont elles disposent la publicite que le Conseil croirait devoir faire de ses deliberations, decisions et recommandations, lorsqu&apos;il est saisi dans les hypotheses prevues dans la presente Convention.
Who, having deposited their full powers found in good and true form, have agreed as follows:Article i.The High Contracting Parties undertake, in the event of a dispute arising between them and being brought before the Council of the League of Nations, to accept and appiyilW&quot;conservatory measures of a non-military nature relating to the substance of the dispute which the Council, acting in accordance with the powers conferred upon it by the Covenant of the League of Nations, may recommend with a view to preventing the aggravation of the dispute.The Council shall fix the period of duration of these conservatory measures. It may extend this period should circumstances render it necessary.Article 2.If, in circumstances which, in the CounciTs opinion, do not create a state of war between the Powers at issue which are parties to the present Convention, the forces of one of those powers enter the territory or territorial waters of the other or a zone, demilitarised in virtue of international agreements, or fly over them, the Council may prescribe measures to ensure their evacuation by those forces. The High Contracting Parties undertake to carry out without delay the measures so prescribed without prejudice to the other powers vested in the Council under Article n of the Covenant.Article 3.If the circumstances referred to in Article 2 have arisen, or, if in the event of a threat of war special conditions, and in particular the possibilities of contact between the forces of the parties to the dispute render it necessary, the Council may fix lines which must not be passed by their land, naval or air forces and, where necessary in order to avoid incidents, by their civil aircraft. The High Contracting Parties undertake to comply with the CounciPsrecommendations in this matter.The lines referred to in the previous paragraph shall, if possible, be fixed by agreement with the parties at issue.Failing such agreement, the Council shall fix the lines with the consent of the party whose forces are affected, provided always that this does not involve the withdrawal of the forces further back than the exterior lines of the defence organisations existing on the frontier of the High Contracting Parties concerned at the time when the Council of the League of Nations takes its decision, and that the lines do not involve the abandonment of any other work, position or line of communication essential to the security or the supplies of the party concerned.It shall, in every case, rest with the Council to determine the period within which the said lines shall be fixed under the conditions specified above.The High Contracting Parties further agree to give strict orders to the commanders of their forces, if the Council so recommends, to take all necessary precautions to avoid incidents.Article 4.The Council shall, if it thinks fit, or if one of the parties at issue so requests before the Council has reached any of the decisions referred to in Articles 2 and 3, appoint commissioners for the sole purpose of verifying on the spot the execution of the conservatory measures of a military character recommended by the Council under the conditions specified in Articles 2 and 3.When regulating the execution of the measures it has prescribed, the Council shall, at the reasoned request of a High Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, cause that execution to coincide with the arrival of the commissioners on the spot, so far as it may think necessary.The High Contracting Parties undertake&quot;to&quot;afford these commissioners every facility for the performance of their duties.The commissioners may not make a more extensive inspection than is necessary to enable them to carry out the duty defined in paragraph I. Nor may they make any inspection of a naval or air base, nor may they inspect military works or establishments for any purpose other than to verify the withdrawal of the forces.The rules to be followed for the composition and working of commissions of inspection shall be embodied in executive regulations which shall be prepared by the competent organs of the League of Nations so as to enter into force at the same time as the present Convention.Article 5.If any violation of the measures defined in Articles 2 and 3 is noted by the Council and continues in spite of its injunctions, the Council shall consider what means of all kinds are necessary to ensure the execution of the present Convention.Should war break out as a consequence of this violation, such violation shall be regarded by the High Contracting Parties as prima facie evidence that the party guilty thereof has resorted to war within the meaning of Article 16 of the Covenant.Article 6.The High Contracting Parties undertake to provide, by the means at their disposal, such publicity as the Council may think fit for its proceedings, decisions and recommendations when a dispute is brought before it in the cases contemplated by the present Convention.

L. PEPYS, Colonel.Enclosure.Decyplier of Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, No. 2355 S, dated 20th September, 1931.Immediate.2355 S. Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to G. Dixon, Geneva.Your telegram of the 18th instant, 2735. While agreeing to principle of the Convention in its application to European countries, Government of India cannot ignore risk implicit in acceptance of unilateral liability vis-a-vis neighbouring countries, whether signatories of Convention or not. Acceptance on behalf of Government of IncTia imposes&quot;&quot;obligation to comply with orders of the Council, whereas neighbouring countries would either be under no such obligation or, if so, would not hesitate to ignore it if inconvenient. Attention is drawn to this aspect of the problem, not only in the interest of the Government of India, but also on account of reactions it may have on His Majesty&apos;s Governments liability for defence of India.[6255]
