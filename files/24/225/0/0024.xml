In paragraph. 24 (b)  (2) of their Report to theCabinet on the 23rd November last (CP. 288 (3l)), the Committee stated that their recommendations as to the articles ?,rhich appear to be most suitable for possible tariff concessions to the Dominions, would be embodied in a later Report to the Cabinet.2o The Committee have now examined two Reports from theInter-Departmental Committee mentioned in paragraph 9 of their previous Report,, and submit to the Cabinet the following definitive list of commodities likely to be of serious interest to the Dominions and suitable, in their opinion., for possible tariff concessions to the Dominions, provided that an adequate quid -pro quo is obtained.    The list of commodities would need further consideration in the event of suggestions being made for duties on other commodities.The second column of the table indicates possible rates of Duty suggested to the Committee, and the third column shows the Dominions principally concerned.

3. The Committee agree with the Inter-departmentalCommittee in excluding from consideration in this connection the following commodities -Dried and Condensed Milk,Eggs,Dead Poultry Bacon and Hams, Beef, Mutton and -Lamb.. Tinned meat,Live animals for food, .Maize.4. There remain certain commodities (Tea, Cocoa,. Coffee,Bananas-, Lemon and Lime Juice) which the Committee have also excluded from consideration.     In as much as they are tropical products in which Dominions are not interested they seem more suitable for direct discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer.) the Secretary of State for India, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Arrangements are being made for a detailed inquiry as regards sugar.5. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries concurs inthe above recommendations) but is strongly of opinion that no scheme of dutiea upon imported foodstuffs will prove satisfactory to home  agriculturists if Empire produce is inevery case to be exampted from such duties.    Ke emphasises that a scheme designed for the partial protection of home agriculture would afford opportunities for valuable con-cessions to Dominion produce by allowing such produce to come in at preferential rates.    The control - in one form or another - of the import of some of the commodities mentioned in paragraph 3 above, might be of substantial
importance in the development of home agriculture      Sir John Gilmour informed the Committee that the preparation of a tariff scheme for home agriculture will he taken in hand as soon as practicable by the Cabinet Committee on Agricultural Policyo6. The Committee have dealt with the commoditiesmentioned in paragraph 2 above on the basis that the produce of the Oversea Empire will be admitted to the United Kingdom free of Duty.     They conceive, however, that as a result of the examination referred to in paragraph 5 above, some of the commodities in question might come into a scheme -.-;f tariffr. for preference to the Empire on the alternative basis of lower tariffs than the foreign product would pay.     Tho Committee do net overlook the possibility of foreign tariffs themselves being on two scales, a lower scale for foreign countries entering into    Q a reciprocal arrangement with us, and a higher scale for the remaindero7. Accordingly, subject to the considerations mentioned,in paragraphs 2, 3 4 and 5 above, the Committee recommend the Cabinet -(a) To approve the list of commodities in the table in paragraph 2 above as commodities on which tariff concessions might be granted by the United- Kingdom to the Dominions in return for an adequate quid, pro quo on the part of the Dominions concerned.(b) To approve the general principle that tariff concessions to Dominions may in certain cii-curnstances, take the form not of free entry for a commodity into the United Kingdom, but of a rate of duty on
that commodity more favourable than the rate charged to any foreign country. In other words,  it may in certain events he appropriate to contemplate a tariff with three rates of duty, namely, the general rate, a most-favouxed-nation rate,  and an Empire preferential rateaSigned on behalf of the CommitteeCHAIKMA1I.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 15th December, 1931.5o
