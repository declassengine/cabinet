(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY CF HIS BRTTANNTO I6^TE6TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).CABINET.Secrete.COPY NO. Jf_C,P. 527,(51 ). *V/AT5RL00 BRIDGE,Memorandum by nthe Minister of TransportoThe physical condition of Waterloo Bridge is reported to me by the London County Council to be such as to necessitate an immediate decision as to its future, and in my judgement the importance of this bridge as a factor in metropolitan communications renders it imperative that action should be taken.It will be recollected that in the Autumn of 1923 a settlement was noticed in one of the piers and steps had to be taken to secure the temporary safety of the bridge, including the erection of a temporary bridge downstream to take the traffic in one direction.After obtaining expert advice as to the condition of the bridge, the London County Council decided at the end of 1925 to take steps to reconstruct the bridge with not more than five arches over the river and a width sufficient to take six lines of traffic.The position was brought to the notice of the Government of the time by the First Commissioner of Works (CP. 201 (25)) who pointed out that a proposal of this kind was objectionable to various architectural societies and bodies interested in London buildings, who desired to preserve &quot;Rennie&apos;s masterpiece&quot;.      The Royal Fine Art Commission had expressed themselves as in favour of Government intervention and the First Commissioner asked the Cabinet to decide whether the public interest in the preservation of Waterloo Bridge was sufficient to justify such a course.     The Cabinet then agreedHHnmnm
21) 3that the question fe]Jl..,en1^Lrely&apos;--within.-the- responsibility of the London County Council and that the public interest did not require that the Government should intervene.When the decision of the London County Council at the end of 1925 became known, the objections revived,     A conference of the various societies interested in the matter urged the Prime Minister to institute a public inquiry and in July 1926 a Royal Commission was appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Lee to investigate the whole question of London&apos;s cross-river traffic.The Royal Commission reported in favour of the provision of additional facilities for road traffic in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross and, on the assumption that such facilities would be provided, recommended that Waterloo Bridge should not be pulled down and rebuilt as a modern structure, but should be preserved,  subject to a proce;s of corbelling out on the up-river side so as to enable the bridge to carry four lines of traffic.     At present it accommodates effectively only three lines of traffic.      The precise method of thus adapting the bridge was left for future decision by competent authorities, but the Royal Commission took the view that, while any alteration in Rennie&apos;s design, was to be deplored, the alternative proposed could be so carried out as not seriously to impair its architectural effect - a conclusion which is open to doubtoOn the 16th March, -1927* Mr, Baldwin announced the Government&apos; s acceptance of the proposal to preserve Y/ater3.oo Bridge and acknowledged that the decision involved additional road facilities at Charing Cross.     The Government offered to the Council a grant from the Road Fund of 75 Per cent, of the approved cost of reconditioning the existing Waterloo Bridge, and invited the Council to join with them in appointing a committee of engineers to examine the scheme for a new road
bridge at Charing Cross^recommended by-&apos;i;he^ Royal CommJLaaioru. As a result of&quot; the report of the engineers the scheme for a double-decked road and rail bridge at Charing Cross was set aside in favour of a scheme under which the Southern Railway station would be removed to the south side of the river and a new road bridge constructed on the line of the existing railway bridgeoAfter prolonged investigations an official scheme, upon which Sir Edwin Lutyens acted as architectural adviser, was formulated.      To this the Government offered to contribute 75 per cent.     Negotiations with the Southern Railway were successfully concluded and the London County Council introduced the necessary Bill to authorise this proiect.The Bill came before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Cautley, in 1950 and was rejected by them.Thereupon the London County Council appointed a special committee,, on which the Government declined to be represented, under the chairmanship of Sir Leslie Scott,      This Committee reported in March last by a majority in favoiir of a scheme which embodied all the leading features of the official scheme, but intorduced certain improvements^The London County Council resolved to make application to Parliament in the session of 193V32 for powers to carry the revised scheme into effect, subject to the Government agreeing to contribute 75 Per cent, of the cost, estimated not to exceed twelve and a half millions.     The late Government decided that, as the scheme was still not an agreed one and as future events (such-as the electrification of main line railways) might affect the lay-out on the south side of the river and in view of the financial situation of the Road Fund and generally of the serious economic situation, they could not renew the offer of a 75 per cent, grant to the cost of a new bridge.
- it- -I do not think that-^he-decision.-, of the late Government which was generally accepted as inevitable, could have taken any other form, and the opportunity for effecting this great improvement of the traffic facilities and architectural amenities of the district around Charing Cross and Waterloo Station must, I fear, be regarded as lost for the next generation by the decision of the Select Committee in 19^0 ^d subsequent financial stringency.We have now to decide upon our attitude towards the proposal to reconstruct Waterloo Bridge.In the first place, I submit that this bridge, with certain of its arches shored up and an ugly temporary structure alongside it, cannot be left to become one of the more permanent features of the London landscape.      Apart from aesthetic considerations, the movement of road traffic at a walking pace causes grave inconvenience and the navigation of the Thames is seriously impeded.     It must be remembered, too, that in the most favourable event the present inconvenience must be endured for another 5 or if years, as even if a decision were reached today the work of construction would hardly be completed before 1955*In the next place, it cannot be disputed that in order to fit the bridge for traffic a heavy expenditure (over three-quarters of a million) will be involved, even if we are content with a four-line structure which might suffice for today but affords no margin, for the future expansion of metropolitan traffic.The Chairman of the Improvements Committee of the London County Council has informed me that the council is strongly in favour of building a new bridge to take six lines
of traffic.      It is true;  that the approaches on &quot;both sides of the river are at present such that a bridge reconstructed to these dimensions would not for some years to come be used to its full extent, but the London County Council have already-arranged to widen the northern approach to 85 ft. while on the southern side Waterloo Bridge Road at present measures 80 ft. in width for the greater part of its length and could be further widened when re-development occurs.It might also appear undesirable on traffic grounds, pending material street improvements and widenings in the neighbourhood of the intersection of Waterloo Bridge Road with the Strand, to add to traffic congestion at that point, though the recently-introduced traffic regulations in Aldwych have done something to mitigate this trouble.On the other hand, a new bridge would have a life of at least a century and financial prudence would suggest that, if any substantial expenditure is now to be incurred, the structure should be on a scale which will meet the future needs not only of road traffic but also of river traffic which is hampered by the narrow spans of the present structure.      I am the more impressed with this aspect of the matter when I reflect that the cost of a new six-line bridge is estimated to be about  1,300,000,  as compared with an estimated cost of S8o0,000 for reconditioning the present bridge on the lines proposed by the Royal ComiaiSBion.      (Both estimates are mere approximations).The London County Council are pressing me to indicate what the Government *s attitude would be to a definite proposal from them tst reconstruct the bridge for six lines of traffic and what rate of grant we should be prepared to promise to such a scheme.
I do not know irhetter the- Government would in any circumstances &quot;be prepared any longer to promise a 75 Pe1, oent. grant,  even to a scheme which preserved the existing bridge. If,  on grounds of policy irrespective of transport considerations the Government desired to exert all the pressure it could in favour of the preservation of the bridge,  it might conceivably do so by expressing willingness to make a grant of 75 Per cent, of the cost of such a scheme, while refusing to make any or only a lower grant to the cost of an alternative scheme.      This, however, would in my opinion be most unfair to the London County Council, and such a line of action would not conform with the general policy of making grants to the reconstruction of important classified bridges at the rate of at least 60 per cent, for a bridge of first -importance.     The alternatives would be to offer the same rate of grant to either scheme and the cost to the Road Fund would work out as follows :-(1) Preservation Scheme.Estimated cost.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;     **V*860,000.Of 5,ooo. 51 6,000. 1,300,000. 975,000. 780,000.Road Fund grant of Jffi. *&quot;     &quot;       &quot;       60/0..(2) Hew Modern Bridge ...Road Fund grant of 75^**&quot;       &quot; &quot;       ^JJLiThe question of the architectural value of waterloo bridge must be a matter of taste and opinion.      Undoubtedly weshall find almost all the architectural and antiquarian societiesof the country aligned in its defence, although individualarchitects of eminence may differ.     The question for decision is whether on this ground the Government is again to seek to deterthe London County Council, by direct intervention or strongfinancial pressure,  from removing the structure which, whatever its monumental interest, *&apos;const!tutes a handicap to transport byroad and river and can only be adapted to modern needs by
violating its - architecture -integrity-and.,at--a-cost of over three-quarters of a million.It might he practicable to conserve the stonework for use in constructing a replica of Waterloo Bridge over some other river,  just as parts of the former Hungerford Suspension Bridge are still in use across the Avon gorge at Olifton.     This possibility I should be prepared to suggest for exploration when the main issue has been decided.I should add thct the London County Council consider that they would require no Parliamentary powers to enable them to reconstruct the Bridge.To sum the matter up:    Formally, the correct and simple course is to leave the unfettered decision whether to reconstruct the existing bridge or. to build a new bridge on modern lines to the London County Council, which is the legally-constituted improvement authority for London.     Provided, of course, their plans for a new bridge were appropriate, the onus of aesthetic decision would then be left to thenw-Technically,  the right course must obviously &quot;he* when incurring so heavy an expenditure of public money to build a structure which will meet the needs of traffic for the next two or three generations.Financially, it might be considered unfair to discriminate in the terms which we should be prepared to offer to alternative schemes.     The London County Council are no doubt expecting the old rate of grant of Jffi to be maintained and if the Road Fund were affluent there would be much to be said for meeting their view.      I am, however, bound to recognise the grave financial position and should not feel able to object to a more restricted proposal to offer a rate of 6C0, which is the normal rate for improvement of a Class I bridgeGenerally,  I feel that it would not be fair for me to press the foregoing considerations too strongly upon the
2HCabinet until they have had an opportunity of discussing in its wider aspects a problem which is acutely controversial and has a long history behind it.(Intld) P. J. P.1 5th December, 19o1.
