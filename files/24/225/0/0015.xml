THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET..CP,   515  (3,1). COPY NO.C A B I N E T. BRITISH DEBT TO AMERICA. Memorandum, &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer..1.        My colleagues are aware that from the outset this country advocated the complete cancellation of inter-national monetary liabilities of a political character arising out of the war;    and that ? failing assent to this on the part of other creditor countries, we have scaled down the amounts due to us so as to limit our demands for Reparations end war Debts to the sum necessary to cover our annual War Debt payments to the United States. The British share of German Reparations under the Young Flan was calculated so as; with our Allied Debt receipts3 to provide us with this cover, and under the Hague Agree-ments cur annual, payments to America (about  33 millions a year up to and including 1932, and  3?i millions thereafter, at the old par of exchange) were so covered with a small annual surplus.      I wish to emphasise the fact that in adopting this principle (of the Balfour Note) Great Britain has already made an, immense sacrifice by foregoing to debtor countries a very large part of their obligations to us;    but even on this reduced basis we have so far paid to the United States approximately  200 millions (capital plus interest) more than we have received,.
1 ^ JL v D2. We are not faced with the prospect of &apos; a.. cessation of German Reparation payments and of a prohable cessation or reduction of payment on the Allied &apos;7ar Debts due to us (since those payments also ware in their turn covered by Gorman Reparation receipts) ana the question of&quot; the policy which in these circumstances we are to follow regarding our debt to America must be decided without delay. 50 Ma Laval has been to Washington and stated the French-case, and Signor Grandi has stated the Italian case      &apos;7e alone have remained silent,,      It is not likely that in any exchange of views with the United States Government we shall succeed in eliciting any definite statement of policy. Owing to the internal crisis and the impending presidential elections Mr. Hoover Is clearly in no mood to commit himself to a forward foreign policy.      It is true that events may at any moment force him to intervene, but it is impossible to calculate how and when these events will occur,      Meanwhile it is quite clear from the various statements made both in connection with M,,  Laval&apos;s visit and other occasions that the United States Government are resolved net to make any further contribution towards solving the economic crisis in Europe so long as they can possibly help ite      The most Mo  Laval appears to have &quot;been able to obtain towards such an assurance is that if germany&apos;s creditors make any concession to Germany in the matter of reparations, the United States Government will be prepared to make its contribution in due course0 4S Although, therefore, we are not likely to obtain anyconcrete statement of policy from the United States Government, the question remains whether we ought not to infern them in tlx. of the policy which circumstances will compel us to pursue in
the probable event of the drying up of our receipts from reparations and war debtsD      If Kis Majesty&apos;s Government should find it impossible to continue their payments to the United States in certain contingencies,  it would he far better that the United States should be warned in ample time of this possibility,,, rather than that they should be taken by surprise if and when the circumstances actually do arisea50 Moreover, in view of the present passive attitudeof the United States Government,  it will probably be found that the best, if not the only means of compelling them to enter into any fruitful discussions on the subject of war debts and reparations is by bringing them up against the possibility of non-payment by Kis Majesty&apos;s Government. Indeed, it has been argued that the attitude of American public opinion towards British war debts is somewhat as follows,      So long as a debtor punctually pays his debt there is no reason or inducement for a creditor to remit or reduce that debt, even if in his heart of hearts he considers the debt excessive or unjust^      In such cireum-stances the creditor expects his debtor to teJ.l him that he cannot or will not pay any longer,   in order that the question may be reopened, thereby providing the proper pro codure for making a more reasonable composition between creditor and debtor0      In a word, if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-lnent wish to have a reopening of the war debt settlement;., they must take the initiative of declaring their Inability to payf60 If the debt funding settlement can be reopened our requirements might be secured in one of two ways,, In the first place, the United States Government might take their courage in both hands and. accept Senator Borah&apos;s advice an agree to a total cancellation of War Debts, This of coure would be entirely In accordance with what has always been British policy /
1 ^i- CV 0&quot;but all our information goes to chew that the United States Government are not yet prepared to  take this  step^7,      Alternatively;,  the United States Government may find it easiers  in order to redress the injustice which has been done to this country in the past,  to call together again the Debt Funding Commission with instructions to review the capacity to pay of the United States&apos;  debtorso    If this wore dones  and our settlement were scaled down to conform with the terms of the  settlement of the French debt, to America,  this would,  according to our calculations, mean that,  if French payments to America continue   on the present scale, we should have to make no fur the?? payment on our hebt to the United States until December 1941;    for we have already paid far more  than we should have paid, had our debt been funded on the same terms and at the  same time as the French debt.    Should the French payments be reduced,  resumption of payment on our part wouldbe still further postponedo8.,      J5r* Stimson has to some extent paved the way for us to approach the problem on these lines by a conversation with the British Ambassador in Washington last September in which he said that &quot;the far more onerous funding terms which had been imposed on us as compared with other Allies was a legitimate causa of shameful regret to all right thinking Americans&apos;-a and that the United States Government had been examining the possibility of alleviating our v/ar Debt, but that it had appeared impracticable as an immediate and isolated measure,. As regards the ultimate aspect of debt revision, he said that pending the summoning of Congress there was nothing to be done. As regards the future of &quot;&apos;7ar Debts and Reparations,  the Adminisiration felt that it would be difficult to begin by revising :Var Debts,  as under the Balfour Note Great Britain -would pass on any benefit to others*
9c      The Foreign Office do not attach mugh weight, to this i. .*)&apos;&apos;  I     conversation, but a full telegram was sent to the Embassy atWashington saying that if any public indication of Mr.  Stimson&apos;s views were possible,  it would have a most reassuring effect on public opinion here.    It was explained that, while we have to pass on to Germany three-quarters of any concessions made to us by America, we should not have to remit any of our potential receipts from France etc:  in respect of \/ar Debts till we have made good the shortage up to date of our receipts on war debt and reparation account of nearly  200 millions as compared with our payments to the United StateSo    Sir Ronald Lindsay was informed that we should like to have any further indication which he could obtain as to the policy of the United States Government on the whole question, but he was instructed to exercise the utmost discretion; and,  as Mr. Stimson never recurred to the subject, we have received no further enlightenment on the American views.    It was of course somewhat difficult to pursue the matter far on the eve of the General Flection in this country, but the conversation referred to might now make it easier for Sir Ronald Lindsay to seek enlightenment as to the policy of the United States Government and to communicate to them definitely our own views..10.      President Hoover&apos;s one-year moratorium proposal is now coming before Congress and it is therefore desirable that the Ambassador should be in a position to state the policy of the British Government at once.    If Congress prove amenable,  the sooner the Ambassador approaches the American Administration the better.    On the other hand it is not at all impossible that Congress may press the President for assurances that he will not concede any further moratorium and it will then equally be necessary for Sir R* Lindsay to warn President Hoover that something must be arranged about our debt if a definite default is not to be forced on us.    V/e of course are very averse from anything that might be represented as repudiation; but It seems
to me urgent,  if we are to avoid such action, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should privately inform the United States Administration that in the present financial and political situation. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not in a position to pay in respect of their war debt to the United States of America more than they themselves are paid (within the limits of their self-denying ordinance of the Balfour Note) for reparations and war debts;    and I think it is desirable that,  if possible, Sir S0 Lindsay should go on to suggest that our case might be met, without creating any precedent, if the United States Government were prepared to reduce the terms of our funding settlement ex -post fag to to the same scale as tho terms accorded to Prance and relieve us of any further payment till such payment would be due on the French scale.0      It would be best to leave Sir S,c Lindsay discretion as to the extent to which he would develop this suggestion, which would have to depend on the attitude adopted towards him by the United States representative.(Initialled) NoCTreasury Chambers, S0?01.
