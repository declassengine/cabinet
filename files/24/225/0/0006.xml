The Bankers1  Clearing House. Lombard Street, London, E.G.  3c30th November,  1931.STRICTLY PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL,Sir,1. The Hepbers of the Joint Committee, representing theBritish Bankers&apos; Association and the Accepting Houses&apos; Committee, desire to &quot;bring &quot;before you certain important aspects of the. problem relating to the short-term debts due by German debtors under what is known as the Stand-still Agreement.I,2. WJien the Standstill Agreement was under negotiationa census was taken &quot;by the Joint Committee from all BritishtoBanks and Accepting Houses as/the amount of short-term German indebtedness due to them coming under the Agreement from which certain seasonal credits were excluded. Recently another such census has &quot;been taken from the same Institutions,,      The following Table gives, the comparative figures for acceptance credits and other forms of indebtedness, granted &quot;by the British Joint Stock Banks and Accepting Houses to Banking and non-Banking Dehtors on the two different datesi-BANK DEBTORSa 51/7/51 . 51/10/51Acceptances ....... ......   55,784,277c     31,015,305oGash and other forms of Indebtedness ............ .      9,346,108*        8,326,767* 45,130s385       39,342,072.

About half of the total of acceptance credits are&quot; &quot;... granted for financing the movement of goods, and the Sanies and Accepting Houses granting the credit either see the relative documents., or are provided with proof of shipmentc      The great proportion of the balance is stated by the Institutions making the return to be also of a self-liquidating char-actor ? though in this case there is no proof of the actual movement of goodscAs against the total amount of acceptance credits and other forms of indebtedness due to British Bankers and AccpetiDg Houses of  63,5375893    on July 31st 1931, and  55,213s361   on October 31st 1931, the Viggin-Layton Committee estimated the total short-term foreign indebted-ness of German Banks only at the middle of July to be about RoM,  5,o 1 milliards, (say 250 million gold pounds). They also estimated the total foreign short-term indebted-ness of Germany as a whole at July 31st at R,M. 7a&apos;4 milliard!: (say 370 million geld pounds)0      Since then the German authorities have, we understand, published revised figures estimating that the total foreign short-term indebtedness of all kinds was at July 31st 1931 R.M.12 milliards (say 600 million gold pounds)sThe Committee are unable to vouch for the accuracy of this last estimate which seems to them unduly high. In general, howeverv the figures serve to show:--lo    That out of the total foreignshort-term indebtedness of Germany there is a very large sum not covered by the Standstill Agreement entered Into by foreign Banking Institutions with German Deotors62o How large in character appear to be the sums lent, short by creditors of Germany other than Banking Institutions?- 2 -r
3.    How small a fraction of the total foreign short-term debt is re-presented by debts due to London Bankers and Accepting Houses.4.    How large a proportion of the debtdue to British -Bankers and Accepting Houses is represented by acceptance credits as against shortr-term cash deposits.In view of the widespread public misunderstanding which appears to exist as regards the action of the British Banking Institutions, the Committee desire to lay stress on certain aspects of this matter.The figures quoted in Paragraph 2    refer solely to deposits and credits of Banks and Accepting Houses-..   Ho other debts (e.g:.,, loans to States or Municipalities) are governed... ...   . .   ..   . .    . &apos; ... ...       ........   ...by the Standstill Agreement.The City of London has for many decades financed German-trade to a large extent by means of acceptances.    Before the War this was done partly by the acceptances of the big German Banks with their active Branches in London.    Since the War it has been done by the British Joint Stock Banks and-Accepting Houses.    There are no figures to show whether the amount of sterling acceptances for German account are larger now than before the War.    It is certain, at any rate, that before the&apos; War they were very considerable.The Committee    regard the amount of the acceptance credits as at July 31st 1931, quoted above as not excessive for London to have granted to a great country like Germany with a vast import and export trade.    It was a business that London had done on a large scale for many years with safety;  the credits were granted partly to the strongest banking institutions in Germany and partly to the best commercial firms with whom London had had
X V \J&quot;business connections over a long period.      The money thus provided was supplied for the purpose of conducting the essential impcrt and export trade of the country and not for any form of capital expenditure.     No exceptional profits of any kind were made out of such credits by the London Institu-tions..      Compensation for the risk taken consisted merely of the usual acceptance commission ranging from       to, say,. 2^ per annum) according to the credit of the credit-taker and the class of business transacted.9. London Institutions have,  indeed,  done nothing more thantransact their normal business with Germany which was essential for the smooth working of British and,  indeed, the world1s commerce.        Unfortunately,  circumstances have now put these credits into jeopardy.10... Owing to the acute shortage of working capital in Germanydue to the results of the &quot;ar, to Reparation payments and to inflation, non-Banking foreign money of all sorts has in the last few years been attracted towards Germany to be placed there for short periods in order to fill the vacuum.    &quot;&quot;hile it was clear that these additional short loans amounted to a large sum, the London Bankers had ns means of knowing how large it was. In fact, that knowledge was not even secured by the&quot;Iggin-Layton Committee and estimates of it have only recently been published by the German Government.    It is clear now that the total foreign short-term indebtedness had become dangerous-ly high. The great proportion of the acceptance credits was already current when the lenders were protected by the transfer clauses of the Bawes Flan,    But had the London Bankers determined, say,  in 1929, when the Young Plan came into effect, to sever all their connections of many years&apos; standing with
their German credit-takers and to withdraw credit facilities from Germany,  such action would not have saved the position-hut would have been the signal for general withdrawal of credit by other countries and thus precipitated a crisis.11. In fact, however, the London Bankers had no    more reasonin the beginning of 1929 to anticipate the extraordinary depression that lias since overwhelmed the world than had the experts who drew up the Young Plan.      The Young CommitteeTs Report contains, in the clearest words, thoir deliberate opinion - after a survey of the whole German situation -that in fixing the non-postponable annuities they had adopted a figure so far within the point at which difficulties could arise as    &quot;to remove every possibility of risk of error,,&quot; (see Paragraph 8,   (c)   on page 23 of that Report).12. It was,  in fact, the unparalleled world crisis which has so quickly developed, soupled with GermanyTe Reparation obligations and abnormal non-banking short indebtedness, which has jeopardised the normal banking credits granted by the London Banks and Accepting Houses to their regular German client s.13. These combined circumstances have produced a situation inthe London Money Market unprecedented in time of peace.    That Market has,  broadly speaking, worked without exception smoothly on the present lines for several generations.      Tho business of accepting and discounting bills is to-day being conducted in London on the same lines as it always has been and, we believe, with the same prudence]    but the unparalleled developments in the outside world have threatened for the first and only time, except at the outbreak of &apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;ar in 1914, to cause serious difficulties in the London Money Market.
10 P14. The German Standstill Agreement arose out of therequest of the    Seven Powers Conference, which met in London in July,  1931, that concerted measures should be taken by the Banking Institutions in the different countries &quot;with a view to maintaining the volume of the credits they had already extended to Germany&quot;.      In making this request the Seven Governments declared formally that &quot;in order to ensure the maintenance of the financial stability of Germany - which is essential in the interests of the whole world - they were ready to co-operate so far as lies within their power to restore confidence&quot; and they further declared that they locked forward to &quot;more permanent action to follow&quot;.      The British Bankers accepted in good faith - particularly in view of the recent declaration of the Hoover Moratorium - these declarations as evidence that the situation would be dealt with in such a manner as would restore the world confidence in German financial stability.        They did not at the time ask for further assurances or security from the British Government but contented themselves with stating in their reply that they would do their best to carry out the recommendations of the Conference &quot;in the confident anticipation that the more permanent action on the part of the Governments concerned foreshadowed by the Conference will be determined upon at an early date.&quot;     Since then nothing has been done by the Governments except to appoint  (following on the Conference^ resolution to this effect) the ^iggin-Layton Committee and to receive its Report.    That Report, which gives an admirable summary of the situation urged on the Gov-ernment immediate action and expressed the view that it was essential that before the period of prolongation of creditsrecommended    /
by the London Conference., comes to an end,  the Governments should give to the world &quot;the assurance that international political relations are established on the basis of mutual confidence which is the sine qua non of economic recovery, and that the international payments to be made by Germany will not be such as to imperil the maintenance of her financial stability.&quot;The Bankers, on their part, have faithfully fulfilled their undertaking, but the risks they have run in agreeing to maintain the volume of their short credits are more fully apparent now that the size of the short-term debts of Germany, not coming under the Standstill Agreement;, has been made known to the world.      By standing stil3. the Bankers have given to German creditors of German firms, to other foreign short-term creditors ana also to foreign holders of German securities, none of whom are bound by such Agreement, freedom to obtain repayment in priority to themselves^The Committee, indeed, believes that for various reasons, and even apart from political demands on Germany,  the situation of the Bankers under a Standstill Agreement    is like-ly still further to deteriorate^      If the Hoover Moratorium were to lapse and further Reparation demands to be made on Germany in her present financial situation, this tendency will, of course, be very seriously intensified.The Governments have now taken the further step of se-curing the summoning of the Advisory Committee under the Young Flan,  together with a Conference of the Governments to follow it, at which - according to the public press and without any word of fulfilling the declarations of the London Conference - full payment&apos; of non-postpenable annuities on at least an
1QAequality with all commercial dehts will be demanded by the French Government.17. The Committee have no intention of entering into thelegal aspect of &quot;priority&quot;.      They are not,  indeed, ar/are how the question of priority can be legally determined between a private debt due by a solvent German debtor to a foreign creditor and a Government debt due by the German Government to a foreign Government, except in the sense that the German Government might under irresistible pressure from other Govern-ments commandeer all available exchange and so prevent a sol-vent German debtor from meeting his obligations in foreign currency aThe Committee take their stand firmly on the ground that if the Governments concerned intend to &quot;restore confidence in the stability of Germany&quot; there can be no question but that any agreement between them must be&apos;such as to secure that the -exchange resources of German nationals are available in the first place to meet the short-dated and long-dated German obligations to foreign private institutions and individuals. Apart from the fact that the payment of Reparations already made in the past few years would have been impossible If the foreign loans short and long made to Germany had not been available, the whole process of international credit giving, which is essential for the economic life of all Nations,  de-pends on an assurance that there will not be any arbitrary restrictions imposed upon the necessary exchange transactions by or at the instance of Government debtors or creditors,,      If commercial claims are to be postponed to political debts, then undoubtedly private creditors will not only continue by all means available to withdraw-aw their money from Germany, but will undoubtedly refuse to give any fresh credit.      The result must be disastrous to the whole world and incidentally fatal to any hope of further Reparations payments being available.- 8 -
The Committee need hardly point out the exceptional dis-advantage in -which in such circumstances &quot;Standstill&quot; creditors -would &quot;be placed as against those who would he free through whatever channel they might discover to withdraw their money from Germany.In so far as a German debtor is unable to pay through insolvency or inability to provide Marks,  the creditor must take the risk, hut if to meet political difficulties private financial institutions are asked to continue to &quot;stand still&quot; then the Governments responsible for making such a request must he prepared, -in the Committee&apos;s opinion,to stand behind their nationals.      Tore Reparations and Inter-Allied debts to be entirely cancelled or indefinitely postponed, as it was not unreasonable to suppose might have been the outcome of the Hoover Moratorium, the creditors of Germany could, the Commlt-tee believe, have found without very great difficulty a gradual solution of her problem of repayment.His Majesty*s Government are aware from the Committee&apos;s letter of July 30th that the Joint Committee consider- such cancellation or long postponement as vital to the world&apos;s recovery.The Committee would stress the fact that under the Dawes Plan the Transfer Committee&apos;s duty was to transfer into foreign currencies only such Reparation payments as could be so transferred &quot;without threatening the stability of the German currency&quot;.      Under the Young Plan this limitation was omitted,, for the obvious reason that the experts assumed that no diffi-r. culty of transfer could ever arise as regards the non-post-ponable payments because of their reduced amount.      But the world crisis has quickly falsified this assumption and the transfer difficulty has emerged again in full force.
It is evident that, had the Banks merely regarded in July last their own interests, they would have demanded definite assurances from the parties to the London Con-ference before concluding the Standstill agreement Particularly, however, in view of President Hoover&apos;s Mora-sanatorium as well as the declarations of the Conference, the Committee felt confident, as stated above, that the Repara--tions and Inter-Allied debts were at last to be finally disposed of in some manner which would allow the interna-tional financial world freedom to set to work to restore the fabric of credit,,      The succeeding months of inaction and the preliminaries to the forthcoming negotiations have -destroyed that confidence and convinced the Committee that the interests of the private creditors, instead of being protected by their having carried out loyally the requests of the London Conference ares on the contrary, in greater danger,,      If they are, indeed, not only to see the claims of other creditors preferred to theirs but to be sacrificed to political exigencies as well, the consequence on the whole international financial structure and on the London Market in particular may he disastrous,,It must be evident, therefore, that it would he exceed-ingly difficult successfully to negotiate the continuance of the Standstill Agreement unless His Majesty&apos;s Government pro.-&apos;de adequate safeguards against the dangers referred to in this letter.As negotiations in connection with the Standstill Agree-ment are taking place at an early date the Committee would be glad if you would lay these views before.
