: ..     ..M-IV.-I&apos;. :!::.-MTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.\  511(51).COPY NO,CABINETjTCABINET POLICY AITD ?ORKv1Memorandum &quot;by the Prime Minister.Before Ministers disperse for a Christmas hreamgtime- I should like to direct the mind of the Cabinet to the wider matters of policy with which we must deal. 1;    I set up, a little time before the Labour Government came to an end, a Cabinet Committee on trade, the purpose of which was to consider and report upon, with recommendations to the Cabinet,, some of the most vital movements in our Industry, They were to turn their attention less to the day-to-day difficulties of this industry and that, and more to the general trend of industrial affairs in view pf the new conditions of both the foreign and the home markets.      The  crisis came before the work was finished,,      Such a survey is still necessary, but recent events have changed the form of our work,2;    The characteristic feature of systematising trade policyis that, whilst its component sections belong to Departmentsj these Departments ought to be guided by a general scheme in the background.      Only in this way can a national policy be pursued,      A hand-to-mouth Departmental policy may notonly lead us into very awkward /r. 1 -
i (j ^corners in domestic administration, but equally awkward ones in foreign relations.3  : During the next two months,  the Cabinet must try and devise a wide and co-ordinated policy on the issues upon which the election was fought, and must see that the various Depsrt-ments concerned are working with knowledge and in harmony. I am well aware that in this task there are grave dangers of serious disagreement, but I hope that all my colleagues will keep firmly in their minds the nature of the national appeal and verdict, and the serious effect on national interests of insoluble differences.4 ; These are the main problems which v;e have to face  .(a) Currency policy; This not only includes the question, of sterling value, internal and external, but also the composition of the Bank of England Directorate,  so that it may respond in its outlook to the most up-to-date ideas of the relation between banking and industry and all that it involves.    The idea is very widespreadthat this country has been following banking conceptions which arose from industrial and financial conditions which no longer exist,  and that we have suffered in consequence.    The Treasury is primarily and mainly interested,, but the Board of Trade is also involved,.(b) A British policy regarding international financial operations,  e.g.  debts,  reparations (both in cash and in kind)  including the Balfour Note, etc.- Here the Treasury,  the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office are involved, and it is necessary to keep in touch with Washington and exchange views.    So soon aswe have the report of the &quot;Young Committee&quot; now sitting,  there must be no delay/
in considering what we are to do regarding the next stage  which is a meeting of GovernmentscFiscal policy;-In my own opinion, which I stated mostemphatically several times during the election, the experience of States which have followed protection as conceived by the national school of economists like Carey in America and id.sat in Germany dealt with conditions which no longer exist.      The problem of how to protect the industry and the markets of a state from all competition which, for one reason or another, must be regarded as inimical to both its industrial and political good health, belongs in its present features to this generation and to the peculiar conditions of the world to-day.      To us it3 immediate concerns are such very urgent matters as the balance of our own trade, Empire mutual co-operation in relation to our political andeconomic relations to the rest of the world, development of resources that have been neglected,  or that,  in relation to outside competition, nay or may not be below the line,  or just on the margin,  of productiveto our general policy of economy and, I thin]--, must over-ride it at some points, as expenditure is necessary to give effect to it.      For instance^ I doubt the economy of a refusal to help small holdings and allotment societies. Some of the savings in unemployment payments ought to be devoted to this.       Here the Board of Trade,use,etc,This concern must be studied in relation
In nthe Dominions Office, the Ministry of Agriculture are primarily &quot;but not solely concerned,,Sconomy and Taxation; --     Although it was necessary a month or two ago to do something rapid and decisive,i think none of us are quite happy of the possibleresults of some of the things which we were compelled to do, and wore fully justified in doing at the time,.        But I think, now that these things are done, their effects should he reviewed and adjustments made in the general interests of the country.      Have we not in some directions reduced efficiency and well-he inf.: by the imposed economies, and still more by the general psychology of saving which followed upon our action ?      Is not taxation not only oppressively heavy, but is it always wisely imposed. ?      Are we not, by our present methods of taxation;,  actually drawing every year huge sums from our capitals either in cash or in culture, and using them as income ? Here the Treasury is primarily concerned, but every Department, from the Ministry of Health with its social service control to the Hone Office with its law and order resjonsibilities, on to the Ministry of Labour with its Unemployment Registers, are intimately concerned,  and a mutually helpful policy should be devised.      Whilst we remain together we have an opportunity which will probably not occur again for generations to get o national view and a national policy on these subjects which, unless dealt with systematically, will
In order to concentrate the examination of these subjects by the Cabinet,  I make the following suggestions as to how they are to be dealt with. I think it would help to clarify the issues If we had provided for us the result of an expert examination of each of these problems which would be the basis of consideration and conclusion by ourselves. This could be dona in one of two ways,  or perhaps both ways together :-(a.)    an examination by small bodies of inter-depart-mental officials;(b)    an examination by one or two experts who could be asked by me to give me advice.The latter I have extensively used during the last two years and the result has been most valuable. The departmental mind, although admirably expert within Whitehall conditions,  is not always fully alive to outside feeling and administrative reactions on social and business life.      The danger to be guarded against  (and I think this has been done throughout)  is that these Committees should be allowed to assume executive functions.The Cabinet should, therefore,  decide before Itcontinue to weaken our national position   .and baffle the purposes of our separate Depart-nients.      I propose before the Cabinet Meetings are suspended for Christmas to have a general discussion upon this; and at its close to suggest that action should be taken to deal with those subjects.      Each subject would require a treatment of its own,
disperses how the examination of these quest inns is to be conducted,  and the machinery agreed upon should be set up before we disperse.As regards 4(a):        there is the existing contact between the Treasury and the Bank of England, but in view of our present problems and for the purpose of dealing with them, that contact might be made more formal and specific.      No outsider should be consulted.        It should be confined to the Treasury, ^the Board of Tradey and the Bank&quot;        of England.      The three heads should meet,  first of all,  and discuss the matter,  and when they have come to tentative conclusions which could be brought before- the Cabinet;  they could consult with me as to how the consultation should take place, and upon what.As regards 4(b) :    Instantly the  &apos;Toung CommitteeTs&quot;report is available,  the Ministers or Departmental officials instructed by them should meet and prepare a memorandum for very secret circulation to the Cabinet,      When that, memorandum is in my hands,  I could decide,  in consultation with the Ministers, what to do with it.      The Report,  according to my information, will probably be ready before Christmas, and it may -ohen be necessary for the Ministers ccn-cerned to spend a day with me in London or in another place,  if that were more suitable to all of us. Upon this,  immediate action will have to be taken, because we cannot make ourselves responsible for any delay in calling the Conference of Governments.
Ministers will also have to he ready to confer together, lest important political changes affecting the situation should take place in Germany in the intervaleAs regards 4  (c): This is to present us with the greatestdifficulties of cur cc-operation0      It is not to &quot;be so urgent as the others, but means of coming to an agreement will have to be set going so that before we meet Parliament we may know where we  stand0The following big issues are involved:(a;  &apos;Vhat are the facts of the balance of trade?(b) &quot;tvhat are the national and international II interests which have to be accomodated in whatever scheme may be finally devised?This question indeed amounts to an examination of what is the nationals imperial and international problems M        and aims of British industry.(c) Y/e cannot be blind to the fact that, underlying and, perhaps5 dominating this problem is the political one of how far can the Parties represented, on the Cabinet agree on a common policyHow is this to be handled?As regards facts - I think we might make use of expert advisers sitting in conference with expert representatives of the Departments concerned.    In the pigeon-holes of the Economic Advisory Councils there is ample information regarding the problems of our trade, ana I propose to ask Mr. H,D? Henderson, who conducts the activities of the Council s to supply me with a memorandum on these facts.As regards the balance of trade - we should ask the Board of Trade to give us a memorandum embodying the very latest figures and opinions as to how we now s tand and as to the direction of rnovfextehtsv  &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;   &apos;&quot;
Ao regards the policy to he adopted by the Cabinet in order to meet the situation -we should set up a Cabinet Committee to deal with those :aemcrJna*S7*&quot;^n*e*T!61^r:irree consisting of the&quot; Chancellor of the Exchequer and. the President of the Board of Trader  the Minister of Health (on account of his financial experience)s and the rx-Chaucellcr (the. Lord Privy Seal)-,The political aspect of this work sgould be considered by the Lord Presidents  the foreign /m Secretary, the &quot;Home Secretary and myself.-.      We should come into action when the*rrork of the other Committees has reached a stags when something of definite political importance arises0The loss immediately urgent work   mentioned in 4(c)  can be dealt with a little later on-,The issues included in this section are partly day-to-day issues, but departments concerned in them should keep a vigilanS eye upon movements lest the Government may find Itself involved in very serious cons equeu cos 0Mr* Baldwin did a great service in Aberdeen in calling attention to the uneconomical use of economics, but i think it will be worth whilej in view cf %-fHat is p;oing on, if en authoritative statement could be madot with Cabinet sanetic upon this subjects      It would save us much unnecessary unemployment for which we have to pay either In cash or in unnecessaryblame and unpopularity0
Ac a greater part of these tilings are very-urgent , not only because events are passing-fast , hut because so soon as we meet Parliament we shall have to say something about general policy, I am afraid that it means that even if Ministers can leave London, they will hardly be able to have a respite from work, and must be on call at the end of a telephone.      They must, therefore, leave behind them a note of their whereabouts, almost from day to day with, if possible, their telephone numbers.We must also, before we meet Parliament, decide upon the legislative programme of the Session.. There are some Bills which, in the national interests, ought to go through.      They are not agreed in ever3^ particular, but their need is generally recognised.      We must, therefore, decide what they are and negotiations must be set cn foot or continued, in order to remove from them provisions which may reasonably be regarded as contentious.In addition to the international conferences which must be held in connection with economic conditions of the world, there is the Disarmament Conference which meets in February. The Foreign Secretary, hoy/ever, has that well in hand, but Cabinet decisions will have to be taken regarding it without delay.      The Cabinet will decide the date of the meeting of Parliament, but I would beg of all my colleaguesk 9 %
to be stiff in resisting pressure to extend, legislative programmes and to commit ourselves to action which has net been considered and which, though superficially attractive, may be not only troublesome but injurious in their consequences and after-effects.      Above all, I would warn them that under present conditions it Is the easiest thing in the world to start class conflicts in the country which could be avoided by discreet handling and language. /( Intld. )    J,R.M&apos;.0, Downing StreDecember 7th,  1931.
