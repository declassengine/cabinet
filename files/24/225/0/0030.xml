STATE OF TRADE - NOVEMBER. note by the President of the Board cf Trade.I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the state of trade in November.W.R.Beard of Trade,22nd December, 1931.
&amp; o aSTATE OP TRADE - NOVEMBER. 1931.(Summary of reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council).At a time when a rise in unemployment is to be expected from seasonal causes, there was instead real improvement in employment during the month in a number of the important industries including most textiles, coal-mining and general engineering.     There was, however, a seasonal decline in the building and contracting industries so that the total figures show that the improvement was confined to women (93,500) and juveniles (11,000), the number of men on the registers having increased by 15,700.     Between the 2nd and 30th November unemployment thus fell by 89,000 of wuich 74,000 was in the number of wholly unemployed.     The improvement was most marked in the North of England.In the coal industry although thore was continued improvement in employment during November, home markets remained on a low level apart from certain special coals.     The Central Council has fixed the allocation for the first quarter of next year considerably above that fixed or reached during the same quarter of this year in the hope of an expansion in exports resulting from the abandonment of the gold standard.     The improvement in October appears, however, to have been mainly temporary and at present the exchange advantage in export markets is largely lost owing to counter measures taken both by competitors and by consuming countries and by the uncertainties of the exchange situation.     .;ilven during October coal shipments to countries which had also abandoned the gold standard fell by 9.2$ compared with 1930, whereas shipments to countries whose currency remained on a gold basis declined by 20.9$.For November coal exports were somewhat below those for October and for the first 11 months of 1931 only 39,122,000 tons
as compared with 50,632,504 tons in the same period of 1930 a fall of 23$ while output over approximately the same period, I.e. to November 21st, was only 10*  down.The falling off in railway traffic receipts which was considerably higher in November than in October, and even a little higher than the average decline for the eleven months was due largely to poor coal traffic, which showed for the four weeks a decrease of 16 per cent, compared with 1950.   Merchandise-traffic receipts decreased by only 5.5 per cent, for the four weeks, compared with 10.9 per cent, over the eleven months. Freight tonnage for the three main goods carrying railways for November showed a drop of only 4.2 per cent, in the higher classes of merchandise, but in other classes 12.5 per cent, and in coal and coke also 12.5 per cent.Foreign competition remains the dominating factor in the iron end steel trade.   The slight stimulus which followed the abandonment of the gold standard appears to have been short lived, a,nd the depreciation of the   is no protection against the low prices being quoted by Continental manufacturers: even now these are as much as  2 per ton below British prices, and it is admitted that they represent in many cases a loss to the producers of as much as 20/- per ton.    Imports in November went up to the very high figure of 379,400 tons, valued at  2,570,000, and it is suggested th&quot;t the aim has been to secure a. maximum tonnage in Great Britain before the doors are closed by a tariff.    There was, however,  some improvement in the British production of pig iron in November;    four more blast furnaces were blown in, and the output rose from 284,000 tons (October) to 296,000 tons, while for the first time since December, 1929, employment improved in the production of iron and steel castings, chiefly at the heavy end.   Exports of iron
and steel manufactures were better than in October, but the value  2,842,000 showed a narrow margin only over imports. Canada, hitherto a good customer, is practically out of the market for the present,  and the foreign enquiries which are still being made appear to be leading to no tangible results. At home there has been some increase in the demand for structural ster-1, but otherwise little improvement in the prospects of consuming industries.Shipbuilding is the only other iron and steel consuming industry which has shown some improvement.   Several orders were placed during the month for medium-cized ships, besides the large order for the replacement of the &quot;Bermuda&quot;, and a number of repair orders were gained in the face of for elm competition.   There have been a number of sales of ships for breaking up, but a number of second-hand ships have also been sold abroad for trading.   The tonnage laid up remains substantially unchanged, and the shipping position generally has shown no improvement.    In spite of the fall in sterling, freights only rose by 1 per cent, during the month, and on the long trades the cost of going out in ballast is about equal to the loss on taking outward cargo.Employment   improved in the general engineering industry and there was a greater volume of enquiry.    Orders placed during, the month include machine tools for Russia (^250,000), railway material for Egypt, India and South America, and textile machinery for India (C200,000).In the motor vehicle industry also employment improved. This industry continues, exceptionally, to derive real advantage from the depreciation of sterling, and its representative reports that the export trade shows signs of expanding especially if favourable tariff arrangements can be made.   In the home market, the sales of small cars are keeping
up, but otherwise the market is feeling the general depression and the anxiety about calls for income tax in January;    foreign competition in the home market remains negligible.There was no material change in the electrical industry during the month.     A number of the recent import duties affect this industry, hut their incidence cannot be felt until the large stocks already imported are e xhausted.     There has been some slowing up in orders for the grid in the latter half of the year, but it is satisfactory that the figures of units generated in October show a marked improvement on those for the preceding three months.The representative of the non-ferrous metals industry reported that the position is a little better, hut that in so far as trade has improved for this country, it has been due rather to orders being gained from foreign manufacturers than to any real expansion in world demand.     In the Par Sast alone there has been, it is thought, a real expansion owing to the increased price of silver and possibly in the case of lead, to other causes.In the building industry unemployment is already high and there is every indication that it will become higher in the next month or two.     This is partly seasonal, but it is also clear that a large amount of work (housing and other) -estimated at  30,000,000 - has been cancelled by local authorities in response to the general appeal for economy.The October improvement in the cotton industry was not entirely maintained in November, and the advantages resulting from the exchange were to some extent offset by the continuance of the world depression and exchange difficulties. The demand for yarn and cloth declined, and, except for the bleaching section, orders were disappointing.     With Japan out of the Chinese market prospects there are good, but orders
9^9*\! ts ayin that quarter declined towards the end of the month. Prospects for &quot;business with India were considered brighter on the whole.In the wool trade, on the other hand, the improvement from the exchange situation was maintained and extended (&amp;uring November to the weaving section, machinery activity being 77 per cent, in November, conrpared with 71.6 per cent, in October.     Benefit was felt in the woollen and worsted industry from the new emergency duties, firstly on piece goods and then on yarns.     The report from the hosiery industry v/as not quite so good as for last month;    the improvement continues, but it shows signs of being largely temporary, and in some districts trade is already tending to drop off.     It was stated that the announcement of a bO% duty on woollen yarns was received with mixed feelings both by the hosiery industry and by the manufacturers of. ready-made garments and of cloth for export.As regards other industries, the chemical industry reports a continuance of the general, though still slight, improvement in almost all branches, including increased demand for chemicals and dyestuffs from Lancashire and from the silk trade    that 3ritish manufacturers have been the chief beneficiaries appears to be due more to the &quot;Buy British&quot; campaign than to a difference in price.     The report from the rubber industry generally is not quite so good, owing partly to the unseasonable weather.     The demand for rubber footwear has been good in the home market, though Japanese competition continues to be a serious menace abroad,The price of wheat fell during the month, and is now at a level about equal to the September gold standard rate plus the loss for the decline in exchange rates.    Canadian stocks are still high, and good supplies are afloat from Australia, who has sold altogether this season 132,354,000 bushels, compared with
49,600,000 &quot;bushels last season.     Russia is not pressing to sell at present, hut she has large stocks of grain in the United Kingdom already, and it is estimated that shipment contracts for Russian grain this season to date exceed those for last season hy about 33 per cent.     Adverse criticism of the proposed wheat quota came from the representative of the Scotch Co-operative Societies, who thought they would have difficulty in obtaining the requisite amount of millable wheat in Scotland.The Scotch Co-operative Society for the first time for many months reported an actual decrease in quantities   sold. The figures for the English Gc-operative Societies and in the distributing trade generally have not yet been received for November, but it is anticipated that a large aggregate drop in value will be shown, although it is stated that the &quot;Buy British&quot; campaign has made a strong appeal throughout the country.      The figures for October show, contrary to expectation, that trade (by   value) was only down by about 6.1 per cent.      (&quot;West of London 14 per cent.)  compared with much larger reductions in Germany and the United States.In the general financial situation the outstanding feature of the month was the renewed depreciation in the pound.      Gilt-edged securities slowly declined during the month, and industrial shares have shown none of the improvement expected after the Election, and instead have lost during the month all the buoyancy which they gained when we abandoned the Gold Standard.     Money is always scarce in November, but this year it has been more so than usual, and the rate for Treasury and other Bills rose substantially during the month.     There were some new capital issues, but it is difficult to get money for fixed-interest-bearing securities while the future value of sterling remains unknown.
The cahlegram from Australia again reports improvement in all important exports compared with last season;    in particular the wheat, flour, butter and meat exports were exceptionally heavy.The Indian representative reports that prices of the staple Indian commodities have risen slightly but generally, and that there has been a striking increase in the export of gold.     Both these factors are satisfactory, as pointing to increased purchasing power, but on the other hand it is thought that the threat of a further boycott against British goods is likely to develop, as being the only way in which Congress can save its face.     The experience of the Colonies has been somewhat different, as prices of their staple products generally have tended to stay on the old sterling basis.In South American countries there are some signs of improvement.      In the Argentine the election results are considered to indicate that there will be a good period for the expansion of British trade.     The new crops are stated to be above those of last year, and there is no carry-over of wheat.     In the first 10 months of the year exports have exceeded imports by  20 million sterling, and although there are still restrictions on exchange, the outlook is better: the economies of the past year have widened the potential purchasing power of the country, and the comparative value of the United States dollar gives this country a special advantage.     Everything, however, depends naturally upon the capacity of the Argentine to dispose of its grain and meat in the coming season, and anxiety in regard to the Wheat Quota arrangements here was expressed on behalf of British capital interests in Argentina.     In Brazil, also, there has been some improvement and a slight lessening of control of exchange. Difficulties in the disposal of coffee remain, however, and
although 1,700,000 hags have been destroyed out of the proceeds of the 10/- per bag export tax, existing stocks are large, and the new crop surplus is estimated at about 30 million bags. In Uruguay, Colombia and Chile the position remains as before. In Chile there is severe unemployment, and practically the whole of the Mercantile Marine is laid up in harbour, as there is no freight offering.
