THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET . COPY NO.cabinet.C .P.305(31)REFT    RESTRICTIONS. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.     A decision is necessary on policy as to the future of the Rent Restrictions Acts.2.     A Departmental Committee was appointed by the Labour Government in 1930, under the chairmanship of Lord Marley.    All parties in the House were represented on the Committee^ which also contained representatives of the judiciary, of Local Authorities, and of Government Departments.   The Committee reported in July last and were unanimous, with the exception of Mr. Duncan Graham, M.P., who submitted a minority report.3.     Since the issue of the Report a number of Parliamentary Questions have been addressed to me, in reply to which I have stated that the future of the Rent Restrictions Acts is being considered by the Government In the light of the Report,    In the meantime the Acts have been included in the Expiring Laws Bill.4.     The first point for decision is whether, in present circumstances, amending legislation Is nedessary.   The question arises principally in connection with the present law of decontrol.    Generally a controlled hous6 is automatically decontrolled when it comes into oossession of the landlord.5.     The actual situation in brief is this.   There Is still an acute shortage of the lowest rented houses for the poorest of the wage-earning class.     Private
enterprise cannot be expected to do much to remedy this shortage in the foreseeable future.     With building costs at their present level these houses cannot be built to pay.6.     In spite of the shortage this class of house is being gradually decontrolled.     About one eighth of the class is now free.     The result is acute local hardships and grievances about profiteering in rents in respect of the decontrolled houses.     Other evils resulting from the decontrol while there is still shortage in the class are (a) immobilisation of labour; protected tenants are afraid to move:    and (b) hindrance to the healthy process of filtering up from the slums; the rent of a decontrolled house rises and it ceases to be available fi^r the poorest class.7.       On the other hand good progress has been made towards meeting the shortage in the better sort of house in the controlled class.     Private enterprise can operate with profit in this fields aad, if left to itself, will, it may be hoped, within the foreseeable future   meet the demand.     Decontrol of this class of house has been going on more rapidly.     Between a third and a quarter are now free.     With the shortage being overtaken, no substantial hardships or evils follow the decontrol.8.       What is needed under these conditions is firstly to hasten the decontrol of the better class of houses.     That should hasten the supply, by helping private enterprise to work freely in the sphere in which it can work with profit.     What is needed secondly is that decontrol of the class of the smallest and cheapest houses should be stopped until the acute
shortage therein is over.     ,That is necessary to put . an end to the evils and grievances to which reference has been made.     To stop decontrol of this class should neither hasten nor retard provision of houses of the type by private enterprise, becs,use with building costs as they are private enterprise cannot build such houses at a profit in any case.9.     Such F-Ction as to decontrol would imply certain consequences as to housing subsidy.      If we stop decontrolling the smaller houses we are implicitly giving up for the present the idea that the shortage in these houses can be met by private enterprise.      It follows that the whole effort of public enterprise in the form of subsidy and rate-aid should be concentrated on the provision of these smaller houses.     By concentrating on them, we shall be hastening the day of decontrol for the smaller houses by increasing the only present source of supply, and we shall be stimulating private enterprise to supply the better class of houses by leaving it a free field for the purpose.10.     Such is the outline of the action contemplated -to stop deoontrol of the smaller houses, to hasten decontrol of the larger, and to concentrate aid from subsidy and rates on the building of the smaller.     In this memorandum we are concerned with aotion as to decontrol only, not as to the implied new orientation of subsidy pGlicy. In general the account of the situation given above is supported by the Report of the three-party Departmental Committee referred to, and the action proposed rhove is in accordance with the recommendations.
11.     Extremists of the Opposition have put forward an impracticable plan en the lines of the minority report -viz: complete control of all houses within the rental limits of the Act (including new and municipally-owned houses) and a reduction of rents to pre-war level. This has provoked an equally impracticable demand for complete remeval of control.     On the other hand, there is evidence of a feeling in more responsible quarters that there is a definite need for amending legislation which will improve the working of the Acts and go some way to remedy  admitted defects in the present system. That feeling has found expression in the Report of the Departmental Committee, and the very existence of that Report - almost unique in its evidence of practical unanimity on so controversial a subject between men of different political convictions - strengthens the case for action.12.     Any legislation on this subject must be contentious and a Bill to give effect to the Committee&apos;s Report, which has an element of a compromise, will not satisfy extremists on either side.     But inaction will not avoid controversy and the Government would be on strong ground in fathering legislation based on a practically unanimous report.13.     I propose accordingly that legislation should be introduced based on the recommendations of the Committee.     A copy of their report accompanies this Memorandum, with an analysis * of its main provisions. Houses within the existing rental limits of the Act would be dealt with in three categories and treated in the light of demand and supply.     The more highly*    Shown as an Appendix.
rented houses would &quot;be decontrolled, because the demand is being substantially satisfied by private enterprise;    the medium rented houses would still be controlled but subject, as at present, to decontrol on becoming empty, because, although the need for houses in this category is still unsatisfied, private and municipal enterprise have made, and are continuing to make, substantial progress towards meeting it.    The lowest rented houses would continue to be controlled without specified time limit.   The present decontrolling provisions should not apply to them, because, as said, the shortage is still notoriously acute.14. The limits of the three categories suggested by the Committee are, in terms of current rateable value, as follows.-Metropolitan Police provinces.pistrTcflr.    &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;    &quot;&apos;Class A  45, or over  35, or overClass B Over  20 but under  45 Over  13 but under 35Class C  20 or under  13 or under.I think that the lower limit of Class A might with advantage be put at a smaller figure both in London and^the provinces.    The field in which supply is substantially up to demand can be shown to extend to a rather smaller type of houso than that represented by the rateable value limits taken- say to houses of  35 rateable value in London and  25 rateable value elsewhere.   There is, howovor, great political advantage in following an closely as possible the recom-mendations of the Committee.    1 advise therefore that the Bill should be drawn closely on tho linos of the Committoo1s report and that tho feeling of the Houso shculd bo tested on
the point during the passage of the Bill.    If it were found that an extension of the category of houses to he decontrolled would be accepted the Bill could be amended.15.       If legislation is to be introduced soon after the recess, the drafting of the Bill should be put in hand with-out delay and I accordingly ask for authority for the preparation of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.(Intd.)     EoH-Y.December 4th, 1931.
Appendix.RESTRICTIONS   ACTS,Analysis of main provisions of the Report of thej^epartiueiit&amp;l.Committee.The Committee was appointed by the late Labour Government in Ootober 1930.      It consisted of a Labour Chairman (Lord Marley) , four Labour Members of Parliament, two Conservatives said one Liberal, and representatives of the judiciary, Local Authorities and Government officials.      It reported in July 1931, and the Committee were unanimous.    \th the exception of Mr. Duncan Graham, M.P., who submitted a minority report.A useful summary of the history of rent restriction and of the outlines of the present law is given at the beginning of the Beport.Summary of reoonmiendations of Committee other thanMr. Duncan Graham.s. 20-38. The Committee take the view that the question ofcontinuance of control for different sections of the communitymust depend on the facts of the housing situation for eachsection, and in Parts III and IV of their Report they embodyan important statistical review of the housing position,    Thenet result of that review is that of the total number of housesfalling within the rental limits of the Aot (9,060,000)approximately 31$ are uncontrolled and 69$ controlled.They may be classified as follows:-Hew houses (never controlled)  ......       1,660,000Old houses,  decontrolled35......       1,140,000Old houses,  still controlled......       6,260,000louse which became empty since 19S3 automatically ceased to be controlled under the Act of that year.RENT
The Committee state that their main conclusions flow from the premiss that the desirability of decontrolling any class of house is dependent on whether the shortage in that class has been, or is rapidly being, overtaken.      They find that, for the working classes, the shortage in many districts is still acute, whereas for other classes it has been or is being overtaken.     Accordingly their main and most important recommendation is that the more expensive houses (designated for convenience Class A) should &quot;be decontrolled forthwith, and that, as regards the remainder, the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should continue to apply to the more highly rented houses (Class B) but should cease to apply to the lower rented houses (Class C.)For the purposes of their recommendations the Committee propose to classify houses at present within the scope of the Acts by reference to Rateable Value as at April last, as follows: -Metropolitan Police District.Class A.     45 or overClass B.    Over  20 but under  45.Class C.     20 or underRest of England and Wales.&apos; 35 or overOver  13 but under  35. 13 or underScotland. 45 or overOver  26.5 but under  45. 26,5.  or undGr.(The equivalentsof these figures in terms of weekly rentals are tabulated at the end of the report).recommendations are also made in regard to other important - though relatively minor - aspects of the inquiry, including proposals to minimise the abuses of sub-letting, and to amend and simplify the law in regard to landlords obtaining possession in order - inter alia - to secure that important
schemes oi development ere not hampers u. or prevented.    The Committee have refrained from adopting various suggestions for amending the Acts in point of detail,  in view of the large volume of case law on the Acts,  and have confined their recommendations to the remedyine of substantial hardship or injustice.      They do, however, recommend consolidation sf the Acts at an early date.39-41.    Class A. Houses.The Committee are satisfied that a shortage no longer exists in this class of house - mainly occupied by middle class people - and recommend, therefore, that such houses should be decontrolled forthwith.      They point out that the effect of their proposal would be to bring outside the scope ox the Acts about 90C,C00 houses.      They estimate that houses of this class already decontrolled,  together with new houses  (never subject to control)  constitute a clear majority of all the houses in the class.      They suggest that the continuance of control in the interests of a minority of occupiers must be to the detriment of the majority,  in that it artificially restricts the amount,  and so raises the letting 02  selling price,   of houses of this type in the market.    They further point out that, in view of the great amount of new-building in this class of house,  there is no reason to anticipate that owners will be able to exact scarcity rents.43. Class 3. Houses.The Committee point out that a large proportion of the houses built by private enterprise - nearly 70,0OC were built in the six months ended 31st March last - are of this
type, ana are occupied mainly by a class consisting,  at one end of the scale,  of the better-paid artesans,  ana, at the other end,  of the less well paid members of the middle classes.      They add that a large number of municipal houses have been, and are being, occupied by this class of person, whose housing needs are by these agencies largely met.   For this category of house,  therefore, they consider that gradual decontrol is desirable,  and recommend that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should continue-to apply.44-50,        Class C. Houses.The limits for this class are, generally speaking, the existing limits of rateable value for the compulsory compounding of rates,  and are taken as affording the best available rough definition of a real working class house. The Committee point out  (in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the Report)  that only about one-eighth of such houses have become decontrolled;    that the partial decontrol has caused a great deal of friction and some hardship;    that the rents charged on decontrol are in some cases very high;    and that existing conditions restrict the mobility of labour, since working men are loth to move because in their new home (if they can find one)  they will have no security of tenure *The Committee consider that,  in relation to this class of house,  the decontrolling system introduced by the Act of 1923 has not effected its principal objects, viz: to secure a gradual return to normal conditions without friction and to stimulate building by private enterprise. They accordingly recommend that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should cease to apply to, and that the new Act should place no time limit on the control of, houses of this class.
.51-53.    Mortgages.The Committee recommena that mortgages should remain controlled so long as the mortgaged properties are-controlled;    and, further,  that control of mortgages on Class A houses should remain in force for six months after the date for decontrol of these houses..59-65.    The permitted increase in rent and the enforcement of repairs.The present permitted increase and the factors taken into account in its calculation are submitted to a careiul analysis in paragraphs 59 - 65 of the Report. Briefly, the present permitted increase  (viz:  40% on the pre-war net rent)  is made up as to 25% for increased cost of repairs ana,  as to the rest, for increased yield on capital.      The cost of repairs,.doubtless, has decreased since 192C (when the permitted increases were fixed), but, in the case of the smallest houses - which alone the Committee would retain indefinitely under control - 25% of the rental is still,  in their view, little  (if any)  more than sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance.     as regards the balance of the 40% the Committee do not consider the increased j^iela unreasonable.      The Committee,  therefore, find themselves unable to recommend any alteration of the permittee increase,  but,  regarding the allowance for 66-71.      repairs as not inadequate, recommend that every practicable step should be taken to secure that the landlord does his duty in keeping the properties in good ana tenantable repair.      They make certain proposals which are designed to secure that tenants may be made more aware of their legal right to have their houses kept in proper repair.
Recover:/ of Possession.Under the existing law, a landlord, before he can recover possession, must satisfy the Court not only that alternative accommodation las defined) is available but that the ground of his application falls within grounds specified in the Act of 1923,  e.e. that he needs the house for the occupation of himself or members of his household or employees or for purposes of public interest, a. 77. The Committee consider that Parliament should notconcern itself with the reason why a landlord desires to recover possession, provided that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant, and that the full discretion of the Court is retained to take account of all the circumstances in considering whether it is reasonable th?t the tenant should move.     They recommend that the law should be simplified accordingly.      In ?.ddition, they propose a a. 74. slight relaxation of the present definition of &quot;alternative accommodation&quot; by bringing in Council Houses, though they are not controlled, s. 81. Further, the Committee sugsest an amendment ofthe present law which would assist owners in obtaining possession of houses for their own or their family&quot;s occupation.      They recommend that the right already possessed by persons who acquired tenanted houses before May 1924 (the date of introduction of the Prevention of Eviction Bill) . shall be extended to persons acquiring such houses at any time ux^ to the date of the report.      Such persons would then be able to apply for possession, without proving alternative accommodation,  on the ground of &quot;greater hardship&quot;.
61Sub-letting.Under the present law, a person to whom unfurnished rooms in a controlled house are lawfully sub-let is entitled to the same protection (i.e. restricted rent and security of tenure) ss the tenant of a controlled house, and he can, if necessary,  get his proper rent settled by the County Court. But sub-tenants, from ignorance or diffidence, notoriously fail to claim their rights in this respect, and it is well known that exorbitant rents are frequently extracted from them.The Committee recoenize the existence of these abuses, but point out that it would be worse than useless to suggest a. remedy that would drastically restrict sub-letting, which, so Ion? as a housing shortage remains, manifestly will and should.89.    continue.      They reject sugsjestions made by certain witnesses as over-elaborate or otherwise objectionable, and recommenda.95.    that a tenant of a controlled house should be required to notify his landlord if he is sub-letting;   that the chargingof extortionate rents (i.e. in excess of any rent settled bythe Court) shall be an offence;    and that the landlord shouldhave the ris-ht to apply for possession on the ground of a tenant&apos;s excessive charae to a sub-tenant and, in such a case,that the Court be empowered at discretion to dispossess thetenant or to fix rent to be paid by the sub-tenant either tothe tenant or the landlord as may be thought fit.as. The Committee also refer to the letting of furnished-84.rooms.     Under the present law, the sub-tenant of furnished rooms has no security of tenure,  but there is a provision -Section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act 1920 - making extortionate charges for furnished lettines an offence.      (Is &quot;extortionate&quot; is defined by reference to comparative profits
pre-war and now,  it will be realised that it is difficult to prove extortion and that,  therefore,  the provision is of no great practical effect.)The Committee received some evidence of profiteering in certain areas in the letting of furnished rooms, but they find themselves in agreement with the conclusions of earlier Committees that effective control is not possible without forbidding eviction, and that this is not practicable in the case of furnished lettings. They are accordingly unable to recommend further statutory provision to deal wish the point.Rent Courts.The Committee draw attention to the essential difference between the system which has teen established in this country under which rents have to conform to s. nationally enacted standard,  the jurisdiction of the Courts being confined to matters of interpretation,  etc., ana the system which has been established in some other countries where rent contracts are ratified and fair rents are settled according to individual circumstances by special Rent Courts.      They poinv. out that the British system is not one on which the system of Rent Courts could easily or appropriately be grafted,  and that the County and Sheriff Courts which administer the Acts have by now gained great experience and knowledge of the Acts and command general confidence.      In these circumstances they do not consider that the establishment of any new judicial tribunal ouch as a Rent Court is either necessary or desirable,   but they recommend that local authorities should be empowered to appoint committees for the purpose of giving advice on questions arising under the
Acts. The question is fully discussed in paragraphs 97 - 99 of the Report.5S. Minority Report by Mr. Duncan Graham.Mr. Duncan Graham differs from his colleagues on various points of principle.     He recommends a figure of  60 pre-war rent,  excluding rates, as the figure above which decontrol should be allowed in Scotland;    he considers that, below this figure, all decontrolled houses should be brought back under control,  and that control should be extended to all post-war houses including municipal houses;    he disagrees with the view that the permitted increase of rent should be continued, though he does not make it clear whether or not he would permit any increase over the 1914 rent;    he recommends that no alteration should be made in the law  is to the recovery of possession, and that the question of Rent Courts should be further explored.

4. Written Evidence. &quot;We have, in addition, been supplied with elaborate statistical information by the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland; and we have received memo-randa, statements of evidence, and representations from over 50 organisations, bodies and individuals, including the following:  The Parliamentary Committee of the. Co-operative Con-gress.The Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Trades councils and Labour Parties. The Welsh Housing and Development Association. The Scottish Divisional Council of the Independent LabourParty.The Incorporated Society of Auctioneers and Landed Pro-perty Agents. The National Association of Auctioneers.

A large proportion of the letters received from individual landlords have represented the position of the &quot; one house owner.&quot;5. We have thus been furnished with a wealth of evidence, which, it appears to the Committee, has been fully representative of all the interests concerned and of every aspect of the question.II. HISTORICAL OUTLINE AND GENERAL SCHEME OFTHE ACTS.Evolution of the Acts.6. The Rent Restrictions Acts are temporary measures which have now been in force for over fifteen years. It seems desirable, therefore, to review shortly their origin and evolution, and recall
their main provisions. The Acts had their origin during the early years of the war, when, owing to the cessation of building opera-tions, the shortage of houses for the accommodation of the working classes, already apparent to some extent before the war, became more acute. It was claimed that the rents of working-class houses, particularly in the industrial towns and in centres engaged in the manufacture of munitions, were being raised, and it was feared that this condition might extend to other classes of houses.7. The Act of 1915. In 1915 the first Rent Restriction Act was passed The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restric-tions) Act, 1915. The object of this Act was to prevent (a) any increase of rent, (b) the eviction of tenants, (c) an increase in the rate of interest on. mortgages, (d) the calling in of mortgages. The Act applied to houses not exceeding a rent or rateable value of  35 in London (Metropolitan Police District),  30 in Scotland and  26 elsewhere. The Act was due to continue for the duration of the war and for six months after.8. Since the Act of 1915 there have been passed ten Statutes dealing with the restriction of rent and mortgage interest. It will be sufficient to mention the most important of these Acts.(i) The Act of 1919* followed the Report of Lord Hunter&apos;s Committee, appointed by the Minister of Reconstruction in 1919. This Act doubled the original rental limits of houses on which control was imposed, raising them to  70 in London,  60 in Scotland and  52 elsewhere. The Act permitted an increase of rent not exceeding 10 per cent., and an increase in the rate of mortgage interest not exceeding ^ per cent., subject to a maximum rate of 5 per cent. The Act also prolonged to 1921 the duration of the Act of 1915, but it was repealed in 1920.(ii) The Act of 1920t followed the Report of the Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Salisbury, appointed by the Minister of Health in 1920. This Act is the principal Act, and is still in force. The main provisions of the existing law are dealt with in later paragraphs, but it may be here stated that the Act of 1920 repealed the earlier Acts, trebled the original limits of control, thus bringing in houses of a rent or rateable value of  105 in London,  90 in Scotland and  78 elsewhere, permitted increases in rents up to 40 per cent, over the 1914 rent, and raised the permitted increase in the rate of mortgage interest to 1 per cent., subject to a maximum rate of Q\ per cent.It will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs that control was imposed in three stages, and that the original limits of the 1915 Act were doubled in 1919, and trebled in 1920. The following table shows the various stages in which the three categories of houses were brought into control, and the increases permitted in rent and niort-gage interest.* Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1919. t Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920.

Act of 1923* followed the Report of the Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Onslow, appointed in 1922 by the Minister of Health and the Secretary for Scotland. Besides amending the principal Act in various respects, this Act intro-duced certain completely new provisions in that (a) it shifted the control in effect from the house to the tenancy by providing for decontrol of a house (with certain exceptions) whenever a landlord came into possession, (b) in anticipation of the end of the present system of control Part II of the Act enacted tem-porary provisions for a transitional period after the lapse of the present system.(iv) The Prevention of Eviction Act, 1924, substituted for certain provisions in the Act of 1923 certain new provisions governing the case of the owner who wanted possession for his own occupation.(v) The Act of 1925 prolonged the. duration of the principal Act, as amended by the Act of 1923, to 25th December, 1927, in England and Wales, and to 28th May, 1928, in Scotland.The operation of the Acts has since been continued from year to year by the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts, and without further legislation the Acts would expire on the 25th December, 1931, in England and Wales, and on the 28th May, 1932, in Scotland.9. Previous Committees. There have been three previous Com-mittees of Inquiry into the operation of the Acts the Hunter Com-mittee, the Salisbury Committee and the Onslow Committee and ii The approximate relationship between certain annual rateable values and rents is shown in the Appendix.It will be seen, from the table there given, that in England and Wales the number of pounds in the pre-war rateable value is in a typical case approximately equal to the number of shillings in the current weekly con-trolled rent, inclusive of rates.Thus the Acts at present include within their scope houses which, if they were let on weekly tenancies, would have a current inclusive controlled rent of the order of  5 os. a week in London and nearly  4 a week in the Provinces.* Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act, 1923.
our deliberations have been much assisted by the study of their Reports. The first of these was the Committee -whose Report pre-ceded the Act of 1919. Lord Hunter -was the Chairman. The Becond was the Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Salis-bury, -whose Report preceded the Act of 1920. The third Committee was that -which was originally appointed in 1922. The Chairman was Sir Henry Norman and the Committee made an interim Report in October, 1922. The Committee was re-appointed in December, 1922, under the Chairmanship of the Earl of Onslow, and its Report, issued in February, 1923, preceded the Act of 1923.Present Law.10. The principal objects of the Acts at present in force are to fix a maximum percentage increase in pre-war rents, to provide security of tenure for tenants, and to limit the rate of interest on and to prevent the calling in of mortgages. Provisions for a system of decontrol were introduced by the Act of 1923, which provides for decontrol of : -(a) all houses occupied by their owners in July, 1923;(b) houses of which the landlord and tenant have entered into certain agreements under section 2 (2) of the Act;(c) houses which since July, 1923, have come into actual possession of the landlord (except as a result of ejection follow-ing non-payment of rent).11. Houses to which the Acts apply. For the purposes of the Acts, a house includes part of a house let separately. The Acts apply to any house of which either the standard rent or rateable value* does not exceed  105 in London (Metropolitan Police District),  78 elsewhere in England and Wales,  90 in Scotland.The principal exceptions to this rule are :  (i) Any new house, i.e., any house built after the 2nd April, 19i9, or any house bona fide converted since that date into two or more self-contained flats or tenements.(ii) Any house decontrolled under the provisions of the Act of 1923.(iii) Premises used solely for business purposes. Business premises have since the 24th June, 1921, been outside the Acts,* Standard rent is the rent at which the house was lot on the 3rd August, 1914, or if it was not let at that date, the rent at which it was last let prior to that date, or if it was first let after that date, the rent at which it was first let.Rateable value is the rateable value on the 3rd August, 1914, or if the house was first assessed after that date, the rateable value at which it was first assessed.In Scotland rateable value means yearly value according to the Valuation Roll, and rateable value on the 3rd August, 1914, means yearly value according to the Valuation Roll for the vear 1914-1915.
but the fact that part only of a house is used as a shop or for business purposes does not take the premises outside the scope of the Acts.(iv) Furnished lettings.     These  lettings are outside the general scheme of the Acts, but there are certain special provi-sions in regard to the charging of extortionate rents.   These provisions are referred to in paragraph 82. 12. Sxib-tenancies. The law in regard to sub-tenancies is set out in paragraphs S5-S6.13. Permitted increases of Rent. The Acts limit the amount by which the rent of a controlled house may be increased. The Acts permit:  (i) An increase of 15 per cent, of the net rent.*(ii) Where the landlord is responsible for the whole of the repairs, an increase of 25 per cent, of the net rent.(These two items together form what is generally known as the 40 per cent, increase.)(iii) Where the landlord pays the rates, an increase of rent equal to the amount of any increased rates payable hy him.In Scotland this increase, so far as regards landlords rates proper (i.e., rates payable by him other than occupier&apos;s rates for which he is responsible), is not permitted in respect of any increase in the amount of such rates after Whitsunday, 1920.(iv) Where expenditure has been incurred by the landlord in the structural alteration or improvement of the house, an increase equivalent to 8 per cent, per annum of the amount expended by him. If such expenditure was incurred between the 4th August, 1914, and the 2nd July, 1920, the permitted increase is 6 per cent, instead of S per cent.(v) Where part of a house is lawfully sub-let, an increase in the rent of the whole house by 5 per cent, of the net rent of the part sub-let; and also an increase in the rent of the part sub-let by 10 per cent, of the net rent of that part.An increase of rent which is in excess of these permitted increases is irrecoverable from the tenant.A tenant can apply to the County Courtt for an Order suspending the whole of the 40 per cent, increase, if he is able to satisfy the Court by a certificate of the sanitary authority, or otherwise, that the house is not in a reasonable state of repair, or alternatively, he may merely withhold the 40 per cent, increase, and, if he is sued for pay-ment, may put in the certificate as presumptive (though not conclu-sive) evidence that the house was not, and is not, in a reasonable state of repair.*Nel rent is tho standard rent less the amount of tenanfs rates where these are paid by the landlord; where the tenant pays the rates direct the net rent is the standard rent.t Throughout this Report &quot; County Court &quot; means &quot; the Sheriff Court &quot; where applicable to Scotland.
14. Premiums. Tihe taking of premiums or key money by land-lords in respect of controlled houses is punishable by a fine not exceeding  100, and such payments made since 1920 are recoverable from the landlord. Inasmuch as most empty houses are now decon-trolled these provisions have had no practical effect since 1923.Similarly a statutory tenant (i.e., one who is staying on in a con-trolled house merely by virtue of the Acts) can be fined for demand-ing from any person except his landlord a premium for giving \ip possession.15. Protection against Eviction. A landlord may not recover possession of a controlled house except by Order of the Court, and before making an Order the Court must in all cases be satisfied that it would be reasonable to do so. Application may be made on certain specified grounds, the chief of which are the following:   (i) Where the tenant has not paid his rent.(ii) Where the tenant, or any other person residing in the house, is a nuisance, or has been convicted of using the house for an immoral or illegal purpose, or is causing the house to deteriorate.(iii) Where the tenant has, without the consent of the landlord,sub-let the whole of the house.(iv) Where the tenant of licensed premises has conducted thebiisiness to the dissatisfaction of the licensing or police authorities, or detrimentally to the public interest, or the licence has been refused, (v) Where the landlord reasonably requires the house as a residence for himself, or for his son or daughter over 18 years of age, or for any person living with him, or for some person employed by him. (vi) Where the house is required for any purpose which, in theopinion of the Court, is in the public interest. In cases falling under (vi) the Court must be satisfied that alter-native accommodation is available.   The Court must also be satis-fied as regards alternative accommodation in cases falling under (v) except in certain special circumstances, which are broadly:  (a) Where the house was let to the tenant in consequence of his employment and he has left that employment;(b) Where the house is required for a person whose work is necessary for the proper working of an agricultural holding;(c) Where the landlord became landlord by purchase on or beforethe 5th May, 1924, and he reasonably requires his house as a residence for himself, or for his son or daughter over IS years of age, and the Court is satisfied that greater hardship would be caused by refusing the Order than by granting it. The definition of alternative accommodation is given in para-graph 74.Where a landlord has obtained an Order for possession on any of the grounds specified in (v) above by misrepresenting or conceal-ing the facts, the Court may order the landlord to pay damages to the dispossessed tenant.
16. Death of Tenant. Where a tenant dies without leaving a will, his widow, if living with hirn at the time of his death, becomes the new tenant. Where a tenant leaves no widow, or was a woman, one of the tenanfs family who was living with the deceased tenant when he or she died becomes the new tenant. Any dispute as to which member of the family is to become the new tenant is settled by the County Court.IT. Mortgages. The Acts apply to mortgages on property con-sisting of one or more houses falling within the scope of the Acts, but they do not apply where the mortgage was created after 2nd July, 1920. An increase of 1 per cent, in the rate of interest is permitted, subject to an overriding maximum of 6-J- per cent. A mortgagee is restricted from calling in his mortgage or enforcing his security so long as the interest is not more than 21 days in arrear, the covenants by the mortgagor are observed, and the mortgagor keeps the property in proper repair. These provisions as to the calling in of mortgages do not, however, apply to a mortgage where the principal is repay-able by instalments spread over 10 years or more, nor do they affect any power of sale possessed by a mortgagee in possession on the 25th March, 1920, or where the mortgagor consents to the exercise by the mortgagee of his powers under the mortgage. If the Court is satis-fied that a mortgage of leasehold property is seriously diminishing iti value, it may authorise the mortgagee to call in.18. Administration. The administration of the Acts is not vested in any Department of Government, all questions of dispute being settled by the. Courts, who have jurisdiction, inter alia, to decide summarily any question as to the amount of rent, net rent, standard rent, apportionment of standard rent, or permitted increase of rent; and they have wide discretion in connection with Orders for possession.19. It will be seen from the foregoing historical sketch that when restrictions were first imposed they were imposed by no means exclusively for the protection of the working classes. They were a war measure designed to protect tenants from increases of rent owing to the temporary stoppage of building during the war. The restrictions were not confined to working-class houses, but applied to all houses below certain limits of rent or rateable value which have already been mentioned, and, as will presently be seen, applied to approximately 85 per cent, of all the dwelling houses in Great Britain. The later Acts of 1919 and 1920 extended control to the higher rented categories of houses until about 98 per cent, of all the houses in the country were brought within the limits. Since then a decade has passed, and, except for the Act of 1923 which intro-duced decontrol of individual houses in certain circumstances, con-trol has been maintained for all classes of houses on the ground, presumably, that the shortage of houses for all classes still con-tinued, and that the removal of control might mean the widespread exaction of scarcity rents.
III. STATISTICAL ASPECTS OE THE INQUIRY.20. It seemed to us at the outset of our inquiry that our first essential task must be to attempt to get a clear picture of the present housing situation for different sections of the community, on which the continuance of control for each section must, in our view, depend. We knew, on the one hand, that more than 1^ million new houses, mostly of a small type, had been built since the war, and, on the other hand, that there was a considerable, amount of evidence that in many areas the worst cases of overcrowding showed no sigiii of improvement, that when houses became decontrolled high rents were too often demanded and obtained, and, generally, that the housing situation for the poorer paid workers was alleged by many competent observers to be still very far from satisfactory. And the early evidence which we received, coming from witnesses who each had experience of a limited section of the population, con-firmed our view that a careful investigation of the statistical aspects of our inquiry was of the first importance. Unfortunately, no exact statistics of the kind we required were in existence, but it was thought that it should be possible, by examination of the figures supplied to us by the Government Departments, and of the evidence received from witnesses, to make sufficiently accurate estimates for the purpose of our inquiry. We have accordingly made a thorough examination of all the available material with a view to making the best estimates we could of the approximate numbers of pre-war and new houses in different categories of value, in particular the categories of the 1915, 1919 and 1920 Acts and other categories which sugg-ested themselves, such as the categories of the different compounding limits;35 the approximate extent of decontrol in each category under the provisions of the Act of 1923, and the genera! level of rents charged on decontrol. The figures which we give below are necessarily approximations 011I3-.As we have said, the exact statistics which we needed did not exist; moreover, there have been changes in the law and practice of rating and in the level of assessments, which further complicated our task. We, therefore, had to make a number of assumptions in drawing deductions from the figures which were available. The main sources from which we. deduced the figures were the 59th Annual Report of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, CM. 8425, the statistics of new building supplied by the Departments, and the evidence of the Ministry of Labour. With the material, and in the time at our disposal, we have made the best estimates we could.* It is open to a local authority to resolve that the owners of houses whose rateable value is less than a certain amount are to be liable for the rates ot such houses.The limits of rateable value (in Scotland yearly value) are :   20 p.a. in London,  16 5s. p.a. in Liverpool,  13 p.a. in the Provinces, ranging from  12 10s. p.a. to  26 os. p.a. in Scotland according to the populn-tion of the burgh or special district.These limits arc known among rating authorities as the statutory coni-Dounding limits.
and we think they are sufficiently accurate to give a correct general picture, hut it is important that the character of the figures should be understood, and that they should not be treated as having any high degree of statistical accuracy.21. Extent of Decontrol and general level of rents charged on Decontrol. We received valuable information from the Ministry of Labour in regard to the extent of decontrol in, and the average level of rents charged on decontrol for, working-class houses. The evidence which we received from them, based on extensive surveys, shows that about one-eighth of the work-ing-class houses have become decontrolled under the provisions of the Act of 1923, and that the decontrolled rents of such houses range on an average from 85-90 per cent, above the pre-war rent (inclusive of rates) as compared with the 50 per cent, increase in the rent (inclusive of rates) of a controlled house. (This 50 per cent, is composed of the permitted increase of 40 per cent, plus an addition for increased rates.) Thus, for example, on the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures, a house the pre-war inclusive rent of which was 6s. would have an average controlled inclusive rent of 9s.; on decontrol the rent would rise on an average to 11s. 3d.According to some witnesses, increases in rent on decontrol were very much higher than these figures; according to others, very much lower. Each of these witnesses necessarily spoke of his own limited experience, and none had had an opportunity to take a statistical average over a sufficiently large number of investigated cases. The primary investigations of the Ministry of Labour extended over half a million tenancies in large towns with populations exceeding 50,000, and in order to be certain that conditions in the small country towns were not so dissimilar as to require any modification to be made in these figures, the Ministry of Labour undertook at our request a sample inquiry in certain selected country towns and sur-rounding districts, the result of which was to confirm the figures already given.This evidence, as we have already stated, was confined to work-ing-class houses. This limitation was relatively unimportant so far as the percentage increases in decontrolled rents were concerned, as there was no reason to suppose that any large variation would be found in decontrolled higher rented houses. But it is common knowledge that the extent of decontrol is much greater in the more expensive houses. There are three reasons for this. In the first place, a certain proportion of the houses will have been decontrolled on account of a lease or agreement having been entered into between landlord and tenant. In the second place all owner occupied houses are ipso facto decontrolled. These two causes of decontrol apply mainly to the higher rented houses. The third reason is that the relative increase in the supply of the higher rented houses is greater than the relative increase in working-class houses. Inasmuch as the principal cause of decontrol is that the landlord obtains vacant possession, it seems clear that the greater the supply of new houses in any given class the greater must be the extent of decontrol in that class.   We have taken these three factors into16c6 b
account, and we estimate that between one-tliird and one-quarter of the more expensive houses have become decontrolled. We think that this is a conservative estimate. In the highest range of all, probably almost all the houses are decontrolled as being in occupa-tion of the owner, or let on long lease.The figures of decontrol given in the following paragraphs are accordingly based on these assumptions, that about one-eighth of the smaller houses, between one-third and one-fourth of the more expensive houses, and almost all the most expensive houses, have become decontrolled.22. Total of Pre-ivar* and New Houses, and Number of Pre-war Houses still Controlled. We estimate that the total number of houses in England and Wales is about 9 millions 1\ millions pre-war and 1-1 millions post-war. Of the pre-war houses about Cj millions are still controlled.The comparable figure for Scotland is about 1,120,000 (total), of which about 985,000 are pre-war and 135,000 post-war; and of the pre-war houses about 850,000 are still controlled.23. Total of Controlled Houses in the Middle (1919 Act) and High (1920 Act) Categories. The number of pre-war houses in the middle (1919 Act) and high (1920 Act) categories we estimate to be approximately 850,000, of which more than 300,000 have been decontrolled, leaving more than 500,000 houses still under control.The comparable figure for Scotland is about 66,000 (total), of which more than 20,000 are decontrolled, leaving less than 46,000 still under control.24. Total of Controlled Houses in the Low (1915 Act) category.  The number of pre-war houses in the low (1915 Act) category we estimate to be approximately 6J millions in England and &quot;Wales, of which rather more than   million have been decontrolled, leaving rather less than 5J millions still under control.The comparable figure for Scotland is 920,000, of which about 115,000 have been decontrolled, leaving about 800,000 under control.25. Total of Controlled Houses in the limits of value for the Compulsory Compounding of Rates. The number of pre-war houses within the compounding- limits in England and Wales is about 5 millions, of which about 4f!- millions are still controlled.The comparable figure for Scotland is 700,000, of which more than 600,000 are still controlled.26. Total of New Houses; number for Letting; Effect on shortage in different classes of houses. The foregoing- are broadly the totals of pre-war houses. Since, the Armistice there have been built in England and Wales over 1\ million new houses, of which nearly 600,000 have been built by the local authorities, and may be regarded as available for letting and as forming practically the*It should be noted that the number of houses or huts for habitation built during the war which still survive is negligible.
only supply of new houses for the less well-paid classes of the popu-lation, for whom occupying ownership is rare and in most cases economically impracticable. The number of pre-war houses avail-able for this class may be roughly estimated at a number somewhat greater than the number within the compounding limits i.e., a number between 5 millions and 6 millions. Consequently it may be said that the supply of accommodation available for the poorer section of the population appears to have been increased by about 10 per cent. On the other hand, the supply of houses for the classes who can afford to buy has been increased by about one million, which is an increase of about 50 per cent.In Scotland the number of new houses built (135,000) is com-paratively small, but the percentage increase in houses for sale is very much lower, nearly three-quarters of the new houses built having been built for letting.27. For convenience the approximate figures are set out in the following tables:  ENGLAND AND WALES.Category	(a) Number of pre-war houses.	(b) Estimated number of pre-war houses de-controlled.

HOUSING POSITION.28. These figures suggest that for the working class, who for the most part rent their houses, the shortage in many areas is still acute; whereas for other classes the shortage has been or is being steadily overtaken.29. Work of the Building Societies. In saying that the majority of the working classes rent their houses, we are not overlooking the great modern extension of the valuable work which has long been undertaken by the Building Society move-ment. We have received! interesting evidence from the National Association of Building Societies to the effect that large sums are available for financing the purchase of houses on reasonable terms for the increasing numbers of people who desire and are able to own their own houses. Over  70,000,000 were lent by the Building Societies in 1929, the great bulk of which was lent to intending owner occupiers, and the facilities available through the Building Societies no doubt play an important part in stimu-lating and making possible the annual production of more than 100,000 houses which has been achieved by private, enterprise during
recent years. We have not overlooked the fact that the habit of owner occupation is one which has spread with great rapidity during the last few years among the better-paid members of the working classes and particularly in certain districts, in many cases no doubt owing to the difficulty of obtaining houses to rent. It must be remembered that the activities of Building Societies have always been much greater in some areas than in others; and in Scotland relatively little progress has been made. But, considering the problem of the country as a whole, we have no doubt that it remains true to say that the great majority of the working classes are not in a position (even if they wished) to huy their houses.30. The evidence which we have received, conflicting as it has been on many aspects of our inquiry, has been relatively consistent in regard to the present housing situation, and corroborates the view which we had formed from the statistics. Nearly all witnesses have agreed that very large numbers of the new houses being built are being bought by the middle classes and by the better paid workers in comparatively secure employment; and that there is no longer any general shortage of the more expensive houses. On the other hand, the representatives of the Property Owners Associations and of independent bodies, such as the Land Agents Society and the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution, have agreed with witnesses repre-senting the tenants&apos; interests that there is still a widespread shortage of houses for the poorer paid workers; indeed most of the witnesses who have asked for decontrol have either asked or agreed that control should be taken off by stages, and the date which has been suggested for the decontrol of houses in the lowest category has been put by various witnesses some three to six, or even eight, years ahead, because the particular witness thought either that the shortage would then be overcome or that, shortage or no shortage, the landlord should be entitled to come into his own. For example, the National Federation of Property Owners, who asked for decontrol by stages and of the lowest (1915 Act) category in 1933, admitted that the shortage of houses in the 1915 Act category would not be overcome by 1933, and the demand for decontrol was, therefore, not based on any definite hope that circumstances would have changed, but because, in the Federation^ view, a limit must be set to the period during which property should continue to be controlled irrespective of the duration of the housing shortage. Again, the Property Owners&apos; Protection Association said in effect that private enterprise was unable, and that the local authorities were reluctant, to provide houses for the poorest classes.Discussion of the housing: shortage.31. In England and Wales since the war, from public and private resources, more than  1,000,000,000 has been spent in the building of more than 1^ million new houses. This represents a housing effort which has probably never elsewhere been equalled. It is clear, however, from the evidence, that this large number of new
houses has not had the effect of improving the conditions of the poorest workers to the extent which might have been anticipated. For this we think that there are two principal reasons; in the first place the increase in the number of houses, though large in itself, must be considered in relation to other relevant factors, such as the probable increase in the number of working class families; and, secondly, the general moving or &quot; filtering up &quot; process, on which reliance was placed to improve the conditions of the poorest has, for reasons which we discuss later, not taken place to the extent which was hoped.32. The population in England and Wales has increased in the past ten years by about 2 millions and the number of houses by about millions (sufficient to accommodate, say, 6 million people), so that surplus accommodation, after allowing for demolitions,* has been provided for 4 million persons, which should have gone far to overtake the accumulated shortage. This apparent surplus, however, must be discounted to a considerable extent if, as is believed, the number of separate families has increased at a faster rate than the total population; moreover only about one-third of the new accom-modation consists of houses to let, and it is in such Houses that the main shortage exists.As we have already pointed out it is probable that between 5-6 million pre-war houses are rented by working-class families, and, broadly speaking, constitute, together with the total of nearly 600,000 new municipal houses, the only accommodation available for those who are not in a position to buy their houses. This 10 per cent, increase in the accommodation available for letting must also be considered in relation to the increase in working class population, and particularly to the increase in the number of separate working-class families. Until the results of the latest census are available these figures are not known, but it is safe to say that the relatively small increase of 10 per cent, has provided little or no surplus for overtaking the arrears in this class of accommodation.33. About one million of the new houses which have been built have been built for sale, and the rest, owing to the increased cost of building and the higher standard now required, are let at rents which are higher than the poorer members of the working classes can afford; but it was assumed ten years ago that under these conditions a filtering-up process would take place, those who could afford it moving to the new houses and so relieving the pressure on the lower rented accommodation.* The number of demolitions is negligible in comparison with the number of new houses built. Under slum clearance schemes 11,000-12,000 houses have been demolished; and about 38,000 houses have been the subject of Closing or Demolition Orders, which, however, in many cases have not been enforced owing to the shortage. As regards demolitions by private persons for purposes of business, etc., we have no statistics for the country as a whole but only for London. In London, the total number of demolitions for ail purposes since January, 1920, has been about 9,000, of which about one-third were for business purposes.
75Unfortunately, the evidence before us shows that this process of filtering up has not yet occurred on any substantial scale. It is clear that this indirect approach to the problem depends for its success on a sufficient degree of mobility in the working classes, and the evidence which we have received suggests that the movement of working-class tenants has been less than might have been expected, partly owing to the shortage of houses and partly owing to the general system of control and the partial system of decontrol established by the Rent Restrictions Acts. It appears to us that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 must have had the effect of deterring working-class tenants from moving, as any empty house to which they could move must normally be a decontrolled house. Thus a tenant, if he moved, would lose his security of tenure and normally have to pay a considerably higher rent. In these circum-stances working-class tenants have had every incentive not to move, and the figures supplied by the Ministry of Labour show that seven-eighths of the working-class tenants have, in fact, not moved, only one-eighth of the smaller working-class houses having- become decon-trolled since 1923 under the provisions of the Act of that year.34. It appears, therefore, that the solution of the problem depends partly on the provision of a large number of new houses at low rents, and partly on taking such steps as may be possible to secure that the filtering-up process may have effect on a larger scale.At present the provision of working-class houses to let is under-taken on a large scale only by the local authorities, the rents of whose houses, as we have pointed out, are often higher than the poorer workers can afford. The fact that building costs are now much lower than in the earlier years after the war has not yet been effective in altering this general position, presumably because local authorities feel difficulty in charging different rents for the same type of houses, and so the effect of the recent reductions in cost is weakened by being-spread over all the houses previously btiilt. In spite of this some local authorities are now building, under the Housing Act, 1924, a three bedroomed house to let at a rent of about 10s. inclusive; and there is no doubt that a large supply of houses at this rent would go a long way towards solving the problem.The Housing Act, 1930, was passed with the express object of providing houses for the poorer classes, which will in many cases be let at rents substantially lower than has been possible under the Act of 1924. Local authorities are already beginning effective work under the Act. They have also undertaken a five year pro-gramme, the fulfilment of which will mean the building of nearly 100,000 houses to let each year under the Acts of 1924 and 1930 as against 50,000-60,000 during each of the last few years.There are, therefore, reasonable grounds for hoping that local authorities may, during the next few years, provide an increased amount of accommodation at substantially lower rents than hitherto.To some extent, moreover, the pressure might be eased by the more effective use of the accommodation already provided. The suggestion has been made to us that some municipal houses are
occupied by persons for whom the assistance under the Acts for the housing of the working classes was not intended. We do not know to what extent this suggestion can be supported. We merely record it.35. The question of the part which private enterprise can play under present conditions in meeting the housing needs of the work-ing classes is more difficult. In the first place, as regards the build-ing of houses to let, private enterprise has in the local authority u subsidised competitor. The economic weekly net rent of a houst-costing  400 (all in) is about 10s. 6d.; the subsidy under the Act of 1924, plus the usual rate contribution, is equivalent to more than 4s. a week, bringing the subsidised rent down to less than 6s. 6d.* But, apart from municipal competition, it must be remembered that the ordinary builder sells as quickly as possible in order to free his capital for further enterprise; and if the house he builds is to be let some investor must be available who is willing to hold it as a per-manent investment; before the war this function was performed by the private investor who let the property; it is now performed by the building societies whose advances are repaid by instalments. It is true, of course, that if the price of building should continue to fall and the terms of purchase be made still easier, the buying of a house by instalments would approximate more closely to the renting of a house, so far as purely financial considerations are concerned.In present circumstances it appears that the contribution of private enterprise to the solution of the housing problem will be mainly confined to continuing the building of houses for sale. During recent years rather more than 100,000 houses a year have been built by private enterprise. The latest figures (about 70,000 for the half-year ended 31st March last) suggest that the total for this year will show a large increase. In all, private enterprise has built since the war about 1,000,000 houses mostly for sale. In the early days the houses were comparatively large; as the demand for this type was satisfied the type built became steadily smaller and cheaper, and recently a considerable number have been built for sale between  500- 600. As prices still seem to be tending downward, it is possible that private enterprise may presently build even cheaper houses. Perhaps the most uncertain aspect of the housing question to-day is whether there will be a continuing demand for private enterprise to build cheaper houses for sale on a large scale.36. The foregoing paragraphs relate to the position in England and Wales. In Scotland the population has declined slightly during the last ten years, so that, as in England and Wales, the new houses must have provided a large apparent surplus available for reducing* It is true that private enterprise can claim the Exchequer subsidy pro-vided that it complies with the statutory conditions as to rent, etc. But, as normally it is not practicable to comply with these conditions unless some further subsidy is available (which in the case of a local authority is repre-sented by the rate contribution), private enterprise cannot normally satisfy the conditions and so obtain the Exchequer subsidy unless either (a) it has some fund from which it can obtain a subsidy corresponding to the rate con-tribution, or (b) it can make up the difference by more economical building.
the accumulated shortage. Nevertheless the evidence shows that, particularly in the large towns, the shortage of the lowest rented houses remains. This appears to be due partly to the same reasons as those which have been referred to as operating in England and Wales, and also to the drift of population to the large towns, and to the fact that housing conditions in Scotland before the war were generally admitted to be worse than in England and Wales.37. It is unwise to prophesy in questions of economics, but we are forced to make up our minds whether there is any prospect of early relief in the shortage of houses for letting. Our analysis shows that there are certain hopeful features. Private enterprise and the local authorities are continuing to build large numbers of houses. Moreover these houses are substantially cheaper than houses built a few years ago, and so it should be easier for working-class families to move out of their old houses into new ones, and the gap which the filtering up process has to bridge will be narrower. Further, if our recommendations are adopted, tenants of small working-class houses will be able to move from one house to another without losing security of tenure or paying an in-creased rent, and one serious obstacle to mobility will be removed. There are, therefore, good reasons for hoping that filtering-up may, during the nest few years, begin to be effective on a substantial scale. This indirect method, however, is likely to be slow in taking effect, and we think that rapid progress can only be made by the provision of as large a number of houses as possible for letting at low rents under the Housing Acts of 1924 and 1930. Even if progress is as rapid as we hope, we are satisfied that for the present and the immediate future the position in regard to working-class houses does not permit of decontrol.We have been asked by several witnesses to follow the precedents set by earlier Committees and predict a date when working-class houses should be finally decontrolled. These predictions have all been falsified by events. We recommend that the new Act should place no time limit on the control of that class of house. The question will doubtless require further consideration at a later date in the light of conditions then obtaining.38. Our conclusions from the foregoing may be summarised in four propositions :  (1) That the question of continuing control of any particular class of house must be regarded as dependent on whether the shortage of houses in that class is at an end or likely to end within a reasonable period. The shortage is both a measure of the need for control and the main barrier to its removal.While it is not desirable to retain control longer than is necessary, we cannot accept the suggestion that, regardless of the shortage, a date must be fixed for final decontrol.(2) That the statistics and the oral evidence of witnesses alike indicate that a shortage of the more expensive houses no longer exists.
(3) That the demand for the less expensive middle-class houses is rapidly being met.(4) That the shortage of the least expensive houses i.e. the real working-class houses is still in many districts acute, and we are unable to say when it will be met.V. PEOPOSED DECONTROL OF ALL HOUSES above A CERTAIN YALTJE.39. Class A houses. In the preceding paragraphs we have indicated that we are satisfied that a shortage no longer exists of the more expensive houses, which for the sake of convenience we call Class A. It follows, in our view, that such houses are no longer in need of control, and there remains the necessity to suggest the line of demarcation, above which decontrol should be recommended.40. It seems desirable and convenient, in order to give a clear picture of the problem, to discard the old three categories into which the houses have been divided by the Acts. Those categories were defined by reference to pre-war rateable values or rents, and not only have no clear relation to present values, but also lead, we have found, to widespread misunderstanding of the numbers and types of houses in each of the so-called categories. The approximate relationship between rateable values and rents is shewn in the Appendix. We propose, to make our recommendations in terms of present values, and we shall notice in passing how these recommendations are related to the old categories.41. Proposed line of demarcation above which control should cease. In our view the line, above which it is no longer necessary to continue any form of control, should be drawn at a rate-able value at April last of  45 in the Metropolitan Police District (approximately equivalent to a controlled inclusive rent ranging from 30s. to 36s. a week in the County of London and from 28s. to 34s. in the Metropolitan Police District, according to the level of the local rates) and  35 in the rest of England and Wales (approxi-mately equivalent to a controlled inclusive rent ranging from 22s. to 27s. a week, according to the level of the local rates).For Scotland we consider that the line should be drawn at the yearly value in the Valuation Roll for 1931-32 of  45.* Taking the average occupier&apos;s rates at 5s. in the  , this represents tenanfs out-goings of about  56 a year. This is somewhat lower than the minimum recommended in the case of the provinces in England, but we do not think that the relation between the standard rents in the two countries fixed by the Acts need be preserved in determining figures for the present purpose.We estimate that the effect of this proposal would be to decontrol all the old upper and almost all the old middle categories, brought under control by the Acts of 1920 and 1919 respectively, and to bring out of the scope of the Acts about 900,000 houses, of which probably more than one-third are already decontrolled.   In addi-* The yearly value in Scotland corresponds to gross value in England and Wales
tion, there are over 350,000 new houses of this class, so that of the total of about 1,250,000 houses (new and old) in this class a minority-only are still under the protection of the Acts. The continuance of control in the interests of this minority must, in our opinion, be to the detriment of the majority in that it artificially restricts the amount, and so raises the price, of the accommodation in the market, and in view of the great amount of new building in this class of house we do not think that there is any reason to anticipate that owners will be able to exact scarcity rents.VI. THE TWO CLASSES OF HOUSES TO EE RETAINEDUNDER CONTROL.42. After decontrol of this higher rented class (Class A), there still remains the bulk of the houses to be considered, and this remainder seems to us to fall into two classes, which we will call Class B and Class C. By Class B we mean the small house which is sometimes rented and sometimes owned, and is occupied at one end of the scale by the artisan and at the other end by the less well-paid members of the middle classes, and by Class C we mean the real working-class house which is almost invariably rented, and which constitutes the great majority of all the houses to be retained under control. These appear to us to constitute two distinct problems, as the shortage in Class B is being overtaken with reasonable rapidity.43. Class B houses. The evidence does not suggest that any large alterations of the law are necessary for this class. Of the houses built by private enterprise (nearly 70,000 were built in the six months ended 31st March last) a large proportion are of this type, and a large number perhaps too large a number of inuni-cipal tenants have been and are being drawn from this class of occupier. For this class of house, therefore, we consider that a gradual process of decontrol is desirable, and the present process of decontrol by possession established by the Act of 1923 appears to us on balance to be less objectionable than any other system of partial or gradual decontrol wdiich has been put before \is. We, therefore, recommend that the decontrolling pro-visions of the Act of 1923 should continue to apply to this class of house.44. Class C houses. But when we consider Class C i.e., the lower rented working-class houses we find quite a different picture; and as we are about to suggest that the system of decontrol by possession introduced by the Act of 1923 is not suitable to the con-ditions of occupation of this class of house, we may usefully consider the objects and results of the Act of 1923 in relation to each of the two classes of house.45. The Act of 1923. The objective of the decontrolling system introduced by the Act appears to have been threefold.1. To secure a return to normal conditions by a gradual method of decontrol without friction.2. To provide a stimulus to building by private enterprise.
3. To secure that houses, when they became vacant, were not held for sale in large numbers, but were re-let, even if at an increased rent.46. We think that, except in regard to lower rented working-class houses, the Act has largely achieved its objects. There has not been much friction; the Act has decontrolled, a large proportion of the middle-class houses; it has largely checked the widespread prac-tice of holding this class of house for sale when it became empty; and private enterprise is building in this range large numbers of houses.47. For the lower rented working-class houses i.e., Class C  however, we do not think that this method of decontrol has effected its object. There has been a great deal of friction and some hard-ship; only about one-eighth of the houses in this class have become decontrolled ; and the Act has not succeeded in bringing back private enterprise to this class of building. We do not think that this class of house has ever been held for sale in large numbers when empty, or is likely to be, and in this we are supported by the testimony of a most experienced witness the Valuer to the London County Council.48. Further criticisms of the provisions for decontrol have been made by different witnesses. It has been said that some land-lords have been unable to resist the temptations which the system puts in their way. It is clear that the rents charged on decontrol are in some cases very high. Moreover, as we have already stated, the system has an immobilising effect on working-class tenants. This is a point to which we attach the greatest importance, not merely because of its effect in impeding the post-war housing policy, but also, from a broader point of view, on account of its effect on the national industrial economy. Any factor which decreases mobility is, in our view, bad, and if it cannot be justified on other grounds should be abandoned. We have given our reasons for thinking that this partial system of decontrol should cease to apply to the lower rented working-class houses, and we recommend accordingly.49. Proposed line of demarcation between the two new classes of controlled houses. We have now suggested the de-control of all houses above a certain line (Class A), and the division of the houses which remain into two classes, Class 13 houses which should continue to be subject to the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923, and Class C houses for which we propose a stricter control. There remains the necessity to draw a line between the Class B house and the Class C house, i.e., to differen-tiate the real working-class house. We have considered this matter very carefully and have come to the conclusion that the best line to recommend is the line which is already known as the line of the compounding limits, i.e., the limits of rateable value below which a local authority can require the owners of houses to be liable for the rates on the houses. The proportion of small houses falling within these limits will, of course, vary from district to district according partly to the character of the district and partly to the level of local
assessments; but for the country as a whole this line of demarcation appears to us to afford the best rough definition of real work-ing-class houses. It will be recalled that the limits of value are  20 current rateable value in London (approximately equivalent to a current controlled inclusive weekly rent ranging from 14s. to 17s. in the County of London and from 13s. to 16s. in the Metropolitan Police District according to the level of the local rates),  13 in the provinces (approximately equivalent to a current controlled inclusive weekly rent ranging from about 9s. 6d. to 11s. 6d. according to the level of the local rates), and in Scotland a figure which varies according to the size of the burgh or special district (see the note on paragraph 20).The compounding limit for the Metropolitan Police District out-side the Administrative County of London is only  13, as in the rest of England and &quot;Wales. We think that the figure of  20, which is the figure for the Administrative County, should be taken for this purpose as the figure for the whole of the Metropolitan Police District.It should also be observed that (as pointed out in the note on paragraph 20) Liverpool has a special compounding limit of  16 5s. We think that, for this purpose, the figure of  13, which applies to the rest of England and Wales except London, should apply also to Liverpool.In Scotland the compounding limits vary widely according to the population of the burgh or special district-so widely that they can only be a rough indication of the variation according to locality of the rents paid by the occupiers of working-class houses. Further, they do not apply in burghs having a population of less than 10,000, or in special districts in which the Act of 1911 referred to below has not been adopted, or in landward parts of the county not included in special districts. For these reasons we recommend that a uniform figure of yearly value should be adopted in Scotland representing the total amount paid in rent, and that the figure should be the maximum compounding limit, namely,  26 5s. a year. To give effect to this recommendation provision would require to be made that there shmild be included in Class C :  (a) Every controlled house to which the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1911, applies; and(b) Every other controlled house of which the yearly vahie on 16th May, 1931, did not exceed  26 5s.50. The summary of these proposals will be found in recommenda-tions 1 and 2 in the Summary of Recommendations, page 56.VII. MORTGAGES.51. The evidence has been conflicting on the question whether the control of mortgages should continue as long as the control of rents. The witnesses representing the Law Society have asked us, as they asked previous Committees, to recommend that mortgagees should be set at liberty to call in their mortgages notwithstanding that the
mortgaged property still remained under control; and in particular our attention has been directed to the special difficulties caused by the Acts to executors and to those who have to administer private trusts, and to the hardships which frequently arise because the closing of such trusts and the realisation of estates are hampered or prevented.52. In considering this question, the fact must be taken into account that much of the property in question is old and some of it very old, and we cannot share the view which was put to us by such witnesses that the mortgagors would experience no serious diffi-culty in reborrowing at a reasonable rate of interest. We share the view of the witnesses who urged adherence to the policy hitherto followed, that those who borrowed on a free security should not be made liable to be compelled to reborrow on a controlled security for the purpose of repaying the loan; in other words, we consider that the control on a mortgage should continue as long as the rent of the mortgaged property is controlled. If, however, our recommendation that all the more expensive houses should immediately be decon-trolled is adopted, it will follow (subject to what is said below) that so far as these houses are concerned mortgagees will be freed from Control.53. It has been suggested that in the case of these houses some further protection for the mortgagor is necessary. This suggestion came principally from witnesses from Scotland. We think that in both countries a further short period of protection for the mortgagor should be allowed in order to mitigate any possible hardship, and we recommend that the provisions of the Acts relating to mortgages should remain in force for a further six months after the date for de-control of houses in Class A.VIII. DECONTROLLED HOUSES.. 54. We have already, in paragraphs 22 to 25, given our estimate of the number of decontrolled houses in different categories of value. We have also pointed out that, while a large proportion of the more expiMisive houses have become decontrolled, we have clear evidence from the Ministry of Labour&apos;s statistics that only about one-eighth of the working-class houses have come out of control.55. We have recommended that the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should cease to apply in future to the small working-class houses i.e., the class which we have called Class C, but should continue to apply as hitherto to the other houses to be left under control i.e., the class which we have called Class B. If this recommendation is adopted the position of a decontrolled house will bo different according to whether it belongs to Class B or Class C. In Class B the number of decontrolled houses will increase; in Class C, however, the houses already decontrolled will remain in a minority of about one-eighth, as they will not be increasing. In these circum-stances we have considered carefully the suggestion which has been
put forward by some witnesses that decontrolled working-class houses should be brought back under control, but we have come to the con-: elusion that the proposal cannot be supported, and that it would-create as many anomalies as it would cure.56. in the first place, it would be open to the general objections to which all retrospective legislation is open and which need no emphasis.   secondly, it would be logically difficult to stop at recon-tioiling old houses; the same reasoning would lead to the control of new houses never hitherto controlled.     tor the anomaly of the present situation consists in the different rents charged for the two classes of houses which to-day co-exist the controlled and the tin-controlled the uncontrolled class including both the pre-war houses which have become decontrolled and the new post-war houses which&apos; have never been under control.   to bring under control one section&apos; of the uncontrolled houses but not the other would again leave two &apos; classes and the same anomaly.   for these reasons we fear that the psychological effect of the proposal, if adopted, would be to shake the confidence of private capital and private enterprise in the building&apos; industry; and so, on a long view, would do more damage, in our&apos; opinion, to the good hotising of the working classes than would be   compensated   for   by   any   immediate   benefit   which   it might   confer   on   the   relatively   small   proportion   of   present&apos; tenants  who   would   be   affected.    the   proposal, moreover, in addition   to   deterring   private enterprise   from   the   type   of building which it at present undertakes, and so increasing unemployment-ployment in the building industry, might also have the effect of closing the door finally on the hope that private enterprise may pre-sently return to the building of working-class houses.57. apart from these objections, the proposal would in many cases strike at the wrong person. decontrolled houses have fre-quently changed hands at rents or prices which, ex hypothesi, are high. to bring them now again under any form of control would he immediately to reduce their market value. in such a case the damage would be suffered by the person who had already paid a high price or rent to obtain the property.58. these difficulties were appreciated by most of the witnesses appearing on behalf of the tenants, who suggested the recontrol of decontrolled houses, and who were, in some instances, disposed to withdraw their suggestion when the difficulties were brought out in discussion. the principal request to which they adhered was that the system of decontrol by vacant possession should not be allowed in the future to apply to real working-class houses. this recom-mendation we have made, but, for the reasons which we have given, we are unable to make any recommendations in regard to houses already decontrolled.ix. the permitted increase of rent.59. we have been asked to recommend a reduction in rent on the grounds, among others, that since the present increase of 40 per cent, in rent was first permitted wages have fallen and unemployment has:
increased, and that in consequence in many parts of the country the tenants&apos; ability to pay their rent has been greatly reduced. On the other hand, according to the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures, the average increase in wages rates among persons in employment is greater than the increase in controlled inclusive rents. In our view neither of these considerations is strictly relevant to the question which it is our duty to consider. The Acts which we are examining merely fix the maximum which can be recovered by the owners; that is to say, their object and effect is not to guarantee the owners an income but to restrict their legal power to obtain as much money as they otherwise could from their houses. If in any area tenants are unable to pay even the restricted rents owing to unemployment or industrial depression, then the permitted increases will not always be obtainable and will be in practice what they were always intended to be and legally are, namely, maximum increases. Moreover, we have received evidence which shows that to-day in certain districts in the West of Scotland owners do, in fact, find great difficulty in obtaining the maximum rents per-mitted by law. The basis on which the increase was arrived at was carefully explained in the Report of the Salisbury Committee. It first took account of the increased cost of the necessary otitgoings of the landlord, and then allowed him a limited increase of interest on his capital. We do not consider that we could properly recommend any alteration in the total increase unless on examination anjr of the figures which make up the total should appear to be too high or too low, having regard to any change in the factors which were taken into account in their calculation. We accordingly examined these factors with great care. It will be recalled that a total increase of 40 per cent, on the pre-war net rent was allowed, and was made up as follows :  25 per cent, of the pre-war net rent for increased cost of repairs.10 per cent, of the pre-war net rent for increased mortgage interest.5 per cent, of the pre-war net rent for increased yield on the owner&apos;s own capital.60. As regards the 15 per cent, permitted for increased interest, either to the mortgagee or to the owner himself, it is difficult to see how there could reasonably be any alteration so long as the owners still have to pay the mortgagees their increased interest, and we have received no evidence justifying&apos; any alteration of this increase.61. The position is different with regard to the 25 per cent, increase which was associated with the increased cost of repairs. It is well known that there has been a substantial fall in prices of build-ing materials and labour costs, and this has been urged as an additional reason for a reduction in the present increase. Our in-vestigations into this matter, however, suggest that an alteration would not be jiistified.62. It will be remembered that the Salisbury Committee assumed for the basis of their calculations that the average annual cost of the repairs to a house before the war was one-sixth of the net rent; they
found that the cost of repairs in 1920 had risen by about 150 per cent.; and they accordingly recommended that there should be a permitted: increase of 25 per cent. (i.e.,  th of 150 per cent.) of the pre-war net rent to meet the extra cost.We have examined both factors in this calculation.63. When the Salisbury Committee took the first factor as one-sixth, they were considering the whole range of houses, includ-ing not only the smaller houses (which are the only houses that we propose should be retained under control) but also the larger houses which we propose should now be decontrolled. That Commit-tee, therefore, took a rough average figure for all these houses. It is, however, common knowledge that in the smaller houses, which we propose should be retained under control, the cost of repairs represents a much larger proportion of the rent than in the larger houses. The Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, recog-recognises this fact, and the fixed deductions under that Act (which take the place of allowances for repairs) vary from two-fifths for the smallest houses to one-fifth for large houses. These allowances, if regarded as solely for repairs, seem to be somewhat too high for the present purpose, and we think that the correct proportion for the smallest houses was about one-fourth; and this view is supported by evidence which we have received from the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution and other witnesses.64. The second factor to be considered is the amount of the increase in the cost of repairs over the pre-war cost. We find that the present increased cost of repairs is of the order of 80 per cent.-100 per cent, above the cost in 1914. This conclusion is based on the oral evidence of witnesses representing the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution, the Sanitary Inspectors&apos; Association, the London County Council and the Glasgow Property Owners&apos; Association, and on written statements supplied by Government Departments in regard to labour costs in 1914, 1920 and 1930, and estimated costs of typical cottage repair works in the same years. Taking the pre-war cost of repairs at 100, we find that the comparative cost at various dates was approximately:  In 1914............100In 1920 ............   250-280In 1930 ............   180-20065. On the basis of these figures, and making allowance for the higher standard of repairs now usually required and the fact that the houses are now 17 years older, the cost of doing repairs to working-class houses is now about twice what it was in 1914 i.e., it i^ about 50 per cent, of the pre-war net rent. It follows that there is no case on these figures for altering the permitted increase of 25 per cent.These figures support the owners&apos; contention that in the past, for the smaller properties at least, the 25 per cent, increase permitted by the Acts has not been sufficient to enable repairs to be carried out on the same scale as before the war. Indeed, several witnesses indicated that repairs had not, in fact, been carried out because the allowance
for repairs was insivfficient for this class of property. It is, how-ever, clear that the permitted increase, though not excessive, is now, owing to the fall in costs, sufficient to enable a conscientious land-lord to carry out all necessary repairs on an adequate scale. The Reports of the previous Committees leave no room for doubt that the 25 per cent, increase was expressly awarded for this purpose, and, in our view, a tenant has a right to expect that his landlord will do his duty in this respect.X. ENFORCEMENT OF REPAIRS.66. While, therefore, we make no recommendations for altering the permitted increase, we are satisfied that owners can no longer claim that the permitted increase is not adequate for its purpose. The evidence which we have received, however, shows that in many districts repairs are not being adequately carried out, although the law. provides ample machinery of a varied character for securing that they should be. We feel strongly that every practicable step ought to be taken to see that repairs are properly carried out.67. Reference has already been made in paragraph 13 to the machinery which the Rent Restrictions Acts provide for the obtain-in g of a certificate from the sanitary authority that a house is not in a reasonable state of repair and the withholding of the whole 40 per cent, increase until the repairs are done. This machinery does not appear to be widely known or used. We have been told that most tenants either do not know of or are afraid to use this weapon even in cases where it could hardly have failed to succeed. For example, we were informed that in Manchester in ten years only about 200 certificates had been applied for, although each year about 2,000-4,000 notices were served under the Housing and other Acts, and in nearly all these cases a certificate would have been granted if application had been made.68. We are impressed by the elaborate statutory and adminis-trative machinery which already exists under the Housing, Public Health and Rent Restrictions Acts for securing that repairs are carried out, and we appreciate that the reasons why that machinery has not worked with greater success are likely to be difficult to cure by any suggestions which we may make at this stage for amending the law or its administration. These reasons seem to be, first, the ignorance or fear of the tenant to use the machinery of the Rent Restriction Acts, and secondly, the inadequacy of the staff of some local authorities to carry out a sufficient number of inspections in their districts.69. Suggestions examined. Various suggestions have been made to us for improving the position, but on examination have appeared either to be impracticable or likely to be ineffective.One suggestion which we have examined with special attention is that the onus of obtaining the certificate should be shifted from the tenant to the owner, and that after a certain date it should be unlawful for the owner to continue to charge the 25 per cent, increase permitted for repairs unless he had obtained a certificate
from the local authority that the house was in good and tenantable repair. The suggestion is not a new one. The Hunter Committee in 1919, in recommending certain increases of rent, made it a con-dition of their recommendation that the owner should have obtained a certificate from the local authority. They recognised that the recommendation involved more work and staff for the local authorities, but they pointed out that the local authorities had already the duty of seeing that a proper standard of housing was maintained, and where this duty was being efficiently performed the extra work would not be great; in other cases, they thought that their proposal might act as a useful stimulus. This proposal was not adopted; and, although we appreciated that the practical objec-tions to it were considerable, we invited the views of those associa-tions of local authorities who sent witnesses before us.The official views of the Association of Municipal Corporations, the County Councils Association in Scotland and the Convention of Royal Burghs were opposed to the suggestion, and in face of this evidence as to the difficulties which wotdd be catised to local authorities we should be very reluctant to recommend this alteration of the law. Moreover, we feel that there are other diffi-culties associated with the proposal. In particular we are not satisfied that it wrould be altogether to the advantage of the tenant, who might be disposed to think that he had no further remedies at law against his landlord when the landlord held the certificate of the local authority^. It must be remembered that in many areas such certificates might be granted freely, merely because time and staff did not admit of an adequate inspection of every working-class house in the district. Moreover, even if the initial difficulty of making the first inspections could be surmounted, it would still be necessary for all certificates to be renewed at sufficiently frequent intervals. For these reasons we feel unable to recommend this proposal.70. Decorations. It is necessary to mention one aspect of the question of repairs to which several witnesses have attached import-ance, namely, the definition of &quot; repairs &quot; and the question wjhether it included or should include decorations. There are different stan-dards of repairs under the Rent Restrictions Acts, the Housing and Public Health Acts and certain local Acts. Much the strictest standard known to the general law is that of the Rent Restrictions Acts which speak of &quot; good and tenantable repair.&quot; This wording as interpreted by the Courts* appears to require decoration where it would be usual and ctistomary; and we do not think that any further provision than this would be appropriate in Acts, the object and effect of which is to limit the power of owners to exact the market rent of their properties.*It was decided in Proudfoot v. Hart (1890) [25 Q.B.D. 42 at p. 51] that a covenant in a lease to keep promises in good and tenantablc repair means to keep thorn in such repair as, having regard to the age, character and locality of the house, would make it reasonably fit for the occupation of a reasonably minded tenant of the class who would be likely to take it. Further discussion of the words &quot; good and tenantablc repair &quot; contained in a covenant in a lease occurs in Anslruther-Gouqh-Callliorpc v. McOscar (1924) [1 K.B. 716].
It has been suggested to us, however, that some local authorities in granting a certificate under the Rent Restrictions Acts base their requirements on the less stringent standard of the Public Health Acts, presumably because they prefer not to include in the certificate requirements which they could not themselves enforce under the Public Health Acts. This practice, whatever administrative con-venience it may have, is at variance with the Rent Restrictions Acts and should be discontinued.71, Recommendations. -Without any amendment of the law the tenant, as we have pointed out, already has the remedy in his own hands if he will show a little more courage in using it. We think that the local advisory committees of local authorities referred to in paragraph 99, local associations of tenants and other similar bodies could do much useful work in spreading information as to the law, and in strengthening the hands of tenants who desire to avail theni-selves of it.In this connection we think that the statutory Notice of Increase should be simplified and amended particularly in relation to the note thereon concerning repairs; and that Rent Books where used should follow a common form and should include the simplified and amended note.Pressure should also be brought by the local authorities to secure the execution of repairs. As we have already pointed out, they have ample powers for this purpose under the Public Health and Housing Acts. We think, moreover, that many owners of property would welcome further pressure being brought to bear on those owners who do not carry out their duty.XI. POSSESSION.72. The present law as to the circumstances in which an owner can recover possession of a controlled property is outlined in paragraph 15.73. We have received strong evidence from many quarters in regard to the difficulty of obtaining possession under the existing law with the result that public improvements and commercial, in-dustrial and housing developments are sometimes hindered or even entirely prevented. It is urged that the grounds on which possession can be claimed and the definition of alternative accommodation are too narrow.74. Alternative Accommodation. Alternative accommoda-tion is defined in the Acts as accommodation which is&quot; Reasonably suitable to the means of the tenant and to the needs of the tenant and his family as regards extent, character, and proximity to place of work and which consists either of a dwelling house to which this Act applies or of premises to be let as a separate dwelling on terms which will afford to the tenant security of tenure reasonably equivalent to the security afforded by this Act in the case of a dwelling house to which this Act applies.&quot;
*e.g., an arrangement whereby the landlord of the house which is the alternative accommodation agrees that the tenant shall hold the house on the same terms as to security of tenure as if the house were controlled and the tenant were a statutory tenant. Such arrangements are made under the present law as a condition of the granting of an order for possession.The most difficult condition in the definition to satisfy is that the alternative accommodation should afford reasonably similar security of tenure to that of a controlled house. Owing to the fact that in nearly every instance a vacant house has been automatically decon-trolled under the provisions of the Act of 1923, and has consequently not been normally available as alternative accommodation within the definition, the supply of alternative accommodation complying with the definition has been almost non-existent. If our recommen-dation that there shall be no further decontrol of Class C houses by possession is adopted, so that such houses although vacant remain controlled, any new tenant will have the benefit of the controlled rent and of the security of tenure under the Acts: and so it will be considerably easier for landlords to show the existence of alternative accommodation in this class of house.This is the chief reason why we do not propose to recommend any substantial relaxations of the definition. At the same time we think that it ought to be extended in certain directions. It ought, in our opinion, specifically to in chide a house provided by the local authority, and, if the conditions as to security of tenure* are satis-fied, a house which although not actually provided by the local authority is certified by that authority to be similar to the houses so provided in accommodation and rent.75. In some cases the local authority may be willing, in return for a sufficient contribution from the landlord, to undertake the pro-vision of the new alternative accommodation. There are cases, especially where controlled working class property occupies valuable sites, in which the redevelopment of a whole area may be prevented by the owner&apos;s inability to obtain vacant possession. In such cir-cumstances it might be possible to rehouse the tenants in flats on part of the site, and so make the rest available for other develop-ment. Thus the tenants would obtain new accommodation for old, the owners would receive the profits of redevelopment and the local authority the benefit of increased rateable value. Such a solution is at present, however, hindered, first, by the Rent Restrictions Acts, which prevent the owners from obtaining vacant possession, and, secondly, by the fact that it is not usually worth the while or within the means of the owner to provide the whole cost of rehousings though he might be quite willing to contribute part. AVe have had brought to our attention, and have seen for ourselves, an interesting illustration of this problem and its solution in the Millbank Im-provement Area, where an important work of redevelopment is being carried out by the Westminster City Council with the assistance of the Duke of Westminster. This scheme would be impossible without the special powers obtained by the City Council in a private
Act of 1929. We consider that schemes of this kind (they would normally, of course, be on a much smaller scale) ought to be possible without the necessity of obtaining special Parliamentary powers. A certificate from the local housing authority that they had under-taken to provide the necessary alternative accommodation ought to be sufficient evidence that the interests of the tenants had been safeguarded, and that adequate! alternative accommodation was available.76. There is one other way in which we think that the definition should be extended. As it stands at present the Court can only consider accommodation which is available at the time the applica-tion for possession is before it. This has led to hardships in many cases, and we think that the Court should be able to take into account accommodation which it is satisfied would be available when any Order for possession became effective.77. Proposed new grounds for claiming Possession. Much of the complexity of the present law is due to the fact that, broadly speaking, it regards not merely the question whether alternative accommodation is available, but also the reason why the landlord wants possession of his own house. If there is to be a list of such reasons, as at present, then we think that it certainly ought to be extended so as to include, for example, the carrying out of desirable housing, industrial or commercial developments. We do not, however, consider the extension of the -present list to be the proper method of dealing with the problem. It appears to us that Parlia-ment should not concern itself with the reason why tho landlord wants his own house if it is sure that the interests of the tenant are secured by providing that the landlord must satisfy the Court that alternative accommodation for the tenant is available and, as in all such cases, that it is reasonable that the tenant should move. We think, therefore, that the law should be simplified so as to provide that wherever alternative accommodation is available the landlord shall be entitled to apply for possession, retaining, of noxirse, the discretion of the Court to consider the general reason-ableness of the application, having regard to the circumstances both of the landlord and the tenant.We desire to point out that, if this suggestion is adopted, the extent to which the power will be used will depend primarily on the amount of suitable accommodation available in any given district. Thus, the greater the amount of suitable accommodation available in an)T district, the smaller will be the difficulty which owners will experience in obtaining possession of their houses. So, in effect, the law would recognise, what is an undoubted fact, that the housing shortage varies in degree in different localities.78. There remain certain special grounds on which the law at present permits a landlord to apply for possession although alterna-tive accommodation is not available. The chief of these have already been described in paragraph 15. We do not make any recommendations for altering the law in regard to these cases.
79. There are, however, two special cases which require separate consideration houses let to persons in consequence of their em-ployment and owners who want possession for their own occupation.80. Houses let to persons in consequence of their employ-ment. One large class of such houses, those occupied by agricultural workers, are specifically excluded from our terms of reference. As regards the remainder, which fall within our terms of reference  e.g., those provided by large industrial companies, railways, etc., for their workers, we do not desire to recommend any alteration of the existing law. In effect, before the Act of 1923, the control exercised by the Rent Restrictions Acts was a control of rent only, the security of tenure enjoyed by the tenant being dependent on his tenure of employment. Since the Act of 1923 such houses of this class as became vacant have, of course, become decontrolled; but, according to the evidence we received from the Ministry of Labour as the result of special inquiries carried out at our request, the effect in most cases has not been to lead to any change in the rent charged, or in other conditions. This might have been expected, because a large company housing numerous employees of the same status will naturally treat its workpeople alike in regard to rent and housing conditions irrespective of the accident of control or decontrol of a particular house.81. Owners who want Possession for their own occupation. The case of the owner who desires possession for his own occupation has not been much emphasised by the witnesses whom we have heard, partly, perhaps, because many such owners do not belong to any representative association, but a large proportion of the letters which we have received from private individuals has come from such owners. As the law stands at present an owner, in claiming pos-session for himself or his son or daughter aged over 18, must either show, under the principal Act, that alternative accommodation is available for the tenant, or, under the Prevention of Eviction Act, 1924, that greater hardship would be caused by the refusing of the Order for possession than by the granting of it. This second alter-native, however, is not open to anyone who became an owner by purchase after May 5th, 1924. The purpose of this limitation was both to prevent large, numbers of people buying occupied houses in order to take advantage of the special provisions, and also to en-courage such potential owner-occupiers to purchase new houses instead. We think that the benefit of the Act might now be extended to those who have bought houses for their own occupation since 1924, and we, therefore, recommend that the date of this Report might now be substituted for May 5th, 1924, in Section 1 of the Prevention of Eviction Act, 1924.This amendment should go some way in assisting those among such owners who most deserve assistance namely, those who can prove that it is a greater hardship for them to be deprived of their own house than it is to make the tenant find other accommodation.
XII. FURNISHED LETTINGS.82. Furnished lettings are, broadly speaking, outside the Acts, and tenants of such lettings can be dispossessed in the ordinary way when their tenancies expire. Sections 9 and 10 of the principal Act, however, impose a penalty for charging an extortionate rent for such lettings. The reasons why such lettings are not controlled qua possession were clearly stated in the Report of the Salisbury Com-mittee (paragraph 19) :  &quot; It would not be possible in the case of furnished lettings simply to forbid eviction. To compel a landlord to allow lodgers to continue to reside in the house where he is living, who for some reason or other are objectionable to him, would create great friction and injustice. Again, where the whole house is let furnished for a month or two, it would be an alarming result if the tenant was entitled to remain for some two or three years. Further, eviction from furnished rooms is not so serious a matter to a tenant as in the case of unfurnished lettings. We are, therefore, not prepared to recommend the extension of the protection against eviction to furnished lettings.&quot;All that we need add to this clear statement of the case is that probably a large majority of furnished lettings are provided for persons, as e.g., holiday makers, whose stay is temporary, and for whom security of tenure is not a factor to be considered at all.S3. Furnished Rooms. We have received a certain amount of evidence of profiteering in the letting of furnished rooms. Such profiteering as exists appears to be limited mainly to congested areas. The furnished rooms for vvhich excessive rents are demanded may be in controlled houses or decontrolled houses or new houses; the question of control or decontrol apparently has little to do w7ith it. It is no doubt for this reason that the solution which was suggested to us had no connection with the Rent Restrictions Acts, but was a proposal that local authorities should be empowered to apply to the County Court to fix the rent of furnished rooms. The proposal makes no attempt to face the difficulties of the problem, which may be briefly stated as follows :  (a) It would be almost impossible to formulate satisfactoryrules for guidance of the Court in settling a reasonable rent. (6) Control of rent without protection from eviction would inour view be ineffective (and the reasons why protection fromeviction cannot be given have already been indicated in the last paragraph).(c) It would frequently be impossible to distinguish between a lodger and a tenant of furnished rooms. The proposal followed the lines of a clause in a recent Birming-ham Corporation Bill.   The clause was rejected by Parliament, and the Committee feel unable to recommend the proposal.
84. We think, however, that the position as regards furnished rooms in controlled houses may be considerably eased by the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Fordree v. Barrett, which has now made it clear that where a statutory tenant sub-lets rooms furnished he creates against himself new dwelling houses out-side the scope of the Acts, and the landlord is entitled to an order for possession of the rooms so sub-let. We think it probable that the effect of this decision will be to reduce considerably the scope of the problem by discouraging statutory tenants from this form of sub-letting.If our recommendation that there should be no further decontrol by possession in the case of working-class houses is adopted, the land-lord would not be able to raise the rent of the rooms, if he re-let them unfurnished, and the new tenant would have the advantage of the security of tenure afforded by the Acts. The decision, moreover, shordd help to mitigate overcrowding of the whole house by restoring to the landlord some control over his property.XIII. SUB-LETTING- OF UNFURNISHED ROOMS.85. Present Law. Before discussing this difficult question it seems desirable to define our terms and to state in bare outline what the law at present provides. We have found much misunderstanding and confusion in the minds of witnesses in regard to what precisely is meant by sub-letting. Sub-letting may, of course, be either of a whole house or of only part; similarly, letting may be of part of a house or of the whole. As sub-letting of the whole house without the consent of the landlord enables the landlord under the Acts to claim possession, we are principally concerned with the sub-letting of parts of houses. The tenant who has so sub-let is regarded by the Acts as standing in the relation of landlord to the sub-tenant, and the part sub-let is a dwelling house within the meaning of the Acts. The sub-tenant is protected against the landlord as well as against the tenant.o ........In the absence of an express prohibition in his original agree-ment, if any, the statutory tenant has the right to sub-let part of the house without obtaining the landlords consent. The rent charge-able by the tenant to the sub-tenant may, under section 12 (3) of the principal Act, be determined on the application of either party by an Order of the County Court* apportioning the amount of the standard rent of the comprising dwelling-house which is applicable to the part sub-let.86. Section Y of the Act of 1923, which followed one of the recommendations of the Onslow Committee, recognises two principles first, that the sub-tenant may be expected to pay a* It will be appreciated that the question of apportionment arises only in the case where the first sub-letting occurred after the date when the house was first controlled. If, for example, sub-letting existed in 1914, the standard rent of the part sub-let is the rent charged in 1914, and may, in an extreme case, exceed the rent of the whole house.
rent on a slightly higher basis than the tenant, and, secondly, that the landlord is entitled to an increased return on account of the in-creased wear and tear of the property. Accordingly the section allows a tenant who has lawfully sub-let a part of a house to charge the sub-tenant an additional 10 per cent, of the net rent of the part sub-let, and the landlord to increase the rent of the tenant by 5 per cent, of the net rent of the part sub-let (the effect is that the tenant and the landlord each get half the extra money). The sec-tion also provides that the tenant who has sub-let must, under penalty, supply the landlord, on request, with full information of the sub-letting.87. Abuses of unregulated Sub-letting. We have received a large amount of evidence in regard to this question, which is one of the few on which nearly all our witnesses have agreed. It has been represented to us that some statutory tenants exact excessive rents from their sub-tenants; that their sub-tenants, either from ignorance or fear, do not tise the power which the Acts give them to apply for an apportionment order, and that the landlord finds his property overcrowded without his knowledge or consent, and ;s deprived by Parliament of any effective remedy, no matter what damage may be caused to his property or his purse by the profiteer-ing activities of the tenant who is himself completely protected by Parliament.88. We are of opinion that there is substance in all these corn-plaints, and we have carefully examined, with the assistance of a special Sub-Committee which we appointed from our number to go into the question, the various remedies which have been propounded to us. It will be appreciated that the problems are as old as the Rent Restrictions Acts, and many of the solutions suggested to us have been previously examined and rejected by earlier Committees.89. Suggestions made by witnesses. A number of witnesses have taken the line that the proper person to control sub-letting, and the evils such as overcrowding which they point to as flowing from it, is the landlord, and they have made various suggestions with this general object. Another suggestion was that every tenant should be required to register with the local authority the fact that he was sub-letting a part of the premises and the amount of rent which he was charging the sub-tenant. It was further suggested that the local authority might be empowered on the application of the sub-tenant to apply to the Court on behalf of the sub-tenant for an apportionment order.90. Several suggestions for minor amendments of the Acts in regard to sub-letting were made to us. Some of these would no doubt effect an improvement, but, for reasons which we give in para-graph 107, we are not prepared to recommend any changes in the law unless we are satisfied that they are essential to remedy some real injustice.91. In considering the several proposals which have been put before us, we have borne in mind the consideration which influenced
previous Committees that it would be worse thau useless to suggest a remedy that would have the effect of drastically restricting sub-letting. So long as a housing shortage remains it is manifest that sub-letting will and should continue. What is needed is some prac-iicable system of regulating it without causing injustice to the parties concerned. For this reason we agree with the Onslow Com-uiittee (paragraph 12 of their Report), in declining to accept the proposal that no sub-letting should be permitted except with the consent of the landlord. To make the landlord the sole Judge whether his property is to be sub-let would, under present conditions, lead to a too drastic restriction of the practice of sub-letting; and we think that the proposal would remain open to objection even if an appeal to the Court against the landlords refusal were permitted.92. We have carefully considered the proposal for a system of registration with the local authority, but are unable to recommend it. It would involve a great deal of work, and would, we think, cause much public resentment. Many tenants sub-let because they are obliged by poverty to do so, and they would resent being required to advertise this fact to the local authority. The chief merit of the proposal, which, as we have said, we are unable to recommend, would lie in its psychological effect, and the proposal which we are about to make that the tenant be required to inform the landlord of the fact and amount of any sub-letting would, we think, have perhaps a greater effect, without being open to some of the objections of the other proposal.93. That the local authority should be empowered, on application by a sub-tenant, to apply on his behalf to the Court for an appor-tionment order is a proposal which is open to obvious objection. It would place on the local authority the duty of determining, on the application of a sub-tenant, whether the premises were controlled, whether they were lawfully sub-let, and whether the rent charged exceeded the permitted rent;. Unless there had previously been an apportionment order in respect of the part sub-let, the local authority would have to decide in their own minds what the apportionment ought to be, and then, if their apportionment was not accepted by the tenant, to take the matter for decision to the Coxirt. Thus a new and inappropriate function of a judicial character would be placed on the local authorities. Moreover, in our view, the proposal would be largely ineffective. As we have said, the main reason why the sub-tenant does not at present make use of the remedy which the law provides is that he fears the resentment of the tenant, who is his landlord. This resentment is not likely to be the less if the sub-tenant not only invokes the power of the Court, but also invites the interference of the local authority. We are aware that powers of this character, but of much wider scope, were sought but not obtained by the Corporation of Birmingham in a recent Bill, to which we have already referred in paragraph 83. We have examined the proposal with care and considerable sympathy, but for the reasons we have given we are unable to recommend it.
94. some of the evidence which we have received has related to the sub-letting of parts of decontrolled houses. as, for the reasons given in paragraphs 55-58, we feel unable to propose any recontrol of the letting of decontrolled houses, it follows that we are unable to make any recommendations in regard to the sub-letting of parts of such houses. further, as has already been pointed out, the pro-portion of decontrolled working-class houses is small (only about one-eighth of the total of such houses).95. recommendations. we, therefore, limit our proposals to sub-letting of parts of controlled houses, and in regard to these we do not think that any elaborate proposals would be effective or be under-stood by the persons affected. what we propose are the following simple alterations to the law, which should apply to all existing as well as to future sub-lettings, and which, we think, will go a long-way towards improving the position :  (1) In case of extortionate charging  by statutory tenant landlord to have right to apply for possession.we agree with the suggestion that was made to us that, in an extreme case, a statutory tenant who is abusing his privileged position by charging an extortionate rent from the sub-tenant should be placed in peril of losing his privileged position; and we agree with those witnesses who have said that the landlord is the appropriate person to take action. we, therefore, recommend that a landlord should be empowered to apply to the court for the possession of the whole or part of a tenanfs interest in the comprising dwelling house on the ground that the tenant is charging an extortionate rent to a sub-tenant, and if the court is satisfied of the truth of the complaint it should be empowered at its discretion either to make an order for possession accordingly, and fix the rent payable by the sub-tenant to the landlord, from wihom he would in future hold direct, or to fix the rent to be paid in future to the tenant if the court does not make an order for possession against him.(2) Statutory tenants to notify landlords if they are sub-letting.we think that, from a psychological point of view, much good might result if the statutory tenant who is sub-letting were required, under penalty, to inform the landlord, without being requested to do so, of the rent which he is charging the sub-tenant, and the landlord would then, under our first suggestion, be empowered, if the sub-rent appeared extortionate, to apply to the court for possession of the tenant&apos;s interest. on any change of sub-tenancy there should be no need to notify the landlord unless there was some change in the rent or other conditions of the sub-tenancy.effect could be given to this proposal by an amendment of section 7 (2) of the act of 1923. it would, of course, be necessary to bring this provision to the notice of the tenant, either by a note in the rent book or by some other simple means.(3) Penalty in certain cases for extortionate charges to sub-tenants.
XIV. RENT COURTS.97. The post-war housing shortage led in many countries to legis-lation restricting rents. This legislation naturally took different shape in different places, but usually it took either one or other of two quite distinct forms. In some countries, as, for example, in Den-mark, special Rent Boards or Rent Courts were set up for the purpose of ratifying rent contracts and determining disputes between land-lords and tenants; in others, as in Great Britain, the central legisla-ture decided for the whole country, or for specified parts of it, the legal rent which might be charged, and disputes were left to be settled by ordinary process of law. There is clearly an essential difference between the two systems. Under one system fair rents are settled according to individual circumstances by special Courts; under the other rents have to conform to a nationally enacted standard, the jurisdiction of the Courts being confined to matters of interpretation and the determination of such questions as the grant-ing of possession, etc.*i.e., a maximum fine of  100.We think that in certain cases a tenant who sub-lets at an extor-tionate rent should be liable to a penalty; and that this liability must be limited to cases in which the tenant can reasonably be expected to know what is the permissible rent for the sub-letting, i.e., to cases where the Court has apportioned the rent of the comprising dwelling-house. We, therefore, recommend that in any case where some or all of the rooms sub-let have been the subject of an apportionment order it shall be an offence for a tenant to charge a sub-tenant a rent which is extortionate, having regard to all the circumstances of the case; and in such a case the like penalty* should ensue and the Court should have the like powers as in the case of excessive charges for furnished lettings under section 10 of the principal Act.An amendment of section 10 of the principal Act would give effect to this suggestion.(4) Power to local authorities to set up Committees to give information and advice.We have already indicated that much of the difficulty in regard to the enforcement of the existing law on this subject is due to ignorance. The committees, which in paragraph 99 we recom-mend local authorities should be empowered to set up, should be able to assist in this respect.96. We have given a great deal of thought and attention to this aspect of our enquiry, but we do not think that there is any short cut to a solution of the difficulties, which are inherent in the present system of control. Our proposals are of a simple character, but should, we think, be of real advantage in ameliorating the position, which can only be cured by the final removal of control, which, in turn, as we have already indicated, depends on the provision of a greater number of cheaper houses.
98. Some of us, if we had had the task of devising the original system of rent control in this country, would perhaps have proposed the setting up of rent courts in preference to the system which was in fact established. This system, into the operation of which we were appointed to enquire, is not OliG Gil which the system of rent courts could easily or appropriately be grafted.We examined with care the suggestions, which a few witnesses made to us, that rent courts ought to be set up for this country. Their proposals were of a tentative character only, and they had not envisaged at all clearly what sort of court they desired or precisely what function it could fulfil under our British system. It was not clear, for example, whether these new courts were to be obligatory courts of first instance from which an appeal would lie to the County Court, or whether they were to be substituted for the County Court, or whether they were to be subsidiary courts to which resort would be optional, or whether, as some witnesses seemed to suggest, they would be similar to mere reference committees on the lines of the Committees contemplated in Part II of the Act of 1923.99. For our part we see no necessity for an additional judicial tribunal. Nor would we see anything but disadvantage in sub-stituting at this late stage a new and untried court for the County and Sheriff Courts, which administer the Rent Restrictions Acts in England and Scotland respectively, and now possess a unique experience and knowledge of the Acts. Moreover, almost all the witnesses, including those who advocated the setting up of Rent Courts, expressed complete satisfaction with, and appreciation of, the work of the County and Sheriff Courts.As regards reference committees under Part II of the Act of 1923, it must be remembered that the whole of that Part has no reference to existing circumstances or to the circumstances which will arise if our recommendations are adopted. The Part was not intended to, and would not, come into operation except during an interim period following general decontrol. When it was enacted it was contemplated that general decontrol might take place before the housing shortage was completely cured, and there might conse-quently be a need for some partial measure of protection. If our principal recommendations are adopted, this Part of the Act might be repealed.It appears to us that behind the suggestions which were made to us for the appointment of rent courts or reference committees there lay a desire, not for some new formal court of law, but for an informal lay committee which might act as an unofficial conciliation board and centre of information and advice. This was one of the main sug-srestions made to us by the Standing Joint Committee of Indus-trial Women&apos;s Organisations. We are informed that some lopal authorities have already appointed such committees or information bureaux. As there appears to be doubt whether there is authority for their appointment, and, as we think that thev may serve a useful purpose in certain areas, we recommend that the doubt should be removed and local authorities empowered to appoint committees for the purpose of giving advice on questions arising under the Acts.
XV.   CONTROL OF RENT ONLY.100. The suggestion was made by the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Insti-tution that all forms of control might be removed, except control of rent; that is to say, the landlords should have restored to them com-plete freedom to manage and control their property but not to raise the rent above the legal maximum so long as they continued to let the property. The suggestion was put forward in the interest of good management and was carefully examined by us more especially in relation to the intermediate type of house which we have called Class 13. The proposal has a certain obvious attractiveness, principally from the point of view of the abatement of overcrowding and the better management of property. For these purposes it would place a powerful weapon in the hands of landlords and estate agents, but this weapon unfortunately coidd also be used for less beneficent pur-poses. We agree with the view which has always hitherto been taken that legislation for the control of rent, to be effective, must also provide for security of tenure. Complete freedom to eject tenants might open the door to a wholesale evasion of the provisions restricting rent.The proposal when considered in relation to Class B houses is open to the further serious objection that this type of house is the type which is frequently sold to-day whenever vacant possession can be given, and, under the proposal, such houses would doubtless be sold in large numbers over the heads of the existing tenants.For these reasons we are unable to recommend the proposal.XVI.   RATING QUESTIONS.101. Three rating questions which arise under the Acts have been brought to our notice. The first relates to the operation of section 12 (9) of the principal Act, the second is the effect of the decision in Nicholson v. Jackson, TI.L. 1921, and the third applies only to Scotland.102. Section 12 (9) of the principal Act. This section pro-vides, among other things, that for the purpose of rating, the gross value of any house to which the Act would have applied if it had been erected before the 3rd of August, 1914 (Standard Rent date), and let at that date, shall not exceed :  (a) If the house forms part of a housing scheme to which section 7 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1919, or section 5 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc. (Scotland) Act, 1919, applies, the rent (exclusive of rates) charged by the local authority in respect of that house ; and(6) In any other case the rent (exclusive of rates) which would have been charged by the local authority in respect of a similar house forming part of such a scheme as aforesaid.Section 7 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1919, wholly repealed by the Housing Act of 1923, contains the financial provi-
eions (including power to recoup losses) for carrying out approved schemes for the erection of houses.The intention of this provision was to ensure that the erection of new houses should not be discouraged by assessing them for rating purposes at their full post-war value. Since 1920 the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, and subsequent Rating Acts have been passed with the object of securing uniformity of valuation between all classes of hereditaments. In view of the provisions of these later Acts it seems clear that the rating provisions of section 12 (9) are no longer necessary, and in some areas they have caused inconvenience. We have been informed by the Central Valuation Committee, the Committee representative of all local authorities which is specially charged with the duty of promoting uniformity of valuation, that they are of opinion that the provisions of section 12 (9) as far as they relate to valuation should be repealed or discontinued.Accordingly, we recommend that the rating provisions of section 12 (9) of the principal Act should be repealed in their application to England and Wales.The Rating and Vakiation Act, 1925, did not apply to Scotland, nor has there been any parallel legislation since the date of the passing of the Act of 1920 applying to the valuation and rating of dwelling houses in Scotland. The law therefore remains as it was at that date, and, moreover, Section 43 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930, contains a provision similar to section 12 (9) of the Act of 1920 regarding the valuation and rating of dwelling houses in respect of which a contribution is payable under the Acts. In Scotland the Assessor is required to estimate the yearly value of a house at the rent at which it might be reasonably expected to let. Such yearly value is the actual yearly rent paid if such rent repre-sents the fair annual value, but not otherwise. Accordingly, if the rent charged by the local authority for a house which forms part of ;i housing scheme is less than an economic rent, the economic rent and not the rent actually paid may be entered in the Valuation Roll as the yearly value. If the sub-section were repealed the result would be that the occupier might be required to pay rates on a higher rental than he is actually paying. Since the condition which section 12 (9) was intended to meet still prevails in Scotland, and since the prin-ciple which underlies the sub-section has been re-affirmed by Parlia-ment so far as regards Scotland as recently as 1930, we think that paragraph (a) of the sub-section must still continue to apply to Scot-land. As regard paragraph (6) we are not aware to what extent, if at all, it has or could have received effect, but, in the absence of any evidence on this s\ibject, we think it should remain in the statute book. Accordingly, our recommendation as to the repeal of section 12 (9) does not extend to Scotland.103. Nicholson v. Jackson, H.L. 1921. Under the Rent Restrictions Acts the landlord is allowed to increase the rent on account of any increase in rates payable by him over the correspond-ing rates payable by him in 1914. The question arose whether this increase should be the increase in the rates assessed on the house, or
. 88the increase in the net rates payable by the landlord after deduction of any compounding allowance. the. case of Nicholson v. Jackson in the house of lords in 1921 settled this question. it was held that the permitted increase in rent on account of an increase of rates was only the increase in the rates actually paid by the landlord, not the increase in the rates assessed on the house.the effect of this judgment upon the rent restrictions acts is that-(a) whatever the poundage of rates and the percentage of com-pounding allowance, the landlord retains the amount allowed to him in 1914;(b) the tenant benefits where the amount of the current com-pounding allowance has increased since 1914, and the landlord benefits where the amount is less than in 1914;(c) in the case of properties brought into compounding for thefirst time (i.e., where there was no compounding allow-ance in 1914), the tenant gets the benefit of the com-pounding allowance in place of the landlord for whom it was intended.we think that, in equity, the law as settled by the decision in Nicholson v. Jackson should be altered so that, whatever the com-pounding allowance might be at any particular moment, it should enure to the benefit of the landlord. we recognise, however, that this would mean slight adjustments of the rents of about five million controlled houses, adjustments which would often be very difficult to make, inasmuch as it would mean searching for the records of .1914, which in many cases have been lost. accordingly, as we are not making any other recommendations which involve any recalcula-tion of the permitted increases of rent, we think that the best course in all the circumstances is to let the law stand as it is at present.104. Owner&apos;s Rates in Scotland. mention has been made in an earlier paragraph of the difference in the increase in the standard vent authorised to be made in england and in scotland. while, in england, the landlord may add an amount equal to the increase in the rates payable by him over the rates payable in 1914, in scotland, the landlord may add, in respect of landlord&quot;s rates, only an amount equal to the increase that had occurred up to whitsunday, 1920. representations on the treatment of laudlord&apos;s rates in scotland were made to all three former committees. the hunter committee recom-mended that owners in the united kingdom should in this respect be put on an equal footing, the salisbury committee made no recom-niendation on the ground that legislation was under consideration, and the onslow committee recommended that the matter should receive attention.we have, elsewhere in the renort. referred to the practice of com-pounding, under which the landlord of small houses is responsible for the tenants rates. but there is a law and practice peculiar to scotland under which every landlord on his own account pays a pro-portion of all rates. in so far as the principal act allows an increase of rent equal to the increase in the tenants rates for which the land-
lord is responsible it treats all landlords in the same way. Tt might be argued that it is more favourable to the Scottish than to the English landlord inasmuch as it allows him to add to the rout the increase in the landlords rates proper, of which there is no equivalent in England. The grievance of the Scottish landlord is that he has to bear a burden which but for the principal Act he could pass on to the tenant. The ability to pass on this burden depended, of course, not on statute but on economic considerations. To what extent, before the war, the landlords rates ultimately became really part of the rent is a question that cannot be exactly answered. Whatever was the case before the war it seems clear that in present economic cir-cumstances the tenant is not in a position, generally speaking, to pay more than the controlled rent. We were informed by certain Scottish witnesses that many landlords in Scotland were not receiving even the increases to which they were entitled under the Act, and that, on decontrol, in many cases rents were not increased. It would seem to us a doubtful policy to give the Scottish landlords the power which they have no present prospect of exercising to their own advantage, but which they might conceivably exercise to the detriment of their tenants. For these reasons we make no recommendation on the subject.XVII.   PREMISES PARTLY USED FOB, BUSINESS.105. A dwelling-house to which the Acts apply and which is partly used for business is not on that account excluded from the Acts. Some witnesses have suggested that such premises should now be entirely decontrolled. It is probable that this proposal would affect adversely a considerable number of small shopkeepers who are already suffering from the general depression of business, and vre are unable to recommend it.106. Public-houses. We see no reason, however, why public-houses should not be decontrolled. We have received representations from the Brewers&apos; Society to this effect, and have had cases of hard-ship resulting from the present system brought to our notice. We observe that the last Committee recommended that public-houses should be decontrolled.   We make the same recommendation.XVIII. MINOR AMENDMENTS AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE ACTS.107. We have received from different sources suggestions for minor amendments to almost every section in the Acts. Some of these suggestions would, apart from other considerations, make for improvement, but the Acts have now been made the subject of a great number of legal decisions, and most of the difficult questions have been settled and are understood. In these circumstances we think it would be unwise to recommend alterations in the language of the Acts for the sake of effecting minor improvements, and we have,
51therefore, endeavoured to confine our recommendations for amend-inents of the law to those which appear necessary to remedy some substantial hardship or inj\istice.If, however, our recommendations are accepted some conse-nuential amendments to section 2 of the Act of 1923 must be made. The consequential amendments which we recommend are :  (a) That where a dwelling-house, considered as a whole, is in class A, but contains one or more subsidiary dwelling-houses in Class B or Class C, decontrol of such a subsidy-diary house or houses shall follow when either the tenant of the whole house or the landlord of the whole house obtains vacant possession of the subsidiary house or houses;(b) That where a dwelling-house, considered as a whole, is in class B, but contains one or more dwelling-houses in Class C, decontrol of such subsidiary house or houses shall follow only when the landlord of the whole house comes into possession thereof.It has been represented to us that the existing language of section 2 is ambiguous, and as the above consequential amendments would in any case be necessary if our recommendations are adopted, we think that the opportunity should be taken to remove any iunbiguity. In particular, we think that it should be made clear ;hat in no circumstances should there be decontrol where a person, who is himself the statutory tenant of a dwelling house which contains a subsidiary house, comes into possession of that subsidiary house.108. Registration of decontrolled Class C houses. If our recommendation that there shall be no further decontrol of houses in Class C is adopted, it appears to us that it will be necessary to obtain a record of the houses in that class which are already decontrolled. VCe recommend that within three months after the passing of any Act giving effect to a provision which prevents further decontrol, a landlord who claims that a house in Class C is decontrolled shall Inform the local authority stating the date on which he claims that the house became decontrolled; and the local authority shall keep a register of srich claims. Failure to make such a claim within the specified period should be conclusive evidence that a house is still controlled; on the other hand the making or registration of such a &apos; laim should not prevent the claim from being challenged at any time.109. Ascertainment of Standard Rent in certain cases. Werecommend one other minor alteration of the Acts. It has been brought to our notice that every year the question of determining the standard rent of a controlled house becomes more difficult because the necessary records relating to 1914 are often not available. We think that the definition of standard rent should be retained, but that the Court should be given a discretion, in any case where
evidence for the exact determination of the standard rent is lacking, to fix the standard rent by reference to the standard rents of similar neighbouring- houses.110. Consolidation of Acts. Although we recommend that the language of the Acts should be altered as little as possible, we think that consolidation of the Acts is desirable at the earliest con-venient opportunity.XIX.   CONCLUSION.111. Our main conclusions flow from the premiss that decontrol of any class of house is dependent on whether the shortage in that class either has been or is being rapidly overtaken. We are aware that many hold the opposite view, that control is itself largely the cause of shortage and that the quickest way to cure the shortage is to remove control. Before the great expansion of building by private enterprise, the view was held that the continuance of control had a psychological effect in deterring the private person from investment in house property. This view can no longer be sustained, at any rate so far as the owner-occupier is concerned, and the present point of view of those who consider that control is harmful to house production is rather that it hampers the play of economic forces. It is argued that the housing shortage will never be completely met until the removal of control allows all rents to attain their proper economic level. The supjiorters of this view admit that there would probably be an intervening period following general decontrol when rents would rise for a time above their ultimate level, but it is this rise which they think would be the stimulus which would bring-back the private investor who looks for a return on capital invested in property which is let.We think it desirable to set out -this point of view at some length, for it is shared by many and is, in our opinion, largely mistaken. Historically, shortage or fear of shortage preceded control; but apart from this it is difficult to see why the increased production which the argument postulates would in fact follow decontrol. Private enterprise is already building at an un-precedented rate for owner-occupiers, and there is no lack of money for investment in the building societies. Until this market is saturated, private enterprise is not likely to return to the building&apos; and financing of houses to let, at least at rents within the means of working class tenants, the majority of whom are not in a position to pay a larger proportion of their income in rent than they pay at present. Moreover, decontrol would clearly not stimulate any further municipal building.For these reasons, whatever may have been the case in the past, we do not consider that to-day the artificial restriction of rent is preventing the erection of new houses on any appreciable scale. If   we   are   right,   the   case   for   decontrol,   regardless   of   the
bousing shortage, must rest on broad grounds of social justice as between the owners and the tenants. It was, in effect, the owners contention that restrictions on the owners had been in force for 16 viars already and that, although decontrol might cause some hard-ship to working class tenants, it would cause greater hardship to (he owners to continue control for a further period. We are unable to accept this view. At the same time we fully appreciate that, in imposing control on those who own or have invested their money in house property, Parliament is imposing on one section of property owners restrictions which it is imposing on no other; and, whenever restrictions of this kind are imposed in the general interest, cases of iri eat hardship among the class controlled are bound to occur. We lire, therefore, of the opinion that the restrictions should at once be lifted from any class of property as soon as it can he shown that they are no longer needed in the general interest. We have given our reasons for thinking that this position has been cached in the more expensive houses the immediate decontrol of which we have accordingly recommended.112. At the end of the Report will be found a detailed list of our recommendations. The chief of these can be summarised in a few sentences.&quot;We recommend the decontrol of all the more expensive houses, which we have called Class A. We have divided all the other houses into two classes, Class B. and Class C. We recommend that the lecontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923 should continue to apply (o houses in Class B, but not to the small working class houses which we have called Class C and of which about seven-eighths are still under control. Mortgages, we think, must remain controlled so long as the mortgaged properties are controlled, and mortgages of Class A properties should remain controlled for a further six months after decontrol of the properties in that class.We do not find that any alteration of the permitted increase of rent would be justified, but we think that every practicable step should be taken to secure that the landlord does his duty in keeping the properties in good and tenantable repair. Two &quot;of the most difficult aspects of our inquiry are the questions of the enforcement of repairs and of sub-letting. The present law provides machinery both for securing the carrying out of repairs and for protecting the interests of the sub-tenant. In each case the essence of the difficulty is that the tenant or sub-tenant, as the case may be, either is not aware of, or is reluctant to use, the machinery which the law provides for his protection. We recommend that the&apos; local authorities should be empowered to set up local advisory committees for the purpose of giving advice on questions arising under the Acts; and we think that such committees and local associations of tenants and other similar bodies may do much useful work in making known the provisions of the law, and in creating a local public opinion which will not tolerate either the landlord who starves his property or the protected tenant who abuses his privileged position to profiteer at the expense of his
sub-tenants. In addition we propose certain alterations of the law iu regard to sub-letting. .We have carefully considered the circumstances in which a land-lord should be entitled to recover possession of his property. &quot;We think that Parliament should not concern itself as at present with the reason why a landlord desires to recover his property, provided always that suitable alternative accommodation complying with the present strict definition of the Acts (slightly extended in certain directions which we have suggested) is available for the tenant, ami that the full discretion of the Court is retained to take into account all the circumstances of the case in considering whether it is reason-able that the tenant should move. Subject to these safeguards, we think that a landlord should be entitled to claim possession. &quot;We have also made certain recommendations to ease the difficult position of the owner who wants possession of his own house in order to live in it himself.We do not all share the same political philosophy, but (with the exception of one of our colleagues) we are unanimous in recommend-ing these proposals as a reasonable settlement under present condi-tions of the difficult and complex social problem which we were appointed to consider.113. There is one further aspect of the general situation brought about by control which we think should be mentioned. The tenancy of the better-class house is usually regulated by an agreement for a period of years entered into by the landlord and tenant, but the working-class tenant irsually holds his house on a weekly tenancy. Accordingly, before the Rent Restrictions Acts were passed, the working-class tenant could be turned out of his house at a weeks notice. For sixteen years this fear has been removed from his mind. The working-class tenant who pays his rent has been given almost complete security of tenure during all these years, and now attaches as much importance to this as to the restricted rent. We think-that when the shortage of working-class houses is ended, so that fiiml decontrol may safely be enacted, it will probably still be necessary to take this fact into account by making some permanent provision to ensure that, whether or not rents are payable weekly, a notice to quit shall not be effective in the case of houses in Class C until after the expiration of some specified period, such as six clear weeks from the date of the notice.114. The Committee desire to place on record their high sense of appreciation of the conspicuous services of Mr. E. C. H. Salmon, who has acted as Secretary to the Committee. He has shown great ability and devotion throughout, in the heavy work of arranging for the evidence, of compiling the summaries, and of the preparation of the Report. The Committee are most grateful to him for the invaluable help he has rendered.The Committee also desire to express their appreciation of the excellent work of Mr. A. C. Sturman, who has performed most
efficiently the onerous duties which have devolved upon him as Assistant Secretary.We have the honour to be, Sirs, Your obedient Servants,(Signed)       MARLEY (Chairman).VICTOR A. CAZALET. J. E.

SALMON (Secretary).Mr. Graham was unable to sign this Report and has submitted a separate Report.
1. Class A houses to be decontrolled.   (Para. 41.)Class B houses to continue to be subject to tlie decontrollingprovisions of the Act of 1923.   (Para. 43.) Class C houses to cease to be subject to the decontrolling provisions of the Act of 1923.   (Paras. 44-49.) 2. We recommend that the limits of these classes shall be defined by reference to rateable values at April 1st, 1931, for England ami Wales, and yearly value in the Valuation Roll for 1931-1932 for Scotland.   The limits of rateable value* or yearly value which we suggest are:  Class A houses In the Metropolitan Police District,  45 or over. In the rest of England and Wales,  35 or over. In Scotland,  45 or over. Class B houses In the Metropolitan Police District, over  20 but less than  45.In the rest of England and Wales, over  13 but less than  35.In Scotland, over  26 5s. but less than  45. Class C houses -In the Metropolitan Police District,  20 or under.In the rest of England and Wales,  13 or under.In Scotland,  26 5s. or under. (Paras. 41-49.)3. Mortgages. Mortgages should remain controlled so long as the mortgaged properties are controlled.   (Para. 52.)The provisions of the Acts relating to mortgages on Class A houses should remain in force for six months after the date for decontrol of houses in this class.   (Para. 53.)4. Public houses should be decontrolled.   (Para. 106.)5. The permitted increase of rent and the enforcement of repairs.  We do not recommend any alteration in the permitted increase of rent, but we make certain proposals designed to secure that tenants are made aware of their right to have their houses kept in proper repair.   (Para. 71.)6. Alternative Accommodation. (a) The definition of alternative accommodation should be ex-tended so as to include :  (i) A house provided by the local authority, (ii) If the conditions as to security of tenure are satisfied, a house which, although not actually provided by the local authority, is certified by the authority to be similar to the hoitses so provided in accommodation and rent. (Para. 74.)*The approximately corresponding current controlled weekly rents (inclu-sivc of rates) are given in the paragraphs referred to and in the tables in the Appendix.SUMMARY OR RECOMMENDATIONS.
(iii) Accommodation -which the Court is satisfied will be avail-able when any Order for possession becomes effective. (Para. 76.)(Z;) In cases where the local authority are willing to undertake the provision of new alternative accommodation, a certificate from the authority undertaking to make this provision should be sufficient evidence that alternative accommodation will be available.   (Para.75.)(c) The law should be simplified so as to provide that, wherever alternative accommodation is available, the landlord shall be entitled to apply for possession, the discretion of the Court being retained to consider the general reasonableness of the application having regard to the circumstances both of the landlord and the tenant. (Para. 77.)7. Possession for Own Occupation. The benefit of the Prevention of Eviction Act, 1924, should be extended to owners who have bought houses since 1924 and desire possession for their own occupation or for the occupation of their son or daughter, aged over 18. The date of this Report should be substituted for 5th May, 1924, in section 1 of the Act.   (Para. 81.)8. Sub-letting by Statutory Tenants.(i) In case of extortionate charging by a statutory tenant, the landlord should have the right to apply for possession, (ii) Statutory tenants should be required to notify landlords ifthej- are sub-letting, (iii) In certain cases there should be a penalty for extortionate charges to sub-tenants.

MINORITY REPORT.BY MR. DUNCAN GRAHAM.While I am in general agreement with many of the views expressed by the members of the Committee who have signed the Report, there are several of their conclusions concerning important matters which I cannot agree with conclusions which I do not con-sider can be justified, either by the. experience that has been had of the operations of the Rent Restrictions Acts, or by the economic or other circumstances that prevail at the present time.DECONTROLLED HOUSES.Strong evidence was tendered to the Committee in favour of coii-trol not only being continued, but that it should be restored to those houses which for one reason or another have been decontrolled. I may at once say that I am satisfied that the claims in both those respects are fully justified. It has been estimated that about one-eighth of the working-class houses have become decontrolled under the provisions of the Act of 1923, and that the decontrolled rents of such houses range on an average from 85 per cent, to 90 per cent, above the pre-war rents, as compared with 50 per cent, increase in the rent of a controlled house. These statements, to my mind, are a serious reflection of what may ultimately come to be the position as regards rents of working-class houses. The circumstances of the whole country as regards the provision of working-class houses and the ability of the working class to pay rents are such that to my mind they require complete control for all houses up to a certain rental. The rental I suggest for Scotland is  60 (pre-war) exclusive of rates. My colleagues in the Committee seem to be impressed with the con-sideration that if pre-war and post-war houses are brought under control it would tend to shake the confidence of private capital and private enterprise in the building industry. Their concern evidently is that private enterprise should be induced to come in as quickly as possible to meet the housing needs of the country. That is a view which I cannot in any circumstances accept. The country simply cannot get back to the old position of trusting solely to private enter-prise to provide houses for the working classes as, when, and where it pleases, and at rentals such as it decrees. The disastrous experience of private enterprise in past days should be a warning to all who are concerned with the social uplift of the people. Another reason given by my colleagues against resuming control of decontrolled houses is that decontrolled houses have frequently changed hands at rents or prices which are high, and that to bring them now again under con-trol would be immediately to reduce their market value. That, to my mind, is not a sufficient reason to debar the large number of people who are now suffering from decontrol from receiving the protection which they are entitled to along with their fellow tenants. The com-paratively few who have been &quot;trading &quot; in houses and who might suffer pecuniary loss do not, I am satisfied, come within the category of the working classes in its truest sense.
THE PERMITTED INCREASE OF BENT.I am wholeheartedly in disagreement with my colleagues who recommend that no change should take place in the amount allowed for increase in rents. They state that the average increase in wages rates among persons in employment is greater than the increase in controlled rents. If this statement is made with a view to showing lhat the tenants are better off than they formerly were, then I contest ii strenuously. It cannot surely be contended that the whole increase of wages or even the greater part of any increase should be set aside to pay for increased rental. There are many other necessary items of expenditure in the household which must obviously come into the reckoning. While I do not contest the average increase above-mentioned it is evident, to my mind, that in jhe industrial districts, particularly where living conditions are severe, the reductions have hit the working classes very seriously indeed, much more seriously in fact than can be conveyed by the statement above referred to. There is this further fact to be borne in mind that reduced working time is now in vogue in a number of industries. Again, my (ulleagues clearly admit as regards the 25 per cent, increase allowed for increased cost of repairs, that there has been a substantial fall in prices for building materials and labour costs, but notwithstanding tiiis admission they do not recommend any alteration. I am not sitisfied that the explanations given by my colleagues on evidence submitted by Chartered Surveyors, Property Owners and Factors, bear out the claims that are made for continuing the present percentages. As regards houses built since the passing of the Housing Act of 1919, and which have not been subject to control, these have mostly been provided by local authorities. The rents of the local authority houses are regulated either by statute or by rules prepared by the Ministry of Health or the Department of Health tor Scotland. The rentals of those houses were fixed generally when wages were high, but, although wages have admittedly fallen appre-ciably, there has been great difficulty in many districts in getting local authorities to reduce their rentals. As a result, many tenants have found that it was not possible for them to pay the rentals, and have had to vacate the houses. This has resulted in overcrowding of other houses, and has increased the difficulties of the local authori-ties in dealing with slum clearance and the like. In my judgment the protection of the working classes in the matter of rental should be the same whether they occupy a privately owned house or a local authority house. They should, therefore, all be under control. This result might be secured if provision were made by statute for the local authorities applying their rules and regulations as to rentals, in conformity with the law and practice in force as regards privately owned controlled houses.ENFORCEMENT OF REPAIRS.I am of the opinion that while the issuing of certificates by the sanitary authority as to the reasonable state of repair of a house has had some good effects, it still has certain disadvantages.   There can
GObe no doubt that many tenants are deterred from applying- to tlie sanitary authority for a certificate on account of the risk of incurring the displeasure and hostility of the owner. It should not, to my mind, be the duty of the tenant to represent to the sanitary authority that the house he occupies is insanitary. The owner of every house should be prohibited from offering a house to be let which is not in all respects sanitary and suitable for occupation. He should be the person to obtain the certificate, and no house should be on the market which has not a certificate issued for it to the owner that the condition of the house satisfies the sanitary authority. I, therefore, am in favour of an alteration of the present law to require that the owner should be the party to obtain the necessary certificate.POSSESSION.I entirely disagree with the proposals of my colleagues under this section of the Report. I consider that owners of houses who desire to obtain possession are adequately protected under the pro-visions of the present law.RENT COURTS.I regret that the Committee have not seen their way- to devise-some new form of tribunal for dealing with rents and generally with the questions that arise between landlord and tenant. A much simpler and more expeditious and less costly system is clearly called for. The housing of the working classes is now such a speciality; it is of such magnitude and its social aspect is so peculiar and important that it should be taken right out of the category of the ordinary law procedure and practice. I agree that there must he the legal element in any scheme, but other elements bringing in particularly representatives of the local authority of the district, whose duty it is by law to see to the adequate provision of working class houses, to see to their proper upkeep and maintenance, and to see to the healthy conditions of the occupants, should also be con-sidered. This is a matter of first class importance, and I think that the proposal for no alteration of the system should not be dismissed without a much fuller enquiry and investigation.(Signed)   DUNCAN M.
