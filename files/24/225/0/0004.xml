A K----^IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITidNNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVEENMENT. - -...EGRET c CABINET. COPY NO. ___J&quot;.304 (31) . COTTON      TRADE____DISPUTES . /MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER 0? LABOUR.Two important developments have taken place in the Cotton Industry within the past few days:-(1) The Central Committee of the Cotton Manufacturers&apos;Association has recommended the Local Associations to authorise them to give to the Operatives&apos;  Trade Unions one month&apos;s notice of the Employers&apos; 1 intention to determine all wages agreementsc (2) The Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation has given a month&apos;s notice to the Trade Unions of their intention to terminate on December 31st the Hours Agreement of 1919. It will be seen that neither of these courses makes any immediate change in conditions.These two developments have occurred independently of one another but together they indicate that the industry is about to bring to an issue questions affecting labour costs which have for a long time been the subject of controversy.,Employers on both sides of the industry have long felt that labour costs must be reduced in order that the industry may be placed in a position to compete with other countries.      In 1929, an arbitration award after a stoppage of work reduced wages in both spinning and weaving by 6.41 per cent, but this has not been regarded as disposing of the matter. Manufacturing Section.   (Weaving).Since that time, discussion in the manufacturing section has been concentrated on the &quot;more looms&quot; question,  i.e.,  the employment of weavers on more than four looms,  on conditions other than those in the    Four-Loom List,  the object being to reduce the manufacturing cost of certain plain and other cloths.      There was a lock-out in the weaving section at the beginning of this year on this
question.       While the Weavers&apos; Amalgamation have now accepted in principle the minding of more looms per weaver the two sides have failed to reach agreement on the wages and other conditions to applj  and a deadlock was again reached on 24th November.      The constitutional position is that, whatever the number of looms per weaver, wages are determined by the Pour Loom List which has &quot;been the basic agreement in the industry for 59 years.      The employers,  therefore cannot operate this system on any other terms so long as this agree-ment is binding upon  them and, no other agreement having been made,   their Central.Committee has decided to ask their Local Associations to give them authority to give the required month&apos;s notice to terminate all the wages agreements.      This recommendation will certainly be accepted and it may be expected that the necessary notice will be given to the Unions in the early part of December to terminate probably in the second week of January.      The employers will then be free either to make a new general agreement or to make agreements at individual mills or to operate nev? conditions without agreement.There is no immediate reason for any stoppage of work and there will certainly be negotiations in the interval. Other unions than the Weavers&apos; Amalgamation are involved and they may be expected to exercise an influence towards a peaceful solution.      It may be hoped also that,  confronted with this situation,   the more stubborn elements of the Weavers Executive will see the need to face the issues-,  among which is the disintegration of the Weavers&apos; Amalgamation itself.It is particularly desirable that the various organisa-tions concerned should be made to realise that the responsi-bility for finding a solution of the problem rests mainly upon them and they should not be given an expectation of
early intervention by the Government.      This would be taken as a means of avoiding that responsibility.      Already the encouragement given to the idea that reorganisation of the industry will produce the necessary reduction of costs and that tho Government will,  if required, pass legislation with this object, has been for a long time an impediment to negotiations.      The Department is in a position to keep in close touch v/ith developments without interfering with this position.      Any overt action would be resented by the employers. Spinning Section.The situation in the Spinning section of the industry is distinct from that on the manufacturing side..     Both sections made agreements in 1919 reducing weekly hours from 55-g- to 48 and increasing wages rates in order that earnings might not be reduced.      The Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation has been engaged in negotitaions with the Spinners&apos;; Amalgamation and the Cardroom Amalgamation for the purpose of exploring other changes which would reduce costs and the decision to give a month&apos;s notice to terminate the Hours Agreement on December 31st in order to retrace the step taken in 1919 has come somewhat suddenly.      It is not&apos;,  however, unexpected as considerable pressure, led by Bolton, has been long exercised to this end.      It should be noted that the notice does not specify the new weekly hours proposed..The Spinners invited the Manufacturers to join with, them in this action but the. latter,  at their meeting on Friday last,  decided only to take the action described above. The Spinners&apos; Federation has invited all organisations concerned-to meet them and such a meeting will certainly take place, It will soon become clear that there will be a powerful resistance to the proocsed lengthening of hours and that, apart from the strength of the male spinners&apos;- organisation, the workers themselves will not return to a 6 a.m.  start
unless forced by an overwhelming and united power which, judged by the post,  the employers will probably not bo able to exert.It is important not to confuse the giving of notices with the imposition of new conditions.    jdiven when notices have expired and no new agreement has been reached, old conditions may be maintained for a time as in the case of the Woollen Industry in which wages agreements have long been terminated. Much discussion will take place during the coming weeks and it may be expected that pressure will probably be brought to bear on the Government to intervene3    There is no need, however, to assume3 a.s is being stated,  that some agreement will not be reached or that a general stoppage is likely in January.    Iremature action taken on that assumption might easily make less likely a settlement or settlements within the industry itself.    It is known that certain important undertakings have no intention of having a stoppage and that is bound to have a great effect on the final position. lLoreover.it will probably prove that the Master opinners&apos;  real objective is much less than the extension of weekly hours to 55tto    They do not at present get a full 48 hours&apos; production owing to time taken for cleaning and oiling and this and other matters may at last become negotiable as a result of their present drastic action,,      A general closing of mills by the employers can be put into operation only after a ballot of all members and the agreement in writing of owners of 88 per cent of the spindle capacity.As stated above, I shall keep in close touch with developments,  and advantage will be taken of the close touch which is always maintained with both sides in the industry to do what is possible to guide the disputes along peaceful and fruitful lines.    Anything in the nature of open intervention, however, should be avoided.H. B,.S0th wovember-,  1931,.
