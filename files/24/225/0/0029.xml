INDIA.Appreciations of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 18th November and 19th December.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for India proposes to circulate to the Cabinet the series of appreciations of the Indian situation, which are drawn up at intervals by the Government of India for the confidential information of the Dominion Governments.     The attached appreciations, dated the 18th November and 19th December, are the first of the Cabinet series.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated the 18th November, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.I.    The chief events of the past month relate to (a)  the terrorist situation in Bengal,   (b)  the Kashmir agitation,   and (c)  the development of the agrarian agitation in United Provinces.2.    A separate appreciation of the Bengal situation has been sent to Secretary of State.    It  is sufficient here to say that attempts on lives of District Magistrate,  Dacca,   and Villiers,  President of European Association,  have  intensified feelings in Bengal and position has been cause of much anxiety.    An ordinance was issued on 29th October widening scope of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act,  the Act which provides for the arrest and detention without trial of terrorists.    The extension of the scope of the Act will greatly strengthen the hands of the Local Government in dealing with terrorist organisation.    A number of arrests have been made under the new ordinance and more are in contemplation.    The Press Act enables control to be exercised over incitement to violence in the Press.    Additional measures will be taken at an early date to   deal with particular aspects of the movement.    These, teg-ether with the measures already taken should have a steadying effect on European and Muslim opinion and materially assist the executive who have to deal with a grave menace.    It is too much to expect that outrages can be completely stopped,   since it  is almost impossible to guard with complete success against murderous attempts by youths who are willing to sacrifice their own lives,  but it should be practicable very considerably to reduce the risk and to check the activities of the worst associations.3
-   .  2?g3.     Ten ore twelve days ago events relating to Kashmir threatened to create a situation of very great danger in the Punjab, which might have easily spread throughout Earth India. The organisation of jathas by a section of the Punjab Mussulmans for the purpose of entering Kashmire territory,to bring pressure on the Kashmir Durbar to redress the alleged grievances of Moslem State subjects, would have led inevitably to a serious clash between the jathas and the State forces, had they been allowed to continue.    Several such clashes did occur, but fortunately they were on a small scale.    At the same time, communal feeling in Jammu territory reached a very dangerous height, and communal disturbances occurred in Jammu town.    At the request of the Durbar, British troops were sent into State territory,  accompanied by selected British civil officers.These took over the situation in the areas to which they were sent, with excellent effect. Communal tension inside the state was relieved, public confidence restored and arrangements for the large number of Moslem prisoners put on more satisfactory basis.At the same time, an Ordinance was promulgated which gave the Punjab Government power to deal with jathas in their territory,  and so prevent them entering Kashmir.These preventive measures were followed by an announcement by the Maharajah which provided (a) for enquiry by a European sessions judge into the alleged excesses by State forces and police during September; (b)  an enquiry by a Committee presided over by a senior officer of the Foreign and Political Department into the alleged religious and secular disabilities od the different communities of State subjects;  Oc) a conference presided over by the same officer to discuss constitutional reforms.The s e,.. . .
m.These announcements have been well received by responsible Mohammedans arid the situation is easier. The extreme section of Moslems, however, has not yet abandoned organisation of jathas and although response to agitation is less the danger of unfavourable developments has not passed. In fact the latest reports in&amp;modifications e that there Is a danger of the real issue being obscured under the influence of unreasonable communal and religious sentiments.4. The situation in the United Provinces has assumed prominence owing to the revival of agitation by the Provincial Congress,  led by Jawahar Lai Eehru.    They have concentrated on the question ox rent, with special reference to  the Allahabad District,    The position ia as follows:-several months ago Local Government initiated the appointment of Committee of members of the Legislative Council to  consider the revision of rents necessary on account of the fall in agricultural values.    This Committee coopted a member of Congress, who refused to serve.    The Committee made certain recommendations involving an estimated remission of over 4 crores of rents,  and the Local Government have accepted these proposals.    Congress, at first, to oh the line that the application of the proposals in Allahabad district gave quite inadequate relief,  and discussions on this point have been held between the Local Government and Provincial Congress leaders, he-examination of the Allahabad rents is mow in progress, but it is most improbable that such substantial relief will be given as vail be acceptable to Congress.    At the same time, Congress are talcing the general line that the remissions recommended by the Committee of the Legislative Council for the province generally are totally inadequate.    They are also   -demanding that allarrears...&apos;.
arrears if rent shall be remitted and, farther, that tenants evicted on account of non-payment of rent should he reinstated.    The two latter -propositions would require legislation.   Except in 2 or 3 districts the eviction of tenants has not been above normal, and arrears of rent are due, to very considerable extent, to Congress agitation early in the year.    The position,  therefore,  is that Congress demands are entirely unacceptable, that their activities are stirring up ill feeling between landlords and tenants, and that they are likely to cause severe loss to the former.At the same time,  Congress are attempting, though not so vigorously, to stir up trouble between landlords and Government or the ground that the latter have not given adequate remissions of land revenue.    Some weeks ago, the Provincial Congress Committee, mainly at the instigation of Jawahar Lai,  asked the Working Committee to give permission to start a &quot;no rent1&apos; campaign.     The Working Committee consulted Gandhi who gave the Committee full discretion. The Committee in turn gave Vallabhai Patel, their President, full power.    A few days ago Vallabhai Patel gave Provincial Congress Committee complete discretion.    This means that decision virtually rests with Jawahar Lai and his Lieutenants, Jawahar Lai has been straining at the leash for months and is in no mood to see reason.    In fact, today1s press telegrams state that Provincial Congress Committee has given the Allahabad District Committee authority to advise tenants and revenue payers to withhold rent and revenue respectively pending discussion with Local Government. The situation may easily develop very rapidly into what in effect would be a revival of civil disobedience,  for it is clear that a &quot;no rent and no revenue&quot; campaign involvessuch.....
such revival.    It cannot he confined to one district of the province and once started in the United Provinces there is a definite probability of its extension elsewhere, for the measures necessary to counter it would force Congress to consider the question as to whether they as a body could treat the matter as of provincial concern. It is,  therefore,   far from improbable that Jawahar Lai may, at a very early date, force an issue in the United Provinces, which would involve a general revival of civil disobedience, in spite of the fact that in the country generally there is little enthusiasm for such a revival.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated the 19th December 1931, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.    The last appreciation dealt with (a) the terrorist situation in Bengal,   (b) the Kashmir agitation and (c) agrarian agitation in the United Provinces.   The information in regard to these matters may be brought up-to-date .2.    On November 30th an Ordinance was promulgated to provide,  firstly for certain operations in the Chittagong District and,   secondly,   for the speedy trial of terrorist offences.    In April 1930 a well-organised terrorist raid was made on the Armoury at Chittagong.    The raiders escaped at the time,   and although subsequent operations accounted for the greater part of the gang,   a certain number could not be captured.   These, under the leadership of one Surja Sen, have remained in concealment in the district ever since,  and have been responsible for a number of plots to assassinate Government officers.   They have a considerable number of sympathisers in the district, while others have,   so far, been afraid to give information regarding their movements. They have practically succeeded in establishing a reign of terror.    Quite apart from the necessity of rounding up this gang it was very desirable to restore the prestige of the administration in the district,  and these are the two main objects of the operations that have been undertaken.   They are being carried out by the civil authorities with the aid of the military and it will be contrary to expectations if sensational results are obtained at an early date.The Indian press have represented the Ordinance and the plan of operations as constituting in effect a state
of martial lav/.    This view is entirely erroneous.    The Ordinance,   it is true,  gives large powers,  which are necessary to assist the plan of operations,  hut they are being administered so as to cause the minimum interference with ordinary civil avocations,   and both the civil and military authorities are taking the utmost care to maintain strict discipline,   and to prevent any abuse of their powers.    It is directly contrary to the policy of the Indian Government and of the Local Government to create anything in the nature of a counter-reign of terrorism,  which would,   in fact,   defeat one of their many purposes,  which is to restore the confidence of the people in orderly administration and the power of the Government  to maintain law and order.    While,  therefore,  the first effect of this part of the Ordinance has inevitably been loud protests against repression,  the ultimate effect on public opinion should be good,  if the operations proceed according to plan.The seond part of the Ordinance contains important changes  in the ordinary procedure for the trial of terrorist offences.    In particular,   it provides for the constitution of a special tribunal against whose orders there will be no appeal to the High Court.    It also makes terrorist attempts at murder capital offences.    The provision against which most criticism has so far been levelled is the abolition of the right of appeal,   but  in this connection it has to be remembered that the tribunal is to be presided over by a Judge or ex-Judge of the High Court,   assisted by two colleagues qualified for appointment to the High Court.    There is there-fore,  no question of the accused persons having anything but a fair trial.In addition to the above, Local Government have been taking action under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance,which
which issued on &quot;29th October,  and a considerable number of terrorists have been arrested,  although, unfortunately a number pf warrants have not yet been executed.    In some directions the police have achieved marked success,  and particularly in rounding up&amp;in Calcutta and elsewhere members of a very dangerous organisation with headquarters at Dacca.A certain number of detenu leaders have been removed from the province and arrangements are in train for the removal of others.    The removals have been carried out without any trouble and should have a good effect on the discipline of the detention camps in Bengal.The good effect of these measures has been discounted to a considerable extent by the murder, which has just occurred,   of Mr. Stevens,  District Magistrate,  Tippera.    This outrage is particularly sinister since,  according to present information,  it was committed by two girl students and is the first in which women have been actual assassins,  although it has been known for some time that they were taking an increasing part in the terrorist movement.    It is to be feared that this occurrence will give a definite impetus to similar crimes by women.    The difficulties of preventing isolated murders are so great that it  is too much to expect that measures recently taken will completely succeed within a short period,  and,   in the meantime,  every fresh outrage increases the danger of reprisals which can only complicate the situation^At present there is no strong body of public opinion openly declaring itself in support of the Government.    On the contrary, the measures recently taken have been bitterly criticised and have increased the feeling against the Government  among some sections of the population. There has been considerable talk of organised counter-action and
Illand at a provincial conference,  held at Berhampore under the auspices of Congress,  a resolution was passed in favour of intensive boycott of British goods and institutions.      It remains to he seen whether this resolution will he endorsed by responsible Congress organisations.      If so,  and if effect is given to it, measures will be necessary to deal with the situation. In this connection it is interesting to observe that Subhas Chandra Bose publicly gave it as his opinion at the Conference that no district in Bengal was at present ready for the civil disobedience movement,   although he qualified this by observing that, with three or four months,  preparation,  the province would be ready.3. The Kashmir agitation continues,  and arrests in the Punjabaverage between one hundred and two hundred daily.     The original issues have become obscured and leaders find it difficult to connect the continuance of Jathabandi with the Kashmir grievances. The great majority of moderate Muslims frankly admit that announcements of the Kashmir Durbar go as far as can be expected, but none the less there is considerable sympathy even among them towards the - movement,     They regard it as evidence of the power of the Muslims to organise,   and therefore of value in constitutional field,      &apos;Vo :     -far there has been very satisfactory absence of incidents in Punjab itself and although there has been tendency for agitation to take an anti-Government form,  this is not particularly marked at present.      If has of course embittered communal feelings and a counter movement is in progress among Hindus to form a pro-Kashmir volunteer organisation,     There is a wider movement to retaliate by threatening incursions of Hindus into Muhammadan States.      So long as active Jathabandi continues there is cause for considerable anxiety and,  even after it ceases, there is no certainty of a permanent solution.      The danger will remain that,  just or unjust, Kashmir will be made a pretext forMusiim/
Muslim organisation when this seems likely to serve the community&apos;s purpose.4. Events are moving rapidly in the United Provinces.The position,   as reported by the Local Government in a letter of 11th December,   is briefly as follows.     The provincial Congress have sanctioned a no-rent campaign in five districts,  and applications from ten other districts are pending.      Overt action has been taken to give effect to the campaign.      In Allahabad District volunteers have been despatched in considerable numbers to the villages,  headed by forces of members of the Hindustan Sewa Dal.      Collection of revenue in this district has been entirely suspended and the District Officers report that it will be useless to hope that the landlords will be able to pursue the collection of rent unless exceptional measures are taken.      In Cawnpore,  Congress have broadcast a number of leaflets calling for non-payment of rent and revenue,  and here also volunteers have been sent to the villages.      In Oudh the two districts at present most affected are Rae Lareli and Unao.      The collection of rent had begun,  but owing to the recent visit of Jawahar Lai and other leaders,  collections have stopped.      In other districts secret propaganda is going on.      The stage has now been reached in which overt action by Congress leaves nffi doubt that they intend pursuing the no-rent campaign with energy.     The Local Government have,  in fact,  reported that immediate and effective steps arenecessary to control the campaign in order to prevent the situation getting out of hand.      If these steps are taken, District Officers believe that difficulty in collecting rents will rapidly tend to disappear.      An Ordinance was promulgated on the 14th giving powers required by the   Local Government,   and the situation is likely to develop rapidly.5. The position in the North West Prontier Province alsoappears to be reaching a crisis.     In all districts except Peshawar the situation has,   on the whole,   improved during the past few/
....... mfew months,  but in that district there has been a definite deterioration.      Abdul Ghaffar Khan&apos;s speeches have been more objectionable then ever.      There have been instances of disobedience to lawful orders.    A movement has been started to set up parallel institutions,  and people are being exhorted not to take canal water.      Although a no-revenue campaign is not being openly preached,   there is little doubt that it is being done secretly,  and collections are very much in arrears;    there has been a very serious increase in crime;    and attempts are being made to spread subversive activities across the border adjacent to the Peshawar district.      There is no sign that the policy of Kis Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to reforms will produce a more reasonable attitude on the part of Abdul Ghaffar Khan.      On the contrary,  there is evidence that he will persist in his demand for independence.The policy of the Government has been to take all action possible under ordinary law,  but owing to probable reactions on Muslims,   to avoid extraordinary measures so long as practicable.      It is in particular desirable,   if circumstances will permit,   that such measures,  when necessary,   should be directed against Abdul Ghaffar Khan on a Congress ticket  rather than on any other ground.     Up to a point,   ordinary Law has been sufficient to prevent the situation getting out of control,   but the Chief Commissioner is very doubtful whether he can hold his hand much longer and any day he may have to ask for special measures.      These will,   of course,  become necessary in any case if, as a result of developments elsewhere,  Red Shirts definitely ad;Opt civiX disobedience.6. The above represents briefly the existing situation inparticular Provinces.      The general attitude of Congress is at present uncertain - matters may possibly come to a head before Gandhi&apos;s return to India but probability appears to be that Working Committee may await until he reaches Bombay on 28th.
A meeting of the Committee will he held almost immediately and position is likely to become clear by the end of this month or very early in January.      In the meantime the action which has been forced upon Government in the United Provinces,  or the measures taken in ITorth West Frontier Province if these become necessary,  may leave Congress little choice in the natter.      They can hardly fail to support Jav/ahar Lai in his no-rent campaign or Abdul Ghaffar Khan if action has teen taken against him.They will probably have to decide whether a boycott campaign is to be startted in Bengal.      They may possibly attempt to avoid a general revival of the civil disobedience movement at the moment while approving of provincial movements,  but this cannot appreciably affect the main issue.      It is by no means improbable that they will attempt to make co-operation in constitutional matters conditional on certain action by Government, e.g.,  withdrawal of Bengal Ordinances and re-opening of rent question in United Provinces.     They are for tactical reaaons to express either unqualified approval or disapproval of statement of Prime Minister.      It is,   however,   difficult to see what  course they can take which will not bring them into direct conflict with Government within a very few weeks,  not merely in particular Provinces but generally.It is difficult to estimate dangers of, civil disobedience movement if it  is revived.      There are undoubtedly-serious differences of opinion among Congress leaders as well as among the rank and file,   and generally speaking the country is not ready for a further campaign-      On the other hand,  differences are apt to disappear when a campaign hegins,  and experience in United Provinces seems to suggest a no-rent movement may spread very rapidly although events may prove that it can be as quickly stopped.      It is certain that if Congress decide on civil disobedience and are allowed to get their organisation fully at work they will quickly overcome the disadvantages of comparative unpreparedness.
