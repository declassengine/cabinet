9 toTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.                CABINET.        PROPOSED DUTY ON FOREIGN WHEAT.MEMORANDUM BY T^MINISTER, OF ^AGRICULTURE, AND FISHERIES.August last, I was asked to circulate a memorandum explaining the effect on the price to the consumerof the proposed duty of 2/- per quarter on foreignwheat, having regard to the different countries of origin of wheat used to produce the loaf inordinary consumption.         The attached Memorandum is accordinglycirculated for the information of my colleagues *secret copy NO.CP.  299(32).At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 27th(Intld.) J.G.23rd September, 1932.
s cr oo J ciTHE EFFECT OF A DUTY ON FOREIGN WHEAT OF 2/- PER QUARTER                 ON ?Hfi PRICE OF BKEAD I    -     1.   The factors involved in this question are socomplicated that it is not possible to give it a preciseanswer.  There is, however, a strong presumption, for thereasons set out below, that the ultimate effect of the dutyon bread prices would be very small, if not negligible.     2.   Although the United Kingdom imports annuallymuch larger quantities of wheat than any other country, theEmpire as a whole is a nett exporter of wheat.  The averagenett exports for the years 1927-1929 amounted to approximately154 million bushels.  If wheat could be regarded as a singlecommodity, it is fairly obvious, therefore, that the 2/- duty would have no appreciable effect on prices, since any foreignwheat diverted from the U.K. market in consequence of theduty would pro tanto replace Empire wheat  in the markets ofother importing countries.     3.   Any effect on prices of the duty is, therefore,likely to depend mainly on the fact that millers require acertain mixture of different wheats in order to maintain thequality of flour and bread.     4.   The position in regard to the different wheatsused is, however, by no means a simple one, nor are the proportions (say of hard and soft wheats respectively) rigid.There is a wide degree of interchangeability between differentwheats.  The position may be summed up as  follows.     5.   British millers do not manufacture one, butseveral types of flour for which different wheats are used.The use of Canadian hard wheat (spring sown wheat) isdesirable on account of its &quot;strength&quot;, but not absolutely                            1.
necessary.  All spring wheats vary in &quot;strength&quot; from, one type to another and from one season to another, and similarlysoft wheats vary, e.g. Argentine wheat may in some seasonsmake a satisfactory loaf without the addition of any springwheat flour.  In general, however, cbout equal proportions of hard and soft wheats are used in the miller1s grist.  It isnot possible to classify the wheats from any one countrydefinitely as to character.  Before the war, for example,Russian Ghirka (spring wheats) were strong, but the type ofRussian wheat has considerably cimnged in post-war years.The chief source of the hard spring wheat is the prairieprovinces of Canada, while a certain amount has been imported from the United States.  The chief sources of imported softwheats are Australia and the  Argentine.  Certain small amountshave also been obtained from Germany.         6.  The following table showE the proportions ofwheat of Empire and foreign origin respectively imported during recent years, and it will be seen that the proportion drawn from foreign countries has tended to increase.  It is, however,to be expected that there will be a falling off from theUnited States (which hes already occurred in 1931) and for thepresent it is at least unlikely that a high proportion willbe drawn from Russia whether there is a duty or not.

Although Canadian wheat is valuable for &quot;strength&quot;the proportion necessary to use in the mix for solelytechnical reasons is small.   The same is true of soft wheats.Both are to a considerable extent interchangeable, and thegoverning factor is price.     8.   Sinoe U.K. requirements of hard wheats canwithout question be obtained within the Empire with verylittle change in the existing practice, the main questionrelates to the soft wheats.   Looked at statistically, itseems probable that australian ^a could meet the bulk of our requirements of soft wheat.   It is, however, not certainthat in practice this would happen, since the relatively highfreight to this country compared with that to some of Australia&apos;s                            3.
nearer eastern markets might he an obstacle.   It isdifficult to measure this factor, hut in so far as it wasoperative, it would tend to raise prices,      9,   On the other hand it seems probable that any surplus wheat which Bussia sought to dispose of on theU.K, market would be sold at the ruling prices, and wouldin consequence bear the duty,     10.   In these circumstances, it seems reasonable toinfer that the fact that flour is manufactured from a mixtureof various wheats, would not in itself cause a material risein the price to the consumer.     11.   More important, however, is the large proportionof wheat at present obtained from foreign countries.   On theassumption that the Dominions keep their part of the bargain not to sell in the United Kingdom markets above theworld&apos;s prices, the effect of the duty would seem to be either that British millers will largely replace foreign wheat byEmpire wheat or that the foreign exporter of wheat will bear the duty,,   There is, however, bound to be a transition period during which the market becomes accustomed to the effects ofthe duty.   During this period it is at least possible thatthe duty might have some effect on prices.     12.   A further factor tending to prevent a rise inbread prices in consequence of the duty would be the fact thatEmpire flour is imported free of duty.   It would be difficult for the United Kingdom millers, who are in competition with HJmpire millers, to pass on to the consumer any increasein the cost of wheat without losing some of their business.(This is indeed one of the grievances to which the millershave given expression).
357   13.  Generally, therefore,  it can ho aaid that whileit is impossible to give a definite reply to the  questionwhether the 2/- per quarter duty on foreign wheat islikoly to increase the price of broad in the country,  the probability, on balance, is that the effect will  be exceedingly small, apart from any temporal y effect duringthe transition period immediately following the impositionof the duty.  There is, moreover, tho further consideration that under the terms of the draft Ottawa agreements,  theright has been reserved to the Government to remove the dutyif at any time Empire producers of wheat are unable or unwilling to offer this commodity on first sale in the United kingdom at prices not exceeding the world prices and in quantitiessufficient to supply the requirements oi?
