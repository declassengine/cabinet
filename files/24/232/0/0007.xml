                 IINTRODUCTORY NOTE,        Conversations took place between the Prime Minister and Mr.  de Valera on 15th July in accordance with suggestions made to him on the previous night by Mr. Norton.       Mr. de Valera reached London at 5.50 p.m., and the meeting was appointed to take place at 7.30 p.m,       At 7.30 a telephone message was received that  Mr. cTe Valera was not-prepared to come to Downing Street unless he was to see the Prime Minister alone, as he  had had no conversations with his own colleagues.    The Prime Minister sent a reply that he could not see Mr.  de Valera unaccompanied by any of his colleagues, and he suggested that the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General should be present with him.  Mr.  de Valera replied that  he would not come unless he could see the Prime Minister  alone, at any rate in the first instance.    The Prime Minister  there- upon agreed to receive him alone in the first  instance, andMr. de Valera reached Downing Street about 7.50 p.m.
                wots,OF. DISCUSSION.        The Prime Minister and Mr, de Valera had a conversation alone for about a quarter of an hour.   The Lord  Chancellor then joined them.   About 80 ZO p.m. , the Prime Minister called the Attorney-General into the room.        The Prime Minister stated that it was clearly understood that the conversations were to be without prejudice.   He also submitted a suggestion made by Mr. de  Valera that the Prime Minister had sent for him to come  to London.   The Lord Chancellor asked Mr.  de Valera a number of questions with regard to the new proposal for a commission of four persons.   Mr. de Valera, in dealing with  that part of the propooal referring to negotiation for a settlement after the Commission had reported,  said that he had no doubt the British Government were under the impression that by the action they were talcing they would force Mr. de Valera to have a General Election with the result that a new Government would be substituted for the present one.    The British Government were making, on this occasion, as often in the past, a profound mistake;&quot; the Irish people were in a resolute mood and there was no intention on his part of having an Election., nor any like- lihood  of any change in popular feeling, v/hich at  present strongly supported him.       The discussion then passed to a consideration of the proposal for arbitration.   Mr.  de Valera expressed the opinion that no question of principle was involved, and by  way of illustration of his contention that an empire tribunal was not  obligatory, he referred to a state-men t made in the course  of one of the debates to the effectthat if Canada and Australia chose to arbitrate before a                           -2-
 The Attorney-General  intervened to say that, as he saw it,  apart altogether from the question of the effect of the Imperial Conference, 1930, the question of principle at stake was v/hether the British Government could possibly take a step which would lend colour to the suggestion  made by Mr. de Valera that if the matter were referred to an Empire Board the dice v/ould he loaded against the Irish Free State Government.    This he thought would be a slur upon the Members of the Common- wealth to which the British Government could not be expected to make themselves a party.    Mr. de Valera replied that he understood the Attorney-General&apos;s point, hut  he did not think that there was much in it.    However, he  recognised that unless one of the two parties was pre- pared to recede from the position taken up as to the constitution of the tribunal there was a deadlock.    He added that even if there was a name within the Empire which would be acceptable to him he could not now possibly propose or accept such a name, as it  v/ould be said that he was going back upon his demand for freedom of  choice. As a matter of fact, he had no such name in mind.   Heand his Ministers had not the same opportunity of  becomingfamiliar with persons of high judicial standing withinthe Empire or, for that matter,  outside the Empire,  as the British Government had.       The discussion then returned to the new proposal that a commission of  four persons,  two to  be appointed by each Government,  should consider  the  circumstances, and makea report as a basis of negotiation  for a  settlement.  Mr.
9 9 the difficulty of the choice  of  a chairmen  of an arbitration tribunal.    Even if there were two  reports, representing the two sides  in the dispute, one advantage would be that the Irish Free State case would be explained to the Irish people. The impression had got abroad in  Ireland, as well as elsewhere, due to the misrepresentation of the Irish Free State case,  that the Irish Free State had made an agreement and had broken it, and he wished  to remove this impression by a correct and full statement of what their real case was. The Attorney-General  reminded LIr.  de Valera that the opinions&apos; of six lav/yers on his side as well as of six lawyers on Mi1.  CosgraveTs side had already been published, to which Mr.  de Valera  replied that the six lawyers who reported in favour of  the  present Irish Free  State Governments contention had made their report  in a technical form, which was not likely to be read by the  public, whereas Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s lawyers had made their statement in a more popular form,  and it  had been issued as part of Mr.  Cosgrave&apos;s election propaganda.        The Prime  Minister laid stress upon the complete absence of finality in the new proposal.    He  referred to the  proposal that  negotiation should begin afresh after the  commission had issued their reports,  and said that  such negotiation might  drag  on for weeks or  for months, and meanwhile relations between the tv/o Governments would become  more difficult.   He elicited from Mr.  de Valera the  statement  that what he meant by negotiation for a settlement was a  discussion of what it  was fair   should  be
 paid.   Mr-  do Valera made it  plain that he wished to go behind the two agreements  of 1923 and 1926, stating that he v/as of  opinion  that a fair  settlement would not merely leave the  Irish Free  State under no liability to make any payment but  would  require  the  British Government to pay a considerable sun to the Irish  Free State-        At  this point  in the discussion the Prime Minister wrote down on a sheet of paper tne position as he saw it, and read  it out  to Mr. de Valera.   He said the first alternative v/as arbitration0 in which  case the steps which ought to be taken immediately were:-       1.   to  settle  the terms of reference, and       2o   to  settle  the composition of the tribunal. If, however,  that was  ruled out, the other course was negotiation,  and he asked Mr.  de Valera whether he had any other  suggestions to make.    Mr.  de Valera agreed with the statement made by  the Prime Minister.    After a good deal  of desultory conversation as to the deadlock, the Prime Minister  said that he thought at any rate it v/as desirable  that  contact should be maintained, and he suggested  that  each Government might appoint two or three persons to continue to discuss the points at issue.Mr,, de Valera said that it  would be difficult  to proceed with  such  discussions  immediately owing to the limitations of the Irish Free State Government.    The  British Treasury v/as a Government machine of unrivalled efficiency, and no doubt on the British side discussions cculd begin v/ithin afew days.   The Irish Free  State  Government, however,  v/as not similarly equipped? and it  v/ould require some time  before they would be in a position to  carry on  negotiations.   Mean-while an economic war had been  declared, and it  was necessary in his opinion if there was to  be any negotiation for  theBritish Government  to suspend what he called the  &quot;marchingorders&quot;.   He recognised that it  v/as difficult for  the  British
 Government to suspend action, as  they had not merely taken power to impose  duties,  hut had actually imposed them, whereas the Irish Free State  Government had not yet imposed any customs duties, hut  he regarded it as essential, if any discussion was to  go  on  between persons appointed by the two Governments, to suspend hostilities.   Otherwise the, Irish Free State Government would have no time to discuss matters  as all their  energies would be concentrated upon the ,war&quot;.       The Attorney-General asked whether, in the event of the duties being taken off, Mr.  de Valera would be prepared to  consider a proposal to resume the payments that had been stopped, it being understood that any sums so paid would be repaid if  it  v/as ultimately decided that the Irish Free State  Government was not liable.    This v/as a practice very familiar  in the course of litigation in the courts when provision had to be made for the circumstances pending an  appeal.   Mr. de Valera declined to consider an;/ proposal of this sort.   He said their decision to pay  the monies into a  suspense account was ample evidence of their good faith.    The Prime Minister more than once pointed out that if there v/as to be a suspension of the duties there ought  to be a  complete return to the status quo which the Irish Free State Government had been the first  to disturb.       The conversation continued without  any progress being made or agreement reached.    The Lord Chancellor  hadbeen obliged to leave at 8c45 in order to  attend the Judges&apos; dinner at the Mansion House,  and did not return until 9.50.He. resumed discussion v/ith Mr.  de Valera on the points  above mentioned.    The Prime Minister  intervened about  12*155  by saying that he thought further conversation that night  v/as not  likely to lead to any result.     Mr.  de Valera agreed
and said the only thing remaining to he done was  to  agree upon a statement to he issued to the press.,    This  state-ment was then settled and subsequently issued..   (Goviyattached as Appendix I).
