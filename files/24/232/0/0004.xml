         Agreed Resolution at Disarmament Conference8     1.   A great effort is being made to bring to an endthis week the present session of the Disarmament conference by  an  agreed resolution on certain aspects of disarmamentwhere  a measure of common ground has been discovered,  TheUnited Kingdom delegation has &quot;been asked to draft such aresolution and negotiations have been proceeding with the americans, the French, and many others, with a view tosettling its terms.   There is an overwhelming desire atGeneva to record a substantial amount of progress, while at  the same time everyone recognises that many importanttopics afford little hope of unanimity, at any rats with--out further discussion0     2.   There are two or three points in the resolution on  which Cabinet authority is needed, hut at the same time it  should be explained that the resolution will he movedhy  Dr. Benes, the Rapporteur, and not by the UnitedKingdom delegate personally,,     3.   The greatest difficulty arises ahout Air Bombing.The Cahinet has already heen warned that a very awkwardsituation threatens the United Kingdom delegation.President Hoover has proposed to abolish bombing machines and all bombing.   Practically every delegation agrees with him except the Japanese and the French.    But theFrench are weakening.   There is a real danger that at   ^the end of this week we may find ourselves alone (savefor the Japanese) in resisting the principle of the                                            proposal.  ...
proposal.   (Of course,  its application in practice and possible exceptions are reserved;   and no  resolution isoperative in the end unless everyone agrees).     40   The sort of paragraph which might pass musterwould he one which, after declaring that air attack on thecivil population should be prohibited, then presented analternativeo      E,ge  &quot;Air attack against the civil  population shall     &quot;be prohibited.   With this object in view, the High     &quot;Contracting Parties shall agree either upon the     &quot;absolute prohibition as between themselves of hom-     &quot;bombardment from the air, or, failing a general agree-     &quot;ment on such prohibition, on provisions defining     &quot;strictly the limits within which alone bombardment     &quot;from the air may take place8&quot;     53   But I greatly fear that there will be a movementat Geneva to omit the second alternative *    We shall thenbe faced with a vote on the question whether,  in principle,bombing from the air is to be prohibited.    A politicaland international situation of great gravity would thenarise which I summarise thus,          (a)  Britain will be put up against the wall and     challenged by practically every other Power.   Japan     is the only certain exception.   Prance,  seeing how     things are going, will lie low.   Is  it the wish of .     the Cabinet that the British representative should     none the less resist the proposal almost single-     handed?          (b)   The United States, acclaiming the Hoover     Plan, will watch our attitude and probably urge     publicly that abolition is the only effective remedy.     All the small States will say so loudly,,
JOHN SIMON,     11th July,  1932,          (c)   It will be impossible to state the argu-     merits which lead to the view that the right to bomb     should be preserved.   Those arguments are (1) that     agreements will not be kept, (2) that, if the enemy-     bomb Londons  we should bomb their air-bases,  and so     reduce the attack.   The Air Ministry claim that     without an air force of our own London might be     annihilateds,  but it has always to be remembered that     the Air Ministry do not represent that their bombing     planes can defend. London in any other sense than by     bombing elsewhere.   I quite appreciate the arguments;     but how should they be advanced at Geneva?          (d)   I  cannot exaggerate the concern with which     I regard the  possible political and international     consequences,   We are risking the loss of American     sympathy,  and almost universal condemnation at Geneva,     with widespread condemnation from public opinion here     and all over  the world0     60   I have fully in mind earlier Cabinet discussions and decisions,  but the international and political situa-tion in which we find ourselves is a new fact.   What does the Cabinet wish  the United Kingdom Delegation to do?
