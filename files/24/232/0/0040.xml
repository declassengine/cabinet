               CABINET.  Memorandum by the Home Secretary and  the     Secretary of State f cr Scotland.          The question of the second, instalment of the cut in police pay has &quot;been referred  to a Cabinet Committee whichhas held two meetings, and which will no doubt meet  againafter the return cf the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who isits Chairman.   But as this matter may  give rise  to  a situation of great difficulty;, we think that the  cabinet should be reminded srf the precise terms of the undertakings given on behalf of the Government a year ago,   We. do not,at this stage, put forward any definite proposal.          It will be remembered  that when the national government, as first constituted,, took  in hand the questionof cuts in expenditure, there was no certainty that  therewould not be serious trouble in  the police force  - such asin fact subsequently occurred in the navy.   The  matterrequired careful handling? and certain  assurances weregiven to the police as to the possibility of setting off   ^other economies in police expenditure against the necessityof imposing the full reductions  in pay  that were  suggested,the budgetary savings that were  contemplated being fully safaguarded in any event0   These assurances were based uponthe following decision of the Cabinet,  which is recorded in the Conclusions of the meeting of September 1st,1931, as its approval of one of  tho recommendations  ofthe Cabinet Committee on Economy;,-                           - c[fflBIMWIMMiiiiliiiiiiiiifflWiHW                    mirfi DOCUMENT  IS Trhii PROPERTY  Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMMT.)j!

   n          &quot;(a) That in the case of any Department required     to effect economies in tho present emergency, the     Department should have discretion, after consultation     and in agreement with the Treasury, to realise the     economies-in th.e,Jb,es.t.....manner attainable, provided     thAt the amount so realised is not less than the     economy figure as determined by tho Cabinet.   The     economies are in general stated as the reductions which     will be made in Estimates for 1932.   Savings should     also be effected in the current year by bringing into     operation the economy measures proposed at  the earliest     possible date^c          On September 4th the Police Council held ameeting, in pursuance of a summons that had been issuedby the Home Secretary in the previous Government.   Itwill bo remembered that this Council is a body, set up by statute^ consisting of representatives of the Home Office, ofthe Police Authorities, and of the several ranks ef the police force, including representatives of the Police Federation.There is a statutory obligation to consult the Police Councilon all important matters- relating, inter alia, to pay.   Atthat meeting,,  the present Home Secretary,  basing himself uponthe Cabinet decision which has been quoted, made the followingstatementsr-          &quot;We are     restricted, as I mentioned last     week, to the May ^OT^I Recommendations.    So     long as the financial result on which the Exchequer     relies is not affected we can vary the procedure     which may be adopted in order to secure it5 and I     have obtained confirmation of that from, the.-Cabinet,&quot;          &quot;If it is understood that the sum cf money     which is contemplated will be available in the second     year, that is all that the Chancellor of the Exchequer     desires to know at this stage.   The regulation to be     made by the Home Office immediately the new legislation     is passed will refer rcnly to the first year from now^     this October to next October^   It will be after that     period tha*o a&quot;&quot;regulation will be made covering the     conditions of the second year, and if it is found     tha u economies have been made and so forth, and that     there may be-som^^arj.atie^,j^jthe^ratgs in the second     year3 then those&quot;iay&quot;be1 erfeVtrea^a^^nat time, provided.     tnat tho total sum which Is contemplated is provided&quot;.          On September lOthj the White Paper, which was thefull official statement of the Government&apos;s economy proposals.,was presented to Parliament,   The relevant paragraph was as followss-
              &quot;The expenditure on the police falls half on        the rates and half on the Exchequer and the Exchequer        consequently receives half the benefit of any savings        secured in the expenditure on this service.   Savings        in expenditure amounting to  2,000,000 are to be made        in two equal instalments, the savings to the Exchequer        being thus  500,000 in the first year and  1,000,000        in the second year.   Some of this reduction of ex-        penditure will be secured by&quot;&quot;the introduction of lower        rates of pay for new entrants to the service and various        admin&quot;! st rat I ve measures, but savings of this order        cannot be secured without substantial sacrifices on the        part of serving members of the forces.   The May        Committee recommended a reduction in the pay of all        ranks at the rate of &amp;\ per cent, in the first year and        12-1 per cent, in the second year, but after consultation        with the English and Scottish Police Councils, on which        the police authorities and all ranks of the Service are        represented, it has been decided to make instead deduc-        tions from pay on a graduated scale according to rank,        commencing at 5s. weekly for constables., whose scale        ranges from 70s,, to 95s. a week.   These deductions will        continue.for a year from the 1st October, 1931.        Additional savings of similar amounts are to be secured        in the second year and will involve further substantial        sacrifices on the part of the oolice, but the detailed        measures are reserved for further consideration,.   It        has further been decided to institute a comprehensive        enquiry as soon as possible into police pension condi-        tions,&quot;             On September 12th, there was issued from the HomeOffice to Police Authorities. Chief Constables, the PoliceFederation, and the Police Press, an &quot;Approved Summary of theProceedings of the Police Council&quot; in which the following para-graph appeared:-             &quot;So long as it TOS understood that additional        savings of equal amount v,would   be forthcoming in the        second year, the Police Council would certainly be        given an opportunity to consider the detailed measures        to be taken.   The deductions from pay would accordingly        be limited in the first instance to a year from the 1st        October, but would be renewable by further regulation at        such rate as might be found necessary after further re-        view by the Police Council, and, in the meantime, all        possible means of securing savings by administrative or        other methods would be explored,&apos;&apos;&apos;             The view takexi of these assurances by the police forces was expressed in a leading article in the &quot;Police Review&quot;of September 18th, 1931, of which the following is an extract:-
        &quot;Some of the reduction in expenditure  (v/e again   quote the Memo.) &quot;will be secured by the introduction   of lower rates of pay for new entrants to  the Service   and  various a drain i s t r at-iv-es . m e;: stir e s     The detailed   measfu^e^for&quot;&quot;effectllnig ttie additional savings of   similar amount (i.e. , double the present saving) to   be secured in the second year are reserved for further   consideration.&quot;   Among these detailed measures the   Police are not by any means entitled to rule out the   possibility of a further supplementary deduction from   pay.   The amount of this would depend upon the saving   effected by the introduction of lower rates of pay   for  new entrants and by savings on administration.   Somehow or other a saving roughly equal to twice the   present &quot;cut&quot; is to be effected as from October, 1932.&quot;       The Home secretary also mads the two followingstatements.    In the House of Commons on September 25th:-    &quot;Furthermore the Rome Office and the Police Councilagreed that instead of the whole of these economiesfalling upon the pay of the various ranks of tne force,as much as possible should be effected by administrative economies. &apos;r&apos; &quot;&quot;(Debates&quot;,&quot;&quot;C&apos;6Tr&quot;-lS9?j       And at the Central Conference of the Police Federa-tion on November 12th, as reported in the &quot;Police Review&quot;for November 20th:-       &quot;The Police got respite so far as one^half is con-   cerned, and during that respite we want to consider   most carefully whether it will not be possible to make  .larger administrative ecbnojaifes^in Police expenditure,   so -. tnat the mSfrey&quot;&quot;requ 1 rea 5y &quot;the  ExcTTequer shall not   come wholly from the pockets or the members&quot; or the&quot;&quot;&quot;   Force.       We are going into that most carefully, and the Home   Office is very much alive to the desirability of that   object.   He have received a number of suggestions which   are being carefully examined.   I can assure you that   the Home Office are very, desirous of securi ng alH   possible economies in order to avoid.. &apos;so far a&apos;s may be,   thev&quot;enT  ^      :c                     th    J :   hair   of the       Meantime the Secretary of State for Scotland had givensimilar assurances.    At a meeting of the Scottish police council, held on September 4th, 1951, he said:-       &quot;The May Committee recommended a 12-g.yfe cut in pay,   this cut to be made in two equal instalments, one of   which would take effect at once and the other alter a   year&apos;s interval.-    It might be that the Council would   think of possible ways of effecting the necessary   economies otherwise than by a reduction of pensionable  pay,   He was prepared to consider any suggestions of this kind   and for the assistance of the Council in this matter a   Memorandum giving a few important particulars of Police   costs under various heads had been circulated to each   member.11
9J5 7k 1 I       &quot;The Prime Minister&apos;s statement would show that all   classed were being called upon to melee sacrifices and it   was essential that he should be able to say what was to   be done as regards the  Scottish Police.   The possibility   of administrative economics had been put at the end of the   economy proposals not as an -After thought but because such   measures did not provide any hops of immediate savings,   although they would help in the vital second year.&quot;        vVe submit to the Cabinet that those assurances cannotbe treated as non-existent.   They were based upon a definiteCabinet decision, and upon a Parliamentary paper issued withthe full authority of the  Government.   They took the form ofpublic declarations in parliament and elsewhere, which were notquestioned at the time by  the Treasury of by any member of theCabinet.    If the Police Porce were now to be told that theCabinet intended to ignore these undertakings, and if troublewere to break out in the police forces as a consequence, the Government&apos;s position would be an  impossible  one.    The public statements would necessarily be quoted  in Parliament and else- where;  the Ministers concerned would be bound  to state that they;; had not acted without Cabinet authority;  the result would in- inevitably be that Parliament, and public opinion in general, would hold that, in the controversy that had  arisen,  the police force were in the right and the Government in the wrong.   And if the matter were to be referred to any  Committee or  to any form of arbitration, it cannot be doubted  that  that conclusion would be reached.   He submit, therefore, that in any  settlement of the matter, which will involve in any  case  complicated calculations                                                              jt::J\:&apos; of the amount of economies actually achieved, the pledges that v/ere given cannot be ignored.(intl&apos;d&apos;d)  H.S.(   IT   )  A.S.Ira August, 1932.
