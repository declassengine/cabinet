is Document is  the property of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.                          CABINET                        ,o                  CIRCULAR on SECONDARY SCHOOLS.                 I      Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Education.?.259(32).            The effect of the attached Circular is,  while  safe-   guarding the interests of the clever child of poor parents  in   obtaining free secondary education,  t*- secure  that adequate fees   are charged to parents who can afford to  pay them.    The May   Committee made a general recommendation on this matter, but it   was not  adopted by the Cabinet last  September  because  the   proposals in the form then suggested were difficult  to bring   into operation and were unnecessarily contentious, and  economy   would only be slowly achieved.Maclean last Spring when it became apparent that the need for economy was likely to continue for a considerable period andhe decided to put into operation a scheme of this nature.Shortly before his death he had formulated the main outline ofthe scheme now embodied in the Circular which had been worked out in conjunction with the Advisory Committee of the LocalEducation Authorities and the actual proposals are now as littlecontentious as possible.coming financial year Local Authorities and Schools will requireto have notice by the early part of September at the latest inThe proposal was revived by my predecessor Sir DonaldIf the scheme is to operate from the beginning of theorder that they may make the necessary arrangements.Unlessmy colleagues raise any objection I propose to issue the circular at pnce.I R W I N.22nd July, 1932.
Circular                BOARD  OP  EDUCATION                  Seconda.ry Schools.     1.   The Board propose within the next two months to issuerevised Regulations for Secondary Schools, to become operativeas from 1st April, 19330  In accordance with the prescribedpractice the Regulations will, in the first instance, be issued in draft.  Pending their issue the Board think that it may beof convenience to local education authorities and Governors tobe informed of the lines on which they propose to proceed.     2.   The requirements of the present Regulations in regardto fees and free places have been subjected to frequent criticism from responsible quarters such as the Select Committee on estimates of the Rouse of Commons, on the ground that they donot ensure that adequate fees are charged to parents who can afford to pay them.  It has been represented that there can beno justification for an arrangement whereby an authority bycharging no fees, or fees so low that they represent but a small proportion of the cost of the education provided, lays anadditional and inequitable burden on the Exchequer.  It has alsobeen represented that the system of awarding free places withoutany regard to the capacity of parents to pay is needlesslywasteful of public funds, and runs counter to the principle whichis now generally accepted that where educational awards are madeby public or quasi-public bodies the amount of any financial assist-^ance given should be determined according to the financial circumstances of the successful candidates.  It is also inequitablethat when free places are limited in number the award of a freeplace to a candidate able to pay a fee may result in the exclusion of a candidate not able to pay.     3.   These criticisms have for some time been engaging theBoard&apos;s attention, and they consider that the necessities of the
present time render it imperative that ve^steps should he taken without delay to meet them.   While ^theyN&amp;o not desire to curtail! the facilities which authorities and Governors atpresent offer for poor parents to obtain for their children the benefits of secondary education, it is their purpose to provide that, where parents apply for the total or partial remission of fees for their children, they should berequired to show that their circumstances justify suchremission and, further, that, in view of the small partef the c^st of the pupil&apos;s education at present generallycovered by the fee, the- amount of the fee charged to those who can afford to pay should approximate more closely to the cos.t ofthe education the pupil receives *will provide:-     (a) that in lieu of the present provision of Article 15,         provision should be made for the award, by open         competitive examination, of places (to be called         &apos;special&apos; places) which will entitle the holders         to total or partial remission of fees if the         circumstances of their parents warrant such remission         the minimum and maximum limits for the award of         &apos;special&apos; places being normally the same as those         allowed under the present Article 15;     (b) that except as provided for in (a), fees at approved         rates must be charged for all pupils.to require that the conditions for total or partial remission  of fees should be uniform for the whole country.   They contemplatoIn order to secure these objects the Regulations5The Board recognise that it would not be appropriato
for complete exemption from fees an income limit of from  5 toPA a week in the case of a family with one child, plus anadditional 10s. for each additional child, or an alternative scheme having equivalent effect *  In considering proposals putforward for approval by authorities and Governors, they will haveregard to the particular circumstances of the area in question and to the rates of fees to be charged-     6.   Again, as regards increases in existing fees, the Boarddo not desire to lay down any rigid standard, but they considerthat some increase may reasonably be looked for --/here the fee isat present below 15 guineas a year; and &quot;hile some regard may reasonably be had to the fees at present charged, they willordinarily hesitate in future to approve a fee of less than9 guineas.     Some authorities and. Governors may desire to include in their arrangements provision for some reduction of fees for pupi3.s over16 who have passed an approved First Examination.     Where a school contains a preparatory department the Boardconsider that the fee charged to pupils in that department shouldbe either the school fee or 15 guineas, whichever is the higher.     7.   It is not proposed that the arrangements referred toabove should normally apply to schools in receipt of direct grant,since the fees in such schools are in general relatively high,and variations of fee or of the proportion of free and fee-payingpupils do not affect the grant payable by the Board to suchschools.   Provision will accordingly be made in the Regulations    )for a continuance of the existing provisions relating to fees and free places in the case of schools in receipt of direct grant,subject to a proviso that the admission of a qualified candidateshall be treated as the award of a free place if he holds ascholarship awarded by an authority which covers such part of thetuition fee and of any entrance fee as is determined under&quot;approved-ed arrangements to be appropriate to his financial circumstances.                                3.
     8.   The Board, are aware of the difficulties which nay heinvolved in any proposal for obtaining increased fee income from existing pupils; but in view of the financial exigencies of the time and in the absence of a solution of any legal difficulties vhich nay be involved they think thatauthorities may reasonably consider the propriety of askingparents of fee-paying pupils already in the schools on1st April,1933,.to pay. the increased fees, where they can afford to do so.   In the case of pupils admitted- after1st April, 1933,  authorities and. Governors will wish toconsider how far provision should be made for the reviewof initial awards where there is a change in the parents&apos;circumstances.       9.   If the new arrangements are to be brought intooperation on the 1st April next, it is important that theproposals of authorities, and of Governors of schoolsmaintained by authorities, should he submitted for the examination and approval of the Board not later than the1st January next.  The Board accordingly hope thatauthorities and Governors will give the matter their early consideration both individually and, where necessary, inconsultation.
