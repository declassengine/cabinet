Si        [This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1932.SECRET.CP. 266 (32).                                                Copy No                                  CABINET.                         COMMUNAL  DECISION.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR INDIA.    1.  I  submit to my colleagues  herewith the announcement which I recommend should be made containing His Majesty&apos;s Governments communal  award.  These proposals are the result of very full consultation with the Viceroj&apos;, who has  consulted the members of his Council, and with the Governors.  I have circulated the lengthy correspondence on  the  subject to the Cabinet  Committee.  In all essentials these proposals may  be said to have the approval of the Viceroy and his Council (though on a few points Sir Fazl-i-Husain and Sir B. L. Mitter  dissent)  and also of all the Governors, with the exception of the Governor of Bengal.  The  divergence of opinion as regards Bengal is discussed in para. 5 below.    2.  The present  award is limited to  the question  of method  and quantum  of representation  in the Lower Houses of the Provincial Legislatures.    There was  very nearly unanimity in the conclusion that we  should not  give any decision, at all events at present, on other aspects of the Constitution which  affect the communal issue,  as, for example,  the  question  of  minority representation in the Cabinets and the constitutional relations between the Centre and the Provinces.    I have somewhat reluctantly omitted any mention  of communal  proportions in the Federal Legislature, but  it  has been found impossible to deal with  this without prejudging questions  relating  to  the method  of election to the Federal Legislature and the representation of the States therein, which are not yet quite  ripe for decision.    3.  An analysis of the various communal percentages is attached, but I think it would be useful to  those  of my colleagues who have  not read the fall text of the correspondence with the Viceroy to give some explanation of the principles underlying the decision which I recommend should be given.    The size of the Provincial Councils is approximately doubled.  Separate electorates are  retained for all the  minority communities and  also for Muslims in Bengal and Punjab, though in those Provinces they are in a majority.  In all existing Provinces, except Bengal and the Punjab (see paras. 4 and 5 below), the number of Muslim seats is increased so as to retain as nearly as possible the same proportion of seats as they now have in the existing. Councils if the  official bloc be left out of  account.  This proportion is everywhere in  excess  of their population  ratio and in many instances. very largely in excess.    Subject  to  one  or two exceptions,  the number  of  seats for Indian Christians,. Anglo-Indians and territorial seats for Europeans go up  approximately in proportion to the increase in the size of the Legislatures.   The Commerce  and  Industry, Mining- and Planting seats have, in  accordance with the recommendations of the Franchise Committee, been kept at their existing numbers except in Bengal and Assam.   In these two Provinces  the European special  seats  have been  increased  to about 50 per cent. above their present figures (with increases also in Indian special seats of this character). The special Landholders&apos;  seats are,  as recommended by the Franchise Committee, kept at their present figure.  Special Labour seats have been allotted in the numbers recommended by the  Franchise Committee.   Special seats for women have been included in every Legislature  except the  North-West Frontier Province  and will number  about  3  per cent,  of the  total  House.  It has been found  necessary to communalise the special \Vomen&apos;s  seats, although no recommendation to this effect was made by the Franchise Committee.   The Depressed Classes have been given a number of special seats to be filled fromspecial Depressed Class electorates, while they retain also, when duly qualified^ votesin the general Hindu constituencies.   The number of  these special Depressed Classesseats has inevitably been assigned somewhat arbitrarily.  Roughly speaking, they arein Southern  India rather above, and in the rest of  India rather less, than half the     1083   60  7.32

July 1932.Copy No.CABINET.COMMUNAL  DECISION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.    1. I submit to my colleagues herewith the announcement which I recommend should be made  containing His  Majesty&apos;s Governments communal award.  These proposals are the  result of very full consvdtation with the Viceroj7, who has  consulted the members of his Council, and with the Governors.  I have circulated the lengthy- correspondence on the subject to the  Cabinet  Committee.   In all essentials  these proposals may be said to have the approval of the Viceroy and his Council (though on a few  points  Sir Fazl-i-Husain and Sir B. L. Mitter dissent) and also of all the Governors, with the exception of the Governor of Bengal.  The divergence of opinion as regards Bengal is discussed in para. 5 below.    2. The present award  is  limited to the question of method  and quantum  of representation in  the Lower Houses of the Provincial Legislatures.    There was  very nearly unanimity in the conclusion that we should not give any decision, at all events at present, on other aspects of the Constitution which affect the communal issue,  as, for example,  the  question  of minority representation in the Cabinets and the  constitutional relations between the Centre and the Provinces.

An  analysis of the various communal percentages is attached, but I think it would be useful  to those of my colleagues who  have not read the full text of the correspondence with the Viceroy to give  some explanation of the principles underlying the decision which I recommend should  be given.    The size of the Provincial Councils is approximately doubled.  Separate electorates are retained for all the  minority  communities and also for  Muslims in Bengal and Punjab, though in those Provinces they  are in a majority:  In all  existing Provinces, except Bengal and the Punjab (see paras. 4 and 5 below), the  number of Muslim seats is  increased so as to retain  as nearly  as  possible the same proportion of seats as they now have in the  existing. Councils if the official bloc be left out of account.   This- proportion is everywhere in excess of their population  ratio and in many instances- very largely in excess.    Subject to  one or two  exceptions,  the number of  seats for Indian Christians,. Anglo-Indians and territorial seats for Europeans go up  approximately in proportion to the increase in the size of  the Legislatures.   The Commerce and  Industry, Mining and Planting seats have, in accordance with the recommendations of the Franchise Committee, been kept at their existing numbers except in Bengal and Assam.   In  these two Provinces the European special  seats have been increased to about 50 per  cent. above their present figures (with increases also in Indian special seats of this character). The special Landholders&apos; seats are,  as  recommended by the Franchise  Committee, kept at their present figure.   Special  Labour seats have been  allotted in the numbers recommended by  the Franchise  Committee.  Special seats  for women have  been included in every  Legislature except the North-West Frontier Province  and will number  about 3  per  cent, of the  total House.   It  has been found necessary to communalise  the special Women&apos;s  seats, although  no  recommendation to this  effect was made by  the Franchise Committee.    The Depressed Classes have been given a number of special seats to bo filled fromspecial Depressed Class electorates, while they retain also, when duly qualified, votesin the general Hindu constituencies.   The number of these special Depressed Classesseats has inevitably beeu assigned somewhat arbitrarily.  Roughly speaking, they arein  Southern India rather above, and  in the rest  of India rather less, than half the     1083   60 7.32
2number to which they would  be entitled on  then-  population ratio.   These specialDepressed Class seats are taken in  all cases out of the Hindu quota.   This arrauge-ment-for Depressed Classes terminates at the end of 20 years (if not  revised  earlier,see para. 6 below).Punjab.    4. The solution proposed in the Punjab-is built  up on the following plan.  an arbitrary  number of seats has been given to  the Sikhs; comparison with  theirexisting position is as follows : Existine:Proposed  Population  Per cent.    11-1(1921 census)    13-0(1931 census)Communal   SeatsIndian SeatsTotal Seats less  official blocPer cent.  17-9  19-5Per cent.  17-6  19-0Per cent.  17-3  18-9Total SeatsPer cent.  15-9  18-9    The Hindu  and Muslim territorial seats  are  divided  in  accordance with  their population ratio.  The special seats are not communally allocated, but they will  be/arranged so that in practice the communal result is more or less certain.  The upshot is that although the Muslim territorial seats, which will be  the only ones which will be statutorily allotted to  Muslims, will form only 49*2 per cent, of the whole House, the Muslims will, in fact, have 89 seats out. of 174 after leaving on one side one seat for the Speaker, who will probably  be a  Muslim.   The  Muslim majority might conceivably fall from four to two if they fail to  secure one of the Labour  seats which is the only special seat as regards the allocation of which  there  can be  much doubt. The Hindus get slightly less than their population ratio of the total number of Indian seats, although Sikhs and Hindus, if considered together, have considerable weightage. The numbers proposed for  the Sikhs will undoubtedly fall  far short of anything that will satisfy them, but it is certain that  they will not accept any figure which would not either be manifestly unfair to the Hindus or would deprive Muslims of their majoritj&apos;.    The Viceroy is still considering a suggestion which  I  have made  that one extra seat should be given to the Sikhs and the total strength of  the House increased from 175 to 176.  This would give the  Sikhs 19 &quot;3 percent,  of the  total seats.  It would leave  the  Muslims with a  majority  of three (apart from the Speaker) or one it they fail to get  a Labour seat.   I will make  a final recommendation on this point shortly.Bengal.    5.  It is in Bengal that the greatest difficulties have arisen.   The  figures proposed are those recommended by the Viceroj&apos;&apos;.  They are as follows, the first figure in eachcase being the number of territorial seats and  the  second  figure the number which each community may be expected to get from the special seats :            Hindus (including-   Total    Depressed Classes)    Muslims    Indian Christians    Anglo-Indians    Europeans    250     80+18-98   119 + 2 = 121    2 + 0 = 2        4 + 0 = 4    11 + 14 = 25   The  essential  feature  is  that the Europeans  will  hold the balance  of  powerbetweeii the Hindus and the Muslims since the latter will not have a majority of thewhole House.   If Europeans and Indian Christians  and Anglo-Indians are left out of account, the rest of the seats (taking territorial and  special seats together) are divided between the Hindus and Muslims in accordance with their pojmlation ratio.   The Governor originally proposed 111 territorial seats for Muslims, the number ofHindu territorial seats being  correspondingly increased.  The basis for this proposal was  that the  territorial seats should  be  divided between Hindus  and  Muslimsapproximately in their population ratio, allowing the  Hindus  to get full advantage from the fact that almost all the Indian special seats would fall to them.   At one time suggested that the Muslims should  have 114 territorial seats only, with the object ofgiving  the Hindus, as a  minority community, slightly  more  than their populationratio among all  Indians (including Indian Christians and Anglo-Indians in this term),while preserving for Muslims a clear majority among  all Indians even  if they fail  toget the two special seats (Labour) which are expected to fall to them.  The differencebetween this proposal, which I made at an earlier stage, and the Viceroy&apos;s proposal is
merely that the special weightage given to Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians would,on his figures, be taken proportionately from Hindus and Muslims, whereas  on thefigures I then  suggested it woiild fall solely on the Muslim majority.  My proposalapproximated  more  nearly to the principles  applied in  the Provinces other  thanBengal and Punjab, whereas  the Viceroy&apos;s treatment  is  roughly similar to the plan for the Punjab.   While I was  still interchanging  views  with the  Viceroy on  these figures, theGovernment of India&apos;s  recommendations unfortunately began to leak.  Muslims in bengal became inflamed by the rumour that  they would not get  a majority in thewhole House.  At this stage the Governor submitted fresh recommendations in whichhe proposed that  the Muslims should have  a  bare majority of the  whole House for10 years  and  that at  the expiry of this period they should, if they still insisted onseparate  electorates, be  given only the  figures which I  had proposed.  The main reason underlying  this  fresh  proposal  was that special advantages  ought to begiven to the Muslims for a period during which they  might do something to diminishtheir present backwardness, and also  to give them a  solid encouragement to adoptjoint electorates at the end of the period of 10 years.   The Viceroy, who was in Calcutta at the time these fresh proposals were made,at first agreed with them  ; but he subsequent^ came to the conclusion  that  theywould be unwise and has reverted to his original  scheme, the acceptance of which heand the European members of his Council have pressed on me very strongly.  I agreewith the Viceroy  in  thinking  that the Governors later  plan has many undesirablefeatures,  and I recommend  that we should accept the Viceroy&apos;s proposals.   6. It is proposed that provision should be made in  the constitution to empower a revision of the terms of the present Award by Indians themselves at any time after aperiod of 10  years if  the communities  affected agree.   The precise constitutional machinery for this  provision  will have  to be  worked out in detail  later when the relevant part of the Constitution is being drafted.                                                                         S.  H.   INDIA OFFICE,       30th July 1932.
Draft (as at 30th July 1932) of Statement.COMMUNAL  DECISION.   In  the statement made by the Prime Minister on 1st December last on behalf  ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government  at  the close of the  second  session of the Round table conference, which was immediately afterwards endorsed by both Houses of Parliament,it was  made plain that if  the communities in India were unable to reach a settlement acceptable to all parties on the communal questions which the Conference had failedto solve His Majesty&apos;s Government were determined that India&apos;s constitutional advanceshould not on that account be frustrated, and that they would remove this obstacle bydevising and  applying themselves a provisional scheme.   2.  On the 19th  March last His Majesty&apos;s Government, having been informed  thatthe continued failure of  the communities to  reach agreement  was impeding theprogress of  the plans for the framing  of a new  Constitution, stated  that  they  were engaged upon  a careful  re-examination of the difficult and controversial questionswhich   arise.   That   re-examination  has  now  been   completed.   Meanwhile,examination in detail  of the stops necessary to implement their policy as indicated  ingeneral terms to the Conference has demonstrated even  more clearly  to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  the fact  that without a decision of at least  some aspects of the problems connected with  the position of minorities under the new Constitution, no  further progress can  be  made with the framing of the Constitution.   3.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  have accordingly decided that they will  include provisions to give effect to the  scheme  set out  below in  the proposals relating to theIndian Constitution to be laid in due  course  before Parliament.   The scope of thisscheme is purposely confined to the arrangements to be made for the representation  ofthe British Indian communities in the Provincial  Legislatures.  This decision  impliesno failure to  realise that the framing  of the Constitution will necessitate the decisionof a number  of other  problems of great  importance to minorities,  but has been takenin the  hope that once the  basic questions of method and  proportions of representationare removed  from the sphere of dispute and speculation, the communities themselvesmay find it possible to arrive at a modus vive?idi  on  other communal problems, whichLave not as yet received the discussion they require.   4.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  assumed  the responsibility, which the failure to arrive at,  agreement in India  has perforce imposed upon them, with the  greatestreluctance, as the only means of resolving an otherwise insoluble  deadlock.  Theyhave never  sought to disguise their conviction that no  decisions  upon issues  sofundamental  which are not based upon  mutual accommodation and agreement amongIndians  themselves  can  be regarded as forming a  satisfactory   foundation forresponsible   government.   Faced,  however, with  the  choice between  themselvesmaking a decision that is bound to draw criticism from many quarters or of leavinguntouched an obstacle that blocks almost every  path of constitutional development,they have reluctantly accepted the former of  these two alternatives.   Having taken this decision  it is both their desire and their duty to hold the scales  equally betweenthe various  communities  and to protect minorities  from the abuse of power at thehands  of majorities.   5.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  wish  it  to be  most clearly understood that  they themselves can be no parties to any negotiations  which  may be initiated  with a viewto the  revision of their decision, and will not be prepared to give consideration to auyrepresentation aimed  at securing the modification of it which is not supported by allthe parties affected.   But  they are most desirous to close no door to an agreed settle-ment should  such happily be forthcoming.   If,  therefore, before a new Government  ofIndia  Act has passed into law, they  are satisfied  that  the communities  who areconcerned are mutually agreed  upon  a  practicable alternative  scheme, either  inrespect of any one or more of the Governors&apos;  Provinces or in respect of the  whole  ofBritish India, they will be prepared to recommend to Parliament that  that alternativeshould be substituted for the provisions now outlined.   6.  Seats in the Legislative Councils  in  the  Governors&apos; Provinces,  or in the lower house if there is an Upper Chamber, will be allocated as shown in the annexed table&quot;:;;&quot;.   7.  Election to the seats allotted to Muhammadan, European and Sikh constituencieswill  be by voters voting in separate communal electorates covering between them thewhole  area of the Province  (apart from any portions which  may in special cases  be-excluded from the electoral area as &quot; backward  &quot;).                                    * See page S.
    Provision will be made  in  the  Constitution itself to empower  a revision  of this-electoral arrangement  (and  the other similar  arrangements mentioned below) after10 years with the assent of  the communities affected, for the ascertainment of whichsuitable means will be devised.    8. All qualified  electors, who  are not voters either in a Muhammadan, Sikh,Indian Christian (see 11 below), Anglo-Indian (see 12 below) or European constituency,will be entitled to vote  in a general constituenc)&apos;.    9. Seven seats will  be reserved for Mahrattas in certain selected plural membergeneral constituencies in Bombay.    10. Members of the &quot; depressed classes &quot; qualified  to vote  will vote in  a generalconstituency.  In view  of the fact that for a considerable period these classes would be unlikely, by this means  alone, to secure any adequate representation in the Legislature,a number of special seats will be  assigned to them as shown in the table.  These-seats will be filled by election from special constituencies in which only members ofthe &quot; depressed  classes&quot; electorally qualified will be  entitled to  vote.  Any  personvoting in such a special constituency will, as  stated  above, be also  entitled  to vote ina general constituency.  It  is intended that  these constituencies  should be  formed in selected areas where the depressed classes  are most numerous, and that, except inMadras, they should not cover the whole area of the Province.    In Bengal it  seems  possible that in some general constituencies a majority of thevoters will, belong to the  Depressed Classes.   Accordingly, pending further  investi-gation, no number has  been fixed for the members to be returned  from the  specialDepressed Class  constituencies  in  that Province.  It is intended  to secure that theDepressed Classes should obtain not less than 10 seats in the Bengal Legislature.    The precise definition in  each Province of those who (if  electorally  qualified)  willbe  entitled  to vote  in  the special  Depressed Class constituencies has not yet  been finally determined.   It will  be based as a rule on the general principles advocatedin the Franchise Committee&apos;s Report.  Modification may, however,  be found necessaryin some Provinces in Northern India where the  application  of the general criteriaof untouchability might result in  a definition unsuitable  in some respects  to thespecial conditions of the Province.    His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that these special constituencies  will berequired for more than a limited time.  They intend that  the  Constitution  shall provide that they shall  come to an end after 20  years if they have not previously been abolished under the general powers of electoral revision referred to in pai&quot;a.  7.    .11. Election to the seats  allotted to Indian Christians will  be by voters voting inseparate communal electorates.  It seems almost certain that practical difficulties will,except possibly in Madras, prevent  the formation of Indian Christian  constituencies-covering the  whole  area of the  Province ;  and  that accordingly special  IndianChristian constituencies will have to be formed only in one or two selected areas inthe Province.  Indian  Christian  voters  in these areas will not vote  in  a  genera).constituency.  Indian Christian voters outside these  areas will vote  in  a  generalconstituency.  Special  arrangements  may be needed  in Bihar  and Orissa, where aconsiderable proportion of  the Indian Christian community belong  to the  aboriginaltri bes.    12. Election  to the seats allotted  to  Anglo-Indians will be  by  voters voting inseparate communal  electorates.  It is at present intended, subject to investigation ofany practical difficulties that may  arise,  that  the Anglo-Indian constituencies shallcover the whole area of each Province, a  postal ballot  being employed ; but no finaldecision has yet been reached.    13. The method of filling the seats assigned for the representation of  aboriginesand hill tribes  is  still under  investigation, and the  number of seats so assignedshould be  regarded  as provisional pending a  final  decision as  to the  constitutional arrangements to be made in relation to &quot; backward tracts.&quot;    14. The seats specially allotted to women, of which the  numbers are shown inthe table, will be filled from communal constituencies.  The precise electoral  machinery to  be  employed is  still  under consideration.   Plis  Majesty&apos;s  Government  greatlyregret the necessity for &quot; communalising &quot; the seats reserved for women, but they areof opinion that the general adoption of electorates comprising women voters only wouldbe  undesirable,  and  they  have found it impossible to devise  electorates comprising &apos;and returning both men and women on a non-communal basis  consistently with the -remainder of the scheme for representation which they have found it necessary to adopt.
    15.  The  seats  allotted  to &quot; Labour&quot;  will  be filled  from  non-communal  con-stituencies.  The electoral arrangements have still to be determined,  but it is likely that in  most Provinces the Labour constituencies will be partly trade union and partlyspecial  constituencies as recommended by the Franchise Committee.    16.  The special seats allotted to Commerce and Industry, Mining and Plantingwill be filled by election through Chambers of  Commerce and  various Associations.The details  of  the  electoral arrangements  for  these  seats  must  await  further investigation.    17.  The special seats allotted  to Landholders will  be  filled by election by specialLandholders&apos; constituencies.    18.  The method to be employed for election to the  University seats is still underconsideration.    19.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have found it impossible  in determining thesequestions  of representation  in  the  Provincial  Legislatures to  avoid  entering  intoconsiderable   detail.    There  remains,   nevertheless,  the   determination  of  the constituencies.   They  intend  that this task should be undertaken  in  India as early as possible.    It, is possible that  in some  instances  delimitation  of  constituencies  might be materially  improved by slight variations  from  the numbers of seats now given.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  reserve the right to make such slight  variations,  for suchpurpose, provided that they would not materially affect the essential balance betweencommunities.   No such variations will, however, be made in the case of Bengal andPunjab.    20.  The question of the composition of  Second Chambers in the Provinces has sofar received comparatively little attention in the constitutional discussions and requiresfurther consideration before a decision is reached as to which Provinces shall  have aSecond Chamber or a scheme is drawn up for their composition.    His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the composition of the Upper House  in a province should be such as not  to disturb in any essential the balance  between the communities resulting from the composition of the Lower House.    21.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  do  not propose  at  present  to  enter into thequestion of  the  size and composition of  the Legislature at the Centre, since  this involves questions  of  representation  of  the Indian States which  still need  further discussion.   They  will,  of course, when  considering the  composition, be mindful ofthe interests of all communities to find adequate representation therein.    22.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have already  accepted the  principle  that Sindshould be constituted a separate Province, if satisfactory means of financing it can befound.   As the financial problems involved still have to be reviewed in connectionwith other problems of federal  finance,  His Majesty&apos;s Government have thought  itpreferable  to  include, at this  stage, figures for a Legislature  for  the existingProvince of Bombay, in addition to the schemes for separate Legislatures for BombayPresidency proper and Sind.    23.  The figures given for Bihar and Orissa relate to  the existing  Province.   Thequestion of constituting a separate Province of Orissa is still under investigation.    21.  The inclusion in the table of figures relating to a Legislature for  the  central provinces including Berar does  not  imply that any decision has yet been reachedregarding the future constitutional positiou of Berar.
