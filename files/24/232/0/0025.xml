HIS DOCUMENT IS TIE PROPERTY OP HISr* &quot;Q T? rP\j JLX Iii i.e,p,  S?&apos;5  (32).COPY NOC A B I N E T,THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION AND        CAPTAIN E.RHST HASHAGIFNT     I have to submit the following observations on the communication from the&apos; chairman of the British Broadcastingto the Corporation to confer with me,  I  saw Mr. &quot; hi tley?Lord Gainford  and Sir John Reith on Thursdays  July 7th9and informed  them that  the matter of  the broadcast by captain Eriist  Hashagen,  the German &quot;U&quot; Boat Commander, had&quot;been raised in Parliament and  that a  questL on  was  on  theOrder Paper that day to  the Minister  of Labour raising the desirability of a permit being granted to  CaptainHashagen in order that he might visit  th:L? Country andbroadcast on matters in  relation to the German submarine campaign in the Great Y/ar,     I told  them that the cabinet had unanimously expressed the  opinion (see paragraph  4       -*of Mr. Whit.leyrs letter) that  it was  very undesirable that.such a broadcast should  be given and  had expressed the strong desire  that in all the  circumstances the corporation should cancel  the talk.     I  stated  that  the  Cabinet regardedthis as quite  an exceptional matter,  that  :ihe  talk would raise bitter controversies and might  be  resented by a largesection of the Country.   I said that it was  the earnesthope of the Government  that the Corporation would  see their way to abandon the proposal.Corporation of the 28th ultimo.71(32).loFollowing an invitation given on Y/wednesday, July 6th
Hi     After considerable objection and contention that theobject of the talk had been wholly misconceived,Mr. \7hitley himself then drafted the Answer to theQuestion, which I gave in the House of Commons that afternoon intimating for the reasons then given thatthe Corporation had decided to abandon the broadcast.     As regards the point raised by Mr. Whitley concerningthe constitutional aspect of the issue,  the matter appearsto be quite clear and has been provided for in theLicence to the Corporation (Command Paper 2Y56).   ThePostmaster-General has under the terms of this Licenceswhich must be read with the Gharter9 complete power to prohibit any broadcast.   The Section is as follows s-     &quot;4  (3)  The Postmaster-General may from time to      time by Notice in writing to the Corporation      require the Corporation to refrain from sending      any broadcast matter (either particular or general)      specified in such Notice and the definition of      broadcast matter hereinbefore contained shall from      time to time be read construed and take effect      subject to the provisions of any such Notice or      Notices which may have been given by the Pootmrster-      General.   The Postmaster-General may at any time      or times revoke or vary any such Notice as aforesaid.                                                   -  i *  tIt is certainly wise that only in very exceptional circumstances should the power be used but its provisionsarc clearly  set forth  and are not capable of  anymisconception.     I have no knowledge of any  statement made by the  Postmaster-General in 13 27 that  this power would not be used  &quot;except in  time of national emergency&quot;and there is no such limitation in  the Licence.
3.It is certainly not my desireto invoke,  nor have Iinvoked, this power of prohibition which if generallyexercised would make me a Censor of the  programmes  of  theCorporation,    The matter was I understand regarded by theCabinet as quite exceptional and if desired I  will  againexplain the matter to the Corporation.(Signed)  KINGSLSVOOUGENERAL POST OFFICE,2nd August,  1932.
