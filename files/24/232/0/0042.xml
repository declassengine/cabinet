                                                          *?  QPROPOSED VISIT CP H,R,H,  THE PRINCE OF WALES TO COPENHAGEN          DURING THE EXHIBITIONS.  EXHIBITIONS,,       Two all-British exhibitions to be opened on  September the 24th:   (a)  General Display (to  close on  October the 9th);  (b)  Exhibition of Industrial Art (to  close  on October the 16th),&apos;  ORGANIZERS,       Union of  Danish Importers  of 3ritish Goods in collaboration with  the Dano-British Association, OFFICIAL RELATIONS.       The exhibitions have the full  approval and support of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,   H,R.H.  the Prince of Wales and the Crown Prince of Denmark are joint Patrons,  A special visit is being paid to Copenhagen by ships of the Second Cruiser Squadron and a flotilla  of  flying boats. The Department of Overseas Trade have despatched  a liaison officer., who will eventually be in charge of an official enquiry bureau in the General Exhibition;  they have co-operated in the assembling of the exhibits in the Art Section. FINANCE.      Except for approximately  650  (borne on the vote of the Department  of  Overseas  Trade)  the Exhibition is being entirely financed from Banish  sources.  Canvassing in this  country has been carried out by the Federation of British Industries.     It was  originally  intended by the promoters of  the Exhibition that His  Royal Highness should be invited to perform the opening ceremorry  (as in 1931  at the British  Empire Exhibition inBuenos Aires):  His Royal Highness was understood to be agreeable,   Realisingj  however,, ths-iTan  announcement to this effect might have undesirable repercussions during the
too 225  of   deliberations  at  Ottawa,  the Ministers were consulted by3rd)            telegram.  The reply  states:  &quot;V/e desire to submit to -.No, 277st  10th)     His Royal Highness the Prince  of Wales that it would be            preferable that no formal part should be taken by His            His Royal Highness in regard to opening of Exhibition at            Copenhagen and that His Royal Highness&apos;s visit to Denmark            should be of a purely personal nature; if it takes place.&quot;                This recommendation was communicated to           Bto James&apos;s Palace and to H.Mo Minister at Copenhagen,  and           it was decided that no announcement  should be  made at  this           stage.   A new factor  was,  however, introduced  into the           situation on Thursday last by  the leakage in Stockholm of           the news of the plans  made by  His Royal Highness  to visit           the King of  Sweden at  the  beginning  of October:   it is           therefore desirable that some  announcement  should be made           at  the  earliest possible moment about the intentions of           His Royal Highness with regard to Copenhagen,  Considerable           apprehension  exists in Denmark with regard to the           commercial relations between the two countries,  An          announcement that,  in spite of his visit to Copenhagen at          the end of September (a visit which will,  in any case,  take          place privately) s  His  Royal Highness will be unable to          open the Exhibitions  could net  fail  to have a most          unfortunate  effect  on Danish public  opinion.  It is to be          borne  in mind that, although unfounded,  the  impression  that          His Royal Highness  will open  the  Exhibition  eventually has          steadily gained ground and the  resulting disappointments          following on the publication  of the Ottawa Agreements, would          certainly detract from the  success of the  Exhibition and  its          potentially  considerable value  to our export  trade in          Denmark.   Moreover, both H.M.Minister  in Copenhagen and the
                                                           A* 0 UDanish Minister in London have urged unequivocally that, if at all possible, His Royal Highness should attend the formalopening ceremony.     It is submitted that consideration might be given tothe desirability of reversing the previous recommendation.
