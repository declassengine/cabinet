STATE OF TRADE - June,                Note by the Minister of Labour.          In the absence of the President of  the Board of     Trade, I circulate to ray colleagues a summary of the     reports submitted to the Board of  Trade  Advisory Council     on the state of trade in June,  1932.                                           H. B.Inistry of Labour.      July, 1932.
     Employment.   Compared with a month ago there was aslight decline in employment.  The number whollyunemployed, including casuals,  fell by 51,677,  while thenumber temporarily stopped rose by 57,714.  Employmentdeclined in the pottery, motor vehicle,  woollen and worsted and tailoring industries,  and in public workcontracting;  in coal mining alone the number temporarily stopped increased by over 8?,000.   There 7ms lessunemployment in the cotton, jute and textile finishingindustries, in the boot and shoe and distributive trades,in the iron and steel, printing and publishing and buildingtrades, in general engineering and iron-founding, thetransport, dock and harbour, and hotel and boarding-houseservices.  Unemployment increased in the Midlands, in north-Eastern England and in Wales;  in other parts ofGreat Britain it decreased.     Overseas Trade.   There was an excess of imports overexports of merchandise of  23.6 million in June or  9.5 million less than the corresponding figure for June 1931.Exports of United Kingdom manufactured goods in June werevalued at nearly  300,000 less  than in the previous month and  1.2 million more than in June 1931.     Rail and Road Transport.  Railway traffic receiptscontinued to decrease but at a  slightly diminished rate andthe general situation from the railway point of view wasnoticeably worse.  Compared with the corresponding periods of 1931 the percentage decline was 10.1 in Jure  and 10.2  inMay.  Up to the present the total receipts this year show                      ...                 STATE OP TRADE - JUKE 1958.Summary of Reports made to the Board of Trade  Advisory   Council in connection with their meeting on July 14th,   1932, (supplemented in some cases with information from   other sources).
a decrease of 8.68 per cent.  Passenger;  coal and coite;  andmerchandise receipts show in June percentage decreases of .7, 10.4, and 13.2 respectively compared with June 1931.The tonnage carried of low class merchandise (&quot;broadly speakingraw materials) declined in the same periods hy 15&apos;;J;  coal and coke hy 7.7% and other merchandise by 9%.     Revenue from  freight car loadings of goods and coal inthe United States have declined at a greater rate than in thiscountry,  the figures up to the 4th June showing that the decrease was 25$&apos;i compared with the corresponding period of 1931.     In British railway shops 61 per cent, of the men employedwere on short time.     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)registered for the first time in May show a decrease of about20$ compared with May 1931 - a heavier decrease than in any previous recent month.     The Committee dealing with the proposed pooling agreementbetween the North-Eastern and Midland Railways have completed their hearings and their report, together with the report ofthe Conference on the rail and road transport of goods (to beissued shortly), should provide further information, andpossibly some aoproach to a solution of the problems of suchtransport,     Coal Mining.   There was a general decline in employ-ment in coal mining compared with the previous month and      %with June, 1931;  temporary stoppages increased in everydistrict.   Towards the end of June the average number employed in the industry was over 42,000 less than in thecorresponding period of 1931.   The average weekly output per person for the 13 weeks ended 20th June v/as 4.91 tons,which was 0.03 ton less than in the corresponding periodof the previous year.      The  demand  for  coal  for                             -2-
inland consumption remained practically stationary.   Exportsshowed a decrease amounting in the aggregate to nearly 1.5 million tons during the first six months of 1932 comparedwith the corresponding period of 1931,  itself a very hadyear; the principal markets which showed increases in thesame period of 1932 compared with 1931  were the scandinavian countries and Brazil.  Shipments to Canada also increasedappreciably.  The export trade to foreign countries washampered by exchange and other Government restrictions!these difficulties were experienced generally by all exporttrades.     Iron and steel.   The number of blast furnaces inoperation has remained unchanged for three months.  The out-put of pig iron (311,400 tons in June)  was lower than in theprevious month and lower also than in June, 1931.  Productionof steel continued at a very low rate in relation to capacity although since her departure from the gold standardthe United Kingdom has been holding her own better than most other countries.  For June the output v/as 459,300 tons, anincrease over both May, 1932 and June,  1931, partly accountedfor by a contract for 40,000 tons of steel plates (now almostcompleted) for Russia;  it is stated that further business would be available in the same market if satisfactoryfinancial arrangements could be made.  Continental pricesremained at a low level, but the decrease of imports of semi-finished materials in South Wales is due rather to a weakerdemand than to an increased buying of British material.  the disparity between freight rates from this country and those from the Continent accentuates the difficulties of ourexporters.     Shipping and Shipbuilding.  The deepening depression inthe Shipping Industry was indicated by the index number of freight which was 73fc of the 1913 figure or 10 points lewer
than for the previous month and the lowest figure reportedsince the index figure started in 1920.   exchange difficulties tend to increase and thus add to the prevailingdepression.  Laid-up tonnage in this country increased byabout 22^i since April last.  A conference with representativesof foreign ship-owning countries has under consideration thequestion of schemes for laying up or scrapping a largeramount of tonnage.   The ship-building industry is at the lowest point reached for 50 years;,  one ship (a dredger forHussia) v/as launched and an order for one cargo ship was placed.     Machine Tools.  Exports during the month of June( 173,000) were the lowest for any month since Septemberlast, and  37,000 lower than in June 1931.  Difficultiesin obtaining credit insurance for exports to Russia werealleged to be hindering the acceptance of orders which werebeing offered from that country.  During 1931, 43S- of thetotal exports of machine tools from Germany were sent toRussia;  in the first 4 months of 1932 the correspondingproportion v/as 64;i.     Electrical Industry.  Although the electrical indusrty was working at rather less than 50^ capacity in June(compared with 60&quot;- in the previous month)  United kingdom manufacturers have not experienced the same degree of       jstagnation of business as that which is affecting Germanyand the United States.  The volume of orders for heavyplant for the home and overseas markets decreased; therewas little variation in the demand for lighter electricalmaterial.  The output of current for the first five monthsof this year showed an Increase of 8.5% on the correspondingperiod  of last year; this increase was largely due to domestic requirements.
     Motor Industry.  In the home trade there was thecustomary seasonal decline.   The export trade continued to hehampered hy exchange and other governmental restrictions, hutmarkets which have hitherto been monopolised hy United Statesgoods were being investigated by British manufacturers withencouraging results.  A satisfactory number of enquiries andthe shipment of over 20 cars were directly traceable to a motorexhibition recently held in Brazil, where British firms were represented;  the business which has thus been secured is inexcess of any that has been done by British makers in Brazilfor years.     Cotton.  A steady upward movement of prices was reported;the rise in Liverpool prices of raw cotton was partly due todepreciation of sterling, but there was also a real advance inraw cotton values in New York;  prices of yarns and standardcloths have moved in sympathy with raw cotton prices.  Atemporary recovery in activity followed the Whit-week stoppage,but after the first week in June production declined.  Sales inJune were rather larger than in April and May, but at thebeginning of July they were no higher than at the same timelast year.  Exports of piece-goods from Great Britain in Junewere lswer than in May, but higher than in June of last year;in spite of the expansion of Japanese trade in piece-goodswith India, British trade in similar goods with that country has increased steadily during 1932.  British exporters are,however, now suffering a decided disadvantage owing to the   ^fact that the depreciation of the yen has been greater thanthe depreciation af sterling.     Wool.  The price of wool advanced by 10% to 15% at  theLondon Sales.  These advances were accompanied by a good dealof business in tops, and a fair amount of business in yarns.Unless a  re-action  occurs the improvement should graduallyspread to all branches of the industry with a corresponding increase  in machinery activity.  The export of wool and worsted tissues in  June showed a decided increase over those
for the previous month and June 19? 1.   Since this country-left the Gold Standard fairly consistent headway has beenmade in foreign and British markets overseas;  exportersare, however, handicapped at present by the amount of their&quot;frozen assets&quot; in foreign countries, particularly Greece.     Silk and Artificial Silk.  The throwsters section ofthe silk industry was fully occupied.   The% spun silk tradewas depressed, owing largely to competition from Japanesespun striped piece-goods which, it was stated, were beingimported, in many cases, at prices below the value of theyarn from which they were made.    The hosiery trade wasquiet for the time of the year.   In the artificial silkindustry the home trade was rather quieter.   Specialrepresentations were being made to the Ottawa conference with regard to the great inroads vhich are being made intoEmpire markets by Japan, whose production of artificial silkyarn in 19^2 is likely to equal that of Great Britain.     Other Industries,  With the exception of the market for coal tar products  (which was at a standstill) almost every section of the chemical  trade showed an improvement,both in actual and prospective business, the mar*ket forpharmaceutical products, which has for some  time beenunsatisfactory, now sharing in the general advance.   Theproduction of boots and shoes  during Hay was lower  thanin Hay  1951.     Wheat Situation.  Continuous rains have somewhatdamaged the new winter wheat which was being harvested inthe United States;  the orop was not a heavy one.   The&quot;carry-over&quot; was large but  no  attempt was made to sell forexport;  the prospects for  the new spring crop were excellent.So far  as can be ascertained  the prospects for the  winterwheat orop  (now nearly ready  for harvest) in Russia are good and in  the opinion of  the Co-operative  wholesale society offers of wheat may be expected shortly from that
country.   The new crops in Argentina and Australia were stated to he good.     In Canada crop conditions are slightly below theaverage for the time of the year.   The visible supply ofwheat in that country v/as 149.2 million bushels at end ofMay compared with 164.5 million bushels on April 30th.Exports (from Canada) in Hay  were 15.5 million bushelsoompared with 7.5 million bushels in April but the level was greatly below that of May 1931.     Retail Trade.  Retail trade in May showed a decreasein money value of 5.9 per cent, compared with May 19?Ijfor the periods February-Kay the decline was 4.7 per oent.     The Co-operative Wholesale Society reported that forthe 4 weeks ended 4th June, oompared with the correspondingperiod of 1931 their sales declined by 1.7 per cent;   theprices of seven of the principal commodities combined(sugar, butter, flour, bacon, lard, cheese and tea)decreased by 10.06 per cent, after taking into consideration the volume of the respective articles sold by the Society.     Finance.  The outstanding feature of the month v/asthe scheme for the conversion of the sfo war loan v/hich, inOity circles, was considered to have been very successfullylaunched;  Its terms took the country by surprise.Following the reduction  in the Bank rate to 2$ bills werequoted  at the lowest rates since 1897.   &apos;There Is no indication of any renewed demand for advances for industrial purposes,   Oompared v/ith a year ago thefinancial outlook showed a distinct improvement and  theexchange position of this country was regarded as satisfactory.   The result of the Lausanne Conference hasbeen received with gratification.     One of  the important financial events in Germany wasthe purchase  of the majority  of the shares ofGelaonkirohner Bergwerks by the State whereby the latteracquired control  of Verelnigte Stahlwerke  (United Steel
Works), Suroipe^ largest and the world&apos;a second largest steelplant.  The transaction has given rise to severe criticismbecause the price paid (about 90 per cent.), seemed to be altogether out of proportion to the then ruling market price ofapproximately 35 per cent.     A certain amount of hoarding of currency was reported from the United states;  this was not attributed to fear ofthe dollar but to fear of the banks;  information from New Yorksuggested that there was little likelihood of that country being forced off the gold standard.  The Scandinavian countries are disposed to join in the Tariff Agreement between Holland,Belgium and Luxemburg but it appears that a definite decision is being held over until the results of the Ottawa conference are known.     Australian Trade. The following trade figures are in australian currency and include bullion end specie:  for the 11months ended in Way imports were valued at  61.5 millioncompared with  6^.5 million in the corresponding period of1930-31;  in the same periods exports increased from  92million in 1930-31 to  98.5 million in 1931-2.  Bank clearingsof all capital cities for the first six months of 1932 amountedto  936.7 million compared with   734.5 million in thecorresponding period of 1931.     Canadian Trade.  A resumption of lar.,e importations ofraw materials was a feature of Canadian trade for May.  Totalimports of merchandise in that month showed a gain of 17 per cent.over the preceding month, after seasonal adjustment;  the gain in exports was somewhat less than normal for the season.     Indian Trade.  The excess of imports over exports ofprivate merchandise which started in April was continued inMay;  compared with May 1931 the imports increased in May 1932by  321,000 and the exports decreased by  2,774,000.  the unfavourable balance of trade was corrected by the export ofgold.  Standing crops were in good condition and prospectsgenerally were stated to be fair.
     South American Trade. Exchange restrictions have become more stringent and severely handicap all trade operations;the political upheavals in Brazil and Chile have added greatly to business difficulties.  In none of the.South american countries was any improvement reported.  Argentina continued tomeet all her foreign obligations;  her imports during thefirst five months of 1932 compared with the corresponding periodof 1931 showed a decline of 38.5%;  her exports in the sameperiod increased by 3.8^O.  In Uruguay over-expenditure has created a very difficult position and the Government of thatcountry are proposing to take control of an accumulation of dollars (estimated at 30 million) which is awaiting remittanceto foreign countries.     Trade with Russia.  The Co-operative Wholesale Societystated that they had received orders for more than  50,000 worth of cloth for Russia.  The Scottish Co-operative wholesale society have made arrangements for financing the sale of100,000 barrels of Scottish Herrings to the RussianCentrosojus on terms which are regarded as reasonable.     It is stated that under an agreement made in June 1932,between the Soviet Trade Delegation in Germany and Germanindustrialists, Russia has placed orders for 60 million marksin Germany out of an anticipated total of 300 to 350 million marks during the current year, an amount which excludesorders for shipping and railway material.
