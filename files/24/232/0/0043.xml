I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on thestate of trade in July, 1932.                                          W.R.Board of Trade,     29th August, 1932.
CONFIDENTIAL.A.C.241.BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL*  STATE OF TRADE - JULY, 1933.Summary of Reports submitted &quot;by members of the Board  of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented In some    oases with information from other sources).     Employment *   Owing mainly to a trade dispute in the cottontextile industry in the Burnley district and to extended holidaystoppages in the jute industry in Dundee, employment at the endof July showed a decline compared with a month ago.   Industriesother than the cotton textile and jute industries showed little change.     All the divisions of Great Britain showed increases in umemployment in the same periods.   Scotland and North-east england were most acutely affected, these districts accounting for nearly 42,000 of the total increase of 64,000.   The numberwholly unemployed, including casuals, rose by 31,000, andtemporarily stopped by 33,000.   The registration of children who left school at the end of the summer term has helped to swelljuvenile unemployment, the increase in this class amounting to14,600.   Slight improvements are recorded in hotel and boarding-house and dock and harbour services, and in marine engineering.     Overseas Trade,   There was an exceBs of imports overexports of merchandise in July of  19.3 million, or  11.6 million less than the corresponding figure for July, 1931.     Exports of United Kingdom manufactured goods in July werevalued at  424,000 less than in the previous month and  4.1 million less than in July, 1931.     Rail and Road Transport.   Railway traffic receipts for theperiod of six weeks ended August 13th, showed a decline of 9,6%compared with 1931.   This figure Bhows a slight improvement inthe position as compared with the month of June, when the
                                                            9 f* 0                                                              0 Upercentage decline was 10.1$.   This improvement is,  doubtless,partly due to the seasonal increase in passenger movement.   Therehas also been some increase in regard to coal and coke where adecline of 6.9% is reported as against 10.4$ for the  previousperiod.     Freight tonnage figures indicate a decline of 21.3$ for lowclass merchandise (i.e. mainly raw materials),  3,8$ for coal and coke and 12.6% for other merchandise.     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)registered for the first time in June shows a decrease of 268 or1.5% as compared with the corresponding period in 1931,  but  shows a considerable improvement over the figure for May when thecorresponding decrease was 20%*   This improvement WSB due to  anincrease  in the number of cars taxed on horse-power, theposition in regard to commercial vehicles &amp;c,  remainingpractically unchanged.     Coal-mining.   The number of persons employed in the coal-mining industry for the weeK ended 23rd July was 788,300, whichwas 19,500 less than the average for the 13 weeks ended on thatdate, and 69,900 less than the average for the corresponding13 weeks of 1931.   The output per person for the same 13 weeklyperiods of 1931 and 1932 was 4.80 tons and 4,76, respectively.Exports of coal in the seven months ended July. 1932, and 1931amounted to 23,157,000 tonB and 24,818,000 tons, respectively.     The suspension of orders from the Italian State  Railways  has-seriously affected the export trade of South Wales;  on the  Norjh-East coast there has been little enquiry for any class of coal.In Scotland the export trade remained moderately steady butprices were low.   The home demand showed little change.     Iron and Steel.   13 blast furnaces ceased operation during july on account of reduced demand during the holidays, reducingthe number of  furnaces in operation  to 56;  in 8 cases thefurnaces have been only temporarily damped down.   The output
of pig-iron was 292,600 tons as compared with 311,400 tonsin June  and 317,000 in July 1931.   The output of steelwas 430.300 tons as compared with 459,300 tons in June, and428,700 tons in July 1931.  It is stated that the demand for steel Is so low that any further depreciation in sterlingIs followed by a weakening of Continental prices on a goldbasis.  Imports of iron and steel in July amounted to only118,700 tons, the lowest figure for any month since 1923.Bxports (158,200 tons) exceeded those for June by 11,000 tons,the Increase being duo to exports to Russia.  The prospects of tho Industry, however, remain poor.     Shipping and Shipbuilding.   There is nothing of interestto report, the position continuing to be extremelyunsatisfactory.     Electrical Industry.  There has been little change inthe state of the electrical industry.     The decline In the volume of orders for heavy plantcontinues.  In the export trade the decline In the number oforders is almost unprecedented, the index figure for Julybeing 72 as compared with 94 for June and 142 for July, 1931.     As regards light apparatus, the position appears to bemore favourable.     The consumption of electricity has continued to increase and there are indications that this Improvement will continue.Por the first half of this year 6090/units were produced, ascompared with 5640^during the corresponding period in 1931and 5423^ in 1930.     Motor Industry.   There Is nothing of any Importance toreport In connection with the motor industry.  The home market-&apos;&quot;;&quot;rT&quot;
                                                        O O                                                        (CODremains -quiet.  In the-exporf trade, certain increases in freight charges have been made, principally in the dutch east Indies, where there has been an increase of 35s?,South Africa and Portuguese East Africa, 20%, and Kenya, 15^.     Wheat Situation.   In the U.S.A. the harvesting of thewinter wheat is practically completed.  The crop beingcomparatively small, there is little selling.     In Canada, conditions have varied in the differentprovinces but the crop promises to be of good quality and well up to the average in quantity.     Russia has disposed of fair quantities for August and september shipments.  Small quantities are being shipped fromArgentine and Australia and the prospects of the new crops are not quite so favourable as was expected.     Prospects for the English crop, as well as those of several of the European countries are good.     During the four weeks ended July 16, the volume of worldshipments decreased sharply, due to various causes such asthe total absence of shipments from Russia, a sharpdiminution in shipments from the -Argentine and Australia,the development of domestic crops in European importing countries, and the partial absorption of large floatingsupplies since the early part of June.     From August 1st, 1931, to tho end of June, 1932, worldshipments of wheat averaged well over 15 million bushols perweek, whereas during the past four weeks shipments haveaveraged only about 10 million bushels per week.     Cotton.v   The general position of the various sectionsof the cotton Industry is one of increasing uncertainty.     With regard to American cotton, it is expected that
                                                      n /rt rt                                                        DOowing to increased consumption, visible supplies daringthe next twelve months will diminish.     So far as Egyptian cotton is concerned, a considerable reduction in the acreage planted will necessarily mean abig reduction in tho crop and the prospect of higher prices.The position of the oversee, buyer is considered more satisfactory at the present time than has been the case fora number of years.     /-gainst these more favourable conditions, however,must be set the threat of a general strike in the weavingIndustry in Lancashire which may tend to cause buyers to wait in the hope of lower prices when the trouble is over.     Competition from Japan continues to become more intense,and it is suggested that the low prices indicate that thereis some question of policy behind the sales and that financial support must be available from sources externalto the mills themselves.     Exchange restrictions remain one of the principalsources of difficulty to the textile industries.     &quot;fool.   The higher price level reported last monthhas been well maintained, but business in tops and yarnshas naturally shown a slight falling off.  Exports ofpiece-goods during July were greater than during theprevious month but slightly less than during the month ofJuly 1931.  Trade with the Dominions and the Par East hasbeen satisfactory.  Exchange difficulties abroad stillhamper  the export trade.     I: a chine Tools.  Exports during  the month of June  showa  further decline and reached the very low figure of 172,705 as compared with  557,544 for April.  Exports toRussia  accounted  for nearly 73  of tho total.
                                                        Av 0 I     Pifficulties In obtaining credit Insurance for exportsto Bussla are nor? alleged to threaten an almost complete stoppage of new orders and the industry is faced with theprospect of a large Increase in unemployment.     It is stated that relations between Germany and SovietPussia continue to improve and that the recent German-russian trade Agreement has resulted in a continuance of the improved trade relations which were brought about by the 1931Accord.     Other Industries.   The incidence of the holidays  caused a slight decline during the latter part of July In thegeneral demand for chemicals.   Nevertheless deliveries ofmany products have not fallen bolow the corresponding periodof July 1931.  In dyestuffs foreign markets remain steady.     Trade in boots and shoes remains small, but in onedistrict forward orders are more numerous than for thecorresponding period last year.     Definite improvement is shown in the trade foredible oils, cooking fats, etc.   In the seed crushingindustry the volume of seed crushed showed a small increasein June and a heavy decline in July, which is normal for thetime of year.  The total production for the six monthsJanuary to June Is within 2$ of that for the same period of1931.     Retail Trade.   Tho money valuo of retail trr.de inJune compared with a year ago declined by 3.8^;  for theperiod February-June the corresponding decrease was 4.5&quot;*?.Information at present available suggosts that the Julyresults will be rather unsatisfactory.   The sales of theCo-operative Wholesale Society for  tho 5 weeks ended9th  July were 1.8&apos;X loss than for the corresponding periodof 1931.                             *6&quot;
     Finance.   The successful War Loan conversion and the consequent readjustment of prices has naturally dominated the markets during the past month.   Other features are the revival of the New York stock markets and a slight rise in commodity prices.   The &quot;Financial Times&quot; Weekly Index Number of wholesale prices was 99.5 for the first week in August compared with 97.9at the beginning of July.   Deposits of the Clearing Banks for july amount to  1,804 millions, an increase of nearly  40millions over those for june  the volume of money represented by these deposits is now greater than it was in July 1931.Bank advances continued to fall and in July were  16 millionsless than in June.     The sterling exchange rate is experiencing an adversetendency due possibly to the employment of funds in New Yorkfollowing the rise in security prices there, and to some foreignholders of War Loan deciding to realise their holdings.     In America it is thought that all indexes of businessactivity for July will record new low levels.   nevertheless there has been a recovery in security prices and an appreciablerise in the gold price of commodities.   The monetary positionis no longer acute.     The Banque de France completed at the end of June there patriation of the major part of her foreign exchange balance.The success of the English conversion scheme has caused asubstantial rise in the price of Rentes, and it is probable thata scheme will be put forward in the autumn for the conversionof the 5% and 6% Rentes.     In Germany there are few signs of any economic improvement.The expenditure of the State Railways for the six months ended30th June has exceeded revenue by Rm. 47,000,000.     Indian Trade.   For the month of July, 1932, the totalimports amounted to  8,415,000 and exports were  7,900,000.The adverse balance was, however, corrected by the export of

In Germany there are few signs of any economic improvement.The expenditure of the State Railways for the six months ended30th June has exceeded revenue by Rm. 47,000,000.     Indian Trade.   For the month of July, 1932, the totalimports amounted to  8,415,000 and exports were  7,900,000.The adverse balance was, however, corrected by the export of
gold which amounted to  4,545,000,  and thus enabled a  favourable balance of  2,805,000 to be registered.     The latest figures relating to the import of cotton piecegoods into India show that Japan has slightly increased her share in the market.   During the period  April - June,  1932,  Japanexported to India 128-1- million yards as against 83-g- million forthe corresponding period in 1931.   The United Kingdom figuresfor the same periods were 146^ million and 102^ million respectively.     Australian Trade.     The total imports and exports (in australian currency) for 1931-2 amounted to  56,987,000 and 84,923,000, respectively, figures  which indicated decreases onthe previous year of  11,821,000 for imports,  and  3,981,000 for exports.   Trade with the East has  increased in 1931-2 over1930-1 in the principal products except frozen meat.   Por  thecurrent season to the end of July wheat exports decreased by nearly 9,800,000 bushels compared with the corresponding periodof last year;  exports of flour in  the same periods increasedby 65,700 tons.   The output of butter is declining except  inSouth Australia where it is expanding,  and increasing  supplies are being shipped to the United Kingdom.     Canadian Trade.   Business conditions in Canada declinedsomewhat during the month of June.    This was largely  due to amarked decline in the iron and steel industry.   The output of pig iron was 8,163 tons in June, as compared with 13,339 tons inMay, while the production of steel  ingots and castings declined to 13,118 tons in June, as compared with 29,239 tons in thepreceding month.     South American Trade.   With the exception of Venezuela andBritish Guiana, the South American  countries remain in serious financial and political difficulties.                              -8-
     In Argentina,  the problem of exchange control  is  causinggreat difficulty.   It is estimated that,  to  cover  the minimum requirements of the Government and others  between now  and theend of the year, there will be a shortage  of  export bills of between 3 and 5 millions sterling.     Por the first six months of this year Argentina foreign trade figures, exclusive of bullion, show a favourable trade balance of 155 million gold dollars, as compared with42 million for 1931.     The situation in Brazil is very disquieting.  TheGovernment has authorised an expenditure over the next twelve years of 480,000 contos on cruisers, destroyers, &amp;c,  and hasalready spent 896,000 contos on burning coffee.   There  is  a grave danger that,  if the situation does not  improve in  thenear future, inflation may throw the country bad: again  into.ruih.
