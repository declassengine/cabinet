THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION.BROADCASTING HOUSE,         LONDON3W.1.  28th July, 1932.Colo Sir Maurice Hankey, 6.C.3.,  G.C.M.G.,     Secretary to the Cabinet,          2, Whitehall Gardens,               S.W.1.Sir,          On the evening of Wednesday, 6th July, theCorporation was informed by the Postmaster-general that the Cabinet had that morning discussed a broad-cast talk scheduled for the following Saturday night,and that it had been unanimously decided that thetalk should not be given.          Almost simultaneously General Seely announcedhimself&apos; as the bearer of a message from the Cabinet.He demanded of the Corporation an undertaking that thetalk would not be given.   Failing this, he intimated that he would present himself at Buckingham Palace next day, and request an audience of His Majesty the Kingwith a view to the cancellation of the Royal visit toBroadcasting House that afternoon.   On such conduct the Corporation feels comment is unnecessary.          If the Cabinet had been informed about thetalk - that it was one of a series, that its predecessors-cessor had been by Admiral Gordon Campbell on huntingU-Boats, that it v/as planned as a definite contribution towards the elimination of submarine warfare aspractised in the Great War, and that nothing in it wouldhave offended British listeners - the Corporation be-lieyes that the decision would have been different.          The Corporation respectfully hut seriouslyprotests against the position in v/hich it was thusplaced.   According to the Postmaster-General a de- icision had immediately to be made as to whether theCabinet&apos;s expression of opinion should be acceded toor not.   The talk was withdrawn::  but this action wastaken with very great misgiving, in.view of the con-stitutional question involved, as well as on the merits of the talk itself.          The impugnment of the Corporation&apos;s consideredjudgment in the matter of a particular talk is regretted;but the real issue is a constitutional one.   TheCorporation was established by Royal Charter, and the governors appointed &quot;by the Crownc.   In the early stages of its existence one of the greatest obstacles to over-come was the impression that the Broadcasting Companyp
IllCol. Sir Maurice Hankey.             28th July,  1932.had become a Government Department.   This unfortunateidea is by no means eradicated to-day.   There havebeen accasions on which, without justification, Govern-meht suggestion or Government domination has beenalleged by critics.   The Corporation is a new and im-portant experiment in the management and control of apublic utility service.   Its progress is watched withclosest attention, not only in this country but in mostforeign countries.   Its detachment from the Governmentof the day has been a cardinal element in its inter-national prestige.           The autonomy of the Corporation has re-peatedly been  affirmed by successive Postmasters-General in Parliament.   That a detail of its work should have been discussed and the matter settledwithout any attempt to ascertain the views of theCorporation would have been incredible had it nothappened.           According to the Licence which accompaniesthe Royal Charter, the Postmaster-General is givenplenary powers, but the Corporation was informed bythe Postmaster-General of the day (1927) that they wouldnot be exercised except in time of national emergency;nor hi therto have they ever been used.   Although on some occasions pressure from a Government department had to be resisted in the interests of impartiality,the Corporation has spared no pains in its endeavours to co-operate with Government  Departments, both intheir routine work and on special occasions.           In the interests of this great public service for which it is responsible the Corporation feels thatan incident so contrary to the spirit and intention ofthe Royal Charter should not pass without protest.The Governors venture to assume that it will not forma precedent.                  Yours faithfully,         for THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION,                       (Signed) J. II. &quot;WHITLEY.                                    Chairman.MEC.
11?A i A/          CABINET   42 (52).Extract from Conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinet  held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.I., on Wednesday,            July  6th, 1932, at 11.0 a.m.1.   THE MINISTER OP LABOUR drew the attentionof the Cabinet as a matter of urgency to thefollowing question by Commander Marsden, M.P.,which, by request, had been deferred until Thursday,7th July :-         &quot;To ash the Minister of Labour, if he          will refuse to grant a permit to Captain          Ernst Hashagen to land in this Country          for the purpose of broadcasting his          experiences of sinking British and allied          merchant shipping during the last war          while in command of a German U-boat&quot;.     In May last the Ministry of Labour hadreceived an application for the grant of a permit to Captain Hashagen, and, as the Ministry had nopov/er to refuse a permit except on employmentgrounds, which were not applicable to the case, thepermit v/as granted as a matter of course.   Theproposal that Captain Hashagen should broadcasthis experiences had aroused very strong feelings,and it would be a very great mistake if the broadcast was allowed to take place on Friday next,July 8th, as was at present contemplated.   ThePostmaster-General was empowered, on giving twenty-four hours&apos; notice in writing, to prohibit the giving of a particular broadcast;   but this powerhad never, in fact, been exercised.     General agreement was expressed with the  viewthat it would be very undesirable to have recourse                      4.
                                                    11 3                                                    i i eito the statutory powers of prohibition in this case,as this Y.ould be represented as the exercise by theGovernment of censorship powers, which should be definitely reserved for use in cases of greatnational emergency.    On the other hand, it v/as clearlymost undesirable that Captain Hashagen should beallowed to broadcast his experiences of sinkingBritish and Allied merchant shipping during thewar, while commanding a German U-boat j   not only&quot;because of the feelings of pain and resentment towhich such a broadcast must give rise among thosewho had lost relatives as a result of german submarine action, but also because we had alwaysvehemently anathematized this particular form of warfare.     The Cabinet were informed that if an intimationwas given to Sir John Eeith that in the view of theCabinet it v/as undesirable to allow Captain Hashagento broadcast, the matter would undoubtedly be disposed of without the necessity for having recourse to any statutory powers.      The Cabinet took note that the Lord President      of the Council would confer with the Post-      master General in order that the views of the      Cabinet might be communicated forthwith to      Sir John Eeith.                                                 \ )
