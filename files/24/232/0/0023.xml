COMMITTEE  ON ECONOMIC INFORMATION.              COMPOSITION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE.   ON the 1.4th July, 1981, the Prime Minister appointed a StandingCommittee of the Economic Advisory Council with the following termsof reference:       to supervise the  preparation of  periodical reports  to  the   Economic Advisory Council on the economic situation and to advise   as to the continuous study of economic development.   2.   The Committee is now constituted as follows :       Sir Josiah Stamp, G.B.E., Chairman.      Mr. W.  M. Citrine.      Mr. G. D: H. Cole.      Mr. J. M. Keynes, C.B.      Sir Alfred Lewis, K.B.E.      Sir Arthur Salter, E.C.B.      Sir Ernest Simon.            With-      Sir Frederick Leith-Boss, K.C.M.G., C.B., Chief Economic          Adviser to His. Majesty&apos;? Government.Mr. H. D.

FOURTH  REPORT.            Survey of the economic situation, May 1932.   BY  our terms  of reference we are  directed  to  supervise  thepreparation of  periodical reports  on  the economic  situation;  andin accordance with  these instructions  we* now submit the  third ofthese periodical reports.   2.   In Section I we give a brief summary of the main  changesin the  past two months, and  in  Section II we  discuss in greater detail  the  effects  of the Lausanne  Agreement  and  the  Britishconversion scheme.   Mr. Keyhes  has prepared  a paper dealing in greater detail than  we had thought convenient in our Report withthe relation of the conversion scheme to the long-term rate of interest.Without necessarily  identifying ourselves with it in every respect, wethink that the points which he raises are of such importance that we attach it to our Report  as  an appendix, although it is  understoodthat he may possibly use it in  some more public form.   8.   In Section  III we review  the international financial  crisis,and  in Section  IV the possibilities of constructive action.   Iii  that section we outline a  scheme which  we are all convinced is technicallyand  economically sound  and which requires only the support of asufficient number of important countries  to be put into  effect.   Butwe are  quite prepared   to  find initial  scepticism on the  part ofparticular  countries  which will only be overcome by the developingpsychology of an even more desperate international  situation.   4.   If, as we hope,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  feel that  thisscheme  merits  further investigation,  we  would willingly assist inany  inquiry that  may   Be instituted by elaborating the  generaloutline contained in this  report and indicating how, in our opinion,the various difficulties might most easily  be  met.                 Signed  on behalf of the Committee,                                           J. C. STAMP,                                                      Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,        July 20, 1932.   * These references do not include Mr. W. M. Citrine, who was unable, totake part in  our discussions on this Roport owing  to  his having proceeded to Ottawa in connection  with  the  Imperial Conference, or Sir frederick leith-Koss, who has no responsibility for the views expressed in our reports.

FOURTH  REPORT.   SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC  SITUATION,  JULY  1932.                    I. Recent developments.   THE  following  are  some  of  the  principal  economic  eventsoccurring since  the  preparation  of   the  Committee&apos;s  last  report(Council Paper E.A.C.  (S.C.) 3) :-   2.   The outstanding economic events of recent months, are theagreement reached at  the  Lausanne  Conference and the announee-ment by the British Government of  the scheme for the conversionof the   2,000 millions of 5 per cent.  War Loan.   The  boldnessof the enterprise represented by the  conversion scheme is evident,when it is  remembered that  the  yield on long-date government securities was rather over 4 per cent,  as late as the 16th June, andwas  about  3 17s.  Ad.  on  the  day before the announcement  of theoffer, while  the effective yield of the  new security, allowing for the bonus of 1 per cent., is about  3  10s.  9d.  The scheme, however,was  universally   acclaimed  and  elicited  an  immediate  marketresponse, all classes  of  Government securities  rising sharply  to prices representing yields in the  neighbourhood of that  on the newsecurity, and the upward  movement   extending to Stock Exchangesecurities  in  general,  including ordinary  shares  and  foreign government  bonds.   3.   This  result  is the more striking in view of the fact that the previously   existing  prices  of  British  Government   securitiesrepresented a substantial improvement in British Government  credit,during the present year, unaccompanied by any  similar improvementin the  credit of  foreign governments.  The  following table  shows the  respective  prices of the 3 per cent, securities  of the British,French  and  Dutch Governments at different  dates during  the pasttwelve months :                             TABLE 1.

The launching of the conversion  scheme on  the  80th june was preceded by the reduction of Bank rate  to 2  per  cent, on&quot; theprevious  day.   The  short-term rates of interest  had already fallen to levels  only equalled in 1894 and  1895.  In  spite  of the  attractionsof non-assented  War Loan as a short-term investment new Treasuryhills (which were issued  at an average rate of 15s. 0-19d. per cent.a fortnight  ago)  were issued this week at  an average  rate  of  only17s. 2-88d. per cent.   The values  of  all classes of  shares haveimproved as a  result of the conversion scheme.   Industrial shareswhich  had been  stable  throughout  June  at levels  rather above thelow point reached at the  end  of May rose sharply, the FinancialNetvs share index rising from  51-2 at the end of May  to 54-0  atthe end of June, and to 60-7 on the 8th July.   On the other hand the sterling exchange fell.   Though the conversion offer contributedtowards this, there were other  influences  at work.  During the first half of June this fluctuated between 8-66 and 8-70.  On the cessation-
tion of the drain on New  York mentioned subsequently,  it fell  to between 8-60  and 8-62.   Recently there has  been a  further fallas low as 8-54.    5.   Employment  in  Great Britain  has  continued  to decline,falling from  9,484,000  in April to 9,402,000 in May, and again  to,894,000  in June.   At-the end  of that month the total figure  ofunemployment  was 2,770,000.   The  position,  moreover,  is  more serious than this aggregate.   For while  there  has been  a markeddecrease in unemployment among  women in the  last  ten months(due, in part,  to the effects  of the  means test),  there  has been aserious and  progressive  increase  in  unemployment  among   men.Between March and June there occurred in coal mining an increasein unemployment much heavier than is  usual at this time of  year.There  has been some seasonal improvement in  building and  publicworks  contracting, in distributing,  and in other  services, but not  somuch  as is normal.    6.  There are other  indications of  a slackening of  industrial activity.  For  example,  the  receipts  of the railways  from  goodstraffic  showed the following declines as compared with  1981 :                                                 Per cent.           1st  to  8th weeks.........     - 7-5           9th to 16th weeks......     ...     - 8-3          17th to 24th weeks.........     -11-2Similarly  the index of  the consumption of electricity published bythe Economist, which is corrected for seasonal variation  and normalincrease, fell sharply in  May  to the  level of last  September,  after having ruled at a substantially higher level  from October to  April.    7.  The foreign trade  returns for June continue to show a smalleradverse balance of trade  than  has  been usual in recent years.   Forthe last five  years, the  adverse balance  of trade for the first  half-year has been as follows :                                                    million.1928  .........    ......      1831929  ...............      1851930  ...............      1881981  ................      1831982  .:.............      144   8.  The improvement  of   39  millions as  compared with  1931is the result  of  a decrease of  58 millions  in  imports  (of  which 48   millions   was  in  manufactured  goods,   particularly  textiles,apparel and manufactures  of metal) partially offset by a decrease of 19  millions in exports and re-exports.   9.  The fall in commodity  prices has continued.   During the  six weeks from  the   4th  May to  the  29th  June,  British prices,  as measured by the  Economist index number, have fallen by 5-7 percent.   Prices have also fallen in France and the  United States, butin a lesser degree.  In recent weeks prices in the United States have risen  somewhat.TABLE 2.Wholesale commodity prices.

                                n   10.  The drain of gold from New York  during May and thefirst  half  of June reached  enormous  proportions.   ,In  the  middleof June this movement came to an abrupt end, partly beckuse  foreigndeposits in  New  York had  been reduced to the lowest convenientpoint, partly because domestic  confidence was restored by the  passingof the Tax Bill; and the  rejection of the Soldiers&apos; Bdnus Bill.  TheFederal Beserve  Banks  continued  their  purchases  of  government securities  throughout the period, but  only  on a scale  sufficient tomaintain the surplus reserves  of the member banks  at a figure thatwas substantially  unchanged.  The  principal changes in  the  balance sheet of the Federal Beserve  Banks since the  7th  April (when thevigorous open market  policy was initiated)  and the  14th July were as follows :                            TABLE 3.

At the beginning of  June the formation of a pool to under-take the  purchase of bonds  was announced.   Its capital was  fixed at $100 million, and was  subscribed by a number  of banks.   Theanticipation of its operations caused a rise  in the  price of bonds.This  was  not  wholly maintained  when  it  became clear  that  nodramatic  intervention in the market was intended.   12.  The prices of American stocks have  been in the neighbour-hood  of the low point reached at the  end of May, and have show no  strength.  Commodity  prices have recovered  slightly from thelow point  reached  in  the .middle of June, and  the general tendency to rise has been  maintained in recent  weeks.  In the middle ofJune  there  were  some  indications  of increased  business  activity.More recently, however,  there seems to have been a further fall.   13.  Production in France is at present  at  a very low level, theindex compiled by the  Statistique generale showing a  decline of84  per cent,  in April in comparison  with  the high point  reached in 1980.   This evidence of a decline in  production  is borne out bythe reduction recorded in employment up to the end of April.  InMay, on the other hand, there was a slight increase in employment and  figures for  unemployment  show  a  decrease  throughout June.Movements  in the French unemployment figures are unreliable asan indication  of changes in  the level of business activity,  as they take no account of the  repatriation of foreign workers,  which hasrecently been taking place on &amp; very considerable scale.  But makingallowance  for  this, there is no longer  the rapid deterioration in theFrench economic position  that  was noticeable in the  first quarterof this year.   14.  One of the main factors in the decline in French production has been the fall in both  the value and volume of exports.  Comparedwith  1929 the volume of exports  in the  first  quarter of 1982 wassmaller  by  nearly  40 per cent.,  while  their  value has fallen by
56  per  cent.  The decline in values for the two months April andMay  compared with 1929 was 62 per cent.    15.   French imports have, since the autumn of last year, beensystematically  reduced by  a  system  of  quotas.   The volume  ofimports in the first quarter of 1982 is  24  per cent, less than in thesecond  quarter  of 1981, in  which  quarter  imports reached theirpeak.   The  severity  of the quota  restrictions  has, however, beenrelaxed lately in the case of certain important commodities, and thereare signs that the process may be carried further.    16.   Wholesale prices in  France showed a tendency  to rise  in,the  first  three  months of  this  year,  partly  as  a  result of  therestriction of imports, and partly in view of a more hopeful  senti-ment.  Since March, however, there has been  a  further fall, prices at the end of June being at  their lowest point  since stabilisation.    17.   Though  the  Bank  of France&apos;s  gold holdings  continue  toincrease,  this increase is  at present  more  than balanced by  the decrease in its holdings of foi-eign  exchange.  Since the  beginningof May the  total  of  gold and foreign exchange  has been  reducedby  more  than  a  milliard francs.    18.   The volume  of  world trade  continues  to decline.   Thefollowing  table  gives particulars  for  the  four  principal  tradingnations :                             TABLE 4.Comparison of the trade  of  the four principal trading nations  for             the  first five months of 1982 and 1931.

Although the French visible balance of trade has improvedrelatively to 1981, this improvement was confined to the first quarterof the year.   In  April and May the  adverse balance was nearly thesame as last year.  The  German visible balance  of trade has  been favourable for the first five months of this year to the extent ofR.M. 465 millions, in addition to which there have been reparation deliveries  amounting  to  R.M.  52  millions.  This  represents  afavourable visible  balance  at  the  rate  of R.M.  1,200 millions per year.  Together  with her credit balance  on  invisible account,this is about sufficient to  meet the interest and amortisation  charge on  the  external debts.  But the present favourable visible  balance is based on a reduction of imports to a monthly level of  R.M. 400millions, as compared with over R.M. 1,000 millions in  1929, whichhas, probably entailed drawing on internal stocks of raw materials.   * The pound is taken at its average value for 1932, namely, 3&quot;60 dollars.
    20.  In South  America there has  been a widespread  outbreakof political disorders,  including  revolutions, civil conflicts and  therupture of  diplomatic relations  between neighbouring  States.  Insome countries decrees have been passed forbidding the acceptanceof deposits  expressed in terms of foreign currencies.  In  Argentinathere is a  serious shortage of  foreign exchange,  despite a  much improved trade balance.    21.  The  Japanese exchange has  shown  continuous  weaknessbeing at present  quoted at Is. 6$d.  This  is leading to complaintsin  the  Indian market.   The exchange deterioration  is  probably due to the  continued unfavourable&apos; balance of trade.   The figures forthe first five months of this year  and last year are as follows:-                             TABLE 5.   Javanese foreign trade for first five months,  1981 and  1932.                       (In millions of yen.)                                      1932.        1931.

The weakening of the exchange  may havebeen due in part  to the accumulation of sterling for  this purpose.            II. Lausanne and the  Conversion scheme.   22.  The agreement  at Lausanne is  the most hopeful develop-nient which has  occurred  since the  depression began.   The systemof large-scale  Reparations has been one of the  main  elements  of&apos;fundamental instability in the post-war economic system, and hasthus contributed  in a very large degree  both  to the occurrence  ofthe world  economic  depression  and to the international  financialcrisis which has  followed  from  it.  As long  as the  Reparationsproblem remained  unsolved,  it  served to  block the  road to anyconstructive international  policy, and  threatened to  aggravate  thesituation further  at any time by provoking a default which  mighthave  had  far-reaching consequences, both  financial  and  political.Assuming that the Lausanne  Agreement  is accepted by the peoplesconcerned,  and is  made effective by an amicable writing down  ofother war   debt  claims,  it is fair  to  say that an indispensablepreliminary step  to world recovery has  now been  taken.   23.  The  agreement   has  had  a   marked   effect  in  raising the prices  not merely of  German bonds, but  of Central  Europeanbonds  generally.   This implies  a  strengthening  of  international confidence  which, as  we shall later  argue,  is an  essential conditionof world improvement.  It may  prove,  however,  that the beneficialreactions of the  agreement taken by  itself will be  comparativelylimited.  Germany has not been paying Reparations  for some time past,  and  no  one has  supposed  that she  was likely to  be  calledupon to pay  them for a  long time to come.   Other factors thanReparations enter  into  the  distrust  of the  financial position  ofGermany and  Central Europe, however much Reparations may beresponsible in  the last analysis.   These  factors are not only financialbut also, in part, political, including the growing internal politicalinstability  of  Germany and the  many  sources  of friction  in  inter-national affairs.   It seems unlikely, therefore,  that  the  Lausanneagreement  will suffice  to  remove this  distrust.   Por this purposeconstructive  policies   of   international   co-operation  are   probablyessential.   The main  significance of  the Lausanne agreement  is thatit clears the way  for them. We  deal with the opportunities that  are thus opened up in a  later section of our report.    24.  In a  different sphere, the  British  conversion scheme may also  exert important  repercussions  on  the   general   economicsituation.    As we  have already pointed out, it is only in  GreatBritain  that the  trend of yields  on  Government securities has beendownwards  in the past twelve months.   In countries with positions
 as strong as those of France and Holland, the prices of Government securities  have  been  falling.   Thus the  general  world  tendency has been that at a time when the power  of capital to earn a return has been steadily declining, lenders, apprehensive of the  security of even the most gilt-edged  investments have been reluctant to lend unless  compensated against risk by higher interest rates.    25.   Before  world  trade can  recover it  is  essential that this tendency should  first  be  reversed,  and  the  British   Conversion scheme, if it  achieves a marked  success,  may prove  a  decisive  factor in reversing  it.   If  the credit  of  the British Government can be established  securely on a basis of not much more than S-J- per  cent., it seems not  unlikely  that  investors in  other countries  will take  a more favourable view  of  the securities of their  own  Governments, and that less money will  accordingly be  hoarded or kept in a very liquid form.   In  this way the conversion  scheme, if it  succeeds, may give  an impetus  towards  lower  interest  rates not merely  in  Great Britain but in the world generally.    26.   From the national standpoint it  is obvious that a successful conversion scheme will be of great  value both in directly relieving the budgetary position  and in confirming confidence in the capacity of Great Britain  to surmount her economic difficulties.    27.   The immediate response of the Stock markets and of public opinion to the announcement of  the conversion scheme has been all that could be desired.  None the less, it would be premature as yet to attempt to  judge  whether  the  scheme  will  be successful.   The essential criterion  of success in  our judgment is  not  the  degree to which holdings of 5 per cent. War Loan are converted.  There would be nothing to regret in a response which left a moderate  percentage of the War Loan unconverted. This would, indeed, in our judgment he preferable  in  some  ways to a complete  conversion.  In view of the  prospect  of   conversion and  the limits  that  existed  to the possibility  of  capital depreciation,  War   Loan had for  some  time past  assumed  the character, in the eyes of financial institutions, of a  semi-short-term security.   The investment needs of some of the present holders of  War  Loan might,  therefore,  be best met by a  new  short-dated security which could be issued  at  a low rate of interest.  On the other  hand, it is important that  the new War  Loan should not fall to a substantial discount when the process of conver- sion is  complete.   There is, we  think, a certain  danger  that  some of the  financial  institutions which  have  been persuaded  on public- grounds to convert holdings  of War  Loan which  they  have hitherto regarded as a  semi-short security, may endeavour to sell part of the new 3? per cent.  Loan at  an early date, thus  tending  to depress its price.  The success of the  conversion,  from  the  standpoint of its bearing upon British Government credit  and  long-term rates of interest  generally, cannot be  said  to be assured  until  the extent of this danger can be gauged in the  light  of experience.    28.   The  foreign exchanges  represent another  possible source of.danger to the  success of the conversion scheme.  The  announce- ment of the scheme has been followed by  a general rise in the prices of British securities of  a  gilt-edged character to figures  at which they give low  yields as compared with those which can be  obtained on  comparable  foreign  securities.   Foreign  holders  of  British securities may be tempted in these circumstances to sell  them and to invest the proceeds in their own  countries,  and their disposition to do so will be  increased in so  far as the idea  gains ground that the British conversion scheme marks a turning-point  towards a lower level of  interest rates in the  world.  A movement  of  this kind would throw some strain upon  the  sterling exchanges,  and this strain might be greatly  increased  if British  investors were  to  decide  on any  considerable  scale  that  the  present  was  a favourable time tosell some of their  British securities and  invest,  say,  in  American fixed interest securities.  It  is important   to appreciate that in thisconnection,  as in  so \ many others, we  have  to reckon  with  the cumulative nature  of economic tendencies.   A slight weakening of sterling  arising from the causes  mentioned,  by altering  prevailingideas  as to  the future course of sterling, might  stimulate  a much larger movement.    [7295]                                                 c
   29.  For these reasons it will be some months before the successof the conversion scheme in the widest sense can be regarded asdefinitely  established.   In the meantime,  the response which it has so far secured is an encouraging  factor.   The development of theinternational  situation  is  likely to remain,  however,  the decisivefactor  in  determining  the  course  of  British trade;  and  we  turn,therefore, to examine  this situation at some length.              III. The International  Financial Crisis.   30.  It  is generally  recognised  that  an  acute international financial crisis has been the dominating  feature of the developmentof the  world depression in  the  past year.  It may  be  doubted,however,  whether  the full  significance and  implication  of  thisphenomenon are generally appreciated.   81.  The financial crisis is international, not merely in scope butin character.   Its  essential  aspect, that is to  say, is not the factthat something in  the  nature  of  an international financial crisis,or at  least a  widespread condition of  financial  apprehensiveness,exists in every country at  the present time.  The vital point is thatthe crisis  is primarily one of international financial relations.   the soundness, not so much of financial concerns, but of whole  countries,has  aroused distrust.   There has  followed  a  &quot;run&quot;  upon  thosecountries  by  the outside  world,  which  has driven  them  in  effectto close their doors.  Distrust  has then spread to other  countries,  -believed to  be heavily  involved  in  their failure.   The &quot;run&quot; hasbeen  transferred to them until they  too  have been forced to do something analogous  to  closing  their doors.   This has  been  thecentral theme of the financial story of the past  twelve  months an  international  financial crisis,   analogous  to  the old-fashionedfinancial  crisis  in   the  successive  waves of distrust  which it hasentailed,  but  with  the  distrust directed against the whole  economy of countries rather  than the  solvency of financial  institutions.   32.  An  international financial  crisis  of  this  character is an-essentially new phenomenon.   It has  happened, of course, in pastdepressions that countries, such  as those of  South  America, have got into financial difficulties,  that their Governments have defaultedon their external loans, that  their currencies have  depreciated, thattheir troubles have had widespread repercussions in depressing  world trade as a whole, and  in losses  to  investors in countries like  GreatBritain.   But, in the first place, these losses were mainly  a matterof the depreciation of  long-term investments;  there  was compara-tively  little international  short-term  money to be lost  or frozen.Secondly,  the repercussions never  entailed a serious &apos;&apos; run &apos;&apos;  upon any important financial centre, or any distrust of its. soundness.  the parallel in  the internal  sphere to previous international  financialtroubles would be  the  bankruptcy  of a  number  of industrial  firmsof some  but not  outstanding importance,  entailing  the  loss byinvestors  of the  capital subscribed and some loss  to  the banks,  but no real shock to the stability of the financial structure.  In the pasttwelve months, on  the other hand, we have witnessed a phenomenonanalogous to  the failure of some important banks.    83.  In the  light  of our present experience,   it  seems  possiblethat the  stability of the pre-war international  financial  system was really  more precarious than was  ever realised, and it  is  perhapssurprising,  in view of the  many serious disturbances that  havemarked the course of international politics,  that  no crisis of  thepresent character should have occurred before.  It  is worth recallingthat the  central theme of Bagehofs  Lombard Street,  that classicdescription of the London money market, was the latent danger of a run upon  London,  and  the inadequacy of the then Bank Beserve as a safe guard against this danger.  After pointing out that as a sequel tothe  Franco-German war &quot;London  has  become  the  sole  greatsettling-house of exchange transactions in Europe, instead of  beingformerly  one of  two,&quot; and  that  foreign deposits in  London had greatly increased,  Bagehot continues  as  follows :        &quot; And this  foreign deposit is evidently  of  a  delicate and    peculiar nature.  It depends on the  good opinion of foreigners,
   and that opinion may diminish or may cnange into a bad opinion.   After the panic of 1866, especially  after the  suspension of Peel&apos;s   Act (which  many  foreigners confound with a suspension  of cash   payments),  a large amount  of  foreign  money  was  withdrawn   from   London.   And  we  may  reasonably presume  that   in   proportion as we augment the deposits of cash by foreigners  in   London,  we augment both the chances  and the disasters of a   &apos; run &apos; upon England.       &quot; x\nd if that run should happen, the bullion to meet  it must   be  taken from the Bank.....       &quot; In  consequence, all our  credit system depends on the Bank   of  England for its security.   On the wisdom of the  directors  of   that one  joint-stock company, it depends whether England shall   be  solvent  or insolvent.&quot;.The  italics  are Bagehofs  own, and they  form one  of the rareexamples  of  the use of italics in the book.  They may be taken  asan  indication  of the  genuine  apprehensiveness   of  one  of  theshrewdest judges of financial affairs,  that  what happened in 1931might  have  happened even sixty years ago.   34.  In  fact, however,  the City of  London passed safely throug hall the vicissitudes of the pre-war period, and each fresh w-orld crisisappeared  to  demonstrate  the  strength  of  her  position.   Theculminating  demonstration was  supplied  on the  outbreak  of theGreat  War, when  despite  the fact  that  Great  Britain  was  abelligerent,  all the foreign exchanges moved strongly in her favour,owing  to the fact that London&apos;s short-term claims greatly exceededher short-term  obligations.  Nor was it merely that London succeeded in difficult  times in  maintaining her  own solvency.  She used  toassist in  maintaining solvency elsewhere by large shipments of gold to centres of financial crisis, drawing gold in her turn from centreswhich  were  not affected.  The familiar descriptions of London  as.the world&apos;s  banker indicate, that  is to say, a real and importantfunction  which,  until the present  crisis, London  never failed  to-discharge.   85.  It is of the essence of  the present world difficulties that it-became impossible  for  London  to  continue  to  discharge that vitalfunction,  and  that no  other  centre has been  willing  and  able  todischarge  it.   The  developments of the post-war period  had addednew  elements of danger,  largely unperceived until  the crisis arose,to the stability of the  international financial structure.  The large-scale  of  Germany&apos;s  borrowings  from  abroad  since 1926,  and  inparticular the large extent to which those borrowings took a short-term  form,  made  natural a  &quot;run&quot; upon Germany,  when the severity  of  the world  depression  had  become pronounced.   the resulting  failure of Germany  to meet her  immediate  obligationsmeant the failure of a country far more important economically than had ever failed  before, and entailed inevitable embarrassment in everyfinancial  centre.  In  the  circumstances  it was  only to be expectedthat  there should be demands on  London,  as  the  world&apos;s banker;.but,  owing   to  other  post-war  developments,  the  demand  whichLondon was liable to meet had become enormous.  Largely  as thesequel  to the flight  of capital from  many European countries duringthe post-war inflation period,  many  banks  on  the  Continent  hadaccumulated large  balances  in London,  which  they  had  been persuaded to leave  there  in  the  name of  international co-operation for  the more economical use of gold.  The &quot;deposits  of  cash  byforeigners in London&apos;&apos; had thus been  &apos;&apos; augmented &quot;  to a larger-order of magnitude  than had sufficed to arouse the  apprehensions  ofBagehot.  With other factors to accentuate distrust of the soundnessof the  British position, a &quot;run&quot; was directed  upon London which she was unable to sustain.   36.  From  a purely national standpoint, the enforced  departure of Great  Britain from the  gold standard has had many advantages.It has  given a  much needed relief to our exporting industries whosecompetitive  position  in  world markets was becoming desperate.   Ithas served to maintain our local economic system for some  months from  further  deterioration  despite the  deepening  of   the  worlddepression.   It has conferred similar advantages  upon other countries     [7295]                                              o 2
which  have linked their currencies with sterling.  But  it has  also increased the consciousness of the instability of international financial relations.    The   psychological   effect  in   the  outside  world  ofthe  fall  of  sterling  was  profound.   No  one  has  been   ableto feel quite  confident since it happened of  the  security  of  anycurrency in the world;  and this general lack of confidence serves torender  precarious  even   currencies  like   the  dollar  which  areimpregnable  against a purely external drain.   This  makes  itimpossible  for the  United  States,   and perhaps  for  any  singlecountry to step into the breach  and  to discharge the functions  of a world  banker  by  advancing money to embarrassed  countries.   87.  There thus exists   to-day   a  condition  of  international financial distrust  which  reacts upon international trade in essentially the same way as an internal  financial  crisis  reacts upon  internaltrade.   Every  country  is  in  the position that either there has beena run  upon it which it has  failed to sustain or that  there  may atany  moment come a run  upon  it  including  a flight  from it by itsown  citizens.   There  may   be waves  of  renewed  confidence inparticular currencies, as there has been in sterling in recent months,but no reliance can be placed in such changes of sentiment.  To each country, therefore, a favourable balance of payments appears a vital necessity,  just as  a liquid  position  is essential to  each financialconcern in an internal  crisis.   If it has not got a favourable  balanceit must seek to create one; if it already has  one it feels bound to do all it can to preserve it  and to strengthen it.   In these circumstancesevery country is  reluctant to  buy more  than it  can help from othercountries, or to lend to  them more than it can help; and  the importprohibitions, quota schemes and the restrictions on exchange dealingswhich  are helping  to  cripple  international  trade  are the  naturalconsequence.   Huskisson  declared with  reference  to the financialpanic of 1825  that  the country was  within twenty-four hours of astate of barter.  The reduction  of international  trade to a  state ofbarter  is  equally inherent  in  a  breakdown  of the international financial system.            IY. The Possibilities of constructive action.   38.  In the light of the  above analysis,  we regard a revival ofconfidence  in  international financial  relations  as  the  fundamentalcondition of world recovery.   Failing a  growth of confidence in thissphere, we doubt if it will be possible  to avoid a further deterioration in the  position of international trade,  and it is probably idle  to hopethat  any particular country can secure a material improvement in itsdomestic economic life so long as the international position continuesto degenerate. For this reason, we attach  great importance to the lausanne agreement, and  to the possibilities of further action whichit opens out.   39.  There may be  a  better  prospect now or in the near future,than there has been hitherto, that deliberate efforts  to bring abouta recovery  may be aided rather than thwarted by the normal develop-ment of the credit cycle  itself.  In  the  earlier phases of a  cyclicaldepression, opinion is only too  ready  to expect the  downward move-ment to be reversed in due course by the unaided operation of naturalforces; whereas after the  depression has continued for some time, all hope of such  a reversal rapidly ebbs  away.   A point has now beenreached, in our  opinion,  when  it  may  be  necessary to remind theworld that a part of our economic troubles is due to the operation ofthe same kind of forces as have brought about slumps in the past.For  to the extent that  this is the case,  the  mere lapse of time  will,for a variety of reasons, tend to bring a remedy. The depression onthis  occasion is,  indeed, so violent and prolonged and its causes socomplex and  powerful  that there  may  be  good  reason  to fear lest the economic  and financial system may lose its resiliency before the turn comes; and it would, therefore, be most imprudent to  rely onnatural forces  or  to relax  our deliberate efforts at appeasement andstimulus.   But this should not  lead  us  to overlook the fact that apoint will  come,  and may be  near  at  hand, when the  underlyingconditions  will begin to work with,  rather  than against, concertedplans  for recovery.
    40.   The Lausanne  agreement has  already  had an appreciableeffect in strengthening international confidence.  It would be unwise,indeed, as we  have already indicated, to build  large  hopes  on thesettlement of Reparations taken by itself.  The conference, however,also passed a  resolution setting up  a  committee  to  consider themeasures required for the restoration of the countries of central and eastern Europe and a resolution inviting,the League  of Nations toconvoke a world conference on monetary- and economic problems.    41.   A scheme by which the stronger countries would co-operate.in  the  reconstruction  of the embarrassed  countries of central  andsouth-eastern  Europe would contribute  greatly  to  the restorationof international financial confidence,  and so  to the re-establishmentof normal trading conditions.  In the meantime, the announcement that such a  scheme  is  even being contemplated should  exercise a useful  steadying influence.   There are,  however, obvious difficultiesin the way  of  providing international assistance by  means of loans to debtor countries.  For it  is highly probable, in view of the presentposition of the debtor countries, that any  loans made to them will represent a case of throwing good money after bad,  while  on theother hand creditor countries are likely in present circumstances tobe reluctant to endanger the liquidity of their international position by  making loans on any  substantial scale  which will probably befrozen assets.  Nor, indeed, would the support of particular  groups of debtor countries  prove an adequate remedy to the disorganisation of trade which  affects the whole world.    42.   To  overcome  these  wider difficulties, it may be important,therefore, to have  recourse to  constructive  international action inthe monetary sphere.  A clue to the type of action which might be effective may be found by pursuing further the  analogy of the  old-fashioned internal financial crisis. In London, during the nineteenth century,  a  technique for  allaying incipient financial panics  wasevolved, as the result of the teachings of experience.  The cardinalprinciples of this  technique were two-fold :-     (i) That, at a time of crisis, the Bank of England should lend,          not less  freely, but  more  freely, to  all  borrowers  who          could offer security that was normally sound.    (ii) In order  to make  the   above  possible,  that  the  Bank of          England  should be authorised, in case of need to issue          additional notes.   43.  Both the  above principles were  invoked in  the solution ofevery serious financial nanie in the  last century.  At the  time ofpanic of  1825, which was  perhaps  the  most  serious of all,  the note-issue of  the  Bank of  England  was  not yet subject to  anyquantitative limitation;  but  it had been the practice  of  the Bankuntil that time to issue notes only against the security  of ExchequerBills.   &quot; We  found,&quot;  wrote  Sir  Robert  Peel to  the Duke ofWellington,  &quot; that the Bank had the power  to lend money on  depositof goods.....We  advised the Bank to take the whole  affair  into their  own hands at once,  to issue their notes  on the  security ofgoods.....   They reluctantly consented,  and rescued us  froma very  embarrassing  predicament.&quot;  Having agreed to this course,the  Bank acted  with  decision.   According  to  the account ofMr.  Harman,  &quot; we lent money by  every possible means, and inmodes  which we had never adopted  before; we took  in stock on security,  we purchased Exchequer  Bills,  we made  advances  onExchequer Bills, we  not  only  discounted outright, but  we  madeadvances on deposits of  bills of  Exchange to  an  immense  amount in short,  by every possible  means consistent with the  safety of theBank.&quot;   In  this  way the  panic  which, according to Huskisson,threatened to reduce the country to  a state  of barter, was allayed.But, of  course, the Bank  could  not  have  lent with  this freedombut for its power to issue notes which were  legal tender.  Indeed.deposit-banking being  then  in its infancy,  its advances were madefor  the  most part in the  form of notes.   44.  In  1844  the Bank Act  was  passed  which   limited  thefiduciary note issue  of the  Bank.  In subsequent financial panics,however,  a temporary increase in the note  issue was made possible
by  the expedient of the  &quot;crisis  letter,&quot; i.e., a  letter from  thePrime  Minister and  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer authorising  theBank to issue notes in excess of  the legal  limits and  promisingto obtain from Parliament  the necessary  indemnity.  With  this authority behind  them, the Bank did not hesitate to lend on a scalesufficient to arrest the  panic.  As  the century wore on, the  know-ledge that the Bank  Act would be  suspended in case  of need,  andthat,  as a  consequence,  harassed  debtors  with  good security tooffer would  be able  to  obtain  advances from  the  Bank, sufficed toprevent panics from arising.   45.   The  question thus arises  whether similar principles couldbe applied in the solution of  our  present international difficulties.It would be  much easier to organise effective international assistanceto embarrassed countries,  if some means could be  found of  securingat least a temporary increase in the supply of the means of paymentavailable for the  discharge of international obligations,  which wouldalso serve as a safe  basis for internal credit expansions.   Just asa temporary increase  in the  supply of internal legal  tender is an appropriate   and essential instrument  for  allaying   an  internalfinancial panic, so,  it  may be suggested, is  a temporary  increasein the supply of international legal tender an appropriate and,  itmay prove,  an essential instrument for remedying an  international financial crisis.   The same, fundamental justification  exists in both cases.   A  supply of  internal  legal  tender,  which may  be  fully adequate  for  the needs of the public under normal  conditions ofconfidence,  may be  wholly  inadequate  when confidence  is  badlyshaken and  everyone  in endeavouring to obtain payment  of whatis due to him.  Similarly, a  world supply of monetary gold  whichmay be  fully adequate for the needs of  international trade  under normal conditions  of  confidence may be quite inadequate  under conditions of  international distrust  and disequilibrium  such as  nowprevail.    46.   An increase in the supply of international means of paymentcould be secured in  a variety of ways.  An international  agreement to remonetise silver  would,  for example, have  this  effect.  This,however, is  not  a proposal which  we favour.  The annual outputof silver is  not very  large in relation  to  that of gold,  and there  isno  reason to think that the value  of  the silver likely to  be forth-coming  from  other  sources  would be  large  enough  to  form  asubstantial addition  to  the metallic  reserves of the world&apos;s currencysystems.  Moreover,  bimetallism, if adopted  at all, would have  tobe  adopted   as  a permanent  change.   It  is  therefore  essentiallyinappropriate as a remedy for  a   temporary crisis;   and it  would do  nothing  to bring the supply  of  international means of paymentunder deliberate control.  Finally,  it  would be as difficult to  securethe  necessary international agreement  for  the  remonetisation  of silver, as for  a more constructive plan.    47.   A more hopeful line  of approach would be to develop thefunctions of the Bank for International Settlements.   It  might beagreed,  for  example, that  the  various  Central  Banks should deposita minimum percentage of their gold reserves with  the Bank for international Settlements, while agreeing to  count  these depositsas part of their reserves for reserve ratio requirements.  The bank for International Settlements would then be enabled,  on a metallicbasis,  to compensate the effects  of  any immobilisation, sterilisation,or  hoarding  of gold by  making advances to  Central Banks,  thusassisting the restoration of the international financial position.  Sucha conception  of the functions  of the  Bank for International  Settle-ments is not novel.   We understand that  it  was present in theoriginal  discussions  which preceded its  establishment.    48.  A  more powerful effect would be produced if the Bank for international Settlements  were authorised to issue  notes up to some definite  maximum  which the  various Governments  of  the world would agree  to accept as  the equivalent  of  gold.  A  great variety of  schemes  for  international  reconstruction  might be evolved onthe  basis of  this principle.   On  the  assumption  that  the  situation
may call for a  large and far-reaching  remedy, the following may beput forward  as an  example :     (a) The   Bank   for  International  Settlements   might  make          advances, at a very low rate of  interest, or possibly  free          of interest, to  the  various Governments  of  the world,          up to an aggregate sum of  say  1,000 millions gold,  this          sum  being  distributed  among them  in  accordance  with          some agreed criterion  of economic importance  (see para-          graph  50 below).   The advances could be  made  subject          to appropriate conditions, such as the removal of  restric-          tions on  exchange dealings.    (b) To enable it to do so, the Bank for  International Settlements          would  be  authorised to  issue  International Certificates,          declared  to be  the  equivalent of so many grains of  gold,          and  accepted as such  by the various Governments up  to          the amount of the advances made.    (c) If and   when the  gold   price  level  of commodities   rose          substantially,  the advances would  be gradually recalled          and  the  issue of Certificates reduced  correspondingly.   It          would  be the object of  the  Bank for International Settle-          ments, in  determining  the  proportion of the advances  to          be recalled at any time, to prevent an undue rise of prices,          without  precipitating a recurrence of depression by an          over-drastic curtailment.  If any Government was unable          to make immediate repayment  of any sum when called          upon to  do so,  the advance  of this sum might be extended          at a comparatively high rate of  interest.    49.   If a practicable scheme could be evolved on some such lines as these, there could be little doubt as to its helpfulness in breakingthrough the  present international economic difficulties.  It would put the debtor countries into a position to  meet their international obliga-tions; it would thus make possible the abandonment  of restrictionson exchange dealings, and contribute generally to  &quot;unfreeze&quot; theinternational position.  At the same  time, it would facilitate creditexpansion in the creditor countries,  and  would make it  easier fortheir Governments to increase internal purchasing power by reducingtaxation, by stimulating capital expenditure, or in other ways.   the fulfilment of these various purposes  need  not be seriously impededby the obligation  which would  rest  on the  Governments to repay the advances in the  event of a substantial rise in prices.  It is thefall of prices  that is  mainly responsible  for  the  present financial difficulties of Governments and debtor countries;  and it is reasonable to  assume  that, on  the  basis (say)   of 1928  prices,  the financialposition of Governments generally would  be  greatly improved, andthat  the majority  of debtor  countries would  be able  to  meet their obligations.    50.  The central difficulty which would be  raised by the  attemptto formulate a practicable  scheme along the above lines would be thatof  selecting a  satisfactory  criterion for the  distribution  of  the advances among the various Governments.   The  criterion of thevolume  of foreign  trade  might be objected to  by large countries  asunduly  favourable to  small  ones.  The  criterion  of  gold  reserves,which  would  from some points  of view  be the most logical and appropriate, would be open to  objection  as unduly favourable  tothose countries which had contributed to the present world difficultiesby accumulating large idle gold  reserves.   This objection might  be largely  met by  taking as the criterion not  the gold&apos;reserve which any  country actually possessed,  but  the  minimum reserve of gold or devisen  required by its laws on some given  date as the basis for the volume of currency and credit then existing. Probably the  most acceptable  criterion  would be a  complex one,  which  might include foreign  trade  and legal  gold  reserve minima  and possibly  other elements as well.  The task of securing international agreement for any  criterion would  obviously be difficult; but it is so much to theinterest of all  countries to avoid  a further intensification of the world depression  that it  should  be easier to overcome this difficulty to-daythan it would be  in ordinary times.    51.  Another  point  that would   require  careful  considerationAvould be the possibility of default on the  part  of some Government
either  in  respect  of  the  interest due  on the  advance made  to  itor in respect of the capital when called upon to repay.  Apart from some special provision, the latter would entail the consequence of thetechnical  insolvency  of  the issue  department  of  the  Bank for international Settlements; and it might mean  that a portion of theCertificates would continue  indefinitely  in  existence,  even  thoughprices  had  risen  sufficiently  to  make  desirable  their  completecancellation.   This possibility might be provided against  in  various ways, e.g., by the deposit of  bonds b,y the Governments participating in the scheme  as security for the  advances received.  Moreover,  ifa low  rate of interest were  charged on all the  advances made,  itwould  be  appropriate to  provide that  the sums  so received shouldconstitute a special guarantee fund.   The scheme would thus  assume the character of  mutual insurance.   52.  Any scheme of  the  above type would  require an alterationof the  statutes of the Bank for International Settlements,  and would raise further questions of practical detail into which we do not enterat this stage.   We are convinced, however, that the scheme whichwe have outlined is technically and economically sound, and requiresonly the  support  of  a sufficient number of  important countries  tobe put into effect.   But we  are  quite prepared  to find  initialscepticism  on the part of particular countries  which will  only be overcome  by the developing  psychology  of an  even  more desperateinternational situation.   58.  Some  of the objects which the above  scheme is designedto fulfil  might  be  secured by combining schemes  of financialassistance to embarrassed countries with concerted policies of creditexpansion on the part of the  stronger creditor countries. But thoughit might be easier to obtain agreement  for such a policy when statedin general terms, it would probably prove in practice at least  equallydifficult  to secure  the   simultaneous  adoption  of  the   measures necessary to  carry even  such a limited policy into effect  on  a scaleadequate to the needs of  the situation.   54.  We  are  of opinion,  therefore,  that the  possibility of  using the  medium of the  Bank for  International Settlements to  secure a temporary  increase in  the  international means of payment should form an important subject of discussion at  the forthcoming inter-national monetary and  economic Conference.    In  the  meantime,we  recommend  that  the  matter  should be made the subject of a systematic inquiry, in which we  should be  prepared,  if desired,  toco-operate.2. Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.

                               APPENDIX.A Note on the Conversion Scheme in relation  to the long-term rate of                                  interest.                       By Mr. J. M.  Keynes, C.B.   1.  THE successful conversion of the War Loan to a 3\ per cent, basis  isa  constructive  measure  of  the  very first  importance.   For  the  revival ofenterprise  and an escape from the slump  need,&apos; above all, a reduction of thelong-term of interest to a low  level:  and the Conversion  Scheme  represents adirect  attack  upon  this, much  more effective  in present circumstances  thanthe indirect attack of cheap short-term money, useful and necessary though thelatter is.   2.  Indeed  I would  go so  far  as  to  say  that  the effect of  the ConversionScheme on the standard of  long-term rate  of  interest,  both in Great Britainand  throughout  the world,  will be of  greater  importance than  the relief tothe burden of the National Debt, which in  its magnitude  and helpfulness maybe taken  as a  symbol of the  advantages  which  borrowers generally may begoing to obtain.  But  this will  only be the case if the effect of the ConversionScheme is not just  a  flash in  the  pan,  propped up  by  newspaper propaganda and patriotic appeal just long  enough for the Treasury to  attain its  immediateobject, but has more  or  less lasting  sequela.   This  is also important for theTreasury  itself,  since the  opportunities  for   conversion  are  by  no  meansexhausted by the present operation.  The aim should be, therefore, to maintainmarket conditions favourable to a  falling long-term  rate  of interest, not onlywhilst  the  conversion  is in progress, but also after it is over.   Early this yearI expressed the opinion that  there was no reason  why  the yield  of BritishGovernment long-term  securities should  not fall to a 3i per cent,  basis withinthe year.   There  is now no  reason why they  should  not fall  gradually  to amuch  lower basis than this,  and  every reason in  the  world why  we should wish them to do so.  But  to  achieve  this will require  the  combination ofdeliberate  purpose with the  organised co-operation  of the principal factors inthe market.  The following are notes on some of the points which may arise :     3.  It  is important that  the market should  be supplied with  securities ofdifferent types  and  maturities in  the  proportions in which it prefers them.If a particular  type,  such  as  Government stocks  having no fixed date ofredemption, are in  over-supply relatively  to stocks with  a  definite maturityeither  of early or intermediate date, as measured by the relative  strength ofthe demand  for the two types, the  former will  tend to be a weak market,which  will react unfavourably  on  long-term rates of interest generally.   Paradoxically the  risk  of   this  will  arise  if  the  Conversion  is undulysuccessful, so  to  speak, under the influence of propaganda  and patriotic appeal.For  the old War Loan has  been widely held by firms and by individuals asa temporary or  only  quasi-permanent  investment for funds which  would or might  be  needed for  other purposes perhaps  at a  definite,  perhaps at  an indefinite  date, in the belief that  it  combined  a  high  yield with  less liability to fluctuate in capital  value thau  strictly  long-dated securities.  Such holdersmay agree to  convert, but  the new War Loan  will not  suit their purposesequally well and they will incline  to  sell it when the first enthusiasm is over,unless  they have been  suited in the meantime with a security  of  a  type moreadapted to their purpose.   This object  could  be  attained  by offering holders of  assented, as well as of unassented, War Loan a  short-dated  bond at a lower  rate of interest  than3i per cent,  some time in the late autumn or  winter.  But  it means, in  anycase, that  it need not  be regarded  as a  misfortune  if a fair  proportion of theold War Loan is unconverted  and is left to be dealt with in this way  later on.  Indeed, a  short-term Bond issue would suit the  Treasury in  two ways.In the first place such bonds could, since this type of security is now in under-supply, be placed at a rate of  interest well  below    per cent.  In the second place it would ensure  a better  market for  the new  War Loan after december next, and  thus pave  the way  for  further  conversion schemes  in  due course.Indeed, it must  always be  to the  interest of the  Treasury  to  supply  theheterogeneous requirements of  the  market with securities of different types  andmaturities  in  the optimum proportions so as to  minimise the aggregate cost ofthe National Debt.   The public mind  in  relation to  the Conversion is,  as I  interpret  it,  apeculiar combination such as could only exist,  perhaps, in this country,  of akeen desire to  make  the scheme an overwhelming  success, both  by personal and  by communal action,  with an  unspoken conviction or at least a suspicion that the whole  thing  is in  truth a bit  of bluff  which a fortunate  conjunctionof circumstances  is enabling us to put over ourselves  and one another,  andthat the new  War Loan may be expected to fall  to a discount in  due course.    I am  not  sure  that the authorities  themselves  are entirely free from anidea  of this  kind.   Nevertheless I plead for a policy based on  the oppositehypothesis.  For I am convinced that the  Conversion Scheme is anything  buta bluff.  A great reduction  in the long-term interest  corresponds profoundlyto the  character and,  indeed,  to the necessities of  the underlying  facts,  andit may even  be a necessary  condition of the survival of the  existing financial structure  of  society.  Nor is  there anything in the  attendant circumstances which  need prevent our  achieving  it.  But  it  will  not happen by  itself  andmust be pursued with deliberate purpose.  For there  is  a largo  conventionalor psychological element  in the  market rate  of  interest  which needs firm  and     [7295]                                                         n
skilful muuiigcmcnt.  The first error to avoid, therefore, is the premature over-supply of a particular type of security.   4.  The  second  danger arises in quite a different way.  It iies in the verygreat disparity, which  has come into existence  since  the  Conversion SchemeWas  broached,  between  yields on  sterling securities  quoted in London  andyields  on comparable securities elsewhere, especially in the United  States.   If we had  remained  on the  gold standard,  the Conversion  Scheme  wouldprobably, in view of this, have proved impracticable in the form it has actuallytaken.  For it is the vice, as well  as the virtue, of the gold standard that itlinks the money markets of  the world rigidly together and  is  a preventativeof individual action.  The power of  one centre, even of London,  to move ahead of the rest was narrowly limited  by it,  and, if the gold  standard were  stillfunctioning,  we should  have  had  to accommodate ourselves to the  commonworld  denominator  of  intelligence,  capacity,   courage   and  public  spirit.Moreover the power of independent  action, which we  gained  when we  freedour  currency  from a common  international unit, has been  reinforced in  theactual circumstances of  the  moment by the extreme distrust  which is  felttowards  the United States to-day by most  investors and financial institutions.And  these considerations do not apply to the United  States  alone.  There  are few  quarters  of the world where,  for the time  being,  the British investor isprepared  to  venture  new funds even with the  temptation  of  a much higheryield of  interest than he can obtain at  home.   Thus to a  certain  extent the London investment market can function  asa closed system and move under local  influences  in its own orbit.   Even  so,however,  I should surmise that the existing disparity of yields cannot longpersist without  putting a great strain on, the  sterling exchange  by  stimulatinga steady trickle of funds, if not a flood,  to foreign  markets.  Since  the extentof the disparity has not  yet been realised except by the professional investor,the argument may be illustrated by a few examples :-     (i) Commonwealth of Australia sterling 5 per  cents, are  selling  in London         at about  102.   A similar  dollar 5 per  cent.  War  Loan is selling in         New York at  about  72,  and  even this price  is the result of  heavy         buying from this side.            Argentine  sterling 5 per cents, are  selling in London at about  64,         whilst dollar 6  per cents,  (of slightly  longer maturity) are at about         42  in New York.  Hungarian  (League of Nations) sterling  7i  per         cents, fetch 48, whilst the identical dollar loan stands at 28.            Indeed over  a wide field foreign bonds  to-day  are priced, for a         given  yield and security, 50 per cent, higher  in London than in New         York.  Such wide disparities have  never existed  before,  and  I do         not  believe that they  can  last.  But meanwhile the whole burden of         new borrowing, if and  when there is any, will fall on London,  whilst         apart  from new loans, there will be a  steady  stream  of buying from         London on the  New  York market.  It would  be foolish not to expect         this; and if the English buyers  are discriminating,  it may prove very         profitable.   ;(ii) The above examples  relate to  foreign Government  loans.   But much          the  same thing is true of well  secured industrial  and Public Utility         fixed  interest   securities  in  Great  Britain  and  the  United  States         respectively.   In  June  1931  the  yield on  20 high-grade American         Industrial Preferred  Stocks was  5-85  per cent.;  in  June  1932  the         yield on  the same stocks  had risen  to  8-52  per cent.   In  June 1931         the  yield on  60 representative  Bonds  (15 Municipal, 15  Industrial,         15   Uailroads  and , 15 Public   Utility  selected  hy the  New  Y&apos;ork          Exchange for  the purposes of  their index)  was 4-45  per  cent.:  in         June  1932 the  yield  on the same Bonds had  risen to 7-03 per cent.          On  reasonably  secured preferred  shares, not of  the first class, it is         easy to  find yields of 10 to 15 per cent.  And to take an  average,         the  48  preferred stocks  of  public utility  concerns  tabulated  by          Standard Statistics,  excluding those which  hod  suspended payment          and those (not a few)  which  had a yield of  more  than 30 per cent          (as  representing those which  were expected to  suspend  payment          before long), had an average vield of 12-1 per cent, at the beginning          of July.             The  yield  on the  45 Debentures  on which   the  index of  the          Institute of Actuaries  is based, which  was 5-72 per cent, a  year  ago          and 6-18 per  cent, at the end of  last year has probably fallen  to  the          neighbourhood  of 5 per cent.; while the yield on 90 preference stocks          which was 6-43 per cent,  a year ago and 6-75 at the end of  last  year          is now not much more than    per cent.*             Tt is  not to he expected that the distrust of the American  situation          and the  risk of fluctuations in the exchange will prevent  a  steady          stream of British purchases in America  to take advantage  of  these          enormous discrepancies.   (iii) Finally, &apos;there  is  tbc  relative change   here  as compared  with such          countries as France and  Holland which  can be  summed  up  in  the          following table :                                 Great  Britain.     France.     Holland.                                   3  per  cent.   8  per  cent.  3  per cent                                 Local Loans.     Rentes.      0898.)           July 1031   ......       66J          87           804;           July 1932   ......       86           7ffj          75*   * The actual figures, for a date since the conversion scheme, have not yet been worked  out  by the Institute.
   In short, the rate of interest in Great Britain is,  for the moment, altogetherout of line with what it is in the rest of the world.  I call attention to these facts,  in  order that we may  not be  taken by  surprise  when  we  begin toexperience their consequences,  but not in order that we  should  be too muchafraid of them or  of the inevitable process of relative readjustment.  For it iswe,  in  this case,  who are talking and acting sense, and  the others who aretalking  and acting nonsense; and that will tell in our  favour in the long run.We cannot  expect to function as a closed system except  within  limits set bythe  risk  of  exchange  fluctuations and  our distrust  of   financial  conditionselsewhere.  We must hope, therefore,  to infect  others by our example, and,perhaps even  to supply the first impetus to recovery by our purchases in theirmarkets.  There  is already  talk of conversion schemes in Paris  long overdueand held back hitherto by weak  concessions to politics.  It will not take muchto bring about a  reversal of sentiment in the United States.  For the momenttheir  markets are  dominated by insane gambling to get in at the  bottom, just as they  were dominated in the boom by  insane gambling to get out only atthe top.  But positions of  this  kind games  of  musical   chairs  in which allthe players but one will in the  end  fail to  get  a  seat which are not based,and  do  not  even  pretend  to be  based,  on  intrinsic  values and  long views,change suddenly.   It may be that London, supremely  sane, prudent and  bold,will  initiate the  change.  But for this we  must stick to our policy  and beprepared  if necessary,  to sit  quietly  through a period of exchange  weaknesswhich may well be calculated to make us nervous,  without seeking to  redressthe situation  by  any deflationary measures  whatever.   i5.  If the change in  the rate of interest is to be  lasting, there are manyadjustments  still  to take place.   We have  seen  that securities  of all  kinds,quoted on the. Stock Exchange, have responded with  extraordinary sensitiveness.Indeed, it would seem in some cases that they have  over-responded.  But thereare still large  areas  where the readjustment has scarcely  begun in particular the real estate market, mortgages, and house  rents.   Bank  charges and building society charges,  on the one hand, and, on  the other  hand,  the  rates  allowedon deposits  by   the  Post  Office,  the Banks, Building  Societies, municipalauthorities  and savings institutions generally are  another field where  adjust-ment  to the  new facts  lags  behind.   All  possible  readjustments  in  these directions  are, however, of  extreme  importance for  the revival of constructiveenterprise and they should  be hastened in any concerted manner which  is opento us.  In particular, it might be well  if the Banks, the Discount Houses, theBuilding Societies and the Post Office  Savings Bank would confer together  witha  view to reducing the  rates allowed  on all  new  deposits (or  re-deposits) tofigures (say)  one-third  below  the  present figures,   which would  allow corre-sponding abatements for charges on new advances.   I believe that the building societies are  already reducing the rates which they  allow&quot; on  new deposits;but  I have not heard of any reduction in their charges for new  advances.  Ifthey  were prepared  to make advances  for new house-building at 4i- per cent.,this might have  a  remarkably stimulating effect on a most desirable  type  of investment.   6.   If we agree that at  least half  the object and advantage  of a reductionin the long-term  rate of  interest is  the assistance  and stimulation  of  newenterprise, we must be extremely careful not to sacrifice the end to the means.For a  low rate   of  interest, which was only maintained by restraining newenterprise,  would  be the most futile and  disastrous  way in which  we  couldoccupy ourselves.  The market  rate  of  interest  depends much  more  on  thepsychology of the  lender and  on the  behaviour of the banking system,  thanon the volume of new enterprise; and there is no necessary reason why thecontinued maintenance of  low interest rates should not be compatible with  amarked revival of new  borrowing.    It is, therefore,  most desirable  to re-open the  new issue market  as  soonas possible;  and  also  to do such things as  to reduce the rate for new loanscharged by  the   Local  Loans  Commissioners to  Local Authorities to  a  level which corresponds  to the new  price of Local Loans Stock.    In the first instance there will probably  be a flood of  re-funding operations by concerns  which  are entitled  to pay off debentures raised  at  a higher rateof interest  than   now  prevails.   But this  will  pave the way  towards  newstandards of  interest charges all round.    One effect of  the Conversion  Scheme has been to bring  the  stock of theDominions to a  level at  which  they can again borrow   without  discredit  oroverburdening themselves.  If such loans can be floated, we shall have  taken a great step  forward towards world  recovery.  All  the same, I  hope  that we shall not return to complete laissez-faire in overseas lending; and we might do well to try some  experiments for linking  up overseas loans with  provision forsome corresponding increase in the  volume  of British exports to be purchased by the borrower.
