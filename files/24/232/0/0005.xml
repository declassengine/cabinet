India Otfick,    12th July 1932.Government of India.   There is no change in the situation.   Continued attempts to hold conferences anddemonstrations have met with little or no success.Bombay.   The situation is generally quiet  in the Mofussil, but  attempts to hold politicalconferences have been reported from  four districts.  All-India  Prisoners&apos; Day on 4th July was not, observed in most  districts.  In Ahmedabad the proposed  hartalwas unsuccessful.   A few mills closed, but there was  no general closure of shops.  InKarachi an attempt to take possession of a  building seized  under Ordinance 4 and toorganise a  procession to jail was prevented  by the arrest of the  leaders,   In Bombaycity, the response to an appeal for a hartal  was confined to cloth markets and to two-bazaars which closed on 4th and 5th,  ostensibly on account of  riots.  An attemptedmeeting  on the evening  of  the  4th  May  at Chaupatti Sands, where 50 spectatorsgathered, was foiled  by the arrest of six  persons, including three members  of theEmergency Council, and the prdgi&apos;amrrie for the 5th May was abandoned.   Picketingof Mulji  Jetha  Market  was  discontinued  from the  3rd,  as  the  foreign  clothdealers have left  the shops  there and have removed their stocks  elsewhere,  andwas  resumed  on  a small scale at the cloth shops on the  Charni Road.

Arrests of Congress organisers  continue.Promulgation  of  the new Ordinance was  generally unexpected  and  is  reported tohave had a good effect.  Karachi reports a little hardening of feeling against Govern-ment and a slight stimulus to Congress  activity, but  this  manifestation is consideredlikely to be ephemeral and due mainly to disappointment and mortification, as thewithdrawal of Ordinances and the release  of prisoners were expected.
