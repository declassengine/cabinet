Copy  No___/.......268(32)                  STATE MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS.     Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the  Secretary of                     State for Scotla,nd.          Section 16 of the Licensing Act, 1921, provides forthe  continuance, until Parliament otherwise determines, of theschemes of State Management of the Liquor tra,de establishedby the Central Control Board  (Liquor Traffic) during the War.These schemes are in operation in the Carlisle District inEngland, and in the Gfetna and Cromarty Firth Districts inScotland.   The English and Scottish schemes are worked inclose association with each other with a single Centra.1Advisory Council.          We are anxious to make adequate provision on retirement for the staff holding responsible positions in these undertakings - the majority of whom have been in the serviceof the State since the schemes were started in 1916.   A numberof them had previously been in the employment of brewerycompanies or wine and spirit merchants and. would have expected,in accordance with the practice of reputable private firms, tobe awarded pensions on retirement had they remained in privateemployment.   We have consulted the Treasury and it is agreedthat  on merits provision ought to be ma.de for the payment ofpensions to the staff concerned.   Under existing legislation the  Treasury have no power to sanction the award of pensions to officers other than established Civil Servants.   They are,however, prepared to agree in the special circumstances ofthe  present case that the provisions of the la?/ can adequatelybe met if they are assured that the State Management schemes will  not &quot;be terminated during the life of the present government.
          On the question whether the schemes should he continued, the Royal Commissions on Licensing reacheddifferent conclusions. *  The majority of the EnglishCommission expressed themselves as in favour of themaintenance of the Carlisle undertaking, (para. 417 of theirReport) only one member (the representative of the LicensedVictuallers), definitely advocating its discontinuance.The Scottish Commission recommended that, with a view to bringing the Gretna and Cromarty State Management Districtsinto line with the ordinary system of licensing, the StateManagement experiment in those Districts should bedis continued.          The investigation of this question by the ScottishRoyal Commission appears,  however, to have been of rather acursory nature and the Secretary of State for Scotland is not disposed to attach much importance to their finding on thisquestion.          The discontinuance of either the English or theScottish undertakings would require legislation.   We are noton the merits disposed to favour such legislation, but, in any event, we feel that it would be undesirable to attempt to legislate on this contentious subject in existingcircumstances.          But apart from the difficulties of legislation, weconsider that on business grounds the present would clearly ^not be the right time at which to dispose of the undertakings,even if it were desired to do so, since under presentconditions the price which could be obtained for theproperties would be greatly below their true value.          We trust therefore that our colleagues will agreethat the necessary assurance that the schemes will remainin foroe during the life&quot;of the present government may be
given to the Treasury in order that suitable provisionmay he made for the award of pensions on the scaleprescribed for established Civil Servants.                            H .S .                            A.S .28th July,  1932.
