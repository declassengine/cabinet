      In the absence of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries at Ottawa, I an charged with the responsibilityfor CaMnefc matters affecting his departments  and it is inthat capacity that I circulate the attached memorandum.I was, however, a Member of the Committee appointed by theCabinet on the 24th February last for the further consideration-tion of this question., no meeting of which has as yet beenheld.  I am satisfied that the memorandtsa expresses, though in the briefest and most susaary form, the views ofSir John Gilnour and the English department.  Wo0oGe28th July, 1932.is document is the property of His Britannic Majesty*s Government)oRET                                                      Copy $o.                       C A B I M E To  261 (32)               TBAIFLIHG IS THE MORAX FIRTH &amp; FIRTH OF CLXDE.               Memorandum oy the First Coaais sioner of Works.
          TRAfflhlflU IB THE MORAY FIRTH AND THE FIRTH OF CLDDE   lo   Hie question Immediately at Issue is whether at aconference in which hon*  Government has been invited hy theNetherlands Government to take part,  for the discussion ofsuggested amendments of the Horth Sea Fisheries Convention.,HoMs Government should ash for the inclusion in the agenda of aproposal that foreign fishermen should he required to observe the restrictions for the time being applied by HeM. Governmentto British fishermen in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde c   20   This proposal has been advanced by the Secretary ofState for Scotland, who would, I understand, have preferred tiadvance a claim to the Firths in question as national waters,,or at least to invite the other Powers concerned to enter intoa Convention defining then as being &quot;exclusive fishery limits8of the British Isles.   30   It may seem otiose to discuss the question of claimingthe Firths as national waters or as exclusive fishery limits,as neither of those proposals is, on the face of it, directlyin question.  But I oust point out that it would be extremelydifficult to argue in an international conference for the observance by foreign fishermen of regulations imposed by Roll-.Government within a given area of sea except on the groundthat Ho Mo Government was entitled to &quot;jurisdiction8 over thatareao  It seems to me, therefore, that the proposal of theSecretary of State for Scotland does, in fact, by implicationraise the very dangerous question of advancing a claim to this large open area of the sea as either national waters or asexclusive fishery  limits of the British Isles0    4.   Any such claim would  be directly contrary  to theprinciples laid down in  the report of the Inter-departmentalCommittee on the Limits  of Territorial waters, and adopted by
the Government and subsequently by the Imperial Conference of1923, and in its essence subsequently embodied in the instruc-tions of lUlu Government to its delegates to the CodificationConference which met at She Hague in March 1930-   5o   Even if this proposal did not raise the presumption ofsuch wide claims of jurisdiction over the Firths concerned., itwould entail very grave danger to the British trawl fisheryupon which we depend for some 90 per cento of our supplies offish for the home nsarfteto  If H0M0 Government advanced a claimto apply to foreign fishing vessels on the high seas regulationsenacted by themselves 3 it is practically inevitable that cor res-ponding claims should be advanced by other interested countries,and HoMa Government would, in the circumstances, have noargument that they could oppose to such claims *   6o   The fisheries from which British fishing vessels would,as a result of 3UCH counter claims, be excluded are beyondcomparison more important to this country than those of the moray Firth, notably in Icelandic and other Banish areas,   7c   The fishermen on whose behalf the Secretary of Statefor Scotland desires to establish a right to prevent trawlingin the Moray Firth are those who fish from the numerous fishingports on the shores of the Firth9 and, particularly, as Iunderstand, those who use anchored cod nets.  The cod fisheryin question is carried on for about three months only, at thebeginning of the year.  In March lasts the First Lord of theAdmiralty circulated to the members of the Sub-Committee to\which I have referred in my covering note, a report from the captain of the Fishery Protection and Mine-Sxrceping Flotillawhich clearly demonstrates that adequate protection can begiven to the cod nets by  the observance of very simple precau-tions, coupled with efficient policing.   8o   I do not attempt  to go into all the details and ramifi-cations of this very far  reaching question in the present
nenoranduEio  The questions involved are,  on the one hand,  questionsof high policy,  and,  on the other,  questions of technical  detail and of fact which,  in my opinion,  cannot  he adequately discussed in the absence of experts at a full meeting of the Cabinet0   Itwas the intention of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, who did not anticipate that this question would be discussed in  his absence at Ottawa,  to press for its reference to a Cabinet Committeeto be examined thoroughly in all its bearings.  Such  a Committeeis already in existence,  but it was the intention of  my right hon.Friend to press for the inclusion in it of the President of  theBoard of Trade,  whose department are vitally interested in all questions touching freedom of navigation  and international lawsaffecting territorial waters.   9.   I desire, therefore, to submit to my colleagues that thisquestion should be referred to the existing Committee, with  theaddition to it of the President of the Board of Trade, and that theCommittee should meet as soon as possible after the return ofMinisters from Ottawa, but in no case before all the ministers principally concerned are available0  10.   In the meantime,  I see no reason why the invitation  of theNetherlands Government to take part in the proposed conference should not be accepted, in accordance with the minute of theCabinet of the 11th February last.  The Cabinet then agreed  thatBritish participation in the proposed Conference should not  bemade conditional on the acceptance in principle of the policyadvocated by the Secretary of State for Scotland.  Unconditionalacceptance of the invitation of the Netherlands Government neednot, in my opinion, create any obstacle to suggestions by HoMoGovernment for the addition of new subjects to the agenda later on.                                               WoOoGo                                           28th July, 1932.
