On 12th February last I circulated a, memorandum to      the Cabinet on the subject of sky-writing and sky-shouting      (C.P.7l(32)) ,  in which I proposed an inquiry &quot;by a Select      Committee of the House of Commons.   The Cabinet approved;      the Committee was appointed;  it has now presented its      report, a copy of which is attached.   I desire to obtain      the concurrence of my colleagues for the action to he taken      on the recommendations that are made .                The report makes certain proposals for legislation.      Thesre include the complete prohibition of sky-shouting;  and      the prohibition of sky-writing in rural areas and in boroughs      and urban districts having less than 20,000 population, except      on special occasions permitted by the local authorit.y.      The Committee do not recommend the prohibition of sky-writing      elsewhere..  They consider that the invention, which is in its      infancy, may prove a valuable national asset, particularly      for defence purposes, and  should not be prevented from reachin      the fuller development that it is likely to obtain by its      practical use under a wider range of conditions.   Further,      the Committee were unable  to obtain any evidence that its      actual use by the two operators, Major Davey and Major Savage,      who hold patent rights, had given rise to complaints.   The      Committee point out that in any case, the use of the mechanism      causes no irreparable damage;  so that even if it were to be      found later that further restriction was necessary, no great      harm would have been done meanwhile.                The Committee consider that a central Department
slaould have power to make regulations for securing public safety, in connection with air navigation, coastal lights, etc.,and to protect ancient monuments or buildings of historicimportance .   Prohibition of the use of the appliance on sundays is also recommended.   These proposals would require legislation.          There is a further recommendation that steps shouldbe taken by the Home Secretary to convene a voluntary body,representative of advertisers, advertising agents, firitisengaged in sky-projection and such other interests as he may think should be represented,  with a view to the regulation ofthis new medium of advertising in a manner which will securegeneral approval.   To quote the words of the Committee&apos;sreport (paragraph 44) -          &quot;This bod3&apos; should act in consultation with the     central departments concerned, the associations of     Local Authorities and the Societies who are interested -     in advertising and the preservation of amenities.     It should be able to exercise a reasonable control of     both the matter used in sky advertising, the manner and     place in which it is displaj^ed and the number of     machines operating at one time within a defined a,rea.     The success that has already.dy attended voluntary     censorship, by the advertisers themselves, of     advertisements through existing media makes Your     Committee the more confident that the control which     they suggest for sky-writing should be effective, and     should at any rate be tried in the first instance.     In addition Your Committee recommend that this     voluntary body should operate for any or all of the     purposes, for which Your Committee have recommended     legislative provisions,  until such time as the          )     a,ppropria,te legislation in ea,ch ca,se has been enacted..&quot;          In my opinion auction may properly be taken on thelines recommended by the Committee, and I desire to have theapproval of the Cabinet (a) for the summoning of a conferencesuch as is suggested, with a view to the establishment of a voluntary body of control,  and (b) for the preparation of aBill to secure the legislative powers recommended by theCommittee .3rd August,  1932.H .S .

REPORT.  THE SELECT COMMITTEE appointed to consider the use ofappliances for projecting writing and  other displays on  the  sky,or for broadcasting  speech or other sounds from  aircraft, and toreport on  the desirability  of  legislation in this connection haveagreed to  the following BEPOET :-                      INTBODUCTION.  1. Your Committee have felt  some  difficulty  in  the conduct oftheir  enquiry, first because the technique both of &quot; sky-writing &quot;and.&quot; sky-shouting  &quot; is  at present in its infancy, and  secondlybecause the existing appliances have not yet entered into generalcommerlcial use.  In consequence, though many considerations which are necessarily of a hypothetical nature have been laid beforeYour  Committee, evidence based  upon fact and experience  has beenhard to obtain.   With this limited material at their disposal your committee have endeavoured to approach the problem from severaldifferent angles, and in doing so they have addressed themselves toanswering the following questions :         -  -      (a)  Are the existing appliances or their  potential  develop-    ments likely to  be of value to the State, either from the point    of view of commerce or from that  of national defence?      (b)  To  what extent may the unrestricted use of these appli-    ances  interfere  with  the proper enjoyment  of  natural ameni-    ties ; with Public safety or susceptibilities or with other national    interests?      (c)  If their unrestricted use  is liable to cause such interfer-    ence,  to what extent  and in what way w-ould it be advisable to    introduce control ?      (d)  What  is the existing  state of the law in regard to the    ownership of air space,  and  is any  action  needed in  this    connection ?  2. In their  attempt to answer these  questions Your Committeehave held  15 meetings and examined 24 witnesses.  These witnessesincluded :       (a)  Eepresentatives of the Admiralty, the War  Office, the    Air Ministry, and the Trinity House.      (b)  Eepresentatives of two Companies controlling and using   - appliances for sky-writing.      (c)  Eepresentatives  of various  Societies  and  individual    persons interested in  the protection of public amenities.      (d)  be presentatives of various commercial associations,  both    of firms whose products are advertised and of advertising agents.      (e)  Persons competent to express an opinion on the existing   - state of the law.
I Your Committee have obtained, through the Foreign Office, re-ports from.Various  foreign countries as to the  extent  to whichappliances for sky-writing and sky-shouting have been  used and brought  under control abroad, and they have received memorandafrom the Home Office and from the Board  of Trade.  They havealso examined one  witness who has heard  sky-shouting  used foradvertisement purposes in America.  3.  Several distinct types of mechanism, each presenting its ownset of problems, are covered by Your Committee&apos;s Order of Befer-eiice.   Your  Committee  are  informed  that  sound   may  be broadcast from aircraft  (&quot; sky-shouting &quot;)  either by  the pickingup and  relaying  through  a  loud  speaker of messages  or soundtransmitted  by wireless stations,  or by  a person in  the aircraftspeaking  directly into  a  loud  speaker.    Sky-writing,  may becarried  out  during  the day by the  discontinuous  discharge  ofsmoke or other visible vapour, (&quot; Smoke-writing &quot;) from a movingaircraft which  is manoeuvred so that the smoke trail forms letters;or at night (&quot; Night sky-writing &quot;) by playing a searchlight ontothe  clouds, which form  the  necessary  screen, in such a way thatthe  normal beam  of the searchlight is broken up, either  by meansof a  stencil  or by means of  an  arrangement of mirrors, so as toform letters  or patterns of light.   Apart  from these  methods bywhich words or patterns are written in space or in the strict sense ofthe  word &quot; projected &quot;  onto the clouds, other methods of adver-advertising by means of aircraft are being brought into use, and althoughperhaps  these do not fall strictly within their Order of reference,Your Committee feel justified in drawing attention to them.  Air-craft flown by day  may trail behind them long flags or bannersbearing  &quot; slogan &quot; advertisements, or  by  night may carry electricor neon gas signs similar to those attached to  hoardings or buildings.  4.  Smoke-writing has been practised sporadically in  this countryfor a number of years, and many people have had the opportunityof seeing it.  Night sky-writing by searchlight has, until the. last few years, remained in an experimental stage, and very  little  has yet  been seen in this country.    Consequently  Your Committeedeemed it proper that they should inform themselves  directly of theresults that can be produced  in  practice at  the present time.  Tothis end Your Committee  attended demonstrations  arranged bythe two Companies now operating in this country.   The light effect is novel  and Your Committee do not share  the view expressed by several witnesees  that it is not necessary  to have seen night sky-writing before coming to a conclusion as to its effects upon naturalamenities.  It is  different with  sky-shouting.    Your Committeehave been unable to attend any  demonstration of sky-shouting forthe  reason that it is not in commercial use in  this country;  but since sky-shouting is dependent  merely upon a further, applicationof the loud-speaker, a device now well-known,  Your Committee
           would agree-that the lack of direct personal experience would now-3           so. greatly detract from the weight  of their conclusions in this           respect. &apos;                           &apos;  .                                 SMOKE-WHITING.             5. It has already been stated above that smoke-writing has now           been used as an advertising medium for a number of years.  During           that time it has not come into anything like general use.  Its use           is strictly limited by atmospheric conditions and even under good           conditions the words written  are soon dispersed  by natural air           movements.  Your Committee are not aware that any serious com-           plaints were levelled against this form of advertisement prior to the           general controversy on the subject of sky-writing carried on  in the           Press during the early months of this year.   No evidence has been           adduced which would lead them to suppose  that smoke-writing has           in the past affected the reasonable enjoyment of natural amenities,           nor is there any indication that it is likely  to do so in  the future.Q. 360.      Further, it has  been pointed out  that smoke-writing, though per-           haps only in a small measure, provides employment for pilots and ;i           market for the products  of  the British  aircraft  manufacturing           industry.             6. In view of  these considerations Your  Committee are of opinion           that circumstances do not call for  either the prohibition or the con-           trol of this form  of enterprise and they, therefore, do not recommend           any  change in the existing law.                       SIGNS  ATTACHED TO  AIRCRAFT.             7. Aeroplanes trailing banners by day have been used for advertis-           ing purposes in  this country, but only to  a  small extent,  and Your           Committee  have heard no complaints.   Other types of  attachedQ. 1420.     signs have been tried abroad, as  for instance electric or  neon gas           signs similar to those attached to buildings.  Since these  forms of           advertising  have been so little developed up to the present, Your           Committee have no facts before them upon which to base an opinion,           and  they  therefore  do not recommend  any  change in the existing           law.                                  SKY-SHOUTLNG.  .             8. Your Committee  are informed that  sky-shouting  has been           used for advertising purposes in America,  Italy and Sweden, but           apparently  it has not  met with  commercial success.   From the           account given to them Your Committee  cannot think.that  this is           likely to prove a successful method of advertising.   In any case the           objectionable character of sky-shouting, as  described by those who           have heard, it, is beyond question.  A raucous noise is forced upon           the hearing of men  and women whether  they wish it or no. YourQs. 1355-1359 and1416-1419.
 Committee, therefore, feel that the use of sky-shouting, whether it ile added to the already considerable volume of noise that obtains in an active urban area or in the comparative quiet of the country- side, would be an unnecessary and intolerable imposition.  9.  For these reasons Your  Committee recommend  that  if there are any signs  of its development  in  this  country,  sky-shouting- should be prohibited by law for all private purposes.   .  &apos;                   NIGHT  SKY-WRITING.                   NATOBB AND LIMITATIONS.  10. Night, &apos;&apos;  sky-writing &quot;  consists in the projection of  light on to the clouds at night.so as to form  either words or such other. patterns as may be desired.   There are already known to Your Committee  two  commercial   firms  practising  sky-writing in this country.  This method of advertising  has been made possible by the development  of new methods of  projection.  It is  differentiated from  the three methods just considered in that it is operated from the ground or from some structure  on the ground.  11.  The use of searchlights for these purposes is subject-at anyrate for the present to a number of natural  limitations.   In the first  place, as has  been pointed out,  the term &quot; sky-writing &quot; is  Appendiin this  case misleading;  &quot; cloud-writing &quot;  would be more appro-  No. 6. priate, since no writing is visible unless there is a screen upon whichthe searchlight can project the  image, and the  only  satisfactoryscreen at  present known is  the base of a  cloud.  No writing is possible on a clear  night sky.  In the second place  the real natureof the cloud screen is often misunderstood. Some witnesses seemed  cf. Qs.to speak as if a  cloud-covered sky were in  fact the hemispherical  651-656.dome that  it appears to be,  so that, given  a  sufficiently powerfulprojector,  visible images  might be  projected from  a centre uponairy part of this area from the horizon to the  zenith.   In  fact the under-surface of  a cloud is like the  surface  of the sea.  It is pre-dominantly flat (subject, of  course, to the general curvature  of the earth).. Like the sea, however, this  flatness is on most days brokeninto ripples or  billows, and, unlike&apos; the sea, it may show gaps of greater or less dimensions and the density may vary  considerably.These are factors of some importance in successful  sky projection,as irregularities  of  these types  materially  affect  the  range over which a cloud image may be  seen.  If  an apparently  homogeneouscloud is in fact composed of  several layers  of different  density,  aseries of images, corresponding with the layers of greater  density,will be produced, and  unless the observer  is comparatively close to the projector, a mere blur of light is all that will be seen.  Apartfrom  this the base of a cloud  which is  fully  visible when the cloudis overhead becomes less visible when it -is seen  more obliquely,as the cloud moves towards the horizon.  Consequently the image
&amp;           on a retreating cloud cannot be clearly seen from any great distance^           because it will  become  increasingly distorted.  Similarly  a cloud&apos;           image thrown vertically upwards, which is clear-cut to those imme-           diately below, will appear blurred to observers at a distance.  These           facts would seem to dispose of  the  fear that low banks of horizon           clouds can be used as a screen upon which to throw vertical images           which would be visible  at  an  angle  not far removed from  the           horizontal line  of vision.  It is stated that the average range ofQs. 2 and 3. good visibility is a circle of about a mile radius.  This  is probably           a reasonable estimate.  Under better conditions for projection  this           range may well be increased.  In any case it is limited by the heightQ. 43.      Qf t*le clo&apos;10^8, arl(l ^  is  difficult to conceive  of  it becoming very           great.. .             12.  Apart from  the limitations  imposed  upon  night sky  pro-           jection by  atmospheric  conditions  and visibility,  the  element of           time also enters into the question.   During the summer months the           period of requisite  darkness  is  short, for no commercial  firm is           likely to  continue  advertising its  wares  in this costly way to a           largely deserted or sleeping world.  In winter the  available period           of darkness is far longer.  It was estimated from experience gainedQ. 3.       in England and Germany that on the  average throughout the  year           not  more than  one hour per night is suitable for sky  projection.           Your Committee have no means of checking this  estimate which,           on the face of it, seems somewhat  short for any climate in which           cloudy conditions are  common.  They are satisfied, however,  that           the  average period, in  view of all the  circumstances  mentioned,           cannot be greatly in excess of that stated.                                   PUBLIC  SAFETY.                                     Air Defence.             13. Air Defence from the ground is entrusted to the War Office.           The representative of  the War Office  who  gave evidence before           the Committee  stated that there was a possibility of interference           by sky-writing with manoeuvres at places where air-defence search-           lights were employed.  At present the War Office has not sufficientQ. 968.      power under  the Military  Manoeuvres  Act  to control  sky-writing           in such cases.  Such power of control  was  stated to be desirable.           The witness  stated that the principle  invented by Major SavageQ. 963.      o:f breaking up the beams of  the  searchlight  might be very useful,           as also the reserve that such civilian apparatus might prove in case           of war.                                    Air Navigation.QS 36Q       14. The opinion put forward by the  Air  Ministry was  that the(para. 3)    apparatus  in  use in its - present form  was  not a danger to air-364-367,    navigation provided that it was operated from a fixed and  not a372.
loo  obile base.  While they thought it  improbable that the  beam rom a sky projector in its present form was likely to, be mistakenfor the light from an  aerial  lighthouse or for the lights normallyin use at aerodromes, they wished to ensure that pilots., who mighton any particular night have noted for their guidance the positionof such a beam, should not be misled later in the night by reasonof the projector having been moved in the  meantime.   They  didnot consider that a change of base to a new position on successivenights would be open  to objection.                       Coastal Navigation.  15. Your Committee were much impressed by the evidence givenby the representatives of  the  Trinity  House,  and they  are con-vinced that  danger to life at  sea  might be caused were night  skyprojectors used in proximity to lighthouses  or ports.  These wit-nesses, after having  seen  a demonstration of a sky projector, came  QS- 1431to the conclusion that such a projector, if judiciously used,  ought  et seq.not to be detrimental to navigators, providing that the following-general conditions were imposed.   First, the beam should  not beplaced in the  vicinity of a lighthouse, but  the  exact  meaning of&quot; vicinity &quot; could  only be  determined  by further practical  ex-perience.  Secondly,  the  beam transmitter  should  not be  set  upseaward  of  any lighthouse,  the  term &quot; seaward &quot; being  under-stood to mean at any spot (not necessarily nearer the shore) whereit would  be possible for a mariner to  get the  two lights  in line.Thirdly,  it must be set up either behind buildings or rising groundso that  the base of  the  light  is  nowhere  visible  from  the sea.Fourthly, the  sky-writing beam,  if used in the neighbourhood ofa port, should not  be depressed  by  an angle greater than  aboutthirty degrees from the vertical.  Fifthly, the sky-writing beams,if used in the neighbourhood of the  coast, should give continuousillumination (except for such operations as closing down, changing-carbons,  etc.)  and not  an  occulting or flashing light.  16. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 gives powers for dealingwith the  prevention of false lights, but Your Committee are of theopinion that these powers are not fully adequate to secure the degreeof control thought necessary by the representatives of the TrinityHouse.                       NATURAL AMENITY.  17. While the considerations discussed in the preceding para-graphs are of  importance, it  is improbable that the  /question  wouldhave attracted much public attention but for the criticisms  whichwere directed  to the anticipated effects of sky-writing upon naturalamenities.                           &apos;: &apos;r&apos;-&apos; - -   &apos;  &apos;--           1 &apos;
            Origin of the: Protest  against SkyrWriting.;   18. The public expression of a strong dislike and fear of the potentialities-  tialities of night sky-writing seems to date from the publication in  The. Times newspaper on 1st; January of the present year of a some-  what glowing account, of Major J.  C.  Savage&apos;s invention  for sky  projection.  The possibilities&apos; outlined  in this  article  produced  a  vehement protest from Mr.  Lionel Curtis, and a considerable corre-  spondence developed, the main tenor of which was a strong opposi-  tion to this type  of advertisement.  Your Committee are not aware  that there was any serious  expression of  public opinion before this  date, although some complaints were received by the Scapa Society  as early as January, 1931.   19. During the early months of 1931,  Major Savage had taken his  apparatus on tour through a number of provincial towns.   He put  an advertisement in the local press asking  those who saw the demon-  stration to write to him stating the time  and place from which the1  image was seen; what was written  and  whether the writing was  clear.  At the same time a refund of  postage  was offered, and a  small souvenir promised to compensate for the trouble taken.   The  object of this advertisement was to collect data as to the range of  visibility.    In  reply Major  Savage received a large number of  letters, many of  which were complimentary, and he was aware of  only one complaint.  The results of this series of demonstrations  do not appear to have provoked any appreciable amount of public  protest.                 Evidence given to the Committee.   20. Evidence  was given  to Your  Committee on  behalf  of the  Scapa Society, the Council  for the Preservation of  Rural England,  the  Metropolitan  Public Gardens Association  and  the London  Society, and by Mr. Lionel Gurtis and the Earl of  Crawford.  Ex-  cluding the evidence of Major Savage and  Major Davey, it amounted  to considerably more than half, or, if this evidence he included, to  two-thirds of the whole, of.the. evidence laid before the Committee.   21. Attention  was drawn to the fact that disfigurement of town  and country in  Great Britain, which occasioned the formation of  the  Scapa Society, had already led to the Advertisements  Begula-  tion Acts of 1907 and 1925, which form a precedent for cognizance  being taken by law of the desirability of  preserving the amenity of  outdoor surroundings.  It was further represented that sky-writing  was still in its  infancy.  Naturally, therefore, the  present limita-  tions under which it was operated could not be regarded as per-  manent and insuperable.   The general tendency was to widen the  application of any invention which was found to have a commercial  value.  In the future the  power of searchlights might be yet further  increased.   Moreover, though  at present  the apparatus was useless
13iIra a clear night for want of a screen on which to throw the image, artificial clouds were  not  beyond  the range of possibility  in the future.   22. From the aesthetic point of view, the objections taken  by the witnesses differed considerably in principle.   The  representa- tives of the Metropolitan Gardens Association and of  the. London Society objected to the use of sky-writing altogether and suggested that it should be completely prohibited.   On the other  hand, a dis- tinction was drawn by the representatives both of the Scapa Society and of the  Council for the Preservation  of Bural England. .  This distinction was the same  as that which underlies the principles embodied in existing legislation which empowers  local authorities to restrict  advertisements which :   .       (ai)  affect injuriously the  amenities of  a  public park  or y. 187    pleasure promenade;                                       &apos;  (para. 2)&apos;.       (b) disfigure the natural beauty of a landscape;.       (c) disfigure or injuriously affect the view  of rural scenery     from a highway or railway or from any public place or water;       (d) disfigure or injuriously affect the amenities of any village     within  the district of  a rural  district council;       (e)  disfigure or injuriously affect the amenities of any historic     or public building or monument or of  any place frequented by     the public solely or chiefly on account of its beauty or historic     interest.   In other words, a definite distinction is  drawn between the dis- figuring  effect of advertisements in  places possessing  the natural beauty of  a countryside or the architectural beauty, the result of Man&apos;s handiwork, and the&apos; display, of the  same advertisements in an ordinary urban area. . A different view  was put forward by Mr. Curtis.   He condemned advertisements by sky-writing whether in town or country.  Indeed, he considered their exhibition in towns Qs. 1935- as the more objectionable of the two.   On  the other hand, he drew 193?. a distinction between the sky-writing of  words of good content and meaning such as &quot; Buy British &quot; and the commercializing  of the sky by competitive advertising. A somewhat similar distinction was also made by  the Dean of Westminster  in that he took particular objection to announcements of a  religious character being flashed on the clouds.   23. It was also argued at some length by Mr.  Curtis that the un- necessary introduction of a new medium of  advertising would deflect Qs. 688, advertisements from  the Press  at a time when they could ill afford 694-698, a drop in that source of revenue.which enables them to perform a 728&apos; et a1, great public service.   While wishing in  no way to under-estimate the value to the nation of the service rendered by  the Press, Your Committee are not much influenced by this argument.  In their view it appears that  the type  of  advertisement most likely to be
 diverted to this new ^medium, is that which is now used mainly OL ),hoardings  ;and  electric  sky. signs, ,and  Your  Committee  do now&quot;view a possible  decrease in the number of these with any alarm.                    . Views of the Committee.   24. The various points of view put forward have been very care- fully considered by Your Committee.  The result  of the  demon- strations which Your  Committee attended was  to emphasise a fact that has much  impressed them during the course of their enquiry. Those who have never seen sky-writing seem in the main  to  be opposed .to it,  but many after  viewing the actual  searchlight  in operation  are not  offended by it;  At the commencement  of then- enquiry Your  Committee  were  frankly apprehensive  as to the effects of  this new form of advertisement, but  after having seen it their fears were considerably allayed.   They  formed the opinion that this method of advertising  is far. more pleasant than many of the permanent forms to which  the  people of this country are un- fortunately too accustomed. Two of the witnesses who gave evidence against  sky-writing before the  Committee&apos; asked for arrangements to be made for them  to attend a  demonstration.   A regrettable mischance prevented, this  being done.  As  regards others,  the Committee,, in the light of their own experience,  were not much impressed by  the evidence.of persons  as. to the hideousness of a sight which they had never witnessed.     .   25. Allusion has already been made to the fact that these differ- ent mechanisms, into the use of which Your Committee have been set up to  enquire, are hardly known to  the public in this  country. They are also  only just beginning to emerge  from the embryonic stage in their  development and consequently their potentialities  are unknown.  Nor is there any guidance to be obtained from the  ex- perience  of foreign  countries.   In  the reports&quot; obtained by  the Foreign Office there is little to  show that any of these  appliances, except  those used for sky-shouting, have been developed abroad to any greater extent than in this country.  Beyond  the existence in certain cases of regulations  controlling acrobatic or advertisement flying  (which as far as is known have been framed  on the grounds of public  safety and to ensure the airworthiness of aircraft), no legis- lative  control of the  use  of these appliances appears to have been attempted or even contemplated.    26.  The  task,  therefore,  before  Your  Committee presents  the difficulty that the questions  on  which decisions are sought are pre- dominantly matters of conjecture and not of experience.  In these circumstances&apos; Your  Committee have endeavoured to bring into account two sets of  considerations.  Natural  beauty is a priceless  national  possession,  and  its true  value in human life is  at  last  becoming more fully recognised.  Instances 6f the reckless imperil-  ment! of  natural beauties,  still occur  not  infrequently.  In other
 ases the importance of their preservation has to. be weighed in thebalance against  the claims of national development.   There areinstances, of which the  erection of  pylons is  one of  the most recent, in which the material advantages to be  gained have beenheld to outweigh the harm  done  to the beauty of the countryside.Oftensiveness also may be relative  and not absolute.  A poster which makes  no pretensions to beauty may be tolerable upon a hoardingin a town,  whereas another, of greater artistic  merit,  would be intolerable if it were  allowed  to  deface  a noble architecturalmonument or country scene.  There  may be words and phrases,whether  used in  advertisement  or otherwise,  which  are eitheractually bad or at any rate objectionable in a positive sense.  Thereare others which are good in themselves; and there is a large inter-mediate class which, if objectionable, are only negatively so in the sense that they  are not elevating.  With  the first class this Cbm-mittee is not concerned; they are banned in any case; but with the others  incongruity is the essence of the whole matter.  27. The second set of  considerations is introduced by the rudi-mentary  character of most of the inventions or devices with whichYour Committee have  had to deal.   In  the absence  of practical experience,  it is, of course, easy to embark on  conjecture and  to envisage  possibilities which  may or may not bear any direct relationto the  facts at  present  ascertainable.  Such conjectures have beenfreely put before Your Committee,  and indeed they must presentthemselves to the mind  of  anyone who  seriously considers thesematters.   In such  circumstances there  is  much  virtue in  the in-junction  &quot; obstare principiis &quot;, in  order to prevent the  growth ofvested interest.  The undeveloped state of these  mechanisms, how-ever, also calls for caution of another  kind.   There is not so muchenterprise in business or fertility in invention,  that new develop-ments  should be lightly damped down.  History is rich in instances of well-meant but mistaken endeavours  to stop new developments.The nature therefore of the vested interest which may be  createdis of importance.  If a mistake is made, is it difficult to retrace one&apos;ssteps?  A defacement  of natural beauty which results from&apos;, theconstruction of  ugly houses, unsightly roads or reservoirs, or eventhe erection  of  pylons may be as difficult to undo as it may be to restore an old building that is  defaced or  to rebuild one  which hasbeen destroyed.            \\                          &apos;,.  28. Before Parliament can properly be  asked  on the  ground of interference  with  amenities to impose prohibition or control  on a form of commercial enterprise, it must be shown, first, that ameni-ties are in fact being seriously interfered with or that there is a real danger of irreparable damage;  secondly, that their preservation has at least  as  great a value in the national  life as the development which threatens their  existence.  Your  Committee  cannot acceptthe view that it is sufficient ground for legislative action to show
           that. amenities may be threatened if development  proceeds  alon^           some hypothetical course, particularly when no irreparable material           damage can be sustained.            - 29. Your Committee agree very largely with the view taken by           the Scapa Society of the undesirability of spoiling the rural scenery           of England or the character of beautiful architecture by the display           of sky-writing, whether in the form  of advertisements or of words           good in  themselves but incongruous in  their surroundings.   The           incongruity would of itself spoil the beauty which it is important to           preserve.   There may, of course,  be special occasions, such  as  a           country agricultural show, on which  a display would be proper and           indeed  desirable.   Provision can  be made  for such occasions.           Generally speaking, however, Your Committee feel that sky-writing-           should not take  place in country districts  and should not be dis-           played upon or over public monuments or similar  buildings. In           urban areas, where the question of  such buildings  does  not  arise.           the case is different.   The occasional passing of  letters of white or           coloured light over clouds is not unbeautiful, occurring, as is neces-           sarily the case, only on a limited number of evenings in the  year,           and also for a limited number of hours.  It forms  a  relief to the           squalor of  the poorest streets and to the dull monotony of  many           others.   It is open to question whether the leaden gloom of heavy,           rain clouds will be seriously desecrated by the loom of an unseen           light.  It is not necessary, unless one desires to do so, to follow the           beam to its termination.   In fact this form of advertising may be           less obtrusive, and therefore less offensive, than brilliantly lit  signs           placed on hoardings or buildings at such a level that the eye cannot           avoid seeing them without being lowered to the ground.  This lack1062^1128   G^ ohtrusiveness  seems to  be evidenced by the fact that MajorU29.&apos;    &apos;  Davey&apos;s  apparatus was operating from the roof of  Olympia on           suitable nights throughout  the month of April this year that is,           at a time  when  specific  complaints by eye-witnesses might  have           been made to Your Committee.   No such complaints were received.             30. Apprehensions have been expressed that the advertisements           displayed  will either offend or degrade  the pub he taste.    Your           Committee do not think that so much anxiety need  be entertained&apos;           except perhaps by those  to  whom any form of public advertising           for commercial  purposes  is  offensive.   To exhibit  advertisements           which either by  their matter, their  method of exhibition or  their           situation offend public taste is not good advertising.  Your   Com-Qs 1554-   naittee have been glad to hear that this view is held by the advertis-1556.       ing agents who more and more control advertising in this country.Q. 1593.     and by those whose goods are advertised.  In matters of this kindQ. 1682.     Your Committee are fully sensible of the good work that has been           and is still being done by the Scapa Society, and also by  the volun-           tary censorship that has been set up by the Advertisers and Adver-           advertising  Agents themselves.
13Q. 753.Para. 23.Q. 695.                    POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES.  32. Beside  the possible disadvantages that might  arise from thecommercial development of night sky-projection, there are also certain advantages that may ensue from it, to which the Committee thinkit right to draw attention.  It has been claimed that the industry, Q 5in  that it is carried on in this country under  world-wide patents,lias already brought into the country considerable sums of money from abroad,  and that  the prestige of British trade is enhanced bythe successful operation of  British  invention  in other countries.On  the other hand, it has been argued that this industry is not.going to create new wealth but merely to divert  it from one industry.to  another.   As  has been stated above, Your Committee do not anticipate the dangers  that are implied in this criticism, and theydo not consider that the present is a time at which a new industry,however small, should  be unnecessarily hampered or driven abroad,unless there are  the most cogent reasons for so doing.  33. It is claimed by  the inventor that the Savage  Searchlight bybreaking up the  normal beam into a number of  subsidiary beams, Q Gwhich can be spread out, arranged in a grid or  concentrated at willwithout an appreciable loss of light, has introduced a new technique of actual and potential value for defence purposes.  This claim was qg 6g2-supported by the evidence given on behalf of the War Office, and 695.Your Committee have  satisfied themselves that this aspect of theinventiom has considerable possibilities from the point of view bothof  anti-aircraft  and coast defence.    Such  possibilities are purelydefensive  in  type, as  a  searchlight is  in  no sense  an  offensiveweapon.    Your  Oommittee  are of opinion that this mechanismmight prove  a  valuable  national asset and that it  should not be prevented from  reaching the  fuller development that it is likelyto attain by its practical use under a wide range of conditions.&apos;             RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.  34.  After careful consideration of the advantages and disadvan-.tages that might accrue from the development of night sky project-tion on commercial lines, Your.Committee do  not concur with the  31. Further Your Committee would again  emphasise, the point-that from its very  nature this type of advertisement is evanescentand its use causes  no  irreparable damage; consequently it- is pecu-liarly susceptible to the exercise of an intelligent control.   If,when it is  displayed at some. particular spot, it be found that itsincongruity with its  surroundings is such as to cause reasonableoffence, it is merely a  matter of administrative machinery to insurethat the  offence is not repeated.   The surroundings  will  have suffered no permanent defacement.
opinion, expressed by several  witnesses,  that  this form of skvwriting  should  be universally  prohibited  for  all except  nationalpurposes.  35. Having reached  this decision  Your  Committee  turned their attention to the question of control,  and the form which such con-trol, if required,  would take..  It has been made clear-in  earlierparagraphs of  this Report that some limitations must be  placed upon the use of night sky-writing in order, for instance, to safe-guard traffic by air and water.   Equally, the Defence Services mustbe  in  a position  to  prohibit any private  sky-writing from being-carried on in such a manner or at such times  and places as mayinterfere with the proper discharge of their duties.  These restric-tions have all been considered under the general heaiding of  public safety, and Your Committee are of opinion that power,  where itdoes not at present  exist,  should at once be given to the  HomeSecretary and such other Departments as are concerned to make thenecessary regulations for public safety in regard to this matter.  36. In regard to amenities Your Committee  are satisfied  that acase for some form.of control has been made out, but it is not easy to.  determine  how far these matters, are  properly, susceptible  of successful  administrative regulation.-   The various aspects may be grouped under five main headings :        (a)  Area. Under this heading a distinction is made between &quot;   town  and  country districts.       (b)  Location. This heading deals with the question whether    the base  of  a searchlight  should be confined to  certain sites    within an area.       (c)  Time. This category covers the question of restricting    advertisements during  certain days  or hours.       (d)  Number. The question is discussed whether any  re-    striction should be placed  upon the number of machines that    might operate from any one  area at the same time.  -       (e)  Matter. This heading  covers the question of the censor-    ship of the actual matter displayed in  the advertisements.  37. Area and time are clearly matters that could form the subjectof legislation.  Location is not quite so  easily disposed of.   Toattempt to control questions of  number  and matter from  a central department would seem  to involve almost insuperable difficulties:and those  in the way of giving such a  control  to local authoritiesare hardly less great.                             Area.                ..  38. Por the reasons  which have been already given Your Com-mittee  recommend that  legislation  should be  introduced on thefollowing lines.   In rural areas night sky-writing should be pro-hibited  for all private purposes, a rural area being  defined as any
lural District or any Borough or Urban District with a population&quot;  less than  20,000.   This prohibition should be  subject  to  the proviso that  the local authority of a  prohibited area  may by  aresolution of its Council sanction the use of night sky-writing upon such special occasions as it may deem  expedient.   In urban areasrright sky-writing  should  be  freely  permitted provided  that  the lme and  location of displays are suitable.                           Location.  39. With regard to location  Your  Committee recommend that power should be given to the  Secretary  of  State to make  regula- ions prohibiting the operation of a sky projector within  a  defined iidius of any ancient monument or building of historic importance.Your Committee  are  not prepared to state  positively  what  this adius should  be,  without further practical experience  of  the esults of  night sky  projection under ordinary commercial con-ditions.  A very  short experience, however, should enable  it  tobe  determined what  distance  would achieve the  required effect.These regulations should not only require that  the base of opera-tion should lie outside the denned radius, but that the beam shouldbe  projected in such  a manner that the. image  is  not thrown onthe clouds vertically above the prohibited area.   40. It may also be found necessary to secure that the  base  of operation of a sky projector is not placed on the  ground  in close proximity  to a hospital,  in such  a position that  the glare fromthe  beam enters the hospital windows.  Other  cases may  arise in practice.  Your Committee, however, are not of  opinion  that these matters should  be made  the subject of regulation.   They feel that they may well be  left to the good sense of the trade and the controlof the voluntary body to which allusion will  be  made later.                              Time.   41. Your  Committee are of  opinion that all  private sky-writing should  be prohibited in any  area  on Sundays.   There may also be occasions, such as public services, parades, demonstrations, etc., during  which  it would  be felt that the  display of advertisements by sky-writing would be  out of place.  It  is not  anticipated  that, under such  circumstances, there should be difficulty in securing, by arrangement, the cessation of any commercial sky-writing.   42.  In making the foregoing recommendations as regards regula- tions concerning  location or time, the Committee desire  to make it clear  that their object  is to  secure  the minimum of interference alike with the proper use of night  sky  projection and with the reasonable  enjoyment of amenities  or  the prosecution  of other activities.   II  night  sky projection is not  prohibited it  must,  be allowed fair facilities for ordinary commercial use.
                      Number  and Matter.                    fll  43. The  problem  of  controlling the  number  of  machines  inoperation in any locality and the subject matter  of the advertise-ments displayed  is one  which  has engaged the close attention ofYour Committee.   They are  averse to the creation of complicatedor cumbrous administrative machinery for dealing with an enter-prise that is yet hardly in being.  It is more than probable that were such machinery devised  and put  into  force it would soonrequire  drastic overhauling and reconstruction  to meet  eventualitiesthat cannot now be  foreseen.  Moreover,  Your Committee would point out that such a proceeding would of necessity place additional expenditure upon the nation.   It is frequently forgotten by thosewho complain  of the  growth of the staffs  of  Government Depart-ments and Local Authorities,  and the consequent increase both intaxes and rates, that  such increases must inevitably result from the placing of more and more duties upon these bodies.  44. At the  same time  Your Committee are satisfied that thevarious  trade  interests concerned  realise that there is nothing tobe gained by using advertisements that cause  offence to the public,and  that in their own interests they  will attempt to regulate this new medium  of advertising  in such  a way  as to secure  general approval.  Similarly it will be to their own interest to avoid over-lapping  displays.  Your Committee, therefore, recommend that theHome Secretary should, as soon  as possible,  convene a voluntarybody representative of advertisers, advertising agents, firms engagedin sky projection and such other  interests  as  he may think shouldbe represented.  This body  should act  in consultation  with thecentral  departments concerned, the associations of Local Authoritiesand  the Societies who are interested in advertising  and the preservation-tion of amenities.  It should be able to exercise a reasonable controlof both the matter used in sky advertising, the manner and placein which it is  displayed and  the  number of machines operating atone  time within  a defined  area.  The  success  that has  alreadyattended voluntary consorship, by the advertisers themselves, of advertisements through  existing  media makes  Your Committeethe  more confident  that the  control  which they  suggest  for sky-writing  should be effective, and should at any rate be tried in thefirst instance.  In addition Your  Committee  recommend that thisvoluntary body should operate for any or  all of  the purposes, forwhich Your Committee have recommended  legislative provisions,until such time as the appropriate legislation in each case has been enacted.            Regulations to be laid before Parliament.  45. Your Committee are of opinion that regulations made for thepurpose of carrying out the recommendations which they have made should be laid before both Houses of Parliament with the provision
                           . LegaL .  46.  In the course of their enquiry the Committee were confronted with the fact that legal disputes may arise in connection with thelaw of ownership of air space.   The predominant view seems to bethat the ownership of a piece of ground probably carries with it the ownership of the  &quot; soviet pillar of air &quot;,  and (althoughit is doubted that  light  is sufficiently corporeal) it is possible that j&quot;8&apos;an act&apos; of trespass takes  place if a beam of light is thrown so as to cross or impinge on that air space  without  permission.  In. short,the position is not at all  clearly defined, and Your Committee are ofopinion that if sky-writing is to be brought under legislative controlit must  be protected from  vexatious actions.   Your Committee,therefore, recommend that the law be defined in this respect as wasclone in an analogous case by the Air Navigation Act,  1920.   That isto  say, that sky advertising should be reasonably protected fromactions of  trespass and nuisance in the manner prescribed  in thatAct. ,    .         .-   .      . \  -  47.  The preceding proposals are recommended by the committee as a suitable method for dealing with  sky-writing as  now known orany development of it which may reasonably be anticipated in thenear future.   Witnesses before the Committee adumbrated the arti-ficial production of  clouds  and  of  vertical  curtains of  smoke  asscreens,  on whieh  advertisements would be  projected.  The infor-mation obtained by the Committee about smoke writing does notencourage  the  belief that  the  formation  of  artificial  clouds islikely  to  be a practical commercial  proposition  at any earlydate.  Vertical  curtains  of smoke; moreover, even if found possible,could  probably  be dealt with under  the  law  of  nuisance.  It isimpossible to suggest proposals for dealing in advance with develop-ments which are speculative and hypothetical and may well neverarise.  Should they  ever materialise  or the  control of the inven-tion pass into  the  hands of irresponsible persons,  the suggestedmethods for dealing with sky-writing will then have to be recon-sidered. * Cf. recommendations of  the Committee  on Ministers&apos; Powers, 1932Cmd. 4060).

Paragraph  29 agreed to.  Paragraph  30  amended and agreed to.  Paragraphs 31  and 32 agreed to.  Paragraph  33  amended and agreed to.  Paragraphs 34  and 35 agreed to.  Paragraph  36 read  as  follows:    &quot; In regard to amenities Your  Committee are satisfied  that a case forsome form of control  has boon made out, but it is not  easy to  determinehow far these matters are properly  susceptible  of successful administrativeregulation.    The  various  aspects   may  be   grouped  under  five  main headings :        (a) Area.- Under this  heading a distinction  is  made between town    and country districts.     (b) Location. This heading deals with the question whether the base of    a  searchlight should bo confined  to certain sites within an area.    -  (c) Time. This category  (-overs tho  question of restricting  advertise-    ments during certain days  or  hours.      (d) Number. Tho question is discussed whether any restriction should    be placed upon the number of machines that might operate  from any    one area  at the same time.      (e) Matter, This heading covers the  question  of the censorship  of    the  actual matter displayed in the advertisements.&quot;  Amendment proposed in line 1 to leave  out from the  word &quot; Committee &quot;to  tho end of the paragraph and add the words:-    &quot;  realise  that there is  in  this  country  a  large body  of  persons who    would be ofFended by the use of sky-writing by night  for commercial    purposes  either in rural  areas or in the neighbourhood  of  buildings of   real architectural  and  historic interest,  and  further, that it would    offend many additional persons were the new invention  to be used upon   Sundays.   Your Committee agree that  its  use in such circumstances   would be  objectionable.  Your Committee, however,  would not  feel justi-    fied in recommending restrictive legislation unless  they had been satis-   fied that  tho persons most interested to produce and to preserve public    favour for this new invention  would  themselves be  unwilling to  take    adequate  steps not  to outrage public opinion.  They have  on the con-    trary been satisfied that those  in  control of these  inventions  are  most   anxious in no way to offend against reasonable requirements  of this  sort.   In these  circumstances, and bearing  in  mind the  following additional   considerations:           (1)  the  potential value of  the inventions from  a defence point of        view.
          (2)  the evanescent nature of this type of  advertisement.        )          (3)  the fact that owing to its cost there will in any event bo little        inducement to project in rural areas-.          (4)  the marked distinction that should always he made between        other considerations and those affecting the safety of life, and          (5)  the great advantage at  all  times of  voluntary  as against com-        pulsory sanctions in matters  of good taste.      Your Committee  do  not  recommend (apart  from considerations  of    Public Safety), restrictive  legislation until  at any rate  it is shown that    those in control of these inventions  use them in what,  as  expressed  in    this  paragraph,   Your  Committee  consider  to  be  an  objectionable    manner.&quot; (Major LleioeMin.)  Question put, &quot; That the words proposed  to be left out stand part of the paragraph.&quot;  The Committee divided: Ayes, 5; Noes, 2.               Ayes.                                   Noes.

Mr. Lovat-Fraser was present but did  not vote.  Paragraph  agreed to.  Paragraph 37 agreed to.  Paragraph 38 read as follows:        &quot; For the reasons wkidh  have been already given Your Committee    recommend that legislation should be introduced on the following linos.    In rural  areas night sky-writing should be prohibited for all private    purposes,   a  rural area being  denned as  any Rural  District or any    Borough or Urban District with a population of less  than 50,000.  This    prohibition should be subject to the  proviso that the local authority    of a  prohibited area may by a resolution of its Council sanction the use    of night  sky-writing upon such  special occasions  as it may deem ex-    expedient.  In urban areas  night sky-writing  should be  freely permitted    provided  that the  time  and location of displays are  suitable, but such    urban  areas should have  the power to proceed by way of provisional    order to secure the prohibition of night sky-writing in the whole or pan    of their area.&quot;  An Amendment made.  Another   Amendment  proposed in  line  12 to leave out  from the  word&quot; suitable &quot; to the end of the paragraph. (Mr.  Mander.)  Question put, &quot; That the words proposed to be  left out stand part of the paragraph.&quot;  The Committee divided: Aye, 1;  Noes, 5.               Aye.                                   Noes.  Mr. Lovat-Fraser.                       Captain Bullock.                                          Major Llewellin.

Paragraph  39 amended and agreed to.  Paragraph 40 agreed to.  Paragraph  41  amended and agreed to.  Paragraphs 42 and 43 agreed to.
 Paragraph 44 read as follows:       &quot; At the same time Your Committee are  satisfied that  the  various   trade  interests concerned  realise  that there is nothing  to be gained   by using advertisements that cause offence to  the public, and  that in   their own interests they will attempt to regulate this  new medium of   advertising in such a way as to secure  general approval.  Similarly it   will be  to their own interest  to avoid  overlapping  displays.   Your   Committee, therefore, recommend that the Home Secretary should, as   ,soon as possible, convene a voluntary  body representative of advertisers,   advertising agents,  firms  engaged in sky projection  and such  other   interests  as he  may think should be represented.   This  body should act   in consultation  with  the central  departments concerned, the associations   of Local Authorities  and the Societies .who are  interested  in advertising   and the  preservation of  amenities.   It should be  able  to exercise  a   reasonable  control of  both  the matter  used  in  sky  advertising,  the   manner  and place  in which it is displayed and  the number  of machines   operating at one  time within  a  defined  area.  The success that  has   already  attended  voluntary censorship  by  the advertisers  themselves   of  advertisements  through existing media  makes  Your Committee  the   more  confident  that the control  which they  suggest  for  sky-writing   should be  effective,  and  should  at  any  rate be  tried in the  first   instance.&quot; Amendment proposed at the end  of  the paragraph  to  add  the words:       &quot; In view of  the  fact  that some  considerable  time  must inevitably   elapse before legislation on  the subject can  bo passed into law, Your   Committee feel  that  a useful opportunity presents itself for testing out   how  far in practice all  the restrictions,  and powers referred to in   Paragraphs 35 onwards  could be obtained on the basis of voluntary con-   trol.   If  this proved practicable they  would prefer it to  asking Parlia-   ment  to  alter  the la.w.   It is  for  this  reason that they  propose  the   immediate setting up  of  a  voluntary body ,which should be asked to   formulate and  adopt a policy  within the  scope  of  Your Committee&apos;s   recommendations with regard to the requirements of Trinity House  and   the Defence Services; area,  location, time, number and  matter.  It may   well be that it  would be found  that control could be successfully main-   tained in this way but,  if not, Your Committee recommend that legisla-   tion should be introduced as indicated in this Report.&quot; (Mr. Mander.) Question  put,  &quot; That  those words  be  there  added.&quot;    The  Committeeivided:  Ayes,  2;  Noes, 4.Mr. Lovat-Fraser was present but did not vote.An Amendment made.Paragraph, as  amended, agreed to.A paragraph  brought up and read the  first time, as follows:      &quot; There  are,  however,  announcements of  a  propagandist  character  which, although  not necessarily offensive  in  themselves,  are likely to  offend the  susceptibilities of considerable numbers of people.   It  is not  easy to give a definition which will exactly cover this class of announce-  menfc, but Your Committee are of the opinion  that the  situation will bo            Ayes.Major Llewellin.Mr. Mander.Noes.Captain  Bullock.Mr.  McEntee.Colonel Moore-Brabazon.Mr. Parkinson.
