This note has been prepared in consultation            with ray advisers at the Air  Ministry,  and I put            it forward as representing opinions with which I            entirely concur of a. Defence Department of which  I am            the Political Head.   I should like to add that there            are political and international difficulties  which            are not dealt with in this Paper, but which at the            same time are very present to my mind;  and I find            myself in full agreement  with the Foreign Secretary            in emphasising the extreme embarrassment in&apos;&apos;which.the            United Kingdom Delegation is placed at Geneva.

          NOTE ON BRITISH air. PI3ARMAMENT POLICY.     It is proposed to conclude the present stage of theDisarmament Conference with a resolution regarding thepoints upon which it has been possible to reach substantial agreement.   This resolixtion includes a paragraph whichwill read as followss-        &quot;Air attack against the civil population shall be     prohibited and with this object in view either the     convention shall include provisions whereby the Parties     agree that,, in the event of hostilities between them,     bombardment from the air shall be absolutely prohibited,     or, failing general agreement on total prohibition, the     convention shall include provisions defining strictly     the limits within which bombardment from the air may     be allowed in the event of hostilities-     In my judgment the reference to the total prohibition of air bombardment was necessary, in order tosecure the assent to the resolution of those States who have themselves proposed the absolute prohibition of air bombing.I view., however, the terms of this paragraph with considerableapprehension, because they suggest that we might be preparedto agree to the total prohibition of air bombardment, andthat we are anxious to see such prohibition adopted byuniversal consent.     On 8th July, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs sent a telegram (No- 281 Lol.) to the Foreign Office,with reference to the proposed resolution.    After referring to the possibility of the Americans accepting limitation of bombardment, in lieu of total prohibition,  the telegram   &quot;I feel bound to say that there will be astrong move in favour of total prohibition, thoughthose who advocate it admit that some exceptionwould have to be made for police operations in colonial territories.   Besides ourselves, thereare at present only Japanese and French Delegationsopposed to it, and the French may weaken.    situation may therefore possibly arise in which we shall beisolated with Japanese and in that event I do not know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would wishto reconsider their attitude&quot;.continueds--1-
     In the first place, in so far as the proposed exceptionof bombing for police purposes, in Colonial territories,  isconcerned, the Aga Khan has already stated that if the UnitedKingdom Delegation accept the proposal as a v/hole, congress would make it impossible to use bombing aircraft on the IndianFrontier in the near future.   It would be morally impossibleto continue the use of air power for the maintenance and security in Iraq., Transjordania, Aden and elsewhere.   indeed the Prime Minister himself has stated that it might bedifficult to say, in effect, that we were horrified at theidea of bombing, but that while we would agree not to bombothers we must still reserve the right to bomb our own people.     As regards the suggestion that we may be isolatedwith the Japanese, this overlooks the fact that the italian attitude was contingent on the acceptance of the Hooverproposals as a whole.   We have every reason to believe thatthe Argentine Government consider it quite impossible to give up bombing aircraft.     The French attitude is difficult to gauge.   TheForeign Secretary suggests that the French may weaken; butin effect their position is the same as ours.   I am very doubtful whether they would go to the lengths of proposing the total prohibition of air bombardment, but they will hopethat there will be no necessity for them to state their position.     Tne probable attitude of the Dominion Governmentsappears to me to be a matter of great importance.   TheDominions were originally disposed to subordinate their own interests to any measure which would tend to increase thesecurity of the heart of the Empire, but it has been shown
that total prohibition of bombing would not increase but would in fact endanger the security of this country against air attack.   I would remind the Cabinet that they approved the rejection of a previous proposal for the prohibition of bombing on the Report of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on CD.(Disarmament), presided over by the Lord President, which came to the conclusion that:-           ...... in the overwhelming stress of a war         which threatens the life of a Nation, no         reliance can be placed on the observance of         artificial rules of war&quot;.                             and         &quot;  The proposed prohibition of the act of         bombing on the territory and shipping of         another sovereign State possesses considerable         disadvantages from the point of view of         Imperial defence generally, and decisive dis-         advantages from that of the defence of London         and other objectives to air attack in the         United Kingdom&quot;.         In short, there has been no change of any kind inthe conditions which existed v/hen the Lord President&apos;sCommittee formed their conclusions.   No doubt has been caston the soundness of their opinion that the prohibition ofair bombing would involve decisive disadvantages from thepoint of view of the defence of London.    Nothing has occurred to  suggest that the internationalisation of civil aviationcan possibly provide an effective guarantee against the use ofcivil aviation resources for warlike purposes, and I wouldremind my colleagues that the Ministerial Committee which                                                        v * &apos;\considered this question formed the opinion that the interna-tionalisation of civil aviation was impracticable, - a conclu-sion which has been amply confirmed by recent discussions atGeneva.    There has been nothing to justify the assumptionthat the total prohibition of bombing,  though agreed to inpeace, would,  in fact, protect the civil population in war.
si7.         In view of the foregoing,  I am of opinion that   His Majesty&apos;s Government should remain opposed to the   total prohibition of air &quot;bombardment, and that we should   maintain the position that the only effective method for   ensuring the protection of the civil population is the   adoption of a code of reasonable  and authoritative rules   which were drawn up in the Hague  in 1922/83.                       (Intd.)   L.AIR MINISTRY,     11th July, 1932.
