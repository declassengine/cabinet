9 F. Q (This Document is the,prooertv of His Britannic MajestyTs                         Government).SECRET.C. P.291 (32).                                       Copy Ho.                         CABINET                IRISH  FREE  STATE SITUATION.          Memorandum hy the Lord Chancellor       (acting for the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs)          My colleagues may like to have a &quot;brief resume of recent developments in the Irish Free State situation.       I.  Discussions between the Prime Minister and             Mr.  de Valera in London on July 15th.          A full account of the discussions v/as circulated tothe Cabinet as C.P. 257 (32).   The gist of the discussions maybe summed up as follows:-     (a)  Mr. de Valera was not willing to accept arbitration byany form cf tribunal drawn from within the British Commonwealth.     (h)  The suggestion whioh had been put forward by the IrishFree State Labour Party through the Labour Party in this country that there should be a preliminary &quot;fact&quot; finding Commissionof two members each from the United Kingdom and the Irish FreeState was unacceptable.   It would lead to interminable delay,with no reasonable prospect either of agreement on the commissioner of the result assisting subsequent negotiation between theGovernments.     (o)  Mr. de Valera demanded as a preliminary to furtherdirect negotiation between the Governments, with a view to finding a means of settlement, that the United Kingdom should withdraw the 20$ tariff on Irish free State produoe recently imposed.                                                         This
 This  the  Prime Minister  could  not accept  unless the  Irish Free State would also  restore the status  a.uo by  paying over  the moneys  so far withheld  (on an  undertaking that,  if subsequently any tribunal found  that  they ought not to have  been paid, they would be  returned).   To this  Mr.  de Valera would not agree.      (d)   The discussions thus disclosed  no basis for a settlement  or for the continuance of negotiations.   Mr. de Valera  returned to  Dublin,  and the decision of  tho Irish Free State Government  to impose retaliatory duties followed.              11 *    Visit of  Miss Ellis  to Dublin.           With my knowledge Miss  Ellis (sister  of Lady  parmoor), who is  a  member of  the Society of Friends and a personal friend of Mrs. de  Valera,  visited Dublin during  the second  week In August.   After personal  discussions with Mr. de Valera she brought back with her an  unsigned document  setting out  proposals for a suspension  of hostilities to which, Miss  Ellis said,Mr, de  Valera was willing to agree.   The substance  of  the proposals was:-    (a)   A  Conference of  equal numbers of  delegates appointedby each Government,  to be  held as  soon as possible  (the firstmeeting to be in  Dublin),  to discuss and  endeavour to reach a settlement of the financial issues in dispute.    (Note:Miss  Ellis reported  in conversation  that,  as an  alternative to negotiations of this kind, Mr.  de  Valera  had said  that he would agree to  an  arbitral tribunal  composed of equal  numbers on bothsides without a Chairman  like  the  Alaska  Boundary Tribunal; butthere is no  further evidence in support of  this).    (b)   An immediate truce for two or three months on thebasis of  (i) withdrawal by the United Kingdom of the Irish FreeState Special Duties Order, and by the Irish Free State of thespecial discriminatory tariff against the United Kingdom;  (ii)existing preferences to  bo maintained;  (iii) the suns in dispute                                                           to
 to  be  paid  into  the  Bank  of  International Settlements - to be  returned to the Irish  Free  State Government if the Conference  failed to reach agreement.   These proposals were telegraphed by  me to Mr.  Thomas at Ottawa at the time,  but my view was that they did not really help.            III.  Discussions at Ottawa.         Mr.  Thomas  took  the opportunity afforded by the presence  of Messrs. 0&apos;Kelly and Lemass at Ottawa to have informal discussions with them.   I will not refer in any detail to these discussions since Mr. Thomas will no doubt wish to give the Cabinet an account of them personally.            IV.  Action taken in the United Kingdom to                      watch the situation.         As indicated in  my memorandum circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 278 (32), arrangements were made early in August for the establishment of an Interdepartmental Sub-Committee, under the  Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to keep the situation under review, especially from the point of view of countering propaganda by the Irish Free State Government and mis-representation in the United Kingdom.    The Sub-Committee has held regular meetings;  the substance of the information which it has obtained as to the effect of the special tariffs in the two countries is set out below  (VI and VII).        As  regards the question of propaganda,  it appeared at an early stage that there was considerable misunderstand- ing as to the precise difficulties which had led to the breakdown of the discussions between the Prime Minister and Mr. de Valera,  referred to under (I)  above.    Steps                                                    were
were  accordingly  taken to draw up a full account of thehistory  of the financial dispute.   This account was,with  my  approval, handed to the publicity Officers forissue to selected Pressmen, not for publication as anofficial statement, but for use as an account of thefacts.   The Publicity Officers report that the effectof the issue of this document has been very good.Representatives of the press, both in this country andabroad, have been very grateful and used the document asa means of checking the facts;  there has,  consequently,of late been little or no criticism of the action of theUnited Kingdom Government in the matter.    Great assistance was given in this direction by speeches made by the attorney General on the 4th August and the  Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on the 6th August, in which theattitude of the Government,  as indicated by the PrimeMinister in his July discussion with Mr.  de Valera, was explained,  namely, that the United Kingdom Government were anxious to reach a settlement of the dispute either by arbitration or by negotiation.   In either  case,  progress was possible either on the basis that, in the meantime,both  sides continue with what they are doing now - themoney being impounded and duties being collected - or onthe basis that both sides go back to the  course of practice which they were following before the instalments of theland  annuities were withheld on the 30th of June last.
*v J hi      V.   Position as regards the Coast Defence Stations                     in the Irish Free State.         The position as regards the Coast DefenceStations in the Irish Free State which under the Treatyof 1921 are occupied by United Kingdom forces has been specially examined, and the necessary schemes devised fortheir relief or reinforcement ira the event of attack or threatened attack by irregular bodies in the Irish FreeState (he. the Irish Republican Army).   Machinery hasbeen devised to enable a rapid decision to be taken asto putting these schemes in hand in the event of anemergency.        VI*  Effect of the 20% tariff imposed on Irish              Free State produce in the United Kingdom.         The total amount collected in duties in theUnited Kingdom up to the 20th of August is  120,000.So far as prices are concerned, there has been no marked increase, and none attributable directly to the tariff,except, possibly, in the case of cream, where it istmderstood that, owing to the shortage and comparativelyhigh price of home produce, the importers in this country have been compelled to pay the p*&quot;ice ruling before theimposition of the tariff, plus the amount of duty, for irish Free State produce.   There has been a markeddiminution in the supply of livestock from the Irish FreeState, but, as regards such livestock as has been importedand other dairy produce, there has been no increase in price;  in other words, the Irish Free State exporter has                                                     paid
9 1 3 opaid the duty.   It is understood that the Irish Free Statefarmers are for the present endeavouring to retain theirlivestock, but it is thought that by about the end of Septemberor October it will be impracticable for them to maintain theirstock farther, and the rate of imports into the United Kingdommay then increasec        VII.  Effect of the Irish Free State retaliatory                               tariff.          The principal item of United Kingdom exports to theIrish free State which the Irish free State Government have attempted to attack is coal, on which a duty of 5s. a ton hasbeen imposed-   Notwithstanding this, the amount of coalexported to the Irish free State is still considerable (theamount for the week ending the 20th August being 14,424 tons,or about 30% of the normal exports), and it is understood thatthe price paid by the Ii-ish free State importer includes thefull amount of the tax.   The Irish free State Government havemade special efforts to secure supplies cf foreign coal(especially from Germany); but the amount so far obtained has notbeen large, and the quality is understood to be poor.   The Irishfree State Government also imposed a special tariff of 20$ (inaddition to any existing duties) on cement, sugar and variousmanufactured goods, especially electrical goods and iron andsteel products.   It appears, however, that large stocks of themajority of goods of this kind are maintained in the Irish freeState, and at present the position is that merchants are sellingtheir stock and not obtaining fresh supplies,  either from thiscountry or from foreign sources.        VIII.   Attitude of Mr,  Cosgrave^ Party.          An important statement v/as recently  made by Mr. Cosgraveregarding his attitude on the question of the  payment of the                                                        land
land annuities.    The gist of his argument may he summed upas follows    (a)   There  was no valid legal basis on which the paymentof the annuities by the Irish Free State Government could beimpugned.    (b)   The so-called &quot;secret agreement&quot; of 1923 was in substance communicated to the Irish Free State parliament at the time, and the principles embodied were approved.The agreement v/as,  in fact, a saving to the Irish Free Statetaxpayer, since  by  it the United Kingdom Government undertookthe payment of approximately one million pounds a year inrespect of bonus and excess stock which might otherwise havefallen upon the  Irish Free State.    (c)   V7hen the agreement of 1925 was made, by which theIrish Free State were relieved from any claim in respect ofthe national debt  (including war debt) of the United Kingdom,one of the arguments employed on the Irish Free State side wasthat the burdens they had already undertaken, including that inrespect of the annuities, were all that they could bear.   Havingsucceeded with this argument, it was impossible for them again to seek any remission of those burdens.    (d)   The situation has now altered in regard to thepayment of war debt, and there is the hope of an all-roundremission of war debts.   If Great Britain can got such aremission, the liability she undertook under the agreementof 1925 may be reduced, and consequently a case may arise for aremission of the land annuity payments.              IK&quot;  General Situation in the Irish Free State.          There  has been no marked ohange in the general political situation; interest has chiefly been centred on the                                                   possible
possible activities of the  Irish Republican Army and on theestablishment of a new body  called the Free State Army ComradesAssociation, which has recently been formed.   According to information which we have received, the  Irish Republican Armyhave an agreement with Mr. de Valera not to precipitate mattersby resorting to physical violence, while Mr. de VaUera on his part has guaranteed not to  use governmental forces against theIrish Republican Army should the latter abide by this agreement.The Irish Republican Army however, clearly take the view thatthey are not committed to this agreement indefinitely, and thatthey are only prepared to refrain from activity so long as mr. de Valera &quot;plays their game&quot;.          There is considerable doubt in many quarters as to thevalue of the Irish Republican Arpy as a fighting force, and information which reaches us indicates that an organized attac?iby them eog0 on the &quot;Treaty&quot; Coast Defence Station is considefedunlikely.   The object of the free State Army ComradesAssociation is said to be to support the Government and theConstitution, and the maintenance of the supremacy of the law.They are an unarmed body5 but they hope that by the establishmentof a public organisation for the px-eservation of order they wouldbe able to protect the people from intimidation and to ensure,when the time comes,  a free election..   The organiser,Colonel OrHiggins, is a supporter of the Cosgrave Party and abrother of the late Kevin OrHiggins.          Numerous letters have been received by Ministerscontaining suggestions for the settlement of the dispute between the United Kingdom and the Irish free State.    Specialmention may be made of the action of the Lord Mayor of Cork,Mr0 J.  Daly, who according to all information is a strong                                                  republic can.
n f f*Republican-   Mr, Daly wrote to the Prince of Wales &quot;respectfullyrequesting your good offices to bring about a better feeling between England and Ireland&quot;.   A brief acknowledgment thankingMr. Daly for his letter was returned.   Mr. Daly also wrote toSir John Simon a few days after Sir John Simon&apos;s speech referredto above (see IV) stating that &quot;provided you distinctlyunderstand I act without a shred of authority I would be willingto meet you in London or elsewhere to help in existing situation&quot;After consultation with me Sir John Simon replied regrettinghis inability to make an immediate arrangement for a meetingbut in terms which left it open for a meeting to be arrangedsubsequently if such a course appeared desirable.          Information has been received regarding furthersupposed shipments of arms from the Continent to the Irish FreeState0   In accordance with the decision taken on a previous occasion es,rlier in the year the Irish Free State HighCommissioner^ Office have been informally supplied with suchparticulars as are available.   The Admiralty view is,  Iunderstand, that it is impracticable for them to interceptgun-runners without a blockade of the whole Irish Free Statecoast, with the right to search vessels within Irish Free Stateterritorial waters.   It may be recalled that the present IrishFree State Government have been unwilling on constitutionalgrounds to agree to the latter.IB IONS OFFICE25th August,  1932.
