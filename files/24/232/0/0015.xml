Theunis should be invited to becomeChairman of this Committee,  since then the Prime minister,as president of the Conference, has addressed a letterto M. Theunis confirming this invitation, and II. Theunis has accepted to act as Chairman.   It will be for 1,1. Theunisto decide virile ire and when the Committee is to meet, but therewas a general feeling at Lausanne that Paris would be a suitable-place.   The British Representative will be Sir WilliamGoodchild, CM. G. , formerly Assistant British Delegate onthe Reparation Commission  and Chairman of the Austrian andHungarian Sections of the Reparation Commission, who acted as British representative  on the previous Committee which dealt with the same questions after the Hague Conferen.ce.    jIt has been suggested to M. Theunis that he shouldmakedetailed arrangements for  the meeting himself,  in collabora-tion with the Belgian Government.4.    Central,  and Eastern Europe.   (Instrument  IV appended to the Final Act.)   The decision  of the Conference was -     &quot; to appoint a Committee which will be entrusted     with the  duty of submitting  to the Commission
It v/as decided at the last Plenary meeting at Lausanneto invite M, Georges Bonnet to become Chairman ofthis Committee;   since then the prime Minister,  as president of the Conference, has addressed a letterto him confirming this invitation, and M.  Bonnethas replied, accepting the Chairmanship.     ThePrime Minister, as President of the Lausanne Confer-ence, has also written to the Governments of Austria,the Netherlands and Switzerland Inviting  them toappoint representatives to the Committee,  and thishas been notified to M. Bonnet.     The Committee would presumably have to meetearly in September if it is to report to theCommission of Enquiry for European Union in time forthe matter to be dealt with during the  Assembly whichmeets this year on September 26th,,  it will scarcely possible to convene it before September.  It has beensuggested to M. Bonnet that he should make detailed arrangements for the meeting himself, in collaboration with the French Government.  In his letter accepting the Chairmanship M.  Bonnet undertook to keep the Primeof Enquiry for European Union at  its  next session proposals as to measures  requiredfor the restoration of the countries  of central arid Eastern Europe, and,  inparticular -  (a)  Measures to overcome the present       transfer difficulties of  these       countries end to make possible       the progressive suppression, subject       to the necessary safeguards, of the       existing systems of exchange control;  (b)  Measures to revive the activity of       trade, both among those countries       themselves ana between them and       ether States, and to overcome the       difficulties caused to the agriculutre-       ural countries of Central  .and Eastern       Europe by the lev/ price of cereals,       it being understood that  the rights       of &quot;third countries&quot; remain reserved.!t
Minister in touch with his plena for the meetingof this COiijuid, ttee.  It is not anticipated hy theTreasury-that this Committee will be able to arrive atfar-reaching conclusions and it appears to them sufficient to nominate as the British representatives officers of the Treasury and the Board of Trade who would be able to watch the progress of the discussions on our behalf and report if and when proposals are put forward affecting British interests. These officers v/ould have to remain to  assist during the subsequent discussions at the Commission for European Union and at the Assembly of the League.The names of the British representatives are under theconsideration of  the Treasury, Foreign Office and Boardof Trade. 5&apos;   The .World Economic and Financial Conference. (Instrument V appended to the Final Act.)    The Conference decided  -     &quot;to invite the League of Nations to convoke      at a convenient date and at a place to be fixed      (not necessarily Geneva) a Conference on Monetary      and Economic Questions. .....      to entrust  the preliminary examination of these      complex questions, which are closely inter-      dependent,  to  an authoritative committee  of      experts.&quot; This, of course,  is much the most important of  the Lausanne Committees                                                      3 * The main questions  referred by the Lausanne Conference to  the Economic and Financial Conference were  as follows  j-    (a)  Financial Questions.         Monetary and credit policy.         Exchange difficulties.         The level  of prices.         The movements of  capital.                      4,
  (&quot;b)   Economic Questions.         Improved conditions of prod\iction and trade          interchanges,  with particular attention to  -           Tariff policy.           Prohibitions and restrictions of importa-             tion and exportation, quotas, and other             harriers to trade.           Producers&apos; agreements,6.

The economic sub-committee will contain ten members and the financialsub-committee twelve members.
8c   As regards (l) above an invitation was sent to the League bythe Secretary-General of the Lausanne Conference immediately afterthe signature of the Final Act.    The Council of the League has since set up an organising Committee under the Chairmanship of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.9.   As regards (2) the Governments of Germany, Belgium, FranceItaly and Japan have been asked each to notify the names of theirrespective economic and financial representatives on the  Committeeof Experts.   The British representative for economic questions willbe Sir Frederick Leith-P.pss, K.C.M.G. , C.B., Chief Economic Adviser;the name of the British representative for financial questions isstill under consideration.10.  As regards(.5&apos;) on July 15th there was transmitted to Washingtonby bag an invitation, signed by the Prime Minister in his capacity as President of the Lausanne Conference, to the United States Govern-ment to appoint two experts.   On July 27th the British ambassador at Washington was instructed to address a note to the United states secretary of State in the following terms: -     &quot;I have the honour etc., to transmit to Your Excellency herewithtwo notes on the subject of the world economic conference.   Thesenotes invite the United States Government to be represented, on thecommittee of the Council of the League of Nations which is chargedv;ith the task of convoking a conference, and to appoint two experts to sit on the committee charged with the preliminary examination of tlfinancial and economic questions referred to in Resolution V attached,to the Final Act of the Lausanne Conference.     &quot;I have further the honour to inform Your Excellency that theseinvitations are extended on the understanding that questions of re-par at ions , of debts and of specific tariff rates (as distinguished from tariff policy) will be excluded from the scope of the conferenceand that among the monetary matters within its scope will be thequestion of silver&quot;.
11. The first enclosure in this note will he a further notesigned hy the Ambassador in the following terms:-    &quot;I.have the honour hy direction of His Majesty&apos;s principal secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his capacity as  Presidentof the committee Of the Council of the League of Nations  chargedwith the task of convoking a conference on monetary and economic questions in accordance with Resolution V attached to  the  Final act of&apos; the Lausanne Conference, cordially to invite in the name  of thecommittee the United States Government to appoint  a representative to take part in the labours of the committee&quot;.12.   The second enclosure will he the letter from the Prime Mini-ster transmitted on July 15th.13.   As regards (4) on July loth the Council of the League  of Na-tions met at Geneva and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsmoved the following resolution:-     (l)  The Council accedes to the request of the Lausanne Con-ference that the League of Nations should convoke a monetary andeconomic conference.     (2)  The Council appoints a committee of the Council to makepractical preparations for the convocation of that conference.     (o)  The Council requests the President of the committeeof the Council to appoint the six experts to he nominated hy theLe ague.14.   The French representative proposed  that the committee of theCouncil might invite other States to he represented on it and hopedthat this would he done in order to give  the  committee of  the council as broad a  basis  as possible.   The. Spanish, Norwegian and Irishdelegates expressed the hope  that the  principle of co-opting  repre-sentatives  of States other than those  mentioned in Resolution Vattached to  the Lausanne Conference would be applied not  only to thecommittee of the Council hut  to the committee of experts.   TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs resisted this but
agreed that the committee of the Council should havepower after consultation with the committee of experts to add further members to the committee of expertsif tin.s should prove necessary.   The Council invited the United Kingdom representative to act as Presidentof the committee of the Council.                                                  -15.   The position therefore is that the committee ofthe Council set up to make preparations for convokingthe conference may add to their members by invitingother States to be represented on it and the committeeof the Council may, after consulting with the committeeof experts when it has been appointed,,  add furthermembers to that committee over and above the twenty-two provided for by the terms of Resolution V ofthe Lausanne Conference16.   On July 19th the committee of the Council met and authorised the President to invite the Belgian and united States Governments to appoint members to sit on the committee of the Council.,    The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs said that he would not issuethese invitations until his return to London,17.   The President of the committee of the Councilinvited the members of the committee to ask their governments to consider names of the six experts whichare to be appointed by the committee.18.   The committee of the council then adjourned until a date in September to be fixed later,  the committeeauthorising its President to call an earlier meetingat reasonable notice,   if it was necessary to decidewhere and when the main conference should meet.  This
 meeting might consist of the  diplomatic  representatives of the Governments concerned  in London. 19.    The  question where the  preparatory committee of experts should meet is not  a  matter for  the committee of the Council to  decide, hut the  committee took note of the fact  that Sir  Eric Drummond favoured Geneva. 20.    It has  alsobsen proposed by  the Sub-Committee of the Council  that  the  Expert&apos;s Committee should be invited to draft an annotated  agenda for the Conference.  &apos; 21.   As regards (5)  a communication has been addressed to the Bank for  International Settlements and a letter hasbeen received in reply stating that they will appoint the necessary  experts. 22.    Important questions arise regarding the time and place of  meeting  of  the Economic and financial conference itself  and  of the Preparatory Committee of experts.23.   As regards the Conference,  it will have been noticed that the arrangement  at Lausanne was that the place of meeting should not  necessarily be Geneva.   Therewas general agreement at the first meeting of theCommittee of the League Council (held on July 2 3th)that the Conference should meet in London,  but nothing was settled.24-.,   As regards the Committee of  Experts, Geneva,Brussels and Some have been suggested as possiblemeeting places.    It  is  contemplated that the Committee should be left free to choone its own Chairman; the question
              of Chairmanship may &quot;be affected by the decision as to              the place  of meeting.              25A   An inter-departmental Committee is being set up              to prepare  for the work of the Conference,              26,   The questions which still require decision appear              to be- : -                      (l) the place where the World Conference                            is to meet, and the date;                      (2) the place where the preparatory Committee                            is to meet;                      (3) the date for the Preparatory Committee;                            and -                      (4) its Chairmanship (which, of course, may                            depend on who  the American representatives                            are) .                                   (Signed) M.P.A. HANKSY,                                                Secretary-, Cabinet.hitehall Gardens. S.&quot;vV.l. 30th July, 1932.
