(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC              MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.SECRET.CP.288 (32)                      CABINET.                          INDIA.    Appreciation of the Political Situation by theGovernment of India, dated 20thAugust, 1932,    Circulated for the information of the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the PoliticalSituation in India,  dated 20th August 1932,issued on the authority of the Secretary of             State for India.          The issue of this apprecation, the eighth of the series, coincides with the publication by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Communal decision.  It will be remembered that owing to the failure of all attempts at direct settlement between the communities, His Majesty&apos;s Government, in response to repeated appeals from representative Indians and with the approval of British Parliament, undertook this difficult task because they recognised that without a decision of at least some aspects of the problem connected with position of minorities,  no further progress could be made with the framing of the constitution,  which, it is desirable in the interests of India,  should be completed with as little delay as possible.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have not attempted to decide all the minor points in the dispute between the various communities,  nor have they confined themselves merely to a settlement of the dispute between the two major communities of Hindus and Muslims.  The decision is restricted to the representation of all the various communities and interests in provincial legislatures,  (excluding Burma),  but within this sphere it is complete.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed the hope that once a pronouncement has beenmade on the method and proportion of representation,  the communities may find it possible to arrive at a modus vivendi on other communal problems which have not as yet been sufficiently discussed.          It would be rash to attempt to forecast the effect of a promulgation of this decision or to predict its reactions.
9 r;&apos;i A decision  of  this kind,  if  it  is  to he fair at all, cannot satisfy  all communities,  and as observed  in the 33rd appreciation (paragraph  6),  resentment, if it goes beyond vocal  protest, may take  the  form of active support to Congress by classes  who have hitherto abstained from overt action, or it  may lead to further communal strife.   Reactions to the decision depend  on the nature of the problem, which differs in  different provinces,  and  it  is  desirable to indicate briefly  some facts bearing on the  problem and solutions formulated  by His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   In all provinces except the  Punjab, Bengal and North-West  Frontier Province, Hindus form a majority of the population  and they will have a clear majority of seats in the provincial councils.  In these provinces,  Muslims have in the past been given seats in excess of their population ratio and a weight age on similar lines is continued by present decision.  The attitude of theMuslins in  these provinces,  who are likely generally to be satisfied with local decisions,  is liable to be affected only if there is any strong dissatisfaction with the solutions applied 4Fo  the main Musliia-iprovinces of Punjab and Bengal. Present indications are that  the Punjab Muslims will be satisfied.  The attitude of  the Bengal Muslims is more doubtful.  Muslims in general will certainly welcome the decision to retain separate  electorates,  on which they bave laid great  stress,  though this point may receive criticism from some of the extreme nationalist Muslims.  The reception by Hindus is less easy to forecast.  One of the points which will attract attention is the system devised for securing suitable representatives of  Depressed Classes by establishment, for a limited period,  of separate  electorates.  Some Hindu political leaders,  especially those of Congress Party,  have
 always strongly  opposed this measure, which they represent as segregating these classes from the Hindu community, and they may disregard the fact that unity of these classes with Hindus has been clearly recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government by giving them the  right to vote also in general Hindu constituenc ies.          In Bombay, even though conditions have improved materially during the last few weeks, the strained feelings engendered by recent riots are such that any trivial incident, false rumour,  or misrepresentation of award,  may cause a recrudescence of trouble.          In Bengal and the Punjab Muslims form a majority of the population,   viz.,  in Bengal 55,  and in the Punjab 56 per cent,  of the total population.  In Bengal,  Hindus form 43 per cent,  of the population,  but there is also a European community which,  though comparatively small in numbers,  has a very large commercial and industrial interest,  and which has received large  representation under the present constitution.  This factmakes  representation on a strict population basis out of the question.  Roughly the award gives Muslims 48 per cent,  Hindus 39 and Europeans 10.   This decision may be criticised by Hindus on the ground that their community,  which is educationally andmaterially in advance of the Muslim community,  has received inadequate representation,  and by the Muslims that, though amajority population,  they have not secured a majority in the Council.   Bengal has,  in the past,  suffered from serious communal disorders,  but such manifestations have not occurred recently,  and it may be hoped that there will be no outbreak of communal strife.   There is,  however,  always the background of terrorism and revolutionary activity to which a further impetus might  be given if the Hindu community as a whole strongly
 resented decision.          The Punjab presents a different problem.  Here Muslims outnumber the other two major communities, Hindus forming 27 per cent, and Sikhs 13.  In the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government Hindus will,  it is calculated, get 27 per cent, of the seats in the provincial council, the Sikhs, to whom weightage has been given as in the past, about 19,  while Muslims, in addition to 86 communal seats out of a total of 175, can count upon at least 3 other seats reserved for landholders, and will thus have approximately 51 per cent. Recent events in the Punjab show that this decision will not prove acceptable to the Sikhs who, remembering the days of the Sikh Kingdom of Ran j it Singh,  have put forward extravagant claims and intend to press them tenaciously.  On the appearance of a forecast of the award a large conference of over 800 Sikh delegates of all  shades of opinion was held at Lahore on 24th July in Ranjit Singh&apos;s Mausoleum, at which resolutions were passed not to accept a Muslim communal majority and appointing a &quot;council of action&quot; to adopt measures to carry the resolutions  into effect.  A solemn pledge was taken by all the delegates that they would not tolerate  the domination of any community and would make sacrifices to this end.  It was decided to make efforts to get all Sikhs in rural areas to take this pledge, and to recruit   ) at once 100,000 volunteers to form a Shahidi Dal or army ofmartyrs.  Similar meetings were held at Amritsar and the Sikhs received support from the extremist Hindus, some of whom stated that,  though the Sikhs were numerically inferior to the other races,  they should remember that the entire Hindu community formed a recruiting ground for the Sikh Khalsa or religious army.
          This threat of &quot;direct action&quot; reacted on Muslinsand the rapidly increasing tension between the two parties,was reflected in the uncompromising attitude of theirrespective speakers and newspapers.  The situation at onetime looked most threatening, and any trivial incident mighthave provoked a clash which would have had far reaching results,both in the Punjab and elsewhere.  Fortunately,  wiser counselsprevailed and some of the more moderate leaders of the Sikhand Muslim communities entered into negotiations with a viewto reaching a settlement.  It was not to be expected thatthese discussions between two only of the three parties concerned would lead to a permanent settlement of the communalquestion,  but the negotiations had the effect of stopping,at least for a time, further &quot;direct action&quot; and the recruitment of volunteers and may.have done a good deal to induce a more accommodating spirit.  The negotiations, however,are now reported to have broken down a few days before theannouncement of the communal decision.  Extremists on bothsides may not hesitate to provoke a clash, but the Sikhs mayexperience considerable difficulty in carrying into effecttheir threat to recruit a Shahidi Dal.  The bulk of the Sikhslive in villages and are at present busy with their cultivation,and hence not so ready to pay heed to agitation in a matter inwhich there is no immediate visible objective;  the collectionof volunteers cannot be effected without funds which are not,it is believed, at present available; the propaganda has also not yet been started intensively in the rural areas, but inthe days prior to the initiation of the negotiations was confined chiefly to towns such as Lahore  and Amritsar.  Shouldthe recruitment of volunteers be started in earnest  after thepublication of the award, Muslims  will be driven tocounteraction and any small or unforeseen incident might provoke
                                                          6. a clash.   On the other hand, some leaders recognise the folly  and  danger of stirring up communal feeling.  Congress leaders, on the whole, are believed not to favour any extreme action by Sikhs,  believing that it must lead to serious communal clashes which would injure Congress cause. On the other hand,  there are some who may try to turn the Sikh movement into an agitation against the Government.  The situation has dangerous psssibilities.          Reference has been made above to the background of terrorism which exists in Bengal.  Three serious crimes have been committed recently by youths belonging to revolutionary gangs.  At the end of June a young Indian magistrate was shot while asleep.  His assailant escaped.   His work in suppressing the Civil Disobedience movement in Dacca district had apparently earned for him the odium of terrorists.   On 29th July a young police officer,  Mr. Ellison,  the additional Superintendent of Police in Tippera district,  was shot in the back while cycling back to his house and died a few days later.  His assailant has not been captured. He had earned the hostility of the terrorists by his successful detective work.  It was in this district that Mr. Stephens, the District Magistrate,  was murdered by two Bengali girls in December last.   On 5th August an attempt,  fortunatelywholly unsuccessful,  was  made to shoot Sir Alfred Watson,  the editor of the &quot;Statesman&quot;,  when going to his office.  His assailant was captured, but  succeeded in taking poison,  and died shortly afterwards.   Apart from these three dastardly crimes, dacoities  (the Indian technical term for robberies or burglaries by armed gangs) are still prevalent in many parts  of Bengal;  some committed to obtain funds to spread the movement;  some  to obtain revolvers or other arms.  Ever since  the serious  armed rising at Chittagong in April 1930,
9 o i  ci h,                                                            7.crimes of this nature,  involving use of bombs,  revolvers andother arms, have become increasingly prevalent.  special powers have been conferred on executive authorities byOrdinances which have been promulgated from time to time,and special courts have been constituted with the object of expediting trial of cases.  But in spite of these measuresmany of the crimes remain undetected and,  though nearly800 persons are detained under provisions of the BengalCriminal Law Amendment Act by order of executive authorities,passed after consultation with two judicial officers,  manyorganisers of this movement are still at liberty and,  as experience of last two years shows,  are able to obtain recruitswithout difficulty,  chiefly from among youths of Bhadralokor upper middle class.  In many areas rural population,though loyal at heart,  are intimidated; evidence is difficultto obtain and witnesses are reluctant to come forward fromfear of reprisals.  In spite of this atmosphere of terrorismthe police and magistrates continue to carry out theirhazardous duties with loyalty and devotion.  But the evil isdeep-rooted and it is clear that it is not possible to dealwith it merely by temporary Ordinances.          The Government of Bengal are therefore introducinginto their Legislative Council legislation to replace the ordinance.  The Bill has been referred to a Select committee by a large majority, and it is to be hoped that the council will have the good sense to arm the Government with all theppwers needed to deal with a movement which may prove aserious stumbling block to the success of the new constitution,both here and in other parts of India.  Other provinces arealso not free from terrorist crimes and the infection tnndsto spread.
          There is however a further measure adopted hy theGovernment of India at the request of the Government of bengal, which it is hoped may he effective in improving theconditions in that Province.  Bengal, being far removed fromthe frontier of India, has but a small military garrison,stationed principally in Calcutta; and in the outlying townsand villages a British or Indian solider has never been seen.The loyal inhabitants there do not fully realise that thegovernment have available an army which can be used in a last resort for suppressing serious disorder, while the organisers of revolutionary movements and their dupes fail to appreciate that the Government has at its disposal adequatemeans for maintenance of law and order,  and cannot be over-thrown by force or by the methods of terrorism and  &apos;assassination that they have adopted.  &quot;With a view therefore to encourage the peaceful population, who have suffered for so long for crimes committed by terrorists,  and government servants,  who are carrying out their duties in such adverseconditions,  and to make clear to revolutionary party thepower which they have in reserve,  Government of India havedecided to station -seven infantry battalions in different parts of Bengal with effect from beginning of cold weather and to keep them there so long as circumstances demand their presence.          Recent appreciations have described at length theprogress of the Civil Disobedience Movement since it wasrevived at the beginning of this year.  During the last monththere have been no new developments.  Attempts are still being made to revive interest by raids on buildings seized bythe Government in the early stages of the movement to prevent them being used for unlawful purposes, but participants in
                                                            9  j ,1                                                           9.these raids, drafted in from other districts,  appear toreceive little or no support from local inhabitants; manyof the raids have proved abortive and,  though in somecases a considerable number of arrests have had to be made,the police have had little difficulty in preventing raidersfrom attaining their objective.  An appeal of Pandit MadamMohan Malaviya to observe 17th July as a day of protest against the Ordinances met with little support,  even in hisown province,  the United Provinces.  Generally,  it may besaid that there are still organisers in each province whokeep safely in the background,  but who are supplied withfunds which enable them to keep the movement alive.  InMadras,  a volunteer is said to receive 6-g- annas a day,while in the North-West Frontier Province it is reportedthat the movement, though by no means dead,  is now mainlydependent on secret receipt of funds from outside theprovince.  That the movement is receiving little or no support from the mass of the population is a most satisfactorysign, but it is not possible for the Government to relaxtheir efforts till those who are behind the movement realise that defiance of the law and of the Government establishedby law can,  if successful, only lead to chaos and anarchy.As observed by the Governor of Madras in a recent speech,&quot;however far-reaching the new reforms may be,  they will be seriously handicapped from their very inception if the ideawere to get abroad that law and order were not to be respected&quot;.          Some account may be given of events in twooutlying parts of the Indian Empire.  On the North west frontier, the Mohmand situation and the position on thewestern border of Dir, have given some cause for anxiety.The Upper Mohmands, who are regarded as subjects of afghanistan, have been threatening again to attack Mohmand
 sections who live on this side of the Durand Line and receive allowances from the Government of India.  This aggresive attitude is largely due to the fact that the Mohmands under the political control of the Government of India have recently, on more than one occasion,  opposed Afghan Mohmands in their attempts to invade British India, and the Government of India have therefore announced their intention of sending troops up to the Gandah Valley to assist the assured clans should theUpper Mohmands attack materialise.  In the meantime, the Afghan Prime Minister has been requested by His Majesty&apos;s representative at Kabul to control the Upper Mohmands and has promised to do all that he can.  Owing to the intrigues of anti-Government Mullahs,  in alliance with persons hostile tothe Nawab of Dir,  there has been intermittent fighting during the past few months between the tribes of Bajaur and theITawab of Dir,  who is a staunch ally of the Government.  TheNawab,  however,  has adequate forces available and is confident of his ability to deal with the situation.  Latest reports indicate that the tribal forces hostile to the ITawab of Dir are melting away and no serious trouble is apprehended.  Apart from these two areas,  the situation on the frontier is quiet and satisfactory.   The attitude of the Afghan Governmentcontinues to be most friendly and they have scrupulously refrained from improper interference with the frontier tribesunder our political control.          Burma has been fortunately almost entirely free fromthe Civil Disobedience movement.  Interest here is concentrated on the question whether Burma should form a unit in the IndianFederation,  and this question is being dealt with in a constitutional manner and will be put before electors at thegeneral election in November next.  The general feeling is that
anti-separationists have lost all hope of being successful in the election.  The separationist party is betterorganised and have the advantage that they are able to put before electors a constructive and not merely a negativeprogramme.          A brief reference v/as made in the last appreciationto the attitude adopted by Hindu Liberals to the announcementof the Secretary of State regarding future procedure to befollowed in discussions regarding the constitution.  the fuller explanation of the procedure given by Secretary ofState has failed to allay their suspicions.  The essence oftheir objection is that hitherto Indian Delegates have met in conference with British statesmen to hammer out a mutuallyacceptable constitutional scheme; now they fear that Indians,though invited to consultation,  may not enjoy same statusor be able to exercise tho same influence as they dids at the round Table Conference.  Congress Leaders, such as PanditMadan Mohan Malaviya,  have put forward similar viewscombining them with an attack on the Ordinances and demands for release of political prisoners,  and there is reason tobelieve that they hope to bring Liberals,  who have hithertoco-operated,  over to their camp and thereby strengthen theposition of Congress. On 9th August a large number of Liberalspublished a manifesto reiterating their  determination not toco-operate unless there is a return to the Round Table methodof Conference and they have not as yet made any response toan appeal made to them by some prominent British sympathisersto acqept the procedure now indicated.  They are probablyawaiting further developments aand in particular the effects of the promulgation of the communal decision.
