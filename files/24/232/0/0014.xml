DOCUMENT IS TifiS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC uaJESTY&apos;S govern AuNT).              RAILWAY POOLING AGREE!. JSNT.       Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport.          In the memorandum CP, 170(52) which I circulated onthe 2/th liny, I informed the Cabinet that the London, Midlandand Scottish and the London find North Eastern Railway companies had submitted for my consent, in accordance with the provisionsof the Railways Act, 1921, an agreement into which they have entered for the pooling of receipts from railway borne traffic between points where the two companies are in competition with each other for a period of fifty yesrs and that, as required bythe Act, I had referred the matter for consideration and reportto a Committee consisting of the three permanent members of theRailway Rates Tribunal,consider the Railway Companies&apos; proposals and to hear parties whohad lodged objections thereto, and I have now received theCommittee^ report, in which they recommend that my consent shoulcbe given to the agreement.explained that, while in the past it had been possible to effecteconomies as a partial set off against the falling off in thejlrgross receipts, the existing fields of economies are nownarrowing, and that they have therefore been driven to seek freshfields of economies, without which the continued existence of therailways is threatened.   The Companies regard the pooling scheme as a means of abating unnecessary and uneconomic competition andes a joint effort te save the railway industry for the shareholders, the workers, the traders and the public.CABINET.RET.-P.26lt-( 52).The Committee recently sat in public on 8 days toIn the course of the proceedings Sir Josiah Stamp
         A number of important trading organlsationsj.Xodgedobjections and appeared before the Committee, not however in opposition to the principle or machinery of the Pool but inorder to safeguard their interests against possible prejudice ____under the scheme.   In the course of the proceed-ings -the&quot;BailwayCompanies were able, through their Counsel, to give assurances, asa result of which these organisations, ine3.uding the TradersCo-ordinating Committee, the Mining Association and the NationalFederation of Iron &amp; Steel Manufacturers withdrew from.,opposition,and desired that they should be reported as supporting theRailway Companies&apos; proposals.         I conaur with the Committee in thinking that the assurances given afford adequate safeguards and also meetsufficiently the care of the single industrial firm and twospecial organisations (i.e. certain Wagon Owners and WeeklyNewspaper proprietors) who presented their objections separately.         Objection was also lodged by  the Railwaymen&apos;s Unionswho, like the traders, did not object  to the principle of the pool but sought protection for railway employees from dismissalor the worsening of their conditions of employment as a resultof its operation.   The Unions based their claims largely on the argument that a pool of these dimensions (estimated to includeabout 50&apos;/u of the gross railway receipts of the two companies)amounted in effect to an amalgamation  or working union, and that parliament had, in the Railways Act, 1921, and in other analagousjcases decided that protection of the nature claimed should be afforded to the employees*   The Committee are definitely ofopinion that the pooling scheme does not constitute an amalgamation and indeed this is clear, since the companies will retain their separate identities and properties, separate staffs and managerial organisations,, and separate capital.
         In order to meet the reasonable apprehensions of  their employees, Counsel gave an undertaking on behalf  of  each  of thecompanies that it will not, as a consequence of the  pooling,dismiss any member of its staff falling within any of the&quot;conciliation&quot; or salaried grades who entered the service as apermanent employee prior to the 1st July,  1932.   These gradesexclude shop and similar grades whose employment  has always variedwith the volume of the work, but embrace the great majority of itspermanent railway staff.   In effect the Companies will absorbredundant staff by slowing up recruitment.         The companies were not, however,prepared to debarthemselves from accelerating the age of retirement of any member ofthe staff to such age as they thought fit,  not being below 65 in thecase of wages grades or 60 in the case of salaried grades, or fromtransferring any such staff from one position to  another  ar reducingany member of the staff to a lower grade or position,  with or withouta reduction ef salary or pay.         The undertaking to the staff was given on the assumptionthat the grades concerned continue to be excepted under theUnemployment Insurance Acts.         Letters were subsequently received by the Committee from each of the three Railwaymenls Unions In which they  intimate thatthe undertaking given by the Railway Companies is not regarded asbeing sufficient to meet the circumstances of the situation, and  ireiterating their view that the employees of the  two companies canonly be properly safeguarded by means of the protective provisions for which they had argued, but the Committee notwithstandingconsider the undertaking given to be in all the circumstances afair basis of settlement between the parties.
                          -if-        I have given careful consideration to the assurancewhich the Railway Companies have given to their employees,  and  Ihave no doubt that they go a good deal beyond anything which an ordinary industrial concern would be likely to concede and  aregenerous in their scope in view of the serious difficulties whichconfront the companies.        In concluding their report the Committee say &quot;We see onthe one hand a vital national industry stricken during a periodof unexampled depression to a point which threatens exhaustion,and on the other a plan which holds good promise of relief,temporary in any case, permanent it may be hoped.   This relief isooming from the quarter from which relief comes best, namely theexertions of the parties themselves, and to these a poolingagreement must be the prelude.   Such an agreement, already validat law, has not been rendered otherwise by the Railways Act of1921 if it should obtain your consent.   In our opinion thisagreement is one to which Section 19 contemplated your consentshould be given.&quot;        I accordingly propose to give my consent to the PoolingAgreement.   A decision is urgently desired by the Companies,partly in order to facilitate accounting arrangements and to enableeconomies to be expedited, and partly to enable the Companies togive increased holiday facilities in the way of interchange        ;bookings etc. without delay.        Immediately after my decision has been given I propose to publish the Committee&apos;s Report.   V/hile it is unnecessary to trouble the Cabinet to peruse the report, it is a clear andconvincing presentation of the argument for the pool and shouldhave an enlightening and reassuring effect on public and parliamentary opinion.                                 (Intld.)  P.J.P.23th July. 1952.
