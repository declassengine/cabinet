             TrawliKg la the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde.        MsjHoraaduia  by the Secretary of State for Scotland.,           Memor&amp;ii&amp;s hare been circulated by the  Secretary of State for foreign Affairs,,  the President of the  Board of trade and the  Blrst Commissioner  of Works, out those of the President of the Board of Trade and the First Commissioner of Works on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries are  clearly based apon an imperfect appreciation of the proposal -which I put forward last January in C,.&apos;*\35 (32) and which was approved by the Cabinet on the  11th February.      2*    I  am  not  asking the Cabinet to claim the Moray Firth and  Fixth of Clyde  as Territorial Waters;   I  am  not asking that they siiould  be  recognised as  *exclusive  fishery  limits53.   What is proposed  is  simply a s^seial international  agreement  to be embodies  in  a convention.    (See  paragraph 5  of  my memorandum C0P035(33) and  the  ^Draft Note to fietherlands  Minister?  annexed to C0P0237(32)  by  the  Secretary  of State for  Foreign  Affairs0)  fhat such a convention does not  affect the general  question of territorial  jurisdiction is shown by the instance  of the  United States Liquor Convention which  the  President sites.   Moreover, far  fx-am  the interests of the  cod net  fishermen  being the pre- dominant  factor suggested in paragraph 7 of the memorandum of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, it was  pointed out inmy memorandum C,P035(32)  of the 22nd  January last  (paragraph 8) that  the ITQIUS of the white fishing by line and  seine nets in the moray  Firth  is ten times as great aB  the value of  the cod net                                                      fi ehing/                               CD
 fishing,,  important  a a that  la,,    These memoranda ignore  the easts for  say proposal in C0P0  35(32)  and  while they contain criticisms which may or may not be valid against proposals which ha-513 been put  forward by my predecessors, the old arguments are no longer relevant  to the new proposal      5S    5hey make ite however,, abundantly clear that no  new question  lias arisen since the Cabinet reached their decision  on Iit..i February,, and  the Cabinet  will  observe from the memorandum of the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that any difficulties of procedure arising on the terms of the Cabinet*s conclusion have been adjusted  between  the  Secretary of State and myself,, as ^suggested by the Prime Minister in his llinute0      40    Meanwhile,  it has occurred to  me that  the policy which the Cabinet has approved might  be given  clearer  and more accurate expression and be made more acceptable to my colleagues  if paragraph 3 of the  aDraft SJote  to Netherlands Minister&quot;  were modified  so as to read:  &quot;3.  H0M0 Government desire therefore that the  Agenda of  the Conference should include discussion of the possibility of  making arrangements under which,  with the agreement of the signatories  of the  north Sea Conventions  their trawlers  would observe the  same restrictions as  apply to British trawlers  in pursuance of the  herring Fishery (Scotland)  Act,  18890*           Shis form is more elastic  than the form appended to the foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum^,    My objects in suggesting i.% are to byizsg out more clearly the distinction between my proposal and that  which lias  been put forward  on previous  occasions  for exclusive  fishery limitst to  emphasise the  safeguard  which it contains  for the position which  other departments are concerned to :defend9 and to facilitate  that  cautious  general opening of the  subject which will obviously be advisable at the Conference0 For sample, in the event,  unlikely as 1 believe it to be for reasons which I explained to  the Cabinet in February, ofunacceptable demands being  put forward by Iceland or any other                              (2)                    country/
    country the above formula would enable machinery to be sot up    for excluding them.         5C   I append a complete copy of the Draft Mote embodying    the foregoing suggested substitute for paragraph 5.    Paragraph    2 gives effect to the minor alterations mentioned in the Foreign    Secretary&apos;s Memorandum with the addition of a reference to the    Committees who have enquired into the question.         60   I submit that as the question was fully considered by    the Cabinet on 11th February, as no new point of eubstance has    arisen, and as the difficulties of procedure have been adjusted    by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet*s    previous approval of the policy should be confirmed and a note    should be sent to the Netherlands Government on such modified    lines.              If my colleagues approve, it would be desirable to    proceed as soon as possible because the attacks which are being    made on the Government from two different quarters are likely    to attract growing support from&apos;moderate opinion in Scotlands    unless a public answer can be given to them by an announcement    of the adoption of this course.

      3?ra.ft; Mote to. H l^riL^^^USliyuSi  ^^^ ^JjS&amp;                        suggested modifloations.                                                     Foreign Office,                                                            1932.Sir,          1 have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in the United Xingdom have given their careful consIdera-tion to tho invitation which you were so good as to convey totSass on behalf of the Netherlands Government in your note He. 622of the 22ad May, 1931, to attend a conference at The Hague to revise the international Convention Regulating the Police ofthe Horth Sea Fisheries of the 6th May, 18820    I am now able toinform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government will have much pleasurein taking part in the revision of the convention, and that they agree that the points enumerated in your note under reply are suitable for discussion.     2,   His Majesty&quot;s Government desire, however, that the position with regard to trawling in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clydeshould be taken into consideration on this occasion.    As you aredoubtless aware, trawling in these areas is prohibited in pursuanceof the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act, 1889.   Since 1907, however,the prohibition has not been enforced against foreign trawlers andforeign trawlers, therefore, enjoy a privilege over British trawlersby admission to the firths.   Their admission arouses great complaintfrom the local fishermen, and His Majesty&quot;8 Government feel thatthese complaints, which have been endorsed by several Committees of inquiry, are not without justification.     3.   His majesty Government desire, therefore, that the agenda of the conference should include discussion of the possibility ofmaking arrangements under which,  with the agreement of the signatories of the North Sea Convention, their trawlers would observe the samerestrictions as apply to British trawlers in pursuance of the Herring                                                         Fishery/
Fishery (Scotland) hot, 1889,   40     I should be greatly obliged if you would bo sogood as to inform me,., in due course9 whether this proposedaddition to the agenda of the conference would be agreeable tothe other Governments concernedv
