Note of 1st  Meeting  of a Conference held on       August  30th  (Annex II);           III.  Note of 2nd Meeting on  September 1st  (Annex  III);           IV.  Minute  by Parliamentary  Counsel on the       Parliamentary time-table (Annex IV)0I. para.(l)0  (2; Irish Free State.                THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that, if a separate       agreement were made with the Irish Free  State, a separate       Bill would be necessary, but asked whether, if agreement       were to be reached on  other points, there was anything  in       the Ottawa Agreements  to which the  Irish Free State       might take objection,.                So  far  as the Conference  was aware, the answer       was in  the negative; but it was pointed  out that the       modification under Article 5 of the Canadian Agreement
 of the conditions governing the importation into  the United Kingdom of live  cattle from Canada might conflict with Irish Free State  interests,,      (3)  Duration of.....new.....Duties?  Should a time-limit                     be  imposed l:a the Bill? a           THE PRII.S lill-vlSTSS said that this raised an important question of  constitutional policy,,  The House of  Commons was very  jealous of its powers of con- trol over fiscal mattersP and most unwilling  to bind itself, and still more  its successors,  for any  future period beyond the financial year,,   3xii  the Bill as drafted would bind Parliament indefinitely,  subject only to  the right  of the Executive to denounce the Agreements after a specified intervals   The Ottawa Agreements constituted an entirely  new departure in  the fiscal policy of  this country:   and he anticipated that the Free Trade element, in the House  of Commons would argue  that the proposals should be  treated as  an experiment,  not to be extended beyond  the initial period contemplated in the Agreements  without  fresh  authority being  obtained  from parliament to          Further,  he personally felt considerable  appre- hension lest  the working of  the Agreements should prove unsatisfactory in certain respects&quot; for instance,  the Dominion Tariff Boards were bound to give our representa- tives right of audience, and would no doubt do  so;   but what  guarantee had we that our representations, howeverjwell-founded, would be given due effect in the recommendations of  the Board?  He felt that it would bemuch  easier to justify the new duties politically if a time-limit were imposed in the Billo
                                                        0 O rf          MR, GRANVILLE RAM observed that - the Agreements  &apos; -appeared to contemplate the retention of the new dutiesad infinitum, unless either party should denounce the-Agreement\  if therefore the Bill limited the duration of the duties to a certain period only, could it be saidthat we were giving full effect to the Agreements, as the title of the Bill professed to do?  He thought that; ifa time-limit were imposed, some modification of the wording of the title might be necessary0          THE PRIME MINISTER however was satisfied that parliament must in some form be secured the right to pronounce again on the Agreements after a certain period,and thought that it should be possible to find a suitableformula, (ecg? that the duties may be continued after 5 years if before 4-g- years have elapsed an affirmatcryResolution has been passed by Parliament,) which wouldinvolve no departure from the terns of the Agreement.     (4)  Date of Operation of Dutiesv          THE PRIME MINISTER observed that the Billcontemplated that the duties should not necessarily ailcome into force at the same time.   It was explained thatthe only case in which postponement was likely to takeplace was India,.  Until &quot;in the opinion of the Treasury&quot;India was &quot;in a position to fulfil the agreement&quot;, the                                                        ) * united Kingdom v/ould refrain from imposing any new dutywhich was provided solely in the Indian Agreement.  But inthe meanwhile India would of course enjoy (a) the benefitof any duties which might have been imposed under
        agreements made at  Ottawa with other &quot;assenting countries&quot;,        and (h)  freedom, under  S.4  (2) of the Import Duties Act,        from the ad  valorem duties  under that Act; and she would        continue to  enjoy those benefits unless and until the        Treasury were  satisfied that  she was not fulfilling the        agreements and accordingly  made an Order directing that she        he  deemed not  to he an  &quot;assenting country&quot; for the purpose        of  the Act..  (9).        (5)  Parliamentary Time-table,,                  THE  PRIMS MINISTER  observed that the time-        table as set out in Mr. Ram&apos;s Minute did not appear to        allow sufficient time for the Lords to pass the Bill        through  all  stages  in time  to enable the new Session to        begin on the 15th November, which he regarded as the        latest permissible  date.    The Conference then discussed        two alternative suggestions,  (i) that Parliament should        meet on  October 18th, be prorogued on November 18th,        and meet again for  the  new  Session on November 22nd,        adjourning for the  Christmas  recess on December 22nd,        and (ii) that  the above time-table should be put forward        a week,  Parliament  meeting  on October 11th, being        prorogued on November 10th, and meeting again for the        new Session  on November 15th.  After considerable dis-        cussion  the  Prime Mini ster decided that the second        alternative  must be adopted,  arid desired Mr, Ram and        M?.% Harris to  work  out  a revised time-table accordingly.                  A  copy of the revised time-table, as        subsequently approved by the  Prime Minister, is attached        (Annex V).
II.  Page 20        .(6)   Drawbacks,                        THE  PRIME MINISTER  remarked that he had a.              certain number of complaints  of  the  absence  of              drawback  under the Import  Duties Act, end he thought              the point would be raised  in  debate  on the Ottawa              Bill.                        SIR  E. PCRBER said  that the Import Duties              Advisory  Committee had power  to  recommend the              allowance of drawback, and had in fact recently  done              so in  one case.  His  impression  v/as  that  there was              no wide-spread demand for  allowance  of drawback.    Page 5.         (7)   Prohibition of Russian Dumping.                        SIR  YARREN  FISHER said that, having              received  the necessary authority from the Chancellor              of the Exchequer and  the President of the Board  of              Trade, he was  about to submit to the Prime Minister              a recommendation that the  Foreign Office  should  be              requested to take the necessary  steps to  denounce the              Russian Treaty forthwith,  witli a view to  the              negotiation of a fresh treaty which would provide for              the prohibition of Russian imports in conformity with              the intention  of the  Canadian Agreement,  if  occasion              should arise.                        THE  PRIME MINISTER  said that, until he read              the present paper, he had  not fully realised that              this Article of the Canadian  Agreement involved  the              immediate denunciation of  the Russian Treaty, and              he felt very uneasy about  it. Although the  clause
        in the Bill was drawn in general terms, it would at        once he clear that it was directed against Russia and        no one else0   The prospect of negotiating a new treat;/        that would give us satisfactory commercial terms while        providing for the fulfilment of the Canadian Agreement        was not encouraging,    Russia had been very off-hand        with us lately; she had been turning more and more        towards the U.S.A. and Germany for trade, and he could        not but be greatly concerned at the prospect of further        unemployment consequent on the loss of Russian orders.        However, there was the Agreement, and it must be carried        out; but he would have to consider whether he should        consult his colleagues further before authorising action        in accordance with Sir Tar re n Fisher&apos;s submission.,para.4,           (3) fate of Publication of the Agreements^                     THE PRIME MINISTER fully agreed that the        proper course was to publish all the Agreements        simultaneously in all the signatory countries, a few days        before the meeting of Parliament.   Assuming that        Parliament met on October 11th this v/ould mean release        of the documents to the Press on, say, the previous        Wednesday for publication in the morning papers of Thursday        October 6th,   &quot;Ye should endeavour to dissuade the        Dominions from earlier publication.   He approved the        despatch by the Dominions Office of a telegram for this        purpose, which would state that we &quot;were at present        contemplating that Parliament should be summoned to meet        on October 11th.&quot;
       (9)  SIR WARREN FT8HER said that he had arranged for the draft Bill to he discussed hy the Inter-departmental conference next day at 10.30 a0m. and the PRIMS ministers aid that he would preside himself if he could spare thetime, as he would like to familiarise himself with theBill as much as possible.      (10)  THE PRIME MINISTER directed that a copy ofthe Minutes should he sent to the Cabinet, care beingtaken to get them at once to Ministers concerned withOttawa.
                                                    hi o i              A_N_JI.JS._X___I.      OTTA\v&quot;A, AGRE5MLNTS  LEGISLATION.          Two meetings have been held, under&apos; thechairman ship of Sir 7/arren Fisher, with representativesof che Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture5Customs, Dominions Office, and Parliamentary CoTinsel-Copy of the notes of proceedings, and of a Minute by parliamentary Counsel on the question of the parliamentary programme, are attached.          The conclusions cf the Meeting may be summarisedas follows:     (l)  The Agreements in full should be scheduled tothe Bill, the title of which might be; &quot;A Bill to giveeffect to certain Agreements entered into at Ottawa.&quot;     (2)  The Bill should as far- as possible cover thewhole of  the action undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Agreements, including e.g. measures for the controlof Meat Imports (Australian Agreement Article 5 and schedule K) and prohibition of imports from Russia(Canadian Agreement Article 2l), which would takethe Bill  outside the definition  of a Money Bill for thepurposes  of the Parliament Act.     (3)  The clauses of the Bill should as a rule either-follow  strictly the language of  the Agreements, or givethe Executive general powers to  carry out the Agreements.     &quot;(4)  The new duties should  be set out in a separateSchedule  to  the Bill (in some  cases more precise definitionmay be  required  than is used in  the Agreements, withoutof course departing from  the intention of the Agreements),     (5)  The Bill should itself impose the new dutieswithout limitation of date, the  initial period in the                       -8- &apos;
Agreements being merely a minimum period.          (The attention of Ministers is drawn to thepolitical implications of this recommendation.   TheOpposition may very likely press for a limitation of the life of the new duties to the i initial period of the Agree-ment, or say a maximum period of 5 years, unless Parliamentshall otherwise determine.)     (6)  Power must be given to the Treasury by Order;-            (a)  to postpone the imposition of any duty to      a date later than the passing of the Act (to meet the      contingency that legislative approval of a particular      Agreement may be unduly dels3red or even refused e,g,      by India);            (b)  to revoke or suspend a duty if the Dominion      concerned (or if more than one is concerned, if all      those concerned) denounce or default on an Agreement;            (c)  to reimpose any duty so suspended after a      default if the Dominions concerned subsequently agree      to carry out the Agreement;           (d)  to revoke or reduce any duty by agreement      with all the Dominions concerned,     (7)  The Bill should provide that certain of the new duties  (viz:  wheat in grain, flat white maize, copper andlinseed) v?hich were originally on the Free List under theImport Duties Act, and which have now been imposed inreturn for specific concessions by the Dominions, shouldnot be  susceptible  of alteration by the Import duties advisory Committee;   but that the other new duties shouldbe subject to the right of the Advisory Committee torecommend an additional duty in respect of the samecommodities (but not a decrease of duty, since that wouldbe contrary to the Agreement.)
239     (8)  Irish Free State,          No agreement. having &quot;been reached with the IrishFree State at Ottawa, the benefit of Section 4 of theImport Duties Act will not be extended to them after-November 15th, as it will to those Dominions which have entered into and are adhering to Ottawa Agreements.          The suggestion was made at the Conference thatthe Bill might include power to apply the benefit of thenew Ottawa duties to the Irish Free State in the eventof a satisfactory agreement being reached with themhereafter.   It seems clear however that this v/ould be beyond the scope of the Bill, which is intended &quot;to giveeffect to agreements entered into at Ottawa&quot;, as wellas politically inexpedient.   If an agreement issubsequently entered into with the Irish Free State,it would seem that fresh legislation will be requiredto give effect to it.     (9)  Parliamentary Time-table.          Following On the Minute by Mr. Granville Ram,it is thought that eleven days debate should be sufficientto pass the Bill through the Commons, beginning onOctober 17th, Monday, and ending on November 8th (Tuesday),just a week later than the date on which, if parliament had met on Thursday October 27th and been immediatelyprorogued, the business of the new Session would have.begun.    This would scarcely give time for the lords to pass the Bill through all stages by the 15th November,but this seems scarcely necessary, since there is power tothe Treasury, under Section 4 (3) of the Import DutiesAct, to extend the period of Dominion exemption afterNovember 15th, and this power could be used to cover the interval between November 15th and the date of the                    -10-
230Bill &quot;becoming lav/o     (10) Date of Publicati on of the Agreement s.          It is of course essential that the Agreementsshall be published in full in this country a few,  say 5,days before Parliament meets.    Simultaneous publicationby all parties is clearly the course to be preferred, ifpossible, and it is proposed, as scon as the parliamentary time-table is approved, to info3?m the Dominions and invitetheir concurrence in simultaneous publication on sayOctober 12th.   It is possible hov/ever that Mr. Bennettmay wish to lay the Canadian Agreement before his Parlia-ment earlier;   in that case there must be separate publica-tion of that Agreement in the United Kingdom at the sametime as in Canada.    Such earlier publication would not  belikely to cause serious forestalling in this country,though it should be avoided if possible.

Article h  This will recpuire resolutions in theHouse of Commons.         &quot; Article g.  It was agreed that while the ImportDuties Advisory Committee cannot  reduce any of the new dutiescontrary to  the terms of the Ottawa Agreements, the new agreements cannot operate to deprive U.K. producers of theright to apply  to the Advisory Committee for an increase ofany existing duty as provided -under the Import Duties Act.          It was agreed that the  Ottawa duties fall into two classes -     (i)  &quot;Ttieat in grein, flat white maize, copper and     linseed which were previously on the free list under the     Import Duties Act.   It should he  provided that these     cannot he altered hy the Advisory Committee.     (li) Other duties which were not on the original free     list and which  the Advisory  Committee has power to     alter at presento  It should he provided that these     duties may he varied upwards on the recommendation of     the Advisory Committee.                          -13-

It  v/as agreed  that the Home Office should be con- suited as  regards the effect of the Article on the Isle ofMan-          Article 3* The question v/as considered whetherspecial legislation v/as needed, to bind the Government notto reduce the 10$ ad valorem duty contemplated in thisArticle to be imposed on foreign goods specified in ScheduleC;  or whether it would be sufficient to leave to the treasury the power of refusal in case the Advisory Committee should recommend putting such goods on the free list.          After  some discussion it was agreed that theDominions would  certainly expect the u%Ko Government to bind themselves  as  formally es possible to  carry out theAgreements, and  that the best way  to  provide this would, be
A/ &amp; t)to  schedule the Agreements  as  they stand to  the Bill takingpower in  the body  of  the  Bill  to  carry out the  s tepsnecessary to give  effect  to  the Agreements.   This v/ould be satisfactory to the Dominions; v/ould conform v/ith the precedent of Acts  ratifying foreign commercial  treaties;and should result  in  simplification of the BillQ          As regards  tho  date  of  legislation, the Chairmansaid that the Prime Minister v/as  prepared, if necessary,to  advance the date of reassembly of Parliament by,  sa3^,aweek, that is, from October  27th  to  October  20th  if  theConference advised that the  necessary legis3.ation could begot through in approximately a fortnight under  the guillotineIt v/as agreed that there  should be no difficulty  in  doing this under the following  time  table;-          Resolutions and Report       3 days          Second Reading               2  &quot;          Committee stage             4  :&apos;          Report and.

As the Article stands it would apply to any country who subsidises the prices of exports to the United Kingdom.Sir Henry Fountain stated, however, that the Dominion repre-sentatives were told definitely that there would be no interference with existing treaty rights other than theRussian Treaty which it -would he necessary to denounceimmediately.  It was agreed that Sir Warren Fisher should  ask the Chancellor whether he wished the Russian treaty to be denounced forthwith.  If so, and if the President of theBoard of Trade concurred, the two Ministers would presumahlymake a joint submission to the Prime Minister, since thematter did not seem to have been explicitly settled bySaturday&apos;s Cabinet.          It was pointed out that the Article as it standsdoes not provide protection for United Kingdom producers butonly for the Dominions, and it was naturally to be expectedthat the United Kingdom producers would claim similar treat-ment.  That, however, could not be dealt with in the OttawaBill.          Article 22 provides that the Agreement shall remainin force for five years.  Care must be taken to see that thetime limit in the case of each Dominion is in strict accord-ance with the Agreement with that Dominion.          Article 25 provides for variation in the terms ofthe Agreement after consultation between the two Governments.Provision is to be made accordingly in the Bill.          Schedule A.   Parliamentary Counsel should beasked whether special legislation is required to implement the provisions of this Schedule.
          Article 5 deals with light wines and requireslegislation.          Articles 4 and 5 are the same as 3 and 4 in theCanadian Agreement with slight modifications of wording, theCanadian version being the more accurate,          Article S Schedule H - Meat.  It v.rao agreed thatthe clauses in the Bill should be kept as general in terms as possible providing;, e.gs; for the regulation of importsof foreign meat by licence or otherwise in such v/ay as notto exceed the amounts specified in the Schedule.          The Bill should provide also for penal action inthe case of an offence against the regulations, eeg., byprohibition of imports from the offending country, or bydrastic reduction of their quota.          Power must also be taken to supervise the workingof the scheme.          The meat companies would be consulted forthwithby the President;  there were four possible schemes ofprocedure; and it was uncertain which would finally beadopted.   Tho procedure would be discussed between theBoard of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and Customs.                   NEW ZEALAND.

Attention was drawn to an unpublished letter  fromMro Baldwin to the Prime Minister of Newfoundland dated the13th August providing that the Agreement between the tweparties should lapse unless a certain quantity of iron  ore from Newfoundland v/as taken hy IKK,, importers.    It v/as agreed that no special reference should be made to this letter in the Bill, but the question arose supposing theAgreement should lapse under the terms of the letter whatwould be the effect on Newfoundland imports into thiscountry, e.g., whether the 10p duty on foreign cod liver oilwould apply to Newfoundland oilV  It was felt desirablethat the general clause in the Bill dealing with the case ofa Dominion which failed to carry out its share &quot;of theAgreement should contain discretionary power to the treasury to waive the imposition of tho ad valorem duty if necessary.       Section 4(,5) of the Import Duties Act.          Parliamentary Counsel should he ashed whether theAct gives power to the Treasury to vary from time to timeOrders made under this section.  If not, it would seem desirable to take such, power in the new Bill.,
ANNEX III       OTTAWA LEGISLATION CONFERENCE.         2nd Meeting. September 1st.   Sir Warren Fisher (in the Chair)   Mr. Phillips and Mr. Waterfield (Treasury)   Sir Horace Hamilton, Sir Henry Fountain and Mr. Browett                                   (Board of Trade)   Sir Edward Forber (Customs)   Mr. Whiskard (Dominions Office)   Mr, French and Mr. Dale (Ministry of Agriculture)   Mr. Granville Ram (Parliamentary Counsel).          Mr. V/hiskard raised the question whether airy time limit should be imposed in the Bill.   In his opinion theintention of the Agreements was that they should continue indefinitely subject to the right of denunciation after an initial period.          It was agreed that a matter of policy was involved,viz.  whether at the end of the initial period(s) theExecutive should be at liberty to continue the Agreements orwhether express Parliamentary authority should be sought.,Continuation would of course be subject implicitly to theapproval of Parliament but there was a difference of principle between implicit approval and explicit statutory sanctionAfter some discussion it was agreed that the Bill should be drafted without any limiting date, but that the attention ofMinisters should be drawn to the point.          It was agreed that the Bill should itself impose thevarious, duties in accordance with the Agreements, and that theduties should be set out in a Schedule to the Bill.   this/as necessary, since the definitions in some of the agreements were loosely worded and would require  -redrafting, subject of
                                                            .  209       course  to the intention of the  Agreements  being left       unchange d.                 The Bill should empower the  Treasury to make       Orders  (a)  respecting the date  from which the duties       should come into force arid (h)  revoking or suspending       the Agreements if all the Dominions concerned should       denounce  the Agreements or defaults thereon.                 It was agreed, that any duty  common to two or       more Agreements must continue in force so long as any       one of the Dominions concerned adhere! to the Agreement       imposing it.   If in such a case one or more other       Dominions defaulted or denounced the Agreement, they  would       he liable to have this particular duty charged on their       exports to the United Kingdom^    Power must he given  to       the Treasury hy Order in such cases to cancel free entry       from the defaulting Dominion(s).                The special position of the Irish Free State       was considered.   If a separate Agreement were made       between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State,  a       separate Bill would he required; but conceivably it might       be desired to give the Irish Free State the benefit of       the proposed new duties imposed in the Ottawa Bill without       any special agreement;  and it was suggested that power       should be taken under the Ottawa Bill  to do this.   (Power       already exists under the Import Duties Act to give the       Irish Free State the benefit of the duties under that Act       if desired).A,              It was agreed that, if no time limit is imposed       in the Act, no special legislation v/as required for dealing       with Schedule A.
                                                             300Xst              Mr.  Ram advised that there -was&apos; full power &quot;Tinder         Sc19(5)  of the Import Duties Act to vary and&apos;renew as well         as to revoke Orders made under the manufactured                 The  Conference then reviewed the notes and con-         elusions of  the previous Meeting. L,              It was agreed that, subject to the approval of the         House authorities, it was preferable to submit a single         Resolution,  providing for expiry in the case of each         country  on the date of termination of the Agreement with         that country.                 Parliamentary Counsel undertook to consider whether,         supposing that a duty were rescinded in consequence of the         default  of a Dominion, and the Dominion were subsequently         to renew the Agreement,  it would be possible to re impose the         duty without a fresh Resolution, s(i).            It was pointed out that &quot;flat white maize&quot; must         be added to  the list,back             The  words  &quot;copper and&quot; should be inserted before         &quot;linseed&quot;.                 Mr.  Waterfield undertook to consult the Home Office,e  of     regarding the  Isle of Man and N.  Ireland,  both of which         would be affected by any scheme for the  restriction of meat         imports.table.            In last line of paragraph insert &quot;another&quot; before         &quot;for&quot;.                 As regards date  of publication,  it was agreed that         it was essential to publish all the Agreements in full in&apos; a
     White Paper  a few days before Parliament meets.  Simultaneous     publication  by  all  concerned v/as  clearly desirable;   but     if  et g. , Canada insisted  on legislating earlier, and  the     Canadian Agreement  were published in Canada say  in mid-     September, simultaneous publication of  that Agreement would     be  necessary on this  side also.     partial publication, how-     eve r, should be avoided if possible.,          The Dominions  Office undertook to draft a telegram     to  the  Dominions proposing this procedure  and asking what     their plans  for ratification were.te         It was  agreed  that it was preferable  that the Billtion.     should  provide  for  the duties to  take effect as  from  the     date when the Bill  becomes law, with power to the Treasury     to  postpone  if  necessary.     But the procedure  must  depend     to  some extent  on the replies received to  the Dominions     Office  telegram.    Postponement  would not be likely  to he     needed  except in the  case of India.          No regulations would he needed.          MR. RAM pointed  out  that this would prevent the     Bill from being certified as a Money Bill, but it was agreed     that this did. not matter.21o        SIR WARREN FISHER said that  he had already  written     to  the  Chancellor of  the  Exchequer.          It was  agreed  that,  if the Russian Treaty had     alreads/ been denounced, the Bill  could contain a saving for     &quot;all existing treaties&quot;.          SIR Ec  FORBER  pointed out that if prohibition were     enforced, certificates of origin  would be  required,
302     If no time limit is included in the Bill, no special!, provision on this account is required.     As under Art.22.     But it was pointed out that the Treasury&apos;o general powers must include a power to reduce a duty  (by Agreementwith the Dominion) as well as to revoke.     LIE. FRENCH raised the question whether power could also he given to vary the definition of articles coveredby a duty so as to conform with any changes whichadministrative experience might suggest to be necessary.It was agreed however that, while there would be noobjection to removing certain articles altogether from the class covered by the definition, it would be impossibleto give the Executive power to vary the statutory definitionso as to impose a duty on articles not previously dutiable.Any such change must he reserved for the annual finance bill.

9 n oMR. W ATERFIELD.         Conference on legislation to implement             the Ottawa agcreeuejnts.   lc  I have &quot;been considering, in relation to the calendar, the time-table which was discussed at yesterday&apos;smeeting of this conference.      We assumed then that thedate of re-assembly of parliament-would be advanced from october 27th to October 2&quot;0th,    This would mean that parliament would re-assemble on a Thursday.   Thursday, the27th, was originally fixed, because it was int ended to  takeonly formal business before proroguing with a view to theState opening of Parliament on November 1st, but aThursday is obviously a very inconvenient day for Parliamentto meet for the transaction of actual &quot;business.   I suggestthat the most convenient course would be to summonParliament for Monday, the 17th October, and to arrange the  Programme as follows s-Mon. and Tues.        Committee Stage of resolutions forOct. 17th and 18th.      the Bill,Thurso Oct. 20th*     Report Stage of resolutions for the                         Bi 11 oMon. Oct. 24th.       Guillotine motion.Tues. and &quot;Wed.        Second Reading of the Bill.Octo85th and 26th.Pri. Oct. 28th.Mon., OcV Slsto      )Committee Stage of Bill,Tuesc Wed. and Thurs.Nov. 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd.Mon. and Tues.        Report and Third Reading of Bill.Nov. 7th and 8th.     This  arrangement would allow  sufficient time for members to read the Bill before the Second Reading andwould also allow an interval of one day for the putting
394down  of  amendments between the Second. Reading and Committee,and an interval  of another day (which would be a Friday)for a similar pixrpose between Committee and Report Stages,   2o  It will be observed that the programme suggestedin  the last preceding paragraph of this minute makes no provision for any resolutions under s.4(2) of the ImportDuties Act, 1932.    If it is ultimately decided thatthere is a necessity for  such resolutions, they could betaken on Wednesday the 19th, Friday the 21st, Thursday the27th  October, or Friday the 4th November, or indeed, on anyday between the  8th and 15th November, but for the reasons.given below, I think it may be unnecessary to pass anyresolutions under s.4(2), and in that case, the daysmentioned can no doubt profitably be used for other purposes.   So  The reasons for which I think the resolutionsunder s. 4( 2) of  the Import Duties Act, 1952,  may be unnecessary are  as follows s-      It will be  essential for the Bill to contain aprovision for extending to the countries which have mads&quot;Ottawa  agreements&quot; an exemption from the new duties tobe imposed by the Bill similar to that given by s,4(2)  ofthe Import Duties Act.     This cannot  be done by an order under sn4(2), for such orders can relate only to duties imposed under the Import Duties Act and not to duties imposed by the BillU    This being so,  it would,  I think-, be best  to  draft the provision in the Bill so as to extend notonly  to  the new  duties to be imposed by the Bill, but alsoto the general ad valorem duty and any additional dutyimposed by or under the  Import Duties  Act,  1932,    If theBill  is drafted  in this way and becomes law by tho  15thNovember, there will,  of course, be no necessity for anyorders under s.4 of the Act of 19 32 at all.                         - *3 o-
     Under the programme suggested above,  however,  itis very doubtful whether the Bill (which will not be a&quot;money Bill&quot; within the meaning of the Parliament Act5 1911)can be passed by the Kor.se of Lords before November 15th.That House&apos; could not receive the Bill until late on the night of Tuesday, November Gth, and I imagine, therefore,that Their Lordnhips would be extremely reluctant to pass the Bill through all its stages before the 15th,   If thisproves to be the case, it seems to me that the situation could be met by the making of a Treasury order under s.4(3)of the Import Buties Act, 1932, providing for the necessaryexemption till a date late enough to allow the Royal assent to the Bill to be given.    Any possible objection to thiscourse based on the ground that s04(2) makes expressprovision for a resolution of the House of Commons, could have little cogency in view of the fact that the Billgranting the same exemption will already have been passedby that House before the Treasury order under s,. 4(3)is made.
