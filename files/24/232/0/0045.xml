Q95 (32)                                       COPY NO.                          CABINET.   The Regulation of Meat Imports  In relation to  the International                 Obligations of the United  Kingdom.         Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.      The *agreed programme&quot; for the limitation of imports of frozen mutton and lamb and frozen and chilled beef  into the United Kingdom from foreign countries which  forms part of the agreements made at Ottawa with the Australian and New Zealand Governments raises the question of our pre-existing international obligations.   I hope  it  may be possible  for  the actual machinery of control to be manipulated by the meat companies  themselves. and I  propose shortly to call  a conference of the meat interests with a view to considering TH8 problem.    Such a voluntary system of control will,  however,  only be possible if the Government have powers in reserve and are ready to  exercise  them if necessary for the direct regulation of imports  of the meats in question.     There are,  of course,  no  imports of such meats from the Continent of Europe so that a  restriction  of this kind would not affect the obligation we have  undertaken vis-a-vis  the German Government by the Anglo-German Commercial  Treaty of 1924 VaHtf&quot; &apos; &quot; the Protocol  annexed  to  that Treaty) to  impose no additional prohibitions  or restrictions,  subject to certain exceptions, on the importation of  German goods,  A difficulty however,  arises from the  existence  of  the  International Convention for the Abolition of Import and Export  Prohibitions which was also designed to keep
                                                        o r; iwithin narrow limits this method of regulating imports  asbetween the parties, coupled with the fact that certain otheroountriee are entitled to mo at-favoured-nation treatment inthe matter.  Among the parties to this Convention is the UnitedStates of America which is in fact an exporter to this  country of a small quantity of frozen beef and a much smaller quantityof frozen lamb.   The actual quantities Imported in 1930 and1931 (the last year for which full details are available atpresent) from the United States of America and from all foreigncountries were as follows:-	Prom the U..S.A.		From all Foreign countries.		1930.	1931.	1930.	1931,	1,000 cwts. 36 2	1,000 cwts. 46 2	1,000 owts. 665 1,216	1,000 cwts. 653 1,249								     On the faoe of it we would seem to be precluded by theInternational Convention from any prohibition or restriction ofUnited States supplies, whilst the Argentine and Chile areentitled to most-favoured-nation treatment so that imports fromthese countries have to be treated on the sans basis as importsfrom the United States of America.     There are, however, no less than four possible ways in whichtreaty difficulties might conceivably be overcome:     (1) In the first place there is in the international convention as in the Anglo-German Treaty a provision which    )permits of the imposition of prohibitions and restrictions wherethere is a simultaneous control of the production of, of trade intsimilar domestic products.  If, therefore, it were possible toshow that the output of mutton and beef at home were controlled,all difficulties would disappear.  I understand that some controlof the home output is, in fact, in contemplation, but that effective control is not an immediate possibility.  If that be.so this particular method fails.
     (2) A second method of overcoming treaty difficultiesis to impose no actual prohibitions but to limit the  quanti-ties which may be imported free of duty, further quantitiesbeing subject to a duty of a prohibitive character.   Thisoourse has actually been followed by some European countries,limited quotas of certain forms of produce being admittedat a normal rate of duty whilst quantities in excess  of  the quota are subject to a much higher duty.  A duty actuallyprovided for by statute, however, which would moreover haveto be one of some considerable magnitude,  would inevitablyin public estimation be regarded as a duty  on imported  meat,even though, in fact, no imported meat was ever actuallysubjected to it.  I cannot, therefore, recommend the  adoptionof this oourse.     (3) A third method would be to recognise the right  ofthe United States to send us meat without practical restric-tion, but to deal with the difficulty of the right of othercountries to most-favoured-nation treatment by the use of  ageneral formula which in form at least would apply similarlyto all countries of  supply, although in fact it did not  sooperate.  It would be possible, for example, to lay down thatany country  supplying meat should be entitled to send useither a fixed quantity or a certain proportion of theamount she sent in 1931 whichever was the larger.  The fixedquantity could be so arranged as to let In as much or moremeat from the United States of America as they would  belikely to send us, and the alternative proportion, whichwould in fact operate in the case of the major meat  exporting countries, oould be  adjusted accordingly,  There is  a certainplausibility In this method which depends upon the obviousdifficulty of saying exactly what most-favoured-nation                               -3-
treatment means, where restriction by quota is concerned.Thus Germany has taken the view that having agreed witha particular country to admit a fixed quantity of someproduce or other she satisfies her most-favoured-nationobligations to other countries by guaranteeing identicalquotas to them even though they have hitherto normallysent quantities vastly exceeding those sent by thecountry first concerned.  On the other hand Prance Inadministering quotas has generally taken the alternativeview that quotas allotted to particular countries shouldbe proportionate to the quantities-received from-thosecountries In a standards year or years.  It will be observed that a formula on the lines above suggested Isa combination of these two rival views.  Plausible,however, as it may be it is perhaps open to the criticism ofbeing too Ingenious and I should hesitate to adopt itunless no better method could be found.     (4)  Finally there is one method which has at least the merit of simplicity for it commits us to no specificaction, but merely to a line of defence if our action inrestricting imports of meat is challenged by the UnitedStates.  The International Convention in fact, contains a clause (to which there is nothing corresponding in the ^Anglo-German Commercial Treaty) which provides as follows:**     &quot;Nothing In this Convention shall affect the rightof any high contracting party to adopt measuresprohibiting or restricting Importation or exportation forthe purpose of protecting In extraordinary and abnormalcircumstances the vital interests of the country&quot;.
     The clause further provides that the restrictions in question must in such event he applied in a non-discriminatory manner and concludes &quot;Their duration shall herestricted to that of the causes or circumstances from whichthey arise.&quot;     The Netherlands Government, who though parties to theInternational Convention have adopted certain forms of restriction, have in fact already prayed this clause in aid,and the restrictions imposed in Denmark (which is also a party to the Convention) would no doubt be defended on similar lines.  It maybe said that in our agreement with australia we have contemplated a continuing policy of replacing foreign by Empire supplies and that such a continuing policy is not consistent with the plea thatabnormal circumstances of presumably restricted durationjustify the restriction.  The actual &quot;agreed programme&quot; itself is, however, one for 18 months only and is introduced, touse the language of the Declaration, by the United KingdomGovernment because &quot;The -present wholesale prices of frozenmeat are at a level which has resulted in grave depressionin the livestock industries of the United Kingdom and theDominions&quot;.  It seems to me, therefore, that for the present at least, and especially if we avoid emphasising too much the&quot;long term policy&quot; view of this portion at least of the ottawa agreements, we can fairly argue that the circumstancesenvisaged in the above quoted clause of the International^Convention have arisen and that we are relieved to that extent of its obligations.     I would, therefore, recommend to the consideration ofmy colleagues that we should rely on this fourth method ofjustifying the action we are now committed to take.  It
       seems to me that a plea of this sort is one on which it      i       would he difficult, if not impossible, for the United States       Government to take us to the Hague Tribunal with any       prospect of success, the question, the question       what constitute the &quot;vital interests&quot; of a country being       apparently left by the Convention to the decision of the       country concerned.           I should add that the difficulty of maintaining this       view consistently for a period of years is such that we shall       probably have to consider withdrawing from the International       Convention when the next time comes for doing so, i.e. on or       before June 30th, 1933.                                              W.R.fd of Trade,1st  September, 1932.
