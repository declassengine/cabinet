NEW   INDUSTRIAL  DEVELOPMENT.REPORT.                        INTRODUCTORY.    WE held a preliminary meeting on the 28rd April,  1981,  for the purpose of discussing the scope of our inquiry, and the method  by which it should he conducted.    2.  As regards the former, we agreed to treat our  investigations as being  directed  towards ascertaining  to  what extent  the  field embraced in our terms of reference was already covered, what gaps, if any, existed, and whether  there was  any overlapping that could usefully be obviated by further co-ordination or gaps  that could  be filled either  by the  development  of existing  organisations or  by the creation ad  hoc of  some new  body.   We decided, therefore, in the first instance,  to  inform ourselves regarding the  nature and  extent of the existing provision for bringing the  results of scientific research to  the  attention of  industry  and for their application by industry through Government or State-aided institutions, University organisa- tions, co-operative  research organisations  established  by particular industries  and private research organisations of individual industrial concerns.    8.  At the same time, we agreed to obtain information regarding the industrial research  organisations established in the  United States of America (e.g.,  the Mellon Institute, and the Washington Bureau of Standards) and  in Germany.    4.   We began  the hearing of oral evidence on the 14th May, 1981, our first witness being Sir P. E. Smith, the Secretary of the Depart- ment of Scientific and Industrial Research,  who  gave  us a general description of the  work of that  Department.  At our next meeting, we received  evidence from the  Advisory  Council  for Scientific and Industrial  Research,  who  had appointed Lord  Rutherford, theirChairman, Sir William  Larke,  and Mr. Kenneth Lee to  put before  us their views on  the proposals outlined in our terms  of reference.  Our next  meeting  was   held  at   the  National  Physical  Laboratory, Teddington,  where we  received evidence  from the representatives  of.the Executive  Committee of  the National  Physical Laboratory and were given an opportunity of  seeing for  ourselves some of  the work there being carried out.    5.   The  next  series of meetings was devoted  to the taking  of evidence in regard to the work of the research associations established by particular  industries.   Among the  witnesses  who  gave such evidence  were representatives or officials of  the Wool Industries Research Association, the British Boot and Shoe  and Allied  Trades Research Association and of the British Scientific Instrument Research Association.  In addition, we received evidence from Mr.  Kenneth Lee in regard to the application of research in  the cotton industry.    6.   We concluded the taking of oral evidence at a meeting attended by Mr. A.  P.  M. Fleming,  of  Metropolitan-Vickers  Electrical Company,  Ltd., who had been one of the foremost  advocates of the establishment of  a  new  national research organisation of  the type outlined in our terms of reference.    7.   A full list  of the witnesses who appeared before us is given  in Appendix 1 to this Report.    8.   In addition,  we received a large amount of written evidence, mainly  in regard to the work of other industrial research associations,some particulars in  regard to  which we  give in Appendix 2 to this Report.    9.   Throughout  our inquiry,  we  received  all possible assistance from the Government Departments whom we consulted.  Of these, the foremost was the  Department  of  Scientific  and Industrial Research, who gave us  valuable information in regard  to many points connected with our inquiry.  On particular questions also we received assistance
from the Board of Trade,  the Government Chemist and the empire marketing Board.&apos;   10.   We desire to place on record our indebtedness to all  whoassisted  us in  our inquiry, whether by giving  oral evidence,  or byfurnishing memoranda.    I THE EXISTING  ORGANISATION  OF  INDUSTRIAL               RESEARCH IN  GREAT  BRITAIN.  *a) The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and its  -                      research establishments.    (i) The functions of the Department of Scientific and Industrial                            Research.    11.   Before examining the merits of the proposal submitted to us,we  think it essential to survey the existing  organisation for promoting the application of science to industry.    12.   The existing Government organisation is administered by theDepartment  of  Scientific  and   Industrial   Research,  which  was established in 1916.   The Department  works under the authority of aCommittee of the Privy Council established in 1915, which is preside over by the Lord President of the  Council,  acting on the advice of an advisory Council of persons chosen for their scientific or scientific andindustrial  qualifications.   In practice  this  Advisory  Council  hascommanded, since its inception,  the services of men  of the highest-distinction.  In the direction of research work undertaken  in variousfields the Department has had the  assistance of a considerable numberof research boards and committees,  composed of persons eminent inscience and in the particular branch or branches of industry concerned.At the head of  the staff of the Department  are men who combine  in a remarkable degree scientific attainments, administrative ability, zeal,persuasiveness  and sympathetic understanding of the point of view ofbusiness men.  Largely owing to these fortunate personal factors, tho.prestige  of the still young Department of Scientific  and  industrial research has grown steadily and  rapidly,  and stands  high  to-day in both the scientific and industrial worlds.    18.   The work which has grown  up under the auspices of theDepartment is of various kinds.  In the first place there are a numberof permanent establishments for research in different fields maintaineddirectly by the Department.  Secondly,  the Department has establishedfrom time to time temporary organisations  to  deal with  particular problems requiring the  application  of modern  science to industrialrequirements.   Thirdly,  the Department  stimulates  industries toundertake  research   by  promoting  the  formation of  autonomousresearch  associations.(ii)  Permanent research establishments maintained by the Department                of Scientific and Industrial Research.(a)  The National Physical Laboratory.    14.   The most important of the permanent research establishmentsis the National  Physical Laboratory.  The Laboratory was founded in1901  as  a public  institution   for  standardising  and   verifyinginstruments, for  testing materials, and  for the  determination of physical  constants.  Its establishment sprang from the representations of a committee  of the  British Association which called attention  to theadvantages which German industry had derived from the Reichsanstaltin Berlin.   As  the result of these representations the Royal Societywere invited by  the Government to organise a similar institution in thiscountry,  and to  nominate  a governing body on which commercial interests should be represented.  A small grant in aid was paid by theState, but responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory and forits finances rested with the Royal Society until 1918, when an agree-ment was made to transfer this responsibility to the Department of scientific and Industrial  Research.  The work  of the Laboratory isstill,  however,  supervised  by an  Executive  Committee,  all  themeinberB of  which are appointed by  the  Royal  Society,  the Lord
President accepting this committee as a committee of the Departmentof Scientific and  Industrial Research.   The  Committee  makes  anannual report to the Department which is reviewed by the AdvisoryCouncil.,  and its annual estimates and scheme of work are referred  tothe Advisory  Council  before  submission to the Lord President forapproval.    15.   Since the  foundation of  the  Laboratory  the  ExecutiveCommittee have made it  their aim to develop in  every  way open  tothem the application of science to industry.  They have always taken a broad  view of  their duties and  the work  of the Laboratory has accordingly steadily expanded  and covers to-day a very wide range of activities.   The Laboratory, which is situated at Teddington, com-prises  at  the  present  time  departments  for physics,  electricity,metrology,  engineering,  aeronautics  and  metallurgy,  as  well   asmaintaining the William Fronde laboratory for shipbuilding  researchwhich was established  with the  aid of a gift from the late Sir AlfredYarrow.   In these various departments the work  that is being donefalls under two broad  heads.  In the  first  place the Laboratoryperforms work not only for the Department of Scientific and industrial research and other Government Departments (e.j/., the Air Ministry),but also  for the benefit  of particular  industrial firms or industrial research  associations or private persons, such as the testing of instru-ments and materials, or the pursuit of special researches, for which afee  is charged.   In  the  second  place,  the Laboratory  pursuesfundamental research work on its own initiative.  In this  it has theassistance of committees on which  eminent scientific knowledge andindustrial experience  are  represented,  and of a research  committee-consisting  of  five members of the Royal  Society,  with  Sir J.  J.Thomson  as  chairman,  which deals  with  researches  designed  topromote  &quot;the advancement of natural knowledge.&quot;   .16.   A full account of the research work undertaken at Teddingtonis given in the report of the Laboratory, which is published annually.The range of  the  work is so wide that it would be difficult to  give a brief  summary of the results that have  been achieved,  or of thebenefits which have been conferred thereby on British industry.  we regard it  as unnecessary for the purposes of our Report to attempt sucha summary, since there  is no dispute as to the  efficiency of theLaboratory or the high  value of the  work which  it  is  doing.   Weconfine  ourselves, therefore,  to recording our conviction  that theNational  Physical  Laboratory compares favourably  with any similarinstitution in the world. . We were  greatly impressed and encouraged by what we saw when we visited Teddington.  Nothing could be morereassuring than the spirit of  unostentatious zeal  which inspires thedirection of the Laboratory.  Those  of us who have visited similarinstitutions in other countries were particularly struck by the absencein the National Physical  Laboratory  of anything in the nature  ofshowy schemes of dubious value.  It was manifest that the work of theLaboratory had grown up as an organic structure in response to clearly defined needs and purposes, and that nothing owed its existence to thedesire to impress.  The National Physical Laboiratory is an institution of which Great Britain has good reason to be proud, and so far as thefield of industrial research covered by its activities is concerned we are convinced that there is no justification for any misgivings of our being less well equipped  than any other country.(b)  Other research establishments.   17.  In addition to the National Physical Laboratory,  the followingstations are maintained by  the Department of Scientific and industrial research at the sole cost of the State :    The Fuel Research  Station (Greenwich).   The Buildi ng Research  Station (Watford).   The Laboratories of the Food Investigation Board (Cambridge, East      Mailing, Torry).   Tho Forest Products Research Station (Princes  Risborough).   The Geological Survey and Museum of Practical Geology (London).   The Radio Research Station  (Slough).   The Chemical Research Laboratory (Teddington).
     18.   A number of other specific  fields of investigations are being  explored by  means of boards  or  committees of the Department and  financed wholly or in  part from its Vote.  The most important of these  is research on.water  pollution. It will be observed that the majority of industries whose products are of special importance from the stand-  point of the community as a whole are covered by the above list.  Food. fuel,  buildings and a  clean water-supply are among the primary needs of man.  and the general public, as well  as  the industries  concerned, has an interest in securing that these needs are supplied in  the most -efficient manner which scientific investigation can render possible.   It is largely  for this  reason  that  the Department  of  Scientific  and Industrial Research has assumed direct responsibility for these fields of industrial research.   The research stations  maintain, however, close contact with the industries concerned, and  many  valuable results  in these fields have accrued from the  collaboration of industry and the scientific workers in these stations.      (Hi) Temporary  research organisations of the Department  of                 Scientific and Industrial Research.    19.   As examples of temporary research organisations  created by the Department ad hoc to investigate particular problems,  we may instance  the  Bridge Stress Research  Committee, the Steel  Structures Research Committee,  and the Locomotive Experimental Station Inquiry Committee.   The first of these completed its task some time ago.  Its appointment  was the  result of a  movement organised by the Depart- mentin response to a recognised need  in which the cordial co-operation, financial and technical,  of the railway  companies  was successfully enlisted in a  scientific revision of the principles which should govern the construction of railway  bridges.   It is interesting to observe that one of its most useful  results was to demonstrate the need for modifica- tion of practice in locomotive design.   Its work  has taken effect in the building both of bridges and of locomotives.    20.  The Steel Structures Research Committee  is still in the early -stages of its work.  This Committee  owes its inception to the pioneer work  of the Building Research Station which led  to an  offer by the British Steelwork Association of  a subscription of  . 2,000  a  year for five years towards carrying out a programme of research in the applica- tion of modern scientific  knowledge to the construction of steel framed buildings.  The work of this  Committee is confidently expected to result in modifications  of   certain requirements  which  are at  present  a hindrance to  technical advance and more economical methods of con- struction.   We understand, indeed, that the preliminary work  of the Committee has already been accepted by  the London County Council as a basis for its control  of steel construction  in the area  for which  it is responsible.    21.  Our  last example  is the Locomotive  Experimental Station Inquiry Committee, appointed in 1928, on which scientists,  practising engineers, the  chief  mechanical  engineers  of the railway companies and  representatives   of  the  locomotive  builders co-operated  in an inquiry on the need for research into the design  of railway locomotives and the provision  of  facilities  for tests of their performance.   The Committee made a- comprehensive review of  the problem  and evolved a scheme for a full-scale testing station for the study of the locomotive. The arrangements for carrying this  scheme into effect have not yet been settled.    22.  For the purposes of  our inquiry, these temporary organisations are of considerable interest as indicating  the flexibility of the system administered  by the Department of Scientific and Industrial  Research. They show that, when the need for scientific investigation  makes itself felt &quot;in anv field of industry  not  adequately  covered by  any  existing research establishment, the Department is able and ready to improvise a special  organisation adapted  to the circumstances of the  particular case.    (b) Research associations established  by particular industries.    28.  While maintaining  the research  establishments of  which an-account has already been  given, most of which it  has itself established,
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research  haB proceededalong different  lines in its efforts to foster the  continuous  prosecution of research in the ordinary industrial field.  It  has sought  to persuadeindustries to form research associations under a scheme devised by th&amp;Advisory Council of the  Department.  A research association formed.under  this scheme  is an organisation set up by  the industry for the.industry.   It appoints its own staff,  decides its own policy  as to themanner in which  research should be carried  out  (e.g.,  whether tomaintain its.own laboratory or to make use of outside scientific institu-tions).  It draws up its programme of research and  settles the way in&apos;which  the results of research are to be utilised by its members.  Thegreat majority  of the research associations receive grants  in aid fromthe Department of Scientific  and Industrial Research  and  as a con-dition of these grants they are required to satisfy the Department that,there is  &quot;due prosecution of research.&quot;  Their  annual programmes and estimates come under the  review  of the Advisory Council, who can make suggestions,  but the greatest possible freedom is given to thegoverning bodies of research associations to conduct their business intheir own way.   24.   The principle  on which the grants-in-aid to the research associations are determined is as follows:  there  is a  &quot;datum line&quot;representing  the minimum sum of money which must be raised by the-particular  industry  before any assistance will be given.   For every.pound raised by the industry  in excess of this minimum amount, theDepartment contributes a pound, until a certain maximum is reached,beyond which no further grant is paid. The &quot; datum line &quot; varies from industry to industry and is changed from time  to time  with  the objectof securing that the associations will eventually  become self-supporting.   25.  The idea of the research association scheme is,  in short,  to persuade industries to create their own organisations for research on aco-operative  basis.   The  Department  of  Scientific  and  industrial research renders  limited financial aid  in the  early stages,  places itsexperience and knowledge at the disposal of the associations, and mam-tains at all times close contact with them.   26.  A large number of research associations  have  been formed:under this scheme,  and  altogether their membership comprises some4,800  different firms. The following are at present in receipt of aid :-    British Scientific Instrument Research Association : London.   Wool Industries Research  Association : Leeds.    British  Boot,   Shoe  and  Allied  Trades  Research   Association :       London.    British Cotton Industry Research  Association: Didsbury,  Man-      - Chester.    Linen Industry Research Association : Lambeg,  Belfast.    Research Association of British Rubber Manufacturers :  Croydon.    British Association of Research for  Cocoa, Chocolate, Sugar Con-       fectionery and Jam Trades : London.    British Non-Ferrous  Metals Research  Association :  London and       other centres.    British Refractories Research Association :  Stoke.    British Launderers&apos; Research Association : Hendon.    British Leather Manufacturers&apos; Research Association : London.     British Cutlery  Research  Association : Sheffield.    British Electrical and Allied Industries  Research  Association r       London.    British Silk Research Association : Leeds.    British Cast Iron Research Association : Birmingham.    Research Association of British Flour Millers : St.  Albans, Herts.    British Food Manufacturers&apos; Research Association : London.    Research Association of British Paint,  Colour and Varnish Manu-       facturers :  Teddington.    National Federation of Iron and Steel  Manufacturers  (Industrial       Research Council) : Different  centres.    Institution  of Automobile Engineers (Research and  standardisation       tion Committee) : Chiswick.
    27.   In addition,  tho following  research  associations  have beenformed and are operating without State subvention :     Scottish Shale Oil Scientific and  Industrial Research Association :       Glasgow.    British Colliery  Owners&apos;  Research Association :  Aid  to  different       institutions.    Printing Industry Research Association : London : Bureau activities      only at present.    28.   The  scheme  of research associations  was  adopted  by  theAdvisory Council of  the Department  of  Scientific and  industrial research after a careful consideration of the alternative courses that were open to them.  They deliberately rejected the idea of forming one central institution to which  industries could  turn  for the  purpose ofcarrying out researches into their problems.    They  did so on  theground that the progress of industrial research would,&quot;in the long run,be best  promoted  by measures which enlisted the  active co-operationof industrialists.  The progress  of  the research associations formedunder the scheme goes far,  we think, to confirm the wisdom of thisdecision.  The associations enumerated in  the list given above varygrdatly, of course,  in the strength and solidity of the position they have established, in the degree of backing they command from the industries concerned, and  in the value of the results they have achieved.  Butspeaking generally,  the research  association movement has not onlyled to  discoveries  of great financial  importance, but has achieved a remarkable  success  in  converting  British  manufacturers from  an attitude of scepticism and, even in some cases, of hostility, to an appre-ciation of the potentialities of scientific investigation.  The progress of scientific research  in industry is intimately bound up with the develop-ment, by industrialists and  scientific workers,  of a mutual under-standing of each other&apos;s problems and each other&apos;s  language.   As itwas put to us in evidence by  Sir William Larke        &apos;&apos; I have visited  fifteen out of the nineteen existing  research.    associations  during  my   period   as  chairman  of the  Industrial    Grants Committee  [of  the Advisory Council  for  Scientific and    Industrial  Research], some of them more  than once,  and I have    attended their meetings,  their banquets,  and so on,  and talked to    them, and I have always made  this point,  that it  is useless  the    scientist obtaining results which  would be of service  in  industry    unless he  can  translate them  into a language which the  operator    in industry can understand, and thus be able to take advantage of    the research and apply  it.....I realise the  difficulties  of    the director of research the scientist.  He often  has a great diffi-    culty in getting the industrialist management, which is  not always    highly educated  scientifically, to appreciate the  advantages  of    making changes, sometimes  substantial  changes, in practice;  or    the necessity for training personnel in slightly new operations, and    that  sort of thing,  but we are getting over that, and  the longer    these research  associations   exist as  they are,  controlled  by    committees of  industrialists, committees on which are represented    what I would call the practical producing  side, the  personnel  are    becoming educated, and I should say, in my five years&apos; experience,    the development  of the  application of the results  of  research  to    industry has shown really remarkable progress.&quot;    29.   A research  association which a particular industry controls,for which it feels responsible and in which it takes a pride, is able tocontribute to the development of this mutual  understanding betweenscientists and industrialists in a way that would not be open to a centralinstitution.  This may be illustrated by the  following extract from theevidence given to us by Sir F. E.  Smith,  the Secretary of the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial  Research :        &quot;. .  .  .  The  Cotton  Research  Association  which  is  near    Manchester one feels it  should be, of  course, in the Lancashire    district is an  organisation which is spending . 60,000 to   70,000    per annum.  It has a large research institute and a  large number    of scientific and technical people  attached to it  help the industry.    The first thing, which I  think is  of very great  importance, is the   large  number of inquiries. I regard it as being an  exceedingly good    [7059]                               -                   clllllllllllllll IIIIIIIIIHIIMIIIHHIIMI
   sign that a complaint was made that half the staff were absent from   the laboratory;  that there was such  a  demand  from individual   firms for help that half the staff were always in the works.  The   Director of Research has stated that the number of inquiries from   the constituent  firms  in one year amounted to  over  4,000,  an   average of 12 per day.   I give this as an example to show the   intimate touch there is between some of these research associations   and the  constituent  firms.   One is  really  helping industry   tremendously, if you  can get the confidence,  the faith, of the   individual firms to put their problems  frankly in front of you and   say :  &apos; This may not be research, but we  are in trouble, help us   out.&apos;  One really has  to take the  broadest, view of these matters.   Sometimes, I admit, the troubles are not research problems at all,   but, nevertheless, one feels that these research associations have   got to help the people and get their confidence, and confidence has   undoubtedly been obtained in that  fashion.&quot;   30.  Perhaps the most useful result achieved  by research associa-tions is the stimulus they have given to the habit of applying scientificmethods in the  control of industrial operations.  Everywhere  to-day the scientific  method is being substituted  for  the rule of thumb, and much closer control of treatment and uniformity of output are securedthereby.  In addition to this educational  function, many research associations have already achieved concrete results of proved  value.It is difficult, of course,  to assess, in monetary terms, the benefits which have thereby accrued to industry.  But  it is possible  to give oneor two examples showing that research work has led to ascertainedeconomies which, in some cases, have more than off-set the expenditure incurred by the research  association  since its inception.    Exampleswere  given bx  the late  Mr.  Einile  Garcke in the course  of- hispresidential address to the Electrical Research  Association in  1929.He pointed out that the researches carried out by the Association oninsulating  oils had cost about  8,500 in all, but had resulted in a saving to the industry of at least  100,000 per annum.  The researcheson buried  cables had cost the  Association  up  to that   date  about 18,500, but had  represented a  saving to the industry of at least a quarter of a million pounds per annum, and had added something likefour millions to the value of the existing cables.  The researches onoverhead transmission lines had led to reductions in cost estimated at 800,000 per annum.   Similarly, the results of researches on nozzlesfor steam turbines  would, if reckoned in  terms of saving in fuel eon-sumption, represent a saving of  140,000 per annum.    31.  An  example of a different kind  is the  improvement  in  the behaviour  of  &quot;saggars,&quot;   for  which   the  Refractories ResearchAssociation is responsible.   Saggars are the fire-clay containers inwhich most classes of pottery and porcelain are placed to protect them from the direct effect of the fire. As the result  of suggestions madeby the Research Association, one manufacturer has declared that the life of saggars used in his works has been increased from about 7 toover 200 firings, and that, in consequence, his Saggar Department hadtemporarily to suspend its operations.  As it  is estimated  that at thepresent time about  200,000 per year is spent in the replacement ofsaggars, the  economies  which  will  be  achieved  by means of this improvement are obviously very substantial.    32.  It is pertinent to observe, in  view of the  allusion in our termsof reference  to  &quot;tests  on an industrial  scale,&quot;  that many research associations have taken special pains to carry their researches to thepoint  of  practical  application,  and  with  this  end  in  view  have established departments devoted entirely  to development  work.  this branch of their operations  is of growing  importance owing  to thedifficulty  under present  conditions of persuading industry to showpractical   interest  in  new  methods  entailing  additional  capitalexpenditure.  We quote in this  connection an extract from a  memo-randum furnished to us  by the British Cotton Industry Research Association :        &quot;.  .  . .  It has all along been recognised  by the Council Of the    Cotton Research Association that results obtained in the laboratory -   cannot be of value unless and until they  are applied  in mills and    works  in the industry.   The problem of providing  a bridge by
   means of which research results can be &quot; got over &quot;to the trade   is one which has caused a great deal of anxious thought.  Three   methods have been adopted, all of which it is hoped will contribute   towards  solving  this  difficult problem.   A special  department   staffed by technical men with a knowledge of research methods has   been  formed to act as a liaison between the  research staff of the   Association   and  the  managers  and  technical  employees  of   members.   The  principal qualification  of the  personnel of tins   department  is that they can talk &apos; research &apos;  in  mill language and   thus more readily gain the confidence of managers.  It is their duty   to keep  in  close  touch with the  mills and to demonstrate the   practical application of research results, whilst at the  same  time   bringing  to  the  notice of  the  research  staff  the  difficulties   experienced in the mills and  suggestions for further work.   The   second method is the issue at intervals of six weeks of the Shirley   Institute Bulletin.   This Bulletin is a confidential publication  to   members, and its  main object is to bring to their early notice any   research result of immediate  practical  importance.    A  strong   feature of this publication  is that it is written in a style which   appeals to the mill managers and technical men in the industry, by   whom it is  highly valued.   The  third method  adopted by the   Council is the  provision  of experimental workrooms in  which a   range of cotton spinning and manufacturing  machinery has been   installed. This allows for a practical application on a works scale   of research results and discoveries made in the laboratories, and   also gives facilities  for  the trying out  of mechanical  and  other   inventions.&quot;   83.   There,  still,  remain  in   many   industries  a  widespreadscepticism as to the advantages  of scientific  research and  a reluct-ance  to  make   use  of  the  results which  research  has  furnished.Some of the research associations which have been established have experienced great difficulty in  winning the  general confidence of theindustries  concerned,  and  their activities  have  been  limited  byinadequate financial resources.  The scheme of research associationshas no counterpart in any other country and represents an attempt  tobuild up an organisation  of industrial research adapted  to Britishneeds and  British psychology.  In the main  the progress which hasbeen achieved by these associations  within a comparatively brief periodmay fairly be said to have been satisfactory.  Few of these associationsare as yet self-supporting,  and in view of the valuable services whichthese bodies render to industry,  we trust that it will be  possible forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to provide them with financialassistance on a scale sufficient  to enable them to function effectively,until such time  as industry is in  a position to  bear the whole of their cost.               (c)  Research conducted by large firms.   34.   In  the  preceding  paragraphs we have  given a brief accountof the organisation for industrial research which  has been built up under  the  auspices of the Department of Scientific  and industrial research.  No account, however, of the research activities of Britishindustry  would  be  complete without reference  to  the . researchlaboratories maintained  by  large  industrial concerns, such as theGeneral  Electric   Company,  Metropolitan-Vickers  and   imperial chemical Industries.  When industries are so highly rationalised as  tobe dominated by one or two very large concerns, it is natural and appro-priate  that these concerns should  undertake  their own  scientific research.  These privately-owned  laboratories  raise no  question  ofpublic policy.   We confine  ourselves,  therefore,  to saying that then-efficiency is, we believe,  high and will stand comparison with that  of similar laboratories anywhere abroad. II.-THE  PROPOSAL FOR A NEW NATIONAL RESEARCH                        ORGANISATION.                  (a)  New industries and research.   35.   Having thus reviewed the  existing organisation, we are nowin a  position to consider  the proposal submitted  to us in our terms  ofreference.     [7059]                                                0 2
    86.   This  proposal  contemplates   the  creation  of  a  central organisation,   independent  of   existing  Government  and  privateorganisations, which, among other functions, would        (a) &quot;draw  up programmes of  research  into  the  practical    application  in industry of ideas, inventions  or processes at  present    undeveloped in this country  and, so far as existing agencies are    concerned,  likely to remain undeveloped&quot;;       (b) &quot;institute  the  necessary researches  either  by utilising    existing  facilities or by providing special facilities ad hoc.&quot;    87.   The first question which arises in connection with this pro-posal is whether  it  is intended that  the new organisation  shouldreplace  any part  of the  existing  organisation, described  in  thepreceding section.   This,  we understand, is definitely not intendedby the supporters of the proposal which we are examining.  We havehad the  advantage of  hearing evidence  from Mr. A. P. M.  Fleming,of  the  Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Co.,  Ltd.,  who has  beenforemost  in  advocating a  new  research organisation of  the  typeproposed.   Mr. Fleming stated  emphatically  that he  was a strongsupporter of  the work  of the research associations, and made  it  clearthat it  would be no part of the functions of  the new organisation,as he conceived it, to do  work which lay within the province  of any existing  institution.  His contention was that there was an importantgap  in  our  existing arrangements for  industrial research, which  itwould be the purpose of the new organisation to fill.   38.   The next question accordingly is whether it  is true  that sucha gap exists.  It would be unreasonable, of course,  to expect  to find that all the  work of industrial research that might advantageously beundertaken  is being undertaken  in this country at  the present time.The pursuit  of industrial research, under our  present arrangements,is necessarily  limited by  the financial resources available,  by thesupply of scientific workers of the requisite quality, and by the extentto which industry appreciates its  value  and is  ready to support it.Industries differ greatly from one another in their appreciation of scientific  research,   the   tendency  being  for  comparatively  new industries,  which have sprung  up  as the result  of  the  technicaldiscoveries of the modern age, to  have a lively sense of its possibilities,while an attitude of specticism is apt to linger in older industries wheretraditions of craftsmanship are strong.  We do not doubt, therefore,that in the  latter  type of industry particularly,  much research  workmight  usefully be pursued which is at present left  undone..  It may prove  desirable that  the  Department  of  Scientific and industrial research should establish  a branch for  the  purpose of taking theinitiative in  the stimulation of research in industries where no researchassociation exists or where more research is needed.    39.   This,  however,  is  a  different matter  from  a  gap  in ourresearch arrangements.   The  research association  movement hasalready done much  to stimulate  an interest in research in industries which formerly were backward in their appreciation of its possibilities.Though  this educative process is necessarily gradual,  and subject  tooccasional set-backs and disappointments, we  doubt whether  greaterprogress would be secured by attempting to work on more centralisedlines, inasmuch as the value of  research depends on a readiness  toapply its results.   Moreover,  as is  shown by  the list  of research establishments maintained directly by the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research, including,&apos;  for example,  the  Building ResearchStation where such problems as weathering, the structure and strengthof  materials,  vibrations  and  wind  pressures, earth  pressures  andfatigue of materials, and architectural acoustics are being scientificallystudied,  the Department is always willing to  create organisations  ofits own in important industrial fields where it recognises that a need for research exists.    40.   Nor is it in  order to meet  the needs of those  branches  ofindustry where the attitude towards research is backward that a new organisation is suggested.   The supporters of the  proposal under examination base their case  on a distinction which  they regard  as  ofgeneral applicability and of fundamental importance.  They distinguish
 sharply  betwet r research  that  is  directed  to  the improvement  of existing industries, on the one hand, and research that is directed  to the creation of new industries on the other.  According to this  view. the deficiency of the present system of research establishments lies  in the fact  that,  since  it  is  their  function to study  the  problems  of industries which already exist, they are exclusively  preoccupied with the first  of  the  above objectives.   No research establishment exists to-day with  the  defined function  of creating new industries, and it  is primarily for this purpose that the new organisation  is proposed.  By this means, it is claimed, a valuable contribution would be  made  to the problem of unemployment, for,  whereas employment is increased by the establishment of new industries, it  is usually diminished (so the argument runs)  by the improvement of existing ones.  The foregoing distinction  between two  radically different types or  aims of  research is thus the crux of the case which  we  are called on to examine.    41.  We have considered  very carefully  everything that has been urged in  support of this  distinction,  but  we are unable to accept it  as valid.  It seems to us to rest on a misconception of the  nature  of scientific research and  of the way  in which new industries are created. Morn  often than not,  the discovery  that proves to be the basis of an important industrial development is  largely fortuitous.  The research worker, that is to say,  is not trying to discover the  thing that he does discover.  His object is rather  to increase the body of systematic know- ledge in a certain defined field of phenomena.  As a general proposition. it is hardly too much  to  say that  the less the scientific worker is con- cerned to produce some specific result and the more he is animated by the spirit of disinterested scientific curiosity, the more likely he  is  to hit upon  fruitful discoveries.  The recognition of this truth is indeed the first principle of the. wise direction of scientific research.    42.  It is true that cases sometimes arise in which it is appropriate to use the methods of  scientific research  for the attainment  of some specific industrial purpose.   For this to be possible, however, two con- ditions are  essential.   In the first place,  there must exist already  a considerable body of accumulated scientific knowledge in the field  of phenomena concerned.   Secondly, the objective of research must be clearly defined and must present possibilities of direct attack in the light of the scientific knowledge available.   It sometimes happens, that is to say, that the body of scientific knowledge has  reached  a  stage  at which it presents certain defined problems not yet resolved, but offering manifest possibilities of solution.   When this position has been reached in  any field of industrial  phenomena,  the opportunity  exists for establishing new industrial processes by direct research attack.  Such cases arise, however,  comparatively  rarely, and when they arise the Department of Scientific  and Industrial Research is willing  to explore them.   The  leading instance, for example, at the  present  time  of  a defined  industrial problem not  yet  satisfactorily  solved   is  the economical extraction of oil from coal. This has been for several years the leading preoccupation of the Fuel Research  Board maintained by the Department of  Scientific and  Industrial Research.    48.  We are thus  at a  loss to imagine  how a new organisation established for the purpose of research directed to the creation  of new industries would  set to  work  if it were not to  trench on ground  that  is already covered.   Where a defined problem exists offering the oppor- tunity of direct  research attack,  it  would probably find that some establishment  working under  the auspices or with  the knowledge, of the Department  of  Scientific  and Industrial Research  was  already actively engaged  upon its  solution. For the rest, it.could only proceed along the  lines of endeavouring to  add to the body of systematic know- ledge in particular  fields  of  phenomena, and again  it would probably find the ground covered by institutions working under the auspices of the Department  of  Scientific  and Industrial Research.  A  general instruction to concern  itself not  with the improvement of existing industries but with the creation of  new ones could serve only to paralysethe activities of tho new organisation.  The line between a new industry and the improvement of an existing one is indeed very far from being a  sharp distinction.    Whether   a particular  discovery  should  be described in the one way or in the  other is often essentially a  matter of
terminology which turns more  on the scale  of  the  industrial conse- ;quences that follow than on the nature of the discovery itself.   44.  For these  reasons   we  reject as  unsound the  distinctionbetween the two types of industrial research on which the advocates ofthe new organisation base their case.  Nor, in our judgment, can anysupport for this distinction be found in the activities  of the institutionwhich has. we  understand, served largely to inspire the proposal weare examining, namely, the  Mellon Institute in  the  United States ofAmerica.  The principle of the  organisation of industrial research atthe Mellon Institute is that particular problems are set to the Instituteby industrial firms or associations or individual persons,  the scientificworker being found and engaged by the Institute,  and an  industrial&apos;Fellowship being assigned to him for  a period of at least  one  year.These problems are generally of  a limited character, arising within theindustrial field with which  the firm  or association which acts as thedonor of the industrial Fellowship is concerned.  The results of the investigation belong exclusively  to the  donor  of the Fellowship.   Theresearches that are carried out  in  this  way  are  researches  of anessentially similar character to  those carried out  by the research associations of Great Britain.  The Mellon Institute also recognises theneed of fundamental scientific research as a background and source ofstimulus for industrial research, and it  prosecutes accordingly from itsown funds  investigations  that  are  not  suggested  by industry  butplanned  within the  Institute and  directed  towards the  study  of.problems more  fundamental than those usually conducted for industrial purposes.   Here again  the work of the Institute  is analogous in character  to that of the organisations maintained by the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research, and there is nothing in the workof the Mellon Institute to suggest that it aims at creating new industriesrather than  at  improving existing ones.   45.  Having regard to the importance of an accumulated body of scientific knowledge, the research association  method of Great Britainpossesses  one  clear  advantage over the industrial Fellowship methodof the Mellon Institute.  The Mellon Institute, dealing as it does withthe particular  problems submitted to it from  outside,  now in  oneindustry and now in another, has constantly to shift its attention toentirely different fields of investigation.  The British research associa-tions,  on  the  other hand,  being concentrated on  the problems ofparticular industries, are able to develop a continuity of work which seems likely to lead in the long run to more fruitful discoveries.  Asagainst this advantage, however, there is a prima facie possibility of a disadvantage arising from the British  plan of continuous research inspecialised industrial spheres.  A discovery may emerge, as the  resultof the work  of a research association, which is not of direct interest tothe industry with which the research  association is connected.   Thequestion arises whether, under our present arrangements, such results are apt to be allowed to go to waste through a failure to make  themknown to  the industries which would be most  likely to he interested intheir application.  Upon this point, however, the evidence given to us was reassuring. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Researchkeeps  in  close touch  with all  research associations and is   fullyacquainted with the work which they are doing.  Moreover, a clearing-house has been established by the Department for the express purposeof securing that information about any discovery made by a particularresearchassociation which might bo of interest to another industry  is passed on to it.    46.  There thus appears,  on  the  whole, to be little  danger inpractice that discoveries arising in one part of tho industrial field as the by-product of research there carried on will be wasted  through lack of knowledge of  them in  the  industries to which they are  chiefly ofinterest.                        (b)  Large scale tests.    47.   So far, therefore, as research and the making known of theresults of research are  concerned, we can find no justification for any criticism  of the adequacy of our existing arrangements,  or any  scope for useful work by a new centralised organisation.   The statement of
                                r -15  the functions of the proposed organisation, however, asset out in our  terms of reference, goes  beyond the organising and  undertaking of  research,  and great  stress was  laid  on  these  other functions  by  Mr. Fleming in the evidence which he gave us.     48.   According to our terms of reference it is proposed that the  new organisation should-        (c)   arrange,  as and when  the  results of the researches  so     undertaken warrant  that course,  for further tests on an  industrial     scale  in order to establish the economic  possibilities of the idea,     invention or process &quot; :        Ul) &quot; undertake,  in proper cases, the  further negotiations and     arrangements  necessary to  secure  the fullest application in  the     national interest of any results obtained.&quot;     49.  It  is a  commonplace  that  there  is frequently a  wide gap  between  the demonstration of a  new industrial process on a laboratory scale  and its demonstration on  an industrial scale.  There is, accord hrgly, frequently a long interval  after  a discovery has been  made  in the laboratory before use is made of it in the world of industry.  Manu- facturers  may feel uncertain  whether the discovery will really  work upon  an industrial scale, and may  be unable or unwilling to risk capital in what is necessarily a somewhat risky venture.   In order that the best use may be made of the results of industrial research, it may there- fore often be desirable to promote tests of a promising discovery  upon an industrial scale.  The evidence given to us  by Mr. Fleming seemed to suggest that the undertaking of such  large-scale tests Was, in his mind, perhaps the  most valuable of the functions which  the   new organisation he suggested would discharge.    50.  The question of the extent to which  facilities should be pro- vided  for  large-scale tests,  or for what is sometimes called &quot; develop- ment  research,&quot;  is not.one which  can be settled in general terms. Large-scale tests are necessarily expensive, and it is clearly impossible for this reason to pursue  them in the case of every discovery that may issue  from a research laboratory.   Judgment and  discrimination are needed in deciding when the method of  the large-scale test should be applied.  Subject, however, to the  limitations implied by these general considerations,  the requirements of development research are by  no means neglected in our existing research arrangements.    51.  We have already  referred  to  the fact  that  many  research associations have established departments which are devoted  entirely to development work.   Many of  the activities of the establishments maintained b3T the Department  of Scientific and Industrial Eesearch also belong essentially to the category of development research.   In a memorandum submitted to us the Advisory Council  of the Department have given us the following assurances :         &quot; (a) That ....  where a proved need arises for expenditure    from public funds to enable  a research association  to develop an    adequate trial of some promising instrument, plant or process, the    Advisory Council will not hesitate to recommend the inclusion of    the necessary provision in the  estimates of the Department, as in    the somewhat similar circumstances of the suggested Locomotive    Experimental  Station.   But  we consider that each case  must be    judged on its merits and  not according to some preconceived plan;       &quot; (b)  That, in continuation of their established policy,  if  a    proved need  arises, the Council will similarly recommend  the    inclusion of necessary provision in the estimates of the Department    lor large-scale trials, following the precedents of  the Fuel Eesearch    Station and the Ditton Fruit  Eesearch Laboratory;       &quot; (c) That it is part of the Council&apos;s policy to explore the possi-    bility  of further action  to ensure  that the fullest use is  made of    the facilities of the Department and the research associations for    tests   of  promising  plants   and  processes   as   to   technical    performance,  so as to  aid industry in determining whether  to    undertake an extended  trial  of them under full scale commercial    conditions.&quot;    52. It is possible, of course,  to argue that large scale  trials ofpromising  processes  could with  advantage  be  undertaken more frequently than is done at present.  The Department has to  obtain the
sanction of the Treasury for its estimates, and it may be that develop-ment research work which it would be desirable to carry out is fromtime to time restricted on financial grounds.  So far as organisation isconcerned, however, the requirements of development research seemadequately provided  for by the  machinery  of the Department  of scientific and Industrial Research, and provide no useful scope in our judgement  for the creation of a new organisation.                  (c) New industries and finance.   58.  After the possibilities of a new industrial discovery have beendemonstrated as completely as it is possible for a research organisation to demonstrate  them,  it  remains,  of   course,  uncertain  whetherindustry will think it worth while to take advantage of the discovery.The  new industrial process, though technically feasible, might prove to be economically unremunerative.  This is a question which calls for business judgment,  and the  last word   must necessarily  rest  withbusiness men.   54.  It is sometimes alleged that British business men are undulyslow and unadventurous in exploiting the opportunities opened  up bythe  new  inventions.  Cases certainly  exist, of which  the Perkin-Gilchrist discovery of aniline  dyes is the classic  example, in whichprocesses have been discovered by  British inventors but left to foreignmanufacturers to  exploit.   It  is difficult to see,  however, how this deficiency, in so far  as it exists, can be remedied by the creation of anew   organisation  concerned  primarily  with research.   On thecontrary,  in so far  as  any reluctance on the part  of our industrialleaders to experiment with new inventions is attributable to a lack efcontact with the scientific world and of appreciation of scientific possLbilities, the existing system of research  associations seems to us,  aswe have already indicated,  the best means of supplying a remedy.   55.  It is suggested by the advocates of a new  organisation thatthe chief difficulty in securing the exploitation of  a  new invention inGreat Britain is frequently the  difficulty of finance.  According to thisview,  a  new  process  may   have  been  discovered by  research;industrialists may exist  who are anxious to adopt it;  but in order to doso they&apos; may require a large capital which they may  find it impossibleto obtain on reasonable  terms.  It  is, we  understand, in order to over-come this  difficulty that  the final function of the proposed  organisation,according to our terms of reference, is        &quot;To undertake,  in  proper  cases,  the further negotiations arid   arrangements  necessary to secure the  fullest application in the   national interest of any results obtained.&quot;   5G.  It is no  doubt  the ease that an  industrialist may at times be prevented by the difficulty of  raising capital  from  exploiting a newinvention the  economic benefits of which are  speculative.   But this raises a question of financial organisation which  is by no meanspeculiar to new  inventions.   The business  man  who  sees  a neweconomic  opportunity of  any  kind,  for  example, the starting of a newspaper or the building  of a new hotel, may similarly find himselfhandicapped by the difficulty of raising the necessary capital on easyterms.  It is sometimes urged that the British banking system, thoughpossessing many peculiar  advantages, is less well equipped than thebanking systems  of  some  other  countries for supplying  long-term capital for the initiation  of new enterprises, and  suggestions havesometimes been made,  as, for  example,  by the Macmillan Committeeon Finance and  Industry, for the creation of an industrial bank tosupply this deficiency.  We regard it as beyond our province to discusshow far such  criticisms are well  founded or such remedies desirable.But, as we see it, the question of obtaining capital for the exploitation of new inventions belongs  to this  category of problem. Nothing wouldbe gained in our judgment by  attempting to mix up such problems offinancial  organisations with   the  totally  different  problem  of  the-organisation of research.
         III OTHER PROPOSALS SUBMITTED  TO THE                           COMMITTEE.     57.  We proceed lo consider certain other suggestions  which have  been put before us in the course of our inquiry.     (a)  A Development Fund for the Department of Scientific and                         Industrial Research.     58.  The  representatives  of  the  British   Scientific  Instrument  Research Association expressed the view that the most  effective help  that  could  be given  immediately  to the industrial application  of  promising research  results would be  the creation  of a  Development  Fund  for financing the  large-scale  experiments and tests which are  often  essential  before  new  ideas,  inventions  or  processes  can  be  adopted by  industry.   The  Department of Scientific and Industrial  Research was, in their view, well  fitted  to administer such a fund  by  reason  of its constitution, its experience and its contacts over  a wide  field of industry.    59.   Up to the present, the  Department of Scientific and Industrial Eesearch has had at its disposal a small fund capable of being used for developrnenf purposes.  This fund was originally voted  in 1921 as a non-surrenderable grant-in-aid and  then amounted to  39,500.   In practice, it  has  been mainly used to enable  estimates  to be  drawn closely by the elimination of items for contingencies, in other  words, it has served to keep under the  Advisory Couneil&apos;s own control reserve- funds  which would otherwise have been distributed  over  the  appro- priation for its various research establishments.   On one occasion only, according to our information, was the fund used for  a purpose at all analogous to that  which the representatives of  the British Scientific Instrument Eesearch Association appeared to have in mind.  This was some six or seven years ago,  when with Treasury authority (obtained very promptly) it  was used to buy, for approximately  15,000, the- English rights in the Bergius process for the hydrogenation of coal; thus   securing  for  the  Department  full  scientific  and  technical- knowledge of that process.    GO.   In deference, we are  informed,  to the  views of the  Public- Accounts Committee, it has been decided that the remaining balance of this Fund, which is now about  12,000, shall be surrendered  to the Exchequer at the end of the current financial year.  Thereafter, we understand,  part of the Departments net Estimate will  be shown as a surrenderable margin for development of existing research activities or for unforeseen requirements  which would be  available for expen- diture on the recommendation of the Advisory Council.  The existence of a small fund capable of being readily used for development purposes is, in our opinion, highly desirable.                               ,      (b) A compulsory levy for support of research associations.    61.   It has been suggested to  us that it would  be desirable that powers should exist to ensure that  in  industries where  research associations have been established with a large majority backing, the minority of firms which remain outside  should be compelled to join the association.  There are, however,  serious practical difficulties in the way of any general system of compulsory levies.   There is, in the first place, the familiar difficulty  of  defining  the limits of a  given industry, a  difficulty  which under modern  conditions is tending to increase rather than to diminish. Secondly, there is  the difficulty thatoften  more than one industry  is interested in the work of  a particular research association,  though the interest of different  industries maynaturally vary greatly.  Some research associations are supported notonly by manufacturers, but by  leading distributors as well.   their interest is comparatively slight, but their support is none the less ofgreat value, though clearly only obtainable on a voluntary basis.   Forthese and other reasons,  we do not consider that  any  general powers-should  be taken to  enforce  compulsory  levies  for  the  support of research associations.  Should  an industry,  however,  succeed in working out a practicable scheme involving a compulsory levy for the-    [7059]                                                 n
support of a research  association, which it can show  commands  thesupport of a substantial majority of  the industry, including the largerconcerns, we consider  that the Government should be ready to assistthe industry in obtaining the necessary Parliamentary powers.      (c) The preparation by Government of scientific digests.    62.   In the course of his evidence before  us,  Dr. S. G. Barker,Director of Reseai-ch  of the Wool  Industries  Research Association,suggested that the Department of Scientific and Industrial research should  be equipped with  an  organisation for preparing digests of scientific literature of interest to industry.  In  view of the very largenumber of scientific and technical papers published annually these were  estimated  in 1981  at  about 750,000   papers,  published  by15,000  periodicals it was quite impossible even for a well-equippedresearch association to examine all scientific publications dealing withthe work of their industry.  It was for this reason that he recommendedthat the  Government  should itself undertake, the responsibility of preparing digests of current scientific literature.          *    68.   The problem  created by the growth  of scientific literature isone which  has long  engaged,  and is  now actively engaging,  theattention of the scientific world.  It is  to-day impossible even for  the specialist to keep in touch with all that is published even in his limitedfield, and research is becoming more dependent upon the organisations which  issue digests or abstracts of  papers falling within a specialisedfield.   At present,  abstract publications are, for the most part, issuedby  scientific  institutions,  learned  societies  or   similar  bodies.Proposals have been put forward at various times by scientific societies,both in this country and on the Continent, aiming at securing greater co-ordination  in the preparation of  scientific bibliographies.   Thisquestion has also formed the subject of special study by a committeeof scientific advisers appointed  by the International  Committee  forIntellectual  Co-operation.   The  recommendations  made  by  that committee are at  present under consideration by scientific authoritiesin  this country, and we do not consider that, at any  rate, for  themoment,  it would be advisable for the Government itself to set up ajournal-abstracting organisation. Indeed, it is doubtful whether, evenif it were practicable, it would be desirable for the work of abstractingto be centralised in a single  organisation, whether under government or not,  for an abstractor working in a central institution might  easily,and even deliberate^&apos;,  exclude from his abstract an observation which.though not forming part of the main theme of  an  article, might be of vital interest to one or other of the specialised abstracting institutions-among  which the field is at  present divided.               IV. SUMMARY OF  CONCLUSIONS.    64.   We summarise our  conclusions as follows :      (i) Having examined the various arguments which have been  put          forward in support of the proposed establishment of a new          national  research  organisation  as outlined in  our terms of          reference, we consider that such an organisation  would  out          right across  the existing  organisation of the Department of          Scientific and Industrial  Research, and  would be likely in          practice,  by the confusion of purpose and distraction of effort          it would cause, to injure rather than to forward the cause of          scientific research in British Industry.    (ii) Moreover, we are  satisfied that  the  existing Government          organisation  for  the promotion  of  industrial  research is          efficient, and is sufficiently flexible  to enable  it to develop          along such lines  as may  be desirable to meet the changing          needs of industry.    (iii) We are, therefore, unable to recommend the establishment of          a new national organisation along the lines suggested.    (iv) It is  highly desirable that there should be at the disposal of          Government a small fund capable of being readily used for          research  developments, such  as  that which is  at present          at the disposal of the Advisory Council for Scientific  and          Industrial Research. We  consider, therefore, that when  the
     balance of this fund Is surrendered to the Exchequer at the     end of the current year, a sum of money should continue to     be available  for  expenditure  on research developments or     unforeseen requirements by suitable provision In the Depart-     menfs annual Estimate.(v) The evidence  which  we have received  shows  clearly how     valuable  are  the services  rendered to  industry  by  the     research  associations established  by particular industries,     and we trust that it will be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-     ment to  continue to provide financial  assistance  to  these     bodies on a scale sufficient  to enable them  to  function     effectively until such time as industry is  In a position to bear     the whole of their oost.(Signed).T.
