With CP.  190 (32)  the  President of the Board of Trade cir- culated a statement showing the value of the trade between this country and Russia for each of the months January 1931 to April  193E In accordance with the conclusion reached by the Cabinet on Sth  June that the President should keep them informed of any developments in trade with Russia.    I now circuls.te the corresponding figures for May and June,  the latest  available:        Imports from    Exports to Soviet Union        Excess of        Soviet Union           (Russia)  ___       Imports over         (Russia)       United  Kingdom                     Exports.                       Produce and    Imported__^______________Manufacture.........Me re hand i se________________                                        &quot;                         1,040,578       450,927          79,054          500,597        1,916,279       569,151         146,012        1,201,115 2.      The visible adverse balance month by month had fallen steadily from a maximum of over  4,000,000 in October 1931 until in April 1932 the  visible balance had even turned in our favour. This process has now been arrested.    Imports from Russia, which for January to May of this year, had been far below the correspond- ing figures of last year, have in June gone up to about the same amount as in June  1931.   On the other hand British exports to Russia after standing through the past winter on a much higher level than formerly have fallen off considerably in May and June.   As was explained in CP.  190 (32) the decrease was not unexpected in view of the reduced Export Credit facilities made available for trade with Russia  in recent months,  and there is no doubt that the value of British Exports to Russia in the second half of the year is likely to be substantially below the value for the first six months.
       Part II.    Cuestion of guaranteeing additional  credits.1.       This falling off in exports to Russia compels me inaocordance with Cabinet Conclusion 25 (32)-- 7(c)  to raise again the question of guaranteeing further credits for such exports.I may recall that in April last with the support of theAdvisory Committee to the Export  Credits Guarantee Department,the president of the Board of Trade put before the Cabinet aproposal for credits for  4,000,000 but owing to the absence,through illness, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the cabinet agreed, at that time to  1,600,000 but it was agreed that he(Mr. Runciman) should be at liberty to raise the question of theremaining  2,400,000 at any time.2.       The orders for  1,600,000 for which credits were agreed by the Cabinet in April last, Cabinet Conclusion 25(32),have now been placed and the delivery of the goods will becompleted within a short period.   Thenceforward unless furthercredits are available exports- to Russia of British manufacturedgoods are likely to diminish to a very s?jall figure.   Suchcredits are not likely to be provided to any appreciable extent by manufacturers themselves since most of them are unable togrant such credits even if they were willing to do so at theirown risk.   In the absence of further facilities through theExport Credits Guarantee Department therefore, the trade balance with Russia is likely to become much more unfavourablein the autumn than it has been in the last few months.3.       The  orders now in contemplation are practicallyexclusively for machinery and iron  axid steel products which havea high employment value.   Orders for  2,400,000 of goods of thiskind would probably represent employment direct and indirect ofnot less than 12,000 for one year.   As most of the goods willbe manufactured in about six months, this would employ say,24,000 men for that period.   The value of this employment isnot to be measured merely by its volume,&apos;  the industries which                          -2-
would benefit from these orders arc amongst the most important,and many of the workpeople who would be provided with employmentamongst the most highly skilled in the country.   The coalindustry, in which unemployment has recently increased,  standsto benefit materially through orders taken by the heavy industriIn addition there should be taken into account the benefitto the Exchequer from income tax on profits, and the savings tothe Unemployment Fund by the reduction in the amount of benefitto be paid and the increase in contributions.          It may be added that in the course of enquiries madeby the Ministry of Labour at the beginning of June and coveringmany (not all) of the firms then engaged on Russian orders, itwas found that from 3,000 to 9,000 workpeople were directlyengaged on such orders and that a corresponding number wouldbe thrown out of work if further orders cf this kind were not obtained.4.       It is noteworthy that there -.is achange of attitude in Parliament in  this matter.   During thepast winter the comments from the Government Benches have been almost exclusively directed against Russia.   Recently howeverConservative members have been pressing increasingly for thecontinuance, of the credit facilities.   Early in July theattached memorial, signed by 15 Conservative M.P&apos;s., v/as sentto the President of the Board of Trade pressing for furthercredits for exports to Russia, particularly in view of the new agreement made between Germany and Russia.5.       The new German agreement governs the conditions onwhich goods shall be exported by Germany to Russia up to theSlst May, 1933.   The terms of credit offered.,, which vary according to the nature of the goods, run from 14 to a maximum of 29 months from delivery.   iTo figure is mentioned but there
so is  reason to believe  that  the  credits during the 12 months in  question may  amount  to  Rifles.  400,000,000, i.e. about  26,000,000.    6.   As to  the  risk  involved  in  granting these credits the Government is  advised  by an  Advisory Committee of bankers etc    This Committee are  satisfied that provided iiritish credits do not exceed say  13 months, the risk is one which they can  recommend up to a certain  figure  and subject to proper  technical conditions.   These conditions provide, inter alia, for the payment of a substantial premium to the British Exchequer and  that the  guarantee shall in  no case amount to more  than 75%  of the  credit.   With  these  conditions I am in entire  agreement.   In  making  this  recommendation the Committee have  particularly  in  mind  the  fact  that the German Government is  giving credits  up  to 29 months.   So long as British credits do  not  exceed  18 months, they  feel  that we shall be in fact in  a  preferential  position vis-a-vis Germany and certain other countries as creditors  of  Russia.    By technical arrangements of  this kind they  feel  that the  risk can be kept to quite moderate  proportions.    7.   The Federation  of  3ritish Industries have recently urged that a further   5,000,000  of  credits shall be provided for Russian orders up to the end of  1932.   The Russian Government have  intimated  that they have definite orders to place for this amount and  after  examination I am satisfied that this  statement is  substantially  accurate and that genuine orders for this  sort of amount would be placed if credit can be given.    8,   At  the same time I  do not ask for  such a large figure as  this.    The amount of   2,400,000 which was asked for in April  was recommended by the  Department&apos;s Advisory Committee. Since that  date Russian bills continue to be paid punctuallyaccording  to schedule and the Advisory Committee  have  again                          - 4 -
been consulted and again recommend a further  2,400,000 of credit to make up the total of  4,000,000 recommended lastApril.   9.   The additional financial risk involved in thisproposal would be much smaller than the figures suggest.During the last quarter of the present year bills for over 1,200,000 will run off so that the additional hills now contemplated would amount to only about  1,200,000.   Sincethe Export Credits Guarantee Department does not assumeliability for more than 75$ of any of these bills and alsoreceives an appreciable premium in cash the additional risk to H.IvI. Government is reduced to a comparatively low figurethus:                                                 Government.

I should have liked to put forward this proposalfor a further  2,400,000 of credit on the understanding thatin the absence of unforeseen developments it would cover therest of 1932, instead of the period to the end of September.But the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, whom I have consulted on this proposal, has stated that he would have to consult&apos; the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Ottawa and that hecould not recommend the Chancellor to agree to it.    He points
 out, however,  that bills for slightly over  1,500,000 fall due during the last three months of 1952 and he would bo will- Lng to agree to the Department entering into new commitments for this amount before the end of the present calendar year,.     I am prepared to agree to this subject to the right of the President of the Board of Trade to raise the question of further credits at any time.11.   We have already succeeded in reducing considerablythe length of the  credits granted to Russia and it is intendedto continue the same policy.    Consequently the  maximum lengthof  credit covered by these further guarantees would be18  months and. a substantial proportion should be at 12 months.The Advisory Committee however have drawn my attentionto  the fact that a certain amount of business might beobtained on credits of still shorter periods, say 3, 6or  9 months.   They are extremely anxious to encouragebusiness on these short terms and they therefore suggestthat they should be empowered to do so within a certainmoderate limit.   I recommend, therefore, that this limitbe  fixed at  250,000 for the period ending 31st December,1932, and that the apportionment of these short creditsbe  agreed between the Treasury and the Advisory Committeefrom time to time.12.   In making these recommendations the Treasury andthe Advisory Committee have had in.mind the possibility that questions might be raised about the effect upon Russia&apos;s--ability to meet her commitments of any restriction that maybe  imposed upon her sale in the United Kingdom of Russianwheat or other products.

In making these recommendations  the Treasury  and the  Advisory Committee have had in.mind the possibility that questions might be raised about the  effect upon Russia&apos;s.- -ability  to  meet her commitments of  any  restriction  that maybe imposed  upon her sale  in the United Kingdom of Russianwheat or other products.   They note however that Russia&apos;s sterling income from sales in the United Kingdom is at  present
 roughly  30,000,000 per annum of which wheat accounts for only a moderate part;  whilst Russia&apos;s obligations on Export Credits bills amount to roughly  4,000,000 per annum.    (The figures of imports from Russia are:-                                     1930.            1931.

I may add that it would appear preferable to make no announcement of the Cabinet&apos;s decision  on this matter. The  publication of the last  amount ( 1,600,000)  seems to  have put  a  weapon into the  hands  of the Russians  for bargaining with British manufacturers,  and  to have enabled them to demand better terms from Individual  firms as a condition of being included in the total  credit  available.   The  Export Credits Guarantee Department,  in dealing with all  other countries, have always followed the  policy of making no announcement of the amount of credit  it  is prepared  to provide at  any time  and it would  be preferable  to keep  the  Russian business  on  the same footing as other  business  from this point  of view. 14.    I therefore recommend: -  (a) That from  now to  the  end. of December, 1932,  the Export; Credits  Guarantee Department should be  at  liberty  to commit H.M.Government  for  guarantees in connection with credits of 12  months  or more for exports to Rtissia for not more than the amount of bills falling due  in the last quarter  of 1932: vis:-  a little  more  than  1,200,000.  (b)    That none  of  these  credits should be  at longer than 18 months and that  the Export Credits Guarantee  Department should be asked to arrange that  a substantial  proportion  isat twelve months. (c) That  in addition  the Department should be at liberty
to undertake commitments at its discretion in connection withcredits of 9 months or less by arrangement with the  treasury and up to a limit of  250,000 during the  period in question,   (d)   That the decision be treated as  strictly confidential and no public statement made about it,                         (initialled.)

                 House of Commons Library,                      RUSSIAN TRAPS.       Memorandum submitted to the President  of  the                      Board of Trade:-       We, the undersigned. Conservative Members  of Parliament,having noted from the reply given this afternoon by  theSecretary to the Department of Overseas Trade that further government credit facilities may not be granted  in respect ofRussian contracts;  and while fully realising that unrestrictedcredit facilities are not desirable,  respectfully invite theattention of the President of the Board of Trade to  thefollowing facts, namely:-   1.       Several important contracts involving the            possibility of the employment of  a large volume            of labour have been lost  during recent months            because export credit facilities  have not been            available.   2,       Several contracts are now  on offer to British            firms for manufactured articles amounting to            millions of pounds, in value which will inevitably            be lost to British industry in the absence of an            extension of Government credit insurance facilities:            and   3.       The recent Trade Agreement concluded between  y            Germany and the U.S.S.R. will really result in a            large volume of business which might be  placed in            this country being passed  on to German manufacturers,and, in view of these facts, urge upon the President of theBoard of Trade that he should impress  upon the Cabinet the
vital necessity of enlarging and extending  the existingexport credits facilities  to British  trade  with Russiawithout delay.               H.  Leslie Boyce.               P-J.
