THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  Augiist  1932.SECRET.Copy  No.   QCP. 280 (32).CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR                    FOREIGN AFFAIRS.     IN the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I circulate herewith, forthe information of my colleagues, the text of the Protocol providing for further financial assistance to Austria which was signed at Geneva on the 15th July,together with a translation of a letter addressed by the Austrian Chancellor tothe President of the Committee convened by the Council of the League of nations to examine this question, and of the President^ reply.     2.  It will be remembered that in March last the Financial Committee of theLeague of Nations recommended guaranteed loans for Austria, Greece and othercountries and  that this recommendation was  supported in principle  by theFrench Government.  The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was decided at aConference of Ministers on the 2nd May, 1932, at which the Prime Minister, theLord President, the Chancellor of the  Exchequer,  the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the President of the Board of Trade and the Lord Privy Sealwere present. The conclusions reached were:      (1) That the British representative at the forthcoming (i.e., April) meeting           of the Council should state that His Majesty&apos;s Government was not           prepared to agree to Guaranteed Loans on the lines proposed by the           Finance Committee, but that they considered that Austria had certain           claims to special treatment and that they would be ready to join with           other countries in extending assistance to Austria by means of a loan.     (2) That it should be a condition of the  loan that any  money provided by           this country  should be used to repay the Bank of England advance           and that the new money provided should come from France and other           countries, and that this should be made clear from the first.     3.  The  Protocol signed  on the  15th July  provided that the signatory governments shall undertake to apply without delay for such authority as maybe required under  their municipal law to enable them either to guarantee thefollowing amounts,  or to furnish such amount to the Austrian Government in another manner :     4.  It is hoped that Switzerland will guarantee 12 million gold Schillingeand Czechoslovakia some small amount.  Representations are also being made to spain, Sweden and Denmark in the hope that they may also contribute their mite.    5.  The  guarantees  are  separate  and hot joint.  The guarantee of HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be limited to the issue in London, and this will  beused exclusively to repay to the Bank of England the outstanding balance of the advance which they made to the Government of Austria in the summer of 1931.United KingdomFrance  ...ItalyBelgium ...Holland ...100 million gold Schillinge (say,  3^ million).100 million gold Schillinge. 30 million gold Schillinge.5 million gold Schillinge.3 million gold Schillinge.6490  [7400]B
     6.  The loans are to be for a term of 20 years and are all to rank pari passu.     7.  The Austrian Government undertake to restore and maintain  completebudget equilibrium and. to carry out a detailed, programme of budgetary reforms,and the.League of Nations are to appoint an adviser to the Austrian Government(M. Rost, a Dutchman) and an adviser to the National Bank of Austria (M. Frere,a Belgian).        ,            ,&apos;-   v    .                      &apos;     8.  Ah essential condition of the recovery of Austria is that her monetary policy should be revised  and that, the depreciation  of the Schilling which exists in  fact  should  be  recognised  by  the monetary  authorities.  This  policy  isforeshadowed in Article 5 of the Protocol as follows :           &apos;&apos; Austrian monetary policy will aim at the abolition as soon as possible     of the difference between the internal and external value of  the  Schilling     and in  consequence  at the progressive removal of  the existing control over     exchange transactions and trie resulting obstructions to international trade.&quot;     9.  The German Government had originally offered to contribute 7 millionSchillings but the French and Italian Governments insisted that  the preamble to the present Protocol must contain a declaration on the part of all  the signatory governments (including the Austrian Government), which signed the ProtocolNo.  1 of the 4th October, 1922 (by which Austria undertook not  to alienate her economic independence) to the effect that the present assistance &quot; is given on thebasis of Protocol No. 1,  signed at Geneva on the 4th  October, 1922, and  of allthe undertakings resulting therefrom, the provisions of which Protocol are to beconsidered as here reproduced.&quot;  The German Government would not have had actually to be a party to this undertaking, since they did not sign  the Protocol of1922, but nevertheless they refused to sign the present  Protocol; it is understoodthat they will contribute their 7 million Schillinge by a separate operation.     10.  It is unfortunate that, owing to the attitude of the French Governmentup  to the last moment on this and other points, the financial assistance to Austriahas been so  long delayed.  It will now not be possible  for the loans to be issueduntil the  French Parliament re-assembles in the autumn,  and the position un austria is so critical that this delay may have serious consequences.     11.  Assuming that the Protocol is ratified, His Majesty&apos;s Government willhave to propose legislation authorising them to guarantee an Austrian loan inthe London  market for approximately   3^ million, the proceeds of which willbe used to repay  the outstanding amount of the temporary advance granted bythe Bank of England.     12.  No doubt such legislation will provoke a good deal of criticism, but thedecision to assist Austria may be defended on numerous grounds.     (1) The effect of the Peace Treaties was to create  a new Austria,  in which          the attainment of economic equilibrium is universally admitted to be          attended with special difficulties.     (2) From the point of view of maintaining credit  in Europe as a  whole, it          is of particular  importance to avoid any fresh financial disaster in          Vienna, which  would have wider repercussions  than difficulties in          other  Central or Eastern European States.     (3) In the absence of financial assistance, Austria  has already defaulted on          a preparatory monthly payment due in respect of the service of the          guaranteed loan of 1923.   This default, if  continued and not made          good, will cost&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government some  800,000 a year.     (4) The Protocol provides for very thorough financial and budgetary  reform          and if these are effectively carried out  this should bring about a real           improvement in the situation.    This affords a reply to the  criticism           that we shall merely, be pouring more money into a bottomless pit.     (5) The loan will no doubt be criticised on the ground that it will enable the          , Bank of England to get its money back at the expense of the taxpayer.     This criticism is quite unjustified.  The Bank of England advance was made,with the  approval of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  as an emergency measure  to
avert a financial disaster last summer.  It was intended as a short-term andvance for a period of a few weeks to save the situation pending the issue of a long-term loan, from the proceeds of which the advance would be repaid.    It  is, therefore, entirely reasonable and proper that part of the proceeds ofthe new Austrian Loan should be used to repay the outstanding balance of the advance, and it is obviously convenient and in the national interest that the sterling portion of the loan issued in London should be used for this purpose.    13.   The. French Parliament will not be in  a  position  to authorise theguarantee 5f the loan to be issued in Paris till the autumn, and there is no reasonfor His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce legislation here until the FrenchParliament have passed the legislation required in  France.    The reaffirmation by the Austrian Government  of the  Protocol of  1922precipitated a Parliamentary crisis  in Austria, and the fate of the legislationratifying the new Protocol is still in doubt. The Bill passed its first reading onthe 2nd August after a motion of non-confidence in the Government had been defeated by a tied vote.                                                          JOHN SIMON.    (1)  Letter from the Austrian Chancellor to the Chairman of the Mixed                   x    Committee, dated J%dy 15, 1932.(Translation.)    The Austrian  Government considers  that it is indispensable  in  existingcircumstances to prolong the Standstill Agreements in force in order to prevent an  undue  strain on  Austrian currency, which  might endanger  the work of reconstruction.    For the same reason  the Austrian  Government,  while  undertaking tofacilitate as soon as possible  the  payment  of commercial debts, and  withoutprejudice to the Agreements concluded in regard thereto,  declares that it wouldnot be possible  for the moment to furnish a foreign exchange  for the immediate and total repayment of these debts.    The Austrian Government declares further that, for the same reason, it findsitself obliged only  to pay  reduced annuities during the  next few years to the creditors of the Credit  Anstalt.             (2)  Reply of the  Chairman of the Miaxed Committee.    I take note of your Excellency&apos;s letter of to-day&apos;s date, of which the text hasbeen communicated to the Committee of which I am  Chairman.  I note further that,  regard  being  had to  the   necessities of  the situation,  the  austrian government undertakes to facilitate  as soon as possible the  payment -of thecommercial debts without  prejudice  to the Agreements concluded in regardthereto.   Copy of your Excellency&apos;s letter has been  communicated  to theGovernments concerned.                            LEAGUE OF NATIONS.

The Government may only draw on the sums standing to the credit  ofthis account  in agreement with the representative of. the League of Nations.
               Programme of Budgetary and Financial Reforms.     1.  In conformity with the declaration made before the Financial Committee by the Austrian Chancellor in September 193i, the Austrian Government will take every step necessary to restore without delay and to maintain equilibrium between its revenue and expenditure.        .:            ...     In order to ensure the application of  this principle from 1932 onwards, further permanent economies sufficient to secure the balancing of the budget for the current financial year, estimated on the basis of present figures at 45 million Schillinge, must be made during  the second half of the current year, in addition to those provided  for in the supplementary budget which has been submitted to the Council of Ministers.     In view of the special circumstances and having regard to the arrangements contemplated in Annex I for reducing the short-term debt of the State,  the ] OO-million-Schillinge surplus provided in the present budget for the repayment of short-term obligations may be applied to current needs, such as the deficit on the Railways.    2.  The Austrian  Government undertakes to carry out  without  delay  the general programme of economies and  reorganisation contained  in the report of Dr. Herold, the railway  expert  who was  entrusted with the enquiry into  the administration  and policy   of the Railway system, in  conformity  with  the declaration  made by the Chancellor last September.    An expert appointed by the Council of the League of Nations shall be invited by  the Austrian  Government to  decide  to what extent the capital  outlays (&quot; Investitionen &quot;) of the Railways are really indispensable and to what extent they could,  in view of the present financial difficulties, be postponed.    3.  All  borrowing operations  of  the  Austrian State, whether external or internal (other than those under the standing authority to issue Treasury Bills up to 75 million Schillinge),  remain subject to the approval of the Committee of Guarantor  States.  The Austrian  State  Railways  shall for  this purpose be regarded as a part of the Austrian State and shall not be authorised to contract any loan  unless the Minister of  Finance  certifies that  the approval of  the Committee of Guarantor  States has been duly obtained.    As regards contracts on a credit basis for supplies or works which involve a substantial  charge on future budgets, including the budget of the Railways,  the representative of the League of Nations shall determine whether these operations present an exceptional character  warranting recourse to the procedure provided for in the preceding paragraph.    Having regard to the provisions of Annex I, no issue of Treasury Bills or-other similar short-term operation  shall  be carried out by  the Austrian Govern- ment on  the home market unless the prior consent of the representative of  the League has been given.    4.  In  conformity  with  the  declaration  of  the  Chancellor  made  last September, the Austrian Government  will use  its existing powers  in order to secure that  the budgets of the &quot; Lander &quot; and of the Communes are balanced.  It will come to an agreement with these local authorities with a view to obtaining such extension of its  powers of control as may be necessary, particularly&apos;as regards borrowing;  all such borrowing  operations must in future be approved by the Austrian Government, which will give its consent on the motion of  the Minister of Finance after previous  consultation with the National  Bank and  the representative of the League of Nations.    5.  Every proposed credit operation, either by a private  individual  or by a public or private corporation, which involves foreign indebtedness of more than 1 million Schillinge, must be brought to the knowledge of the  Austrian National Bank before being carried out.    6.  The Austrian Government  will revise the general legislation on.banks in conformity with the September declaration.    7.  In conformity with  the declaration made in September, and in view of the responsibility  assumed  by  the Austrian  Government  in regard  to  the
Creditanstalt, the Government will take the necessary steps to secure a reductionin the administrative expenses of that bank and of the other banks operating un austria.                                ANNEX III.            League of Nations Representative and Bank Adviser.    1.  The representative of the League of Nations  and the Adviser to theAustrian National Bank appointed under Article 7  of  the Protocol shall carryout the functions assigned to them in the present Protocol and its Annexes. they shall be responsible to the Council and removable by it.    2.  The Austrian Government undertakes to collaborate with the represen-tative of the League of Nations with regard  to the execution of the programmeof reforms contained in  the declaration of September 1931 and in the  presentProtocol, and  further to furnish him  with all the  information which he may require for the execution of his mission.    3.  The representative of the League of Nations will report to the League ofNations every three months on the execution  of the programme of reforms.  HeAvill further address supplementary reports to the League of Nations wheneverhe thinks is desirable to bring any fact as a matter of urgency to the knowledgeof the League.    4.  The provisions concerning the functions of the  Adviser, which formerlyconstituted Articles 124 to 129 of the Statutes of  the Austrian National Bank asenacted by the Federal Law of the 14th November,  1922   Bundesgesetzblatt,&quot;No.  823),  shall  be reincorporated  in  the  Statutes,  except that  the  words&quot; Commissioner-General of the League of Nations  &quot; shall be replaced by the words&quot; Council of the League of Nations.&quot;     5.  The representative of the League of Nations shall provide himself withthe necessary  staff. His  expenses and those of his office shall be approved by theCouncil and defrayed by Austria.  The representative of the League of nations shall enjoy diplomatic privileges; he and his staff shall enjoy fiscal immunities.     6.  The Adviser to the Austrian National Bank shall enjoy fiscal immunities.     7.  If the Austrian Government considers  that the representative of theLeague of Nations,  or  the Adviser  to the National Bank,  has  abused his authority, it may appeal to the Council of the League of Nations.     8.  The Council shall terminate the appointment of the representative of theLeague of Nations and  of the x\dviser to the Bank when it decides that their services are no longer required.     9.
