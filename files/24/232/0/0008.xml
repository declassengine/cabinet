(THIS DOCUIffiNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC             MAJSSTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT) .COPY NO,SECRET.C.P.258 (52)CAB I N E T.                          INDIA        Appreciation of the Political  Situation  bythe Government of India, dated 19th July  1932.        Circulated for  the information of the  Cabinetby the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the PoliticalSituation in India dated 19th July 1932,issued on the authority of the Secretary of               State for India.          Though the  action  taken by the Government during the last  6 months  had been  effective in bringing the Civil Disobedience Movement under  control, yet the situation at the end of June was  not such  as  to  render  it possible to lay aside entirely the special powers  which had  been obtained by means of Ordinances.  The Congress leaders showed no signs of giving up the struggle,  and  there were vindications that if, as a result of any relaxation  of effort,   Government lost the initiative, there would be fresh outbursts.  In this view of the situation, it was decided to  promulgate an Ordinance which made it possible to arm Local Governments with all the main powers given to them by the Ordinances  issued  in January last,  which under the provisions of law  lapsed after  a period of 6 months.          But,  though all the provisions of the new Ordinance can be brought into force in all parts of British India,  yet inmany areas the Movement has  been so weakened that it has been found possible merely to keep the powers in reserve to beused only if this  relaxation leads to any recrudescence ofsubversive activities.  The  only important power which is inforce throughout British India  is that which extends theprovisions of the  Press Act  and enables control to  be exercised over newspapers  and presses which have been used for spreadingdisaffection against the Government.  With this exception,  morethan half of the North West Frontier Province,  the  Punjab andthe United Provinces is entirely free from the Ordinance,  as no special powers are in force in  four out of five districts in theNorth West Frontier Province, 17 out of 29 districts in the punjab,  and 26 out of 48 in the United Provinces.  In Bengal,                                                          the
the special powers are being used chiefly in those districts where the terrorist movement is still a very serious danger.The Uo-Rent Campaign which formed a leading feature of theoriginal programme of Civil Disobedience, especially in theUnited Provinces and in Bombay, has met with so littlesuccess that powers designed to prevent persons misleadingtenants are only being used in 21 districts of the united provinces and in one district of the Bombay Presidency.  Thepowers to deal with picketing and boycotting have beensimilarly restricted,  and even in the Bombay Presidency these powers are not at present necessary in 20 districts.          The fact that Government have kept these powers,even though holding them in reserve, has deprived congress of the hope that it undoubtedly cherished of revivingagitation and recovering its prestige.  During the past month,however,  numerous attempts have been made to stir up interestin the movement and,  especially in the United Provinces,Congress activity has been devoted to organising so-calleddistrict political conferences.  Many of these have beencomplete fiascos and were similar to the abortive annualSession of Congress at Delhi, described  in the appreciation of May last.  In nearly all  c ases the crowd attending these meetings was small and was dispersed without difficulty,  butin some cases there was rowdyism and violence,  as,  forexample,  in the Nadia district of Bengal, where the policewere forced to open fire.  Though many local Congress leaders have been released during the last month on expiry of theirsentences,  they have not succeeded in creating any markedrevival of the movement.  That such persons are,  however,still capable of causing trouble with a gullible aboriginalpopulation is shown by an incident reported from Bihar,  where                                                       some
some released Congress workers persuaded some aboriginalvillagers to attack the police by announcing that the policewere now powerless, and that, on the advent of Swaraj, theywould have to pay no more rent.   The police were assaulted andconfined, hut were released with the assistance of a loyalZamindar .   Various acts of mischief are also reported fromother provinces.   One such prank designed to excite public attention is to stop a train by pulling the communication cord;on the train stopping, a band of youths or children emergeshouting Congress slogans and distributing Congress handbills.Another senseless act.of mischief designed to cause troubleto Government is to damage the contents of letter boxes.  Inthe United Provinces no less than 160 such attempts have beenmade, while telegraph wires have been cut in 58 places and 8attempts have been made to set fire to railway carriages.  Allthese incidents, petty though they are in themselves, go toshow, as observed in the last appreciation, that Congress has still much power for mischief in many parts.  In contrast tothe abortive Congress confer eri-ces, several provinces reportthe successful organisation of loyalist meetings.  In theUnited Provinces many meetings have been organised recentlyby non-official agencies.        The communal situation is still disquieting and atthe end of June there was a serious recrudescence of riotingin Bombay.   On 27th June, there was an increase in the numberof stray assaults and stabbing and a mosque was attacked bystone throwing.  These incidents produced a rapid deterioration in the position and on many occasions Muhammadan funeralprocessions were attached by Hindu hooligans while suchprocessions were seized upon by the -mc-re disreputable element of the- Mohammedan .populati.on .as ,-.an opportunity^of. provoking .strife.   The most recent reports show an improvement. in the                                              situation
 situation, &quot;but  it  is not possible to be too optimistic. Heavy rains have to some extent calmed the ardour of the opposing parties, but feelings are still very tense.  Between 27th  June and 4th July, 31 were killed and 585 injured.  The total casualties since rioting first broke out in May last amount to 214 killed and 2,69 5 injured.   It is not possible to predict what will be the reactions in the various parts of the country of the communal decision which will be announced by His Majestys Government in the summer.          The Secretary of State&apos;s announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view solely to expediting its programme, intended not to hold further meetings of the round Table Conference, but to appoint a Joint Select Committee of Parliament to consider in consultation with Indian representatives concrete proposals before the introduction of a bill, has been received with much suspicion and has been strongly attacked by Hindu liberals,  who have withdrawn their co-operation from the consultative committeewhich, it was hoped, would play an important part in seeking an agreement in India on outstanding points.   the motive which led Government to revise its programme hasbeen  overlooked and little attention has been paid to thefact  that His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the view strongly urged upon them by many Indian leaders and havedecided to deal with both provincial autonomy and federation in a  single bill.-   The developments of the situation thathas now arisen are uncertain.
