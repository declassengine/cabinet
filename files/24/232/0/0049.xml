IMPERIAL  ECONOMIC   CONFERENCE,                OTTAWA,  1932.                SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS.   THE  conclusions  of  the  Conference  may  be  summarised  asfollows:(a) Resolutions and  Statements regarding the Promotion of  Trada                    within the Commonwealth.                        EMPIRE CONTENT.   With regard to the determination of the percentage  of EmpireContent  necessary  to  secure preferential  tariff  treatment,  theConference  draws the attention of the several Governments of theCommonwealth to the importance of this subject, and  recommends that  each  of the   Governments  of  the  Commonwealth  shouldinvestigate, as rapidly as  possible, the standard of Empire Contentwhich should be required by them for the import under preferential rates of the different classes of goods, bearing in mind the following principles :    (a) That though it must rest with each Government to decide what          standard it will  require,  a greater degree of  uniformity          throughout the Commonwealth is desirable:    (b) The standard required should not be such as  to  defeat or          frustrate  the  intention of the preferential  rate of duty          conceded to any class of goods.           EXPORT BOUNTIES AND ANTI-DUMPING  DUTIES.    With regard to the question of export bounties and anti-dumping duties  within the  Commonwealth,  the Conference   adopted the-following resolution :       This  Conference,  recognizing   that   export  bounties  and    exchange  depreciation  adversely  affect  the  value  of   tariff    preferences within the  Commonwealth, expresses  the hope that    with a rise in i the, level of commodity prices^and  with stabilized    exchanges such ToounTiie^^                     which have been-    adopted as a means of adjusting the situation so created, may be    withdrawn.                        TRADE AGREEMENTS.    With  regard  to the conclusion of certain Agreements for theextension of mutual trade  by means of reciprocal preferential tariffs,the Conference adopted the following resolution :       The nations of the British Commonwealth having entered into    certain Agreements with one another for the extension of mutual    trade by means  of reciprocal preferential  tariffs, this  Conference    takes note of these Agreements and records its conviction;       That by the lowering or removal of barriers among  themselves    provided for in these Agreements, the flow of trade between the    various countries of the Empire will be facilitated, and that by the    consequent increase  of purchasing power of their  peoples, the    trade of the world will also be stimulated and increased;       Further, that this Conference regards  the conclusion of  these    Agreements as a step  forward, which should in the future lead    to further progress in  the  same direction,  and which  will utilize    protective duties  to  ensure that the  resources and  industries of    the Empire are developed on sound economic lines.       The Agreements referred, to are annexed  hereto and the-    Conference commends  them to the  Governments  of the several    parts of the Empire.*   * The texts  of the Agreements between  the United  Kingdom and theDominions,  India and Southern Rhodosia are. given in  Appendices I to VII.Agreements to which the United Kingdom is not a party are not  included in the-present print.

         (b)  Resolutions regarding Customs Administration.    The Conference  recommends that the  aims  to  be kept in viewshould be :     (i) The avoidance of uncertainty as to the amount of duty which          would be payable on the arrival of goods in the  importing          country ;    (ii) The reduction of friction and delay to a minimum;    (iii) The  provision of facilities for the expeditious and effective          settlement of disputes  relating to all matters affecting the          application of the Customs Tariff;and  that any measures  which Customs Administrations might take to safeguard themselves  against evasion should  be consistent withthese principles.              (c)  Statement  regarding Commercial Relations with Foreign                                      Countries.              The Conference considered two broad groups of questions affecting          the commercial relations of the several members of  the  Common-          wealth  with  foreign countries.              In the first place,  the Conference discussed the general question          of the relationship  between inter-Commonwealth preferences and the          mo^t-favoured-nation  clause  in^commercial  treaties;  with  foreign         &quot;PojjfirsT  E^ic^government will deteniuTTe^lrs^parricular policy  in          dealing with this  matter,  but  the  representatives of the  various          Governments on the Committee stated that it was their policy that          no treaty obligations into which  they might enter  in the  future          should  be allowed  to  interfere with any  mutual  preferenceT^tlieh          Governments of the Commonwealth  might decide to accord to  eachJjJU     I  other, and that they  would free themselves froir^ existing trgaties,          if any, which might so interfere.  They would, STiact, take all the          steps necessary to implement and  safe-guard  whatever preferences          might be so granted.              In the second  place, attention  was drawn to recent  tendencies          in foreign countries to conclude regional agreements between them-          selves for the mutual accord of preferences  which were  designed          as being  exclusive, and not to be extended to countries which  were          not parties to, or did  not adhere to the agreements.   On this point,          there  was a general  agreement that foreign countries which had          existing treaty obligations  to  grant  most-favoured-nation  treatment          to  the products of particular parts  of the  Commonwealth  could not          be allowed to  override  such obligations by regional  agreements  of          the character  in question.  Particular reference  was  made in this          connection to the question of the Danubian States in regard to which          preferential  treatment was  in contemplation  for  the  cereal exports          of  the States  concerned exports   which  constitute  a  substantial          proportion of the  world&apos;s exports of the  cereals  in question.  The          Conference  were,  however, informed  that  in  the discussion which          took  place at Lausanne on the matter, the rights of third countries          had,  at the instance of the United Kingdom, been expressly reserved.              The Conference recognized that the fact that rights are accorded          by most-favoured-nation  treatment  does  not preclude  a foreign           country from  seeking the consent  of the  various  Governments  of           the British Commonwealth to  the waiver of their  rights in particular          cases, and that these Governments must be guided by consideration          of their individual interests in deciding whether or not to meet the           wishes of the  foreign country concerned,  so  long, however,  as the           general principle that rights of this kind  cannot be arbitrarily with-           drawn is  fully and  carefully  preserved.              The Conference would,  however, recommend  that where  two or           more Commonwealth Governments share a common interest  in any           proposal  for the  waiver  of  particular  treaty rights, they  should           consult together with a view to arriving, in  so  far as possible, at           a common policy.
(d) Resolutions  and Statements regarding  Monetary  and Financial                            Questions.                                I.   (a) A risejtawKjhput the world in the genei-aljejvejs^oi whole-sale  prices Is^nTTne  hagnesT^ulgTeTTle^irarjT^   &quot;The  evil of fallingprides-&quot; must be  attacked  by Government and  individual action inall its causes,  whether political, economic, financial or monetary.   (b) For  dealing with  the  problem  in  its  widest  aspects  theGovernments represented at this Conference record their conviction that international action is urgently necessary,  and announce their desire  to co-operate with  other nations in any  practicable measures for raising wholesale  prices.   (c) The Conference has considered what action  can be taken bythe nations of the Commonwealth to help towards raising prices.   As regards monetary factors, the Conference recognizes  that thecentral position of the United Kingdom, not only among the countries of the Commonwealth but in  world trade  and  finance,  makes  theUnited Kingdom a main factor in anything that can be  done.   TheConference, therefore, welcomes the  following statement made onbehalf  of  the  United   Kingdom  by   the   Chancellor  of  theExchequer:        &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government desire  to see wholesale sterling   prices  rise.   The best condition  for this would be a rise hi  gold   prices, and the absence of a rise  in gold prices inevitably&quot;imposes   limitations on what can be done  for sterling.  A rise in  prices   cannot be effected by monetary action alone, since various other   factors which have combined to bring about the present depression   must also  be modified or removed before a remedy  is  assured.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  nevertheless,  recognize   that  an   amplesunpij^f  short-term money  at, Jow^j^ates may have a   valuabTennfluenceT*ana trTey^are^onfident that the efforts which   have successfully brought about  the present favourable monetary   conditions  can and will, unless  unforeseen difficulties arise, be   continued.&quot;   (d) The  Conference  recommends  the  other  countries  of  theCommonwealth  represented here to act in  conformity with  the  lineof policy  as set  out  in  the  statement  of the  Chancellor of  theExchequer, so far as lies within their  power.   In the monetary  sphere the primary line  of action towards a.rise  in  prices  should be the creation and  maintenance, within thelimits  of  sound  finance,  of such  conditions as will assist in  the revival  of  enterprise  and  trade.  Among  these conditions  ar^&amp;Jow,rate^jif^^njkerest and  an  abundance of  short-term money.   Whileregard must be hacTHoTM &quot;&quot;different conditioni^spplying to various.types of loans,  the rate  of interest  for all purposes should be  keptas low as financial  conditions  permit.   At the same  time it  is.necessary that  these favourable monetary conditions be achieved,not  by the inflationary creation of additional  means  of  payment to finance public  expenditure, but  by an  orderly monetary policy,safeguarded,  if  the necessity  should arise, by such steps as  willrestrain and circumscribe  the scope of violent speculative  movements in commodities or securities.   It must be kept in mind, however, that the  success of any suchpolicy  will be hampered  and  might be  nullified by  the failure tomodify  or  remove important non-monetary obstacles.  Of the non-monetary  factors which are depressing the level of prices many are-of international  character and  require  an  international  remedy.The  nations  of the Commonwealth should,  nevertheless,  take allsteps that lie in their power to increase public confidence, especiallyin the field of business enterprise,  and to facilitate trade.   (e) The  Conference recognizes  the great importance to traders.of stability of  exchange rates over as wide an area as possible.   Thecomplete  solution of this problem  must await  the  restoration of conditions for the satisfactory  working of an international standardas referred to  below.   In  the meanwhile, and  pending  such  a.solution, this Conference  has considered  the possibility of achievingvaluable results  in two  directions first by  creating  an  area of stability among countries  regulating their  currencies in  relation to sterling;  and  secondly,  by avoiding  wide day-to-day   fluctuations.between sterling and gold.     [7518]                                                B 2
    As regards  the latter, the Conference has noted with satisfaction that the United Kingdom has already  established machinery  aimed at preventing wide fluctuations in  the  gold value of sterling causedby  speculative  movements.   As  to  the  former,  the  Conferencerecognizes the  value  of the  countries  within  the Commonwealthwhose currencies are linked to sterling  maintaining  stability between their exchange rates  and looks to a  rise in the  general  level of wholesale prices as the  most desirable  means  for facilitating  this result.                               II.    The Conference  recognizes  that the  ultimate  aim of monetary policy  should  be  the  restoration  of  a satisfactory  international monetary standard.   Such  a standard  should  so  function as notmerely to maintain  stable exchange rates between all countries, butalso to ensure the smooth and efficient  working of the machineryof international trade  and finance.    This postulates international agreement among the great tradingnations of the world, and while certain of the States here representedhold  very definite  views on the  question of  the most  desirablestandard, the  Conference refrains from  making any  recommenda-tions on the  subject in view of the fact that  the question is shortly to be discussed at an international  conference.  There are,  however,several conditions precedent  to the re-establishment of any  inter-national monetary standard.  The most important among them are:a  rise  in  the  general  level of commodity  prices in  the various countries  to  a  height more in keeping with  the level  of  costs,including the burden of debt and other fixed and semi-fixed  charges;and an adjustment  of the factors  political, economic,  financial  and monetary, which have caused the breakdown of the gold  standardin many countries,  and which, if not adjusted, would inevitably leadto  another breakdown of whatever international standard  may beadopted.    It is also  in the view of the Conference of the utmost importanceto the future  working of  any international standard that international co--operation  should be  secured and   maintained  with  a  view to avoiding,  so  far  as  may be found practicable, wide fluctuations inthe purchasing power of  the standard of value. (e) Resolutions and  Statements regarding Methods  of Economic                           Co-operation.                      (i) General Resolutions.    This Conference,  having  discussed  the  question  of EconomicConsultation  and Co-operation within the  Commonwealth, and havingconsidered the annexed report* prepared for  it on the constitution and functions of existing agencies operating in  these fields :       Recommends that a committee should be appointed forthwith,    consisting of not more  than two representatives of each  of the    participating Governments, to consider the means of facilitating    economic  consultation  and  co-operation  between  the. several    Governments of the Commonwealth,  including  a  survey  of the    functions,  organization  and  financial  bases  of  the   agencies    specified  in the  annexed report, *   and an examination of what    alterations or modifications, if any,  in the existing machinery for    such co-operation within the Commonwealth are desirable.       The  Conference  further  recommends  that  it  shall  be  an    instruction  to the  Committee to elect their own Chairman from    among their members, and to report  to the several Governments    represented thereon not later than the 81st May next, with  a view    to the consideration  of  their report by the several Governments    not later  than September  1988.    The Conference was given to understand by the representatives ofthe United Kingdom that, in order that the necessary time  might beavailable for the preparation and consideration  of the report  of theCommittee concerning the existing and future machinery for  economic co-operation  within the Commonwealth,  the  Govei-nment  of the    * Appendix 6 to tho Report of the Committee on Methods of EconomioCo-oporation (not attached to tho present print).
United Kingdom would continue to furnish any funds which may berequired  to finance essential work of the Empire Marketing  Boarddown to  the  end of September  1983.    The Conference records itsdeep appreciation of the action of the United Kingdom in this respect.   With  regard to the above recommendations reservations were madeby Mr. Havenga, for the Union of South Africa, and by Mr. Lemass,for the Irish  Free State, respectively,  in the following terms :        (Mr.  Havenga):  &quot;While  not  wishing  to  object  to  the   acceptance  of   the  report  of  the Committee  on  Methods of   Economic Co-operation,  I desire,  in order to remove any ground   for misapprehension,  to record  the following reservations on   behalf of the Union of South Africa :       &quot;1. While not generally adverse to the institution of ad hoc   bodies for economic investigation and  preparation,  the  Union   Government  will  not  associate itself with  any scheme for the   erection  of any organization   in the  nature of a  permanent   secretariat or  preparatoiy  committee to  Commonwealth  Con-   ferences, whether economic  or otherwise.       &quot;2. That  portion  of the report  which  introduces the draft   resolutions relating to the appointment of a Committee to consider   the means of  facilitating economic consultation and co-operation,   must  not be  read in  the  sense that the Union Government  is   committed in principle to give financial support to Commonwealth   Economic Organizations.&quot;       (Mr.  Lemass): &quot;I do  not object  to the adoption of  this   report and the accompanying resolutions,  but I wish it to be made   perfectly clear in the published records of the Conference that the   Government of  the Irish Free  State  are  not prepared to contem-   plate  the setting  up of  an Impei-ial Economic Secretariat or of   any similar organ of centralization.&quot;       (ii) Resolution concerning  Industrial Standardization.   I. The Conference recommends that, with a view to assisting theco-ordination of the work of national standardization,  the following principles, as far as practicable, be observed  :   (a) That the specifications should  be in accordance with the needs          of  industry and fulfil a  generally recognized want:   (h) That the community interest of producer and consumer  should          be maintained throughout;   (c) That the specifications should be arrived at by general consent:   (d) That  periodical  review and revision should be undertaken to          prevent crystallization and keep  the specifications abreast          of progress;   (c) That full information regarding the initiation of any specifica-          tion and  progress in its preparation should, without  delay,          be circulated by the  originating body to the corresponding          bodies in other parts of the Commonwealth.   II. Having regard to the disadvantages which are apt  to occurwhen a statutory provision embodies a standard specification verbatim,whether  in whole or in part, instead of confining itself to a referenceto a  national standard specification, the Conference recommends that each Government  of the Commonwealth  in co-operation  with itscentral standardizing body, should bring under review the position with  regard  to such statutory provisions, in  order  that it may bepossible  to keep these standards in line with industrial and scientificprogress  without the necessity of fresh legislation.   III. With a view to facilitating the general adoption of standardspecifications throughout the Commonwealth, the Conference  recom-mends that  the  Governments  concerned take  into  favourable  con-sideration the provision of  free entry to standard specifications andother documents  circulated between the central standardizing bodies.   IV. In order  to provide the various parts  of the Commonwealthwith  an  accurate means  of exchange of colour information and  tosecure a  basic standard in trade practice, the Conference recommends that each central standardizing body should at an early date considerthe issue of a standard schedule of colours.
s   V. As an immediate step towards the promotion of intra-Common-wealth trade through the adoption  of commercial  standard  speeifica-tions, the Conference recommends  that, in respect of steel, timber,industrial chemical  products  and  replaceable parts  of agricultural implements  and machinery, immediate  steps be taken by the centralstandardizing bodies in those parts  of the Commonwealth affected tosecure a greater degree of uniformity in  standard specifications  andtrade practices.   VI.  With a view to the employment  of common standard specifica-tions for aircraft materials and component parts, and  particularly themethod of testing  therein specified, the Conference recommends thatthe national standardizing bodies in those parts of the Commonwealthparticularly  concerned, should  co-operate directly with  this  object in view.   VII. The Conference, taking note of the observation contained inthe last paragraph of the Eeport of the Conference  on  Standardizationaccepted by the  Imperial  Conference of  1980, which  reads  asfollows :        &apos;&apos; Apart from day to day  consideration of matters of detail, we   are  impressed with the desirability  of readier means of consulta-   tion on questions of policy than are afforded by  the past, or by   occasional conferences such as the present,&quot;is impressed with  the  desirability of  obviating the  difficulties  and delays which inevitably occur  under existing conditions in conductingconsultations between the central standardizing bodies in  the various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the misunder-standings which occasionally arise  due to the distances between thecorrespondents and to the subject matter of the communications.   The Conference recommends that for  the  purpose of maintainingcloser liaison in these matters the central standardizing bodies in thedifferent parts of the Commonwealth  should be  authorised to calltogether, periodically or otherwise,  representatives in their respective countries of the corresponding bodies, or persons otherwise designatedfor the purpose.    The Conference further suggests that such an  arrangement might include  a provision whereby the  Trade  Commissioners  maintained in  different parts of the  Empire by the  several  commonwealth governments  should, as occasion  requires,  be  available  to  act asLiaison Officers  for this purpose.   The  Conference considers  thatit should be made  clear that such consultations  are purely supple-mentary to, and not intended  in any  way to supplant,  the methodof  direct communication  already  established  between  the centralstandardizing bodies.        (iii)  Grading and  Standards of Agricultural  Prodticts.    The report of the Sub-Committee  on this subject, which is setforth as Appendix 2 to the Report of  the Committee on Methods ofEconomic Co-operation, was  approved  b3&apos; the Conference.         (iv) Resolutions concerning Industrial  Co-operation.    This Conference, having  examined the  Report  of the ImperialEconomic   Committee  on  Imperial Industrial  Co-operation, findsitself in general agreement with the tenor of the Report.    The Report  makes  it   clear   that  industrial  production has developed  and will  continue  to develop in the less industrializedparts  of the  Commonwealth.   These  developments  involve  changes in the economic  structure both of the  more industrialized  and of the less industrialized  countries;  and  the  Conference notes  with approval the  view of the Committee that:  &apos;&apos; the object  of co-opera- tion is not, and must not be, to arrest change, but wisely to direct and facilitate its  course.&quot;    It should, in the opinion of the Conference, be the object of any policy  of industrial co-operation within the Commonwealth  to secure the best division  of industrial  activities  among the  several parts of the Commonwealth and  the  ordered  economic development of  each part, with a view to ensuring the maximum efficiency and economy of production  and distribution.
   It is further the view of the  Conference that  the precise nature and  extent  of the co-operation  to be  achieved  in any  particular industry  must largely  depend upon effective  consultation  between those engaged,  or proposing to engage,  in that industry in any two or more parts of the Commonwealth.   The Conference therefore recommends to the various  industries in which conditions are suitable  for the purpose, the desirability ofmaking arrangements  for such  consultation at the earliest possible date; but it  records its belief  that  such consultation, to be fully effective, should be conducted between  responsible persons  or bodiesadequately  representative  of the  industry in  each  part of  theCommonwealth concerned.   The  Conference further  recommends   that  the  Governmentsconcerned facilitate and assist  such consultations  by all  availablemeans.   The Conference further recommends that, without prejudice totheir  liberty to determine  their own general economic policies,  theGovernments  of   the  Commonwealth  should   give   sympathetic consideration to any proposals which may be directed towards giving effect to  the principle  of industrial co-operation  and which may  beput before them by responsible parties representing similar industrial interests  in  the   parts of  the   Commonwealth  affected.    In thisconnection the Conference would draw  attention  to  the importanceof taking into consideration the  interests  of other  parts of  theCommonwealth which  might  be  affected by such proposals.           (v) Resolution  concerning Films and Radio.   The Conference takes note of the  suggestions contained in  theReport upon Films and Radio submitted to  it  by the Committee  on methods  of  Economic  Co-operation,4&quot; and commends them for  theconsideration of the Governments represented at the Conference.                (vi) Subsidised   Foreign Shipping.   The   Conference  adopted   the  following  confidential  report submitted  to  it  by  the   Committee   on   Methods  of  economic co-operation :    (1) In the trade between North  America, Fiji, New Zealand and          Australia  damage has been   caused  to the British line          which has operated these  services for a long  period  by          the incursion into the  trade  of  a foreign line heavily          subsidised by its Government.  The position  is aggravated          by the fact that the British line is excluded from the trade          between  Honolulu and San  Francisco, which is reserved          as a coasting trade,  while foreign  ships  are  allowed to          share in the trade between Australia and New Zealand.   (2) In the view of  the  Sub-Committee subsidised competition of          this  kind constitutes  a dumping  of services.   The Sub-          Committee   recalled  the  terms   of  the  resolution   on          Imperial Economic Defence adopted  by the 1928 Imperial          Economic Conference,  and considered  a possible method          of dealing with  the matter  referred  to in  the  preceding          paragraph.   They feel, however,  that  the  application of          any such method might  have important repercussions  on          Empire  shipping  in other directions, and that the extent          of  these  repercussions  should  be  fully and  carefully          examined before any action is decided on.   (8) The  Sub-Committee therefore recommend that the question          be referred for full examination to the representatives in          London  of each of the Governments  represented on  the          Sub-Committee.   (4) The  Sub-Committee  further recommend that no reference to          the subject be made in  the  published proceedings of  the          Imperial Economic Conference.   * Appendix u to  the Report of the Committee  on  Methods of economic co-oporation (not attached to the present print).

Copy  of  iYofc  scut  to Prime  Minister  of Canada  by Mr.  llunciman  on   August 19, 1932, in connection with Article  17  of the above Agreement.                      (1)  Exchange  Dumping  Duty.          (2) Par  Valuation  of Goods for  Customs  Duly Purposes.   The  United Kingdom  Delegation  have already  called the  attention of theCanadian  Government  to  two  matters  in relation  to exchange  rates  whichare of great importance  to  the exporting interests in  the  United  Kingdomand on  which  numerous complaints have  been received :    (1) the special exchange  dumping duty  imposed on  goods imported  from          the United  Kingdom which are of a class or kind made in Canada;   (2) the employment of  the  par  rate  of  exchange  for  the  purpose of          ascertaining  the value  for customs  duty  purposes  of goods  imported          from  the United Kingdom.The  effects  of  the special  exchange  dumping duty  in the case  of  goodsentering  under  the British  Preferential  Tariff  is  the imposition of a  dutyin excess of that  levied on  goods from  countries  on  the  gold  standardamounting to  the full  difference  between  their  value  at  the  fixed  figureof $4-40  to the   sterling and  their value at tho current  rate of exchange.   It has also  to be  borne in mind that  by virtue of  recent agreements the special  exchange  dumping  duty is  not applied   to goods imported  intoCanada  from Australia and  New Zealand,  though the currencies  of  thoseDominions  are  depreciated  to  a  greater extent  than  that of  the UnitedKingdom.   The  United Kingdom Delegation, while  prepared  to  admit that   some justification may be found for measures of this kind at  the time  of  a suddenand  considerable  variation  in  exchange  rates,  feel  that   this  justificationgradually  disappears as prices adjust  themselves to the new levels  of exchange.They  have taken note of Mr.  bennett&apos;s assurance that it is not the  intentionof the Canadian Government that the duty should  become a permanent burden on the  trade of the  United  Kingdom, as would be the  case, for example, ifCanadian  currency were linked to  sterling,  and they think  that the  time hasnow arrived  when provision might be made for the reduction of the amountof the special duty by stages with a view  to its ultimate abolition.   They  have  considered  the  scheme  proposed in the  paper handed by  thePrime Minister to Mr. Runciman, but feel that it would be  an unsatisfactoryscheme.  In their opinion the  simplest  method  would be   that the presentfixed  rate of  $4-40  to the    sterling, which is employed  for calculating tbeamount of duty, should be reduced  at once  by, say,  20 cts.  and  at  intervals of,  say,  three  months  by  further amounts of lOets.,  until  the  differencebetween  the fixed and current rates  disappeared.   As regards the second matter mentioned  above, i.e., the  application  of  the far rate of exchange  for the  purpose of assessing the value of  United  kingdom goods  for Customs  duty  purposes,  tho  United  Kingdom  Delegation  would urge that the Canadian Government should now revert to the normal practiceof calculating  values  at  the current  rate of exchange.   Whilst the right  of Canada  to  safeguard her  revenue  is  fully recognised,it is  submitted that  any steps taken to  this  end should  not result in  theapplication  to  United Kingdom goods of  duties  of  which  the  ad  valoremincidence is higher than that  on goods  of  the  same real value imported from most  other countries.   The United  Kingdom  Delegation would  strongly  urge  that,  with a  viewto furthering the  objects for which the present Conference has been convened,the suggestions contained in this note should be given early  and sympathetic consideration by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.      Copy of Correspondence  relating  to  Section  43 of the Canadian                               Customs Act.   In response to our request Mr. Downie Stewart (Chairman of the Committeeon Customs Administration) authorised Dr. Craig to hand to me  confidentiallythe  enclosed  copy of correspondence on the subject of the  amendment ofSection 43 of the  Canadian Customs Act.  The copy  has been  given to  us onthe understanding that any subsequent reference to the matter is to be  basedupon the  reading  of  the letter at the meeting  of the Committee on  tho17th August,* and not upon  this correspondence.                                                (Sd.)    H. J. WILSON.   August 19, 1932.   * Minutes of Third Meeting  of Committee on Customs Administration (notattached).
                                        Minister  of National Revenue,My dear Mr.  Stewart,                           Canada,  August 15, 1932.   After leaving the meeting  of  tho Committee on  Customs Administrationthis  afternoon I have  communicated with  the Government  of  Canada,  andhappily I think am now  in  a  position on their behalf  to  make  the  followingproposal :    The Government of Canada arc prepared to take  appropriate  measures atan early opportunity to so amend  Section 48 of the Customs Act, which  wasunder  consideration this  afternoon, as to provide that the operations of theSection shall not apply  to goods which are entitled to  entry under the BritishPreferential tariff or any lower tariff.   Of  course this will touch  all phases of the legislation which are of interestto the  United Kingdom and the British Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates.   As  it will be readily appreciated by the Committee,  it  is necessary  forme to  say  that  there must be  no publicity given to this proposal, and under-taking, and  the report of  the Committee,  so  far at  least  as  this  item isconcerned,  should not  be made  public until the matter  is submitted to the parliament  of  Canada.                                              I have,  &amp;c.                                        (Sgd.)    E. S. RYCKMAN,                                           Minister of National Revenue.   The Hon.  W.  Downie Stewart,      Chairman of  the Committee on         Customs Administration,            Ottawa.My dear Mr.  Ryckman,                                  August 18, 1932.   I have  to  thank you for your letter of the 15th instant.  I note that your government is prepared to take appropriate measures  at  an early opportunityto so amend  Section  43 of the Canadian Customs Act as to provide that theoperation  of the  Section shall  not  apply  to goods  which  are entitled to entryunder the  British Preferential  Tariff or any  lower tariff.   As arranged with  you,  the  letter  was read to the Customs  Committee  andthe Secretariat was requested  to place it confidentially on  the file so that no publicity  would occur  till after your Parliament  had  had an opportunity ofdealing  with the matter.   The  British  delegates  on  the Committee  expressed  their  appreciation ofyour action.                                           Yours faithfully,                                      (Sgd.)    W. DOWNIE STEWART.   The  Hon.  E. B.  Ryckman, M.P.,      Minister of National Revenue,         Ottawa, Canada.               Committee  on Customs Administration (No. 2).Dear  Dr.  Skelton,                                        August 18, 1932.   I  enclose  herewith a  letter which  was  addressed  to  me  by  the  Hon.Mr.  Ryckman on the  15th  August,  which I  have read  to the  members ofthe Committee on  Customs  Administration who  were present  at the meetingheld  on  the 17th August.

The present wholesale prices of  frozen meat are at a level  which hasresulted in grave depression in the livesToelt^rtraustries of the United Kingdom.and  the  Dominions.  This depression is  likely, if continued, to bring abouta serious decline in production and consequent ultimate injury to the consumer..   2.  Such a position  is so serious that it is essential to  take whatever steps;may appear feasible to  raise  the  wholesale prices of frozen meat in the UnitedKingdom  market to such a  level as will maintain efficient  production.   3.  &quot;With a  view to  the  earliest possible improvement  of the position, His;Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the United Kingdom will,  during the currency  ofthe Ottawa Agreement, arrange for the regulation of importations  of meat intothe United Kingdom, the regulation, in  view ot the clos^ttileraKlulionship  ofall  kinds of  meat  in determining  the  price level, to  be applied  to all the-meats  referred  to in Section 5.   4.  The policy of His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  United  Kingdom  in.relation to meat production  is,  first, to secure  development of home produc-tion, and, secondly, to give  to the Dominions  an expanding share  of imports.into the  United  Kingdom.   5.  In order to co-operate  with His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the UnitedKingdom in  the carrying out of this  policy,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  in.the Commonwealth  of  Australia  agrees  to limit the export of frozen mutton?and  lamb to the United Kingdom for the year  1933 to an amount equivalentto the  total imports from Australia during the year ended the 30th June, 1932,.in consideration  of the United  Kingdom  Government    (a)  Arranging for the  regulation of the  importation  of  foreign  meat  in          accordance with a programme  (hereinafter referred  to as the &quot; agreed          programme &quot;)  agreed  between  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the-          United Kingdom  and  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  Common-          wealth  of  Australia  and including  within its scope Frozen Mutton.          and  Lamb, Frozen Beef and Chilled  Beef.   (6)  Arranging,  as  soon as possible after receiving the Report  of  the  Corn-         mission now  sitting  on the  reorganisation of the  Pig  Industry  in         the United  Kingdom, for the quantitative regulation of  the supplies         of bacon and hams coming on  to the United  Kingdom  market.   (c)  Undertaking that  no restriction  will  be placed  upon the  importation        . of any meat from Australia during the period named in the agreed         programme  referred  to  in  Section  5 (a-)  of this  Declaration.   6.  During  the year 1933 and in the  light of the experience  gained, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the  United Kingdom will consider, in  consultation.with His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the Commonwealth  of Australia, the best.means  of ensuring an improved price situation and the more  orderly marketing;of supplies.   7.  Should no permanent policy be agreed upon  as the result of the consul-tation  referred to above, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the  United Kingdom;undertakes, after  the  expiry of the  period named  in the  agreed programmereferred  to in  Section 5  (a) of this Declaration and during the remainder  ofthe period of the Agreement concluded at Ottawa    (a)  To arrange for the  continuance, unless otherwise agreed  between the-         Governments concerned, of the  regulation of  tho  imports of foreign.         meat at the rates in force at the  end of the period named in the         agreed programme.   (6)  In any  action affecting the imports of meat into the  United Kingdom         which the  United  Kingdom Government  may  take on  behalf  of         United  Kingdom  agriculture, to have regard  to the  policy  set out.         in Section 4 hereof.   8.  Should it  appear to  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom-.after onquiry  that, at any  time  in consequence of  a restriction  upon foreignimports, the  supplies of meat of any kind are inadequate to meet the require-ments  of consumers in the United Kingdom,  then  His Majesty&apos;s  Government.may remove any such restriction until supplies are again adequate.SCHEDULE H.DECLARATION BY UNITED  KINGDOM GOVERNMENT.[7518]

With reference  to our conversations on the question  of the tariff treatmentof canned pineapple of Colonial origin in Canada, I  desire to advise you thatthe Australian Delegation will not raise any objection to  the proposal submittedby  you  that  the Canadian Government should reduce the duty  on cannedpineapple of  Colonial  origin to 1  cent per pound.

            Copy  of letter referred  to in Article 4 of Agreement.                                     New Zealand Delegation,Dear  Mr. Baldwin,                      Ottawa,  Canada, August 19, 1932.   I HAVE given further consideration to the matter of an agreement between his Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  in New  Zealand.   In  my conversations with you and  your Ministerswe  have agreed that a policy will  be  adopted that will  have  for its  definiteobjective the two-fold  purpose of raising the price of meat to  a remunerativelevel and of progressively increasing the share of the Dominions in the  UnitedKingdom market.  I accept your undertaking that  effective steps will be takento secure these results.   2.   For the  purpose  of restricting  foreign  supplies of mutton and  lamb,the arrivals,  as compared with the corresponding  periods of the  year  ending the 30th June, 1932,  as  I understand  the  United Kingdom proposal,  are tobe reduced by at  least 10 per cent, for the  quarter ending the  31st  March,1933,  15 per cent, for the quarter  ending the 30th June, 1933, 20 per cent.for  the  quarter ending the 30th September,  1933, 25 per  cent,  for the quarterending  the 31st December,   1933,  30  per  cent, for the  quarter  ending  the31st March,  1934, and 35  per cent,  for  the quarter  ending  the  30th June,1934,  and  thereafter, unless  otherwise  agreed between  the Governments con-cerned,  for the remainder of the period  of the agreement concluded  at  Ottawaby not  less than 35  per cent.   3.   During  the year 1933,  and in  the  light of the experience gained,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will consider,  in consultationwith His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  New Zealand,  the  best means of ensuringan  improved price situation  and the more orderly  marketing of supplies.   4.   To  assist in  the orderh- marketing of  supplies  the Dominion will givea reliable estimate of  shipments of mutton and lamb as early as possible ineach  export  season.  This   season  will  necessarily  cover  the period  the1st October in one  year to  the 30th September in the  following year.   Forthe season 1932-33  we estimate our exports of frozen mutton and lamb at200,000 tons,  with a 5 per cent, increase in each of the following two years.For the calendar  year 1933  you may  take  it that our  shipments of frozenmutton and lamb  will be the same as those of the twelve months  ended the30th June, 1932,  i.e., of the  year which  ended with  the month  immediately preceding the opening of the conference.   5.   It is understood that,  in  consideration  of this undertaking  on our part,no  restriction  will  be  placed by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in the  UnitedKingdom upon the  importation  of  any meat  from New  Zealand during  theperiod ending the 30th June,  1934.   6.   In  frozen  beef, we estimate our  exports  for  the season  1932-33 atnot more than  22,000 tons, representing a maximum increase over the previousseason  of approximately  10  per cent.   7.   With  regard to bacon and  other  pig products,  I am informed that your  Government are now dealing with  the  reorganisation  of this industry,and that an  effective policy  of control of foreign imports will  be adopted.This policy, as I understand  it,  will provide for some  expansion of Home  and dominion  supplies of  pig products. New Zealand  is already  an  exporter of pork and bacon carcases and will be  granted a reasonable share of the expansionmade possible  by  the  reduction of foreign imports.   8.   All frozen  beef (carcases  and boned beef) from  foreign  sources is to besubject  to the same reductions  as  are  specified in paragraph 2.   9.   No increase of chilled beef imports  from foreign sources  into the  UnitedKingdom in excess of  the twelve months the 1st July, 1931,  to the 30th June,1932, will be  permitted  during the period January 1933 to  the  30th June,1934, and  tho  rate of importation will  not  thereafter be  increased during theperiod  of the Ottawa  agreement except with the  concurrence  of the  Govern-ments  concerned.    10.   Should it  appear  to His  Majesty&quot;s Government in the United Kingdomafter  an enquiry that,  at  any  time, in consequence of a restriction upon foreignimports, the supplies of meat of any kind are inadequate to  meet the require-ments of consumers in the United  Kingdom,  then His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmay  remove any  such restriction until supplies are again  adequate.                                                    Yours  sincerely,                                               (Signed)    J.  G. COATES.    The  Bight  Hon. Stanley  Baldwin,  M.P..

Parliament  Buildings,Dear Mr. Havenga,                              Ottaxva, August  18, 1932.   IN the course of our discussions with you on the subject of trade betweentho  United  Kingdom  and  the  Union   we  have  given  consideration  totho question of the  marketing of  chilled  beef  from South Africa.  For thereasons that have been explained to you, we think  the  matter  should be  dealtwith,  not by means of a duty  on chilled beef from  foreign  sources,  but aspart of the  general arrangements for  the  regulation of the supplies of  meat to the United Kingdom which will, it is hoped,  emerge from the consultationsthat  it is proposed to arrange during  1933  with the  Dominions.   Should&apos; any practical difficulty be experienced in  arranging for the actualmarketing of the beef from South Africa,  it will no doubt be possible to make arrangements with the shippers  of  chilled  beef from South American  sources,and  His Majesty&apos;s  Government in tho United Kingdom undertake, if necessary,to use their good  offices with  a view to bringing this about.                                              Yours sincerely,                                       (Signed)    STANLEY BALDWIN.   The Hon. N. C.  Havenga, M.P.

I thank you  for your letter of the 18th instant in regard to the  marketing of chilled beef from  South Africa.   We have noted  and appreciate the  diffi-culties of His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the  United Kingdom in connectionwith  the  imposition  of  a duty  on this commodity.  The  undertaking  givenby you on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to use the good  offices of that  Government with  the shippers from South Americansources to facilitate the marketing in order  to enable South  African producersto obtain  a share of the United Kingdom market at present held by  them will,however,  prove of real benefit and I accept it as part of the trade agreement,at present being entered  into between our  Governments.                                                  Yours sincerely,                                           (Signed)    N.  0. HAVENGA.   The Rt.  Hon.

Copy  of  Secret Note initialled by  Sir  Horace Wilson and Sir Atid Chatterjee                            on August 19, 1932.   The  following  note deals with certain  matters on  which  agreement  hasbeen  reached  in  the course of discussion between  the  United  Kingdom  and indian Delegations, but which are not covered  by the formal  Agreement in contemplation between the two Governments :    The  first relates to iron and  steel.  Under  the Agreement  the UnitedKingdom  Government  are  undertaking to continue after  the loth Novemberfree entry to  all classes of  Indian goods covered by the  Import  Duties Act.While, of course,  the  Agreement will continue in force  unless it is denouncedafter  six  months&apos;  notice,  the maintenance of  free  entry  for  iron  and  steelduring a  longer period than six months from the date  of  the  agreement hasalways been regarded  on both sides  as part of an understanding which  wouldprovide for satisfactory conditions in regard to the tariff treatment of galvanisedsheets on importation into India.  The conditions which have  been discussed and which  would  be satisfactory to the United  Kingdom Government are asfollows :    On the  basis  of present selling prices the duties  would be  adjusted asfollows :    30 rupees per ton on United Kingdom sheets made from Indian sheet bars.   53 rupees per  ton  on United Kingdom  sheets made from any sheet bars.   83 rupees per  ton on foreign sheets.   In  the  event  of a  further fall  in the  price of continental  sheets,  theGovernment of India  would, as soon  as  it was satisfied that  a fall in pricehad in fact occurred, impose promptly by notification and without an enquiry by the Tariff Board an additional  duty of 10 rupees per ton, it being under-stood  that,  if the   imposition of this  increased  duty resulted  in  an  increasein the price of  sheets in India,  it would be  open to the Government ofIndia to  remove the additional  duty.   It  is  understood that in case  a  satisfactory  arrangement is made  in thecase of galvanised sheets  such arrangement is  to remain in force only  untiLaction is taken by the  Government  of  India  following the  next  statutoryTariff enquiry in  India into the iron  and steel industry.   The second matter  relates  to yarns and piece goods made  of  cotton,  and artificial  silk, in  regard  to which the Government of  India  have given  an assurance that  the difference between  any protective duties  which they  invitethe Legislature to impose on United Kingdom and foreign  goods  respectivelywill  not   be less  than any difference in  the  amount  of protection required.as determined  on the  consideration  of the report of the  Tariff Board.(Int.)H.
