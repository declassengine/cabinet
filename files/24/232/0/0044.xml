Reports by Local Governments on the Political  Situation in India.   I circulate for the information of my colleagues the latest weekly reports from theLocal Governments iu India.                                                                        S.  H.     INDIA OFFICE,31st August 1932.Government  of India.   Another  quiet week.   Dr. Kitchlew has been  sentenced  to  two years&apos; rigorousimprisonment and fine under section 17,  Special  Powers Ordinance, for disobeyingorder under  section 4.   On preliminary reports received from Local Governments, which will be sent by airmail, following is a general appreciation of the reception of the Communal Award :    (1)  Muslims are generally privately  well pleased in all Provinces, though publiclyoffering some protest  as  offset to Hindu  demands.   In Bengal, for instance, theydemand statutory majority of  whole Council.    All-India Muslim Conference, Delhi,.expresses  disappointment at  Award being short  of Muslim  demands in regard to statutory majority in Punjab and Bengal, reduced  weightage  in some Provinces andundue weightage of non-Muslims in Frontier Province.   (2)  Caste Hindus,  especially  in  Bengal,  condemn  the  Award,  and  BengalGovernment anticipate that  Hindu agitation  will intensify.    Bombay reports thatHindus generally will condemn it.   Jayakar has called it deplorably reactionary.  InMadras  the  Award  is  in accordance with  general expectations  as  it  follows therecommendation of  Provincial Franchise  Committees.   Considerable body  favouracceptance, but extremists condemn it.   In United Provinces, Hindus resent decision as it affects Punjab and Bengal, but Sapru&apos;s attitude has created impression.   (3)  Depressed Classes are reported to be satisfied in Bengal and Central Provinces.Madras reports that the method of representation is regarded as anomalous.  Bombayreports  that Rajah&apos;s party  disapprove, and also  Ambedkar, but latter appears todisapprove on  the ground that representation is inadequate, and some disappointmentis also expressed on this  ground in the Central Provinces.  Other  Provinces do notreport about Depressed Classes, who, so far  as they are interested, may be presumedto be satisfied.   (4)  Local Governments generally do not  refer to question  of  women,  but  Madras-reports that  communal electorates for women excites criticism.   (5)  Sikh  Council  have condemned Award, and threaten rejection of constitution.[See  below]   (6)  Generally, reception of Award is on the lines anticipated.   There appears to&apos;be good body of public opinion prepared to work constitution on the basis&apos;of  Award,.but Hindu agitation may  intensify, directed rather against the Government than othercommunities.  The mass of population is indifferent, and there are no signs of dangerof communal disturbance outside the Punjab.   Following report has been received from the Punjab Government.  &quot; Muslimcommunity generally is not dissatisfied and willing to work the Award.  Politically-minded iirban Sikhs  are  protesting vigorously and endeavouring to arouse sympathyin rural areas, both by representing Award as creating Muslim Raj, and by preachinga  revival of Sikhism.  The support forthcoming  is,  so  far, limited and subject tofactions, but religious colour given to agitation is causing anxiety.   Moderate Sikhsadvocate  constitutional  methods.    Urban  Hindus are stimulating Sikhs towardsorganised resistance,  and Congress similarly are stimulating  them  towards civildisobedience.  Politically-minded urban caste Hindus profess  strong disaffection, but have, as yet, formulated no programme beyond supporting Sikh  opposition.   Amongthe Hindus and Sikhs a proposal is  gaining  ground  to apply for  continuance  of the1171    60  8.32
 present  constitution until a mutually acceptable  solution is found.  We anticipate that, if such, proposal materialises, there will be  opposition from the Punjabi Muslims and Hindus elsewhere.&quot; Delhi.    There  is nothing  special  to report.
