Ovey (Moscow).(No. 508.).Sir,                                         Foreign Office, July 28, 1932.    IN the course, of a conversation which I had with the Soviet Commissar forForeign Affairs at Geneva on the 21st July, M. Litvinov referred to the adverse balance of Anglo-Russian trade.  That adverse balance could, he observed, onlybe corrected in one of two ways, either by increasing exports or decreasing imports.The United Kingdom would not gain by decreasing imports from Russia, forthings imported from there were necessary to us.  He therefore  urged that thealternative remedy of increasing British exports to Russia should be applied, and said that Russia was prepared to increase the volume of orders placed in Englandif increased  credits were forthcoming.    2.  I told M. Litvinov that the adverse balance in our trade with Russia hadbeen causing us grave concern, and that it had been the subject of close examina-tion by some of my Cabinet colleagues and myself.  Inasmuch as our purchases from Russia we*re paid for in cash, it followed that Russia had at her disposal inBritish banks  very considerable sums which might  be used to purchase british goods.   Instead of this, these sums were transferred abroad,  very largely toGermany. Was not this a direction in which an improvement could be effected ?    3.  M. Litvinov replied that the money was  transferred to Germany not topay cash for purchases  there, but to meet bills  which represented even longercredits. He  therefore did not consider a change was possible in this respect, buthe reiterated his view that the real remedy was to be found in an enlargement and extension of credit.                                                   I am, &amp;c.                                                         JOHN SIMON.[526 ee-1]
