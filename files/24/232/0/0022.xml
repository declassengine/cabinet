inTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1932.,SECRET.                                                  Copy No.  QCP.  272  (32):                                CABINET.NOTE  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  AIR  ON  AIR                   DISARMAMENT  POLICY.    1.   THE first phase of the Disarmament Conference ended on the 24th July,1932, and the time has now come to review the situation, take stock of the results,and consider future policy.    2.   The Conference opened on the 2nd February, in an atmosphere of doubtand expectancy.  It is, I think, not too much to say that no country had, at thattime, a clear and  practical disarmament policy.  No solutions had been found tothe fundamental  problems resulting from the military inequalities of the peace treaties, yet everyone must  have realised that there could  be  no satisfactory settlement of the real problems of disarmament while major political issues ofthis nature remained undetermined.  I do not desire to labour this point unduly.It is proved, and emphasised, by the fact that, in nearly six months of debate and negotiation, it has not been considered possible to grapple with the vital questionof the numerical  limitation  of armaments,  despite the prolonged labours of thePreparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference,  which had resultedin a comprehensive draft Disarmament  Convention lacking only the additionof the essential figures.    3.   It soon became evident that  there was  general reluctance to deal  withthe real  problems of the reduction and limitation of armaments,  for fear thatdirect  approach  to  these all-important questions  would lead  to acrimoniousdiscussion which might have wrecked the Conference at its beginning.  In thesecircumstances,  it is not surprising that  little has been achieved as regards thereduction of land and naval  armaments, and practically  nothing as regards thelimitation of effectives.  The problems of numerical limitation were deferreo for future  consideration, and the Conference welcomed, with relief, the principle of&quot; qualitative &quot;  disarmament, as one which appeared to involve no majoi political difficulties.    4.   Such, in brief, were the circumstances in which attention became focussedupon  the possibility of  some  prohibitory  or qualitative  limitation  of airarmaments.   Any proposal of this nature was calculated to appeal to a number of    &apos;States.   The Powers who are prohibited from maintaining air forces, under theterms of the Peace Treaties,  were obviously anxious to see their  neighbours&apos; airforces  drastically limited or  totally  abolished.   The smaller  States have  noresponsibilities or overseas commitments which  are comparable  to those of thelarger  Powers  and, therefore, no scope  for the peace time employment of airforces.   They evidently considered,  and rightly so, that it would  be to  their advantage to abolish or limit their own insignificant and  inefficient air forces if,in return, they  could secure the abolition or limitation of the superior air forcesof the  great.Powers.    For  these obvious reasons, many States displayed greateagerness to classify air weapons,  along with chemical  and bacteriologicalweapons, as means of warfare which should  be abolished, or at any rate drasticallylimited in their power of action,  for humanitarian reasons.   The very fact thatthe demand of many States, for the  abolition or qualitative limitation of airforces, was put  forward on humanitarian  grounds made this demand  moredifficult  to deal with than.would, otherwise have been the case,  and created an atmosphere  which inevitably tended to obscure the real issues involved.

    5. &apos; The formal announcement of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, asregards air disarmament, was contained in the Declaration of British Disarma-ment  Policy (Qmd, 4122), which was made.early  in July.  The policy advocatedtherein was, in effect:-  .   I   (i) complete prohibition of all bombing from the air, save within,limits to ,  Ii, , \he laid down as precisely as possible by an international convention,     (ii), entire prohibition-of all air attack upon the civil population,  ,  (iii) a strict limitation in the unladen weight of all military  arid naval air-           craft, (troop carriers and flying boats excepted),     (iv) a restriction  in the numbers of all kinds of military and  naval aircraft.    6.  Subject only to  the  proviso that the proposed international convention should be  based on  reasonable  and  practicable  rules  for  the  restriction  of bombardment  to military objectives,  these  proposals  appeared to  me  to  beeminently practicable and desirable.  Moreover, they seemed likely to attain thetwo principal objects in  view, that is, the protection of the civil population andthe limitation of  national air forces to  actual  defence requirements. &apos; It soonbecame apparent, however, that some  of my  colleagues doubted whether  theseproposals were sufficient to satisfy  political exigencies at Geneva, mainly on thegrounds that the British proposals were not so sweeping as those which had beenput forward by some other countries.  Later in the same month, departure fromthe declared policy of the United Kingdom was indicated by the assent of our delegation to the Resolution which concluded the first stage of the DisarmamentConference.    7.  By assenting  to  this   resolution  our  Delegation  indicated   theiracquiescence in the proposal that &apos;         &quot; The High Contracting Parties  shall agree, as between themselves, that    all bombardment from the air  shall be abolished, subject to agreement with    regard to the measures to be adopted for the purpose of rendering effective    the observance of this rule.&quot;    8.  I feel compelled to point out, firstly, that the air policy envisaged in this resolution is entirely different from the only air policy which has been specificallyapproved by the Cabinet, i.e., the air disarmament policy contained in the BritishDeclaration of  Disarmament Policy;  and,  secondly,  that  the Resolution wasagreed to, in its present  terms, despite my insistent advice that grave dangers tothe defence of this country and of the Empire as a whole ai*e inseparable from  thepolicy advocated in the Resolution.    9.  The proposal, contained in the Resolution, that the High ContractingParties shall agree to abolish all air  bombardment &quot; as between  themselves &quot; is virtually  indistinguishable  from  a  previous proposal, emanating from  theForeign Office, for the prohibition of bombing &quot; on the territory and shipping ofsovereign States.&quot;  The Cabinet will remember that  the  latter proposal wasexhaustively examined by  a Ministerial Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, presided  over by the Lord President, who rejected it  on  thegrounds, inter alia,  that          &quot; ....  in the  overwhelming stress of a war which threatens the  life of     a Nation, no reliance can  be  placed on the  observance  of  artificial rules     of war;&quot;                                     and         &quot; The  proposed prohibition of the act of bombing on  the territory and     shipping of  another sovereign State  possesses considerable disadvantages     from  the point  of  view of Imperial defence generally, and  decisive dis-     advantages from  that of the defence of London  and other objectives to air     attack in the United Kingdom.&quot;   (CD. (B) 5 dated the 9th May, 1932.)     The report of the Sub-Committee was subsequently approved by the Cabineton the 11th May, 1932 (Cabinet 27 (32)), subject only to the investigation of  thepossibility of advocating total prohibition of all naval and military air  forces.Soundings as to this possibility showed that it had no chance of acceptance at theDisarmament Conference.  The Report of the Sub-Committee, therefore,  standsapproved.
     10:; From the point of view of the,air.defence of this country;, there appearsabsolutely:no reason, to. supppse. that a prohibition of ,air bonibardmeht enteredinto by the High; Contracting Parties  as between. tKemselws&apos;:&apos;- l.^ould possessany less &quot;decisive disadvantages&quot;  than a  prohibition of  bombing  &quot;oh the,territory and shipping of another sovereign State.&quot;   The two propositions are,&apos;-in fact, identical.       &apos;   &quot;:             H-     &apos;-&quot; it;.; ;:!n,;,;&apos;uf \JJ.MJ. p;;o:.  ji)     11.  It has, however, been said that the two proposals are not identical in sofar as the  position overseas is concerned.  It is  $iiggested1 thaV inclusion of thewords &quot;as between themselves&quot; in the Resolution, implies&apos;a1 Tight !to&apos;continuethe use of air bombardment for police purposes in overseas territories.   This maybe theoretically correct, but I have grave doubts as to  whether this contentioncan  be  maintained in  practice.   If the High Contracting Parties abandon onhumanitarian grounds, the  right to bomb  &quot;as between themselves,&quot; then it willbe, to say the least,  excessively  difficult  to  employ  air bombardment for themaintenance of security in overseas areas.  This  objection has been urged by theGovernment of India and the Air Ministry, and its truth is strikingly illustrated by recent events.  The  Government of India are faced with the prospect of serioustribal disturbances, but the mere  publication of  the terms of the Resolution infavour of prohibiting bombing has caused them to enquire whether air operationscould still be carried out although these had been strongly advocated by them afew weeks  previously in  CP. 126  (32),  (which I would urge  my  colleagues to re-read).     12.  If then the words &quot; as between themselves &quot; do not, in practice, providethe safeguard which they are intended  to provide, it is quite clear that recent events at Geneva have brought us within measurable distance  of acquiescing in aproposal for the abolition of air  bombing which is identical with the previousproposal, which was rejected, after exhaustive examination, on the very adequategrounds that it possessed considerable disadvantages  from the point of view ofImperial defence generally  and decisive  disadvantages from the point of view ofthe defence of this country.     13.  This is not all,  however.  I have constantly endeavoured to point outthat no policy which envisages a total prohibition of  air bombing can be in theinterests of this country.   The retention of bombing aircraft is as necessary forthe defence of this country as it is for the maintenance of security overseas.  TheAir Staff have never ceased to urge that the defence of  this country against air attack cannot be undertaken by &quot;fighters&quot;  and ground  defences alone.  Thishas  been the accepted policy of successive Governments  and accounts for theexisting composition  of  the  Home  Defence Force, which includes  a  largepercentage of &quot;bombers.&quot;     14.  In  so  far as the  position overseas  is concerned, nothing can obscurethe fact that prohibition of bombing will strike out of our hands a weapon whichhas  been proved to be economical,  effective and indispensable to our  defence.No other  country has made such extensive  use  of  air  power, and to no  other-country is  air power so essential.   The  manifold duties of the Royal Air Forceoverseas are  performed at a fraction of the  cost which  would be involved  if anattempt was made  to depute these duties to other services.     15.  Nor can it be said that the use of air power.by this country  has  been,in any  way,  inhumane.  On the contrary, there is  overwhelming evidence thatit has resulted in saving  countless lives, both British and native, which would otherwise have been sacrified in punitive expeditions and costly tribal wars.     16.  I must warn my colleagues that acquiescence in a policy of prohibitingair bombing  may  well have consequences  which will  prove  fatal to the safety of this country and the Empire as a whole     17.  I am  well aware that if we  assume that a pact for the prohibition ofair bombardment will be  faithfully and universally observed;: the. immunity ofthis country  to  air attack is,  in theory, secured, but I share the views of theCabinet Sub-Committee that there is no possible justification for  assuming thatit would be  observed.  I would remind my  colleagues that, in  the  course of&quot;conversations&quot; at Geneva, M. Paul-Boncour recently  advanced the view thatif a country resorted to war, in defiance of the Covenant and the, Kellogg Pact,then it  was difficult: to believe that it would observe a pact prohibiting it  from using coast  defence guns  for  other  purposes.   Precisely the  same  argumentapplies to the prohibition of the use of military  (or civil)&apos; aircraft for  bombing.
 The means to subject this country to air attack would still exist in the shape of civil  aircraft,  and military aircraft not technically designated as bombers but indistinguishable from them.  Nor have we  any means of knowing in advance what numbers of military aircraft will still remain after the so-called &quot;bombers &quot; have  been  eliminated.     18.  I have always urged that  prohibition of bombing will only provide an illusion of security, in so far as the civil population is concerned.  It  is certain to be disregarded in war,  and, when this occurs, no rules for the Conduct of air bombardment  will  exist  to  shield  the civil population from  the effects of indiscriminate and unrestrained bombing.     19.  It may be said that The Hague Rules  are only another form of paper pact.  There is,  however, an  essential difference  between  a pact to  restrict bombing to military objectives and  a pact to abolish it altogether.   The former is reasonable, and this affords strong grounds which experience  confirms for supposing  that it will be observed.  The latter has the effect of shielding purely military objectives from the consequences of military action; it  is, therefore, inherently  unreasonable, and there is every ground for supposing that it will not be observed.    20.  We have taken five months to arrive at a resolution  in favour of the prohibition of  bombing.  In achieving this, we  have jeopardised  the  safety of this country and of the Empire, and can obtain nothing in exchange except a sense of  security so essentially  illusory  that  its  real character must be  quickly recognised; a sense of security,  moreover, which  (if  the pact survives so long) is destined  to be  disastrously shattered in the event  of war.  We  have already caused serious uneasiness in the Royal Air Force which, if allowed to  continue, must inevitably impair the morale of the Service.    21.  It will, no  doubt, be said that we have gone so far along the dangerous path of prohibition that withdrawal  will not be easy, but fortunately  in  this matter we  do not stand alone.  There is no question of isolation, France, Japan and  the  Argentine  (who  needs aircraft for the protection of her  extensive coastline),  are definitely opposed to prohibition of bombing.  The French have only assented to  the Resolution with  the  greatest reluctance, and still hope to evade a total prohibition of air bombardment.  These countries will support us. We are told it is essential not to antagonise America;  but the United States Delegation, although themselves advocating prohibition of bombing, have stated that they are prepared to  accept any settlement, short of  this, which commends itself to Europe.  Germany and Russia have voted  against  the Resolution,  and many States have abstained from voting.  In short, the opportunity to reassertour original policy still exists.    22.  The Declaration  of  British Disarmament  Policy contains concrete proposals for air disarmament (see paragraph 5 of this paper).  I  am convinced that these proposals  are the most practicable of any that have yet been  advanced and offer the best means of protecting the civil  population, provided only that this latter end is secured by the laying down of adequate rules for the restriction of air bombardment, on the lines of those originally proposed at The Hague,  and that no attempt is made to achieve this object by the French system of  zones for air bombing a method which is, in  my view,  impracticable and ineffective.    23.  If we are driven, by the apparent political exigencies of  the situation,to accept prohibition of air bombardment, we  shall certainly find ourselves faced,in the future, with consequences which will be far more serious than the political difficulties  which we now seek to avoid.   I suggest that we need to resume thathonest realism which is Great Britain&apos;s traditional policy.    24.  I  would urge  my  colleagues,  therefore, to reaffirm  in  unmistakable. terms the  air disarmament policy which we have  already  proclaimed,  and to decide once and for all that there shall be no further trifling with these dangerous and illusory proposals for  the prohibition of air  bombardment, which guaranteeus no security and must endanger the very foundations of the Empire.  I submit that our  Delegation  should be  instructed  only to  implement  Dr.  Benes&apos;resolution  so far as is compatible with our previously declared policy.    .4?:?- Ministry, July 30, 1932.o
