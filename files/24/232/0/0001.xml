But concerned by the economic difficulties resulting  from  the present crisis,    And being desirous to make,  so far as  they  are  concerned,  the necessary  efforts  to  ensure  the confidence  which is indispensable to  the  development of normal  economic   and  financial  relations between  the  nations.    The undersigned, duly authorised to that effect by their respective Governments,                              -                   ,    Have agreed  as  follows :                            Declaration.   The Powers signatory of the present Agreement have assembled at Lausanne to deal with one of the problems resulting from the war, with the firm  intention of helping to create a  new order;  permitting  theestablishment and development of confidence between the nations in amutual spirit of reconciliation, collaboration and justice.   They do not claim that the task accomplished at Lausanne, whichwill completely put an end to Reparations, can alone assure that peacewhich all the nations desire.  But  they hope that an achievement.ofsuch significance  and so arduously attained  will  be  understood andappreciated by all the pacific  elements in Europe and  the world, aridthat it will be followed by fresh achievements.    . -   These further successes will be more readily won if the nations willrally to this new effort in the cause of real peace, which can only  be complete if  it is applied both in the economic and  in the  political  sphereand rejects  all possibility of resort to arms or to violence.   The signatory Powers will make  every effort to resolve the problems which exist at the present moment or may arise subsequently  in thespirit which-has inspired the present Agreement.(*) Cmd. 3484.

    RESOLUTION RELATING TO A WORLD ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL                          CONFERENCE.        &apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;  &apos;   The] Conference, apart, from the,questions already dealt with,; has-further undertaken to decide upon &apos;&apos; the measures necessary,to.solve:the other economic  and financial, difficulties  ,which;are responsible.for, and may prolong, the present world crisis.&apos;.&apos;.                  i   The main questions of this order which demand examination  areas follows :-   fa)  Financial Questions.                           A-         Monetary  and credit policy.         Exchange  difficulties.         The level of prices.         The movement of capital.   (b)  Economic Questions.         Improved  conditions of production and trade interchanges,                with particular attention  to              Tariff policy.             Prohibitions and restrictions of importation and exporta-                tion,  quotas  and other harriers to trade.             Producers&apos; agreements.                              1   The Conference emphasises in particular the necessity of restoringcurrencies to a  healthy  basis and  of  thereby  making it possible to abolish measures of exchange control and to remove transfer difficulties;further, the Conference is impressed with the vital need of facilitating the revival of international trade.   To  achieve  the above purposes    The Conference decides to  invite the League of Nations to convokeul a convenient date and at a place to be fixed (not necessarily Geneva)a Conference on Monetary and Economic Questions.   The Conference decides to entrust  the preliminary examination ofthese complex questions, which are closely interdependent, to an autho-ritative committee of experts.   The Conference  therefore  invites the  Governments of Germany,Belgium, France, the  United Kingdom,  Italy  and  Japan each toappoint as members of the Committee two experts, one qualified to dealwith economic  questions, the other  qualified  to  deal with  financial questions.  The Committee would divide itself into two sub-committeesaccording to the two branches  of the subject.  The two sub-committees would  naturally have discretion to meet  in  joint session whenevernecessary,  with the  object of  ensuring the necessary co-ordination intheir labours.    The Conference further resolves to.invite the Government of theUnited States of America to be represented on the committee on thesame basis as the Governments of the States mentioned above.
Lausanne, July 9, 1932.Wt.-:.5ooo 7/32 F.O.P. 7172 Gp. 340   Finally, the Conference invites-the Council of,the League of nations to nominate three persons-qualified-by their financial competence, andthree persons qualified by  their economic competence.    It would  bedesirable that these persons should be nationals of countries-other thanthose mentioned above.  They might seek assistance from the directors of the EconomicVand Financial Sections&apos; of -the  Secretariat of theLeague.  The Conference suni la rly  seeks the collaboration of the bank for  International;&apos;Settlements and decides to -invite  the latter  to nominate two persons to participate in the work: of the Sub-Committeeon Financial  Questions.
