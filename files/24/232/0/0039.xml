[S DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAITNIC 1AJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,,                        CABINET.                                            Copy ;&apos;fo,_7              FEES AND FREE PI ACES IN SEC OTIDARY SCHOOLS.      MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN      REGARD TO CP, 259(58),JB9(32.)               Some of my colleagues will remember that  I mentione     this matter on August 4th and that it was decided to discuss     it at a meeting of the full Cabinet xn the middle of     Septembero               As I explained to those of my colleagues who were     present on August 4th, my predecessor had carried these     proposals to an advanced stage.   He had consultations with     representatives of Local Authorities as to the manner in     which the change might &quot;be most easily effected, and in     consequence there is now general anticipation that early     action will be taken on these lines.   Although I think, for_reasons sbated in the draft circular, that the present system     of distributing free places is needlessly wasteful of public     funds, I might have hesitated to take the matter up, unless     it had seemed likely that all departments would continue to     be pressed  tc make all possible economies,   And if this is     so, by the  revision of our practice in regard to secondary     school fees money can be saved without inflicting damage on     our general edvicational system.    The anticipated saving by     introducing a &quot;means test&quot; into the award of free places is     an immediate  saving in 1933-34 of   50,000 to the Exchequer     and  50,000 to the Rates.    This saving will increase     during successive years until the  full saving of  200,000 to
                                                                *) 0 othe Exchequer and  200,000 to the Hates is realised in thefourth year.       It was suggested in the course of the cabinet discussion on August 4th that it might he better to defer thisquestion, until it could be seen whether any, and if so what,other Educational economies would be found necessary.   but even if it were possible and desirable to enforce new and substantial economies, in addition to those which are subjects of administrative regulation and which are already in train,this v/ould require legislation of a very contentious kind, whichmust certainly involve delay.   And my main reason for bringingthis forward without waiting to consider any recommendations with regard to education that may be made by the economyCommittee of the Local Authorities set up by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, is that any further delay would exclude any ofthe proposed saving from next year&apos;s Budget.   Before a schemeof this kind can be introduced it is necessary that regulations should be published for 40 days, during which period objectionscan be made, and it will be appreciated that Local Authoritiesare unlikely to formulate their schemes until they know in what form  the regulations will be finally approved,   Even if mycwlleagues approve these proposals now this stage cannot bereached before the end of October.   Time will then be requiredfor the 149 Authorities concerned to prepare their schemes andfor their consideration and approval by the Board.   Thisapproval must in any case be given by the 1st April, 1933, andin many cases will be required much earlier since many localAuthorities hold their Scholarship Examinations before Easterfor entry into the Secondary Schools in the following September(London has an examination in December).   It is obvious thatif a change of system is to be effective by April next itmust be announced before Authorities have committed themselves                           2 o
 for another year to  their  existing schemes.   The opening paragraphs of  the Circular have been redrafted with a view to explaining more shortly and  in simpler language the changes that are proposed.        When the matter v/as  discussed in Cabinet on August 4th, the Secretary  of State for Scotland pointed out that the position  in Scotland is radically different from that in England in that Education  Authorities are under a statutory obligation to  provide free secondary education to duly qualified pupils without regard to means, and legislation would be required  if the system were  to be brought into conformity with that now  proposed.   In the  absence of such legislation the amount of money available  for education grants in Scotland (owing to the basis of grant being calculated in relation to the grants for England and Wales) would be reduced by some ,527,000,while the Education Authorities would remain under their present obligation.        I recognise the difficulty in which for this reason Scotland  is placed by my proposal, but I would none the less suggest that if on general grounds my proposal deserves approval, it is unreasonable that the Exchequer should be deterred by the consequential ultimate loss to Scotland of  27,000 (out of a total amount of  6,500,000 available in the Education (Scotland)Fund for general aid grant) from the realisation of ananticipated saving on England and Wales of  200,000, to theExchequer and   200,000 to  the Rates,                                       I.                                     August 25th,  1952.
                  BOARD  OF  EDUCATION.                                              Circular No.                    SECONDARY SCHOOLS.     1.   Enclosed herewith are revised draft Regulations forSecondary Schools.   In revising the Regulations the board have felt hound to take account of two criticisms \vhich haverecently been made with increasing force, viz., that (a) Thesjrstem of admitting pupils free to secondary schools withoutany regard to the capacity of the parents to pay is needlesslywasteful to public funds, and runs counter to the principle,now generally accepted, that where educational awards are madeby public or quasi-public bodies the amount of any assistance given should vary according to the circumstances of thesuccessful candidates.   (b) The fees charged often bear but asmall proportion to the cost of the education provided, andare frequently not adequate having regard to what parentscan afford to pay.     2.   In formulating a scheme designed to meet thesecriticisms the Board have been principally concerned to maintainthe facilities which Local Education Authorities and  Governorsat present offer for poor parents to obtain for their children the benefits of secondary education, and have for this purposethought it necessary, as is now the case, to have regard to    -jvarying local conditions.     3.   At present a proportion, and sometimes the whole, ofthe places in a school are filled by competitive examination,the successful candidates at which are admitted free.   Underthe new Regulations fees will be charged in all schools and while places (in future to be called special places) willcontinue to be filled by open competition, the parents of pupils successful in the competition will be expected to pay                           1.
9 A &apos;Jthe  school fee, except where their circumstances justify itsremission either wholly or in part,   The provisions of thenew  Regulations contemplate that the number of specialplaces to be offered in any area will be similar to the numberof free places at present offered.     4,   The Board recognise that it would not be reasonable to expect that the conditions for the special remission of feesshould be uniform for the whole country.   They contemplatefor  complete exemption from fees an income limit of  3 to  4a week in the case of a family with one child, plus an addition     s ,d.of 10/-   for each additional child, or any alternative schemehaving equivalent effect.   In considering proposals put forward for  approval by Local Authorities and Governors, they will haveregard to the particular circumstances of the area in question and  the rate of fee to be charged.     5,   Again, sis regards increases in existing fees, theBoard do not desire to lay down any uniform standard, but theyconsider that it would be not unreasonable to look for some increase where the fee is at present below 15 guineas a year;and while regard must necessarily be had to the fees at presentcharged, they will ordinarily hesitate in future to approvea fee of less than 9 guineas,          Where so desired arrangements may properly include provision for some reduction of fees for pupils over 16 whohave passed an approved First Examination.          Yvhere a school contains a preparatory department      tthe Board consider that the fee charged to pupils in that department should be either the school fee or 15 guineas,whichever is the higher.     6.   The Board are aware of the problems presented by anyproposal for obtaining increased fee income from existing pupilsparticularly in the absence of a solution of any legal     .      :                 2,                                  -
2i2clifficulties which may be involved, but in view of the financialexigencies of the time they think that authorities may reasonably consider the propriety of asking parents of pupilsalready in the schools on 1st April 1933, to pay the increasedfees, where they can afford to do so.   In the case of pupilsadmitted after 1st April 1933, authorities and Governors will wish to consider how  far provision should be made for the review of initial awards where there is a change in the parents&apos;circumstances.     70   It is not proposed that the arrangements referred toabove should normally apply to schools in receipt of directgrant, since the fees in such schools are in general relatively high, and variations of fee  or of the proportion of free and fee-paying pupils do not affect the grant payable bythe Board to such schoi-ls.   Provision will accordingly bemade in the Regulations for a continuance of the existing provisions relating to fees and free places in the case of schools in receipt of direct grant, subject to a proviso thatthe admission of a qualified candidate shall be treated asthe award of a free place if he holds a scholarship awarded byan authority which covers such part of the tuition fee andof any entrance fee as is determined under approved arrangements to be appropriate to his financial circumstances.     8.   If the new arrangements are to be brought intooperation on the 1st April 1935, it is important that theproposals of authorities, and of Governors of schools notin receipt of direct grant, should be submitted for the examination and approval of the Board not later than the1st January 1933.   The Board accordingly hope that authoritiesand Governors will give the matter their early considerationboth individually and, where necessary, in consultation.
