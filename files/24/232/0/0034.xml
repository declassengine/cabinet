REPORT.                      I. INTRODUCTORY.   IN  accordance  with  our  instructions  we  have  examined  therecommendations contained in the Report of the Committee on  the fishing  Industry of the  Economic  Advisory Council and submitherewith, for the consideration of the Cabinet, the following statementof our conclusions.   2.  Our report  represents the  views of the various departments on the matters  discussed.   It should not,  however,  be taken ascommitting the  Ministers concerned  to  the conclusions  expressedtherein.   3.  For convenience of  reference  we refer  throughout to  theCommittee  of  the  Economic  Advisory  Council  on  the  fishing industry, of which  Professor Scott was Chairman at the time of  the signature of their Report, as the Scott Committee.            II. WHITE  FISH  AND  TRAWLING.(a)  Conditions  of  employment and  remuneration in  the  trawling                            industry.   4.  The Scott Committee examined the question of the conditionsof employment and remuneration  in the trawling industry generally in paragraphs 44-67 of their report.   In the section beginning at paragraph 59 they considered in detail the complaints put before themby organisations  claiming to represent the fishermen  at some of  thelarger trawling ports.  These complaints related to four main subjects :(i) Signing on and off of  the crews, (ii) conditions of safety at sea,(iii) settling sheets, and (iv) sale of fish at the ports.   5.  The Scott Committee began by  observing that the trade unionwitnesses who appeared before them  had readily admitted  that  thetask of organising the deck staff in steam trawlers (as distinct fromthe engineers) had proved slow and difficult.  This is a point of 6omeimportance  in discussing the alleged abuses in the  labour conditionsof the industry, upon which it has a double bearing.  On the one hand,the fact that the  trade  union membership covers only  a  small proportion of the whole of the men employed in the industry naturallyraises doubts as to  the extent to which the views of the trade unionwitnesses were representative.  Where membership of the union is  theexception rather than the rule, there must naturally be some tendency for it to attract  into its ranks  those elements in the  industry whichfeel discontented and aggrieved.  It may  well be, therefore, that  theabuses complained of are not^ in fact, as prevalent as was suggested.There is  no inherent obstacle in the way of organising these men, andthe absence of organisation may in itself be taken as an indication that, as a body, they have no strong sense of grievance.   6.  At  the  same  time  the fact that  the men  employed in  thetrawling  industry cannot  rely for protection upon a  strong labourorganisation renders it all the more necessary for the  State to securethat the men  are  fairly  treated.   The  Scott  Committee  were undoubtedly of the  opinion that abuses were  current in such matters as the engagement of men, the form  in which settling  sheets  are presented and the  sale of  fish at  the  ports,  and they suggested an alteration of the existing  law on each of these points.   7.  While we do not  wish to question the conclusions reached by the Committee  as to  the facts of the situation,  we  think thatthe amendments which  they  proposed in  the Merchant ShippingAct, 1894,  will  be found  on examination  to  be open  to certain important  objections.   Taking the suggested amendments in  theorder  in which  they appear in the  summary  of  recommendations(paragraph  884  of  the Report), we find  that in the first place  theCommittee recommended  (recommendation 1  (a) (i)) that it shouldbe made  compulsory for  the  signing on and off  of the crews of
fishing vessels to take place at the Board  of Trade offices in thepresence of a  Superintendent of  a Mercantile Marine office or his deputy.   The  effect  of such  an  amendment  would be  to renderobligatory a practice  which though once fairly common has  recentlybecome more  and more infrequent.  To some  extent this has  been due to the increase in  the charges made by the Board of Trade forthe  witnessing of engagement and discharge.   The fact that beforethe  fee was raised from 6d. to Is. many owners  availed themselves of the services of the Superintendent for the  attestation of  men onengagement or discharge, suggests that from the owners&apos;  point ofview such a practice has  its advantages in the promotion  of  gooddiscipline.   The  trade  union witnesses  for their  part urged that ifthis practice were made compulsory,  it would do much to checkirregularities in connection with the engagement  of  men on fishing vessels.  In particular,  it would be more difficult for agents employedby  the companies in  recruiting crews to obtain sums from men as atacit condition  of engaging them,  as appears at present to  take place from time to time in  spite of the penalties prescribed by section 112of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.    8.   The adoption,  therefore,  of  the proposal to make  signingon  and off at the Board of  Trade offices  compulsory,  would, webelieve, secure  certain advantages.  Nevertheless it is impossible,particularly in  the present circumstances, to  ignore the cost  involvedin carrying it into effect.  At some ports it would be necessary forthe Board of Trade to build a special office;  at others existing officeswould have to be enlarged.   In most  cases  such  an extension ofthe  existing functions  of  Superintendents of Mercantile  Marineoffices  (including Customs officers acting as  such  at ports where no  Board of Trade officer  acts as Superintendent) would necessitateadditions to the staff  at present employed.    9.   The increase in  expenditure  required in respect  both  of accommodation and  salaries  might thus be considerable.  No doubtit would be at least partially covered by the  sums obtained from the fees charged to the industry, and would not, therefore, fall  entirelyupon public funds.  Nevertheless, there are obviously  the strongestobjections to the placing in this way of a considerable burden uponthe  trawling industry,  unless it  can be  regarded as certain  that substantial benefits would result.  With the existing scale of  charges,we   estimate the  cost  to  the  industry  at  something  approaching 20,000 annually.  Even if  the expectations of the Scott Committeewere realised,  and as  a result of the  increase  in  the number  ofcrews  signing on at  the Board of Trade offices the scale of charges were reduced, it  is evident that the cost to  the industry would stillbe by no means negligible.   It is, moreover, particularly undesirable that  the  trawling industry  should be  called  upon  to meet  theseexpenses  at  the  present  moment.   Although  until  recently itsprosperity was  increasing steadily, there has latterly been a markedbreak  in this development, and at the present time  the industry isfeeling the effects of the depression to  a considerable degree.  TheScott  Committee  referred  (in  paragraph  66)  to  the  additional expenditure by the  Board of Trade  which would be  necessitated by the changes they proposed,  and agreed that &quot; no new expenditureof this kind would be justified unless it could  be  shown that it was really required for  the proper  conduct of an essential service.&quot;Judged by this test  we cannot  agree  that  the advantages of thisproposal are sufficient  to  warrant the  expenditure which it would entail, and we  therefore recommend that this  suggestion should notbe adopted.    10.  The Scott Committee further recommended  (recommenda-tion 1 (a) (ii))  that it should be made compulsory for owners to give to each member  of the crew of a  fishing vessel who is paid partly by a share in the profits, a  detailed settling sheet in the  form nowfurnished to skippers  and mates.  Under the existing law, the owner of every fishing boat  is bound to  give to every member of the  crewan  account  of  wages or  share, as the  case may be,  in the formapproved by the Board  of Trade.  In the case of skippers and matesthe settling accounts must also show in detail the amounts for whichthe fish&quot; has been sold and all deductions from those amounts charge-able either in respect of stores or of provisions or otherwise.   Tho
Committee felt that it would be of advantage  for every member ofthe crew to have access to the fullest possible information regardingthe basis on which  an important part of their earnings is calculated,with a view to maintaining and  increasing the confidence which  themen feel  in the  fairness of those calculations.   11.  With this  view we fully agree, but we consider  that  therecommendation  of the  Committee  goes  further  than  is  eithernecessary or desirable in requiring that  a copy of the settling sheetshould be issued to  each  man.   Both  trouble and  expense wouldbe saved, while at  the same time all reasonable  desire for informa-tion would  be satisfied, if the  owners  were required  to exhibit  a detailed settling sheet for  the information  of the crew  at  the timeand place at which  settlements are made.   12.  The  Scott  Committee were, in addition,  anxious to meetfurther criticisms made  in the  course of evidence  before them, whichconcerned the accuracy as well  as  the accessibility of  information regarding the basis of settlement.  Witnesses  alleged not only thatfraudulent entries were sometimes made in settling sheets, but alsothat where this occurred it  was extremely difficult for the men to finda remedy.  It was  true  that they had the  right to appeal in easesof dispute to the Superintendent of the Mercantile Marine office.but  the   witnesses   maintained  that  at certain ports  men were reluctant  to lay  complaints before the  Superintendent, or even toask the owners for  an explanation of a  doubtful point in the settlingsheet,  for fear of victimisation.   It was asserted that in more thanone case  men who had done so had found themselves without employ-ment for  a considerable time  afterwards.   The Committee proposedto meet this situation in two  ways.   In the first place  they  recom-mended   (recommendation 1  (a) (iii))  that  it should  be  madecompulsory for the  owner of a  fishing vessel  to furnish  to  theSuperintendent  a certified true  copy  of the  settling  sheet issued to  the  skipper, mate,  and  crew,   and  that  failure  to  do  soshould be made  an offence subject  to a substantial fine.  By  thismeans they hoped  to create amongst the owners a  greater sense ofresponsibility  with regard to settling sheets, and  a feeling that their actions in  these matters  were  the  subject of  official  supervision.Further,  in  order  that  the   Superintendent  might  be  enabled to investigate  suspected cases of fraud, without  attaching  to  themembers  of the  crew the suspicion  of having lodged  a complaint,they recommended (recommendation 1 (a)  (iv)) that the  Board ofTrade  should be  given  such  powers  as   might  be necessary toenable Superintendents to satisfy themselves  that settling sheetssubmitted to  them represented a true  statement  of  the cost  of avoyage and of  the proceeds  therefrom.   Superintendents  were tobe  empowered to make such inquiries from  time to time  and totake any necessary action against the owners  without waiting  forcomplaints  to be received.    18.   Although we recognise  the desirability of the objects whichthe Committee had  in view in making this latter recommendation, webelieve that they will,  in practice,  be adequately secured  by theadoption of the first of the Committee&apos;s proposals.   We  concur withtheir recommendation 1 (a) (iii) that it should be made compulsory foran owner of  a  fishing vessel  to furnish  to  the  Superintendent,.as soon as possible  after each  settlement, a certified true copy of thesettling sheet issued.    14.   If this were done it would, we think, be unnecessary to extendfurther  the  powers and  duties of   the  Superintendents  in  theway suggested by the Scott Committee. The owners of fishing vessels,.knowing that a copy of the settling sheet was to  be forwarded to the mercantile  Marine  offices, would hesitate to put forward statements of a fraudulent nature.   At the same  time the men would tend to feelgreater confidence  in a statement which was in this way, to someextent, at least, subject to official supervision.  We  contemplate  thatthe  statement should be available for inspection at the MercantileMarine  office,  and  its  ready  availability  for  the   use  of   theSuperintendent,  in the event of a man desiring to make a  complaintunder Section 887  of the  Merchant  Shipping Act,  1894,  would, we think, undoubtedly be regarded by the men as a fresh safegard of
their interests.   On the other hand, the examination and verificationof a large number of settling sheets in the manner suggested by theScott  Committee would require  a considerable amount of work of a kind calling  for  some knowledge of accountancy.   It could not becarried  out by  the Superintendents without appreciable  increases in  the   staff  employed  and  extension  of  office  accommodation.In  these circumstances we  consider that  recommendation 1 (a) (iv,should not be adopted.    15.   The amendments  to the  Merchant  Shipping  Act,  1894,which   we  suggest,  would in  the ordinary course  apply  onlyto  men  employed  on  steam  trawlers  of  25  tons  gross   and upwards.  If,   however,  the  point  were  raised  in  Parliament,there   appears   to   be  no   serious  objection   to  their  beingextended so as to  include  men  employed  on  such  liners  anddrifters  as are at present required by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,to  comply with  certain requirements applicable to steam  trawlers,i.e., the requirements as to a certificated skipper and a certificatedsecond-hand which are applicable to liners and drifters of 50 tons  grossand upwards propelled by steam and other mechanical power.    16.   In reviewing the conditions of employment in the  trawlingindustry, the Scott Committee also considered the provisions of theMerchant Shipping Act, 1894, in respect  of  life-saving appliances tobe  carried on board fishing  vessels.  The Rules laid down in the act of  1894 in regard  to  these matters were originally  enacted in theMerchant Shipping  Act,  1854.   The Committee  observed that theappliances carried on fishing vessels were not, in fact,  limited to  thoseprescribed  in 1854, but that it  was nevertheless very desirable  thatfishing  vessels should be  governed by up-to-date regulations.   they therefore recommended (recommendation 1 (a) (v)) that the require-ments of the Act should be revised so as to  be applicable to modern conditions, and  that power  should be given to the Board  of Trade to vary them from time to time as circumstances required.  We agreethat it is desirable that these matters should be governed by up-to-date.regulations.    17.   We recommend that Parliament should be invited, at the firstconvenient  opportunity,  to  approve legislation  dealing  with thepoints  discussed  in paragraphs  11,  18,  and  16,  above.   this legislation will involve no new charge on public funds.    18.   Discontent was also expressed in the evidence laid before theScott Committee with the method by which  fish is sold at the ports.Under the present system these sales are conducted by an auctioneer&quot;who is  usually either the owner or the servant of the owners of the fishing  vessels.   It was suggested to the Scott&apos; Committee that, as aresult, it sometimes happened that the correct amounts fetched by thefish were not set out in the sales notes used to support the settling-sheets.   Thus,  it was alleged that sometimes the rate on such salessheets was less than the rate at which the fish  was actually sold, or thatthe salesmen permitted the  purchaser to appropriate a larger numberof boxes than had, in fact, been knocked down to him, with the resultthat the full number of boxes sold was not credited in the settling-sheets.   Again,  it was maintained that in one port the prices obtained for boxes  sent  off by  an  early train  before  the  beginning of theauction  were  not   always  included in  the  settling-sheets.    the witnesses who  made  these allegations did  not suggest that  theseirregularities were either wide-spread or of common occurrence.   Theyclaimed, however, that the  fact that such irregularities could and didtake place from time to time tended to undermine the confidence ofships&apos; crews in  the  accuracy  of  the settling-sheets to an extent outof all proportion to the frequency of their occurrence.    19.   To meet this complaint the Scott Committee  recommendedthat Parliament  should be asked to confer upon the Board of Tradepower,  after inquiry, to prescribe  by order, in cases of ports  wherethey considered such a course desirable,  that the sale by auction oftrawled  fish  which  affected the   settling-sheets  between  owners,skippers and crews should only be conducted by salesmen independent of the owners of the fishing vessels.  In such cases they suggested thatthe servants of railway companies, dock companies or local authorities might be appointed salesmen.
   20.  As regards this recommendation there is, in the first place,considerable objection to the proposal that the Board of Trade shouldbe empowered to deal with this matter by orders affecting individualports.  We do not feel that the task of adjudicating upon the standards of honesty prevailing at the various fishing ports is one which  can reasonably be laid upon the Department.   If legislative powers areto be taken to deal with this matter it is preferable that these shouldbe conferred  upon  the Department  by Parliament  in  a  generalenactment applicable to all fishing ports.  In the second place account must be taken of the cost to the trawling industry of the introductionof any system such as the Scott Committee recommended.  We are notin a position  to  measure in precise terms  the  burden  which would thereby be imposed  upon the industry.  There can be little doubt,however, that it would be by no means inconsiderable.   21.  Moreover, in the course of our consideration of this subjectwe have felt inclined to doubt whether the evidence for the existenceof the  abuses  which  it is proposed  to  remedy in this  manner  is sufficiently definite  to justify  interference  by the  State with thefreedom of individuals  to conduct  their own business.  In  order  toassist ourselves in reaching a definite conclusion on this subject, wecommunicated  with  the Railway Clearing House and requested  thatwe might have the  benefit in this matter  of  the  experience of therailway companies, who, as owners of the  majority of  the principalfish  docks, are well  qualified to form an opinion.  In reply,  we were informed that the general managers of the railway companies, thoughperiodical rumours of dissatisfaction with the method of sale of fishat the  ports had reached them,  had no definite knowledge of anygeneral abuse in this connection.  They  were unable to suggest any means by which the alleged irregularities, if they did,  in fact, occur,might be prevented.  On the whole, we have come  to  the conclusionthat the evidence in regard  to the prevalence of dishonest practices inthe  sale of fish at the ports cannot be considered sufficient to justifyintervention  of the kind proposed by the Scott Committee.  We con-sider, however, that the fisheries departments should bear in mind thepossibility that suspicions of this kind may prove in the future a source of discontent amongst the men employed in the  industry.    22.  Finally we have to refer to the suggestion put  forward  bythe  Committee  in paragraph 67 of their Report, that it is  desirablethat in the fishing industry &apos;&apos; arrangements should be  made for the setting up, as has  been done  in other industries,  of some form of machinery for collective discussion between the owners on the onehand, and the men on the other.&quot;  The Committee recognised that owing to the peculiarities  of the fishing industry  and the  diversity of conditions  under  which fishing is conducted,  such  machinery would not be easily established.  They recommended, however, that this question should be further explored  by the Fisheries Dcpart- ment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and by the Fishery Board  for Scotland  in consultation with the parties concerned.     28.  The Committee stated that in many cases excellent and long- standing relations exist between owners and  men.  We agree with them that anything which could be done which would  help to  main- tain and develop such  relations would be  of the greatest advantage to the industry.  At  the  same time we  consider that the method which  they  propose takes no  account of one serious difficulty.  The Committee themselves remarked  in paragraph 59 of their Report that such organisation of labour  as  exists  amongst  the deck staff in the trawling industry, is  largely in the making,  and they  added this was hardly to be wondered at  in view of the strong individualistic tendencies of the  fisherman  which  the independent  nature of  his work intensified.  Nevertheless, if such is the position, there  would clearly  be  the greatest difficulty  in arranging for  joint  conferences between representatives of the owners  and of the men.   Until  the men  are sufficiently united  to appoint  representatives to  speak  for them, there can be no method open  to the fisheries  departments of bringing their representatives into contact with the  representatives of the owners.   If at any time in  the future a strong and represenhi-  tive labour organisation were to  grow up  in  the  trawling  industry,  we should agree that joint discussion with the owners on matters  of  common  interest  might well prove  extremely  valuable.  In  the  meantime,  we  see no way in which the suggestion of  the  Scott  Committee  could be carried into  effect.
                                t)                      (b)  Billingsgate market.                     (i) Sales on commission.   24.   In paragraphs 81-96  the  Scott  Committee investigatedvarious complaints which  had  been  made to them with regard  tothe conditions at Billingsgate market.  In particular there were twosuch  complaints which  the  Committee  regarded as of importance,and which they made the  subject of  recommendations.  The first  ofthese referred  to the system  by which  fish is  sold in  the marketby salesmen acting both  as merchants buying  and selling fish ontheir  own  account,  and as  commission agents  acting on behalf  offishermen  and port wholesale merchants.  It was  alleged  that thecommission salesmen  frequently failed to return to the  sender theactual price at which  the  fish had been  sold.   In  the second place the complaint was made that the list of &quot;daily  prices&quot;  at  Billings-gate purporting  to give representative prices obtained for  differentclasses of fish in the market was based on inadequate data and didnot, in fact, represent the  prices actually obtained.  It was suggestedthat  the published prices  were inflated both  in  order  to  enable theretailer to justify his prices to the  consumer  and also  to preventthe retailer from feeling that  he himself had paid an unduly high price.   25.   It is evident that there is a close connection between thesetwo complaints.   If  the &quot;daily  prices&quot; published at Billingsgateare found by port merchants and fishermen to be higher  than thosewhich they have themselves received, it is natural  that they  shouldsuspect their commission  agents of unfair dealing.   26.   In order to deal with the  first of these complaints, theScott Committee recommended  that legislation should  be  introducedproviding  restrictions  of  a,  kind similar  to  those  in force  in thecentral  food markets of Paris,  where salesmen  are required  to actas commission  agents  only and are prohibited from  engaging  inselling  on their own  account  either in  the market or  elsewhere.They also quoted  (paragraph  90) the  precedent  wThich exists forsuch legislation in  the Horticultural  Produce (Sales on Commission)Act, 1926.  The  Act makes it obligatory upon the salesman to advise the sender of  the  actual  price  paid or  agreed  to  be paid  for the produce.   It also enables  the  consignor to require  the salesman  toproduce  any records,  books  or documents in his possession,  so faras they  relate to the  sale  of  such  produce, for inspection  by  anaccountant  nominated  by  the  consignor,  being  an   accountantpossessing such qualifications as may be prescribed by the  Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, or, in Scotland, by the Department  ofAgriculture for Scotland.  We  understand that the  experience of theMinistry of Agriculture  and Fisheries points to the conclusion thatthe Act is  a valuable weapon in the  hands of growers  when sendingconsignments to fresh markets or  unknown salesmen.   Since theAct was passed, there have been a number of cases instituted byaggrieved growers in which convictions have been secured for  failure to render detailed accounts.  It seems clear that  it has  been effective in checking the irregularities against which it was directed.   27.   There appears to be a close similarity between the conditions prevailing in the marketing of fish and the marketing of horticulturalproduce.   In both  cases  it  is  desirable that  the  small  producershould  have  some  protection  against   dishonesty  on   the partof the salesman who disposes  of  his product.   We  concur  in therecommendation  of  the  Scott  Committee  that legislation should beintroduced to deal  with  these  matters.  We  think  that it would be suffiently wide  in scope  if  it were framed  on the lines  of the Actto which we have referred above, which  has been  found to providea satisfactory remedy for a similar situation.  If such  legislation were  enacted we consider that it would be unnecessary  to take further action on the  subject of &quot;daily prices,&quot; unless  it appeared that  the publication of this list in its present form  tended to  inflateretail prices.  The list would no longer be used by port  merchants and fishermen as a  means of checking the prices received by them,since  they  would be in possession of other and more  effective methodsof control.

                  (ii) The extension of the market.     28.   At this point it is convenient to  refer to the discussion in paragraphs 97-108  of  the  Scott Committee&apos;s  Report regarding  the need  for  some  extension  and improvement  of  the  market  at Billingsgate in view of the congestion and delay at present experienced there.  Broadly, we are in agreement with the general course of the argument.  There  is,  however, one addition which we wish to make to the list of factors enumerated in paragraph 107 as likely to diminish in  the future  the  importance of the market  in  the system of  fish distribution in this country.    29.  The Scott Committee pointed out that  to a growing extent it is becoming customary for retail merchants to obtain part of their supplies direct from the merchants at the ports, and that in this  and other ways it  is probable that the relative importance of Billingsgate in the general system of distribution will be smaller in the future than it has been in  the past.  They added that the effect of such changes on the market must be a matter for serious consideration.    30.   In attempting to estimate the future share of Billingsgate in the total fish trade of the country, account must now be taken of a new and important factor represented by the adoption last March of a policyof restricting imports of fish through tariff duties.   The existing dutyof 10 per cent, has  so far had little effect in diminishing the volumeof imports.  Should, however, the duty be increased in the future toa level at which its effect  upon imports was  prohibitive, the change in the position of Billingsgate might well be considerable.  At the present time about a quarter of the fish sold in the market comes from foreignsources.   There is  every possibility that if these supplies were  cut off,  their  place would be  taken by fish passing  through  different&apos;-channels of distribution.   The retailer  who found  that he could  no longer obtain Danish plaice from Billingsgate might turn to the port merchants for  an alternative supply, and obtain British fish throughihe system of direct distribution which the Scott Committee described.How far this  tendency  would be carried  it  is  impossible to  say. Foreign fish, however, represents so important a part of the businessof Billingsgate that its disappearance would necessarily result for a time, at any rate, in a serious disturbance of the trade of the market. For this reason we think that no useful conclusion can be reached with regard to the  degree of  congestion likely to  be experienced at Billingsgate in the  future,  until sufficient time has elapsed to  make clear the effect on the market of any reduction in imports which may take place.  In any case, the  suggestion put  forward by the  Scott Committee that assistance  should  be given  to  the  Billingsgate extension by the Government on the same lines as to other public utility schemes is not now practicable,  owing to the  decision of  His Majesty&apos;s Government  not  to  ask Parliament to renew the Develop-ment (Loan Guarantees  and Grants) Act,  1929, which expires this month.                     (c)  Imports of white fish.   31.   The  recommendation  of the  Scott   Committee  that  the question of imposing restrictions on the imports of  white fish, which amount to the  substantial figure of , 8,000,000, should be considered by  His Majestj&apos;&apos;s  Government in connection with any steps which might be  taken with  a view to improving  the  balance of  trade ^paragraphs 121-124), has been met by the decision  of the Govern- ment to impose a tariff on the importation of  white fish.                     (d)  Exports of  dried fish.   32.   The Scott Committee recorded their opinion in paragraph  127 of their  Report that large potential markets for dried fish and fish- meal for human consumption existed  in Africa and the  East, and that the possibility of developing these markets  should  be considered.They suggested that the Fisheries Departments should confer with the  Department of  Overseas  Trade on  the  question  of undertakingspecial inquiries with this end in view.  We were informed by  the Department  of Overseas  Trade  that,  in  consultation  with  firms interested in  trade with Africa and the East, they had both recently,and  on previous occasions,  devoted some attention to the possibility
of developing the markets referred to.  These inquiries had shown fhatthe fish consumed in Africa and the East is obtained for the most part from  local fishing grounds  or from sources of  supply (such as  theCanary Islands) less distant than the United Kingdom.   There appears,in fact, to be little  prospect that the  British producer could  competesuccessfully in these markets.   In these circumstances  we  considerthat no useful purpose would be served by a further inquiry such as was suggested by the Scott Committee.(e) Need for further information on the marketing  of  white fish.   83.   In describing the  working of the system  by which whitefish is marketed and distributed in this country, the  Scott committee referred  (paragraphs 130-184) to  a  proposal  which  had been  put before them by the English and Scottish Fisheries Departments inwhich it  was suggested that  a comprehensive survey should be under-taken, to be  conducted  by specially appointed  investigators  underthe auspices of both Departments, into the marketing of fish  and  fishproducts in  Great  Britain.   It  was  represented that  neither  theEnglish nor the Scottish Departments had extended its sphere so asto cover  the marketing of fish for home consumption in the way thatthe marketing of  agricultural  produce had  been  covered  by  the markets  division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.  TheScott  Committee  observed that  their own experience in the courseof their  inquiry had confirmed the need  for the proposed investiga-tion,  since they had found  it difficult to obtain  an  accurate  picture of the fish marketing structure as a whole.  They added that it  wasthe view of the Departments that in  existing financial circumstances it would  not be possible to proceed with such an inquiry immediately.They  recommended, however, that as soon as  financial  conditionspermitted a systematic marketing inquiry should be  undertaken  onthe lines suggested.   84.   The proposal, as it was originally conceived, required  theappointment of special investigators, and the Departments recognisedthat the necessary expenditure  could  not be incurred  in  existing financial  conditions.   When,  however,  we  came  to discuss thisrecommendation we were informed that,  after  further consideration,the Fisheries  Department   of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  andFisheries had reached the conclusion that substantially similar and,in some  respects,  better results  might be obtained by  placing thisinvestigation in the hands  of their  own District  Fishery  Officers.Their experience of the  industry would be of  considerable value inenabling them to elicit the facts of the marketing system.   Moreover,if this course were adopted,  no addition to  the existing staff  and resources of the Department  would be required for the  purpose ofthis  inquiry.   The  investigations  of the District  Fishery  Officersmight be directed  both to the methods by which fish is  sold at  the ports  and  the system  by  which it is distributed through inlandmarkets.  The latter subject especially was one  on  which the ScottCommittee declared themselves  unable to obtain much information.   85.   We  are informed by the Fishery  Board for Scotland thatas regards  Scotland also  this  investigation could  be undertaken without addition to the  existing staff and resources of  the  Depart-ment.   We therefore recommend that  the two Departments should carry  out such an  inquiry  as soon as possible.  We consider thatthe scope of the investigation which, as originally proposed, was tobe  confined  to the marketing of  white fish,  might  usefully  beextended so as to include  the methods by which herrings are marketedboth in  England and in  Scotland.               (f)  Surveying of new  fishing grounds.   86.   At the conclusion of the section of their  Beport dealing withwhite fish and the  trawling industry, the Scott  Committee  referredto the steps taken in connection  with the survey of  new  fishinggrounds  as  a result of their interim Report.   In  this Report  theCommittee had given support to the claim put forward  by the British trawlers&apos;.Federation that further surveys were required with a viewto diminishing the  expenditure  in  time  and  money incurred   bytrawlers  in fishing the more distant  waters, and  that  in view of  the    [7839]                                              c 2
fact  that the  results of these  surveys would be  made  available bypublication to the whole world,  it was reasonable  that  the  cost of conducting them should be borne out of public rather  than  privatefunds.  The  Committee stated that the recommendations containedin their interim Report had been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.   A  new  surveying vessel,  H.M.S.  Challenger,  had  beencompleted  in  the  summer of 1981, and would have  been ready to start  the work for which she was designed  in the autumn.   As aresult, however, of the financial crisis His Majesty&apos;s  Governmenthad  felt  themselves unable at  the moment to incur the expenditurethat  would be  necessary to  carry  out  the  survey,  though theyinformed the  British Trawlers&apos; Federation that the survey would be proceeded with if  the Federation could provide the necessary funds.The Federation were unable to do this, and for the present, therefore,no fishery surveys would be carried out by  the Challenger.   87.   The  Committee pointed out that this  was less unfortunatethan  might appear at first sight since the progress  of the depressionhad  served to diminish considerably the consumption of white fish.For  the  time being, therefore,  the existing  fishing grounds were adequate to the needs  of  the  trade.   This, however, was likely to prove a  very transient state of things in view of the  long periodtendency  for the  consumption  of  white  fish to  increase.   they recommended accordingly that the work of the  survey should be putin hand as soon as financial conditions became somewhat easier andwithout waiting until there was an actual shortage of white  fish.   38.   We   agree  with  the  Scott  Committee  that  it is  highly desirable that this work should be  put in hand as soon as  cireum-stances permit,  particularly in view of the fact  that the  survey isone requiring a long period of years for its completion.  We there-fore concur in the Committee&apos;s recommendation.              III.-HERRINGS  AND  DRIFTING.              (a) The  regulation of the export trade.   89.   The Scott Committee discussed the subject of the regulationof the export trade in pickled herrings in paragraphs 214-220 of theirReport.  They observed that the essential  feature of the  situation wasthe  disproportion which existed  between the markets at  present available and the catching power of  the  fleet, which had generallyresulted  in recent years in the  curing of some  100,000 barrels  ofherrings in excess  of  the quantity which could be  marketed at aremunerative  price.  The difficulties thus  created  were not, however,those of over-production pure and simple,  but were aggravated by&apos;thocuring of immature herrings caught in the earliest days of the season,which did not keep for more than a limited  time, any surplus of which,therefore,  exercised a particularly adverse effect upon the market forherrings later in the year.   Similarly,  if curing  was unduly prolongedat the end of the season the surplus so created had to be carried overinto the following year and exercised  a depressing influence on thopi-ice at which newly-bought herrings could be marketed.   40.   The  Committee pointed out that  for various  reasons  Britishexporters held  a  predominant position  in the market for pickledherrings, foreign competition being of comparatively small importance.On this score, therefore, there could be no obstacle  to the exercise ofa controlling  influence  over production by British  producers.  such control,  moreover,  was in many directions highly desirable.  TheCommittee recommended,  therefore, that Parliament should be askedto provide for the establishment of a board representing  registered producers, i.e., curersand exporters, empowered, inter alia, to regulate the periods during which herrings should be pickled in Great  Britain,and to prohibit the export of British herrings pickled outside the periodprescribed  by the board.  The board should also  be  given  power toundertake  other functions, such  as  the promotion of  research and provision for the advertisement  of pickled herrings abroad.   It wassuggested  that  at a later stage it might be possible to  extend  thefunctions of the board  so  as to cover the operations of the catchingside  of  the  industry  and  provide some  form   of  machinery forco-ordinating the number of drifters fishing at any particular port with
the probable demand for herrings at that port.  The Committee added,however, that it was doubtful whether opinion in the catching sectionof the industry was prepared at the present time to accept any suchmeasure of regulation.    41.  We agree with the Scott Committee that the proper regulationof the export trade is a  matter of  great  importance to  the herringindustry.  We are, however, doubtful  whether it would be possible togive  effect  to their recommendation  on this subject at  the presentmoment.  Considerable changes have  taken place in the  situation inthe herring industry since the time when it received the considerationof the Committee.  Owing to the financial  and  economic conditions inthe countries which form the chief markets  for pickled herrings,  thedemand has been  still further  restricted, and,  in  consequence,  thecurers were  forced to restrict their operations during the fishing at east anglia in the autumn of 1981 and to  limit the cure to a quantitysubstantially less than in  previous years.  No corresponding reductionin the number of fishing  vessels at  work had, however, taken place,and, as a  result,  the season was an  unprofitable  one for the majorityof the fishermen  engaged,  and the losses sustained gave rise to a feeling of  resentment on the part of  the  fishermen against the curers.Relations  between them  have  improved  recently,  and  they  have -operated  in the  arrangements for a sale of pickled herrings to  theSoviet, but it appears clear that any proposal to place statutory powers,of the kind contemplated in the recommendation,  in the hands ofcurers and  exporters  would  meet with  serious  opposition from  thefishermen.    42.  As a direct consequence  of the conditions  during  the EastAnglian fishing there has  recently been formed an organisation knownas the Scottish Herring Producers&apos;  Association, comprising Scottishherring fishermen and fish-salesmen, but  a  certain interval  must elapse before this body is  firmly established and is able to acquire  theexperience necessary to exert an effective  and beneficial influence inthe regulation of the  industry or to  assist  in the  formulation of ascheme for the control of  the catching side of it.    43.  The British Herring Trade Association, which represents  themajority of the herring curers, has been able, during recent years, toexercise fairly effective control over  the  dates for the commencementof curing and the quantity cured at  East Anglia, and while it wouldbe preferable if such- control were fortified by statutory regulations, weare of opinion that the time is not yet opportune for the introductionof legislation  as  proposed and that  the  matter  should  be left  forconsideration at a later date.           (b) The development of  new types of drifter.   44.  In  the   course of  our discussions  we have given special consideration to  the questions raised  in paragraphs 225-232 of  theReport of  the Scott Committee  (summarised in paragraph  883  (80))regarding the desirability of some form of  State  assistance for  thedevelopment of  an improved type  of drifter.   We agree with  theCommittee in  thinking that this is a matter of particular importanceto the herring industry.   It is true that at  the present time, owing tothe contraction which has  taken place in the export  market for pickledherrings,  any expansion in  the catching power of the fleet would be extremely undesirable. Nevertheless, it is inevitable that in a fewyears  the  building of new vessels  for replacement purposes  will gradually become more necessary.  In  the meantime, there is no need to emphasise the  advantages which would be obtained from a reductionin costs by the development of a type  of vessel cheaper to build or tomaintain and operate than the steam drifter at present in use.   45.  A special interest, therefore, attaches to the experience whichhas been  obtained during the last  few years  with wooden vesselsdesigned for motor propulsion and fitted with Diesel  engines burningcrude  oil.   Several types  of  vessel  have  been built for  Scottishfishermen.  Many of them are of small size compared with the steamdrifter and  are intended  for use in drift  net fishing only  when  theshoals of herring are  fairly close to shore, being employed at other times in white fish seining or small  line fishing.   Such dual purpose
vessels are in a sense the  counterpart of the drifter trawlers which:have been built latterly in  England.  In both Scotland and Englandit is becoming more and more necessary for the herring fishermen totake up some supplementary form of fishing in addition to drifting.It  is,  perhaps, natural  that in England, where herring fishing  is toa considerable extent carried on by companies with substantial capital resources, this development should take the form  of a combination ofdrifting and  trawling.   The  vessels required are  larger than theordinary drifter and cost appreciably more to build.  In Scotland,  onthe other  hand, where the owners of the vessels are,  as  a rule, thefishermen themselves, the  demand is  principally directed towards a.type of vessel cheaper and smaller than the ordinary  drifter.   46.  The  possibilities  of  motor  propulsion  are not,  however,limited to the small vessel  of 40-50 feet keel.  It has also been usedin wooden drifters not much smaller in size than the  average steamdrifter.    Since  1929  four of these  vessels  have been built  forScottish  fishermen,  viz.,  &quot;Nautilus&quot; built in 1929 with  80-feetkeel and semi-Diesel  engine,  &quot;Bounteous Sea&quot;  launched in March1980 with a Bolinder engine,  &quot; Gleanaway &quot; launched  in September1980, and &quot;Efficient&quot;  launched  September  1981.  It  is  claimed that the construction cost  of these vessels  is smaller than  that ofthe steam drifter, that  their running  expenses are  lower, and  theirnet earnings  higher.   They  have  also  proved themselves  efficient and sea-worthy  under  a variety of fishing conditions.   47.  On.the other hand, there  is  room for a more critical  viewto be taken  of the possibilities of these boats.   The  lower capital&apos;cost  is  largely due to  the fact that these vessels  have been  builtof wood,  whereas,  under  prevailing  fashions,  steam drifters are normally built of steel, and it is suggested that there is no guarantee that over  a longer period  and in general  use  the running expensesof these boats would be found  to  be  as  low as  they have  hithertoproved.  There is, in  the first place, a  possibility that the  priceof oil  may  at some  time  in the  future  become somewhat  higher.A  more important consideration lies in  the uncertainty  whether, ifthese boats are  built in appreciable numbers, they would prove asreliable in the hands of the  average  fisherman  as they have  beenfound to be so far under the care of skilful and enthusiastic owners.It is  at  any rate  undeniable  that  motor  engines  are far  frompossessing the complete simplicity and  reliability of the steam engine..   48.  How serious  these  possible  drawbacks  might prove  inpractice  it is impossible to say.  But the importance to the  industry of this new development is such that we hope that every  opportunitywill  be taken of trying  out these  vessels by  the  test of actualexperience.   The Scott  Committee  suggested that experimental  workin this direction provided  a  suitable  field for State  assistance, assoon as financial circumstances permitted.   &quot;We  recognise that suchexperiments  are  desirable not only to demonstrate to the  general body  of fishermen the possibilities  of  the  modern motor  drifter, butalso to test different types of engines.   Before, however,  the institu-tion of any  scheme  on these lines is  considered, we  are of opinionthat, there is important preliminary work  to be done of a  kind towhich the existing facilities of Government  research institutions  are specially  adapted.   Wo understand that  valuable  results could beobtained at a cost that  would probably not exceed  1,000  if tests-were  carried out  by  the  National  Physical  Laboratory  in  the experimental  tank at Teddington,  with  a  view to  improving  the design of hulls and  propellers so as to secure more economical fuelconsumption, and greater  speed, efficiency, and sea-worthiness.  Weunderstand that  there are good prospects that such tests would leadto modifications  of  design which  would result  in  a  more efficientvessel and a decrease in the  engine power necessary.   The  bearingof any  improvement  of  this kind on  the  development of the motordrifter is  obvious.  We  are informed  by the Development Commis-sion  that  in their opinion this  is  an object which  is  eligible  fora  grant from the Development Fund.   The extent  to  which  the herring industry  should contribute towards the cost of  such investiga-tions would require to be considered if a grant from  the development fund  were found possible.
                   (o)  The marketing of kippers.    49.   While  the most serious and  important problems affecting &apos;the  herring  industry are those  concerned with the export market,the  Scott  Committee  observed  (paragraph  186) that the situation has  been considerably  aggravated by  the  decline which  has takenplace in the home consumption  of  herrings.  We agree  with themthat  anything which  could be  done to increase  this  consumption would obviously  be of  great benefit  to the industry.  Por example,the  various  experiments which  are  at present  being conducted inkippering processes at  the  Torry Research Station are  deserving ofevery encouragement.   50.   We  are, however, inclined to doubt whether the suggestions made in paragraphs 198 and 199 with  reference to the establish-ment of a national system of grading and  marking of kippers  andthe  imposition  of a  compulsory  levy on  the industry for theiradvertisement  will  be  found to  be  capable  of application  with advantage  at the present time.  In any case, we consider that  thisis not a matter  calling for action on the part of the Government,since  under  the  Agricultural  Produce  (Grading   and Marking)Amendment  Act, 1931, to which the Committee referred, it is opento the trade themselves to take the initiative if they so desire.                   IY. INSHORE  FISHERIES.      (a)  Amendment of the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888.    51.   The  Scott Committee  described  in  paragraphs 245-249  of their Report the system of regulation of the inshore fisheries and drew attention to the  fact that in one  important  respect it  is at present incomplete.  Although  by-laws  made by the  local regulating bodies, known  as  Sea Fisheries Committees,  are subject,  under  the  Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, to confirmation by the Minister  of Agriculture and  Fisheries,  the Minister  himself has  no power  to initiate by-laws or to  revoke or modify  those  which have  become obsolete.    The Scott Committee observed that  the absence  of 6uch powers  is attended by  obvious  disadvantages,  there being  cases  in which for one reason or another  by-lawTs have proved unsatisfactory  in practice.  They,  therefore,  recommended  that Parliament should  be invited  to amend  the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act,  1888, by giving power to the  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  to revoke -or modify  existing by-laws, and also to initiate such new by-laws  as he might from time to time consider necessary.    52.   The  suggestion that powrer to revoke or modify  existing by-laws  should be  conferred upon the  Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries has been made on various occasions  in the  past, but has always  been  threatened hitherto  with  strong  opposition from  the Association  of  Sea Fisheries Committees.  We understand, however, that  since  the publication  of  the Scott Committee&apos;s Report,  the association  have decided to arrange for  the introduction of a private member&apos;s Bill, giving  power   to  the Minister - of Agriculture  and Fisheries to revoke existing by-laws made under the  Sea Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888.    53.   Although the association have thus abandoned the opposition which they have hitherto offered to the granting of any powers of this kind  to the  Minister, it  will be  seen that  the legislation which they advocate  does  not  include  all that was  recommended  by the Scott Committee,  since no reference  is made  in it  to  the grant to him  of power to  initiate  new by-laws.  Nevertheless, we do  not regard  this omission  as a  point of  any substantial importance.   As the ScottCommittee observed, difficulty is at present mainly caused by existingby-laws which  have proved unsatisfactory in practice,  and it is  the power to revoke or modify these which is principally necessary.  We consider,  therefore, that the case would be sufficiently met if support were  given to  the legislation which it is proposed to bring forward onthis subject, giving to the Minister power similar to that which healready  possesses under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act,1928.
(b) Salmon fisheries;  need for additional powers of regulation  in                             Scotland.   54.  The Scott Committee described  in paragraphs 257-260  thedecline which has taken place during the last fifty years in the salmonfisheries in Scotland, which they ascribed principally to the operationof three causes,  pollution, over-netting,  and obstructions in riverspreventing the ascent  of  the  fish to the spawning  grounds.   Theproblems involved have not proved easy  to solve either in  scotland or in England.  But in Scotland, as the  Committee stated,  the diffi-culties have been accentuated by the inadequacy of the existing powersof the Fishery Board  for  Scotland.  Under  the  Salmon Fisheries(Scotland)  Acts of  1862  and 1868,  Scottish  salmon  fisheries  are administered by district boards elected by the fishery proprietors,  the fishery Board  for Scotland having no more than a general  power ofsuperintendence, which is expressly declared to be without prejudice tothe rights and  duties of the district boards.  The Fishery Board has,in fact,  no compulsory  powers of any kind, and can act only in  an advisory capacity.   It  may be  observed, moreover, that in manysalmon fishery  districts (70 out of 107) no district  board  has  as  yei:been constituted.   55.  In order  to remedy this situation  the  Scott  committee recommended that Parliament should be invited to confer upon  the fishery Board  for  Scotland various powers, which they enumerated.substantially similar to those  already possessed in England by  theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries, under  the Salmon and Fresh-water Fisheries Act, 1923, and  previous legislation  consolidated inthat measure.   In  view  of the fact  that in Scotland the existing-provisions  of the  law dealing with these matters  are  obsolete  andineffective, we  consider that the introduction at an early  date of aBill conferring  upon the Fishery Board for Scotland additional powers-of this kind is highly desirable.                    (c)  Purification of shellfish.            (i)  Home-grown mussels and other  shellfish.   56.  The Scott Committee referred in  paragraphs 271-282 of theirBeport to the pollution of  shellfish, with  special reference to musselsand  oysters.    57.   As regards  mussels  gathered in this country, they recom-mended that a Bill should be introduced  to empower local authoritiesto provide  tanks  and  other  apparatus together with all necessaryappliances for  cleansing  or sterilising shellfish, and to  charge  fortheir use.    58.   Such  a  Bill was introduced  during  the present session bya private member and with  the assistance of the Government  waspassed into law  as the Public Health (Cleansing  of Shellfish) Act,1932.    59.   It was   anticipated  by  the Scott  Committee  that   this measure would result in the re-opening of those shellfish beds whichhave been  conditionally  closed for public health reasons,  and thatit might render it practicable to apply a similar conditional closureto other beds  which are  polluted to some  extent, but with  regardto which the public health authorities have  hitherto been  reluctant to take such action. There has not been time so far for the Act to-operate, and  it  remains  to be  seen  whether,  in  existing financial conditions, local  authorities  will  avail themselves  of  these powersto any  considerable extent.    60.   The  representatives  of  the  Fisheries Department of  theMinistry  of Agriculture  and  Fisheries  and  of  the  development commission are  anxious  to  encourage  the  consumption of home-grown mussels.   For this purpose they  consider it essential to give-confidence to potential consumers  by  providing conditions which  willsubstantially eliminate risks  of  illness resulting from the consump-tion of mussels.   This object will not, in  their view, be attained by the recent Act alone, and  they  favour  the  prohibition  (which
would be  possible  under  the  existing  legislation  referred  to  inparagraph  64 below) of  the sale of mussels, after a given date, for human consumption unless they have been subjected to an approvedcleansing process.   The Ministry of Health  representatives  doubt,whether  the  available information as to the danger to public healthfrom  the consumption of uncleansed British mussels  from all partsof the coast is sufficient  to justify  such drastic action,  involving,as it  would,  the raising by local  authorities of substantial sums byloan where tanks are erected, and also some net annual expenditure,except in  cases  where  a  self-supporting  scheme is  found  possibleas at Conway.  In  this connection the Fisheries Department pointout that  the  trading accounts of the  Conway tanks, in spite of earlydifficulties  involving loss,  show up to date a net  profit of  98, andin the past season a net profit of  241.  In view, however, of the doubts expressed by the Ministry of Health, we are precluded  fromrecommending on public  health grounds,  that action in regard toBritish mussels should  be taken  at the present  time on  the  lines suggested  by  the Fisheries Department.  We  consider,  however,that  the situation should  be  kept  under constant review by  theDepartments concerned.            (ii) Imported  mussels and  other  shellfish.   61.  The Scott Committee went  on to discuss the question of imported mussels.  They  remarked that it would be anomalous totake elaborate  precautions to  safeguard the  consumer against  thedanger  of  eating  polluted  mussels if  gathered at home when  nosuch precautions  are  applied  to  the  part  of the supply which isgathered abroad.   They therefore  recommended that the importationof mussels  from foreign countries  should be prohibited except wherethey are subjected to an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country, and that at the same time arrangements should bemade with  the Irish  Free State  which will ensure the  quality ofthe mussels imported  from that country.   62.  Imported oysters, mussels and cockles mainly  come fromthe Irish Free State, France, the  Netherlands and  the United Statesof America.  Regulations  have been made by  the Irish Free StateGovernment prohibiting the distribution of shellfish from  the Louthand  Meath  layings, which are understood to be particularly liableto sewage pollution, unless the shellfish have been washed and relaidin sterilised or in  clean water for  a specified  period.  In the Nether-lands the layings are subject to Government control, and certifi-cates are issued with  exported shellfish that  they are from layings&apos;&apos; not exposed to any reasonable risk of pollution by sewage or otherobjectionable  filth.&quot;    The Fisheries   Department  are, however,apprehensive that shellfish, even if  clean at  the  time of despatch from the beds, may become contaminated in transit.   63.  We are,  however,  informed by the Ministry of Health thatthere is little evidence of  illness suspected  to be due to importedshellfish, although it  appears that on  several occasions in recentyears the  Fishmongers&apos;  Company have  condemned  consignments of Dutch mussels on  bacteriological grounds.  On  the  whole  theMinistry of Health do not consider that there is  a strong case,  on grounds of public  health,  for regulating the importation of shellfishin the manner suggested by the Scott  Committee.  Moreover, untileither  local authorities take advantage of  the recent Act enabling them to erect tanks for the cleansing of mussels,  or until the more stringent form of regulation discussed in paragraph  60 above, is adopted, the anomaly  apprehended by the Scott Committee does notarise.  But another anomaly does arise, namely, that certain shell-fish  beds are  closed by administrative  order,  while others,  possiblyno less polluted, are free to put their shellfish on the  market.   64.  If it  is ultimately decided to act on the Scott Committee&apos;recommendation as to imported mussels, regulations could be madeby the Minister of Health under  the Public Health (Regulations asto Food) Act,  1907,  prohibiting  the importation of mussels  (andpossibly  some other shellfish) for human consumption unless  theyare  consigned  to  an   approved  cleansing  establishment,  and     [7339]                                                u
prohibiting the  sale  by  retail  for human  consumption  of  suchimported shellfish unless they have been properly  cleansed at suchan establishment, whether set up by  local authorities  at  the  ports of entry or by importers.   65.   To make  such  regulations reasonably  effective  it  wouldbe necessary that all consignments of shellfish despatched from suchan establishment should be sealed  and should bear a  certificate  ofcleansing.    66.   As, however,  no cleansing establishment  other than  thatat Conway  exists at present, it  is  evident that regulations to theeffect recommended could not be brought into immediate operation.    67.   An alternative course would be to introduce a less drasticsystem  of control by issuing  regulations similar to those already  inforce in the case of imported milk.   Such  regulations might requireall importers of the specified  kinds  of shellfish to be registered withthe Port or Riparian Sanitary Authority, might impose a bacteriologicalstandard for all such shellfish (subject perhaps to an exception whichwould have no immediate  application  for  shellfish consigned to an approved cleansing establishment and dealt with as  indicated above),and empower  the  Authority to remove  from the register  eitherabsolutely  or  in respect of any  specified  source of   supply  anyimporter who  imported shellfish not - complying with  the prescribedconditions (such action amounting in effect  to a prohibition of furtherimportation).   We  are  doubtful of the  efficacy  of the  proposedmethod  of control of mussels by sampling and bacteriological tests andwe do not advocate the adoption of this scheme.    68.   It  is  impracticable to apply to imported mussels regulations(involving, e.g., inspection  and closure of beds) of the same type  asthose in- force  in regard  to home-grown  mussels.   It would not bepossible on grounds of public health  to require mussels imported fromabroad to be cleansed at the port  of arrival, unless it was at the sametime decided to require the cleansing of all home-grown mussels.  Thelatter policy would,  as  we have explained,  involve financial commit-ments which  we should  not  feel justified  in recommending at- thepresent  time,  and  for this reason  we  do  not consider that  actionin regard to imported mussels should be taken on the lines suggestedhy  the   Scott   Committee, although  we  all agree  that  such  action may  ultimately prove  desirable,  and some of us consider  it to bea matter of urgency.(d) Marketing difficulties of the inshore fisherman and  the need for                           co-operation.    69.   In common  with  other bodies  which  have  in  the  pastexamined the  position of the inshore fishermen, the Scott committee considered that the  principal  source of  their difficulties  is  to befound in  the  extreme individualism of their methods,  their lack ofcapital, and the small scale on  which  they work.   The  general scaleon which fishing is carried on has been so greatly enlarged in moderntimes  that the isolated producer whose  catch is only  a small  partof the total supply  is bound to meet with  great difficulties both inobtaining cheap siipplies, e.g.,  of ice, and  also in disposing  of hisfish at an advantageous price.    70.   The  Committee  were of opinion that the remedy for  this situation must be looked for to a great  extent in an increased measureof co-operation on the part  of the fishermen, not only in the buyingof provisions and  gear, but also in the sale  of fish.  They  admitted,however,  that the progress of co-operation -was hindered not only bythe conservatism of the men, but  also by the difficulty which  they-experience in many  cases  in breaking away from  local buyers towhom they are in debt.   The Fisheries Organisation Society, a body-formed   in 1914  under a  scheme   framed  by  the  Development&quot;Commissioners, had done valuable work in promoting the formationof local co-operative  societies, and the Committee believed that thescope of its activities could  be enlarged with advantage, particularly at  some of the larger inshore fishing ports.  This extension  of the
-society &apos;s work would no  doubt be much easier, were it possible toincrease its income, which at present amounted only to  1,200 perannum.    In  the  existing   financial  conditions,  however,   theCommittee did not  feel justified  in  recommending any increase inthe sum received  by the society from public funds.  They believed,however, that  the value  of the work done by the society  would be enhanced if it  could be brought into closer relation with that of the fisheries Department  of  the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.In particular, much  might be gained by associating the Department&apos;sdistrict fishery officers w-ith  work of the society.  In Scotland  alsothe  Committee  were  anxious to  see an  increased  measure ofco-operation  amongst  fishermen,  and expressed the hope that the fishery  Board for Scotland  would consider  the possibility  of takingfurther steps to promote  that end.    71.   We  fully agree with the conclusions of the Scott committee regarding  the need  for  co-operation  amongst  inshore fishermen.We  recommend  that  their  suggestion  for  a closer  association inEngland  and  Wales  of  the  work  of  the  Fisheries   OrganisationSociety  with  that of  the district fishery  officers of the  Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries should be adopted, and that department has undertaken to issue instructions accordingly.  As regards Scotland,we  are  informed  that  the Fishery Board for Scotland will  take  any steps in  the  future  which  may  prove possible  in the  directionindicated.              Y. HARBOURS  AND  RESEARCH.                          (a) Harbours.                      (i)  England and Wales.    72.   The position of the fishery  harbours in England and wales was discussed by  the  Scott  Committee in  paragraphs 307-322 oftheir Report.  Their  general conclusion  on the  subject was  thatwherever harbour authorities had sufficient funds at their disposalthe facilities provided were adequate to meet the needs of the  fishingpopulation.   This, however,  was not  the  case  with  the  inshorefishing  ports.  The harbour  authorities of  the  latter. were  largelycomposed of local  fishermen and often lacked the  financial resources and the administrative  and financial experience  necessary  for theproper management of the harbours.  Many of them were much in arrear with the repayment of the loans which they had received  fromthe  Development  Fund for  the  improvement  of their harbourworks.   In  the  case  of  five  harbour   authorities  in  Englandand Wales, the Development Commission  had  found it necessaryto remit debts in 1929  amounting to  over  15,000  which were  clearlyirrecoverable.    73.   The Scott Committee examined various proposals which hadbeen put forward  for the improvement of the existing position,  suchas the transfer of responsibility for  inshore  fishery harbours  to sea fisheries Committees or County Councils, or the creation of a  centralauthority to  undertake the maintenance and management of theseharbours.  The  Committee  considered  that  each  of  these proposalsinvolved difficulty  on one ground or another.   Their Report, however,contains no  reference to the  observations by  the Committee  on national Expenditure (the May  Committee) who, generally speaking,took the view  that where local harbour  authorities are  unable todefray  the  cost of necessary maintenance  work,  they should  be assisted  by the local municipality and not by the Exchequer.    74.   The conclusion of the Scott Committee was that there wouldbe  no  justification for  the  transfer  to the taxpayer  of  financial responsibility for  such an essentially local service as the  upkeep ofthese small fishery harbours.  The need for greater  co-ordinationof Government policj&apos; in this matter could, in their view,  be  metif the Development Commission were to undertake a general  survey of fishery harbours embracing consideration not only of the technical
and engineering problems involved, but also wider questions relating-to the economic position of  the  fishermen.   In this  way it mightbe possible, they thought, to concentrate the  grant of government assistance at a smaller number of ports, and thus, perhaps,  providethe stimulus necessary  to persuade  the inshore  fisherman to  adoptnew methods of marketing or even to move to the larger and betterequipped fishing ports along the coast.   75.  On the. above recommendation  of the Scott Committee theDevelopment Commission take the view, in which  we concur, thata general survey of the kind indicated is not necessary.  In dealingwith harbour  questions, however, the  Commission  will continue toundertake  in the future,  as they have done in the  past, surveys ofthe economic  requirements of particular stretches of  coast in caseswhere questions common to  several  harbours  arise, and where therelative importance  of  claims for  assistance  among  neighbouringharbours have to be considered.                          (ii) Scotland.    76.   The position of fishery harbours in Scotland was discussed by  the  Scott Committee in paragraphs 323-329 of their  Report,in which  they stated that since  the establishment of the  Develop-ment Fund in 1909  many improvement schemes had been carriedout both at the herring landing ports and at the home ports of thedrifters.  The war and  the depression in the herring industry which followed it  had prevented the completion of the schemes which hadbeen planned and  the  execution of  other necessary  improvements,and had involved many  of the harbours in a load of debt  beyond their power  to  bear.    Measures  had, however,  been  taken orinstituted  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  which would  materiallyrelieve  the debt situation and would  lead to substantial improvements in the  condition of  the harbours.    77.   In view, however,  of  the  large amount of public moneyexpended on  the Scottish fishery harbours  (which was also referredto by the  May Committee last year), the Scott  Committee regarded it as essential that steps should be taken to  guard against any failure on the  part of the local authorities to keep  the harbours in  a properstate of repair.   They thought  that  an early opportunity shouldbe taken  to obtain from Parliament  such statutory pow*ers as mightbe necessary  and  practicable  to  enable  the  Fishery Board  for Scotland  to ensure this.  In particular, they  were  informed  that difficulty  had frequently been experienced in constituting authorities for small  harbours  in  Scotland, owing to the cost of the statutoryprocedure involved-  They understood  that the Scottish authorities had  had  under  consideration  the  promotion  of  legislation  tofacilitate   the  acquisition  of   small   fishery  harbours   by   localauthorities, and they recommended that an early opportunity  shouldbe taken  of  asking  Parliament to pass  legislation to this  end.Further,  they were of opinion that the proposed legislation  should make provision for some simple method by which harbour authorities might  obtain powers to undertake  works, and by  which existing- harbour provisional  orders  might be amended  on such matters  as the alteration of schedules of dues.    78.  We  fully agree  with the  opinion expressed by the Scott Committee that some addition to the existing provisions of the law on this subject is desirable.   We recommend, therefore, that Parlia- mentary  time should be found for the legislation  dealing with this subject which, we understand, the  Secretary of State for  Scotland has in preparation.                           (b)  Research.    79.  The section of the Scott Committee&apos;s Report (paragraphs 331- 369) dealing  with the subject of fishery research is chiefly descriptive and does not, therefore, call for special comment.  We desire,  however, to associate ourselves with the  hope expressed by  them, at  the con- clusion of paragraph 348, that, in spite of the financial difficulties of
the present time,  funds will continue to be provided on an adequate scale in order that the important work of fisheries reseai-ch may not be hampered.    80.   As regards the comment contained in paragraph 841, on thequestion of the size of the staff available for research  work by the fishery Board for Scotland, we consider that this  is a matter whichshould be reserved for discussion between the Board and the Treasury.    81.   In an earlier section of their Report (paragraphs 135-141) theScott Committee discussed the possibility of securing a wider applica-tion of the results of research to the problems of the fishing industry.They referred  to  the  important scientific  work on the  fundamentalproblems  underlying fish preservation, which  is being carried out bythe Food Investigation Board of the Department of Scientific  andIndustrial Research.  We concur in their view that this work shouldbe continued and expanded as opportunities allow.  We agree also thatit would  be of great  advantage  if  the  industry were  willing toco-operate in large-scale experimental  applications of the results of research in fish preservation.   xJ    82.  We are,  however, less  convinced of the  suitability of  themethods which they suggest for promoting such co-operation,  namely,the establishment of a research association similar to those set up withthe assistance of the Million Fund under the scheme administered bythe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, or, alternatively,of a board, with statutory powers to impose a levy on the industry forthe promotion of research and other matters of common interest.  Wethink that the  case would  be met,  if the Fisheries Departments andthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research were to continue their policy of drawing the attention of the  fishing industry to  the valuable benefits offered by the results of scientific discovery.             YI.-SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS.   83.  We  summarise our  conclusions  on the  recommendations contained in  the Report of the  Committee on the  Fishing industry of  the   Economic  Advisory  Council  (the  Scott  Committee)  asfollows :           &apos;              Y*&apos;KITE  FISH  AND TRAWLING.(1)  Conditions  of employment  and  remuneration  In  the trawling                            Industry.(a)  Conditions in regard to engagement of crews and form of settling-      sheets.   The  Scott Committee  recommended       that Parliament  should be invited  to amend the  provisions   of the Merchant  Shijrping Act,  1894, in  relation to the employ-   ment of fishermen as members of creics of fishing vessels in the   following respects :     (i)  It should  be made compulsory  for the signing on  and off          of the  crews of  fishing vessels to  take  place at Board of          Trade  offices  in the presence of  a Stiperintendent  of a          Mercantile Marine Office or his  deputy.    (ii)  It should  be made compulsory  for oivners  to  give  to  each          member of the  crew of a fishing vessel  who is paid partly          by  share in the  profits  a detailed settling-sheet in  the          form  now  furnished to skippers and  mates.   (hi)  It should  be made compulsory  for the owner of a fishing          vessel  to furnish to the Superintendent a certified true  copy          of the settling-sheet issued  to the skipper, mate  and crew.          Failure to do so  should be made  an offence subject  to a          substantial fine.    [7389]                                                 E
    (iv)  The Board of Trade  should he given such powers as may          be necessary to enable Superintendents to satisfy themselves          that  settling-sheets submitted  to  them represent  a true          statement of the cost of a  voyage and of the proceeds          therefrom.   Superintendents should be empowered to make          such  inquiries from time to time, and to take any  necessary          action against the owners, without waiting  for complaints          to be received.   We agree that some amendments to the provisions of the MerchantShipping Act, 189$, are necessary, but we think that these  amend-ments should be limited to the following:     (1) Owners should be required to exhibit for the information of all         members of the crew,  paid partly by a share in the profits,         at the time  and place at which settlements are made, a         detailed  settling-sheet  in  the  form in  which  it  is now         furnished to skippers and mates.    (2) Owners should also be required to furnish to the  Superintendent         of the Mercantile Marine Office, as soon as possible after         settlement,   a  certified true copy of  the  settling-sheet.         Failure to do so should be made  an offence subject to a         substantial fine.    If these amendments to the existing law  (which involve  no newcharge  on public funds and are  substantially  the  same as thosesuggested by the Scott Committee in recommendations (ii) and  (iii)above) were made, it would be unnecessary to confer upon the Boardof Trade the additional powers contemplated in recommendations  (i)and (iv), which would, moreover, necessitate a considerable increasein  expenditure  by the  Board  in  respect  both  of  accommodation and salaries, and  would place an  appreciable financial burden on  theIndustry.  (Paragraphs 5-15 and 17.)    (Such  amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act,  1894, wouldin  the  ordinary  course  apply only  to  men employed  on steamtrawlers of 25-tons gross and upwards.   If, however, the point were raised in Parliament, there  appears  to  be no  serious  objection totheir being  extended so  as to include  men employed on  certainclasses  of drifters and liners.)(b) Provisions in regard to life-saving appliances.    The  Scott  Committee  recommended        that the requirements contained  in the Merchant Shipping Act,    1894, in regard to the provision of life-saving  appliances on fishing    vessels should be revised so as to be applicable to modern fishing    vessels in modern conditions, and that power should be given to the    Board of Trade to vary them from time to time, as circumstances    require.    We agree that it is desirable that these matters should be governed by  up-to-date regulations,  and  we,  therefore,  concur  in   thisrecommendation.   (Paragraphs 16 and 17.) (c) Sale of fish by auction at the ports.    The Scott  Committee  recommended-        that Parliament should  be  asked to confer  upon  the Board    of Trade  power  to prescribe by  order  in  cases  of  ports where    they  consider such a  course desirable that the  sale by  auction    of trawled fish which  affects the settling-sheets  between  owners,    skippers and  crews   should  only  be  conducted  by  salesmen    independent of the owners  of the fishing vessels.    As a result of our consideration of this question, and of an Inquiry which we addressed to the Railway Clearing House, we  have reached the  conclusion that  the  evidence in regard to  the prevalence  of dishonest practices in the sale of fish at the ports oannot be considered sufficient  to  justify legislation of the kind proposed by the scott Committee.   (Paragraphs 18-21.)
(d) Suggested  establishment  of  machinery for collective discussion      between owners and men.   The Scott Committee suggested  in paragraph  67 of their Reportthat it was desirable that in the fishing industry arrangements shouldbe made for the setting up,  as  has been done in other industries,of some form  of machinery for collective  discussion  between  theowners on the  one hand and the men on the other.   In view of the rudimentary stage  at present reached by trade  union organisation in the industry, we see no way in which the suggestion ofthe Committee could be carried into effect.  (Paragraphs 22 and 23.)                     (2) Billingsgate market.(a) Sales on commission.   The  Scott  Committee considered  the  following  complaints inregard to the conditions at  Billingsgate market:     (i) That commission salesmen  frequently failed to return to the          sender the actual  price  at which the  fish had  been sold.   (ii) That the  Billingsgate list of &quot;daily prices&quot;  did  not reflect          with sufficient accuracy  the  actual prices at  which fish          had been sold.   To deal with these alleged abuses, the Committee recommended -   (a) that Parliament  should  be asked to  approve  legislation          imposing  restrictions  in regard  to the  sale  of  fish on          commission in wholesale markets, on lines similar to those          in force in the central food markets of Paris.   (by that &quot;daily  prices&quot;  should be compiled on a basis which          was  not  open  to  the  objections mentioned,  and  that,  if          necessary,  legislative powers  should be  taken to see that          this was  done.   We concur in  the recommendation that legislation should be intro-duced to deal with the first of these complaints.  We think, however,that it would  be sufficiently wide  in scope if it  were framed  on thelines of the Horticultural Produce  (Sales on Commission)  Act, 1926,to which the  Committee themselves  referred and which  has,  weunderstand, been found to provide  a satisfactory remedy for a  similarsituation in wholesale  markets  for horticultural produce.   If such legislation were enacted  we consider that it would  be unnecessary  totake further action on the subject of &quot; daily prices,&quot; unless  it appeared that the  publication of this list in its present  form tended to inflateretail prices. (Paragraphs 2$-27.)(b) The extension of Billingsgate market.   Broadly,  we are in agreement with the course of  the  argumentcontained in paragraphs 97-108 of the  Scott  Committee&apos;s Reportin regard to the need for  relieving the congestion at Billingsgate.   The situation has,  however,  been changed by the adoption by theGovernment  of the Committee&apos;s  recommendation that restrictions should  be  imposed on the import  of  white  fish, and we consider,therefore, that no action could usefully be taken by the Government inthis matter until sufficient time  has elapsed to make clear what  effect this policy will have on conditions in the market.   In  any ease, thesuggestion put forward  by  the  Scott  Committee,   that financialassistance  should be  afforded to the Billingsgate extension  scheme..on the  lines adopted  by the Government in assisting other publicutility schemes,  is not now. practicable in view of the decision ofthe Government not  to ask Parliament to renew  the  Development(Loan Guarantees and  Grants) Act, 1929,  which expires this  month.(Paragraphs  28-30.)[7339]
                    (3) Imports of white flsh.   The Scott Committee  recommended        that the question of imposing restrictions on  the  imports  of   white fish, which amount to the substantial figure of  8,000,000,   should be considered by His Majestifs Government in connection   with any steps which  may be  taken with a view to improving   the balance of trade.   This recommendation has been met by the decision of the Govern-ment to impose a  duty on the import of white fish.  (Paragraph 31.)                     (4)  Exports of dried fish.   The Scott  Committee recommended        that the English  and Scottish Fisheries Departments  should   confer with the Department of Overseas Trade  on the question   of initiating special inquiries with a view to taking advantage of   the large potential markets for dried fish and fish meal for  human   consumption in Africa  and the East.   We  are  informed by the  Department  of  Overseas Trade  thatinquiries conducted into  this matter, both  recently and in the past,have  shown  that the fish consumed  in  Africa and the East is obtained,  for  the most  part,  from local  fishing grounds or from sources of supply less distant than the United Kingdom.   In these circumstances, we consider that no useful  purpose wouldtoe  served  by  a  further inquiry such  as that  suggested  in  thisrecommendation.   (Paragraph 32.)  (5) Need for further information on the marketing of white fish.   The Scott  Committee recommended        that  as  soon as  financial conditions permitted,  a systematic   marketing inquiry shoidd be  undertaken on lines w/iic/i had been   suggested to that Committee by the English and  Scottish Fisheries   Departments.   This proposal,  as originally  conceived,  required the appointmentof special investigators, and  the  Departments recognised that  thenecessary expenditure could not  be incurred in  existing financial conditions.  We are informed, however, that after further considera-tion  the Departments have reached the  conclusion that  an investiga-tion  on these lines could  be undertaken  without  addition  to theirexisting staff and resources.  We, therefore, recommend that  the twoFisheries Departments should carry out such an inquiry as  soon  aspossible.  (Paragraphs 33-35.)            (6)  Surveying of new fishing grounds.The Scott Committee recommended     that  the  survey   of   new  fishing  grounds  by  H.M.S.Challenger,  now temporarily  postponed  on  account  of financial conditions, should be put in hand as soon as these became some-what easier and  without  waiting  until there  was  an  actualshortage of  white fish.We concur In this recommendation.   (Paragraphs 36-38.)
                 HERRINGS AND  DRIFTING.               (7) The regulation of the export trade.    The Scott Committee recommended        that Parliament should be asked  to provide for the establish-    ment of a  Board representing registered producers, i.e., curers    and exporters, empowered inter alia to regulate the periods during    which herrings should be pickled in Great Britain, and to prohibit    the  export  of British herrings outside the  period prescribed  by    the  Board.    Considerable changes  have taken place recently in the situationin  the  herring  industry, and we are  of opinion that the time is notopportune fcr the introduction of legislation such  as that proposed, andthat the matter should be left for consideration at a later date.  (Para-graphs 39-$3.)            (8)  The development of new types of drifter.    In paragraphs  225-232  of their Report  the Scott Committee suggested  that,  as soon  as  financial  conditions permitted,  State assistance  should be granted towards the  development of new  types of motor drifter with  Diesel or semi-Diesel engines.    Before, however, the institution of any scheme on these lines  is considered, we are of opinion that there is important preliminary work to be done in improving the design of hulls and propellers of fishing vessels so as to secure more economical fuel consumption, and greaterspeed, efficiency, and  seaworthiness.    We understand that  valuable results could be obtained if tests could be carried out  at a cost which would probably not exceed  1,000 by the National Physical Laboratory in the experimental tank  at Teddington.   We  are informed by the Development  Commission that in  their  opinion this is an  object which is eligible  for a grant  from the Development Fund.  It would be  a  matter for later consideration what contribution the herring industry should  make towards the cost of such investigations if  a grant  from  the  Development Fund  were  found possible.   (Para- graphs 44-48.)                   (9) The marketing of kippers.    The  Scott Committee suggested in  paragraphs  198 and  199 oftheir Report that consideration  should be given to  the  possibilityof establishing a national system of grading and marking of kippers,and of  imposing a  compulsory levy  on the industry  for  theiradvertisement.    We consider that this is not a  matter calling for action on the partof the Government, since under the Agricultural Produce (Grading andMarking) Amendment Act,  1931, it is open to  the trade themselvesto take the initiative if they so desire.  (Paragraphs 49 and  50.)                 INSHORE  FISHERIES.(10) Amendment  of the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act,  1888.The Scott Committee recommended     that Parliament should be invited to amend the Sea FisheriesRegulation  Act,   1888,  by  giving power  to  the Minister  ofAgriculture  and Fisheries  to revoke or modify  existing  by-lawsmade under that  Act, and also to initiate such new  by-laws  ashe might from time to time consider necessary.
((11) Salmon fisheries:  need  for  additional  powers of regulation  in                            Scotland.   The Scott  Committee  recommended       that Parliament should he invited to confer upon  the Fishery   Board  for Scotland powers substantially  similar to those  already   possessed by the Ministry of Agriculture  and Fisheries under the   Salmon  and  Freshwater   Fisheries  Act,   1928,   and previous   legislation consolidated in that measure.   In view of the fact that in Scotland the existing provisions of thelaw dealing with these matters are obsolete and ineffective, we considerthat the introduction at an early  date of a  Bill conferring upon the fishery Board for Scotland additional powers of this  kind is highly desirable.   (Paragraphs 54 and 55.)                 (12) The purification of shellfish.(a) Home-grown mussels and other shellfish.   The Scott Committee recommended        that  a Bill shmdd be introduced to  empower local authorities   to provide tanks and other  apparatus, together ivith all necessary   appliances, for cleansing or sterilising shellfish, and  to  charge   for their tise.   This recommendation has  been met by the recent passage into law of the Public Health (Cleansing of Shellfish) Act, 1982.  Therehas not been  time so far for this  Act to operate.   We considerthat the situation should be kept under constant review by the Depart-ments concerned.   (Paragraphs 56-60.)(b) Imports of mussels and other shellfish.   The Scott Committee recommended        (i)  That His  Majestifs Government should invite Parliament   to pass  legislation prohibiting the  importation  of  mussels from   foreign countries,  except in cases  where they  are subjected  to-   an approved cleansing process after their arrival in this country.       (ii) That at the same time arrangements should be made with   the Irish Free State ivlvich tvould ensure the quality of the mussels   imported from that country.   It  is  impracticable  to  apply to  imported  mussels regulations(involving, e.g., inspection  and closure of beds)  of  the same type asthose in force in regard to home-grown  mussels.  It would  not  bepossible, on grounds of public health, to require mussels imported fromabroad to be cleansed at the port of arrival, unless it was at the sametime decided to require the cleansing of all home-grown mussels.  Thelatter policy would, as we  have explained in paragraph 60, involve-financial commitments which in existing circumstances we should not feel justified in recommending, and for this reason we  do not consider-that  aotion  in regard to  imported  mussels  should be taken  at  thepresent time on the lines suggested by the Scott  Committee, although we all agree that suoh aotion may ultimately prove desirable and someof us consider it to be a matter  of urgency.  (Paragraphs 61-68.)   We consider that the case would be sufficiently met if the Govern-ment were to give facilities in Parliament to the private member&apos;s Bill,for the introduction of which, we are informed, the Association of sea fisheries  Committees propose to arrange.  This Bill will provide forthe grant to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of power  to revoke, but not to initiate, by-laws made under the Act of 1888.  (Para-graphs 31-53.)
 (13) Marketing difficulties of the inshore fisherman and the need for                           co-operation.    The Scott Committee recommended        that, xcith a view to fostering co-operation among the inshore    fishermen, arrangements should be made for the closest co-opera-    tion between the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agricul-    ture and Fisheries and the Fisheries Organisation Society, and,    m  particular,  for the  association of the Department&apos;s district    fishery officers  tuith  the work of  that Society.    We concur in this proposal and the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries have undertaken to issue the necessary instructions to their district fishery officers.  As regards Scotland we are  informed that the fishery Board will take any steps in the future which  may  prove possible to foster co-operation among fishermen.  (Paragraphs 69-71.)                HARBOURS  AND  RESEARCH.                          (14) Harbours.(a) England and Wales.   The Scott Committee recommended        that a general survey of fishery harbours should be undertaken   forthwith by  the Development Commission in consultation with   the  English and Scottish Fisheries  Departments,  the  survey to   embrace  consideration not  only of  the  engineering and other   technical problems involved,  but also wider questions relating to   the  economic position.of the fishermen.   On this  recommendation the Development  Commission take the&quot;view, in which we concur, that a general survey of the kind indicatedIs not necessary.  We consider that  the case would be sufficiently metif, in dealing with harbour questions, the Commission were to under-take periodically  surveys of the  economic requirements of particularstretches of coast, in cases where questions common to several harboursarise  and where the relative importance of claims for assistance amongneighbouring harbours have to be considered.  (Paragraphs  72-75.)(b) Scotland.    The  Scott Committee recommended        (a)  that  Parliament  should   be  invited  to enact  legislation    facilitating the  acquisition of  small  fishery  harbours by local    authorities.       (b)  that the  legislation  referred to in (a) above should  include    the provision of a  simple  method  by which  harbour  authorities    might obtain powers to undertake works,  and by  which existing    harbour provisional orders  might be  amended on  such matters    as the  alteration of  schedules of dues.    We fully agree with the opinion  expressed by the Scott  Committeethat some  addition to the existing provisions of the law on this subject is desirable. We recommend that parliamentary time should be found for the Bill  dealing with this  subjeot  whioh,  we  understand, the secretary of State for Scotland has in preparation.  (Paragraphs 76-78.)                          (15) Research.   We  desire to associate ourselves with the hope expressed  by theScott Committee at the conclusion of paragraph 848 of their Eeport,that in spite of  the  financial  difficulties of the present time funds
will continue to be provided on an adequate scale in  order that theimportant work of fisheries research may not be hampered.   (NOTE. As regards the  question  discussed  in  paragraph  841      concerning the  size of the staff available for  research  work      by the  Fishery  Board for  Scotland, we consider that this is      a  matter which  should be reserved for discussion between the      Board and the  Treasury.)   We concur also in the view expressed by  the Scott Committeethat the important  scientific work  on the  fundamental  problemsunderlying fish preservation,  which is being carried out by the  FoodInvestigation Board of the Department of Scientific  and industrial research, should  be  continued and expanded as opportunities allow.(Paragraphs 79-82.)                  Signed on behalf of  the  Committee,                                 A. F, HEMMING, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,      August 9,  1982.
