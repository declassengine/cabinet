October 1932.SECRET.CP. 300 (32).                                              Copy No.........../.......                                   CABINET.  Memorandum for the Cabinet  by the  Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs and                         the Secretary of State for India.Question of the Reply to be given  to an  Enquiry received  fromthe Afghan  Government  as  to the  attitude  of  His  Majesty&apos;s         Government if the  Soviet  attacked Afghanistan.o c o   1. Since the accession of King Nadir Shah at the end of 1929, the attitude of the  Attitude of AfghaAfghan Government towards His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India  Govt. towardshas been one of marked and  active friendship.  This attitude appears to be largely  to^&apos;rds0Sov?etdactuated by a realisation of a community of interest as between Afghanistan  and  Govt.India, both in controlling the  turbulent tribes on either side of the common frontier and  in  guarding against the  subversive activities  of the  Communist International.It has already been of great value in assisting the Government of India  to  dealsuccessfully with the disturbances which have occurred on the North-West Frontierduring  the last two  years.   At the same time,  the Afghan Government,  thoughevidently distrustful of Soviet policy, have  been anxious to maintain correct  and,so far as  possible, friendly  relations  with the Soviet  Government.  Nevertheless,their Anglophile policy has  led  to frequent complaints by the  Soviet Government,of lack of  friendliness.  The  Soviet have made a number of demands on the AfghanGovernment which the latter  do not consider it to be in the interests of Afghanistanto accept.  There  is,  however, always  a  danger  of  their  being intimidated  intocompliance with such demands through fear of the Soviet and on  account of theirnervousness of  military aggression on their northern frontier.   The fact that thisfrontier was actually violated  by a Soviet force in 1930 shows that such fears  cannotbe dismissed as  altogether idle.   2. On 22nd April 1931, Faiz Muhammad, the Afghan Foreign Minister, enquired  Afghan Govt.&apos;sof Sir R. Maconachie,  the British Minister at Kabul, what the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s  ^[ry in AprilGovernment and of the Government of  India would be in  the event of war between russia and Afghanistan.  He  asked whether, in the event  of unprovoked aggression by the Soviet, Afghanistan  could count on any kind of support  from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and stated that,  without knowledge of the answer to this question, theforeign policy of his Government must remain fluid and opportunist, necessitating an attitude of surrender towards  any demand which the Soviet Government might make and  press home.    3. After  careful  consideration of  the  matter  by  the Ministers  concerned  H.M.Govt.&apos;s reply,(Mr. Henderson and Air. Benn), Sir R.  Maconachie was instructed to give a  reply,&quot;3&quot;&apos; July 1931-the main substance of which was that, since British interests include the maintenanceof  a  strong,  independent and  friendly  Afghanistan,  His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentnaturally could not regard  with indifference unprovoked aggression by a  foreign power against a friendly Afghanistan, but that the exact  steps to be taken  in that event must depend upon the circumstances of the  moment.  The  reply also includedan explanation of the relevant provisions of the Covenant of the  League of Nations.Faiz Muhammad at the time expressed no dissatisfaction with this reply.   4. Since that date Soviet  demands  on the Afghan Government and  complaints  Further enquiry inof their unfriendly attitude have  been pressed with increasing insistence.   On  29th  March 1932.March 1932 the Afghan Prime Minister (Muhammad Hashim, brother of King Nadir)invited Sir R. Maconachie to a long interview with himself  and with  Faiz Muhammad;At this interview,! after referring  to the change in Soviet-Afghan relations since the  * See Foreign Office telegram No. 80, of 24th July 1931, which is annexed (Appendix I).  t The relevant passages of Sir R.  Maconacliie&apos;s  note of the  conversation are  annexed in full(Appendix II).     1280    60  10.32                                                      A

They  include, besides manyImprobability of a soviet attack.Afghan Govt.should be advisednot to conclude anobjectionable com-aiercial treaty. uestion of reply  be given toAfghan Govt.&apos;s enquiry of last arch. demands others      - (i)  Renewal of the agreement, which had been  granted by Amanullah but has     since lapsed, providing for a Russian air service between Termez and Kabul.       (ii) Discussion of a project for a. through air mail service from Russia through     Afghanistan to India.  (Though  this project  is ostensibly commercial, it  would     for  both political and strategic reasons involve grave danger to British interests.)       (iii) The  conclusion of a commercial  treaty,  involving  a  system of  State     exchange of goods and extra-territorial  rights for Soviet  trade  officials  and     premises.  Faiz  Muhammad stated that this  meant a  network  of spies and     propagandists all over Afghanistan up to the Indian border.    The  Soviet are particularly insistent in their demand for the commercial treaty.    5. Faiz Muhammad stated that the Afghan  Government have hitherto rejected  or evaded  these demauds, but  are  in  doubt whether  they can continue this attitude indefinitely,  and what  they  are to do  if the  Soviet apply  pressure to  obtain the commercial treaty.   In  conclusion, the  Afghan Ministers asked for information  to enable them to appreciate their own position and that of neighbouring Governments, viz.:        (1) What was the  political situation  in Russia, and, in particular, were the     Soviet in a position to attack Afghanistan &apos;?       (2) If the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, what would  be the  attitude  of His     Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, or the League of Nations ? They stated that these  questions were  vital and urgent, since  on. the  answers  to them would depend the attitude of  the Afghan  Government towards the Soviet  in future and the possibility of their maintaining their present relations, as they sincerely desired to do, with His Majesty&apos;s Government.    6. As regards the situation in the U.S.S.R. (question (1) above), a memorandum has been prepared  for Sir R. Maconachie to use  in giving  oral information to the Afghan Government.  That memorandum, with which it is not  necessary to trouble the Cabinet,  brings out that, so far as our information shows, there is little likelihood of the Soviet attacking Afghanistan in the near future.  Moreover (though what the Afghans fear is, of course, that repeated refusals of R\issia&apos;s demands will place such a  strain  on  Russo-x\fghan relations  as  ultimately  to  endanger peace), it  seems particularly improbable  that  the  Soviet w^ould  take military action in order to obtain a commercial treaty or to enforce compliance with their other recent demands.    7. In  these  circumstances, it is  thought that we  can safely advise the Afghan Government  not to allow themselves to be pressed into the conclusion of an objection- able commercial treaty.   A treaty of the kind desired  by the Soviet would involve an  extensive system of  Soviet State  trading agencies,  with  extra-territorial  rights, throughout Afghanistan, and  would  obviously be contrary to British as  well as to Afghan interests.  It would lessen Afghanistan&apos;s power of resistance to economic and consequent political  penetration, and, what is of more immediate importance, it wouldgive  greatly increased  opportunities  for  Bolshevik propaganda and intrigue  in afghanistan  and on  the Indian frontier.   The Government of India  have  stated in atelegram of 26th August that  they are convinced  that  the establishment of russian trade agencies in important  Afghan towns  would  be extremely dangerous  to thepeace of  India  and of  Afghanistan.   The Government of India have  accordingly recommended that the Afghan Government should be  advised (a)  to resist uncom-promisingly any suggestion of the establishment of  Soviet trade agencies elsewherethan at the Afghan-Soviet frontier or  at Kabul, and (6) to refuse to allow a  tradeagency at Kabul unless the Soviet are prepared to give in exchange concessions of realcommercial advantage to Afghanistan.  It is proposed to authorise Sir R. Maconachieto give advice to the Afghan Government on these lines.    8. The fact that we  are in a position to  reassure  the  Afghan  Government asregards the immediate danger of a Soviet attack does not make it less  necessary toprovide some answer to the Afghan Governments second enquiry,  and it is a matterof some difficulty to decide what that  answer should be.   The matter  has been under careful consideration  at the Foreign Office and India Office, in consultation with Sir R. Maconachie, who  has been in England  on leave  this  summer and is due to sail on his return to  Kabul on 20th October.
353    9. It should be noted, in the first place, that the Defence of India Committee of1927, whose report was approved by the Cabinet of that time, assumed (paragraph 41of their report) that Russian action against Northern  Afghanistan would, in fact, inthe last resort be followed by a declaration of war by this country.   But that report is now five years old, and it is felt that the questions dealt  with therein are in need of re-examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence.  There  has, however, been no prospect of its being practicable to xmdertake such re-examination before reaching a decision as to  the answer which the Afghan Government will expect to their enquiry as soon as Sir R. Maconachie returns to Kabul next month.  The imcertainty (pending a new investigation by the Committee of Imperial Defence) whether policy can stillbe  shaped  in  accordance  with  the  assumptions  of 1927  somewhat increases  thedifficulty of replying to the Afghan  Governments  enquiry (though, of course, it is unlikely that in any  event it would be  desirable to  acquaint  them  with  thoseassumptions).  It is clear, however, that we  cannot give a promise of armed support to Afghanistan.    10.  The question then  arises  whether  we  should  confine  our  reply  to  vagueassurances  of  British  interest such  as  have  already  been given to the  AfghanGovernment in 1931.  We can certainly repeat these assurances, and we can add anallusion to the possibility that  the  position of Afghanistan  might, be at least morallystrengthened  if  she joined  the  League  of Nations  (there  would be a  danger ofmisleading the Afghans if we put  the case for  joining the League  higher than this).But the Afghan Government, in  making their  present  inquiry,  remarked that  theprevious reply had not been  very  definite.   They have accordingly now again asked what would be the attitude  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government, and-for the purpose of deciding to what   extent  they  would  be   justified  in  resisting Soviet demandsdetrimental to  their own and  our  interests they are  evidently anxious  to  know on what measure of support they could definitely count  from His Majesty&apos;s government if the Soviet took unprovoked military action.   The fact that, of King Nadir Shah&apos;sbrothers, one, who was Ambassador at Moscow, has recently returned to Afghanistan,and another, who  was previously Minister in  London, is  now  proceeding  there,suggests that the  Afghan  Government will press  their inquiry as soon  as Sir R.Maconachie returns to his post in a month&apos;s time.    11. Sir R. Maconachie  considers that in the absence of any sufficiently  definiteassurance, there is a real risk that the Afghans, under fear of aggression, may feelconstrained to yield to the Soviets demands, and in  particular to their demand for  acommercial treaty, the danger of which has already been explained.   In view of  this risk, it is tkotight desirable to  authorise him,  at  his discretion, if  the  AfghanGovernment are not satisfied  with general  statements, to give a specific assurance inthe following terms, viz., that, if  Russia  invaded Afghan territory for  the purpose ofpermanent occupation  or to provoke  a Russo-Afghan war, and provided  that suchRussian action were clearly unprovoked by any action  on  the part of the AfghanGovernment, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, if diplomatic interventionfailed,  to  break off diplomatic  and  official commercial relations  with  the SovietGovernment.   But, in  order  to prevent the Afghan Government reading  too muchinto this assurance, it is proposed that it  should  be coupled with the emphatic caveatthat  we cannot go further towards  defining  our attitude  in advance, and  that thequestion whether  any  further action  would  be taken would  depend  entirely oncircumstances at the time.  If the Afghan Government should enquire whether the severance  of diplomatic relations would not be likely to lead on to a state  of war,Sir R. Maconachie  should refuse  to add anything to  the statements already made byhim.  It is also proposed that the  whole of the communication to be made by Sir R.Maconachie should be governed by a  general caveat that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsreplies to the Afghan inquiry are to be regarded as  holding good only while relevantconditions remain materially the same as  at present.    12. The Government of  India have been consulted,   and  strongly  support41the proposal that  Sir  R. Maconachie  should  be authorised to give the  specificassurance.   They  have also made some further  suggestions.   Some of  these are sufficiently covered, it is  thought, by the draft despatch  which it  is proposed to address to Sir R. Maconachie,  and  others will be dealt with separately.    .13. We do  not consider  that  a  limited and contingent assurance of the  kind proposed could be  held to amount  to a &quot;commitment &quot;to the Afghan Government in    3 See Government of India&apos;s telegram  of 10th September 1932, which is annexed (Appendix III).Impossibility ofpromising armedsupport.Improbability thatgeneral statements&apos;will be sufficientto satisfy AfghanGovt.Suggested specificassurance.Govt. of India&apos;views.Question whetherthe suggestedassurance amountsto a commitment.
the sense in which that word has been employed in reply to questions in Parliament asto the extent of the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government to foreign Governments.    14. Sir R. Maconachie considers  that, if  a statement of the kind  proposed inparagraph 11 above were made with, care, and with emphasis  on the necessity for avoiding all unnecessary provocation  of the Soviet Government, the Afghan Govern-ment, who are extremely.cautious, not to say timid, in all their dealings with Russia,would not be likely  to draw any dangerous conclusions from it or to alter  theirpresent correct  attitude towards  the Soviet,  and  that it might  turn the  scale in preventing them from taking some step, such as the conclusion of a trade agreementopening up Afghanistan to Soviet commercial and political penetration, the preventionof which  is  at  present regarded as a vital part of our policy on the  North-west frontier of India.    The proposals in which we would invite our colleagues&apos; concurrence may be briefly summarised as follows :        (1) The Afghan Government should  be  informed  that in  the  opinion of His    Majesty&apos;s Government there is no immediate danger of a Soviet attack.       (2) They should be strongly advised against the conclusion of an objectionable    commercial treaty with the Soviet.       (3) Sir R. Maconachie should  be authorised to repeat the  general assurance,    already given, of British interest in Afghan independence, and  to  add a very    cautious reference to the possibility that it might be of some benefit to Afghanistan    to join the League of Nations.       (4) He should  be further authorised  to  give, if necessary,  a guarded specific    assurance that in certain circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government would break    off official relations with the Soviet.       (5) If such  assurance is given, it should  be emphasised  that the  question    whether any further  action could be  taken, if the case arose,  would depend    entirely on  circumstances at the time.       (6) The whole of Sir R. Maconachie&apos;s communication would be governed by a    general caveat that  it holds good  only while relevant conditions remain materially    unaltered.    The draft of  a Despatch embodying these proposals is annexed.x*                                                                      J. S.3rd October 1932.                                                     S. H.-Appendix IV.
Telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul,                              dated 24th July 1931.    SO.  Your despatch No. 50 of 24th  April ;  attitude towards Soviet attack onAfghanistan.    2. I approve your attitude on receiving Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos; enquiry.    3. You should now state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom have carefully  considered  enquiry, and give oral  reply  to following effect:  You  mightbegin by remarking that Minister for Foreign Affairs will of  course understand  that policy of  His .\iajesty&apos;s  Government in  any contingency that  might arise, whether in connection with Afghanistan or elsewhere, must be guided by their  own  interests,as well as by the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other relevant international obligations.  These interests, as frequently stated, include themaintenance of a strong, independent and friendly Afghanistan.  Naturally, therefore,they could not regard with indifference unprovoked aggression  by a foreign power against a friendly Afghanistan.  But the exact  steps  to be taken in that event must depend upon the circumstances of the moment.    4. The above should  be the main substance  of your reply.  As regards theprovisions of the Covenant which are referred  to, the first paragraph  of Article 11would enable His Majesty&apos;s Government in the first instance to bring a case  of serious trouble between the Soviet Onion and Afghanistan  before  League Council.   council would then if necessary invite both parties, under Article 17, to accept obligations of league membership with a view to  the settlement  of the dispute.  If the AfghanGovernment accepted this invitation  and Soviet Government refused it and resorted towar in spite of  fact that both they and Afghan Government  are parties  to KelloggPact, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a position to  take  such action as theymight think appropriate in the circumstances.  The  procedure  under  the  Covenantstated above would of course be simplified if Afghanistan  herself were  a  Member ofthe League.    5. If Minister for  Foreign Affairs is not satisfied with statement in paragraph above and still presses for a special agreement j7ou may&apos;explain that it is contrary tothe policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to enter into military alliances.  If he shouldfurthermore refer to the case of Iraq, reply would be that provision for military aid inIraq treaty takes the place  of obligations already  existing  in  virtue of the  mandate.You should also remind him that a secret agreement or understanding  with anotherPower is not only incompatible with  declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, butalso with their obligations under Article IS of the Covenant.                                 APPENDIX II.     Note  of a  Conversation with the Afghan  Prime  and  Foreign  Ministers on                             the 29th March 1932.    After a few introductory remarks by the Prime Minister,  Faiz Muhammad Khansaid that the subject to which His  Highness wished to call  my attention was the stateof the relations existing between his  Government and the Soviet.    2. He had instructions to be entirely frank with me, and to answer any  questionsI might wish to  ask.  In  order  to give an adequate picture of the present  situation,he would have to go back to the time of Amanullah Khan  and mention a good manymatters which 1 knew already and possibly some which I did not.    3. In  the  time of Amanullah Khan,  the  policy  of  the  Soviet Government in afghanistan had certain  definite  objectives, of  which some or rather, to be fair toAmanullah, only a small proportion had been  achieved.   But this small  proportion,including an increase of  Russians  in Kabul, the  Termez-Kabul air service and,above all, the  certainty that Amanullah Khan himself was at heart hostile to Britishinterests,  had satisfied the Soviet as to their  prospects of complete success in thefuture.    4. Now for their attitude towards King Nadir Shah&apos;s Government.  When NadirShah was at Grasse in 1929 the Soviet had  dispatched an emissary to  him, inviting
Ghim to enter Afghanistan through Russia with the object of recovering the throne for-Amanullah Khan, and the latter had sent a message supporting this suggestion.    5. The decision of Nadir Shah to  travel by India  convinced the Soviet that hehad received an invitation similar to their own from His Majesty&apos;s Government andhad accepted  it.  Suspicion that he was already under British influence was thussown in their  minds, and subsequent  events nourished its  growth.  The grant  ofmoney and arms to Nadir Shah by the  Government of  India had been of the greatestmaterial assistance to Afghanistan, and the Afghan Government were deeply grateful for it.   At the same  time, the publicity given to this grant had caused  them the-gravest embarrassment, given a handle to very damaging propaganda against them,.and confirmed the suspicions of the Soviet.  The attitude of the Afghan Governmentin frontier matters, particularly towards the Afridis, had further strengthened thesesuspicions.  If he were speaking as a diplomat, Faiz Muhammad remarked, he mightpretend that this attitude  had been adopted simply out of  friendliness and gratitude to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and was really opposed  to Afghan interests.   But thiswas not the fact, and the  policy adopted by his  Government  of  friendly co-operation.with His Majesty&apos;s Government on,the Indian frontier had  been actuated by motivesof  self-interest, since they realised that Afghan  and British interests were identical,and that  by no other  means than an observance of  their treaty obligations couldhis Government gain the friendship of His Majesty&apos;s Government which was essentialto themselves.    5.  During  the last two-and-a-half  years  their Ambassador  at Moscow had donenothing at all, and M. Stark, althoiigh busy enough and constantly making demands upon the  Afghan Government, had made no real progress in any  direction.   TheSoviet were now profoundly dissatisfied with the attitude  of  King Nadir  Shah&apos;sGovernment.    7. In answer to a  question from me, Faiz Muhammad proceeded  to specify thedemands which he had mentioned  as being made  by M. Stark.  The most important of these demands, he said, was one which had never been  formulated.   It was for achange of heart on the  part of the Afghan Government,  to be shown by secret butreal hostility, like that of Amanullah Khan, to British interests.    The demands which M. Stark had explicitly made included one for the renewal ofthe Termez-Kabul air service, and for discussion of a  project for a through airmailservice to India.    Another demand was  for the conclusion of a Treaty of Commerce, to which theSoviet evidently attached  very great  importance.   All these  demands, as  I  had.already been informed, had so far  been evaded or rejected.   Then there were various other demands withoxit end, such as that for the increase of  cotton cultivation, with russian assistance, in Afghan Turkestan, combined  with an  undertaking  by theSoviet to purchase the whole crop ; a  demand for  a monopoly of the sale of oilproducts  in Afghanistan,  or, alternatively,  for  a  partnership between  the  two-Governments  for this  purpose ;  a demand for an additional Russian Consulate  inKataghan ; a demand for  a monopoly of the purchase of Afghan  &quot; Karakuli &quot; (Persianlamb)  and recently a sort of ultimatum about locusts.    9.  I said that I should like to hear more about the Treaty of Commerce.  His.Excellency had told me  of the Afghan offer to conclude a Treaty providing for  the-exchange of goods through official agencies and  I had understood  that negotiations were now being conducted on these lines.    10. Faiz Muhammad said that  this  was  so, but Afghanistan  was  not  in  fact.prepared to Bolshevise her institutions  to the extent which would be involved in suchan arrangement.  The Soviet further  demanded ex-territorial rights for their trade-officials and  premises, and this meant nothing less  than a network  of spies andpropagandists all over Afghanistan up to the Indian border.    .11. The Prime Minister  here  interjected  an  allusion to the Arcos raid, and the-similar incident in Germany.    12. I then  referred  to the  other argument which  Faiz Mithammad had told mehe had employed with M.  Stark, that so long as the Soviet  maintained the communistsystem they could not in fairness demand a trade convention of the kind concluded with countries organised on a different basis.   M. Stark&apos;s reply, Faiz Muhammad said,.
 had been to quote the instances of Turkey and Persia, and to state that his Government regarded the Afghan attitude in the matter as definitely unfriendly.    13.  Muhammad  Hashim remarked impatiently that we  were  wasting  time  in talking of &quot;fairness&quot;  in this connection, and begged me to remember that we  were not discussing the attitude of gentlemen.    14.  The Soviet, Faiz Muhammad coutinued,  also demanded the grant of  visas to Russian travellers as freely as to other foreigners.  Such visitors would of course  be political agents, and nothing else.    15.  In the face of these demands the Afghan Government had adopted an attitude which could not be said to have been lacking  in firmness.    As  regards  the Termez-Kabul  air service,  they  had now  notified  the Soviet Embassy that this service would be definitely closed as soon as the new  motor road by the Darra-i-Shikari  was completed.  The Soviet  Embassy could then send  their mails by motor transport like other foreign missions in Kabul.    The through air mail service the Afghan Government had refused to discuss, and had so far evaded the demand for a Treaty of Commerce.    They were on the point of  concluding  a Telegraph Convention  with  the Soviet, and in this had definitely put  an  end to  the arrangement, made  by the  Soviet with Amanullah Khan providing for the  exchange of official telegrams  by wireless without charge  between Afghanistan  and  Russia  in  return for the employment of  Russian operators in the  Kabul installation.   When M.  Stark had dangled before them the subsidy  promised  by  the Russo-Afghan  Treaty  of  1921,  they had  told him that although they were entitled to this subsidy without any conditions, they would in  no case accept it.    16.  But could  the  Afghan Government maintain  this  attitude  indefinitely, especially in view of the Soviets possible reactions to it ?  This is what they wished me to find out and tell them.  They were  well aware that the conclusion of  a Treaty of Commerce with the  Soviet would not only be dangerous for Afghanistan, but might also arouse British suspicions, and consequently lead  to  a deterioration  in  their relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government, which they were most anxious to avoid.    1 7.  But what were they to do if the Soviet applied pressure in order to gain  their immediate object, the conclusion of this Treaty ?  The danger was not imaginary,-and there was a  definite  precedent for such action on their  part.   The seizure of Urtatagai in 1926 had  been simply  a ruse  to secure the conclusion of the Agreement for the Termez-Kabul air service.   The Soviet had never wanted Urtatagai, but  were quite successful in attaining their real object,  the conclusion of the air  agreement.    In 1930, a Soviet force had violated the northern frontier and  penetrated Afghan territory  to a considerable distance.  The  effects  of  this incursion  had  been  so widespread that  King  Nadir  Shah had  almost lost  Afghan  Turkestan.   It was- conceivable that the Soviet might now, either secretly or openly, support  Amanullah Khan or Ghulam Nabi in an advance on Kabul from the north.    18.  The Afghan Government were  not able to appreciate either their own position or that of neighbouring Governments with  sufficient clearness to reach a decision as to their future attitude towards  the Soviet.    What was the political situation in Russia ?  Were the Soviet in a position to. attack Afghanistan ?   The Afghan  Government were constantly receiving reports of risings in Russian Turkestan.    Their  Consulate  at Tashkent, for instance, had just reported  a serious  rising in  Uzbekistan  and  the  despatch of  Russian troops  to Manchuria.  (Here Midiammad  Hashim showed me a report from Tashkent which  he asked me to read.)  There was, they knew, a rising  in Ferghana, and great misery. and discontent among most of the Moslem population of South Russia.   But what did it all mean ?  Was there any reasonable prospect of a general collapse of the Soviet in  the near future ?    19. If the Soviet  attacked  Afghanistan or Persia, what would be the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government or  the Government  of India or the League of  Nations? He had discussed this  subject, Faiz Muhammad said, with me before, but  my answers had not been  very definite, and  I had talked of  the League.  Since then the  League^had had an opportunity of demonstrating its capabilities in the Far East, but had not been able to do much  for China. In similar circumstances, could it, and would  it, do. any more for  Afghanistan ?
   20. To the Afghan Government  everything was dark, both the present and, stillmore so, the future.   They had no organised intelligence system, and their represen-tatives abroad were not trained or experienced observers.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere in  a very different position, and  to  them  things must be far clearer.   Theirrepresentatives were continually  engaged in international conferences at which  thepolitical  situation throughout the  world  came under review.  Their  intelligencesystem was well known to be highly organised and  efficient.   21. Faiz Muhammad concluded by begging  me very  earnestly to  represent  thepresent position of his Government, with all its uncertainty and consequent difficulties,.to the competent authorities in London, and to obtain considered and definite answers to the questions which  had been put to me.   These questions were vital and urgent,since on  the  answers given  to  them would depend  their own attitude, towards theSoviet in future, and the possibility of  maintaining their  present  relations, as thevsincerely desired to do, with His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.                                 APPENDIX III.          Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India,                            dated 10th September  1932.    1993.  Your telegram  of the 1st  instant,  2274,  and previous correspondence -regarding attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Soviet attack on Afghanistan.    2.  Our appreciation of the present position is as follows :        (a) Afghanistan.  We have  here a Government exceptionally friendly to His     Majesty&apos;s Government  and anxious  to preserve good relations with them  even at     some risk of  incurring Russian enmity, since  they realise  our friendship is  less-     likely to  endanger Afghan  independence and affords greater  security to  NadirV     dynastj7.   They are also  aware that their internal position is very unstable owing     to pro-Amanulla propaganda,  the assistance received  from  us  by Nadir in     securing&quot; throne and their consistent refusal  to  assist, our tribes in any conflict     with us.   This instability, coupled with the fear of Russian aggression  in  case     they turned a deaf ear to all Soviet requests, leads them to thiuk that they will be     forced to accede to Soviet  demands  against  their better judgment  unless they     can obtain from us some guarantee of effective support in an emergency.        (b) Russia.   Disappointed  at  loss  of  predominant  position   enjoyed in     Afghanistan  before ex-King  Amanulla&apos;s  flight and suspicions  that  Nadir&apos;s     inclinations are all towards side  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Soviet are     very anxious to recover  lost ground  by extracting  concessions and agreements-     from Afghanistan which will enable them to conduct a campaign of propaganda,.     parti cularljr in the neighbourhood of Indo-Afghan frontier.  One  phase of this     policy  is proposed   commercial  treaty  regarding  which   we  have  already     communicated our views in telegram  1873 of 26th August.  Similarly suggestion     for  reopening of Termez-Kabul  air route and frequent visits of  members of      Russian  Embassy to  Jalalabad are obviously intended to promote this policy.      The desire to reopen Termez-Kabul air route is in our opinion merely au excuse      on  the  part of Russia to establish a ground organisation within close touch  of      India which can at a few days&apos; notice  be  converted to war purposes and Avhich .      would involve on  our part increase to our air  forces.     3. Although  we have no  doubt  that  the  danger to India  of  this  policy   is  appreciated  by His Majesty&apos;s Government we feel it  our  duty  now to declare in the  strongest possible terms that wre regard the re-establishment of Russian influence in  Afghanistan  as a  most serious threat not only  to security of India and peace of the  frontier, but even to stability of the Empire.   So long  as we  can keep  a strong and  independent Afghanistan  between  ourselves  and  Russia, the  Empire  has  no land- -  frontier of importance on which we can be forced  into war by any foreign Power in  circumstances unfavourable to  ourselves.  If,  however, Russian  influence  becomes -  predominant in Afghanistan and Afghan independence  is threatened we should be  confronted before long with  a land frontier  some  500 miles in length  against a major  .European Power which would  involve us in military commitments and expense far  greater than any which we at present  contemplate.   It, therefore, seems  to us of vital  importance  to checkmate Russian infiltration at the earliest possible moment, and  it     * Note. In 1930-1 His Majesty&apos;s Government gave  Nadir  assistance in money and arms towards -  stabilising the  position which lie had won for himself in 1929.
would be  comparatively  easy  to  check Russian designs  now by supporting Nadir,whereas if they were once allowed to establish  a commercial foothold and  a groundorganisation for their air service it would be practically impossible to evict them.    4. Maconachie is, of course, best judge as to what degree of assurance will satisfyAfghans, and  we would strongly support his being given discretion to give  assuranceon  the  lines proposed in paragraph 6  of draft Memorandum.*  Although this may involve some risk of His Majesty&apos;s Government being expected to follow up breach of diplomatic  relations with some  more decisive action than might, be practicable in the  circumstances  of  the moment,  we consider this risk to  be  less formidablethan  clangers to which we should be  exposed  if Russia is allowed  to re-establishinfluence  in Afghanistan  and  to set up  near our  frontier bases for anti-british propaganda.    5. We  recommend, therefore,  that  the Minister  should be authorised to replygenerally  on the lines of the draft  Memorandum and  to emphasise  in  addition thefollowing  points :        (a)  His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire to encroach in any way upon the    independence of  Afghanistan,  and regard the existence  of  a strong and free    country between  themselves and  Russia as most necessary to  the security    of India.       (b) Policy now being pursued by Russia towards Afghanistan appears to them    intended  both  to encroach  on Afghan  independence  and  to aim at causing    disorder in Afghanistan,  on  the frontiers  of India and within  India itself, in    order  to embarrass  His Majesty&apos;s  Government and  to  prejudice Anglo-Afghan    relations.  It  is,  therefore, in  the interests  both of  Afghanistan and  of the    British Government to resist this policy by all possible means.       (c)  That while not anticipating anything in the shape of an invasion by force,    we should, in such  an eventuality, be bound as a member of  the  League of    Nations to appeal to the League, and consider that League action will be greatly    retarded and  prejudiced  unless Afghanistan herself becomes  a member.  We    would  therefore suggest  that she should  be urged to join  the  League at the    earliest possible moment.    6. We have stated at ove that we regard this  whole question as of vital importance,not only  to India, but also to Empire, and  we invite particular attention  of HisMajesty&apos;s   Government to  recommendations  recorded  by  Committee  of  ImperialDefence on Report of Defence of India Committee,  1927, which was exceptionallystrong both in  statesmanship  and expert knowledge.  We appreciate that these recommendations are  now five years  old  and  our position has  altered  since thattime  by reason  of  our being signatories of Kellogg Pact  and of Covenant of theLeague of Nations.   They cannot, therefore, be reaffirmed in their entirety withouta re-examination of their implications, especially on military side.  But we cannot seethat there has been any  fundamental  change vis-d-vis Russia which could call for revision of policy which lias been  consistently  followed by  successive Governmentssince  1903. And  it appears to us that we now have opportunity of furthering that policy of assisting Afghanistan against Russia in that Amanulla&apos;s disappearance hasresulted in substitution of a Government which is certainly more friendly to ourselves and, we may hope, more stable.  Consequently, we can afford to be more liberal than under last regime in our  promises of support, provided that we are satisfied of our ability to implement them.    The Defence of India Sub-Committee of 1927 recommended and Cabinet approvedcertain practical measures with object  of drawing  the  two countries closer together and of  proving  to Afghan Government that  in certain contingencies we  would  beprepared to support them.   Some of these proposals became  obsolete when Amanulladisappeared, but none of them have been implemented.  We  suggest that such of the1927  proposals as are still relevant, together with any other practical measures whichMaconachie may be able to suggest,  should be re-examined with a  view to immediate action being taken so as to give Nadir an earnest of our intentions.    Finally, we think that it might be of advantage that a  public  declaration shouldbe made on the lines of formula set out in paragraph 71 of First Report of Defence ofIndia Sub-Committee, C.I.D. paper 158 D.  We realise that this might do Nadir harmwith his own subjects, but consider that Minister should be given discretion to discuss with Nadir the question whether such an announcement would strengthen his position.   * Note. The reference  is to a draft Memorandum sent to the Government  of India in consulting-them on the question, paragraph 6 of which corresponded with paragraph S of the draft despatch inAppendix IV.      1230                                                                B
                                   APPENDIX IV.                       Draft Despatch to Sir R. Maconachie,  Kabul.       1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration your Despatch No. 48, of   31st March 1932, and the enclosed note of an interview on 29th March with the Afghan   Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister in which they asked for information firstly as   to the situation in the U.S.S.R.,  and  secondly  as  to  the  attitude  of  His Majesty&apos;s   Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India and of  the League I  of Nations if  the Soviet should attack Afghanistan.  As  regards  conditions in the I  U.S.S. R., I enclose a memorandum which has been prepared  in the Foreign Office on   this subject for your use in giving information orally to the Afghan Government.  As   regards their second enquiry, the question of the reply  to be given has  been carefully   considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I am now able to give you the following   instructions as to the oral reply which you should return.       2. At the outset of your reply  you should emjjhasise  that the Soviet Government   must be well  aware of the very special interest which His Majesty&apos;s Government and   the Government of India take in this question, and  that  they would consequently be   very chary of taking action which would  lead to British intervention.  As has been   explained  in the memorandum on  conditions  in Russia, our information is all  to  the   effect that the  Soviet  Government are at present anxious to  avoid  any possibility of   becoming  involved in a serious  dispute  with any  foreign country; and that they   would be especially reluctant  to expose  themselves to the  double risk of both arousing   Mohammedan opinion against them and losing the British  market for their exports.   The continued existence of the British market in particular is vital to the  success of   the five-year plan.  That plan is  at present at a critical  stage and  its abandonment   would be a catastrophe for the Soviet Government.      3. You may indeed inform the Afghan Government that, in the considered opinion   of His Majesty&apos;s Government, there is  no immediate danger  of the Soviet attacking   Afghanistan or applying forcible pressure in  order  to  obtain a commercial treaty or   compliance with  any of their other recent demands.  There is, therefore, no reason   why the Afghan Government should hesitate  to  reject  proposals for a commercial   treaty of a kind which they consider dangerous to their  interests.      4. In this  connection, His Majesty&apos;s  Government and the  Government of India   have carefully examined the probable  effects not only  on Afghan but  on  British   interests of a Soviet-Afghan commercial treaty of  the kind  apparently desired by the   Soviet.  I  enclose for your information and guidance  a memorandum prepared  in the   Foreign Office  on this subject, together with copy of a telegram from the Government   of India, No. 1873, of 26th August 1932.  His Majesty&apos;s Government concur generally   in the views expressed in that telegram and approve the recommendations in its third   paragraph.  It is understood that the negotiations for the treaty have recently broken   down, but  it cannot  be assumed that the project will not  be revived  by the Soviet   Government.   You should  accordingly take any opportunity  (either in the course of   your reply to the enquiries of 29th March or at some other time) to advise the Afghan   Government of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government  on this question in the sense   of the enclosed memorandum and  of  the Government  of India&apos;s  telegram.  The   Afghan Government  should be  advised  that a trade  agency at Kabul  should  be   allowed only in the last resort.      5. In your reply to the specific enquiries as to the attitude of  His  Majesty&apos;s&apos;   -Government if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan,  you should  make  it clear that the   replies which  His Majesty&apos;s Government are in a position  to make to the enquiries   addressed  to them by the Afghan  Government are not to be regarded as necessarily   holding good for all time and in all circumstances.  These  replies hold good  only in   existing conditions, or so long as conditions so far as this country, Afghanistan  and   Russia are concerned remain materially  the  same  as at  present.   Subject to this   general, caveat, the Afghan Government  might  be  informed that if  the relationsl   between them  and the Soviet should  become  so   strained  that  the  integrity of   Afghanistan appeared to be seriously menaced, a  request from the  Afghan Govern- ,  ment for diplomatic assistance would  receive careful and sympathetic consideration&apos;&quot;  by  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.   And  if  the Soviet attacked  Afghanistan, this   would, be regarded by His  Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  and the   Government of India as an attack on British  and Indian interests, and would force   them  to take  the  steps normally  taken by the  Government of a  State  when  its
11c interests  are  seriously  threatened.  The  immediate step to be taken would  clearly- be diplomatic intervention, which might  be followed if necessary by pressure in the: sphere of economic relations.    6:- It might be added that His Majesty&apos;s Government will always regard themselves as the Power  primarily interested in  the  maintenance  of  her independence&apos;  by Afghanistan, but that it might be to the advantage of  the Afghan Government,  in enlisting  the sympathy  and possibly  the material support of other Powers in the same cause, or  action by at any rate some of them in the same sense  as that to be taken  by His Majesty&apos;s Government, if  she were a member of the League of Nations at the time of the Soviet aggression  postulated  above ;  and while  you should make it clear that the Afghan Government must form  their own conclusions on the ability of the League to render them  effective  assistance, you should leave them in no  doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to favour their entry into the League and consider that their position woidd thereby be  strengthened.    7. His Majesty&apos;s  Government recognise  that it is improbable that the Afghan Government wall  be satisfied with  the vague general statements suggested in the preceding paragraphs, as an answer  on somewhat similar lines has already been given (on 30th July of last year) to their previous enquirj&apos;- as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the  event  of war between  Russia and Afghanistan.  The Afghan Government in making their  present enquiry remarked  that the previous reply had not been  very definite.   They have  accordingly now again  asked what would  be the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan; and for the purpose  of deciding to  what extent they  would  be justified  in resisting Soviet demands  detrimental to their own and our interests, they appear to be anxious to know on what  measure of support  they  covdd  definitely count from His Majesty&apos;s Government if the Soviet took military action.    8. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore most carefully  examined the question of giving the Afghan Government a  more specific assurance of the action  which they would be prepared  to  take in certain  circumstances, and  have decided  that if the Afghan Government are not satisfied with anything less you should have discretion to give them an assurance in the following  terms.   If  Russia invaded Afghan territorj7por-.the-purpose-of permanent occupation or to provoke  a Russo-Afghan.war, and provided that such Russian action were clearly unprovoked  by any action  on the part of the Afghan Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government  would be  prepared, if their previous  diplomatic intervention had  failed, to break off diplomatic and  official commercial relations with the Soviet Governmm^  But in order to avoid  present or future misunderstanding, this intimation should be coupled with a plain statement that  this  is the furthest length to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to go towards defining their  attitude in advance, and that the question whether  any further action could be  taken, if and  when the case  arose, would  depend  entirely upon- circumstances at the time.    9. In this connection His Majesty&apos;s  Government have noted that the  Defence  of India Committee of 1927, whose report  was approved by the  Cabinet  of  that time, assumed  (paragraph 41 of their report) that Russian action of  the kind in question would in  fact in the last resort be followed by  a declaration of war  against that Power. But that  report is now five  years old, and it may be  that  the questions  dealt with therein are in need of re-examination by  the Committee of Imperial Defence.  There has been  no prospect, however, of undertaking such re-examination in  time to admit of its results being available for  consideration in connection with the decision of the reply to be  given  to the Afghan Governments present enquiry.  And as the need for such a decision is immediate,  it has  been decided that your reply may, if necessary, include, but should not go beyond, the specific assurance contained in paragraph 8  of this  despatch.  Should the Afghan Government enquire whether our severance  of diplomatic relations, if  it failed to deter  Russia, would not be likely to lead on to a state of war, you should reply  by  again making it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government-are unable to add  anything  to  the  statement  already made  (viz. the statement  in. paragraph 8 of this despatch).
