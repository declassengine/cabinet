THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for ike Cabinet.   July 1932.SECRET.CP.  270 (32).CABINET.                    DISARMAMENT  CONFERENCE    1.  THE Resolution adopted by the General Commission on the 22nd July,-at the end of the first stage of the Disarmament Conference, is annexed.  TheResolution was proposed by Dr. Benes as rapporteur;  its framework was largely due to a series of private  consultations between the British, American. Frenchand Italian Delegations.  Dr. Benes, in the meantime, collected views from thesmaller States, and we did our best to keep in touch with the German Delegation.The  last-named was  really only indirectly concerned, since the  terms of theResolution were all in favour of the reduction of armaments along lines whichwould promote greater equality with the German position.  But, on the final dayof the discussions,  Herr Nadolny announced that  he had  instructions  to vote against the  Resolution, and nothing  would  shake him  from  this attitude.Obviously, it was largely to be explained by Germany&apos;s domestic politics and bythe approaching German elections.  The declaration  with which Herr  Nadblnjrconcluded his speech is of very considerable importance as indicating Germany&apos;sresolve to  bring to the front  her  claim  for &quot;equality of treatment,&quot; and this declaration is also appended to the present memorandum.  Germany&apos;s intentionto raise this issue through diplomatic channels in the very near future has, withinthe last few days, been plainly conveyed by Count Bernstorff when communicatingGermany&apos;s adherence to the Anglo-French Declaration.    The other Great Power  which suddenly adopted a line  of  protest aboutthe Resolution was Italy, notwithstanding that the Italian Delegation had closelyco-operated with the framing of the Resolution and had agreed to its terms pointby point.   In the public debate the Italian spokesman declared that Italy was entirely dissatisfied with the progress made and with the contents of the document and&apos; would abstain.    2.  The attitude of the  United States Delegation may be summarised asfollows :   Mr. Gibson and  his colleagues had obtained a  good deal of  support,especially from the smaller States, for  the Hoover plan,  which was  announced on the 22nd June.  Indeed, there is no doubt that a direct vote  at Geneva on theplan  would have  resulted in a large majority declaring for its acceptance as awhole.  The  British declaration on the  subject was not warmly received in any quarter.   The Japanese silently approved; the French attitude was not clearlydisclosed, and they were very willing to  leave us to take the brunt of criticism.There was a good deal  of  depreciation of the British attitude going  on behind the scenes, in which American journalists and our own  Left wing newspaperstook a leading part.    When, therefore, the United Kingdom Delegation returned to Geneva afterthe Cabinet of the 12th July,  and private discussions about  the Resolution were resumed, the situation, from the point of view of Anglo-American relations, wasnot easy.  But it steadily improved, and, before the Resolution was proposed and passed, cordiality was complete.  The American Delegates expressed  themselvesto us  as heartily grateful, and I have reason to know- that they conveyed the sameimpression to others.    3.  In passing judgment on the Resolution, this aspect of the matter mustbe remembered and allowed for.   The  alternative to Anglo-French-Americanaccord in getting the Resolution passed would have been either no Resolution       6488  [7383]Copy  No.     49
at all or a Resolution in terms which would have put the United States on one side and ourselves on the other.   As-things turned out,&apos; the three parties  stoodloyally by one another throughout the discussions, and, though the result may notbe in other respects entirely satisfactory, the dangers of  misunderstanding and mutual  reproach have at any rate been avoided.     4.  The Cabinet must now decide what action it is necessary to take in  orderto put the United Kingdom Delegation in a position, when the Bureau meets inSeptember and the General  Commission  resumes later on, to make its definitecontribution on the lines of the Resolution.  It is suggested that the Departmentsconcerned should be instructed to examine the proposals in the Resolution withwhich they are concerned, and put forward constructive suggestions as to how these proposals may be implemented.   These suggestions should Be available not later than the 5th September.  These proposals might then be considered as awhole by the Cabinet Disarmament Sub-Committee, who would report upon themto the  Cabinet.  The object must be to have a more  definite  policy for our delegation when the discussions at the Bureau are reopened. v.    5.  As regards specific paragraphs in the Resolution, it is useful to note thatthe proposition that &quot; air attack against the civilian population shall be absolutelyprohibited &quot;  is  a   proposition  approved   by  the  Air  Ministry see, forexample, paragraph 7 of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air in cp. 181  (32).     The  other   paragraph   dealing with  bombardment  from  the  air   is subject   to  two  limitations.   First,   it   is  expressed  as   being  subjectto  agreement  with  regard  to measures  to  be  adopted  for the  purposeof  rendering  the   observance  of   the   rule  effective,   and  it  remains  toarrive at  an adequate agreement  for this purpose.  Secondly,  the  propositionis in the form :  &apos;&apos; The High. Contracting Parties shall agree as between them-selves,  &amp;c.....,&quot;  and this form  was deliberately adopted in order not toinclude  police action in wild areas not undertaken against another contracting party.  Though this was mentioned in the private discussions, it was not referredto in the debate, and, indeed, the representative of the Government of Indiaexpressly  asked that the point should not  be stressed.     6.  As regards naval armaments, the Resolution contains an invitation bythe Conference to the great  naval Powers &quot; to confer together and to report tothe General Commission, if possible before the resumption of its work, as to thefurther measures of  naval reduction which might be feasible as  a part of thegeneral  programme of disarmament.&quot;   It appeared to the United kingdom delegation at Geneva, in consultation with the Admiralty representatives, thata paragraph in this form was the best way to avoid an  immediate challenge onthe naval proposals of President Hoover.  It will be necessary for the Britishcase to  be prepared without delay, and, presumably, the views of Japan, Franceand Italy on the British proposals and their intentions as regards the american proposals must be confidentially ascertained.     There are a number of other  matters in the Resolution which will requirecontributions  from  other Departments before the Cabinet can finally decide on supplementary instructions  to the United Kingdom Delegation for the resumedConference.     7.  The Cabinet  should regard the Disarmament Resolution of the 22nd Julynot  as  an achievement  in  disarmament, but as a  temporising  measure.  Itsjustification is that the alternative  to such a Resolution  was a conflict at theConference in which we should have found ourselves not only in the minority, butin a minority against America.  The political and international gain of avoidingthis situation is obvious.  But the gain will not continue indefinitely if nothing more is  done.  While we have gained a breathing-space, we are left  face to facewith,the stark situation that at the end of the year we must either go some way towards implementing American expectations, or  take  the consequences ofdefinitely  rejecting  them and of putting forward nothing which will be regardedas adequate in their place.

ANNEX I.   RESOLUTION ADOPTED  BY THE GENERAL COMMISSION OF  THE DISARMAMENT                       CONFERENCE ON JULY 23, 1932.                                     I.     The Conference for.the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments,     Profoundly convinced  that the time has come when all nations of the worldmust adopt substantial and comprehensive measures of disarmament in order to consolidate the peace of the world, to hasten the resumption of economic activity,and to lighten the  financial burdens which  now  weigh  upon the peoples of  theworld:     Desirous of avoiding a competition in the power of armaments which wouldbe both ruinous to the peoples and threatening to their national defence;     Recalling its resolutions of the  19th, 20th  and 22nd April, 1932;     Firmly determined to achieve  a first decisive step involving a substantial reduction of armaments, on the basis of article  8 of the Covenant of the League ofNations,  and  as a  natural consequence of the obligations resulting  from  theBriand-Kellogg Pact;     Welcoming heartily the  initiative taken by  the President, of the UnitedStates of xAmerica in formulating concrete proposals for a substantial reductionof armaments by the prohibition of certain methods of warfare, by the abolition ofcertain material,  and  by  reductions varying  in magnitude and amountingfor certain armaments to the proportion of one-third;     Bearing in mind also the draft convention of the Preparatory Commission,the statements &quot;and proposals made to the Conference by a number of delegations,and the reports and resolutions of the various commissions of the Conference :     Decides  forthwith  and  unanimously,  guided  by  the  general principlesxmderlying President Hoover&apos;s declaration :     1.

That a primary objective shall be to reduce the means of attack.        II. CONCLUSIONS  OF THE  FIRST  PHASE OF  THE CONFERENCE.     The Conference, noting  that agreement has  now7 been reached on a  certainnumber of important  points, decides, without prejudice to more far-reachingagreements  hereafter, to record  forthwith the following concrete measures of disarmament,  which should form  part of the general convention to be concluded.The Conference also decides to establish certain principles as the basis for  further reductions of armaments, and to determine the procedure necessary for the activeprosecution of its work.                               1.  Air Forces.     The Conference, deeply impressed with the danger overhanging civilisationfrom bombardment  from the air in the event of future conflict, and determined totake all practicable measures  to provide against this danger,  records at this stage of its work the following conclusions :       1. Air attack against  the civilian population shall be absolutely prohibited;     2. The  high contracting parties shall agree  as between themselves that all          bombardment from  the  air shall be abolished, subject to agreement          with regard to  measures to be adopted for the purpose of  rendering          effective the observance of this rule.                 These measures should  include the following :            (a) There shall  be effected a limitation by number and a restriction by                 characteristics of military aircraft;                   ;       [7383]                                                      B 2
AA(b) Civil aircraft shall be submitted to regulation and full publicity.      Further,  civil  aircraft  not  conforming  to  the  specified      limitations  shall  be  subjected  to  an  international  regime      (except for cerl,ajn.jfigions where such a regime is not suitable)      &quot;such-as-to prevent effectively the misuse of such civil aircraft.                            2.  Land  Armaments.(a)  Land Artillery.    1. All heavy land artillery of calibres  between any maximum limit  as determined in the succeeding paragraph and a lower limit to be defined  shall belimited in number.    2. The limitation of calibre of land artillery shall be fixed by the convention.    Subject  to  an  effective method  being established  to  prevent  the  rapidtransformation of guns on fixed mountings into mobile  guns,  different  maximafor the calibre of land guns may be fixed as follows   -    (a) A maximum limit for the calibre of coastal guns, which shall not be less          than  the maximum calibre of naval guns;&apos;: -  (b) A maximum limit  for  the calibre of  guns in  permanent frontier or;  .        fortress defensive systems:    (c) A maximum limit for the calibre of mobile land guns (other than guns          employed for coastal defence).ih)  Tanks.    The maximum unit tonnage of tanks shall be limited.            3. Chemical, Bacteriological and Incendiary Warfare.

There shall  be set  up  a. Permanent Disarmament Commission with  theconstitution,  rights and duties  generally as outlined in Part VI of the draft-convention submitted  by the Preparatory  Commission for the DisarmamentConference, with such extension of its powers as may be deemed by the Conferencenecessary to enable the convention to be effectively applied.      III. PREPARATION  OF THE  SECOND  PHASE  OF  THE  CONFERENCE.    The Conference requests the Bureau to continue its work during the periodof adjournment of the General Commission, with a view to framing with the collaboration (if necessary) of a Drafting Committee, draft texts concerning thequestions on which agreement  has already  been reached:   Such texts will becommunicated to all delegations as soon as  they are drafted, and will then besubmitted to the commission.    Points which call for detailed examination will be examined by  the Bureauor  by the appropriate  committees,  with the assistance of the  Governmentsconcerned, in order that definite conclusions may be reached as soon as the GeneralCommission meets again.    The  questions which  will  form the subject of such examination are thefollowing :                                 1. Effectives.    A strict limitation and a real reduction of effectives shall be brought about.    For this purpose, the Conference invites  the Bureau to examine, with the collaboration  of  such delegations  as it considers  necessary, the  proposal  of president Hoover relating  to  effectives.   These  studies  should   take  intoconsideration, in the case of each country, the actual conditions of defence andthe number and character of its  forces.r
               2. Limitation of. National. L)e.fence\ Expenditure.     (a) The Conference shall decide on the resumption of its labours, taking intoaccount the special  conditions of&apos;  each  State, what  system of limitation and publicity of expenditure on national  defence  will provide the  peoples with thebest guarantee of an alleviation of  their financial burdens, and will prevent themeasures of  qualitative and  quantitative disarmament to be inserted in  theConvention from being neutralised by increases or improvements  in authorisedarmaments.              ;                                 ....     (b) With a view to the decisions to be taken under this head, the Conferencerequests the  Committee on  National Defence  Expenditure and  its  technical committee to continue and complete  the work entrusted to its organs and to submit their report as soon as possible.  The Conference requests its Bureau to draw up,-on the basis of this report, a plan accomplishing the purpose aimed  at and taking into consideration the special conditions of the various States.                    3.  Trade in and Manufacture of Arms.     The Bureau will set  up a special  committee to submit  proposals to theConference,  immediately on  the   resumption  of its work, in regard to  theregulations to be applied to the trade in and  private and State manufacture ofarms and implements of war.                            4. Naval Armaments.     As regards  the proposals  made by  President Hoover and  other relatedproposals concerning naval armaments, the Conference invites the Powers partiesto the naval  treaties of Washington  and London, which have already producedimportant results, to confer together and to report to the General Commission, ifpossible before the  resumption of its work, as to  the further measures of navalreduction which might be feasible  as  a part  of the general programme of disarmament.     The Conference further  invites  the naval  Powers other  than the Powersparties to the  above treaties to make arrangements for determining the degree-of naval limitation they are prepared to accept in view of the Washington and london Treaties and the general  programme of disarmament  envisaged in thepresent resolution.     The Bureau will be kept informed of the progress of these negotiations,which it will be its duty to co-ordinate within  the  framework of  the general convention  in  preparation  for the  comprehensive  decisions of the GeneralCommission. .;                              5. Violations.     Rules of  international  law  shall  be formulated  in  connexion  with theprovisions relating to  the prohibition of the use of chemical, bacteriological and incendiary weapons and bombing  from the air, and shall be  supplemented by special measures dealing with infringement of these provisions.                6.  Future Work of the Conference: Procedure.     Pending the resumption of the meetings of the General Commission,  the bureau will keep the delegations informed  of the progress of the work.     It will be for the Bureau to fix the  date of the next meeting of the General Commission  with one month&apos;s notice.  The meeting of the General Commission shall take place not later than four months after the resumption of the work ofthe Bureau, which will meet during the week beginning the 19th September, 1932                         IV. GENERAL PROVISIONS.     The present resolution in no way prejudges  the attitude of the Conference towards any  more comprehensive measures of  disarmament or  towards  the political proposals submitted by various delegations.
                          V. ARMAMENTS TRUCE.    In  order  to ensure that, pending the resumption of  the meetings of theGeneral Commission and during the second phase of its work, no steps shall heinitiated by any Power which might prejudice the preparation  of the general disarment  Convention, the Conference decides to recommend  to the Govern-ments to renew for a period of four months from the 1st November, 1932, the truceprovided for by the resolution of the Assembly of the League of Nations.of the29th September, 1931.ANNEX  II.DECLARATION MADE IN THE NAME OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT BY HERR NADOLNY    AT  GENEVA ON  JULY  22,.. 1932,  TO  THE  GENERAL  COMMISSION   OF  THE    DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.    The German Government is ready to continue its collaboration in the workof the Disarmament  Conference in order to contribute with all its power to theefforts made with  a view  to effecting  a  really decisive step towards  general disarment in the sense of Article 8 of  the  Covenant!   Its  collaboration,however, is not possible unless the future  work of the Conference continues onthe basis of a clear  and unequivocal recognition of equality of  right betweenthe nations.    Equality of right is the fundamental principle on which the  League ofNations and the community of States in general rest. If the Conference were to wish  to establish the rules and principles of the general disarmament of theStates while excluding at the same time Germany or other States from those rules and principles and submitting any given State to an exceptional discriminatoryregime,  such an attitude would not  be  compatible with sentiments  of  nationalhonour  and  with  international  justice.   It would also be contrary to thecontractual rights  which belong to Germany and which she  could not possiblyrenounce. To its profound regret the  German Government  must remark  thatthe present Resolution takes no account of this point of view. The work of thefirst phase of the Conference, and notably the  conversations of the  concludingdays,  have, on the  contrary, given the German Government the impression  thatthis necessary condition has not yet been understood or admitted  by all theGovernments.   The German  Government  considers  that   this  uncertaintyregarding one of  the fundamental  questions of  the problem  of disarmament.renders all useful  work  impossible.   It must in  consequence insist that these doubts should be eliminated by a recognition without further delay of the equality of all  States in so far as national security and the application of all the provisionsof the Convention are concerned.  In so much  as the different questions whichresult from the application of the principle of equality of right demand clarifica-tion, the German Government is ready to enter immediately into negotiations withthe States interested. The German Government must, however, at the same  time-state, here and now, that it cannot undertake to  continue its collaboration  if asatisfactory solution of  this  point, decisive for Germany,  has not been  reachedwhen the work of the Conference is resumed.o
