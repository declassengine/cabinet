1 AOPARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the High&apos; Commissioner inCanada for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.Dated 2na August, 1932.Part II received Dominions Office, 3o30 a.,.3rd August, 1932.MOST IMMEDIATE.No. 24S (Part I).             Part I has not yet been received inthe Dominions Office, hut will he circulated as soonas possible./&quot;&quot;Dominions Office Note.     This part of telegrampresumably deals with the negotiations between theDominions (including Southern Rhodesia) and theUnited Kingdom as regards the concessions which each government may be willing to give.7
Dominions Office Notes  As regards this part of the telegram,  the United Kingdom delegation have asked that the  references to India should on no account be repeated  to the Government of India as they regard it as essential  that that Government should receive its first intimation  from Sir Atul Chatter;]ee who will explain the position  more fully than is done in this telegram.   (part II)o  India..   India has taken no part in InterDominion discussions referred to.   Stage has been reached in negotiations with India at which Indian delegationare about tc submit to the Government of India proposalsfor an agreement under which United Kingdom would receive from India preference of 10 per cent (motors 7-g- per cent)ever a wide range of revenue duties covering a trade whichin 1929-30 amounted to over  (sterling) 40 millions ofwhich more than half was held by foreign countries,          India is not in a position to give immediateundertakings as regards protective duties except probably in regard to galvanised sheets.  Consideration by tariff board of cotton piece goods  should however result in increased preferences.  The  India delegation  take theview that any  proposal to accord preferences  on  goodsnormally free  of  duty including machinery would  imperilchances  of  arrangement being accepted by  legislature.As a whole  these  proposals  amount to  an offer of which is both very  substantial in  character and as much asIndian  Legislature  could reasonably be expected  to concede  especially  as Imperial  preference as  such isa novelty  to India.   In return  it is  proposed that weshould  concede maintenance  of existing preferencesgenerally  together  with increased preferenceson coffee  rice vegetable  oils and Magnesium  Chloride-and  removal from  free list  of Linseed of which Indiaclaims  that supplies  can  rapidly be  increased.&quot;&quot;
          Russia.          Detailed discussions have not taken place with Canadians who have raised the question of Russiandumping but United Kingdom Delegation have  been considering whether it would be possible that dumpingsuch as that from Russia could be dealt with by some general legislative provision in cases where it can  be shownthat preferential arrangements agreed to are being frustratedby such dumping.   They have however not yet devised any satisfactory scheme and matter is still under consideration.          Customsi Administrationv          A Sub-Committee of Trade Promotion Committeehas reported that it would be impracticable to survey thewhole field with a view to uniformity.   The Sub-Committeehas however accepted certain general principles notablythat the greatest practical measure of certainty shouldbe given to exporters as to duties applicable to their goods.Specific matters referred to in Committee by variousDelegations are being considered in the light of those principles,   Our principal concern is with Canada andour difficulties in regard to valuation for customs  dutypurposes have been discussed but little progress has beenmade and it seems probable that only by bilateral discussioncan removal of our difficulties be obtained if at all.   ;          Preference regulations.          Sub-Committee of Trade Promotion Committeehas considered report of Imperial Economic  Committee on&quot;definition of  Empire goods&quot; and is drafting itsreport.   Sub-Committee will probably recommend fullenquiry after Conference in consultation with producers
and users (vide paragraph 29&quot;  I.E.C.   Report).     Commercial relations with Foreign Countries.           .....   . .    . .    ......  . .  ...          There has been no meeting as yet of theCommittee formed to deal with this subject.Monetary side of Conference.          The Chancellor&apos;s speech produced good impression,                                           xxSummary of this has been cabled to Treasury .    Speeches&quot;by other delegates contained nothing unexpected butthere was a consensus of opinion that unless wholesalecommodity prices rose primary producers in all theDominions v/ould be faced with disaster and might even be un-able to meet their obligations to us.   Little or nothinghas been heard of Empire Super Bank Empire Currency orSilver and it is gratifying that crude inflationary pro-posals have not been put forward.     x Dominions Office note .  This paragraph which appears in the Twenty-Fifth Report of the ImperialEconomic Committee runs as follows:-       We have not examined representatives of Indus-tries in detail but we have general.grounds for believing that a move towards 50 per cent.,  with exceptions above and possibly below, allowing for the cases of materialwe have mentioned, would be practicable and not unreason-able .       We recommend therefore - on the assumption thatit is agreed to aim  it a normal requirement of 50 per cent for Empire content - that there should be an enquiry toascertain the steps that would have to be taken by wayof exception or modification of conditions as to exclude   )materials, etc., so that when the  decision is reached toput the 50 per cent, standard in operation, the conditionswill have been settled which are necessary to enablethat standard to work smoothly.,    xx&quot;Dominions Office note.   This summary was circu-lated to the Cabinet on 2nd August as telegram No. D.O.345(32)  in Dominions Office Print,
          In private discussions issues have &quot;been considerably narrowed but India, Australia, NewZealand and Canada in that order persist in asking for some indication that present policy of cheap and abundantmoney will be continued with a view to raising sterlingprices even if gold prices remain down.   Canada isspecially anxious that we should keep in step  with united States of America relation.Economic co-operation.        -  Sub-committees on industrial standardisationand on procedure have been set up by the Committeeon this subject which proposes to discuss industrialco-operation.   On general question of economic co-operation the United Kingdom Delegation are of theopinion that serious discussion should be postponed until some considerable progress has been made ontariff question.   Indications tend to show that Unionof South Africa is more favourable than hitherto toidea of arrangements for economic co-operation betweenConferences and is anxious for continuance of  workof Empire Marketing Board.   Canada however remainssuspicious.
          Cpiumereial relatiohs between Colonies and dominions and India.,   The request of the Coloniesfor new or increased preferences in Dominions and india have &quot;been discussed with delegates or officials ofIndia and of all Dominions except Union and Irish FreeState.   Although no definite agreements have been reached,general indications are that majority of requests willbe grantedj  Australia however is showing seriousreluctance to grant preferences on commodities inwhich Dutch East Indies competes with Colonial Empire.Dominions seem satisfied generally with their tarifftreatment in the Colonial Empire and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies anticipates no great difficultyin procuring useful adjustments in tariffs of theDominions and of India.   ^here is no indication atpresent that preferences will be refused to areasaffected by Congo-Basin Treaties and Anglo-FrenchConvention on ground of non-reciprocity, but attitudeof Dominions and India in regard to these Treatieshas not yet crystallised.

PARAPHRASE telegram from the High Commissioner in Canadafor His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom totho Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(Dated 3rd August 1932.   Received, Dominions Office,              7.15 p.m.   3rd August 1932).Immediate.No. 242. Secret.         Part 1 of appreciation of present position.Concession! s)_by^JDomijii^qns.        We have now closely examined Australian proposals.Some increases of preferences against foreign goods  areincluded but the proposals do not go far enough toenable United Kingdom goods to compete with local industry.Thus benefits to our trade can be secured only at theexpense of foreign imports through operation of increasedduties on foreign goods.   Trade diverted by change  onthese lines would not amount to any very considerablevolume for many years and we propose to press australia to improve on these offers substantially.         It is difficult to expect more from Hew Zeal.andin return for existing position as this Dominion hastreated us so well in  the past.   They might make changes which would be generous in intention in return forfurther concessions from us but we hold so much of  tradedalready that it is doubtful if  trade actually divertedcould reach important  figure.   Something more may  perhaps be forthcoming but   the results in increased trade  in thenature  of  the case cannot be considerable.sontliMAfxioa.jind . Cjuj&amp;deu,   Apart from original suggestions made by South African  official^)  before leaving Londonno offers  yet received.   As regards Canada we have  as yet received no proposals:  we understand however that             !          &apos; 1.
-i fr-Qanadian Government have during the last few daysbeen working hard on offers which are expected this we ek.          Newfoundland  now gives no preference.Seme preference appears possible but position dominated by revenue difficulties.          Southern Rhodesia has granted some increasedpreference in the last budget and further preferencesmight be given for concessions (mainly tobacco),2.        Requests by Dominions.          It v/as arranged as regards preferential treatment of imports from Dominions that Dominionsconcerned with each group of products should consult together in order to ascertain whether common agreement could be reached as regards proposals on butter andother dairy products cereals fruit meat metals andminerals.   Other commodities including timber winetobacco and sugar are to be dealt with subsequently.Position of Irish Free State in these discussions is described in my telegram of July 27th No.214.(Dominions Office Note.  Telegram No.214 ran as follows:-           Delegation of the Irish Free State are taking part in inter-Dominion discussions about particular commodities.:   They are not however joining in with theother Dominions in actual presentation of results ofthese discussions to United Kingdom delegation on theground that no useful purpose would be served and otherDominions concerned might be embarrassed if the FreeState were to do so.   They are clearly anxious not tomake things&apos; awkward for other delegations with happyresult that they cannot make things av/kward for us.).
1 Kfi      Prom evidence before us we judge  that  meat and butter  are  the commodities  to which the greatest importance  is attached and small import duties plus quantitative restriction  of  foreign supplies are form which the proposals  are likely  to take.   As they are received the proposals are submitted for classification and elucidation to a Co-ordinating Committee of officials on  v/hich all concerned are represented (including our- selves but  excluding Irish Free State).      Discussicns on  this  Committee show that there is  no real agreement between the Dominions.    Canadian officials appear to have no  instructions.    New Zealandwould have asked for more, South Africa for less.      Until reports of Co-ordinating Committee are available on all requests affective discussions are impracticable.    Result of further  discussion on what Dominions can offer us will influence ourconoidera.tion of these requests.   This discussion willv/e hope   include consideration of question of progressive reduction of duties on United Kingdom imports.    our attitude to quantitative restriction(s) can to someextent be inferred from statement of the Chancellorof  the Exchequer on Monetary policy in  course of  whichhe suggested as regards Commodities whose world price is governed by sterling market price, that the regulationof the supply would be preferable to the regulation ofimports into United Kingdom, but apart  from this  wehave  in the meantime expressed no views.
