AIR  RAID  SHELTERSReport of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s  conference the issues committed to the Conference   1. The Conference was convened by the Lord Privy Seal on the24th February,  1939, for  the purpose of advising him upon certain aspects of air raid shelter policy.   On the 21sf December, 1938, theLord Privy Seal, when outlining in the House of Commons the shelterpolicy decided  upon by  the  Government, stated that  immediate steps.would be taken to provide the  widest possible  measure ofprotection for the  civil population against the  effects  of splintersand blast and the fall of debris.   He added that the problem of theprovision of heavily protected shelters  remained for consideration.In his speech in the House of Commons on the 1st March, 1939, heagain explained that the issues involved in the adoption of a policybased on the provision of heavily protected shelters- still remainedfor consideration.   It is on the issues underlying this problem thatwe have been asked to advise.                          - -   2. Since the 24th February we have been frequently in session,and have, from time to time, called into  consultation representativesof the Air Staff, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis,  andthe Technical Advisers of the Home Office, as well as  other distin-distinguished engineers, scientists and public men, who have been engagedin the study of relevant problems, and who, in some cases have taken part in public discussion of them.  From all of them we have receivedthe readiest co-operation, and we wish to place on record an expression of our gratitude to them.   3. In  approaching an examination  of the issues  underlying  apolicy based on heavily protected shelters we must take cognisanceof a number of inter-related factors.  Thus we have to take accountof the measure  of protection likely to be secured by other means,such as evacuation, the provision of shelter against  splinters and blast,  or  the like, which may  already  have been adopted by theGovernment.  But the policy of providing heavily protected sheltersalso involves a range of considerations peculiar to itself.  These willCertain major considerations involved
^emerge more fully at a later stage of this report;  and it is here only necessary to refer to  the fact that a widely extended provision of heavy protection might involve dangers such as those of creating a shelter mentality; of interrupting the processes of essential produiS^n, or of unduly diverting national effort from other measures of defence. No one of these need be decisive in itself, but, taken in combination, they must be an important element in the determination of policy. It will not be out of place, therefore, to make certain preliminary observations oh the subject of the &quot;general objective which, in our view, must  be  considered in designing methods  of passive defence to be adopted in time of war.    4. When the country is at war, the main considerations which must be  borne in mind appear to be the following.  The firsthand indeed ah overriding  consideration, is the necessity of safeguarding activities essential for the successful prosecution of the war. Secondly, the maintenance  of the  nation&apos;s  industries and services must be ensured to  the utmost possible extent.  This  does not mean only the carrying on of such vital public services as water, lighting and transport,  the  production and distribution  of  food, and  other necessaries of life, and the maintenance of the economic life of our own population.  It  involves  also the maintenance of production and  manufacture for export, since this country requires imports in oriler to  live, and they will still have to be paid for,  in  war-tirrie as in peace, by exports.  Thirdly, though it is  obvious that, if the country  is attacked by air, then  civilian casualties  on some scale cannot be avoided, yet there is clearly some stage at which casualties will  cause demoralization and impairment of effort.  This result would be particularly prone to follow should it  emerge that heavy casualties had occurred in an area which had been afforded a standard of protection inferior to that afforded to other  areas exposed to a similar degree of danger.  It is of the first importance therefore that the  Government,  in determining  its  shelter  policy  should not contemplate a  measure of protection  for any one area  if it cannot ensure that it  will be fully extended to all other areas similarly circumstanced.    5. While we  have had  prominently in mind the primary con- siderations  which are outlined  above, it is  necessary also to refer briefly to a number of specific matters which may be  regarded as affecting  or conditioning, in  one  way or another,  the  approach to the. problem with Which we  are directly  concerned.   Among these matters  are :.  the probable nature  of  attack ; the relation between  active  and  passive  defence ;  the  policy intended to be adopted  in regard to  black-outs, evacuation,  and  the length of warning  of air  raids to  be given to the public; and the  special question, of the protection to be afforded to those activities which are connected with, and have of necessity to  be carried on during the actual raids.  .  &quot;              ......  -     &quot;...       &quot;
   ......        &apos; Probable nature of attack C^&apos;-  Air Attack can bo aimed at-                        ...      - (i) military  objectives, such  as  aerodromes, arsenals,  or &quot;.  dockyards-;   .-  .   &apos; :i             .        &quot;   -..       (ii) industrial objectives,  such ais,, ports,  gas  of. electric    power-stations, key factories, or food warehouses; or       (iii) centres.Of population as such.  In this country industrial  5 objectives-lie generally (although we are aware of certain recent    developments tending in the opposite  direction)  in the midst   - of centres of population.  Moreover, if  active defence measures    are effective, hostile  aircraft will be kept at a height., which    makes precision of aim less likely, and will also tend to be forced    away from  intended targets.  Thus, while it seems probable .   that military arid&apos;industrial objectives will be the primary  -  objects of attack,;it is difficult &quot;to feel sure that the results will    differ greatly from those of  attack  on centres.&apos;.of population    as such, though it is prudent to prepare for a possibility that the    weight of bombing on .or very near  to special targets will  be    relatively heavy.  Again, it must not be forgotten that enemy    policy is  capable of  adjustment to  known defensive plans.    For example, if a policy involving the general use of  deep    underground shelters were  adopted,  an  enemy  might - take    advantage of this fact to immobilise the population by  feint    attacks...  It appears, in  consequence, that  only  a  limited    measure  of  guidance  can be obtained from assumptions based    on the  character  and  direction which air  attack may take.&quot;    In particular, we  are impressed  by the probability that views    formed in advance as to the relative vulnerability of different    areas must  be liable to constant revision in the light of actual    experience of the  character of the attack  and of the efficiency    of active defence measures.   7. Among the uncertain factors is that as to the greatest size ofbomb of which use  has to be contemplated.  On this point we have felt it necessary to make an assumption.   On the advice given to us,we have assumed, for the purpose of our enquiry, the possible use ofthe 500 lb. bomb.   8. Attack may  include  the use  of gas  ; but,  recognizing thatthere has been  the  universal issue of gas masks to the population,we  have drawn no  conclusions which are dependent on reliance on special construction to provide protection  against gas.  Such pro-tectipn may be  advisable, e.g., in the case  of larger shelters ;  but,if this proves to be the case, it will not, we think, affect our generalargument or  conclusions..

                    Active and Passive- Defence   9. It is not part of our task to make recommendations as to ac Vair defence, e.g.,  defence  by fighter planes and anti-aircraft  guns.Act;ve i and  passive  defence are,  however,  closely inter-related.Active defence, by keeping the enemy away from their  objectives,can not only protect directly the fives of the inhabitants,, but canprotect also their homes  and the factories, means of food-supply,public services, and the like, on which both the prosecution of warand  the livelihood erf the nation depend.   In proportion as moreelaborate  and expensive proposals for passive defence are brought forward, the question must arise more and more, insistently whethercraftmanship and&quot; material resources could not better be utilised onthe improvement of active defence, or- in some other direction wherethey  would better contribute  to ensuring victory.   It  is of somesignificance also, as one observer impressed upon us,  that the publicmorale, during the air raids on Barcelona, was greatly sustained bythe knowledge that the raiders were being actively engaged by thedefending forces.                           Black-outs   10. We have been given to understand that  it is the acceptedpolicy that in time of war a condition of complete black-out wouldbe maintained, so as to avoid giving guidance  to raiders.   We have heard arguments to the effect that in the  case of some  cities, and,in particular, of London,  there is little hope that they can, entirelyescape recognition by raiders,  so that a complete black-out wouldnot be fully effective, while, at  the same time, it would enhance thedifficulty experienced by  persons out of doors in reaching shelter,and  would also, no doubt,  adversely  affect the psychology  of thepublic.  We must, however, in any event assume that the ordinarystreet fighting, which might  reveal too clearly to raiders the topo-graphy of a city, would not be maintained.  We think it right at thispoint to stress the importance of measures designed  to  secure thatthose whose duty it  is to be abroad, whether on casualty or repair work, and also those seeking refuge, should be afforded some visualguidance in reaching their objective.                           Evacuation   11. Whilst evacuation policy as  such is not directly  within thescope of our inquiry, it is complementary to shelter- policy, and mustto some, extent condition it, inasmuch as evacuated persons will not require the provision of shelter accommodation in the neighbourhoodfrom which they have been removed.  The Government have already announced a decision in favour of the evacuation of children andcertain other classes of persons from areas regarded as comparativelyvulnerable;  the estimated numbers amount in all, we understand,
to something like 30&quot;per cent, of the population of those areas.   It isessential that children should.be spared, as far as possible, from the risks and horrors of war.   No shelter policy could be devised which wouldeifiltively select children for exceptional treatment, or discriminatein favour of expectant mothers, the blind, the bedridden, or the veryaged. For such classes, evacuation can be the only right policy. Wenote also  that the  Government would provide organised facilitiesfor the evacuation  of substantial numbers of  people from certainindustrial areas.   We ourselves have assumed, in our paragraph 13,that additional  evacuation, though on a  different  basis, may berequired in certain special circumstances.   12. We have  in any case contemplated only the evacuation of people from their homes, not the abandonment of such industrial establishments as are likely to be particular objects of attack.  Suchestablishments are  indeed  precisely those which  it is  necessaryshould continue  to  function during war.   There  might be  some instances where  abandonment would be possible, or even desirable,if  alternative, means of production  could  be arranged  elsewhere;but  a general policy  of  abandonment of  important  industrial establishments would almost be equivalent to surrender.   13. There  may be some localities where a particular target isthought to be so exceptionally liable to heavy attack,  or to thedanger of explosions, that no resident ought to be allowed to remainin its near vicinity, and that, in consequence, a strictly limited area,say, within a radius of 300 yards, should be cleared of ail its residents,a process quite different from the selective evacuation at present in contemplation.  Tn that case it may be necessary to remove theresidents to some -considerable distance since, if they were merelymoved a little farther out, they would in most cases be adding furthernumbers to already congested areas, and  so create  a new dangerproblem in that direction.   We  remark here that we have had beforeus proposals involving complete clearance of the population  fromconsiderable areas.   In  our opinion complete clearance  is unlikely to be needed  except in the cases to which we have-referred  abovebut we would add  here that if in any case it is decided to  applyevacuation compulsorily. it must  be in a -complete- form. &apos; Partialevacuation  on  a compulsory  basis would involve problems  of discrimination which would be exceedingly difficult of solution.                       Length of warning -.             ..   14. We are advised that we  may count upon there being betweenthe warning signal and the arrival of hostile  aeroplanes,, a period ofabout seven minutes for the bulk of the country,, though coast  townsin the direction of  approach, may not be able to receive, so much.We understand that this period might possibly be increased, but only(C33819)B*2
                                i                                8at the cost of making the warning indiscriminately applicable to alarge  part of the country, instead of limiting it to those particular areas  over which it may seem reasonably certain that the raiderswill successively pass.  It has to be remembered that in five min^tsa modern bomber may travel something like 25 miles.  If an over-long warning period were adopted, the immobilization of productiveand other activity over a considerable part of the country could bebrought about by a few raiders, who, possibly at small risk to them-selves, penetrated just far enough to put the signals into operation.Since in  a high  proportion of cases  the warning would turn out tohave been a false alarm, it would also tend to make people indifferent to the signals a&apos;nd thus neglectful of precautions which might bevery  necessary  on  a later occasion.  The  undesirability of givingthe alarm unnecessarily to large parts of the country, which eventual-ally prove to be well away from the track of the raiders, has to be balanced against the requirement of giving sufficient notice to enablepeople to take cover.  We see no ground for criticizing the adoptionof approximately seven minutes as the period of warning to be aimed at, and our conclusions  have  been framed accordingly.                        The element of cost   15. In an issue of such vital concern to the existence of the nation,the problem of cost is of  relative rather than of absolute importance.The measure of justification for shelter expenditure lies in the extentto which  it can contribute to  the successful conclusion of the warand the preservation of the life of the nation.  It must therefore be assessed in the light of the other commitments of the country for theprovision of defence.   We ourselves, in formulating our conclusions,have  given less weight to cost as such than to other factors such as,for instance, the period  within which any given scheme of defencecould be completed, or the availability of the labour  and materialsrequired.   16. We think it right, however, to enter a word of warning againsta too ready acceptance of some of the estimates of cost which havebeen  put forward, especially in respect of deep shelter propositions.We have good reason  to believe  that many of these are substantialunder-estimates.              Protection of certain emergency services    17. Throughout this  report we have in mind shelters designed toprotect their occupants,  who,  in resorting to  them, will have sus-pended their ordinary activities.  But there is also the question ofthe protection to be afforded to those engaged in certain activitiesthe carrying on  of which during raids will be of crucial importance ;for example,  surgical services,  the working  of  casualty clearingstations, telephonic communications, key points in the direction of
active : and, passive  defence, and the like. . We  consider  that  theprovision of an adequate scale  of protection for such services shouldrevive special consideration..  The nature of.the problem in the light, of the preceding considerations    18. The problem of shelters cannot be regarded in the light ofa contest between a deep shelter policy and a shallow shelter policy.The solution of the problem can only be&apos;achieved by forming an appreciation of the kind and degree of the danger to be apprehended,&apos;and adopting the measures best suited to meet the case. The universalprovision of complete immunity from risk is impossible. What hasto be  sought is a balanced programme  of reasonable protection,bearing in mind first that the  factor of time is of vital importance,and secondly that it is essential to avoid an immoderate diversion ofthe hation&apos;s effort from other activities directed to the maintenanceof its own existence and the successful prosecution of  war.  Thereare many regions where it should be possible to  trust  more to theunlikelihood of attack than to the provision of shelters, which wouldin such  cases represent a diversion of public funds  and  energiesfrom more legitimate objectives.  At the other end of the scale thereare, as we shall later notice, certain localities which must be regardedas particularly  liable  to be heavily  attacked, and where  special measures may therefore be justified.  We  must again remark thatit is necessary to aim, in general, at  the provision  of an equal degreeof protection, by one method or another, for areas  which  appear tobe approximately equal  in their liability to danger.                       Degrees of protection   19. The protection afforded by a shelter is a question of degree,being related to the size and nature of the bombs that may be dropped and to the distance at which they fall.  Even to lie on the ground,or to  stand in a doorway, may afford some protection.  To be insidea house, out  of range of windows, should give appreciable protection against blast* and  splinters, though there will still remain  the contingent danger of the  collapse of the  structure  and the fall ofdebris,  against  which special  measures  must be  provided.  Thestandard  type of partly-sunken steel  shelter,  overlaid with  theexcavated earth, has been  proved by  actual experiment  to  giveprotection, certainly at a distance of 50 ft.,  and possibly at as little as 30 ft.,  against the splinters  of a  500  lb. high-explosive  bomb.If we do not state our belief that it gives  a corresponding degree ofprotection against blast,  this is because we feel  that  investigation is- still required into certain aspects of the effect  of blast.  Covered    *  By &quot; blast &quot; we mean intensely high pressure created by explosion inthe air -which surrounds the explosion itself,
trenches will afford a  protection against splinters  and blast whichvaries according to their location and construction.  A refuge maybe proof against a direct hit from a 25 lb. bomb, but not from-aneof 500  lb.  Another  may be proof against a  &quot; general purpose  )bomb of a certain weight, but not against an armour-piercing bombof the same weight.  One type may be more resistant to penetration,and another to the effect of explosion.  What we wish to emphasiseis that consideration of the question of protection does not indicatean exclusive choice of one particular type of shelter, but  that thereare- wide degrees  of variation.   20. The term &quot; bomb-proof &quot; should properly connote.a structurewhich provides complete protection against any bomb, and we haveno doubt that it  lies within&apos;the resources, of engineering science to devise shelters providing that degree of protection.   In what follows,however, we shall confine ourselves to considering the  question ofstructures which  are heavily protected  in  the  sense that they are designed  to  afford  a high, though not necessarily an absolute,protection against the direct or near hit of a 500 lb. delayed actionbomb.  Without going deeply into the technical details we are givento understand that, against bombs of this description, [a) a. shelterwhich relies on depth alone for protection should be some 60 to 80 feetbelow ground, according to the nature of the soil; (b) a shelterwhich relies on reinforced concrete should be covered by        (i) a shield or canopy of 3 feet or more of concrete ;        (ii) below that a substantial expansion chamber of air, or of    some medium such as sand ; and        (iii)  below that again a concrete roof of at least 2 feet 6 inches    in  thickness, preferably supported by a steel lining.   At the    same time, since impact is liable to  be at an angle of from    170 to 30o or more, the upper canopy must, in the  absence of    adequate lateral protection, overlap the shelter by an amount    varying with the depth of the  latter.   In regard to lateral    protection, as distinct from  overhead cover,  it  is difficult    to  say  anything  definite  in the present state of  knowledge.    The range of danger  from a shock  transmitted through  earth    seems to be at present almost unknown.   This is  one of  the    fields in which, as we shall indicate later,  immediate  practical    research  is required.    21.  It is of the highest importance to realise that the degree ofprotection afforded by a  shelter depends on its  accessibility as wellas on its strength.  However perfectly  a strongly-protected sheltermay be designed, it can afford its protection only to that proportionof the population which on any given occasion can find its way into it.
     ,     .7-^ circiwlstaiices in lehichprotection is required    ^, 22.; The circumstances in  which people may  require  to  takesjjpter may, in general, be considered  Under three heads, ue\) whenthey are at home; when they are at their places of work, or when theyare,  for example, in the streets.  We shall consider first the case of people in their homes, and then  apply to the other cases the same considerations with such  qualifications as may be necessary.  Thefact  that protection is required in these  different circumstancesbrings out  clearly that the  aggregate of  shelter accommodationmust often very considerably exceed the resident population of theareas concerned, as indicated by the census figures.   An  extremeillustration is provided by the City of London, where only i 1,000people sleep, but where over 500,000 work and at any given time by day additional scores of thousands may  be casUally  present.A  similar situation, though  on  a less impressive  scale, exists inmany other large  urban areas.               Dispersed shelters and public shelters   23. It is possible for a household either to  have its shelter on,or adjacent to, its own premises, or to have available to it accom-modation in a public shelter.   The considerations that apply in thetwo  cases are different, and will now be separately examined.             Public shelters The question of approach   24; The length of the warning, by determining the distance whichcan  be  covered during its currency, has a direct and controllingeffect upon the distribution and size  of shelters.  It  is  therefore essential to determine what  is the maximum  extent.of movementupon whidh it would be right  to rely.   Allowance has to be madefor-        (i)  Loss of time, especially at night, before the people emerge     into the street and begin to move towards the shelter entrance.     A time,- which is quite appreciable in relation to a period of a     few minutes,  may be occupied in taking measures against fire,     putting on  shoes  and clothing, going  downstairs  from iipper     floots, and so oil.        (ii) The fact that normally in a town the rectilinear lay-out     of streets increases distances measured as the crow flies.        (iii)  The  cumulative  crowding of  persons  in  the  street     Converging on the shelter, especially when it is recognised that     the last-comers, coming from the greatest distance, will be much     more numerous than the fust-comers.   If a circular area with     an  evenly  distributed population  is regarded as divided into.     four concentric bands by circles of radius 1, 2, 3 and 4 minutes&apos;   .  walk, for every person within the first circle there are 3, 5 and 7
    within- the successive  rings,  so that  if the period of effective    movement through  the streets be regarded as the last  four    minutes  of the warning period, almost one-half of the people    might be expected to  arrive  within the final minute.      ffeV  &apos;    (iv)  The difficulty of movement by night in the darkness of    a  war-time &quot;black-out,&quot;  even assuming  as  we do, a system    of signs and directions pointing the way-to shelters.   25. Those whom we have consulted have differently assessed theeffect of these factors, but on  the  whole  we are inclined to accept as reasonable the view that it would be wrong to count on movementsexceeding 300 yards by day or 150 yards by night, and in most cases it - would be  the latter  which  would be the  controlling factor.So far as night conditions are concerned, the population may, ifwe ignore the effect of evacuation, be  gauged by the census figures.It is-  only; in  a few  cases that  the  population,-as so  measured,reaches a density of 100,000 to the square mile.  Thus we reach theconclusion that it  would  only be in rare  cases  that  more  than,250 persons would  be  found  within  a distance of   150  yards(equivalent perhaps to a little over 100 yards measured as the crowflies) - which &apos; we take  to  be  the  reasonable limit of movement by night.  &apos; This, apart from other considerations  which we shall noticelater,  must be conclusive against very large shelters for use by night.   26. The legitimacy of the foregoing conclusions would naturally be affected if a less cautious conclusion had been reached as to theextent of movement, but we cannot too strongly insist that this isnot a field in which a margin of error erring on the side of optimismcan be allowed.   If experience in Barcelona has taught anything, itis the danger to persons thronging the streets,  and it is unnecessary to dwell on the situation that would arise if a considerable  proportionof the public were left still struggling towards their refuges as hostileraiders appeared overhead.           Public shelters Type  and capacity of entrance   27.  Assuming, however, that the people have reached the entrance to the shelter, the problem is only half solved,  for there remains the difficult question of the means of entrance, a difficulty which variesgreatly with the type of shelter.   The  first question is whether entrances should take the form oframps or of stairs.  We feel  very strongly.that  ramps are to be preferred.  Not only are they  better adapted to the movement of acrowd in a. confined space, but  they present less difficulty to theremoval of casualties should need arise. It is our view that gradientsshould not exceed  1 in 8,  a figure which indeed, in the opinion ofsome, is too steep to be consistent with safety in the circumstances which we are considering.   Stairs  are, in our opinion, likely to4ead
to confusion and, unless provided with frequent landings, even&apos;todisaster.   We  think that spiral stairs should be excluded&apos; altogether from consideration.   It has, however, to be appreciated that rampederf^)ances of a gradient  of 1 in 8 must in the case of deep sheltersbe of great length ;  a rough index is to be found in the calculationthat for every  10 feet of depth 27 yards of ramp would be required.One consideration seems to  us of paramount importance, namely,that the entrance should be so designed and constructed as to excludeany possibility that early arrivals may, by taking up their positionsthere, hamper or prevent the entrance of  later  arrivals.  For thesame general reason doors or gates, intended to be closed at a givenmoment  possibly in  the  face of  late-comers, must be viewed with grave apprehension.   There is a further question  which  arises inthose cases where the means of access proposed is by a long straightramp or sloping tunnel, or  where the design of the shelter itselfconsists of a single large  spiral ramp.  Our attention has been called to the risk that in such  a case, if a bomb bursts near the entrance,so that the opening of the ramp becomes exposed to the blast, then,in the absence of suitable baffling, the full effect of the blast mightbe conducted without diminution throughout the length of the ramp,and everyone therein, at whatever distance,  be killed.  This  also isone of the points on which we have suggested that research is required.   28.  A further question which would have to be  considered isthat.of the width and rate of intake of individual  entrances.  Wehave received some interesting data as to the estimated rate  of flowthrough  various  widths  of entrance.   Figures based on tests madeby  the  London Passenger  Transport  Board have indicated  thenumber of persons passing through certain entrances and subwaysat central area stations in times of heavy traffic during short periods of exceptional pressure.  The people were all moving in one direction,and the; pressure was not great  enough either to cause congestionor prevent movement.   The results showed that  the number ofpersons ranged as a rule from 100 to 120 per minute per 4 feet width,but the movement capacity did not appear to increase proportionatelyto an increase  in width.   Some tests  which were taken  at the  exitfrom a large football-ground  on the 18th March showed that between605 and 665 persons per minute passed through an exit 24  feet4 inches  wide, which was divided  by barriers into four lanes of anaverage  width Of  about 6  feet.  This rate, namely, rather over25 persons per minute per  foot  width, is about the  same as thatshown in the Transport Board&apos;s  tests.   Similar tests taken through6 feet  wide exits at  another football-ground gave slightly higher rates of  movement.   It  may be noted that the crowds concernedin the case of the football-grounds would be mostly men, with youngerand middle-aged men predominating,  so that the rates  obtainedare probably  maximum averages under  orderly  conditions.  in providing accesses to an air raid shelter, it would  seem unsafe toallow for more than about  20 persons entering per  minute through
each foot of width of entrance,&apos;.  It would also uppeiirto be requisitethat each individual entrance should not be.less than 5 feet wide;nor more than 20 fnet, and  further that, as  clearly demonstratedby the experience quoted above,: wide entrances must  hi anybe divided by barriers into lanes.                Public shelters  Focal or  Ramifiedr   29. It has been generally recognised to  be  impracticable to embark upon extensive excavation under existing buildings ; and,Owing to the nature of the layout  of a normal town area, proposalsfor public shelters (other than those which envisage the use ofportions of existing buildings) have, in general, been based either onthe use of parks and similar open spaces, (&quot; focal &quot; shelters) of onsomething in the nature of tunnels following the line of the streets(&quot; ramified &quot; shelters).  These two  main types  are dealt  with inthe succeeding paragraphs.   Either type  may be designed to serve a peace-time  as well  as  a war-time use ; and  We shall examineseparately the  special considerations  applicable  to  such &quot; dualpurpose &quot; shelters.                          Focal shelters   30. Most of the shelter propositions which have been put forwardare of the focal type.  We have devoted some attention to one such scheme, which has recently attracted a good  deal  of public notice,since, while presenting points of  great interest, it seems to  us toexemplify some of the features to  which we have earlier referred.   31. This scheme, in the form in which it was presented  to us,  isworked out in terms of shelters which have of necessity, owing to thepaucity of open spaces ^ been designed to hold 7,000 or more occu-pants each.   The  authors have worked upon  the basis that  thepopulation may be drawn from distances  up to 380 yards, measuredas the  crow flies,  which might well  mean  550 yards  of  distancethrough the  streets.  We have already given reasons for our hehf-that this is too  great a distance to, be consistent with safety.  ,32. A second, point is that, in the design as it stands, the en-trances allowed for are assumed  to be  capable  of admitting from45 to 60  persons per minute per foot of  width ;  and, eVen so, it  is recognised by the sponsors of the scheme that in the last minute, orminutes,  the arrivals would  exceed  the intake capacity.  If,  as wehave concluded, the best rate of intake to be hoped for is less than half the rate postulated, it would seem certain that there would be alarge, number of persons who for this reason would fail to reachsafety, apar-t from those who, by reason of  mere distance, would arrive too late,                                        ......
   33. It is also assumed in the scheme, and is an.essential assnmp-tion if the- shelter is to hold the number of people for wlKmr it-isimpended  to provide, that the  first arrivals  would proceed  jn  ancKperly way to the lowest level down the spiral ramps which form the floor space of the  shelter, and that the shelter would thus be-filledprogressively and  smoothly.  We must  question this assumption,   34. In regard to focal shelters in general, there are.two furtherconsiderations to winch we would refer.   The first relates to -the,time required for construction.  Estimates of time are sometimes givenin relation to a particular proposition ;  but &quot;it seems certain that anestimate which  is reasonable  when construction  of one  shelter or group of shelters is considered in isolation,  cannot  form a reliableindication of the time which would be required to construct a.great number of shelters, since questions would arise of the ,scale on whichthe necessary  materials,  plant, labour, and supervisory staff  wouldbe available.                                 - -.-            ...   35. In the second place, we draw attention to a risk which isinherent in the concentration of people in large shelters.  Should theprotection afforded fail, through the use  of exceptionally .heavybombs or for any other  reason, a single bomb might wipe out thewhole of  the occupants  of a  shelter.   Disasters  in civil life:haveshown that  such mass catastrophes have a far greater effect uponthe public mind than a similar number  of isolated casualties.                        Ramified Shelters     &apos; .....   36. We pass to the question of a system  of galleries or tunnelsunder streets  (whether forming a  network of in isolated lengths)which, if sufficiently frequent entrances were provided, Wouldbringthe shelter nearer to the home than is possible with the focal type of shelter.   There are, however, practical difficulties which seem to usto be so great as to preclude construction of  this  type on anything like a large scale.                                       - &apos;     &quot;   37. We have the advantage of having had before us a&apos; consultingengineer who  has  an exceptional experience of tunnelling&apos;work.From, this evidence two points seem, to  emerge clearly.   In the;firstplace, it may be assumed that conditions in the majority of streetsin our large cities  exclude the  possibility, which was exploited tosome extent in  Barcelona, of surface working.  An assortment ofmains, gas,  electric and water,  generally  occupy the whole  of the under-surface of our main streets, and below  this to a depth oftenexceeding 30 feet-lie the sewers.   Construction must, therefore, beeffected &quot; in tunnel,&quot; namely, by driving vertical shafts and workinglaterally from  their bases.  Extensive  experience of undergtoundrailway work in London points to a Very definite limit to the maximum rate at which-taking  into account plant, supervisory  staff,  and
labour-^work could be carried out, even if other demands on thissection of industry wei-e substantially reduced.  The. authority towhom we have referred, addressing himself to the question of tunn^Jsof the. 12 feet&apos;diameter, for which the readily available typeljfexcavating plant are adapted, gave it as his view that we could notconfidently count upon constructing in London, within a  period oftwo years, sixteen miles of  such tunnel  shelters.  This length oftunnel would have the capacity to house some 160,000 persons.  Anysuch extension of this figure as we should regard as reasonably possiblewoUld make very little impression on the problem of the country as awhole.&apos;   He explained that by making tunnels of  16 feet 6 inchesdiameter, capable of  accommodating refugees on two storeys, thenumber  of persons for whom such  accommodation could be con-structed in a  given  time would be  considerably increased.  we doubt, hqwever, whether this expedient would be of practical value,for while a 16 feet 6 inches tunnel is estimated to hold about 30,000persons  per mile, there must be few, if any, places where  the corre-sponding concentration of pupulation (say, 200,000 to the  squaremi!e);would be located near enough on either  side of the tunnel toenable advantage to  be taken of the additional accommodation so available.   Indeed, a tunnel of such large capacity must approximate in character to a typical focal shelter, and be subject to the difficulties and drawbacks which we have already shown  to be associated with such shelters.    38. It  seems clear, therefore, that the construction  of tunnel shelters must, if they are to be completed in any commensurable time, be restricted in extent.    ; 39. r Before we leave the tunnel type of shelter, there is one special aspect of the  matter, peculiar we believe to London, to  which we haye.-devoted&apos;some attention.  We refer to the underground railway system^; much  of which affords a high degree of protection.  We assume that the system would continue in war-time to be used for traffic ; and in any case we  doubt whether, having due regard to its extent and to the comparatively limited means of access, the system coulcLmake more than a  partial contribution to the general shelter problem^  It may, however, lend itself to a special use, namely, the treatment and clearance  of casualties.   It would seem worth  con- sideration whether,  by making  additional excavations  at. or  near existing railway stations, it would not be possible to provide pro- tected: casualty  clearing  stations  from  which evacuation  of  the wounded after treatment would be comparatively easy.                      &quot; Dual purpose &quot; shelters     40.  We have naturally devoted attention to the possibility of  finding at one stroke  a joint solution to the  problem of  alleviating  traffic&apos;congestion and to that of providing shelters against air raids,
   41. One type of proposal contemplates a system of undergroundtrunk roads which would be utilised as shelters.  It seems to us thatsuch,roads, if planned in relation to traffic needs, would not be. sos^^fed  as to. provide  any substantial  contribution  to  air. raidshelter needs, for which purpose entrances of. a totally.different typeand scale would be required ;  and,  taking account of the difficulty;to which we  have already referred, of rapid tunnel constructionon a large  scale, we. are  led to the  conclusion that schemes of thiskind do not offer a solution of our  problem,               .  .,    ,   42. The other proposal is for the provision,  under open spaces,of car parks which, would also serve as  shelters.  The issues under-lying such proposals are, at the request of the Lord Privy Seal,being made the  subject of special examination  by  distinguishedconsulting engineers, and.although we have had the benefit of their advice, we feel that we must  exercise care in expressing a view in anticipation of their report.  It does, however, appear to us that anunderground  car  park must of necessity  be reasonably large, andmust therefore be heavily  protected on account of  the magaitudeof the risk. What we have said in discussing focal shelters is, accord-ingly, of general relevance.  The shallow construction envisaged, insome  proposals would, it is true,  reduce some of the  difficulties,for instance that of constructing a sufficiency of suitable entrances.But the mere fact that a shelter would be useful in other ways wouldnot remove our objections if, considered.only as a shelter,  it was iiiadapted for the purpose..                              V &apos;  C             Public shelters General considerations   43.  In the foregoing  passages  we  have  given reason for dis-counting the view that citizens provided with public  shelters, how-eyer strongly  protected these shelters may be, are thereby  madecompletely safe.   We must indeed record  our conviction that. auniversal provision of strongly protected public shelters would-be farfrom making the community &quot;100 per cent, safe.&quot;  Let us considerthe position of an average household on the occurrence of a raid by night.  Within seven minutes of the warning every member must be safe within the: public shelter. -There are-members  of  the  familyto be awakened, the need for finding and putting on warm clothes,gas to be cut off,  and perhaps stairs to be gone. down ; then ajourney through black or very faintly illuminated streets, jostlingwith other.refugees  in.various states of excitement  or even panic.When the shelter is successfully reached and entered and not  all will be  successful there is still the discomfort  of  being packedamongst a mass of strangers, some of whom will be temperamentallyless stable than others.  This  is not, we think, an unfair portrayalof the consequences of a  policy based upon the  movement of largenumbers Jrom their homes to-public shelters.  It is, moreover, ascene which might, have  to. be re-enacted night after night.  It is
hot&apos; &quot;tov:be  supposed, that air raids: can take place without, greatdislocation.of the life of the community  and we think that theordinary citizen will realize, this.   But we believe that most Britishcitizens-&apos;: would prefer.to count&apos;upon a less effective protectionisttheir homesj; even though this may make no pretence of warding offdirect-bi? near hits of bombs, if they can be safeguarded against theone danger which must, loom largest in their minds, namely that ofbeingothemsetves, or seeing their.families, buried under fallen roofsor masonry.  We  believe that if they pause to  reflect, that on occasion they may fail.to hear the warning signal, and that the firstindication :of a raid in progress may be the dropping of bombs withinearshot j the advantages &apos;of having some shelter close at hand; will bestill  more  apparent to them.     &apos;          &apos;       ^  .&apos;.    -, -:. ..,..:,:.:  ...&quot; .          . ;  Dispersed shelters     -                ;   &apos;4A::i We&apos;&apos; turn,-.- then, from consideration of the types of-publicshelter-discussed above, to-that- of dispersed shelters, as the means to be generally adopted for the protection&quot; of people who, at the timeof a&apos; raid; are in  their homes.  Such shelters have the merit of pro-vidirig protection&apos; which is readily at hand at a moments notice.Moreover,  they represent the means by which measures affording aconsiderable degree of protection can be complete within a reasonable time; a. fact which seems to. us to be of crucial importance.    45. The question has  then to be  faced, -how. best to -provide protection, on a  dispersal basis, for all those for whom it is required.No figures need  be. adduced to show that it would be impracticable for such shelters, the numbers of which would run into millions, tobe of so &quot;strongly-protected a character as, to withstand the director hear: hit of a  heavy bomb. Short  of this, the question is one ofdegree -;&apos; and in  our  view the aim must be to provide such shelteras will, ;by protecting the  occupants from blast and splinters andfnjrh injury &quot;from falling debris, give immunity from the effects ofany bOrhb that does not fall within a very limited radius.   It mustnot be Overlooked that, once such a degree of protection has been achieyed, in many cases it will be susceptible of further strengthening as need and opportunity arise.    46. A  substantial advance towards-the general provision of such protection can be secured  by the use of  (i)  the  householders own shelter,- i.e., a separate unit  to be erected on or near the premises, whether in steel  or  concrete, and (ii) existing house basements, st rutted where  necessary  to withstand the  fall of  debris..  It is already the  policy of the Government that in the  more  exposed portions of the country steel shelters and basement strutting material should&apos;be supplied  so far  as there  is a scope  for utilising these methods3 Of providing protection.  In the next two paragraphs we offer  some observations upon these two methods..
:&apos;-&apos;      As regards rthrersteel sheltersf the type.distributed by theGovernment, we have m para.r 19; given an. indication of the.: highprotective&apos;.value -it possesses as a  shelter  against splinters, and-weam^ware that it has been tested against the collapse of adjacentbuildings, of a two. ox three-storey type.  We have, in that paragraph,already: recommended -that further  investigation  should  be made into the completeness of its leffloacy against blast.&apos;   - vr.:q     :c;v:   48. Suitable domestic basements,&quot; if strutted as necessary^&apos;offer;approximately equal protection to that provided by the steel shelter,and they often have the added advantage that they can be occupiedwithout leaving the house.  Much that has been said in derogationof the use of basements we do not accept,   To take one instance,it appears to exaggerate the risk to the occupants of basements fromthe. bursting of. water, mains in the street.  In  ail.save exceptional cases, the occupants should have time to escape from such a. danger&quot;.We must, however,  emphasise two points in regard&apos;to the  use: ofbasements.  First,, it..is not by any means every basement thai issuitable, for the  purpose, in view.   In particular, many  &quot; semi-basements &quot;  which  have  considerable window-space, could   notsafely be used unless this space were suitably Sited in.  Secondly,it  is essential,  that a basement refuge, should  have, a second,&quot;and independent, means of exit,- This might,, in many cases,, be.contrivedby the opening of a passage into, an adjoining basement, the aperturebeing covered by a section  of lightly built  wail which  could be quickly demolished, in emergency.  ,            &apos;      ....  s  &apos;..   49.. There  are, however,  areas where the  absence of yard ofgarden space, or of  suitable basements, makes it impracticable&quot;.]toapply either of the two methods discussed above.  We consider ittherefcre to be of paramount importance that alternative  methodssuited for application to such areas should be  devised, and that no time should be lost in putting- them into operation.  The  majorityof such areas^ are likely to* be densely populated by people of smallmeans, and, as they are frequently found in industrial neighbour-hoods,  they will in some instances be  dangerously near to targetsparticularly liable to attack.                    .   5Q. A solution which,  if vahd,  offers the  possibility-of wideapplication would be the use of ground floor rooms, such as: sculleriesand  the like,  to  fill the part played in other areas by basements.The validity of this solution has strong backing- in some responsiblequarters ;  but it  has this substantial drawback,  that the advancepreparation of ground floor rooms must, in general; occasion a muchgreater dislocation of ordinary life.  In any event, we feel that further investigation is required before the matter could be made the subjectof a  Confident  recommendation.   The possibilities latent  in  thesuggestion are however so great that we trust that its consideration
will be treated as: a matter of urgency.   In some neighbourhoods itwill: probably  be  found necessary to purchase and demolish one ormore houses in a group or street, and erect on the site, for the useof the inhabitants of neighbouring houses, an air-raid shelter  p&apos; Jkagainst blast and splinters&quot;.-  In other cases, where there are in thevicinity industrial or other buildings with large basements  suitablefor the purpose, arrangements might be made for these fo.be adaptedand made  available as shelters for  the  occupants of neighbouringhouses.   In yet other cases, there may be the possibility of con-structing galleries Or moderate-sized  concrete shelters on small plotsabove or below ground.          &apos; -  --   -  People at their places of workh--. 51. Among places of work there are some which are particularlylikely to be the  object of heavy attack,  precisely  because of theimportance, of their continued functioning; during war.  The con-centration  of persons at work in; such places involves a very heavyrisk from the public point of view.  Destroyed property can  some:how be restored, or its loss made good, but skilled workmen-andtechnicians are  an  almost irreplaceable  asset.   While,  therefore,we do&apos;not feel special sympathy with the point of view which urgesabsolute safety for. the non-combatant worker, as against the un-doubted risks to which his combatant comrade has to expose himself,we feel that strongly protected shelters ought to be provided at their place Of work for employees in  certain vital industrial undertakings.This provision would also enable these  employees to carry  on their work on each, occasion up to the last possible moment, whereupon a rapid and  orderly  resort  to the shelter could take place ;  and  itwould have the incidental advantage that if,.as the war proceeded,it should prove advisable for them to vacate their homes and live&quot;on the job,&apos;&apos; the : shelter would be available for night-time also.It would be essential that such special shelters should be exclusivelyreserved for  the  employees  for whom  they were designed.  Theymight-be of considerable&apos;size, for it will be realized that what hasbeen  said  earlier as to the disadvantages of providing for greatconcentrations of people in a single shelter, does not apply here.   52: We do not feel that we can ourselves define  what categories of persons at-work should receive this special kind of protection.Only the Government are, we judge,- competent to  do  so and eventheir decisions, which, must  perhaps&apos; in  the first instance be taken on more or less arbitrary grounds, may prove to require modification in the light-of war conditions.-  What we ourselves have  in  mindare such instances as the workers in  aero-engine works in vunerable areas or, again, dock or port workers ; and we recognize that similararguments may be applicable  to some other collections of persons whose.loss might be irreparable, for instance,&apos; surgeons  in hospitals;
 .*. 53.&quot; We recognise thai, in the first days, of ;war, repeateriwartitiitgs&quot;&apos;and,consequent recourse to the shelters provided may do :muctatar.interfere with  production, but  we have the confident belief that:t^^ood-sense  of the British workman will make him do everything possible to carry on his work with the minimum of interruption.   54. While we have made the above recommendations for vital;industries of a highly  specialized character, we are inclined-to the-view  that the  standard  of protection to be aimed at  generally atthe place of work should at least be of such a nature, as-forgive &quot;fullprotection against blast and splinters.   We observe that in the recentCivil Defence Bill the Government propose to take power to  impose upon  a large range of employers a requirement to provide shelter-at work for their employees.                               &quot;   55. As  regards  office staffs in especial, the  business quarters of large  cities  already possess  a  considerable degree  of potentialprotection  in the  shape of modern framed buildings, which  haveespecially valuable qualities in this respect.  In some  of these thebasements, in  particular, could with little  adaptation be used forshelter purposes.  One matter which requires to be urgently con-sidered is the manner in which such basements can be made availableto the occupants of neighbouring buildings which are less satisfactory in this respect, and to members of the public who may happen tobe in the vicinity.   The accommodation available for  this  purpose will be increased in war-time as the result of the vacation  of office buildings by those firms which have arranged to provide themselves with  alternative accommodation in less exposed areas.  Any firmwhich makes  such advance dispositions is,  we  think,  making  a material contribution to the solution of the shelter problem.   56. We note that by Clause 24  of the  Civil Defence  Bill theMinister is to be given powers to impose, in relation to new buildings,or the extension  of existing buildings,  such requirements as  he^considers necessary as  to materials  and  construction,  for thepurpose of rendering the buildings less vulnerable to air raids, andalso  as to  the provision of air raid shelter for persons using orresorting to the buildings.   We consider it to be important. thatthere  should be no hesitation or delay in making the fullest use ofthese  powers.                                                &apos;          People neither at home nor at their places of work   57. The  problem of  providing protection for people who are neither in their homes nor at their places of work presents difficultiesof a special kind, but these are difficulties which  must be overcome,since  otherwise the  population  would  become  immobilised.  Ifdispersal to shelters providing protection against splinters and blast
                Air raid shelters in other countries .  60. We have examined such information as is available regardingthe shelter policies being followed in various  European countries.These are naturally conditioned by the  circumstances of the par-ticular country concerned and have  no necessary  application tothe different circumstances which prevail here.  We have seen nothing which would lead us to believe that if the recommendations of thisReport  are  put into effect,  Britain will have an air raid  sheltersystem less effective than that of other countries.   61. Many attempts have been  made  to urge the experience ofBarcelona, in particular, as  an example for this country.  In thefirst&quot; place, however, we are  satisfied  that the degree  and extentof the protection there given have often been exaggerated.  It seems clear that protection designed to be bomb-proof was available for only a relatively small proportion of the population, and that itsbomb-resisting qualities were not effectively tested.  In the second place, the conditions of the problem, here and  in Barcelona, are sodifferent that comparisons are of no great Value.  Barcelona enjoysa  climate very different from  ours, and exposure to it  by nightinvolves little hardship ; it has an abundance of wide  streets and open spaces,  and its soil permits underground tunnelling to be carriedout by inexperienced hands and without  skilled supervision.can be ^irrangecl, e.g., by the use of larger basements, strengthenedas necessary, trenches, or other equivalent shelters, this is the best solution.  It may,&quot; however, be necessary in some  cases, by reasonof- the intensity, of concentrations and the absence of  any or &quot;Ymeans of providing for  their  needs, to think in terms  of suitablyprepared  shelters of  somewhat greater capacity  and affording  areasonable degree of  protection.  If so, it follows that a propor-tionately higher degree of protection should be provided.   58. We again draw special attention to the possibility of utilising the basements,  and in  some  cases the ground floors,  of modernmany-storeyed  premises  (including  shops)  where considerableprotection is already  present, and  not  much further strengtheningwould be  required.   Anything which tends to  make  the publicresort for refuge to familiar places is to be welcomed as tending tomaintain morale and  confidence.   59. We wish to emphasise that&apos;, in the case of this  element ofthe population,  it is especially needful that dispositions should bemade  for indicating  where shelters  are and for  marshalling  and controlling entry to them.
                    Scope for further research                    &apos; (Qg2.  Our investigation has been hampered by  the  fact. that in-certain aspects of the subject knowledge is still far from complete.There are many relevant technical  and scientific problems  which still  require  elucidation.   Our  attention  has  been  particularlydirected to the need for further exploration of the following points :-       (i) The phenomena of blast, especially &quot; shadow &quot; effects,    and  the value of baffling devices, with particular reference to    the physiological effects Of blast.       (ii) The penetration of bombs  into various classes of soils.       (hi) The  propagation  of  earth  waves  by-  underground    explosions.       (iv) Methods of lighting which would facilitate  movement    at night without impairing the effect of a black-out.We  do  not,   however, suggest that  this  is  by  any  means an exhaustive list.                                          -:   63.  We are aware that research and experiment have during thelast  few months been pursued more systematically  than before,but we are impressed with the extent of the work that still remains to be done.  We understand that some difficulties have been experi-experienced,  such as the  lack of available  ground for the conduct of practical experiments ;  and we  feel in general that  the work of research  is still being conducted on too restricted  a scale.  though we do not overlook the need for long-term, or fundamental research on some of the problems involved, we believe that there are immediate and  pressing requirements in the direction of practical experimentsto settle  certain points, particularly the lethal effects of blast, whichare now  in doubt.  The country possesses, in numerous specialisedinstitutions, in its universities and scientific bodies, ample resources for the conduct of  investigation  and experiment, and  the fullestopportunity should  be taken of seeking their assistance  and  col-laboration.  We wish to draw particular  attention to  the fact that full benefits cannot be  obtained from such collaboration unless those whose assistance is being sought, or who will have to make practicaluse of  the results, are  kept fully  and promptly in touch with theprogress  of investigations conducted by or on behalf of Governmentdepartments.   Need for the presentation of a complete policy of passive defence   64. We recognise that the Government has in recent monthsmade much progress in the formulation  and execution of a-policyof passive defence.   We - cannot, however,  close  our eyes  to theevidence of a lack of  confidence in the public mind as4o the adequacy
fratettthe 6th April, 1939.(csssie) e so  *i$of that policy.  This may be partly due to the fact that its full extentis not yet appreciated ;  but we believe that it is even more to be attributed to the fact that the Government has not yet found if^lin a position to present to the public a complete picture of the schemeof defence which it proposes to undertake.   Ignorance of the Govern-meut&apos;s intentions in regard to strongly protected  shelters has, inparticular, been responsible for much of the prevailing doubt  and uncertainty.  Not until the Government is able  to make public thefull extent of the shelter measures contemplated can it hope to gaina general support  for its  policy,  and thus ensure  that both localbodies and individual  citizens shall  effectively  recognise  their responsibility for taking  their share in  the&apos;preparations, againstattacks by air.  If we have in some measure gone beyond our termsof reference, it is because  we have hoped that by so doing we mayassist the Government in the preparation of a comprehensive schemeof defence policy.   There  can be  no doubt as to the  strength andinsistence of the public demand that measures for protection against air  raids  should  be systematically and unhesitatingly pressed forward.   The scheme of defence which we have suggested may fall short in  some respects of the anticipation entertained  in  some quarters  as to the character of the protection which the Governmentshould undertake to provide.  But after a review of all the circum-stances we consider that it is the right policy for the Governmentto- adopt.  If any legal difficulties are found to stand in the way,.we hope that the Government will not hesitate to equip itself with thepowers necessary to overcome them.    65.

Hutson, for the very great assistance which theyhave rendered to us in the course of our enquiries and the prepara-tion of this report.

COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE         CIVIL DEFENCE  (POLICY) SUB-COMMITTEE               AIR-RAID SHELTER POLICY           Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Privy Seal  &apos;     I attach a short Memorandum on the report of theConference,  convened &quot;by me to consider and advise onthe issues underlying the provision of heavily protectedshelters, and presided over by Lord Hailey, copies ofwhich were circulated yesterday.   1.  The Report puts into proper perspective the questionof shelters as part of civil defence policy.   It pointsout (paragraph 18) that there is not a conflict between&quot;deep&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot; shelters in which one type is manifestlyinferior to the other;  what Is wanted is a balancedprogramme of measures best suited to meet the variousrequirements.   2.  It is decisive against any attempt to provide deepor bomb-proof shelters for the whole civil population, on three main grounds:(i)   the diversion of material, effort and money from      active defence to the last stage of passive defence      (paragraphs 9 and 18) which would be involved in  .      such a task;(ii)  the &quot;technical&quot; difficulties involved.   These are      not the difficulties of constructing a shelter
                                                         70      whose inhabitants would be safe when they are within      it, which is a task not beyond the competence of      engineers, but the difficulties of constructing a      shelter system which would guarantee speedy and      sufficient access to the population which would want      to make use of it,    The safety of a shelter is      the product of its security plus its accessibility      under-the conditions of short warning which must be      accepted as assumptions (paragraphs 24-39);(iii) the time factor of construction.   The &quot;ramified&quot;      form of shelter, i.e. a system of galleries or      tunnels under sifreets which corresponds with the      distribution of population is preferable on grounds      of safety to the &quot;focal&quot; shelte&quot;r, a large shelter      at various places capable of holding large numbers.      But the ramified shelter in its most speedily      constructed form, tunnels of 12 feet in diameter      which could be excavated with plant already available,      would require 2 years for the construction of 16      miles of tunnel in London - and this length of tunnel      would only shelter 160,000 persons (paragraph 37).   3.  For these reasons,  which are supported throughoutthe Report by a variety of arguments, the Conference is infavour of the policy of dispersed shelters giving protection against blast, splinters,  and the fall of debris, wherepeople live and where they work,  and the Report endorsesthe advice already given to me about the value of the specialsteel shelter covered with earth,  and the. design forstrengthened basements (paragraphs 44-50).   4.  The Report however advocates heavier protection (1)
for certain essential defence activities such as surgicalServices, communications,  and &quot;battle headquarters&quot; (paragraph 17) and also  (2)  (paragraphs 51 and 52) forcertain key workers in essential occupations.   5.  In paragraphs 62  and  63 the Report presses for more comprehensive research into  problems of blast, earth waves,etc.   Research into these matters, in relation to civil defence, has admittedly  been slow and inadequate, but theprominence of the shelter problem has made its developmentessential, and the measures  now in hand will enable researchto be undertaken over a  wide field, with the help of outside bodies and persons of scientific distinction.   6.  Subject to the views  of my Colleagues, I propose thatthe Report should be issued  as a Command Paper next week,accompanied by a statement to the effect that the Governmentaccepts the principles of  the Report, though in some mattersof detail further consideration is necessary;  that nothing in the Report calls for  a modification of the Government&apos;policy announced on 21st December last, that immediate action for the provision of  protection against blast, splinters,and the fall of debris is necessary in the vulnerable areas,both for the protection  of people in their homes and attheir place of work;  that the responsibility for protectingpeople in their homes or in  public shelters rests upon thelocal authorities under  the  Act of 1937, with the generousassistance given by the  Government not only in the financial arrangements under that  Act, but in the provision ofmaterials for the special steel shelters, and the strengthening
j^of basements;   and upon the employers for protecting peep I at work under  the terms,  and with the financial assistance from the Exchequer,  proposed in the Civil Defence  Bill0J. A.HOME OFFICE.12th April. 1939
SECRETConclusions of the Fifth Meeting of the Civil Defence (Policy) Committee, held at Richmond Terrace at 11 a.m.              on Friday, 14th April, 1939.THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:-   (i)  to take note of the report of the Conference con-        intervened by the Lord Privy Seal for the purpose of        advising him upon certain aspects of air raid        shelter policy, and presided over by Lord Hailey            The conclusions of the Conference can be        summarised as follows:-        (a)  the rejection for technical and general reasons             of any attempt to provide deep &quot;bomb proof&quot;             shelters on a widespread scale for the protection             of the civil population.        (b)  the endorsement of the policy of providing in             vulnerable areas dispersed splinter and blast             proof protection as rapidly and on as wide a             scale as possible.        (c)  the recommendation, as a supplement to splinter             and blast proof protection, of heavier protection             for personnel engaged in certain essential             defence activities, workers at certain vital             industrial undertakings and  (subject to any             modification that may result from Conclusion             (iv)(b) below) for certain skilled workmen and             technicians &quot;whose loss night be irreparable&quot;.             The organisations and personnel for which this             heavier protection should be provided to be             defined by the Government.   (ii) that the report, subject to amendment in the light        of Conclusion  (iv) below, should be submitted to
       Parliament at an early date by the Lord Privy Real       as  a Command  Paper,  and that the Lord Privy Seal       should at the same time rake a statement in the House       of  Coiuruons on the shelter policy of the Government.(iii)   that a statement should be made, after consultation       with the  Chancellor  of the Exchequer, based on       acceptance of the principles enunciated in the                              report of the Hailey Goh-       reference,  subject &apos;co  che proviso (unless the text of       paragraphs 51 and 52 is modified in accordance with       Conclusion (iv)  below) that, pending further       investigation, the Government must not be regarded       as  committed  to  the  principle of discrimination in       the same  establishment in standards of protection fore-       different categories of personnel when not actually       engaged in their duties. (iv)   to  take note  that the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Office are       ascertaining  before  publication of the report whether       the Air Ministry desire that certain passages should       be  omitted or modified in the light of military       considerations.  (v)&apos;   that the  Lord Privy  Seal&apos; s Office should take up with       Lord Hailey the  possibility of revising the wording       of  sections 51 and 52 so as to make it clear- that       these passages refer to differential  standards of       protection for factories and other centres of       activity as units, based on their relative importance       for the conduct of the war, and not for different       categories of workers within a centre of activity. (vi)   that the minister of Health and the Minister of       Transport should take up with the London Passenger-       Transport Board at once the question  of making use                         2.
        of certain tube  stations  for  Casualty Clearing        Stations;   and. that the Lord  Privy Seal  should,  if        possible,  include  a reference to  this matter  in  his        statement  of  policy in the  House  of Commons,  or  in        answer to  a supplementary Question. (vii)   that the Minister  of Health should ascertain the        views of the  organisations  of the Medical profession        in regard  to  the suggestion in paragraph 52 of  the        report that differential  protection should be        provided for  surgeons in  hospitals.(viii)   that the Report  and the proposals as to  Government        policy forming the subject of the&quot; statement referred        to in (iii) above  should  be submitted by the Lord        Privy Seal to the  Cabinet.
