             STATEMENT  OF  POLICY  In  the  Statement  on Palestine,  issued  on 7th  November,1938,* His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their&apos;.intention..to&quot;invite representatives of the Arabs of Palestine, of certain neigh-bouring countries and of the Jewish Agency to confer with themin London regarding future policy.   It  was their sincere hope.that, as a result of full, free and frank discussion,  some under-standing might  be reached.  Conferences  recently took place with Arab and Jewish delegations, lasting for a period of several weeks,  and  served  the  purpose  of  a  complete exchangeof views between British  Ministers  and  the  Arab  and jewish representatives.  In the light of the discussions as well as of thesituation in Palestine and  of the Reports  of the Royal Corn-mission and the Partition  Commission,  certain proposals wereformulated by His Majesty&apos;-s Government and were laid beforethe Arab and  Jewish  delegations as the  basis of  an agreed settlement.  Neither  the Arab nor  the  Jewish  delegations felt able to accept  these proposals,  and the conferences thereforedid not result  in an agreement.  Accordingly His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are free to formulate their own policy, and after careful consideration they have decided to adhere closely to theproposals  which were finally submitted to the Arab and Jewishdelegations.  2. The  Mandate for Palestine, the terms of which were con-firmed by the Council of  the  League of Nations in 1922, hasgoverned  the policy of successive British  Governments  for nearly 2p years.   It embodies  the Balfour  Declaration and im-poses on  the Mandatory four  main obligations.  These obliga-tions are set out in Articles 2,  6  and 13  of the Mandate.  Thereis no dispute regarding the  interpretation of one of these obliga-tions, that touching  the protection  of and access  to the holy places and religious  buildings or sites.   The other three mainobligations are generally as follows:         (i)  To place the country  under such  political,  adminis-     trative and economic  conditions  as will secure the estab-     lishment in Palestine  of a  national home for the Jewish     people, to  facilitate  Jewish immigration  under suitable     conditions,  and to encourage,  in  co-operation with  the     Jewish Agency,  close  settlement by Jews on the land.       (ii)  To safeguard the civil and religious  rights of all the     inhabitants of Palestine irrespective of  race and religion,     and,, whilst facilitating Jewish immigration and settlement,     to ensure that the rights  and position of other sections of     the population  are not prejudiced.             -       (iii) To place the country under such political, adminis-     trative and economic  conditions as  will secure the develop-     ment  of self-governing institutions.                          * Cmd. 5893.
16379  3- The  Royal Commission  and previous  Commissions ofEnquiry have drawn attention to the ambiguity of certain ex-pressions in the Mandate, such as the expression  &quot; a national-home for the Jewish people &quot;, and  they  have found in  thisambiguity  and  the resulting uncertainty as to the objectives of policy a fundamental cause of unrest and  hostility betweenArabs and  Jews.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are convincedthat in  the interests of both Arabs and Jews  a clear definition of policy and objectives is essential.   The proposal of partitionrecommended by the Royal Commission would have affordedsuch clarity, but partition of the country by the establishmentof self-supporting independent Arab  and Jewish States withinPalestine has been  found to be impracticable.  It has  therefore been necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government  to devise analternative policy which will, consistently with their obligations to Arabs and Jews, meet the needs of the situation in Palestine.Their views and proposals are set forth  below under the threeheads, (I) The Constitution, (II) Immigration, and (III) Transferof Land.                    I. The Constitution.   4.  It has been urged that the expression &quot; a national home for  the Jewish  people &quot;  offered  a  prospect  that  Palestinemight in due course become a  Jewish State or Commonwealth.His Majesty&apos;s  Government do not wish to contest  the view,which was expressed by the Royal Commission, that the Zionistleaders at the  time  of  the  issue of the  Balfour  Declarationrecognised that an  ultimate Jewish State was  not precluded bythe terms of the Declaration. But, with the Royal Commission,His  Majesty&apos;s  Government believe  that  the framers  of theMandate in which the Balfour Declaration  was embodied couldnot  have intended that  Palestine should be  converted into a jewish State against the will of  the Arab population of thecountry.  That Palestine was not to be converted into a jewish state might be held to be  implied  in  the passage from the command Paper of 1922 which reads as follows:         &quot; Unauthorised statements have been made  to the effect     that the purpose in view is to create  a wholly Jewish Pales-     tine.   Phrases  have been used such as that &apos; Palestine  is to     become as Jewish as England is English &apos;.  His Majesty&apos;s     Government regard any such expectation as impracticable     and have no such aim in view.  Nor have they at any  time     contemplated . .... the disappearance or the subordination     of  the Arabic population, language or culture in Palestine.     They  would draw attention to the  fact that  the terms  of     the (Balfour)  Declaration referred to do not  contemplate     that  Palestine  as  a whole  should be converted  into a     Jewish National  Home, but that  such a Home  should     be founded in  Palestine &quot;:.
&quot;-  But this-statement-has; not- removed doubts, and His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore now  declare  unequivocally  that  they would regard it  as contrary  to their obligations to  the: Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given  to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of  Palestine should be  made-the subjects  of  a Jewish-  State against their will,&apos;and consequently it is no  part of their policy that Palestine should become; a-Jewish State&apos;..-,&quot;-.: -5.. The.mature  of the. Jewish. National-Home, in-Palestine was further described in the Command Paper of .1922 as follows;-       &quot; During the last two or three generations the-JeWs-have     recreated in Palestine a community, now numbering 80,000,     of whom about one-fourth are -farmers or workers upon-the     land.   This  community  has  its own&apos; &quot;political; organs-;. %n   ;  elected&apos;assembly for the direction of its  domesticconcerns-;     elected councils in the  towns; and an organisation for the     control of  its schools.  It has its elected Chief&quot;Rabbinate     and Rabbinical Council  for  the direction of its religious     affairs.  Its  business  is  conducted in  Hebrew  as a  ver-     nacular language, and a Hebrew press serves its  needs. It- -   has its distinctive  intellectual  life and displays considerable     economic activity.  This community, then, with its  town     and country population,  its  political, religious and social     organisations, its  own language, its own customs, its  own     life, has in  fact  &apos; national &apos;  &quot;characteristics.-  When  it is     asked what  is meant by the development of the  Jewish  -   National Home in Palestine, it may be answered&apos; that it     is not  the imposition  of a  Jewish  nationality  upon the     inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further develop-     ment of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance   -  of Jews in other  parts of the &quot;world, in order that it  may     become a  centre  in which the Jewish  people as&apos;a whole     may take;  on grounds of religion and race, an interest and     a pride.   But in  order that  this community should  have     the  best prospect of free development  and provide a full     opportunity  for the Jewish  people to display its  capacities,     it is essential that it should know that it is in Palestine as     of right and  not on sufferance.  That is  the reason why it is     necessary that the existence of a Jewish National Home in     Palestine should be internationally guaranteed, and that it     should be  formally recognised to rest upon ancient historic     connection &quot;.   6.  His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to this  interpretation of the  Declaration  of 1917 and regard it as  an authoritive and comprehensive  description  of  the  character  of the Jewish National Home in Palestine.  The interpretation  envisages the further development of the existing Jewish community with the assistance of Jews in  other parts of the  world.  Evidence that
* Cmd. 5974.His Majesty&apos;s Government have been carrying out their obliga-tion  in this respect is to  be found  in the fact  that since thestatement of 1922 was published more than 300,000 Jews haveimmigrated to  Palestine,  and the population of the national home has  risen to some 450,000,  or  approaching a third of theentire population of the country.  Nor  has  the Jewish  com-munity failed to take full  advantage of the opportunities givento it.&apos; The  growth of the Jewish National Home and its achieve-ments-in many  fields are a remarkable constructive effort whichmust command the admiration of the world and  must be, inparticular,  a source of pride  to the Jewish people.  7.&apos; In  the  recent discussions  the Arab  delegations  haverepeated the contention that Palestine was included  within thearea in which  Sir Henry McMahon, on behalf of the BritishGovernment, in  October,  1915,  undertook  to  recognise  and support Arab independence.  The validity of this  claim, basedon  the  terms  of  the  correspondence which  passed between sir Henry  McMahon and  the Sharif  of Mecca, was thoroughlyand  carefully investigated by British and Arab  representativesduring the recent conferences in&quot;London.  Their Report, whichhas been published,*  states  that both the Arab and the british representatives  endeavoured to  understand the point  of view ofthe other party but that they were unable to reach  agreement upon an interpretation of the correspondence.   There is no need to summarise  here  the  arguments   presented  by each  side.His  Majesty&apos;s  Government   regret  the  misunderstandingswhich have arisen Owing to the  lack of precision in the languageused in the correspondence,  and the  difference of opinion which still  exists.  For  their part  they  can only adhere to the viewthat  the whole  of Palestine  west  of Jordan was  excluded fromSir   Henry McMahohs  pledge,  and they  therefore  cannotrecognise the claim, based upon the  McMahon correspondence,that  Palestine should be converted into an Arab State.- 8.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are  charged  as  the MandatoryPower &quot;to secure the development of  self-governing  institu-tions &quot; in  Palestine.  Apart from this specific obligation, theywould regard it as contrary to  the whole spirit of the mandate system that the population of Palestine should remain for everunder  Mandatory tutelage.   It is proper that  the people ofthe country should as early  as possible enjoy the rights of self-government which are exercised by  the people of neighbouring countries..  His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable  at  present to foresee  the. exact constitutional forms which  government inPalestine will eventually take, but their objective is self-govern-ment, and  they desire  to see established ultimately an indepen-dent Palestine  State.   It  should  be  a State in  which  the two
peoples in  Palestine,  Arabs  and Jews,  share  authority  ingovernment in such a way that the essential interests of eachcommunity are secured.  ;  9. The establishment of  an independent State and the com-plete relinquishment of Mandatory control in Palestine are not practicable Until the Arabs and the Jews are able to co-operate effectively  in  the government  of their  country.   Moreover,the  growth  of  self-governing   institutions  in  Palestine,as  in  other  countries, must  be  an  evolutionary  process.A transitional period will  be required before independence is achieved/during which the people of  the country will take an increasing share in the government, and understanding and thepractice of co-operation amongst  them will  be fostered, whileultimate responsibility for the government of the country  will beretained by His Majesty&apos;s Government  as the  Mandatory Power.  10.  In the light of those considerations His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment make the following declaration of their intentions regard-ing the future government of Palestine:         (1) The objective of His Majesty&apos;s Government is the    establishment within ten years of  an independent Palestine    state, possibly of a federal nature, in such treaty relations    with Great Britain as will provide permanently and satisfac-    satisfactorily  for  the  commercial  and strategic  requirements of    both countries.  This proposal for the establishment of the    independent state  would  involve consultation  with  the    Council  of the League of Nations  with  a view  to  the    termination of  the Mandate.       (2) The independent state should be one in which Arabs    and Jews share in government in such a way as to ensure    that the essential interests  of each  community are  safe-    guarded.       (3) The establishment of the independent state will be    preceded  by a  transitional period throughout  which  His    Majesty&apos;s Government, as the Mandatory Power, will retain    responsibility for the government of the country.  During    the transitional period the people of Palestine will be given    an increasing part in the government of their country,  and    the refusal of one section of the population to participate in   . the machinery of government  will  not be allowed to prevent    or delay this process.       (4) As  soon  as peace and  order have been  sufficiently    restored in Palestine steps will be taken to carry  out this    policy of giving the people of Palestine  an increasing part    in the government of  their  country, the objective being to   . place  Palestinians in  charge of all  the  departments of    government, with the assistance of British advisers  and
subject to the control of the High Commissioner.  With thisobject in view His Majesty&apos;s Government will be preparedimmediately to arrange that a number of Palestinians, whoare considered capable of becoming heads of departments,shall  sit on the existing  Advisory and Executive  Councilswhere they will obtain practical experience of the  adminis-tration of their country.   Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve  on these bodies approximately in proportion to their  respective populations;  arrangements will  be  made as  early as  possible, having  regard  to conditions in Palestine,  for some of them to  be placed incharge of certain departments, and  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment anticipate that this step Would  be taken  within  twoyears of the restoration of peace and order.  Thenceforwardthe number of Palestinians in charge of departments wouldbe increased as circumstances permit until all departments had  come under their charge.   (5)  His Majesty&apos;s Government make no proposals at this state  regarding the establishment of an elective  legislature.Nevertheless they  would  regard this as an  appropriateconstitutional development, and, should public opinion inPalestine  hereafter show itself in favour of such a develop-ment, they will be prepared, provided that local conditionspermit, to establish the necessary machinery.  In any case,at the end of five years  from the restoration of peace  andorder, an appropriate body representative of the people ofPalestine   and  of  His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  beappointed to review  the working  of the constitutional arrangements during the transition  period and  to consider and make recommendations  regarding the constitution ofthe independent Palestine state.   (6) His Majesty&apos;s Government will require to be satisfiedthat in the treaty contemplated by sub-paragraph  (1) orin the constitution  contemplated  by sub-paragraph  (5)adequate provision has been made:         (a) for the security of, and freedom of access to, the     Holy Places;       (&amp;) for the protection of  the different communities     in Palestine  in accordance with the obligations of His     Majesty&apos;s  Government to both Arabs and Jews  and     for  the  special position in Palestine of the  Jewish     National Home.His Majesty&apos;s Government will also require to  be satisfiedthat the interests of certain  foreign countries in Palestine,for the preservation of which they are at present responsible,are adequately safeguarded.
 &apos; &apos;   &apos; (7) Failing acceptable recommendations from the. body    referred to in sub-paragraph  (5.) His Majesty&apos;s Government    will  within the period of ten  years  referred to in  sub-    paragraph  (1) re-examine  the  position  and. frame a    constitution on lines which they regard as equitable.      (8) His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  do everything  in    their power to create  conditions  which  will enable  the    independent Palestine state to  come into being within ten    years.  If,  contrary to their hope, they are forced to the    conclusion  at  the end of that period that  conditions  in    Palestine do not render it practicable to set up an jiidepen-    dent state, they reserve the right to postpone its establish-    ment until  such time, as soon  afterwards as possible,  as    conditions are  created which make  it  practicable.   Before    deciding on such postponement, His Majesty&apos;s Government    will  consult  other interested  parties and the neighbouring    Arab States.  11. During the transition period steps will be taken to increasethe  powers and responsibilities of municipal corporations andlocal councils.                      II. Immigration.  12. Under Article 6 of the Mandate,  the Administration ofPalestine, &quot; while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections  of the population are not prejudiced &quot;, is required to&quot; facilitate Jewish immigration  under  suitable  conditions &quot;.Beyond this, the extent to  which Jewish immigration into Pales-tine is to be permitted  is nowhere defined in the Mandate.  Butin the Command Paper of 1922* it was  laid down that for the fulfilment of the policy of  establishing a Jewish National Home    &quot; it  is necessary that the  Jewish community in Palestine    should be able to increase  its  numbers by  immigration.    This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed    whatever  may be  the economic capacity of the country at    the time to absorb new  arrivals.  It is essential to ensure    that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people    of Palestine  as a whole, and that they should not deprive    any  section of the present population of their employment.&apos;&apos;  In practice,  from that  date onwards until recent times, theeconomic absorptive capacity of the country has been treatedas the sole limiting factor, and in the letter which.Mr. ramsay macdonald,  as  Prime   Minister,   sent  to  Dr.  Weizmannfin  February  1931  it  was laid down  as  a matter  of ,policy that  economic  absorptive   capacity   would  be  the&apos;, sole            * Cmd. 1700.            -f Hansard, Vol. 248, 13/2/31, Cols. 751-7;
criterion.  This interpretation has been supported by resolutions of the Permanent Mandates  Commission.   But His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not read either the Statement of Policy of 1922or the letter of 1931 as implying that the Mandate requires them,for all time and in all circumstances, to  facilitate the  immi-gration of Jews into Palestine subject only to consideration  ofthe country&apos;s economic absorptive capacity.  Nor do they findanything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish national home in  Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration  is allowed, to continue indefinitely.&apos; If immigration has an adverse effect bri the economic positipri in the country, it should clearly be restricted; arid equally, if.it has a seriously  damaging  effecton  the political position in the country,  that is a factor that should not be ignored.   Although it would be difficult to contend that the large  number of  Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have riot been absorbed economically, the fearof the Arabs that this  influx will continue indefinitely  until theJewish population is in a  position to  dominate them  has pro-duced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine.   Thelamentable disturbances of the  past  three years are  only thelatest and most  sustained manifestation  of this intense  Arab&quot;apprehension.    The  methods  employed  by  Arab   terroristsagainst fellow-Arabs and Jews  alike must  receive unqualifiedcondemnation.   But there  can be no denying how widespreadamongst the general Arab population is fear.of indefinite jewish immigration,  and that  this feejing has made  possible disturb-ances which have given a serious setback to.economic progress,depleted  the  Palestine  exchequer, rendered life  and  propertyinsecure,., and  produced a bitterness between the  Arab and jewish  populations which is  deplorable  between citizens  ofthe same  country.  If in  these  circumstances immigration  is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country,regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between thetwo peoples will  be perpetuated, and. the  situation in  Palestinemay become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoplesin the Near and Middle. East,  His Majesty&apos;s Government can-not take the view that either their obligations under the Mandate,or considerations of common sense and justice, require  that theyshould ignore these circumstances in framing immigration policy.  13! In the view of  the  Royal Commission,  the  associationof. the policy of the Balfour Declaration with the Mandate systemimplied the belief that  Arab hostility to the former would sooner or later be overcome.   It has been the hope of British. Govern-ments ever  since the  Balfour Declaration  was issued that  intime  the Arab, population, recognizing  the advantages  to  be derived from Jewish settlement and  development in Palestine,
would become  reconciled to  the further growth of the JewishNational Home.  This hope has not been fulfilled.  The alterna-tives before His Majesty&apos;s Government are either (i) to seek to expand the Jewish National Home indefinitely by immigration;against the  strongly expressed will of the Arab people of thecountry; or (ii) to permit any further expansion of the JewishNational Home by immigration  only if the Arabs are preparedto consent  to  it.   The  former policy  means rule by  force.Apart  from other considerations,  such  a  policy seems  toHis Majesty&apos;s Government to be contrary to the whole spiritof Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, as wellas to their  specific obligations  to the Arabs in the PalestineMandate.  Moreover, the relations between the Arabs and theJews  in Palestine must be based  sooner or later on mutualtolerance and goodwill; the peace, security and progress of theJewish  National Home itself  requires  this.  Therefore  HisMajesty&apos;s Government, after earnest consideration, and taking into  account the extent to which  the  growth  of  the  JewishNational Home has been facilitated over the  last twenty years,have decided that the  time has  come to adopt in principle thesecond of the alternatives referred to above.  14.  It has been urged that all further Jewish immigration into palestine should be  stopped forthwith.   But  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment believe that any such sudden  reversal of policy would damage  the whole of the financial and economic systemof Palestine and thus affect adversely the interests of Arabs  and Jews alike.  In their view it would also be unjust to the JewishNational Home to stop further immigration abruptly and with-out giving the Jewish community a reasonable period to adaptitself to the new conditions.   But, above all, they are conscious of the present  unhappy  plight of large numbers of Jews whoseek a refuge from certain European countries, and they believethat Palestine can and should make a further contribution to thesolution  of  this  pressing  world  problem.   In  all  thesecircumstances,  they believe that  they will be acting consistently with their Mandatory obligations to both Arabs and Jews, andin the manner best calculated to  serve the interests of the wholepeople  of  Palestine,  by  adopting  the  following proposals regarding immigration:         (1) Jewish immigration during the next  five years  will    be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity per-    mits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately    one-third of the total  population of the country.  Taking    into account the  expected  natural  increase of the Arab    and  Jewish  populations,  and  the  number  of illegal    Jewish   immigrants  now   in  the   country,   this  would    entail the  admission of  some 75,000 immigrants over the
 &apos; .V next five -years.  These immigrants would, subject always   . to  the  criterion  of economic  absorptive  capacity,  . be    admitted as follows:           (a) In each of the next five years a maximum quota      :  of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed.        .  (6) In addition, as a contribution towards the solution        of the  Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be        admitted as soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied        that adequate  provision  for their  maintenance is        ensured, special consideration being given to refugee        children and dependants.      (2) The  existing  machinery  for ascertaining economic    absorptive  capacity  will be retained, and the High  Com-    missioner will have the ultimate responsibility  for deciding    the limits  of economic capacity.   Before  each periodic    decision is  taken,  Jewish and Arab representatives  will    be  consulted.      (3) After the period of five years  no further Jewish    immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine    are prepared to acquiesce in it.      (4) His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to  check    illegal immigration,  and  further preventive measures  are    being adopted  and will be strictly enforced.  The numbers    of  any  Jewish,  illegal immigrants  who,  despite  these    measures,  may succeed in coming into  the country  and    cannot be deported will  be deducted from the yearly quotas,                        III. Land.  15. The Administration of Palestine is required, under Article6 of the Mandate, &quot;while ensuring that the rights  and positionof other. sections  of  the  population are  not prejudiced &quot;, toencourage  &quot; close settlement by  Jews  on the land &quot;, and no restriction has  been imposed  hitherto on the  transfer of land from Arabs to Jews. The Reports of several expert Commissionshave indicated that owing  to the natural growth  of the arab population and  the steady sale in recent years of Arab land toJews, there  is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land whilst in some other areas such transfers of landmust be restricted,  if Arab cultivators are to  maintain theirexisting standard of life and a considerable landless Arab  popu-lation is not soon to be created.   In these circumstances, theHigh Commissioner will be given general  powers to prohibitand regulate transfers of land.   He will be instructed  to fixareas in which  transfer is to be permitted freely,  regulated orprohibited, in the light of the findings of the Royal Commissionand the Partition  Commission.   These powers  will be  made
retrospective to the date of publication of this statement of policyand the High Commissioner will retain them throughout the transitional period.  16. The policy  of the Government will be  directed  towardsthe  development  of  the land  and  the improvement, where possible, of methods of cultivation.  In the light of such develop-ment it will be  open to the. High Commissioner, should he besatisfied that the &quot; rights and position &quot; of the Arab population will be duly preserved,  to review and modify any orders passedrelating to the prohibition or restriction of the transfer of land.  17. In  framing these proposals His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave sincerely endeavoured to act in strict accordance with theobligations under the Mandate to both the Jews and the Arabs.The somewhat  vague phrases employed in some instances to describe these obligations have often led to controversy as totheir exact significance and make the task of true interpretationdifficult.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that, whenthe immigration over five years which is now contemplated hastaken place, they will have no further obligation to facilitate theestablishment of  the  Jewish  National  Home  by permittingimmigration regardless of the wishes of the Arab population.They cannot hope  to  satisfy  the  partisans  of one  party or  the   other  in  such  controversy   as  the  Mandate  has aroused.   Their  purpose   is  to be  just  as  between  thetwo peoples  in Palestine  whose destinies  in &apos; that  country have  been  touched by the  Mandate, and  who, since  theyare to live side by side in Palestine,  must learn to  practisetolerance, good-will and co-operation, if they are to enjoy peace and prosperity.  In looking to the future His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are not blind to the fact that some events of the past makethe task difficult.  Without the co-operation of  both parties itcannot  be  achieved;   with their co-operation  it can.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government  still  hope for this  co-operation in theinterests of the happiness of the whole people of Palestine.(16379-&quot;) Wt. 3635-4258)  *5, 100, 100 4/39  P. St. G. 335
