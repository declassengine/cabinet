SECRET.CP.  92 (39).                                            COPY NO. 4 ^                            CABINET.                       PRICE INSURANCE FOR SHEEP.            Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.   In CP. 88 (39) the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, with the concurrence of the Secretary ofState for Scotland, submits for decision the proposal that under the projected Price Insurance scheme forsheep the guaranteed price should be lOd. a pound.2.   The Trade and Agriculture Committee were unable to endorse this proposal, and I have felt unable to assent to it in subsequent discussion with the Ministers forthe Agriculture Departments.3.   I am very reluctant to maintain resistance to aproposal which is pressed with persistence and earnest-ness by a colleague beset, as I recognise, with great difficulties, and the cabinet will wish to have beforethem a statement of the reasons and considerations that support my view of the matter.4.   The Interdepartmental Committee on Price Insurance,in their Interim Report - A.P. 37(17): paragraphs 11-20,considered the principles by which the determination of price insurance levels should be governed, and recommendedthat the price to be guaranteed should not be a remunera-tive price, or a price related to costs of production;  but*(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OP  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).
n 9L2 wshould he fixed at such a level as would &quot;insure farmersagainst falls in prices of particular commodities of a kind which, if continued, would eventually involve them in serious financial difficulties, o . . . &quot; .5.   This principle is a basic and vital element of theprice insurance policy on which we have embarked.   I havebeen able to assent to that policy only with reluctance,and I should have felt the greatest difficulty in agreeing to a policy involving any higher level of price insurance.I have emphasised the importance of this principle in successive discussions of the question with my colleagues,and have understood them&quot;to agree with my views that itwould not be possible to justify an arrangement under whichthe farmer would be assured a remunerative price, or evena normal or average price, for each of his commoditiesseparately, and that the price to be guaranteed was to bea minimum price, below the normal price, designed to protect the producers against the consequences of a continuation ofabnormally low prices.6.   A guaranteed price of lOd. a pound for sheep does notin my view accord with this principle,   lOd. a pound is infact the average price realised for sheep over the past6 years.   The average annual prices have been as follows:          1933              9d.          1934             lOvrd,          1935             lOg-d.          1936             lO^d.          1937             11-i-d.          1938              8fd.                   Average lOd.
The sheep population fell in 1934, remained stationary in 1935and 1936, and rose rapidly in 1937 and 1938,   It will probablyfall in 1939 under the wholesome corrective influence in theprice drop of 1938.     These facts point to a guaranteed price of about 8-gd.  asbeing required to accord with the principle by which the policyis agreed to be governed, and suggest that to guarantee a priceas high as lOd. will be to court the danger of an expansion insheep production.   The consequences of such an expansion,  whichmight well be formidable and disastrous, are set out in paragraph33 of the memorandum dated 10th March by the Ministers for theAgricultural Departments (fA. C. (36) 58),7.   The same paragraph of the Ministers&apos; memorandum points todangerous consequences that would ensue &quot;if assistance to the sheep industry were given on a scale that would encourage produc-tion beyond the amount which the market can absorb at normalprices&quot;, viz. that &quot;market prices would fall and the Exchequerliability would rise not only by reason of the increased volumeof production, but in consequence of the widening gap betweenthe standard price and the market price.   In short, the policy would be creating the very difficulty which it was designed to remedy.  There would also be a danger of the scheme - intendedto afford financial assistance only in times of unduly low prices  - developing into a permanent subsidy&quot;.8.   It is unnecessary for me in view of these warnings by theMinisters for Agriculture to labour the unwisdom of guaranteeinga price for sheep that would be likely to encourage the uneconomicproduction of sheep.   Apart from the general considerationsagainst such a course, which underlie the warnings referred toin the  previous paragraph, there are particular reasons for avoiding it, related to inter Imperial trade, which the Secretaryof State for the Dominions will no doubt develop.
9.     It appears to me that the facts of the past six years alone suggest that a guaranteed price oflOd. a pound will involve a serious risk of uneconomicproduction;  hut this view is reinforced by a consi-deration of the probable course of sheep prices in thefuture.    The long term trend in sheep population and prices, the expectation of a decline in the demand forwool, and the increasingly effective competition of imported mutton and lamb with the home product, allpoint strongly to a reduction in the price of sheepin the United Kingdom market, and there is good reasonfor expecting a fall to an average price of less than9d. a pound during the next sheep population cycle,which is now beginning. s If this expectation is realised the effect of a guaranteed price of lOd. will be to&quot;encourage production beyond the amount which the marketcan absorb at normal prices&quot; - with the deplorableconsequences which have already been indicated.10.     I am therefore of opinion that a guaranteed price of 8-g-d. is indicated as being about right and aprice of lOd. as too high, if we are to conform to theessential principle to which we have agreed, and toavoid giving encouragerrent to uneconomic production.I am fortified in this opinion by the following passage in the report by the Interdepartmental Committee on price Insurance, dated 5th April, of their specialexamination of this question following the failure ofthe Trade and Agriculture Committee to reach agreement:
            &quot;The representatives on the Committee     of the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the     Dominions Office consider that an appropriate     standard price would he one which averaged 8-j?0     or at any rate not more than 9d3 over the year.     The representatives of the Agricultural Departments     consider that 3?0 would he definitely too low,     and that a figure lower than 9^0 might not achieve     the object and would undoubtedly give rise to     political difficulties if proposed,,s!        It is obvious, as indeed the Committee pointout, that it is impossible to determine with precisionwhat particular level of guaranteed price would safe-guard the industry against undue losses withoutencouraging undue expansion,,   In such a matter, however,it is wise to err, if in doubt, on the side of caution.11.     There is another consideration in favour ofguaranteeing a price on the low rather than on the highside in the case of sheep0   It appears that it is for adminsitrative reasons an essential condition of anyprice insurance scheme for sheep that the subsidy should be paid in respect of individual sheep within a defined group on a basis which assumes that all the sheep within the group are of the same weight (viz.the assumed average weight of the group),  although infact the weights of the individual sheep will varyover a wide rangeD   The effect of this arrangement will be to encourage a progressive reduction in the weights of sheep produced.   This may in the long runprove to be of advantage;   but there will always be atendency for the average actual weight of sheep earningsubsidy to be less than the assumed average weight ofthe group, and in consequence for the whole group of                   -5-7
sheep to be subsidised as if their total weight werehigher  than it actually is0   This tendency may be capable of periodical correction in administration butthere will always be a lago   To the extent that thetendency is realised, sheep as a whole will in fact be receiving subsidy on the basis of a higher price perpound than the guaranteed price, and it might well bethat the &quot;real&quot; price produced in this way would be substantially above the stated guaranteed price.   Theexistence of this &quot;concealed margin&quot; in any guaranteed price affords ground for not making the initialguaranteed price too high0   A further reason is thatthe balance of advantage likely to result from any scheme for reviewing the standard price from time to-time will almost certainly be in favour of the farmerand against the Exchequer012o    I do not fail to realise that the conclusion to which I invite the Cabinet to come is unwelcome tothe Ministers for Agriculture, and that its adoptionwill not render their difficult task any easierD   Itwas to be expected from the outset,  however, that the farmers&apos; ideas of price guarantees were different fromours, and that they were unlikely to be satisfied  by insurance levels fixed by reference to the principle which we have deliberately9 and for very good reasons,adoptedo   In. the case of oats and &quot;barley we are already committed by the existing statutory position toguaranteeing prices at levels above those which strictconformity with the principle would require, and if we now decide to guarantee sheep prices at the level
suggested the principle will in my opinion he completelyand irrevocably prejudiced, and we shall be embarking on a policy of maintaining uneconomic agricultural production by means of permanent Exchequer subsidies *-I believe this to be an impossible policy forthis country, and it is in my view essential toavoid it whatever political difficulties may haveto be facedo(Intld.)J.S.TreasuryChambers, S.W.I.24thApril, 1939.
