(Signed)  S.E.  BRIDGES.                               Secretary  to the Cabinet.Richmond  Terrace,  S.W.1.    25th  April,  1939.
                                                   1 * Q          The Cabinet Committee on Compulsory MilitaryTraining, at a Meeting held on Monday, 24th April, 1939,decided that a Meeting of the following Ministers --    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster                                    (in the Chair),    The Lord Privy Seal,    The First Lord of the Admiralty,    The Secretary of State for War,    The Secretary of State for Air,    The Minister of Labour,       together with their Advisers and       Parliamentary Counsel -should be held to determine the year&apos;s age group to beincluded in the Military Training Bill, and other outstanding points in the Military Training Bill and the mobilisation of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill.          The conclusions reached at this Meeting were as follows              MILITARY TRAINING.BILL.   (1)  Age group to be Included in the Bill.        The best age group to be included in the Bill        is 20 to 21c-   On the whole, this age group        is likely to cause least immediate disturbance,        more particularly in regard to the recruitment        for the Regular Forces cf the Crown ,  the        apprentices engaged in munitions production        and also in regard to agricultural workers0   (2)  Inclusion of a provision allowing individuals        to apply to be called up either earlier or        later than the normal jagji, groupa        It would be desirable to include a provision to        this effecto   The provision should be drawn in        general terms, so as to give the responsible        Minister wide discretion to make regulations to        meet difficulties likel^r to arise in regard to        those industrial undertakings employed on        rearmament work which employ a large number of        engineering apprentices0
(3)  Exemptions.     (a)  A provision should be included for     exemption of conscientious objectors?  subject     to persons so exempted undertaking to  carry     out work of national importance.   The provision     of exemption on these lines will necessitate     the establishment of tribunalso     (b)  The question was considered whether it     would be necessary to grant exemptions to,     for example, medical studentsc   The importance     of not interfering with the completion of     training in these cases was appreciated, but it     was felt that the wisest plan would be to rely     on such cases being dealt with under the     provisions referred to in (2) above in regard to     postponement of calling up0(4)  Failure to answer the general calling up notice.     It should be appreciated that unless and until     some system of National Registration has been     established, there will be no machinery to enable     defaulters to be identified and called up for     training.   For the time being, at any rate, the     only course is to insert in the Bill a general     obligation on persons within  the  specified age     group to come up when called upon, and  to rely     upon public opinion.   The establishment of     machinery at a later date would enable     defaulters to be identified..   The point should     also be borne in mind that in certain areas     there might be an attempt to  organise wholesale     evasion of  the obligations iin.deit  the Acto
(5)  Machinery for calling  up.     The question was  considered whether  it     would now be necessary to  establish  a     separate Ministry of National  Service     charged with the  duties of calling up     persons un^er the Bill, and of conducting     the Medical  Boards and Tribunals.          The general  view  of the Meeting was     that it was  most  desirable that existing     machinery should  be used for this  purpose,     and that the only available machinery     was that of  the Employment Exchanges.          It was  further agreed that the  Department     responsible  for the calling up procedure     must carry through the subsequent  stages of     Medical Boards and Tribunals,  and  that it     would lead to disorganisation  if some     Ministry, other  than the Ministry  of Labour,     were to be authorised  to use the machinery     of the Employment Exchanges.- 3 -
(6)   Allocation &quot;between the three Defence Services      of men called up under the scheme.                The position of the Admiralty and the Air      Ministry is that they would wish to take a limited      number of men of this age group, who are willing      to undertake not less than six months&apos;  continuous      training in their auxiliary forces.                The procedure would be that the      Department responsible for calling up men would      allocate volunteers for this service in so far as      vacancies existed.(7)   The status of men called up under the Military      Training Bill and allocated to the auxiliary forces      of the Admiralty and Air Ministry.                The War Office propose that persons      called up under the Military Training Bill should,      during their period of continuous training, receive      a lower rate of pay than Regular soldiers and      Territorials.                Should the same procedure apply to      persons called up under the Military Training Bill      and allocated to the auxiliary forces of the      Admiralty and Air Ministry?  The point is of some      importance, Since the Air Ministry, in particular,      are anxious to preserve the principle that their      forces are manned by volunteers only.                It was provisionally agreed that, in order      to retain the status of volunteers (and to receive the same      pay as volunteers^persons called Up under the Military      Training Bill and allocated to the auxiliary forces      of the Navy and Royal Air Force must undertake a      continuous period of training in excess of six      months.   It was agreed, however, that this point      might require further investigation.
 (8)    Men called up under the Compulsory Military Training       Bill and allocated to the Army.                 The Secretary of State  for War said  that       he proposed that,  on completion  of the  six months&apos;       continuous training, these men should be given an       option of joining  the Territorial Army  or the       Supplementary Reserve.   This plan would retain the       principle that the Territorial Army was a voluntary       Force. (9).   Conditions of service during the  six months&apos;       continuous training.                 It was suggested that  the rate of pay       should not be less than l/- a day, and  that       special arrangements would have  to be made for       dependants and hard cases.  It was desirable that       the outline of the terms proposed should he settled       b efore the announcement was made  on Wednesday.       This involves consultation with  the Treasury.(10)    Reinstatement in civil occupations.                 The view was held that  it-would he       desirable to insert a Clause in  the Bill that  any       employer should be under an obligation  to reinstate            (a) a Reservist or member of the Auxiliary                Forces on  the completion of his period                of service if called up  under  the                Mobilisation of the Reserve and                Auxiliary Forces Bill;            (b) a man on  completion of  his six months&apos;                continuous military training under the                Military  Training Bill;       and that if he failed to do so he should he called       upon to show reason.  This would-hjavaljrea.the-       establishment of some form of Tribunal.(ll)    Application to Ireland.                 It was agreed that the Bill should apply       to Northern Ireland.  In regard  to persons of Sire       origin, living for  the time being in this country,       it was decided to  obtain the views of the Secretary       of State for Dominion Affairs,                           -5-
    MOBILISATION OF RESERVE AND AUXILIARY             FORCES BILL.          THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR raised aquestion whether it was advisable to proceed withthe Mobilisation of Reserve and Auxiliary ForcesBill in its present form.  He expressed the viewthat to do so would be in violation of the contract made with Reservists and members of the auxiliary Forces.  He said that two other courses were open to the Government:-   (l)  to declare a State of Emergency;   (2)  to put into operation a plan which he had        elaborated for a greatly accelerated        deployment of the Air Defence of Great        Britain.          THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thathe would like to see in detail the plan referred toin (2) above before expressing an opinion.          THE CHAIRMAN said that as one of the con-siderations involved in the Secretary of State forWar&apos;s proposal was the advisability of now declaringa State of Emergency, this was a matter outsidethe purview of the Committee.
