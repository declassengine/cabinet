 people  of Palestine  an  increasing part  in the government of  their  country, the objective being to place Palestinians  in charge of all the  Departments of Government, with the assistance of  British advisers and subject to the  control  of the High Commissioner.   With this object  in view  His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared  immediately to arrange that Palestinians shall be placed in charge  of certain Departments, the British heads  of those Departments being retained as advisers.   The Palestinian heads of Departments will sit on the  Executive  Council,  which advises the High Commissioner.   Arab and Jewish representatives will be invited to serve as heads of Departments approximately in proportion to  their  respective populations. The  number of Palestinians in charge of departments will be  increased as  circumstances permit until all heads of Departments arePalestinians,  exercising the administrative and  advisory functions which are  at presentperformed by British officials.    When that stage is leached consideration will be given tothe  question of converting the  Executive Councilinto a Council of Ministers with  a consequentialchange in the status  and functions of  the palestinian heads of  Departments.&quot;                             Sub-paragraph (5)

In framing these proposals His Majesty&apos;s                            Government have sincerely endeavoured to                            act in strict  accordance with their                            obligations  under the Mandate to both the                            Arabs and the  Jews,   The vagueness of the                            phrases employed in  some instances to .                            describe these obligations have led to                            controversy  and have made the task of                            interpretation difficult.   His Majestj^s                            Government cannot hope to satisfy the                            partisans of one party or the other in                            such  controversy as  the Mandate has                            aroused.   Their purpose is  to be just as                            between  the  two peoples in Palestine whose                            destinies in that country have been                            affected by  the Mandate, and who, since                            they  are to  live side by side, must learn                            to practice  mutual tolerance, goodwill and                            cooperation.   In looking to the future.                            His Majesty&apos;s  Government are not blind to                            the fact that  some events of the past make                            the task of  creating these relations                            difficult,0   but they are encouraged by the                            knowledge that at many times and in many                            places in Palestine  during recent years                            the Arab and Jewish  inhabitants have lived                            in friendship  together.   Each community
has much to contribute to the welfare oftheir common land, and each must earnestlydesire peace in which to assist to theutmost of their capacity in increasing thewell-being of  the whole people of thecountry.   The responsibility which  falls on them, no less  than upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to cooperate together to ensurepeace is all the  more solemn because theircountry  is one which is revered by many millions ofvMoslems, Jews  and Christiansthroughout the world who pray for peace inPalestine  and  for the happiness  of herpeople.&quot;
