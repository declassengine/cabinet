The         Cabinet will be aware of the serious situation in the sheep         industry frcm the memorandum on the regulation of imports         of mutton and lamb (CP.286 X38)) which was considered by         the Cabinet on 14th December last (Cabinet 59 (38)         Conclusion 11).   As a result of the conclusions         subsequently reached by the Committee on Agricultural Policy         (A.P.(37) 7th Meeting - 14th December, 1938) imports of         mutton and lamb are now regulated by Order of the Board         of Trade.   It is clear, however, that regulation of         imports alone is insufficient to safeguard sheep farmers         from the severe depressions that appear to recur every six         or seven years and that some system of price insurance is         essential.   A provisional plan has been prepared by an         Inter-Departmental Committee and its main lines have been         discussed and agreed generally with the representatives of         the Farmers5  Unions.    The salient features are as follows:-             (a)  The scheme would provide for a deficiency payment                  from the Exchequer on sheep presented for sale                  for slaughter which reached a certain qualifying                  minimum weight.
0  (b)   The payment would &quot;be the difference between a        standard price for fat sheep and an ascertained        average market price for all breeds of sheep and        would be payable in respect of a standard weight,        irrespective of the individual weights of particular        sheep.   payments would be made monthly on the basis        of average monthly market prices.  (c)   Separate standard weights and minimum qualifying        weights would be fixed for (i) pure mountain breeds        (the lighter animals)  and (ii) ether breeds and        crossbreds.  (d)   Ewes and rams would be ineligible.  (e)   There should be a limit or &quot;ceiling&quot; to the number        of sheep receiving full rate of subsids?-, for which a        population of 27 millions has been tentatively        suggested sted.2.        These proposals were discussed at a meeting ofthe Trade and Agriculture Committee of the Cabinet on14th March (T.A.C.- (36) 19th Meeting), but the Committeefailed to reach any conclusion upon the important questionof the standard price, nor has it proved possible, as theCommittee suggested, for the Chancellor of the exchequer to reach agreement on the subject with the Secretary ofState for Scotland and myself, in the course of a subsequent discussion that we have had with him.3.        The Farmers&apos; Unions asked for a guaranteed price of1/- per lb., but this figure is too high as it would have in-volved payment of subsidy in every month of the last six years,except for two months of very high prices in 1937.   The annual average prices of first and second quality fat sheep and the sheep populations in Great Britain in the past seven years
were as follows:-Tear	Price in pence	Sheep Population	per lb.	millions.1932	8	26.41933	9	25.91934	ioi	24.21935		24.21936	.ioi	24.21937	: ui	24.71933	8t	25. 7In the five years prior to 1932 prices were appreciably higherand averaged about 12d.  per lb.4.        It is undoubtedly the case that prices in 1932 and 1938,and to a slightly less extent in 1933, led to serious lossesamong sheep producers and the trend of the sheep population insucceeding years confirms this view.  The effect of changes in theprice levels upon the sheep population tames from 12 to 18 months to materialise and it will be observed that recovery after thedecline caused by low prices in 1932 did not show itself until1937 and did not become marked until 1958, when it was augmentedby an exceptionally favourable lambing season.5.        It is unfortunately not possible to say with precisionwhat standard price would safeguard the industry against unduelosses without encouraging undue expansion.  I am satisfied,however, that in the light of past experience and taking intoaccount the subsequent rise in costs of production since theperiod 1934-6 when prices averaging lChjd. to 10-g-d. per lb. had little effect -by way of expansion of the sheep population, theappropriate figure should be lOd. per lb.6.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the other hand,takes the view that, in order to protect producers againstthe consequences of abnormally low prices and to avoidundue expansion in numbers of sheep, 8^d. per lb.  wouldbe about the right figure.   He fears that any higher
U Jfigure might lead to an increase in the sheep populationinvolving a large additional charge on the Exchequer fromwhich the farmer would obtain very little additional benefit.7.         The following table sets out the number of months in which subsidy would have been payable during the past7 years on the basis of annual standard prices varying from10d. to 8-gd.. per lb.Standard	Number	of months in	which subsidy	payablePrice				84rd.	10do		9d.	1932	12	12	12	101933	12	11	6	1934	3	1	-	-1935	3			-1936	4	2	-	-1937	-		-	-1938	10	9	9	7Total-	44	35	27	17           It will be noticed that at lOd. subsidy would havebeen payable only in 44 out of 84 months, in the seven year period.   The Exchequer liability in 1932, when prices were very low and the sheep population in the U.K. was atthe same level as the proposed &quot;ceiling&quot;, would have been 3,800,000 at lOd. per lb. and  1,000,000 at 8^d. per lb.,while  in 1933 the liability would have been  2,500,000 and 300,000 respectively.8.         I am convinced that it would be economicallyunjustifiable and would lead to great political difficultiesif we  were to submit to Parliament and to the farming industry a. price insurance scheme based on an annual  standard price aslow as 8-g-d. per lb.  With due regard to  the principle that price  insurance is designed to safeguard  the farmer againstundue  loss and not to  ensure that his costs  ofproduction will be fully covered, I consider that lOd. per lb.. is the appropriate figure and that with  the presentprospects of no reduction in general price levels and costs in the next few years  there would be no  appreciable risk
          of embarrassing expansion nor  of undue  liability on the          Exchequer.   It  is  contemplated that,  as with other price          insurance  schemes,  the  standard price should be subject to          review at  suitable intervals and to variation  in the light          of changing  circumstances.  Even with a figure of lOd. there          will  inevitably be a  feeling of disquiet  among sheep farmers,          which it will require considerable persuasion  to allay,          especially among those  in certain parts of Great Britain where          sheep are the mainstay  and -practical^  the sole cash crop          of the farming  enterprise.          9.        For a number  of reasons which I need not set out          in  detail we  clearly  cannot contemplate a sufficiently          drastic restriction of  imports  of mutton  and lamb to maintain          a  satisfactory  level  of prices  for the  home producer and I          would therefore urge  my colleagues to adopt the alternative          of  price insurance  at such a level as will prevent sheep          producers from  reducing their  flocks through fear of a          recurrence of the  heavy losses  of last  year and yet will          not cause an  undue  burden on&quot;the Exchequer.  Any such          reduction would be in  conflict with the Governments land          fertility policy in which sheep are a key product and would         be deplorable from  the  aspect of national defence.    we          cannot  I suggest run  the  risk of such dissatisfaction with          our proposals as led  to the withdrawal  of the Milk Industry          Bill  last autumn and  for  these reasons  I would urge my          colleagues to accept  a  standard price of lOd.  per lb.          10.       The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs in          the views expressed,  and  the recommendation put forward,          in this Memorandum.                                              R.H..D-S.nistry of Agriculture  and Fisheries. 20th April, 1939.
