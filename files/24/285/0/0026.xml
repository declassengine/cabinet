EXPANSION OF FOOD PRODUCTION IN TIME OF WAR              Memorandum by the     Minister of Agriculture arid Fisheries                    At  a meeting of the  C.I.D.  Sub-Committee  on          Food  Supply in Time  of War held  on the  18th April last          it was  agreed in  principle  (F.S.  9th Meeting Conclusions          (I)(e))  that  certain further  steps should be  taken  to          Improve  the food  position of  this  country in  time of  war.          The details of such  measures were  subsequently examined by an          Inter-departmental Committee,  and  in  the light of this          examination I  am  circulating herewith for the  information          of my colleagues  the draft of  a  statement which I propose          with  their concurrence  to make in  the House of Commons          after questions on Wednesday next,  3rd May.    The terms of          the statement  have been approved &quot;by the Treasury, but the          Secretary of State for Scotland would prefer to reserve his          position as he is not yet satisfied that in all respects the          proposals are  suitable  to conditions  in Scotland.                   I regret that I  have &quot;been unable to  give longer          notice of this matter, &quot;but  as my colleagues will appreciate,          it is essential that an announcement should be made          immediately if any action on the lines proposed is to be taken          this  summer.                                             R.H.

                   DRAFT AN1T0UNCBMENTEXPANSION OF POOD PRODUCTION IN TIME OP WAR          Under the Government&apos;s general plans for ensuringfood supplies in time of war the function allotted to theAgricultural Departments is that of making the arrangements thatwould he required in the event of an outbreak of war to bringabout an expansion of food production in this country.          Plans have accordingly been prepared for a central and local organisation which would be responsible for giving effect to arrangements for increasing the production of food and feedingstuffs.   The Agricultural Departments would beresponsible for the central direction and Executive committees would be set up in each county to whom important functions would be delegated.    I am circulating in the Official Reportthe names of the gentlemen whose services the Government hasbeen able to secure as Chairmen-designate of these prospectiveCommittees in England and Wales.          An expansion of home food production would necessarily involved an increase in the arable area obtained by means of aploughing-up campaign.   The particular crops,  the productionof which we whould have to expand, would depend on a number of circumstances including the season of the year when an outbreak of war occurred, the situation in regard to foodreserves in this country, and overseas supplies, and the suitability of the newly ploughed land for particular crops,whether for human consumption or for feedingstuffs for ourlivestock which provide vital supplies of milk and meat.          A great deal of information has been collected by my Department and prepared in a form in which it would be immediately available for the proposed Executive Commit Lees.
          A  reserve  of  fertilisers  has  been  secured, and plans have been made  to  organise  and control  the supply anddistribution of fertilisers,  feedingstuffs,  machinery,  fuel,implements,  seeds  and other farm  requisites  for  the  industry&apos;swar-time requirements.          The problem of  labour has been carefully consideredwith the other  Departments  concerned.   In addition  to  the safeguards provided  under the scheme of reserved occupationssteps are being taken to  enrol persons  willing to undertake work on the  land in  time  of war,  and plans have  been made fortraining by  intensive courses, in the event  of a war, thosewho have had. little  or  no previous  agricultural  experience.This matter  is  now receiving  further consideration in the lightof recent Government decisions.          The-Government  do not consider it  necessary or desirable that  the plans  for  production on the scale or of thecharacter that  would be required  in time of  war  should  be putinto operation  in  advance of  an outbreak of  war.   They considerthat the best preparation for an  emergency is to bring  theland into a  state  of greater  fertility  which would enable it to respond more  fully to the increased demands  which would he made&apos;on it in the  event of an  outbreak of war.    The  government therefore desire that farmers should make a  special effort this summer to improve  their poorer grassland, large  areas of whichcould not in  its present  condition  yield satisfactory crops.          To  assist farmers to improve  the potentialproductivity  of  such land the Government propose to ask parliament to authorise the payment of  contributions of  2 per acre in respect  of permanent  grass  ploughed  up after this announcement  and before 30th  September, 1939, and brought into astate of cleanliness and  fertility  by fallowing, re-seeding orsowing to an approved crop.   The objective  would be to prepare                          2.
                                                            9 f&quot; o                                                            C-J &apos;J o                                                            Off)the land for sowing next autumn or spring, if the need arises,such crops as might he required to supplement supplies offood or feedingstuffs.   If the need does not arise asubstantial area of worn out grass land will have been converted into more productive pasture,          I would urge farmers, in consultation where necessary with the landowners concerned, to make arrangements to plough up during the summer  inferior permanent grasslandthat would benefit by re-seeding and could, if necessary, beput in a condition to produce suitable crops.   Notice of intention to plough up must be given to the agricultural departments in England and Wales, Scotland and NorthernIreland, in order that the land concerned may be inspectedat the discretion of the Departments, either before or afterploughing.   For the purposes of this scheme, permanentgrassland will be regarded as land under grass that has beendown to grass for not less than seven years.   Applicants willbe required to satisfy the Departments that this condition hasbeen fulfilled..   No payment will be made in respect of areasof less than two acres, and fractions of less than half anacre will be disreg. .rded.          Further details and particulars of the form in which notice of intention to plough up should he given  will beissued at an early date.          The necessary legislation will Tee introduced as soonas possible, and it is contemplated that payment of theGovernment contributions would be made in the autumn, subjectto the Departments being satisfied that the work has been duly carried out and that any necessary safeguards or conditions have been observed.          The Government are confident that they will have thefullest support and co-operation of the agricultural community inthis effort to improve the productive capacity of our soil,
