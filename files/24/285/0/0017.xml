COMMITTEE  ON FOREIGN POLICY,                     MILITARY  VALUE OF  RUSSIA.             REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF  STAFF SUB-committee                               INTRODUCTION.            1.     At  their  43rd Meeting on the  19th April,  1959&apos;f the            Foreign Policy Comi&apos;committee  agreed,  inter alia,  to  request            the Chiefs of Staff  to prepare,  as a matter  of urgency,            an appreciation  of Russia&apos;s military strength.,    They            suggested that this  appreciation should not  take  the            form of a review of  the military  arguments for and against            accepting the Russian proposal, hut that it  should rather            confine itself to estimating,  from whatever  information            might already be in  the possession of  the Chiefs  of            Staff, the present military value and -capacity for            performance of the Soviet Army, Navy and Air Force,.            2.      We preface our Report with three general remarks,            which are applicable to all three of the Russian  Services.            3.      Firstly,  there is little doubt  that the Russian            Services have suffered as the  result of  the recent  purge,,            The institution of political control into the Services            has resulted in effect in dual control.   The inherent            desire of the Russian to  shirk responsibility is  given            full scope  under  this system and has resulted in  discipline            which was  formerly  good,  being now of an indifferent            standard.    Furthermore,  it  had directly resulted in  the            disappearance of  the few  experienced Commanders in  the  U.S.S.R.                     x   P.P.

4.     Secondly the numerical total of the armed forces ofRussia is to some extent misleading.  On paper, thesefigures appear formidable but the almost insurmountabledifficulties of maintaining these large forces in thefield, owing to inadequate reserves and inferiorcommunications,must not be overlooked.  We elaboratethis point later in our Report.5.     Thirdly,  although this is perhaps not strictlywithin our terms of reference, we wish to draw attentionto the fact, that the various countries in which wevisualise in this Report that Russian forces might beused, may be themselves most unwilling   to admit of the entry of Russians into their territory, though this maynot apply with the same force to air forces which canbe more easily segregated,. In this connection we under-stand that the Russians themselves are disinclined tuallow their own forces to operate from a country wherethey may become liable to bourgeois influence.   This deep-seated hostility to Communism and vice versa may wellnullify  the value of many of the Military advantages-we..put forward in support ef Russian co-operation.6.     We turn now to examine the problem from the pointof view of each of the three . Services in turn.                  TH^ RUSSIAN NAVY.Baltic Sea.7.     The strength of the Russian Fleet in the Balticand in the Gulf of Bothnia is a follows:-       Baltic Fleet (baased on Kronstadt).             2 battleships;             1 cruiser;             3 light cruisers;             15 large destroyers;             16 small destroyers;             55 submarines;              1 cruiser mine-layer.                      -2-
1 P. r;8.     Tixe individual ship efficiency of this fleet is good hut organization and staff work are very poor.The Submarine Arm is believed to be the most efficientbranch.9.    &apos; We summarise the value which we might hope toobtain from Russian Naval co-operation in the Balticas follows:-       (a) The Russian Fleet would contain             considerable numbers of enemy naval             forces and thus relieve our ITavy of             some of its responsibilities in             respect of the German Fleet.       (b) The Russians would be in a position             to interrupt to sone extent  the  supply             of Swedish  iron ore to Germany.       (c) Wc should be .assured of the use of             Russian Naval ports in the Baltic             should we over decide to despatch             any of our own Naval forces to thatBlack Sea.10.    In the Black Sea the Russian Naval strength isas follows:-                 1 battleship;                 2 cruisers;                 4 light cruisers;                14 large destroyers;                11 small destroyers;                48 submarines;                 1 aircraft tender.11.    This force would suffice to ensure the superiority of the Soviet Fleet over any likely combination of enemy forces in the Black Sea.   In the event of Rumanianparticipation  this might enable certain Russiansupport to Rumania to bo maintained by sea;  but this,as wc point out 1 .tor on,  is subjcet to otherlimitations.
Far  East.12.      The  strength of  the Russian Fleet  in the far east, which  is based cn  Vladivostok,  is as follows:-                    2 light cruisers;                    2  large desticyers;                    9 small destroyers;                    a large number of  submarines.13.      Vl/9 consider that the presence of  a RussianFleet of this  size  in  the Far East &apos;would  be an  addeddeterrent to Japan  from  uniertaking the alreadyhazardous operation of a large  scale  military  expeditionagainst-Australia,  New-Zealand,  or Singapore.               THE  RUSSIAN ARMY.Western Front,14.      We estimate thgt Russia can mobilise on theWestern frontier in the  course  of the first three  monthsof war  -             30  Cavalry  Divisions             100  Infantry Divisions,15.      The  equipment  of this army  is more noteworthyfor  its quantity rather  than  for its  quality.    It isstill largely  on a  horsed basis.    The Russian  tanks  ofwhich we estimate  there  are  some 9,000  in all,  however.are  of  a high  quality  though  lightly  armoured  forany  attack against  modern highly organised anti-tanfedasfence16.      The  fire power of Russian artillery is  low,only 36 equipments  being allotted to  each divisionalartillery, but it  is understood that  an increase is taking  place.    Many of  the weapons too are of  an  oldpattern or have  recently been converted.    Very few,  withthe  exception  -.f their anti-aircraft  guns are of moderndesign.17.      The  Russian ^rmy in narticular has suffered fromthe  purge in 1937  and  from the  political  control of theCommissar system.   Its  value,  especially for offensive operations,  has  thus been much  reduced.                    -4-
i p.nJL U  18.    We have mentioned the fact that Russiancommunications are in a deplorable condition.   Thereare five single and one double railway lines leading fromRussia to Poland.   Rolling stock and engines on theserailways are poor, and we understand that from 30 to 60per cent, are usually undergoing repair at the same time.19.    There is, moreover, a break of gauge at thePolish frontier and a complete absence of any form of organisation to meet the  reception and maintenance ofany Russian forces operating on or beyond the Russianwestern frontier.20.    In the same way the roads on the western frontierare inadequate  and indifferent and the absence of sufficientmechanical transport rules out the possibility of any considerable  Russian military forces  being efficiently maintained  by road. 21.    We conclude,  therefore, that anysubstantial Russian  military support  to  Poland is  out  of the question, 22.    The  possibilities  of  support  to Rumania  are not much more promising,  since no appreciable  Russian forces could be maintained in that  country by land.   Nor could they be  maintained by oca route  owing to the fact that the Russian Merc intile Marine is inadequate.    Moreover, even if substantial forces  could be shipped to Roumania their further maintenance would bo dependent&apos; upon Roumanian ^railways which arc indifferent.    The further the force ad.var.ccd from the coast,  the greater would bo its difficulties.
C Qv 0 23.     The Russian Army  could,  and in view of the anxiety of the  Soviets  for the security of Leningrad probably would, resist  any attempt by Germany to overrun the Baltic  States. 24.     Even  if  the war ?/ent  so  badly for the Allies  as to result  in Poland and Roumania being overrun the Russians would still  contain  very substantial German forces on the Eastern front. 25.     We should perhaps draw attention to the very grave.: military dangers inherent in. the possibility of any agreement between Germany and Russia, 26.     The feasibility of Russian support to Turkey would, in our  opinion,  be limited in the same way by the extent to which the effort  could be maintained by the Russian mercantile marine.-, Far East. 27.     We estimate that  Russian could mobilise in the Far East approximately -        5 Cavalry Divisions.      32 Infantry Divisions,, 28.     This  force is reported to be in possession of reserves for the first six months of a war,  with the exception of petroleum supplies of which they are short  and which are dependent  upon seaborne trade by Vladivostok. 29.     This  force would  at jleast exercise a  containing influence on Japan in Manchulcuo and China, particularly  in support  of the Chinese 8th Route Army.                   THE RUSSIAN  AIR.FORCE.Western Front.30.    In addition to a large number  of obsolete  aircraftallotted in  Army  formations and Naval Commands specifically
                                                          1-69for direct co-operation with the land and sea forces we estimate that the Russians have an air force of 1,000 bombers and 900 fighters west of Lake Baikal.31.    Of the bombers 500 are heavy  cypes which are largelyobsolete and unlikely to be used in  an offensive  capacity.  Theother 500 are medium bombers of reasonable performance whichcould very well have some effect on  the general situation.They could for instance:-       (a) From Warsaw reach the general line Berlin-Leipzig -             Prague.       (b) From Roumania reach the general line Vienna -             Flume  (and of course would cover the whole of             Hungary)*       (c) From Turkey reach Sofia and the Dodecanese (and             of course cover Bulgaria).32.    The fighters are of reasonable performance but theirradius of action is more limited than the bombers&apos; andshould they be used as escorts to the bombers the radius of the latter would correspondingly  be reduced.   Russianfighters might also form a valuable  supplement to the air defence of Poland.33.    The maintenance of a large proportion of the more efficient Russian bombers either in  Poland or Roumania orTurkey could possibly be arranged by using obsolete heavy bombers as transport machines.   The provision of adequatequantities of fuel and bombs, especially the former, would however constitute a serious problem.34.    The Russian aircraft industry is based  round Moscow and towardsthe Urals and for reasons of the lack of organising ability,indifferent internal organisation, and irregularity ofsupply of essential material, we consider it-unlikely thatany increase of production in war will be possible.
35.     We conclude that the value of the Russian airforces west of Baikal consists in:-       (a) The possibility of the production of a             limited threat from aircraft based in             Poland, Roumania or Turkey.       (b) Their ability to contain on the western             frontier more German air defence units than             would otherwise be allotted for that purpose,       (c) The possibility of assistance to the Polish             air defences.Far East.36..    We estimate that the Russian air forces east of lake Baikal consist of some 1,000 aircraft comprisingin approximately equal proportion, bombers, fighters and reconnaissance types.   This force is economicallyindependent of Western Russia, and is provided with atleast  six months&apos; reserves on a peace footing, includingpetroleum.   The general  level of their efficiency wereckon to be equal  to,  if not better than, theJapanese.   A number  of heavy type bombers in  this  force,although obsolete,  can  reach Tokyo, a threat which weunderstand the Japanese consider with some trepidation.37.    The presence  of  this Russian air  force  in theFar East would have  a restraining  influence onthe Japanese, would contain  some Japanese  air  forces,and might afford valuable assistance to  China.
                   THE ECONOMIC ASPECT,CCc    We have discussed the large number of Divisionsw..ieh the Soviet can put into the field at the outset ofwar.   We would, however, dm-aw attention to thefact that although Soviet industry was planned to havean immediate output sufficient to maintain in the fieldat least 100 Divisions from the outset of war, and afar greater capacity in the event of full industrialmobilization, the great new factories built withforeign help and the plant in them have been allowed to deteriorate;  insufficient skilled labour is availableto increase output in emergency above the normal rate;administration is hopelessly inefficient and has beenmade worse by the purges which still continue.   Forthese reasons and above all on account of the present state of the railways, we consider it doubtful whetherthe national economy of the Soviet could deliver warstores at a greater rate than would suffice to keepin the field on the Western Front 30 Divisions,39,    We have drawn attention also to the indifferentstate of the internal communications in Russia.   Therailways are working to capacity and are incapable of taking any extra strain.   tthile they could play their part in the mobilization of the Army in the first fewweeks of war, industry and other essential services wouldbe more or less at a standstill.   After two or threeweeks Military mobilization would have to be suspended,or at least held up,to avoid a complete breakdown in industry and national life.
1r;       A few weeks after the outbreak of war,  the SovietGovernment would be faced with the fact that therailway capacity might suffice to carry essential warstores to the Armies on the Western Front, but only at the expense of a considerable fall in the productionof war material.40B    It has been suggested that the Soviet mightsupply armaments to other allied countries.   We would point out, however,, without unduly stressing the point,that Turkey alone uses Soviet types of armaments in any considerable degree.   There is little doubt that soviet Industry would be unable to switch over to themanufacture of types of such armaments as might berequired by say Poland or Roumania.41.    In the preceding paragraphs we have shownthat the positive assistance, whether it be inthe shape of military support, or of supplying warmaterial, which Russia could afford to Roumania, Poland,or Turkey, is not so great  as might be generally supposed,On the other hand,Russian cc-operation would be invaluablein&quot;that Germany would &quot;be unable to draw upon Russia&apos;simmense reserves of food and ran materials, and should therefore succumb mWre quickly to our economic strangleholds
               SUMMARY.42.     We-summarise the Military value of the russian forces as follows:-        (a) The Russian Navy in the Baltic would:-                 (i) Contain considerable German Naval                       strength.                (iij Interfere with the Supply to Germany                       of Swedish iron ore.               (iii) Provide ports in the Baltic for our                       use if required.        (b) The Russian Navy in the Par East would:-                     Be an aaded deterrent to Japan from                       undertaking, any large scale                       operations against Australia,                       New Zealand, or Singapore.        (c) The Russian Army in the West:-                 (i) Would not be in a position to afford                       material support to Poland.                (ii) Would not be in a position to maintain                       in Roumania or in Turkey any Military                       effort of a size which would have a                       material effect on the situation.               (iii) is likely to resist a German advance                       through the Baltic States.                (iv) would contain substantial German forces                       in the East in the event of Poland                       and Roumania being overrun.        (d) The Russian Army in the Far East;-                     Would exercise a containing influence                       on Japan and might be of some                       assistance to China.        (e) The Russian Air Force in the West could:-                 (i) Produce a limited threat against Germany                       and Italy from advanced air bases in                       Poland, Roumania, or Turkey if                       these countries consented to air-                       craft operating from their                       territories.                (ii) Contain on the German Eastern Frontier                       more German air defence units than                       would otherwise be allotted for                       that purpose.               (iii) Be of some assistance in strengthening                       the air defences of Polando
(f)  The Russian Air Forces East  of Baikal  would      have a restraining influence on the  Japanese      contain some  Japanese air  forces and might      afford valuable  assistance to China.(g)  Russia could not assist us or our allies  to      any considerable extent by the supply of war      material, but her co-operation would be      invaluable in denying Russian sources of raw      material to Germany,(Signed) C.L.N.
