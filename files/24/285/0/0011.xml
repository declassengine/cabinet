the Committee met to consider the points raised inthe discussion at the meeting of the Cabinet onApril I9thc,  1939, and had before them the Memorandum(CP. 79 (39)) by the Secretary of State for theColonies covering the draft of the proposed command paper on Policy in Palestine, and also certaintelegrams  (Paper P0(33) 25) recently exchanged between the Secretary of State and the High Commissionerfor Palestine.that there were three main questions for consideration which were inter-connected, but which could conven-(l)  What attitude should be adopted towards    three points which had been raised by the    Representatives of the neighbouring Arab    States on the proposals communicated to the    Egyptian Ambassador in London which were con-    tained in the Foreign Office Telegram to Sir    Miles Lampson, l\Oo 274 of April 6th.(2)  Future procedure in regard to the publication    of the Command Paper and other matters;  and(3)  The question of the publication of a Statement    about an amnesty for political offenders with    special reference to the future position of    the Mufti.THE SECRETARY OF STATE F!OR THE COLONIES saidientlybe taken one by one.These questions wereThe Committee agreed to consider thesequestions in turn.
The- Reply Of         THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR THE COLONIES drew the Arab states to the Proposals ..attention--tO&apos;Telegram No. 249 of 11th.  April fromin Telegram                  Sir Miles Lampson, copies of which were handed round                  at the Meeting.  For the text of this Telegram see                  Appendix I to these Conclusions.                     As would he seen from this telegram the Represent-                  atives of the Arab States (but not of the Palestinian                  Arabs) had authorised the Egyptian Prime Minister to                  reply as follows to the proposals in Telegram No.274:-                     (a) The Arab States agreed to the proposal in                  paragraph 1.    It would be remembered that this                                              soon                  proposal contemplated that as/as peace and order had                  been sufficiently restored, Palestinians would be                  placed in charge of certain,Departments, the British                  Heads of these Departments being retained as Advisers.                   The proposal also contemplated the gradual increase                  in the number of Palestinians in charge of Departments                  and an ultimate stage when consideration would be                  given to the question of converting the Executive                  Council into a Council of Ministers with a consequent                  change in the status and functions of the Palestinian                  Heads of Departments.                         It was now for decision whether we should                  definitely confirm this proposal.   On the assumption                  that the Committee would agree to this course it was                  proposed to substitute for sub-paragraph (4) of                  paragraph 10 of the draft Command Paper a new sub-                  paragraph, copies of which were then handed round at                  the Meeting and the text of which reads as follows :-                     &quot;(4) As soon as peace and order have been                          sufficiently restored in Palestine steps                          will be taken to carry out this policy                          of giving the people of Palestine an                          increasing part in the government of                          their country, the objective being to                          place Palestinians in charge of all the
            Departments of Government, with the            assistance of British advisers and            subject to the control of the High            Commissioner..  With this object in            view His Majesty&apos;s Government will be            prepared immediately to arrange that            Palestinians shall be placed in charge            ef certain Departmentsf the British            heads of those Departments being re-            taimed as advisers.  The Palestinian            heads of Departments will sit on the            Executive Council, which advises the            High Commissioner,  Arab and Jewish            representatives will be invited to            serve as heads of Departments approx-            imately in proportion to their respective            populationso  The number of Palestinians            in charge of Departments will be increased            as circumstances permit until all heads            of Departments are Palestinians, exercising            the administrative and advisory functions            which are at present performed by British            officials,.   When that stage is reached            consideration will be given to the question            of converting the Executive Council into, a            Cc.uhcl.1 of Ministers with a consequential .            change in the status and functions of the            Palestinian heads of Departments,11.The Secretary of State added that he did not ask the Committeeto settle the final text of the Command Paper.  This text,which in any case would need some revision, could be examined during the week-end and a revised text submittedeither to the jommittee or to the Cabinet in the course ofthe following weeko       The Committee agreed to recommend the Cabinet to confirm the proposal set out in (l) of Telegram Eo. 274 ofApril 6th.  to Cairo, and to authorise the substitution of anew sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 10 of the Command paper on the lines quoted above for paragraph 10 (4) of the printed texte       (To) The Arab States cannot accept the. idea of a federal State and desire that reference to this possibilitybe omitted from paragraph II (i) of Telegram No0  274.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES reminded theCommittee that paragraph 10 (l) of the draft Command Paperstated that &apos;:the objective of His Majesty&apos;s Government isthe establishment within 10 years of an independent PalestineState, possibly of a federal nature,  in such Treaty
                                                      Q9relations with Great Britain as will provide.....It would he remembered that every proposal that  we have put forward had included a reference to the possibilityof a federal solution.    Not only was this attractive tothe views but it was the view of the Secretary of Statethat a federal solution of some kind would ultimately befound to be the only possible solution.   If now,  in deference to Arab wishes, we deleted this reference tofederalism from the Command Paper, the Jews would be certain to notice the alteration, they would be  muchupset, and they would ask whe.th.er this really meant thata federal solution was in future to be ruled out from consideration.  He (the Secretary of State) had  put these difficulties to the Egyptian Ambassador, who had repliedthat the Representatives of the Arab States took strongexception to the presence in the Command Paper of thewords &quot;possibly of a federal nature&quot; but that tney wouldnot regard the omission of these words from the  command paper as ruling out, for all time, the possibility of a federal solution.     The Secretary&quot; of State had replied that even if itwas decided to omit this expression from the command paper, it would be impossible for us to avoidreference to the matter in the Parliamentary Debates, orto our expressing our view that a federal solution might ultimately be found to be the best solution.     In view of the vital importance of reaching an agree-ment with the Representatives of the .arab States, theSecretary of State suggested that the words &quot;possibly ofa federal nature&quot; should be omitted from paragraph 10 (*1)Of the Command Paper, and that references to the subject should be left to be made in the Parliamentary Debates.
If this suggestion was accepted^  he proposed to informthe Egyptian Ambassador accordingly.,     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that the reference to a federal solution was not very appropriate in a passage designed to emphasise the establishment indue course of an independent Palestine State and defining the external relations of that State-   He did not objectto the suggested omission of the words provided that wereserved our rights to expound, our point of view freelyin the Parliamentary Debates.     In reply to questions, THE SECRETARY 01&apos;&apos; STATS FORTHE COLONIES explained that by federalism was contem-plated a central administration for the whole of Palestinewith considerable powers of self-government for the twoor more Provinces into which the country might be divided.He also agreed that the expression might oover an evenwider field and, if agreement could be reached, thearrangement might include neighbouring Arab States, likeTransjordania.   There was no doubt that the Jews attached great importance to the possibility of a federal solution;that the neighbouring Arab States were not much concerned,but that the Palestinian Arabs were anxious for the deletion of the reference because they detested the ideaof partition in any form and saw in these words thepossibility that we might, in some way, revive partition.He thought that there was something in the argument ofthe Egyptian Ambassador that if the inclusion of these words was likely to increase the ill feeling between theJews ahd the Arabs it would be better to delete them fromthe Command paper     The Committee agreed to recommend the Cabinet that thewords &quot;possibly of a federal riRture&quot; in paragraph 10 (l)of the Command Paper should be deleted, but that we should keep a free hand to make clear our point of view on thesubject in the Parliamentary Debates..
     The third point made by the representatives of theArab States was mentioned in telegram Ho.  249  asfollows:     &quot;(c) They point out that under paragraph  2          His Majesty&apos;s G-overnment reserve to          themselves the right to prolong the          period of 10 years after consultation          v/ith the Arab States and the League          of Hationsc   The Arab States wish          it to be understood that the period          will not exceed 10 years except with their          consent (apart altogether from what          the Palestine Arabs may want.)&quot;     THE SECRETARY OP STATE I^OR THE COLONIES said thatthe Committee would remember that v/e had reserved ourposition in our telegram Ho. 274 in the following     &quot;(2) His Majest3r&apos;s Government will do  everything          in their power to create conditions  which          will enable  the independent Palestine  State          to come into being within ten years.    If,          contrary to  their hope,  they are  forced to          the conclusion at the end of that period          that conditions in Palestine do not  render          it practicable to set up an independent          State,  they  reserve the  right to  postpone          its establishment until  such time, as  soon          afterwards as possible,  as conditions  are          created which make it practicable.   Before          deciding on  such postponement, His Majesty&apos;s          Government will consult  the Council  of the          League  of Nations and the neighbouring Arab          States.          In seeking an answer to  this question  the          British Government do not commit  themselves          to modifying in any respect the proposals          which have been submitted to the  Arab          Delegations  nor do they  contemplate  a  continua-          tion of discussions at long range with the          Arab Delegations.  They  feel, however,  that          definite information on  the specific point          raised above will be of  assistance to  them          in formulating their policy.&quot;     The Egyptian Prime Minister had taken  very  strong objection to this proposal and as  would be  seen  wished usto agree not to postpone the coming into being of theindependent Palestine  State beyond the period,  of tenyears, unless the Arab States agreed to such postponement-
In adopting this attitude,  the Egyptian Prime minister was not aware tnit the formula Quoted above from our telegram no0 274 had been agreed in London with therepresentatives of the Arab States0   He (the Secretary ofState) thought that we ought not to agree to thisparticular proposal,,   The  Committee would be well aware of the very important reasons which had caused us to reach the decision that we must retain a free hand to decide onthe expiration of the 10 years whether the circumstance were such as would then justify the establishment of anindependent Palestine State,,   Our reply might be thatthis formula represented agreement reached in London and thatwe could not consent to modify the substance of thatagreement6   We might, however, in order to save the face of the Egyptian. Prime Minister, suggest an alterationof wording which would be little more than a dressing upof the idea of consultation.   The Foreign Office and theColonial Office had to this end prepared the followingrevised version&quot;of sub-paragraph 8 of paragraph 10:   &quot;8* His Majesty&apos;s Government will do everything    in their power to create conditions which will    enable the independent  Palestine State to come    into being within ten years.   If, at the end of    ten years, it appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government    that,  contrary to their hope, circumstances make it    impossible to set up the independent Palestine    State forthwith, they will consult with    representatives of the  people of Palestine, the    Council of the League of Nations and the    neighbouring Arab States regarding the situation,    and invite their co-operation in framing plans for    the future with a view  to achieving the desired    objective at the earliest possible date.&quot;     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out and theSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed that the new draft did not in fact answer the question of what was to happen if at the expiration of the 10 years period, HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the other parties failed to reach agreement.
                                                       y to     TIE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOFSIGIT AFFAIRS pointedout on the other hand that the new formula in no way-fettered our implicit right to act as we night think fitafter the consultations had taken place0     THE PRIME MINISTER observed that under paragraph 10(8)as now drafted, the point was not left open to any doubt.     &quot;If, contrary to their hope, they are forced      to the conclusion at the end of that period      that conditions in Palestine do not render      it practicable to set up an independent State,      they reserve the right to postpone its      establishment until such time, as soon after-      wards as possible, as conditions are created      which make it practicable,.&quot;     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thathe himself thought, and his views in this respect wereshared by his expert advisers, that if we took a firmline and insisted on the maintenance of the formula as agreed in London, we should carry our point.   TheCommittee were informed that in a recent telegram from cairo we had been told that while the Egyptian PrimeMinister was adamant on the point, the Emir Feisal had stated that he would not depart from anything that he had agreed to in London,     TIT1 PRIME MINISTER thought that the revised draft wouldbe more satisfactory if in line 8 we inserted the worols&apos;before taking any decision&apos; after the words  &apos;they will&apos;,and he invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies toascertain whether in the opinion of his expert advisers, theinclusion of these word.s would in fact give us the rightof final decisioiio     THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointed outthat one possible cause of postponement might be thatwe had not then attained a satisfactory treat^r withPalestineo
     SIR GRATTAN BUSHE thought that the answer to the    ^ *Prime Minister&apos;s enquiry was in the affirmative,       THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we could not he toocareful in the language we now used.  Moreover, it mustbe remembered that the English text would have to betranslated into Arabic B  Many of our present difficultiesin regard to Palestine were due to ambiguouslanguage having been used in the past and he would verymuch regret if those whose responsibility it would be todeal with the matter in 10 years&apos; time found themselves in similar difficulties owing to our having used languagewhich was open to misunderstandings0       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS favoured the substitution of the new paragraph and hoped that theSecretary of State for the Colonies was right in the view which he took of what the Egyptian Ambassador in Londonreally thought about the point.  Perhaps it would be wise before finally committing ourselves to the revised draft, that the Secretary of State should show it to theEgyptian Ambassador and invite his comments upon ito                     xIn a recent telegram,  Sir Miles Lampson had stronglystressed the importance of our doing everything possible tosettle quickly with the Arabso  He (the Secretary of State)recognised the importance of these arguments, and at thesame time fully appreciated the difficulty of pledgingourselves now to some definite action in 10 years&apos; time whenthe circumstances might be altogether different.  Soconvinced was he of the need for reaching agreement that he:-would be prepared to give the Arabs what they wanted, rely-ing on our being able  in some way or other to get out ofour pledge if necessary when the time cameo       &apos;&apos;       ay-                  Telegram Noo 214 cf ^drd toarcho                        -9--

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FORE I GIT AFFAIRS said thathe had been told by Lord Lloyd, who had conferred with anumber of distinguished Moslems?  that in their view therewas no need for us to engage in propaganda among the Moslemsin regard to Albania? and that the one and. only source of trouble between the Moslems and ourselves was this Palestineproblemo     THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR THE COLONIES agreed that palestine was the one big issue between the Moslem world and ourselves,,   The Egyptian Ambassador had expressed the viewthat the situation vis-a-vis the Arabs had been changedgreatly by the Albanian affair and that we might look for an improved atmosphere in the next few months.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA expressed the opinionthat now was the moment to meet the Arabs as far as wecould possibly do soB
       THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEasked what were the circumstances against which we might have to guard in ten years&apos; time.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat the. circumstances were that a satisfactory treatymight not have been made, that the internal situationin Palestine might he greatly disturbed, or that we might be engaged in some far,       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER observed thatwe also wanted to keep some inducement on the Arabsto settle with the Jews.       THE SECRETARY X)F STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that our desiderata would be obtained and thepoints of view of the Arabs and the Jews met if wecould insert after the words &apos;if it appears to his majesty&apos;s Government&apos;  some such words as Tin spite ofa satisfactory treaty having been made&apos;0       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES did not favour this proposal.       THE PRIME MINISTER hoped, very much that we shouldnot now tie ourselves up rigidly to a time-table.He would be very reluctant to our entering into a firm commitment ten years hence when we knew nothing whateverabout the circumstances which would obtain when the commitment had to be implemented.   He suggested thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies should, as soonas possible, see the Egyptian Ambassador and ascertain
Ms reactions to the new formula.       THE COMMITTEE agreed to this suggestion.       THE PRIME MINISTER referred to paragraph 3 of telegram No. 249 to Cairo reporting that the EgyptianPrime Minister had said that tranquillity could be restored at once in Palestine if immigration werestopped forthwith for a definite period.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES explainedthat Sir Miles Lampson had set out his views on palestine in Telegram No. 214 of March 25rd.   Ourcomments on this Telegram were contained in TelegramNo. 275 of 7th April.   Among Sir Miles Lampson&apos;suggestions were proposals that we should negotiate a purely temporary settlement involving the abandonment of the contemplated constitutional changes, and atemporary suspension of Jewish immigration, although we should make it clear that it was our ultimateintention to allow the Jewish population of palestine to rise to one third of the total population.   Theobjections and difficulties of this solution were setout in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Telegram No. 275.The Secretary of State added that the Egyptian PrimeMinister had stated that if we could meet the arab states on points (b) and (c) in Telegram No. 249 he was confident that he could get the rebellion in Palestinecalled off.
       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA doubted thefeasability of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s suggestion for atemporary suspension of Jewish immigration.    In hisopinion the&apos; trouble would only be intensified whenimmigration came to be resumed.       THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Committee thata suspension of immigration had not been included inour proposals to the Egyptian Ambassador.    Our mainconcession had been that which related to the placingforthwith of Palestinians in charge of certaindepartmentse       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thoughtthat it was possible that on the receipt of our latest proposals the Egyptian Prime Minister might findhimself in a position to approach the Mufti and his supporters with a view to the calling off of the rebellion in Palestine.
                                                          I \j &amp;PROCEDURE.               THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES was                    afraid that he must now ask his colleagues to considerChoice betweenimmediate action    the important question whether the Government shouldand postponinga decision.         forthwith take and announce their decision (which                    might or might not he a decision agreed with the  Arab                    side) or whether the Palestine question should be                    deliberately shelved for a time.                         He would state first what seemed to him to be                    the arguments which told in favour of                    postponement.   These were- (a) the possibility that                    our imposed solution,while pacifying the                    Arabs, might drive the Palestinian Jews into revolt,                    with the result that the Government would have to use                    force against them,   There were many people who  would                    regard such a situation as unthinkable.   The arguments                    for this view were brought out in a telegram from                    Dr. Weizmann to the Prime Minister despatched from                    Jerusalem on April 18th.   This telegram read as                    follows:-                              &quot;On my return Palestine found Jewish                         community united resolute determination                         oppose with all its strength contemplated                         new policy.

Adoption these proposals regarded tantamount                         to establishment Jewish Ghetto in small                         corner of country.   Jews are determined                         make supreme sacrifice rather than submit to                         such regime.

It will also engender further     bitterness between Jews and Arabs and drive Jews     who have nothing to lose anywhere to counsels of     despair.  Appeal to you in name of justice and of     peace of Holy Land not to disregard advice     offered with full knowledge of facts and out of     deep anxiety for all concernedo&quot;     (b) The very considerable opposition which the white paper proposals would arouse in the House of Commons, ata moment when the international situation demanded thatthe House should show the greatest possible degree ofunity.   The proposals would cause a split of opinion inevery party, including the Conservative Party;  broadly speaking the Labour and Liberal Oppositions would bebitter opponents of the scheme,,     (c) The opposition to which the White Paper wouldgive rise in the United States,at a time when it was morethan ever desirable that American opinion should be with us.     (d) The possibility of war in the near future.  &apos; Ifthis occurred it was very likely indeed that palestine would be one of the theatres of war,  so that,  whether we wished it or not, Jewish immigration would come to as top immediately.   A great war would in any event render the whole plan out of date,     (e) One must admit, to be  quite honest, that theGovernment scheme in its latest form included certain features which would not have been there if we had been allowed to give our undivided  attention to devising thebest plan for the future good  government of Palestine.Telegram No. 408 of April 11th showed that the HighCommissioner felt this very keenly.   This situation was of course due to our having incorporated in the scheme,to placate the Arabs; certain  features as to which we
                                                         ledourselves.were not convinced on merits.    It was arguable that after a period of postponement the  whole sky mighthave cleared and we might be able with the agreement ofthe Arabs to work out a scheme less open to criticism.     The arguments in favour of an immediate decision might be put as follows:-   (i) So long as we allowed theexisting uncertainty in Palestine to continue we shouldhave perpetual trouble from both Arabs and Jews.   We hadno policy at present and the sooner we had one the better.There was a fair prospect that matters would graduallysettle down after we had announced our decision.   (ii)The disappointment which postponement would occasion amongthe Arab States of the Near East, whom it was essential tohave on our side if the International situation shoulddeteriorate into war.   (iii) In spite of what he had saidunder (e) above, the policy of the White Paper was, heventured to say, wise and  just in essentials.  It was hightime for us to set a limit to the more extravagant inter-interpretations of the Balfour Declaration.     Mr. MacDonald said that the conclusion of  the whole matter, so far as his judgment went, was that the arguments in favour of immediate action were much the more powerful.It would be elementary prudence to do nothing until a fewdays after Herr Hitler&apos;s  speech on April 28th,  in  view ofthe possibility that this speech might cause a  deterioration in the international situation.   Apart from this, however,Mr. MacDonald was in favour of announcing the Government!policy at the earliest possible date.     THE MINISTER FOR  CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE  thought the strategical aspect of  the matter might fairly be summed upby saying that  if war  were to break out no  trouble that  theJews could occasion us, in Palestine  or elsewhere,  could
weigh for a moment against the importance -of-JBdJCUii&amp;g.. Eoslemopinion to our side, &quot;both in the Arab countries and inIndia,     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES was inclined to think that any had feeling which our decision might cause in the United States would probably not last morethan a few months.   He would be glad to hear whether theForeign Secretary concurred in this estimate.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thaton the whole and with some hesitation he would agree.  Hehad once or twice asked the American Ambassador in london for his view on this point, and the Ambassador had saidthat we ought not tc over-estimate Jewish influence  inthe United States,     Lord Halifax.said that he was less disturbed by the thought of the possible re/ction among the i-unericans thanby the anticipated reactions among the Jews.   He wishedhe knew how bad those reactions would be.;   If they werenot too serious he would be in favour of going ahead atonce, as the Colonial Secretary proposed,     THE HOME SECRETARY thought that Dr. &quot;Vei zmann&apos; telegram was an expression of complete opposition to our plan, not a request for its postponement0     THE PRIME MINISTER said that when he had last seenhim Dr. Weizmann had distinctly asked for a six monthspostponement,     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that hisown estimate of the trouble to be anticipated from the palestinian Jews was that  it would be very  serious for aperiod,   Dr. Weizmann would no doubt try to exercise amoderating influence, but  the situation would be beyond                                             Palestinianhis control.   It would be only natural that the/Jews should
be in a desperate frame of mind,   Our statement of policy would have dashed to the ground the hopes on which theyhad been building for many years past.   Moderate andextreme Jews alike would join in the outcry.     He thought, however, that after two or three months the agitation among the Palestinian Jews would die down,,     This consideration, therefore, need not deter us                                      urgentlyfrom going ahead.   Other considerations/demanded thatwe should do so,   Vve could not go on as we were.   Thesolution of partition had been tried in vain,   At the back of the whole problem was the fact that the pledgeswhich were given to the Arabs and Jews during the last war were fundamentally irreconcilable,     THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were now compelledto consider the Palestine problem mainly from the pointof view of its effects on the international situation,                                             had it was of immense importance, as Lord Chat fields/pointed out,to have the Moslem world with us,   If we must offend one side, let us offend the Jews rather than the Arabs.     He agreed also with what the Colonial  Secretary had said as to prudence demanding that we should not make any announcement until after April 28th,   Accordingly, he was prepared to accept the Colonial Secretary&apos;s recommendation,                     t imesubject to our having/to give   further consideration toour announcement after Herr Hitler&apos;s speech.     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that on balancehe agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.   Theinternational situation was the governing factor.
Question of              THE HOME SECRETARY said that he also agreed,handing over aBritish colony      He would like., however, to add a plea that we shouldto the Jews.                    hand over a whole colony to the Jews for settlement                    purposes.   It was not at all the same thing to give                    them the opportunity of settlement spread over five                    or six colonies.   The most obvious possibilities                    were British Guiana and British Honduras.                         Some discussion of this suggestion followed, and                    the view was expressed that we might even be prepared                    to contemplate allowing an existing British colony                    to become a Jewish sovereign state.   This, of course,                    would give rise to many nationalitjr questions.   It                    would also mean that the Jewish state would maintain                    Ambassadors and Ministers abroad^                         The question was also discussed whether in the                    event of its being found possible to offer a colony                    to the Jews the announcement should be made simultaneously-                    eously with the announcement of policy on Palestine                    or a little later, e,g, in the course of a debate in                    the House of Commons,                         The Committee also discussed  the position regard-                    ing the  inquiries which had already taken place as to                    the suitability of British Guiana  for Jewish settle-                    ment.    The Commission  who  had  investigated the                    matter were now back in Hew York,    It was not known                    whether  their report was going to  &quot;be  favourable or                    unfavourable.   Another factor was  that  the Governor                    of British Guiana, who had so  far  adopted  a helpful                    attitude towards  the scheme for  Jewish  settlement in                    his colony, was now on the way home.
     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he would raise these matters in his discussions with the Governor in the near future.     THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had somepersonal knowledge of British Honduras.   It consistedmainly of forest country, and was now regarded as anunhealthy colony.   It could, of course, he made into a very different place by cutting roads and introducing health services.      british guiana, on the other hand, was a better and a largercountry, and had some mineral wealth.     He hoped that the Colonial Secretary would bring these questions before the Cabinet if any difficultywere experienced with the local Governors or their advisers.          The Secretary of State for the Colonies          undertook to give urgent consideration          to the question of the practicability of          handing over a British colony for Jewish          settlement.Procedure atthe negotiations in Cairo:Question of allowing the mufti to returnto Palestine,     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat the procedure which the Egyptian Prime Ministercontemplated was that, when we had indicated our view on the points which had been referred to London,negotiations should be resumed in Cairo.   This wasalso the view of the representatives of the neigh-bouring Arab States generally.   They contemplated that the Mufti should be summoned from Syria to cairo in order to take part in the negotiations.
        Mr-c  MacDonald said that he felt some hesitation about the prospects which consultation with the  Mufti  would open up. It was certain to  mean protracted negotiations.    There  was no  hope whatever of  the Mufti  agreeing outright  to  our amended proposals,-,  He  would  re-open  everything,  would insist on numerous alternatives being considered  and it might be many weeks  before  we were in a position to announce our policy        In addition it  seemed to  him  that we shoiild not be acting fairly by the Jews if we  agreed to  what ?/as in effect another conference in  Cairo,  at which they  were not represented The  Jews  would criticise us  severely aid with some  reason. They would  say that, having  mad:&apos;  our offer in London,  and having been turned down  by both  sides,  we  had begun running after  the Arabs;   and  that the final result of our efforts had  been our complete sur?ender to  the Arab side.        Further, to  allow  the  Mufti to participate in the Cairo  discussions  would  be to  put him back on his  pedestal in the  eyes of  the  Arab  worldo    If  the Mufti  then came to terms with us,  he would enjoy  a triumphal progress  and sooner  or later he would return  to (Palestine.  All  this was elean  contrary  to  the  strong advice we  had received from theHigh Commissioner  and Cfbneral Haining,  ..ho  had recommended that the Mufti  should never  be allowed  to  return to-Palestine.       The  alternative course, so  far  as the  Cairo  negotiations were concerned, was  to  continue our discussions with the representatives of  the neighbouring Arab States, but notto see the Mufti or other representatives  of the PalestinianArab s.       Mr. MacDonald said  thcxt on the whole  he would not recommend that the negotiations with  the neighbouring States
 should have any fox rial character.    To  give  them such a character would expose  us  to  criticisms hy  the League of Nations and in the United States.    Nor would  it he appropriate if,  as he hoped,  we  reached a satisfactory understanding with the neighbouring  Arab States that this should be enshrined in any formal  signed agreement.        He had discussed all  these  questions of procedure with the Egyptian Ambassador in London  who had adopted a very helpful attitudee        Mr.  MacDonald said he would now  sum up his recommendations  on the question  of  procedure.      (i)  We should telegraph  tonight to the Prime Minister of Egypt to say  that we were  prepared to meet him on two out of the  three points which had  been  referred to London for determination.     (ii)  The  Cabinet should be  invited  to approve the White Paper at  their meeting on Wednesday, 26th April.    (iii)  Our  statement of policy should be made as soon as practicable after the  28th April.   This statement would, of  course,  be  a  unilateral declaration  by the United Kingdom. The neighbouring Arab  States would have no share of responsibility for it  but it would in fact embody our understanding with them.     (iv) As soon as  possible after (iii), the neighbouring Arab  States should issue  a joint statement.   This statement might  be  somewhat to the  effect  thot the British declaration, while  not containing everything for which the PalestinianArabs had contended, gave them a great part of their demands. It  removed  their main fears.    In all the circumstances of the case the rest of the Arab world thought it right to appeal to the Arabs of Palestine to be content with what they
                                                     Hihad gained.   They should put a stop to violence and, ifthey still felt  strongly on any points where  their demandshad not &quot;been met, they should continue their agitation on those points on  constitutional lines.       The Secretary of State said that on the whole he believed that the result, after a short time, wouldbe acquiescence  on the part of the Palestinian arabs and a cessation  of violence0   The Egyptian ambassador was confident that this -programme would bring about a successful  resulto   That of course remained a matterof opinion until our programme had been put to the test.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he was  prepared to agree to this programme *His only serious hesitation was due to the doubtshe felt whether  the present Prime Minister of egypt would remain in  office much longer.       THE PRIME MINISTER asked what course the colonial secretary would recommend in the event of the neighbouring arab States failing to reach agreement with us and decliningto participate in the programme.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thathe was in favour of going ahead, whether the Arab states were with us or not.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that noother course was open to us.   By our statement of theprevious Autumn we had pledged ourselvee, in the eventof the London Conferences not resulting in agreement,to consider the whole matter afresh and to give our ownaward.    Our prestige demanded that we should now do so*Indeed, since we were aboixt to make our award, he  (Sir john simon)   was inclined to say that we ought not to go&apos;

FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatMUFTI-to palestine,.    the Mufti was a here in  the  eyes  of the ,Arab .world and              it was probably not  practical politics  to  say  that he              must  never in any circumstances return  to Palestine,              On the other hand there  were grave  objections  to his              return at the present  juncture.                     THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that he              had a compromise  solution to propose.   His  solution              would be  that after  the  restoration of  law and order the              Arabs who were  now in  exile  from  Palestine  should be              allowed to return by stages0                     (a)  Firstly*  those political  exiles who                           had not  been guilty of  crimes of                           violence,                     (b)  Secondly,  the remaining deportees  and                            exiles c                     (c)  The Mufti  alone  would then  remain  in exile.                           We  could not say  that he  should  never                            return.    For  one thing, when the time                            came for us to surrender  the Mandate,                            it would no longer  be a question -                            for us to  decide.  The Mufti, however,                           must certainly remain away from                           Palestine  for  some  time to come.   He                           was not  to be  trusted and he had                            certainly  been guilty of  organising                            the campaign of violences   Over and                            above  this he  was a.  cause of  feud                            among  the  Arabs themselves. .  He was                            at  the head of the  party  which declined                            to  have  any relation^ with the Nashashibis.                           On the whole,  Mr0 MacDonald thought that we                            ought  to lay it down  that the Mufti should                           not return until  his  feud with the Nashashibi                            party  was  healed  and  no possibility remained                            of it  breaking out  again.  Thus the door                           would  be closed against the Mufti&apos;s return,                           but it would not  be bricked up.
                      At this point the Committee adjourned for a short                 time for a Division in the House of Commons,  and on the                 Committee resuming,  the Minister of Health,  who had                 been unavoidably prevented from attending earlier,                 joined the Meeting..                      The Secretary of State for India did not return                 to the Meeting.Question *f an        THE SECRETARY 0? STATE FOR T, li COLONIES repeatedAmnesty withparticular       the proposals which he had made earlier in the Meetingreference to the mufti.           regarding an amnesty for political offenders and                 as regards the future of the Mufti,                  For these proposals see page 24 above.                      THE PRIME MINISTER enquired how the High Commiss-                 practitioner in Palestine would react to the suggestion that                 the door should be left open for the possible return                 of the Mufti to Palestine after peace and order had                 &quot;been fully re-established and we were satisfied that                 the blood feud between the supporters of the Mufti and                 the other Arabs had ceased and would not be revived.                      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that                 the High Commissioner in Palestine would certainly be                 in favour of our announcing now that the Mufti should                 never return to Palestine,   It was, however, probable                 that he would accept the present proposals which gave                 him 80 per cent, of what he wanted.                      THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that it was.difficult                 for him to express a definite opinion as he had not had                 the the advance.itage of listening to the previous discussion.                 He would regret the making of a statement on the lines                 contemplated by the Secretary of State,  and he would                 very much like to hear the reactions, not only of the
                 High Oomnissioner for Palestine, but  of General Haining.                 Very great credit was due  to  General Haining and the                 troops  in Palestine for the manner  in which they were                 so successfully crushing the  rebellion.   He :                 therefore greatly hoped that  an appreciation from  the                 military point of view on  the new proposals would  be                 obtained.                      THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that under the                 Secretary of State&apos;s proposals the  Mufti would be  kept                 out of Palestine and would only be  allowed  to return                 subject to conditions with which he would probably                 never be able to comply.   The difference in the                 i/iufti&apos;s case     not between  a bolted and an open  door,                 but between a bolted and a built up door.     Moreover,                 it should be remembered if an independent Palestine                 State was created it would not be possible  for  us  to                 make it a condition that the  Mufti  should not then                 return to Palestine.                      THE MINISTER OP HEALTH repeated his desire that                 both General Haining and,, the  High Commissioner  should                 be consulted on the new proposals.                      THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR THE COLONIES  agreed                 and undertook that a telegram should be despatched                 forthwith to the High Commissioner and that the High                 Commissioner should be invited to ascertain and inform                 us, both of his own views  and of those of General                 Haining on the new proposals.The Revision          THE MINISTER OF HEALTH suggested that  the  draftof the DraftCommand Paper.   Command Paper should be revised with a view, where                 possible, to making its language more palatable to the                 Jews.  He also favoured the postponement of the                 publication of the Command Paper until after 28th. April.                                  -26-
The Committee took note(1)  hat the Secretary of State  for the    Colonies would proceed with  the revision    of the draft Command Paper,  and in so doing    would consult with the Minister of Health    with a view, where possible,  to making its    language more palatable to the Jews.(2) That in the absence of any special reason    to the contrary the Committee should not    meet again before Wednesday,  April 26th.,    but that the Palestine question should be    considered at the.Meeting of the Cabinet on    that day and that for this purpose the    Cabinet should have before them the  present    printed draft of the Command Paper    (CP. 79 (39)) and the draft Conclusions of    the present Meeting of the Committee.(3) That the Secretary of State  for the  Colonies    would explain to the Cabinet the various    amendments and alterations which it  was    proposed to make in the text of the  present    proof of the Command Paper circulated with    CP. 79 (39).

                                                                 ill                           APPENDIX.          Decypher.    Sir M.  Lampson (Cairo),                               11th April,  1939.                 D.    7.10 p.m.  11th April,  1939.                 R.    6.20 p.rn.  11th April,  1939.          No.  249.IMMEDIATE.                  My telegrams Nos. 243 and 244.                  Prime Minister informed Mr. Bateman on 9th April          that representatives of neighbouring States (but not of          Palestine Arabs) had met on 8th April and that he was          authorised by them to reply as follows to proposals in your          telegram No. 274.                  (a)  Arab States agree to proposal in paragraph 1.                  (b)  They cannot accept the idea of a federal state          and desire reference to this possibility be omitted from          paragraph 2(l).                  (c)  They point out that under paragraph 2 (two)          His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve to themselves the right to          prolong period of ten years after consultation with Arab          States and League of Nations.   The Arab States wish it to          be understood that period will not exceed ten years except          with their consent (apart altogether from what Palestine          Arabs may want).          2.      Prime Minister said that last paragraph of your          telegram No. 274 wounded Arab representatives and that he          could not understand why it had been added.   He feels that          if agreement of Arab States can be obtained on  (b) and (c)          above they may be able to effect agreement on the whole of          British proposals and probably table  Palestine Arabs with          them.
3.       In answer to a direct question Prime ministers aid that tranquillity could he restored at once in Palestineif immigration were stopped forthwith for a definite period (please see paragraph 2 of your telegram Ho. 275).        Addressed to Foreign Office Ho. 249 of 11th April,repeated to Bagdad Ho. 12 and Jedda No. 9.
