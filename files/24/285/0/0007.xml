[F.C.I. 127.][I.C.F:/148, dated 1.2.39.]ENCLOSURE TO ANNEX.                        GERMAN  AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY.Memorandum prepared  by  the  Industrial Intelligence  Centre  [Department  of        Overseas Trade) in collaboration with the Air Staff (Intelligence).1. Output in June 1938.     Our last report, dated in August 1938, estimated the rate of production  ofthe German aircraft industry at the end of June 1938 to have been :              About  595 airframes  of all  types  per month,             About 1,210 aero-engines per month,on which about 134,750  persons were employed, exclusive of labour engaged  inrepair work or in the production of semi-manufactures and minor components.2. Activity June-December 1938.     It has now been known for some months that orders were given in April andMay last year for a general  speed-up in the output of certain armament stores,including aircraft.   Some weeks  before the September  crisis  these orders had begun to take effect. Additional labour was engaged, and factories,  whose output was reckoned at a low figure six months ago, started on a high rate of production.which, according to an estimate by the French  Air Staff, reached a peak rate  of output  at about the date of  the crisis of  c. 1,000  aircraft of military types per month.     After the crisis was resolved the rate of output  of complete aircraft is believed to have dropped for a few weeks to wellbelow that current before the crisis, andit is believed that this drop resulted  from the depletion  of stocks of componentsduring  the preceding high rate  of output.  But, after the stocks of componentshad been replenished, the rate rose again, though it has not subsequently reachedthe figure attained during the emergency.3. Output January 1939.     Appendices I and II. summarise  the collated information available from all sources regarding the activity of  individual factories.   From these Appendicesit would appear that the monthly rate of output  of the whole industry may  benow estimated as follows :          Airframes of all types  ...     ...     ...     ...     c.  850-950         Aero-engines of all  types     ...     ...     ...     c.    1,900         Complete  aircraft of first-line types only     ...     c.      650         Labour employed on airframes ...     ...     ...     c.   145,550         Labour employed on engines  ...     ...     ...     c.    51,500                 Total labour.......  .....     ...     c.   197,050             NOTE. The labour figures exclude semi-manufactures, repairs, and                 the manufacture of instruments,  accessories,  armament and  &quot;:               W/T equipment.     The unusual fluctuations in the German industry during the past six monthsmake it difficult to adjust reports  covering different periods so as to relate to theprobable rate of output  current in January 1939.  It is pertinent, therefore, to quote figures for our own aircraft industry calculated on the same  basis.  Theseshow that in December 1938 there were about 100,000 employees in the Britishairframe industry who produced 475  aircraft of all types during the month.  Onthis basis the output estimated for the 145,550 employees believed to be engaged on similar work in Germany is  very high.  Against this, however,  must be set avery considerable allowance for superior production conditions in Germany.4. Labour Conditions.     The considerable increase in output during the last  six months has been due partly to the coming into a high rate of production of several new  factories,  butpartly also to the lengthening of  the hours worked throughout the industry.  Anumber of factories, especially those  producing major components,  have at timesbeen working on more than one shift, while hours for individual labour continueto mount up to 60 hours per week.
    Despite some reports of dissatisfaction in Germany owing to the prevalence of long working hours, there has been no evidence of unwillingness on the partof labour engaged in the  aircraft industry to work at this tension.  Not only ispay received at overtime rates, but very generous provision is made for the well-being of the workpeople, in  the shape of  luxurious changing-rooms, swimmingpools, baths, recreation facilities, dining-rooms, &amp;e, and admirable housing.5. Possible Expansion in Emergency.    In contradistinction to what has been  said above, there have been no reportsduring the past few months  of the laying down of new factories,  and it  wouldseem  as though the main plan of factory construction in the German aircraft industry has, at least temporarily, been completed.    This does not rule out the probability that output from existing factories willbe still further increased during 1939, or even the possibility that  new factoriesmay be built.   There are already instances of output of complete aircraft beingattained on sites that twelve months previously were  but agricultural land.Moreover, there is some further room for normal expansion in existing  factories;two ex-Austrian airframe factories are being re-conditioned and enlarged, whilethe acquisition of the Sudetenland has  given  the Reich  another aero-enginefactory.    The considerable  introduction of female labour augmenting the steady flow of trained mechanics from the large apprentice schools will gradually alleviate thepresent  shortage  of labour  and  in  the  event  of national mobilisation some additional labour might be made available fairly quickly from other trades.    Nevertheless, since a number of factories are reported to be working morethan  one shift, while several component factories were  reported to be working to capacity during the  September crisis, it would  not seem possible for Germanyrapidly to double or still less to treble the  present monthly output, even under conditions of mobilisation.     If it be correct that, under the  conditions closely  approaching mobilisationwhich obtained in the late summer of  1938, a rate of output of about 1,000 military aircraft per month was achieved after two or three months&apos; preparations to that end,  it seems unlikely that at present in the first few months of war the Germanoutput of complete aircraft of first-line types would exceed 1,500 per month.6. Conclusions.     It may therefore be concluded that      (a) The monthly rate of output of the German aircraft industry should at           present be reckoned at about 900 an*craft of all types, of which about           650 are of first-line types.     (b) A much higher  rate  of output  was achieved for  a short time  during           September  last year,  estimated by  the French Air  Staff to have           included military first-line types at the rate of about  1,000 per  month.           This rate was probably  achieved, however,  by depleting stocks  of           finished components.     (c) The personnel  employed  in  the  airframe and aero-engine  industry,           excluding those  engaged on  semi-manufactures,  repairs, and  the           manufacture  of instruments, accessories, armament and W/T equip-           ment, is probably in the  neighbourhood of  200,000.      (d) In order to achieve the figures of  estimated output a number of factories           have been working on more than one shift and/or overtime, while some           component factories have been working to capacity.  Individual hours           of labour have been up to sixty per week.      ie) Apart from two airframe factories being reconstructed and enlarged in           Austria and the acquisition of another engine factory in the Sudeten-           land, no reports have been received of further substantial expansion of           capacity  in the Reich since our last report,  and it  may be that the           factory  construction  plan is  now nearly complete or temporarily           suspended.      (/) Some  further expansion in output under  normal conditions is to be           expected during 1939.  On the other hand, the experience of the crisis           in  September 1938 suggests that at present the output of first-line           types  which  Germany would  be likely to  attain under mobilisation            conditions in the  first few months of war will be unlikely to exceed a            rate of about 1,500 a month.[18816]

(C.I.D. Paper No.  1541-B.)    (Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 333M Meeting, Minute (9).)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a note by the Chairman of theSub-Committee on  Industrial  Intelligence  in Foreign  Countries, covering  aMemorandum  on the German Aircraft  Industry, prepared in  collaboration between  the Air Staff  and the  Department  of  Overseas  Trade (industrial intelligence  Centre),  and based  on  information  available  up   to   the1st February, 1939 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1541-B).    SIR QUINTIN  HILL,  Chairman of  the  Sub-Committee  on industrial intelligence in Foreign Countries, said that later information suggested that thepresent rate of output of the German industry, apart from the  Czech aircraft industry, was probably something over a thousand aircraft of all  types  per month, of which up to 750 per month might be of first line types.    In  response to  a question from  Mr.  Hore-Belisha, SIR QUINTIN HILLsaid  that  the increased  rate of  output  reached  in  Germany  during  the september  1938 crisis was achieved by reducing  stocks of components.  Thepresent increased rate was maintained by normal  production methods, withoutdepleting stocks of  components.    Continuing, SIR QUINTIN HILL said that a  temporary decline in Germanoutput for a month  or two might occur owing to the fact that a new bomber, the&quot; Junkers 88,&quot; was  now going into quantity production in a number of the biggerfactories.    In reply to a question from  Lord  Chatfield, SIR CYRIL NEW ALL Saidthat he  had no information as to the truth of newspaper reports that largenumbers of Czech aircraft had been flown away at the time of the German occupa-tion of Bohemia and Moravia.  He added that, during his recent visit to Warsaw,the Poles had expressed astonishment that this had  not been done.    SIR KINGSLEY WOOD pointed out that, during March,  British outputhad risen to 740 air frames of  all types. The April figures were not likely to be quite so good owing to the Easter holidays and other reasons. It would appearthat if the French  could  increase their output our combined output  would be within measurable distance of that achieved by Germany, but not of Germany andItaly combined.  As the Committee knew, he was actively pursuing this matter with the French.  At the present time our output was well ahead of forecasts andno serious setbacks  had been met.  He  hoped in due course to reach even better-figures than those for the March output.       [19075]
     SIR THOMAS INSKIP referred to  the last sentence of paragraph 3 ofthe report, as follows :          &quot; Against this, however, must be  set a  very considerable allowance for   .  superior production conditions in  Germany&quot;                          ;  &apos;?He asked the meaning  of the term &quot;superior production conditions.&quot;     MB. MORTON said that the Germans had started production on a muchbroader basis than ourselves;  they had also started earlier.  Consequently theyhad larger factories in operation resulting in superior mass production.  Germanlabour worked very long hours up to 60 hours a  Week.     SIR  KINGSLEY  WOOD  said  that  some of our new  factories  such asRootes and the Nuffield Factory were in every way equal to the German plants.The Germans exercised compulsory powers  over  labour which gave them  an advantage.  He had heard that the long hours worked in Germany were having aprejudicial effect.     MR. MORTON said that evidence of dissatisfaction over labour conditionsin Germany was increasing.     SIR THOMAS INSKIP referred to  the last sentence of paragraph 5 ofthe report, as follows :          &quot; It seems unlikely that at present in the first few months of war the     German output of  complete aircraft of first-line types would  exceed 1,500     per month.&quot;He asked whether the Germans would be able to maintain this output  of 1,500a, month after the first  few months of war.     MR. MORTON confirmed that a  bottle-neck  would arise in  the provisionof components for the assembly  factories.     LORD CHATFIELD asked whether the  total number of aircraft available  .to each  side in war was likely to increase or to decrease.     SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that  both sides might  anticipate a considerableloss of output owing to air action  and air  raid warnings.  Our own output was likely to fall off after war began. i    ME. HORE-BELISHA suggested that the rate of output maintained bythe  Germans, at a time when they had over a  million  men under arms,  repre-sented a very remarkable  achievement.  He  realised  that  methods  were usedwhich we could not ourselves employ,  but he felt that  we had a  great deal to learn if we were to organise our man-power efficiently.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD pointed out that  questions of dilution and  of theemployment of female labour  raised great difficulties in this  country.  He feltthat, in our special circumstances, it was essential to pursue the method of mutualadjustment with the Trades Unions.     MR. HORE-BELISHA then  referred to  the provision   of amenities for german labour, as evidenced in  the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the Report,as follows :--         &apos;&apos; Not only is pay received at overtime rates, but very generous provision     is made for the well-being of the work people, in the shape  of luxurious     changing rooms, swimming  pools,  baths,  recreation facilities,  dining-rooms,     and admirable housing.&quot;In the  case of the Ordnance  Factories run by  the War Office, there were themost serious restrictions on the provision of amenities.  For example, he had recently had difficulty in obtaining a hut for use  as a bath house at the OrdnanceDepot at Corsham.     SIR KINGSLEY WOOD believed that the  great efficiency attributed to theGermans was exaggerated.  He  thought that,  if we over here  could exercise thepowers  which were used in Germany, there was little  doubt that we should bedissatisfied with an output of  a thousand air  frames a month.
CONCLUSION.THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE agreed     That the Memorandum on the German Aircraft Industry (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1541-B), together with the above minutes, should be remitted to theCabinet.   y .rH&apos;          ^          -71-          -j^          ^Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,      ,4pWZ 20, 1939.
