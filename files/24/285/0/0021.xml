Copy No.  43CP. 99 (39).CABINET.VISIT  OF ROUMANIAN FOREIGN  MINISTER,  APRIL 23-26,  1939.                        RECORD OF CONVERSATIONS.        Memorandum by the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs.    I CIRCULATE to  my  colleagues the records of the conversations whichthe Prime  Minister  and I had with the  Roumanian  Foreign Minister during his recent visit to London.                                                                      H.    April 27,  1939.FIRST MEETING  (in the Secretary of State&apos;s Room at the Foreign  Office on                           April  24 at  11  A.M.).                                  Present:         Lord Halifax  (Secretary of State for.Foreign Affairs).         Sir  A. Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of  State).         Mr. Ingram (Foreign Office).         Mr. Strang (Foreign Office).         M. Gafencu (Roumanian Minister for  Foreign  Affairs).         M. Tilea (Roumanian Minister in London).M.  Gafencu&apos;s  recent   Conversations  with  Turkish,  Polish  and  German         Governments.     M. Gafencu suggested that  he might start by giving an  account  of  the conversations he had recently had with  the Turkish Foreign Minister,  with thePolish Foreign Minister, and with  Herr Hitler  and others in Berlin.  He hadbeen authorised by his Government to  inform Lord Halifax and M. Bonnet ofwhat had passed, and he begged that his report might be kept secret.Conversations with the Turkish Foreign Minister.     M. Gafencu said that he had gone to Istanbul at Easter to find out whetherRoumania could count on the absolute support of Turkey.  He had first thought of making contact with representatives of all the  members of the Balkan Entente(of which he was.at  present president), .but since the Yugoslavs would  probably not have sent a representative to Istanbul, he decided to see the Turkish  Ministeralone.    He had  spent two  days in  Istanbul.  A proces-verbal of  the proceedingshad been signed, and there had been added to this signed document certain notes,in terms agreed upon by the Turkish Foreign Minister and himself.  The turkish ambassador  in London had  been  fully informed of the contents of  these documents.    In the signed proces-verbal the two Governments took note of  the fact thatthere were signs that an attempt was being  made  to establish domination inEurope, which would, in particular, constitute a  menace for Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.  They also took note of the fact that resistance to this attempt       10359   [19106&apos;]                                               B
at domination was growing.  They recorded that the Roumanian Foreign minister had informed the Turkish Foreign Minister of what had passed between himself and the British and French Governments, while the Turkish Foreign Minister, inhis turn, informed  the Roumanian Foreign Minister of his  conversations withthe Bulgarian Government.                                          l &apos;&apos;.    The notes appended to this proces-verbal contained seven points, of which thepurport was generally as follows :--                               .          .v    (1) The  Turkish and Roumanian  Governments would make  every effort to           reinforce the  Balkan Entente  and to increase its efficacy in action.:           They would pursue with regard to Bulgaria a benevolent and friendly           policy in the spirit of the Salonika Agreement.  The two Governments,           together  with their  friends  and  allies,  would  invite  Bulgaria to           collaborate with the members of the Balkan Entente, in the economic           and cultural sphere and in the sphere of communications, in order to           strengthen their  common interests.   (M.  Gafencu said  that he had       ;    invited  the  Bulgarian &apos; Government  to  send  a representative  th           Bucharest on the 17th May to the Economic Conference of the Balkan           Entente.)          .  -  --       i   -A    (2) The two States would pursue a prudent policy and avoid all unnecessary           provocation,  and  endeavour to obtain guarantees  from the  Great           Powers,  in order to ensure peace  and preserve their independence.    (3) If  events should impose on Roumania or  Turkey, or oh both, or on the           members of the Balkan Entente as a whok%  the necessity of making           a  choice or taking up  a  definite position as between the groups of           Powers which were now face to face, it was understood  that Roumania           and Turkey would act in common, and would insist that their allies of the           Balkan Entente should join the group which was uniting and organising           itself  with  the object of creating common  resistance to  tendencies           directed towards domination which threatened their independence and           security.  (M. Gafencu said that this was, of course,  the vital  point           in the arrangement,  and he begged that we  should  not  make any           disclosure of it.)    (4) If, in the  circumstances  foreshadowed  in  point (3),  Roumania were           obliged to give to  her  treaty of alliance  with Poland the complete           and general  interpretation  which results from its terms, or if, still           in conformity  with point (3),  Turkey  found herself obliged to con-           clude a definite alliance with a third Power, and if by reason of this           one of the two States  were drawn into  a conflict,  the other  would           give to the Balkan Pact its widest interpretation, that is to say, the           obligation of assistance would operate against any hostile intervention           on the part of a Balkan  State.    (5) In a case where, in accordance with  point (3), Roumania was  forced           to undertake  military action, and if Turkey were to remain  either           temporarily or permanently outside the  conflict,  it was understood           that  Turkey would maintain a  benevolent  and  friendly neutrality.           (M. Gafencu explained that this meant that Turkey would not make           use of her right of inspection of ships passing  through the Straits           and carrying help to Roumania.)                                 ;    (6) In any conversations  that might take place with the Great Powers for           the organisation of common resistance, Roumania and Turkey would           try to obtain all necessary details with the object of securing effective           military assistance (troops,  material, arms, munitions, vessels of war,           aircraft) so  that their participation  might  contribute effectively  to           the final success.    (7) Roumania and Turkey would keep each other informed of any proposals           made to them on this subject by the Great Powers,  and of any negotia-           tions  they might pursue with the Great Powers,  and  they  would           consult each  other in.  all circumstances.  If  necessary,  they  would           supplement their diplomatic contacts by military  contacts for the           purpose of co-ordinating measures of military defence.    M.. Gafencu explained that the general purpose of Roumania and Turkey was to try and save peace in  Eastern  Europe.   If this  should prove impossible,then both  Powers would join the same group, and  that group  would have  tobe the group which was opposed to domination in Europe.
Conversations with the Polish Foreign Minister. .,  M. Gafencu said that M. Beck had told him that Lord Halifax had spoken to  him of the desirability of extending the Polish-Roumanian Treaty so  as to,cover an attack from the west as well, as from the east.    Lord Halifax said the arrangement which  he had  made with Colonel Beckwas that the latter should have discussions with M. Gafencu before he answeredour question, that question being whether Poland would support Roumania inthe event of an attack on Roumania from the west.  M. Beck&apos;s answer had beenthat he must first discuss this question with his ally before giving a reply. -. . - M. Gafencu said that he had been surprised that M.  Beck had not approached the Roumanian Government immediately on his  return to Warsaw from London.M. Gafencu had made enquiries in Paris, and had been  told that M. Beck had letit be understood that it was for the Roumanians and not for the Poles to initiatethis  discussion.  M.  Gafencu knew  M. Beck  very well   and knew  what  hishesitations were.  M. Beck was clearly afraid of being charged with aiming at apolicy of encirclement, and therefore preferred that Roumania should take  theinitiative.    In the Roumanian view it would not have been right to make the Anglo-French  guarantee to  Roumania depend upon  an extension of  the  Polish-Roumanian Treaty.   To have done this would have given M. Beck an opportunityto deny to Roumania the guarantee which they hoped for from Great Britain andFrance.  In the event, the Roumanian Government were delighted to have receiveda  guarantee from  Great  Britain  and  France  freely and  unilaterally, andM. Gafencu took the opportunity of thanking His Majesty&apos;s Government in thename of the King of Roumania and the Roumanian Government.  This  guarantee to Roumania had, he heard, made a great, impression in Yugoslavia.    M. Gafencu continued that it was on M. Beck&apos;s suggestion that they had met in the train on his journey through Poland to Berlin.     The following was what passed between himself and M. Beck :     M. Beck said that the Polish-Roumanian Alliance had been made against russia.  Historically and politically Russia was the danger; moreover, she  was aneighbour. There had been no need to make it against Germany, since Roumaniawas  not a neighbour of Germany.  If Hungary attacked  Roumania, Roumaniacould defend herself alone.  If Germany attacked Poland, Roumania would haveher hands full on her Hungarian and Bulgarian frontiers and would not be ableto send much help to Poland.  If there  were a general war, both  Poland and roumania would obviously be in the same camp.   That being so, what was thepoint of formally extending a pact if the only . result  would  be to irritate  theGerman Government?    M. Gafencu said that he had replied  to M.  Beck that he himself  had, ofcourse, no interest in a policy of encirclement.  It was not his desire to make anew  pact against Germany.  He did not think this was necessary in view of theterms of the existing treaty.  This treaty was of the classic type and established a general obligation.  By article  1 both parties undertook reciprocally  to respecta,nd maintain against all external aggression their actual territorial integrity and existing political independence.  Part of  article 2 provided for special technicalarrangements which would lay down the method of execution of the obligation.So far only one such  technical  arrangement had been made between the twoGovernments, namely, to meet the case of an attack by Russia.   He had explained to M. Beck that the  treaty already was a general treaty, and that there was no need to create a sensation in the press and elsewhere by making a new one.  Itwas in the interests of both Governments to avoid this.  The right thing to do wasto give an exact interpretation of the existing treaty, and this interpretation couldonly be a wide  one.   At some appropriate stage later on their two governments could instruct their  soldiers to make arrangements for other hypotheses, such as.for example, a Hungarian attack or a German attack.    M. Gafencu said that M. Beck had replied that he was  in agreement withthis  argument.   He agreed with  this interpretation, and authorised M. Gafencuso to inform  the Governments of the Western Powers.  He understood that thePolish Ambassador here had had instructions from Warsaw to make a communi-cation  to  this effect  but  that he had. wished to wait for  M.  Gafenchs arrival in London before making it.       [19106]                                                    B 2
    Lord  Halifax asked whether this meant&apos; that M. Beck acknowledged the&apos;general  interpretation which  M. Gafencu  had given  to article 1 of the treaty,and had expressed willingness at the appropriate time to make  the same  kind.of technical arrangements to meet the imaginary case of a Hungarian or german attack as had been made in the imaginary case of a Russian attack.    M.  Gafencu agreed that  this was so.  It was important not to go too fastwith M. Beck.  They both agreed that the present treaty was sufficient, and theywould keep His Majesty&apos;s Government informed of any further steps they might,take.    Lord  Halifax enquired what was M. Gafencu&apos;s impression as to when, andin what conditions, M. Beck  would be  willing to  enter  on  these  technical discussions.                                                              :    M.  Gafencu replied that if M. Beck thought that  all was lost  with Germany,he would  open these discussions. Tf he  thought that something could  still bedone with Germany, he would not.  M. Beck&apos;s case vis-a-vis Germany was thatall  that he had done  so far  was to reinforce  an existing arrangement  with france  by a new arrangement  with  Great  Britain  on similar  lines.   As theGermans had accepted the Polish-French Treaty, there was no reason  why theyshould not accept the Anglo-Polish  arrangement. What he had  done  with HisMajesty&apos;s  Government was  a  mere matter  of degree and not a change of policy.Moreover, he had avoided any Russian entanglement.    M.  Gafencu went on to say that he had taken up M. Beck&apos;s  statement thatif Hungary attacked,  Roumania could resist her  alone.   This  might be  true,but Hungary would not attack on her own  initiative.  Germany would fomenttroubles in Roumania and whet Hungary&apos;s territorial ambitions.  Germany would wish  to lay hands on Roumanian oil so  as  to be in  a better position to make an attack on the Western Powers.   He had  put it to M. Beck  that if Polanddid not move in such circumstances,  Poland  would be encircled and it would be too late for her  to  do anything.   Hungary would  march 100  per cent,  withGermany, and would think herself well compensated by territorial aggrandisementfor the  loss of her independence. In M. Gafencu&apos;s view, Hungary had already made a definite choice.  M.  de Kanya, the former  Foreign Minister, had not done  so, but Count  Csaky had made his choice.  M. Gafencu said that M.  Beckseemed  to  agree with all this.  He  did not  think it impossible to reach  sometechnical  agreement with M. Beck,  but  it  was important not  to go too  fast.M.  Beck would not yet abandon his  hope  of a detente with Germany.    M. Gafencu thought, therefore, that a definite step had been made towardsthe achievement of what London and Paris wanted.    The  account he had  given to Lord Halifax  of his conversations  withM.  Beck had been confirmed by the Polish Ambassador in London.    Lord Halifax expressed  gratitude for this  very helpful review.Conversations in Berlin.    M. Gafencu said that he had begun his journey  to Berlin with considerableapprehension.  There  had been great  tension  between  the two countries inDecember last, when the Roumanian Government had  suppressed the Iron Guard,an  organisation subsidised by Germany,  whose programme was to change  theinternal regime and the foreign policy of Roumania.  Its suppression had caused a violent  reaction in Germany.  Herr Hitler had  been incensed, and  the  party had tried to rush him into action.  It was commonly said in Germany,  that Rou-mania was the next country to be tackled, and in Sofia and Budapest the claims of bulgaria,  and Hungary against Roumania were strongly supported by  Germany.     When he became Minister for Foreign  Affairs  a few weeks  ago,  his firstobject had been to create a detente with Germany.  He had tried to do this in theeconomic  field first, by placing the  complementary interests of  Roumania andGermany, which were many,  on a basis of possible collaboration.  The first stephad been to get Germany into the European. Commission of the Danube.  Thiswas better than having Germany.outside trying to destroy the commission.  then there was the famous Economic Agreement with Germany, in  securing which germany had used, as a means of pressure, the tension existing in  Europe.  Aftersignature, the German Government had invited him to Berlin and had indicated that  the great quarrel was at an end.  Before it had been reached they adopted
the most menacing attitude, violently attacking King Carol and the roumanian government.  He had been reluctant to go to Germany at that time,  but  had subsequently agreed to go, not for Herr Hitler&apos;s birthday as the German Govern-ment wished, but two days before,,  He had also wished to combine his visit to berlin with visits to London  and Paris.  He was also anxious  to secure theBritish and French guarantee before he arrived in Berlin.    Roumania  regarded the  guarantees  by  Great  Britain and France  as animportant element in the situation, and as marking the presence of Great Britainand France in Eastern Europe.   This was important in time of peace as well as intime of war, since it established equilibrium in Europe.  The British declarationabout Roumania had had a great effect in  Budapest and Sofia.    M.  Gafencu said that, to his astonishment,  the  conversations in Berlin  had proceeded quietly on normal lines.  There had been no threats; he was asked forno special explanations, and was not pressed to give any undertakings.  herr hitler and Herr von Ribbentrop had  been courteous and cordial.  Field-MarshalGoring, however, who had just returned from Italy, and had not  been  in touchwith his colleagues, took rather a different line and expressed  astonishment  thatRoumania had accepted guarantees from Great Britain and France.   He had askedM. Gafencu how Great  Britain and France could help Roumania.  M.  Gafencuhad replied  that he could not  think  who  it was  that was  likely to attack Rou-mania.  Hungary was not in a position to do so, and if  Russia did, germany would no doubt  help Roumania.  Field-Marshal  Goring had,  with some embarrassing-rassment,  agreed that this was so.  It was  true that no one would  think of attacking  Roumania, but  all the same the policy of encirclement might be a dangerous one for Roumania to pursue.  To this M. Gafencu replied that there was indeed encirclement, but no policy of encirclement.  Governments rightly hesitatedto try to encircle Germany, but their  peoples were more courageous.  What therewas was a psychological encirclement. German ambitions were unlimited  andthe principles on which German policy was based filled people with alarm;  and peoples  felt it necessary to defend themselves.   This was as true of the Yugoslavpeople as it was, for example, of  the Turkish  people.  He had told the field-marshal that when the German economic experts had come to Bucharest 90 percent, of the Roumanian people wanted an agreement with Germany.  When, how-ever, he had signed  that agreement, he had no one at all behind  him, and thereason was  plain.  Germany had  just occupied Bohemia and that had trans-formed  the sentiment of the people as regards Germany.    M.  Gafencu said that he had the impression  that Field-Marshal Goring hadrather liked being spoken to in that way, especially when M. Gafencu had pointedout that, though he had been a diplomat only  a few weeks, he  had been  a soldierfor many years.    His interview with Herr  Hitler had lasted one and  a half hours, and nodoubt Herr Hitler  intended that what  he said should  be  passed on to  HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    Hitler began speaking quietly and then, after a time, had become excited, inthe usual way.  He behaved like a force of  nature. He was at  the same time  veryhuman and tried to put his points clearly and simply. There was no doubt  thathis remarks had been well prepared,  since Herr von Ribbentrop had taken threehours to say the same kind of thing to M.  Gafencu before his intervie^^with herr Hitler.                                                         ^&quot;N    Herr  Hitler said that his whole struggle  had  been  directed towards \hedestruction of the Versailles Treaty.  Most of this  task had  been  achieved, butthere  were still more things to be done.  In answer to M. Gafencu&apos;s observationthat  Germany&apos;s principles of  conduct   seemed to  admit  of  no  limitation,Herr Hitler observed that he had strictly limited  his action in  a number of ways.He had limited  it by the Naval Agreement with  Great Britain, by the abandon-ment  of Alsace-Lorraine to France,  by the abandonment of the South  Tyrol toItaly, and by the abandonment of the Germans in Yugoslavia and Roumania.He said that little States had suspected  him of aggressive  designs.   He gaveM. Gafencu his word of honour that he had no intentions whatever of attackingBelgi um or Holland or Switzerland, either  as  pledges  in time of peace or to enlarge his front in time of war. What he wanted was his own colonies and notBelgian or Dutch colonies, and he was determined to get  them.  There was no need for him to widen his front in case of war.   The best policy  was to  attack the existing front.  There was no front, however narrow, that could not be pierced
toy modern machines of war.  He had no intention of supporting Hungary againstRoumania, nor had he any claims against Roumania.  He had told the HungarianForeign  Minister  that  the Germans  in  Roumania were quite happy  to  be(Roumanian subjects and wished to remain so.  The same was true of the germans in Yugoslavia.    Herr Hitler had been  somewhat contemptuous about  the Hungarians.  Hesaid that Germany had helped them in 1914 and had received no help from them.The Austro-Hungarian ultimatum  to Serbia had been a foolish act.  He himself would never have done anything so unwise.   What he would have done would havebeen  to propose the  partition of  the Austro-Hungarian Empire on a  soundethnographical basis.    Herr Hitler had been  very  angry with England.   He said that England.wanted to prevent Germany from  developing, both politically and economically,and to hinder her from  feeding herself and to bar Germany&apos;s vital aspirations.He denied that Roosevelt spoke  with the voice of America, and regarded him as a naive and ridiculous person,  encircled by British  diplomacy.  The  policyof France, too, was under British direction.  France really wanted appeasement,but was not allowed to pursue her own policy.   He could not understand what had come over M.  Daladier.   It was  all England&apos;s fault.  If England wantedwar, she could have it, and it would be such a war as had never been seen before.Not only had Germany the strongest army in the world,  but her technicians andphysicists had not been idle.  Things would be seen that had never been seenbefore.  German towns  would no  doubt not escape,  but on the  other side nota single town would continue to exist; and after all no one would profit fromthis disaster except Moscow.;  :,  M. Gafencu said that he  did  not think Herr Hitler wanted war.  He didnot in his heart of hearts dislike England.  He said he had been accused of beingAnglophile, and he  did not deny the accusation.  He wished  for  friendship with  the British Empire, but on  a basis  of  equality,  which he  thought wasnecessary for the maintenance of white civilisation, but England must understandthat Greater Germany had  equal  rights in any compromise  that was reached.The trouble was, M. Gafencu said, that German ambitions had no limit. .  &quot;Whenthey said they  wanted  a compromise, what they really wanted was to  divide the Empire of the world, and they might not even stop there.    In M. Gafencu&apos;s view  the danger was not  so much that there, was a desire for war, but  that existing methods might lead to war.   War might arise  out ofsome  error of psychology, such, for example, as  a tendency to under-estimate thepower and will of Great Britain and France to resist.    Lord Halifax  said  he hoped that  M. Gafencu would give  him a clear indication, if Herr Hitler had done  so, of what exactly Herr  Hitler though this Majesty&apos;s Government  were  doing that was wrong.    M. Gafencu said he thought  that  what Herr  Hitler objected to was theBritish policy of equilibrium in Europe.  Herr Hitler&apos;s own policy might be summed up in the words : &quot; The world for England; Europe for me.&quot;   . M.  Gafencu  thought  that German  aims admitted  of no  limit.   Anycompromise they might reach was  apt to be a first step only.  The absorption ofthe Sudeten  country had been followed by the occupation of what was left ofBohemia and Moravia.  In the same way any general compromise would  only bea first step towards world domination.    Herr Hitler, speaking of Roumania, had said that the economies of Germanyand Roumania were complementary.  Roumania could supply food and receivemachinery in  return.   The  two countries could  therefore make an equalcommercial treaty.   If  foreigners interfered in this matter, their only objectcould be to prevent Germany  from feeding herself.     M.  Gafencu  explained  that  Roumania&apos;s interest was to have a broadeconomic agreement with Germany, but to  keep a margin  in reserve so as to seta limit to Germany&apos;s economic influence.  He had explained this to Sir F. Leith-Russ  when he had seen him in Brussels. Roumania did  not wish to fall into theclosed economy of Germany.  It was not in the interests of Roumania and, indeed,it was not in the general  interests that the area of closed economy should beextended.     Reverting  to  his  interview  with Herr  Hitler,   M. Gafencu said that herr Hitler  was also incensed against Poland.  Herr Hitler said that  he had
always wanted  to maintain. the&quot; agreement reached with Pilsudski, even thoughthe Corridor..was absurd and the German minorities were atrociously treated.After the occupation of  Bohemia, he had made to Poland an offer which, forgenerosity, was unique in history.  What he proposed was that  Danzig shouldbe returned to Germany;  that a special economic regime should be established bywhich Danzig, as a port. and. as a. centre of communications, should remain withinPolish economy.  Germany would have right of passage through the  Corridor,and would guarantee the Polish frontier, including the  Corridor and Gdynia,for twenty-five years.  Finally, he had  offered Poland  a tripartite  (German-Polish-Hungarian) regime for Slovakia:  .    Herr Hitler said that &apos;M. Beck had answered this offer by going to London,and that he would never make so generous an offer again.    Both Herr Hitler and  Herr von Ribbentrop had  said  that the  Danzigquestion must  be settled.  M.  Gafencu was  certain that in  his  speech on the28th April Herr Hitler would speak of Danzig and the colonies.  He had spokena great deal of  the colonies to M. Gafencu.  Field-Marshal Goring also had beenstrong on the point.  He said that he had been astonished in  Libya to see whata totalitarian State could do, not only in the way of economic development, butalso in the way of transplanting a population.  The field-marshal had said that both Germany and Italy needed colonies, and would never give up their claim.    M. Gafencu said that Herr Hitler had reproached Roumania for calling uponGreat  Britain  and France to fight for her.  M. Gafencu said that roumania had not done  this;  she  was determined to fight  for her own  independence.Herr Hitler  had taken this  remark well.   M. Gafencu&apos;s  impression was that what made Herr Hitler angry was not so much  the things that other people saidto him as the ideas that grew in his own  mind.    Lord Halifax enquired whether M. Gafencu had gained the impression that herr Hitler blamed His  Majesty&apos;s Government for M. Beck&apos;s attitude.    M. Gafencu replied  that this was perhaps so.  He had an impression that herr Hitler was angry because he had thought that, after Munich, Great Britainand France would not stay in Eastern Europe.  Now he found  that  they were there again and that the idea of European equilibrium, which he thought he had destroyed, had  raised its head again.     M. Gafencu also had the  impression that Herr  Hitler was angry because he  wanted to be angry so that he could make demands, e.g., for colonies, in  his speech.   He would  make  his anger a  pretext  for  demanding  some  new&quot; compromise.&quot;     M. Gafencu thought that the best course would be to speak to Herr Hitlerin  the same way as  he spoke to others.  It was  important not  to let Germanyput forward new demands or new claims on  the basis of abstract justice.  Sucha claim could  be advanced for the incorporation of  Danzig.  The thing to do would be to  say quite clearly to Herr Hitler that, no matter what his claimsmight be, these could not  be considered until Germany  had quitted Prague, where she had no  right to be.  The whole world knew that by  going to  Prague,Herr Hitler  had made a mistake and had caused every nation in the world to feel itself threatened.     There was little doubt that Herr  Hitler would come forward in his speechwith new arguments based on his conception of justice.   Danzig, he would say,was Germany;  the Corridor, he would say, cut the German people in two; andsimilarly the colonies he wanted  were German colonies.   In  everything he said there was likely to be at any rate the  appearance of  law.  What other  Govern-ments ought to do was to use arguments which would strike the imagination asHerr Hitler&apos;s arguments did.     Lord Halifax observed that what made it difficult to deal with Herr hitler and the  German  Government was  that, however  much they might speak  of compromise,  they  had little  notion of compromise except on their own terms.What made  the problem intractable  was that the Germans  were apt to thinkthings were everybody&apos;s  fault but their  own, like the soldier who was the onlyman in his company to be in step.     Did M.  Gafencu think it likely that M. Beck  would be  able to come to anagreement with Germany about Danzig ? M. Beck had told  Lord Halifax thathe would not accept an  imposed solution or a fait accompli, but was prepared
to. come to an arrangement with Germany by which the population of  Danzigmight enjoy all the rights of self-government within an international framework.M Beck wished to  preserve Danzig&apos;s international position and not to  have itincorporated in the Reich.   In the same way, while he could not agree to an extra-territorial motor road, he was prepared to make every concession in the way of transit facilities.  Lord. Halifax feared, however, that this would not be enough for Herr Hitler.    M.  Gafencu said that  M. Beck had told him that he had a margin in his negotiations with Germany.  M. Gafencu had  asked  him  what the situation would be if Germany occupied Danzig.  M.  Beck had replied that that wouldmean war.   From what had been said to him in Berlin,  it seemed to M. Gafencuthat the German claims went  well beyond M. Beck&apos;s margin.   In  Berlin thesituation was thought to be dangerous.   The Italian Ambassador  had asked him  to use his influence with M. Beck and to persuade him that the germans were really in  earnest.  He  had told this to the Polish Ambassador in Berlin and asked him to pass it on to  M. Beck.   M. Beck and Marshal Smigly-Rydz were,he feared, rather intransigent in this matter.    M.  Gafencu said he still thought that the  important thing to do  was to destroy  Germany&apos;s moral position by saying that we could discuss nothing untilshe quitted Prague.  If any concessions were made to Germany,  it should be inreturn for something.    Lord Halifax enquired whether, as a matter of practical politics, M. Gafencuthought that it was likely that  the Germans would restore Prague.    M.  Gafencu replied that perhaps they might establish some new kind ofregime.  The rest of the world must not give anything more to Germany without compensation.   The Munich settlement might have been a marvellous thing; butthe trouble was that there was  no compensation.   There had been an agreement under the shadow of a victory, instead of an agreement under the shadow of an act of compensation.  In his view everything should be done to &quot;save peace and keep the door open for negotiation;  but peace must be based on compensation    Sir A. Cadogan said he saw the force of this argument, but  the restorationof Prague would hardly be a compensation to Poland.    M.  Gafencu said that, on the other hand, Slovakia would be a compensationThe  Poles felt that they were being encircled by  German  influence in Slovakia.Herr Hitler had  told M. Gafencu that he had proposed  to M.  Beck a specialtripartite regime for Slovakia (in which Germany, Poland and Hungary would participate), and that  this  would be the means of reducing tension  in  central europe.    M.  Gafencu did not think it impossible that there might be some change ofregime both at Prague and  in Slovakia.    Lord Halifax assumed that if there were anything to be made of this idea,it would have  to go  through the machinery of free conversations, or a conference.He doubted whether Herr Hitler would accept this.    M.  Gafencu said that his impression was that Herr Hitler did not want  war.He wanted a new success;  in fact, he must have a new success, both for internalreasons  and for reasons of  temperament.   He had insisted half a dozen times toM. Gafencu that all that he had achieved had been achieved without sheddingblood.     Sir A. Cadogan said that men who must have successes were very dangerous.     M.  Gafencu repeated that for that reason he thought it essential to introduce the principle of compensation.  Abstract justice  was all very well, but practicaljustice was better.  If the Germans were told that they must quit Prague beforeanything else  could be discussed, the whole world would understand.Conversations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Turkish Government.     M.  Gafencu asked what progress  His Majesty&apos;s Government had made intheir conversations with the Turkish Government. &apos;     Lord Halifax explained that the main purpose His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad  in  view was to build  up, and  to help  in building up Balkan unity and
ystrength.  Turkey was of very great importance from this point of view.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government had approached the Turkish Government and asked them whether they were prepared to take part in this.  It was also explained to themthat if there were an act of aggression by one of the Axis  Powers either in western Europe or Eastern Europe or in South-Eastern Europe, the problem wasa single one.  It must be assumed that the two Axis Powers would act together.The consequence was that wherever war started it was likely to be a general war.In  that event His Majesty&apos;s  Government  said  that  they would like to knowwhether they could count on the Turkish Government.  The Turkish reply was,in. effect,  that they accepted this point of view.  The most useful thing they could do, they  thought, would  be to continue to use their influence in the interests ofBalkan unity.  In any general conflict, they had no  doubt that they would be with  us, and they gave  a general  assurance to this  effect.  They  were ratheruncertain whether, as a  matter of procedure, it  was wise to try to do too muchat once.  In any event, they would continue their efforts in the Balkans.  Theywould also consider making a public statement to  the effect  that they would preserve their neutrality unless there were an  act of aggression by  the axis power in the Mediterranean or the Balkans.   His Majesty&apos;s Government had replied that they thought this was a wise attitude, but that they would wish for something a little clearer.  There might well be an act of aggression, not in the balkans or the Mediterranean, but elsewhere, and that a general war might arisestarted by an act of aggression elsewhere.  His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore suggested that instead of speaking of an act of aggression in the Balkans  and mediterranean, it might  be better to speak of an act of aggression leading to warin the Balkans and Mediterranean.  They were still awaiting the considered reply of  the Turkish  Government to this suggestion.   The Turkish Government  had also suggested exchanges of military information, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad replied that they were willing.   One of the principal points to be coveredwould be Turkish action  in regard to the Straits.     The broad  position  between His Majesty&apos;s Government  and  the TurkishGovernment  (and the French position was the same), was that the general outlookof the two Governments  was the same and the Turkish attitude had been helpful.They wished, of course,  to avoid damaging their relations with Germany  andItaly by doing anything provocative, but they wished to play their part in theirown  Balkan  region and  in the Mediterranean, and there was little doubt that  ifthere was general war they would be in the same camp as ourselves.Bulgaria.     Mr. Ingram said that he thought that the Turkish Government were a littlein the dark  as to the attitude of the Roumanian Government towards the  pro-posals which the Turkish Government had made to the Roumanian government about bringing Bulgaria into the Balkan Entente.     M. Gafencu said that the problem was how to strengthen the Balkan Entente. It was desirable to get Bulgaria in, but how was this to be done ?  Bulgaria had certain territorial claims which affected Roumania and Greece.  The Roumanian Government had given an answer to the Turkish Government, though the Turkish Government   had   not   pressed   the Roumanian   Government  very  hard.M. G.afencu&apos;s view was that to make territorial concessions at the present momentwould weaken the  resistance  to domination which was growing up in eastern europe.    One  of   the  results  would  be to  provoke  Hungarian  demands.Roumania would find herself in the same position as Czecho-Slovakia.  It  wasdisastrous for a country to  lose its frontiers during a period of tension. It  wasimpossible for Roumania to consent  to weaken herself so much as  to depriveherself of the power to  resist.  If this happened, the Balkans were lost, sinceRoumania was in a key  position.     Roumania was ready to make an arrangement  with Bulgaria about com-munications and the treatment of minorities; but it would be fatal to make any territorial concessions now.  If territorial changes were made for the benefit of hungary the results would be that for every two Hungarians  who returned  toHungary,  ten Roumanians and one German would pass into foreign sovereigntywith them.  The case of Bulgaria was less difficult.   There was in the SouthernDobrudja an area where the Bulgarian population was fairly compact.  In other circumstances,  some concession might  be considered.   It would be too dangerousnow.  The Greek Government took the same view.[19106]c
    Lord Halifax quite understood the danger of  raising territorial questions in present circumstances. . It would be desirable, if possible, to attach Bulgariato the Balkan Entente  by  making  concessions  in the sphere of economics and communications.  But if Bulgaria were invited to join the Balkan Entente, wouldBulgaria not be likely to make a condition about the Dobrudja?    M. Gafencu  explained that the Balkan Entente was based on the  idea of complete territorial integrity.  The Turkish Government had apparently had itin mind to try to reinforce the external frontiers of the entente, but to leave all questions connected with internal frontiers in suspense.   It would be dangerousfor Roumania at  the present moment to say anything whatever  about territorialconcessions to Bulgaria. One result would be  that  Bulgaria would then pressher claims against Yugoslavia and Greece.  Roumania had to be careful (1) notto weaken her own power  of -resistance,  and   (2)  not  to weaken the  BalkanEntente by admitting a State who, having joined the entente, might play thegame  of Berlin and Rome.   The best line of approach to Bulgaria was througheconomic questions; and it was for that reason  that he had invited a Bulgarianrepresentative to  the  Economic Conference which opened at Bucharest on the17th May.  His Majesty&apos;s Government could help if they would let it be known that they  thought it a  good thing  for Bulgaria to send a representative.   he did not wish to close the door to an entente with Bulgaria.  The Balkan states were all different each from the other, yet they were compelled by history andgeography to collaborate. The important thing was to promote the idea of Balkanunity.    M. Gafencu  then referred to  an idea  which he had  ventilated  in Londonsix months earlier, namely, the construction of a north-south road from Warsawthrough Bucharest and Sofia to Salonika.  This would help to create a community of interest among the Eastern European States.  Poland and Bulgaria alreadyshowed a tendency to draw together.  The proposed road would not pass throughGerman territory, and since it would reach the sea at Salonika, it would open upEastern Europe to the maritime Powers.  There was at present  no bridge acrossthe Danube between  Roumania and Bulgaria.  The  Polish and RoumanianGovernments were both  studying the project, and M. Gafencu had mentioned itto Sir F. Leith-Ross.    Lord  Halifax said  he  gathered from what M. Gafencu had said that theRoumanian  Government had not  closed their  eyes  to the possibility of some political arrangement with Bulgaria, but they felt that, before this question couldbe properly examined, there must be good progress towards Balkan unity.  they considered the best initial approach was in the economic field, and they had to be assured that Bulgaria would not play a, double game.    M. Gafencu said  he was worried about Yugoslavia.  If Belgrade turned to rome and Berlin, the Balkan combination would be lost.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment  had great influence with the Prince  Regent;  could he not  be invited toLondon 1                   (The meeting adjourned at  12-30 P.M.)SECOND MEETING (in the Prime Minister&apos;s room at the House of Commons,                          on April 24, at 4 P.M.).                                 Present:        Mr. Chamberlain (Prime Minister).        Lord Halifax (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).        Sir A. Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State).        Mr. Ingram (Foreign Office).        Mr. Strang (Foreign Office).        M. Gafencu (Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs).        M. Tilea (Roumanian Minister  in London).Conversations in  Berlin: Roumanian-German relations.    The Prime Minister said that M. Gafencu had told him during luncheon ofhis conversations in Germany.  Had he anything more to say on the subject?
     M. Gafeitcu then outlined briefly the purport of his conversations with Herr Hitler, Herr von Ribbentrop and Field-Marshal Goring, as recounted  to Lord Halifax that morning.   The following new points emerged:-     Herr Hitler told him that he thought the Germans had made a mistake in 1914 in going through Belgium in order to widen their front.  Herr Hitler also said that he had told Count Csaky that the Germans in Roumania were better off there than  they would be  if they were  transferred to Hungary, and he had  no intention of supporting Hungarian claims against Roumania.  M. Gafencu said that, of course, when Herr Hitler said this he had in mind a friendly Roumania. Herr Hitler had also said that he had  nothing to say against  an Anglo-French guarantee to Roumania; but he  had added that, if  this were linked up with Russia, the position would be changed.   In Herr Hitler&apos;s view, Great  Britain, France and Germany, whatever their differences, had a common interest in saving Europe.   The Soviet Union was a danger,  not only to Germany  but to Europe as a whole.     The Prime Minister said he gathered  therefore  that Herr Hitler&apos;s dislike and fear of Russia had not diminished.     M. Gafencu said this was so.  It was,  of course, possible that Herr Hitler had used this language about Russia as a means of pressure upon himself.  He had intimated that,  if the Roumanian Government based  their system upon Russia, Germany would have to regard this as an unfriendly attitude towards herself. Herr Hitler also indicated  that the Polish-Roumanian  alliance suited his book. It was, in his view, a European alliance which might be useful in stemming  the Russian advance.     Field-Marshal Goring had been more categorical about the Russian question, and had seemed to be trying to  use the language of intimidation.  Herr von Ribbentrop, on the other hand, had been unexpectedly amiable. It was  clear to M. Gafencu that Herr Hitler and Herr von Ribbentrop had concerted together the line to be taken in the conversations.     M. Gafencu went on to explain that the Germans had no need to insist on the Russian question with him.  He had explained to them that Roumania had,  of necessity,  to maintain contact with Great Britain and France, but she had never based her security system upon the Soviet  Union.  He recalled that M. Titulescu had tried to do what M. Benes had done, namely, to base his security system upon Russia, but that this was  the cause of M.  Titulescu&apos;s  fall.  This was  not the policy of the present Roumanian Government,  the  Roumanian King or the Roumanian people. An agreement with Russia might lead  Roumania where she did not want to go.  Roumania preferred to confine her political connexions  to those States whose conception  of peace was the same as her own.  This was not so with Soviet Russia.     The Prime Minister asked whether M.  Gafencu had given his views about Russia to Mr. Attlee.     M. Gafencu said he had had an opportunity of doing so at some length with Mr. Dalton and Mr. Henderson.   Mr. Dalton had  urged the importance  of linking up  with Soviet  Russia for  the  sake of peace, but M.  Gafencu had retorted that  the word &quot; peace&quot;  did not always mean the same thing in the minds of those who  used it.  His own  view was that, if war was certain,  he would  not  care  who helped him;  but if  there were  a  5  per  cent, chance  of peace, he did not wish to jeopardise it by associating with a country in whom he had no confidence.    The Prime Minister asked whether there had been any tendency in Berlin to press him further on the economic agreement between Germany and Roumania.    M. Gafencu replied that so far there had been no  pressure.  They must nowwait and  see.  When  the  agreement had been  signed,  a  Grand  Council had laid down the line on  which Roumania would have to stand and resist.  TheRoumanian-German  economic agreement  was  nothing more  than a plan  of collaboration,  designed  to  increase the economic  exchanges between the twocountries.   It  was necessary now to wait and see how it would be executed.    M. Gafencu had spoken to Sir F. Leith-Ross about this in  Brussels, andhad promised  that on  his  arrival  in Bucharest he would  be informed  of thepoints on which Roumania was determined  to resist.      [19106]                                                  c 2
    The agreement was an economic and not a political one, and Roumania wishedto make it clear  to Germany that she was ready  loyally to  satisfy  Germany &apos;sneeds under the agreement on a reciprocal  basis.  But there were certain limits which must not be passed, otherwise Roumania would slip into the control  ofthe closed economy area.  At the same time it would be desirable to  make clearthat the economic exchanges which Roumania  would have with Great Britainand France were not designed  to shut Germany out.    When he had seen  Sir F. Leith-Ross in Brussels, the latter had spoken  ofa plan for an international holding company, which would centralise exchangesbetween W.  and  E. Europe.   Something  of this kind  was plainly desirable.It was  important for the Western Powers  to do what  they could to maintainRoumaniia&apos;s economic independence, though this should be  done  on a  purelyeconomic,  and not on a political, basis.  In any event, it was necessary to proceedwith great prudence.Poland..&quot;    Mr. Chamberlain  asked whether M.   Gafencu had the impression  thatGermany  had for the time being decided  not  to make  a  further push  in thedirection  of  Roumania.    M.  Gafencu replied  that he  did not think the push would be in that direction.The next  push would be towards Poland  and towards  Danzig in  particular.There would also  be a push for the colonies,  probably in concert with the Italians.Germany  would risk a great deal if a conflict arose with Poland, since in that event  she  could not be sure of  Italian support.  Therefore she would  probablyrun some other hare at the same time in conjunction with the Italians,  in order tomake sure that the latter came in.    M.  Gafencu  was convinced  that Herr Hitler  would speak of  Danzig  onthe 28th April. Herr Hitler had said three times to M. Gafencu that  the Danzigquestion must be settled.  Herr  von Ribbentrop had also said the same thing.    M.  Gafencu  repeated to  Mr.  Chamberlain the account he had  given  toLord Halifax at the morning session of Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals to Poland aboutDanzig  and the Corridor.    Mr. Chamberlain asked whether Herr  Hitler had asked Poland  to join the anti-Comintern Pact.    M.  Gafencu  did not think  so, nor did  he think that Poland would join.Soviet Union.    M.  Gafencu said he would  be grateful if he could be  told about the progressof our negotiations with the Soviet Government.  He had had a certain amountof information from M. Bonnet through the Roumanian Ambassador in Paris.He would be glad if Lord Halifax could supplement this.                 ,  .    Lord Halifax said  that His Majesty&apos;s Government were  sensible  of thedifficulty  of reconciling  two points of view, both of which  had to be taken inlrraccount.  On the one hand His Majesty&apos;s  Government  were conscious that  incase of trouble it might well be that  Roumania  and Poland would be glad tohave Russian assistance.  That being so, it was desirable not to  cold-shoulderSoviet Russia too much.  His Majesty&apos;s Government also had the domestic aspectto consider, since many  members of the Opposition considered that if only  anagreement could  be made with  Russia everything would  be all right.    On the other hand  it was  necessary to have regard  to what we  knew to bethe hesitation of Poland and to what we believed  to be the hesitation  of roumania.    After the guarantees had been given to  Roumania by  Great Britain andFrance an approach was made to the Soviet Government.  The difficulties werepointed out  to them  and it was suggested that  the Soviet  Government  mighton their  own initiative  make a declaration on the lines of  a recent speech  byStalin in  which he had  defined Russian policy as being that of assisting  victims of aggression  who were willing to defend themselves.  Could not the SovietGovernment, without asking any questions, say that if  Roumania and  Polandwanted assistance from the Soviet Government they would be willing to  give it:This  would be a unilateral declaration made in the same  way as  our  own.
     Lord Halifax hoped that  this proposal  did  not  embarrass  the Roumanian Government.     The Soviet Government  had replied by putting forward a  detailed scheme which was now being studied.  One of the essential elements in this scheme was that France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union should make a definite agree- ment to give support to all countries lying between the Baltic and Black Seas. No reply had yet been given to this proposal, but it presented great difficulties. If such a proposal were accepted, we should be forcing Poland and Roumania into an  embarrassing position.     His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would probably answer the Soviet proposal by saying that something of this kind might be worth considering  at a later date, but  that in present  circumstances  it  would create  difficulties which they were seeking to  avoid.  We would therefore ask them to reconsider the proposal we had put to  them.     M. Gafencu asked whether he could discuss this question with M. Bonnet.     Lord Halifax replied that there would  be  no  objection to  this,  since our proposed reply  had already been submitted to  the French Government; but, apart from this, he hoped that M. Gafencu would keep this information confidential.     M. Gafencu said the danger was that, if any  large scheme of this kind were elaborated,  the German  Government would certainly say  that Poland  and Roumania could no longer be  regarded as friends of  Germany.  He himself could not trust the Soviet Government.  It was true that the Soviet Government would defend Soviet territory; at the same time, their object was still world revolu- tion.  It was impossible to be sure which-of these two ideas would gain the upper hand.  They ought not to be  cold-shouldered; but it would he dangerous&quot;&quot;*to give the impression  that there was any intimate collaboration with them.  They did not use the word &quot;peace &quot; in the same sense as other Governments of Europe.     M. Gafencu thanked Lord Halifax  for the information he  had given and agreed with the line His Majesty&apos;s Government were taking.     Lord Halifax asked whether it would be embarrassing to M. Gafencu if, when it became necessary to say something in public, he were to say that too close collaboration with the  Soviet Government would be embarrassing to Roumania.     M. Gafencu replied that this would give pleasure in Berlin, but it would not be so well  received in Moscow.  But it ought to be possible to find words which would not do  any harm  anywhere.     The  Prime Minister  asked whether it was M. Gafencu&apos;s view that  open association  with the Soviet Union, by Great  Britain or Roumania or Poland, would introduce a dangerous element into the situation and might precipitate dangerous action by Germany.    M. Gafencu  replied that this  was what  he  feared,  and it  was a fear of King Carol also.  On the other  hand, it was dangerous to be at enmity with the Soviet Union.  The best thing  was not to  trust  them or to make arrangements with them which might be held  to imply that  we trusted them.    He suggested that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to say something in public  about Roumania&apos;s attitude  towards Russia, they might say that thepolicy of  Roumania was not to lean  upon one strong neighbour against the otherstrong neighbour.  The differences between  the German and Soviet governments were based  on  matters  of  doctrine which  had nothing to do with Roumania.Roumania  would not  join with Germany against Russia  or  join  the Anti- Comintern  Pact; nor  would she  join with  Russia  against Germany.  The important  thing  was  to have  equilibrium  in  Europe.   This   was  the  truesignificance  of the Franco-British guarantee.to Poland and Roumania.    Lord Halifax said that it had been suggested to him that Herr Hitler wassincerely  concerned  about the question of  encirclement, and  that he would bereassured if it could be said in London that if Germany were attacked by Russiaor Poland His Majesty&apos;s Government would go to the support of  Germany.  He did not think that there was much value in  this idea.    M. Gafencu agreed.        ,                            ... .  ,  ,
 Yugoslavia...     M. Gafencu said that he hoped to visit Belgrade on  his way back.  He;wondered whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could not bring influence to bear on the Prince Regent, since anything His Majesty&apos;s Government might say might be decisive.  He had just received a telegram informing him that His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Belgrade had  reported to the Foreign Office that he had received a formal assurance from the Yugoslav Government that the  Yugoslav Government would not allow themselves to  be  drawn into any  combination  against  Great Britain.     Lord Halifax said that when the Prince Regent had last been in London he had begged His Majesty&apos;s Government  never to believe  (no matter what they might hear)  that  Yugoslavia would follow any policy directed  against  Great Britain.     He had not yet received any report from His Majesty&apos;s Minister in the sense of M. Gafencu&apos;s telegram.     M. Gafencu said that perhaps after all nothing very  serious had happened in, Venice; but if Yugoslavia  threw in her lot with Italy, the Balkan Pact was finished.  This would be a pity since the Balkan Entente was a useful thing.     He thought there were two possibilities.  Perhaps the  Italians were thinking of an agreement between Italy, Yugoslavia and Hungary, which, though it might be directed against the Balkan Entente, would equally be designed as a reinsurance against Berlin.  On the other hand, Italy might merely be  acting as the agent of Germany, facilitating  her advance into the Balkans.     Lord Halifax asked what action could be taken to strengthen the attitude Of Yugoslavia.     M. .Gafencu thought that if His Majesty&apos;s Government could give Yugoslavia a guarantee,  this might help.  Had His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that the Yugoslav Government would refuse ?     Lord Halifax replied that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not approached the Yugoslav Government.  They had thought that such an approach  might perhaps&apos;be embarrassing; but they had deliberately not taken any decision until they had had a chance of talking to M. Gafencu.i&apos;    M. Gafencu feared that perhaps it was now too late.   M. Stoyadinovitch had told him three months ago that Yugoslavia would be with Roumania; but he could not say so in public.   M. Gafencu had tried at Easter to  organise a meeting of the Balkan Entente at Istanbul, but the Yugoslavs had not been willing  to go.irPhat was why he would stop at Belgrade on his way home.  He  proposed also to visit Rome on the way.     M. Gafencu said  that while he was in Brussels he  had found that King Leopold was anxious about the international situation, and  had wondered whether he and King Carol could not organise  a conference of  the smaller  European countries; the Balkan  bloc,  the Baltic bloc, the Scandinavian countries, Belgium and Holland, and perhaps also  Spain and Portugal.  The conference would be called for economic purposes,  but  it might also issue an appeal for peace in Europe.     M. Gafencu said that he had promised to speak to King Carol on his return. The idea seemed to him a good one, but somewhat risky!  Great Britain  and France might view it with sympathy, but other  Powers would sabotage it.  He asked that if  any approach  was made to His Majesty&apos;s  Government on  the subject they  would let him know what they thought.     The Prime Minister enquired whether M. Gafencu did not think that such.a: step would again be regarded as encirclement.     M. Gafencu concurred, but qualified the encirclement as a  peaceful one. Arms for Roumania.     M. Gafencu said that he wished to ask about the supply of arms to Roumania, This is an important question, since it was desirable that Roumania should be as strong as possible as soon as possible.   She had plenty of  men  and  they were imbued with a fine spirit;  but Roumania needed to complete her armaments.  A list had  been submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government together with the request
for credits.  The sum involved would be about  10  million.  He would ask HisMajesty&apos;s Government to consider this application and give their  reply.   Thequestion  was most important for Roumania.  The Polish and Roumanian armies,if well equipped, would be a strong barrier.    Lord Halifax said he thought the position was as follows.  The lists hadbeen examined.  His Majesty&apos;s Government fully realised how  desirable it wasthat everything  possible should be done to help to equip the Roumanian army.But at the present moment, when our own forces  were being  re-equipped, wedoubted  whether, with  the best will  in the world, we  could immediately  giveRoumania anything nearly approaching all that she wanted. In some items, covering-all three services, we  could help.  The best thing would perhaps be  for  theRoumanian  Service Attaches to  place themselves  in  contact with  our  service departments and go into the details.  He  hoped  that  M. Gafencu would  notbe too disappointed.  For the present, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not  helpvery much, but perhaps later on  they could help more.                      ; 1    M. Gafencu expressed his disappointment but agreed to this procedure.                      (The meeting adjourned at 5 P.M.)                      &apos;THIRD MEETING (in the Secretary of State&apos;&apos;s Room at the Foreign Office, on                          April 25&apos;, at  3-45 P.M.)                         Present :Lord Halifax (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).Sir A. Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State).Mr. Ingram (Foreign Office).Mr. Strang (Foreign Office).M. Gafencu (Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs).M. Tilea (Roumanian Minister in London).Yugoslavia.    M. Gafencu repeated that he thought it would be a good thing if the PrinceRegent could come to London.    Lord Halifax said that perhaps M. Gafencu would sound him and see what he thought.  He might tell Prince Paul that, if he liked to come here,  there wouldbe no difficulty from our side.  If the suggestion came direct from London, PrincePaul might perhaps feel some embarrassment.    M. Gafencu agreed  that  it was better  that  there should be no  directinvitation from London.  He would put the matter to the Prince Regent, speakingas a Balkan  friend and ally.  It was  better for the Balkans that there shouldbe equilibrium  amongst the Great Powers.  The Balkan Entente must have ahindependent  policy,  but above all  it  must not move  with the Axis  Powers.Independence meant, in fact,  an understanding with Paris and London,  sinceParis and London had no demands to make on the Balkan Entente.   The Britishand French guarantee was important from this point of view, in time of peace aswell as in time of war.  It had put an end to the idea which had become prevalentafter  Munich  that  Great Britain and France  had abandoned Eastern  andSouth-Eastern  Europe  to  Germany.   This was  the line  which M.  Gafencuproposed to develop  at  Belgrade.  He would urge that  it was the  duty of the yugoslav  Government   to  make it clear  that  they had not been  completelycaptured by  the Axis Powers.   He was certain that neither  Prince Paul norYugoslav opinion would be in  favour  of doing anything  against  Great Britain.M. Gafencu knew that, after the British guarantee had been given to Roumania,there was a good  deal of heart-searching in Yugoslavia on the  question whetherYugoslavia had herself  followed the right policy.
 . .,   Sir, A. Cadogan suggested that M. Gafencu might find out from Prince Paul whether he would like an invitation from us, or whether he would like to come on his own.     M. Gafencu said he would advise him to come without an invitation.  If we were to invite him, it would be said that he had  no alternative but  to accept. It would be better that he should come on his own  initiative,  as M. Gafencu himself had done.     It was better, in any event, that Prince Paul should come than the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, since the Regent was  at the present moment his own Foreign Minister. Turkey..     M. Gafencu said that Turkey was  most important  from the point of view of Great Britain as well as from the point of view of Roumania.  He felt certain that the German Government were  going to use great efforts to establish their influence in  Angora.   Herr  von Papen still   had considerable  prestige as a diplomat.  It was important for the other Powers to concentrate their diplomatic activities at Angora.   The Turks,  it was true, were not a volatile people and did not easily change their minds, but  it  was desirable for  the other Powers to continue to manifest their  interests in Turkey by visits,  &amp;c.     Lord Halifax said he was quite  alive to this consideration.  The  more that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the  Roumanian Government could do to show their interest in the political and economic sphere, the better.     M. Gafencu said that he had visited Istanbul at Easter and was going on an official visit in May.     Lord Halifax, raised a point in connexion  with the  notes(1) which had been drawn up as a result of M. Gafencu&apos;s  recent conversation  with the Turkish Foreign Minister.     In point (3)  of these notes,  it was said that if events should impose on Roumania or Turkey the necessity of making a  choice or of taking up  a definite position as between the two groups of Powers, it was  understood  that Roumania and Turkey would act  in common and would insist that their allies of the Balkan Entente  should join the group which was organising itself against domination.     On the other hand, in point (5) it was said that in a case where, in accordance with point (3),  Roumania was forced to undertake military action, and  if Turkey were  to  remain either temporarily or permanently outside the conflict, it was understood that Turkey would maintain a benevolent neutrality.    There appeared to be some conflict between these two statements.    M. Gafencu explained that, of course, these notes did not constitute  an agree- ment, but were merely an unofficial record of what  had occurred.  The meaning- was that the two Powers would do their best to be on the same side, but it might well be that Roumania would enter the conflict before  Turkey, and, if so, Turkey would be a  benevolent neutral.   The important thing to  note was that  in  no event would the two Powers find themselves in  opposite camps.  But they could not be sure that in all  circumstances  they would participate actively in the same camp.  Roumania might be involved  in a war which  Turkey did not enter, but in that event  Turkey would  be in  sympathy  with Roumania.   The notes  in question did not  constitute an agreement or an alliance;  they merely recorded a conversation between  the two Ministers  of friendly countries, and did nothing- more than state the principles which would govern the  foreign policy of  those two countries.    Lord Halifax thought they might be defined as an approach of sympathetic minds.    M. Gafencu agreed they were an attempt to  base  the  policy of the two countries on the same principles.A nglo-Turkish  Conversations.    Lord Halifax alluded  to  the  discussion on the previous day on  a matterconnected with our conversations with the  Turkish  Government.   He had spoken of a formula which was under negotiation with the Turkish Government,                             (!) See page 2 above.
the object of  which was to define  the  attitude of the two  countries in theevent of an act of aggression leading to war in the Balkans or the Mediter-ranean.  He was not sure whether he had made  it clear to M. Gafencu that hehad  informed  the Turkish Government that if such a formula could be  found(and he did not think this would be very difficult) His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared  to enter into reciprocal engagements  with Turkey.    He wished to add, also, that  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had suggested that if the formula couldbe agreed upon with the Turkish Government it might be agreeable to the latter to give  the arrangement some more permanent form.  If  that were the Turkishview, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be quite agreeable.  He hoped that what his  Majesty&apos;s Government were doing  with the Turkish Government  would contribute to the solidarity of the Balkan Powers.    M. Gafencu was glad to hear what Lord Halifax had just said.  So  far asTurkey was concerned, Roumania had no reserves to make. He hoped that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would succeed in their efforts, and if, when he went to turkey in May, he could help, he would do so.Poland.    M.  Gafencu  said he had seen the Polish  Ambassador in London and  had repeated to him what  he  had told Lord Halifax about his conversations withM. Beck.  Count Raczynski had been in complete agreement with that statement,namely, that he and M. Beck had reached an agreement as to the interpretation of the Polish-Roumanian Treaty, and that further technical arrangements wouldbe negotiated  at  some  appropriate moment.   Count Raczynski  would make astatement to this effect on behalf of the Polish  Government to Lord Halifax.    Lord Halifax enquired whether Count Raczynski had any more to say aboutPolish-German relations, with particular reference to Danzig.    M. Gafencu said that he had not.    Lord Halifax asked whether M. Gafencu himself thought  there was  any solution to be  found for the Danzig  problem.   To put the point bluntly, did hethink M. Beck was being unreasonable or not ?    M. Gafencii replied that it was difficult to say.    Lord Halifax said that M. Gafencu had well described on the previous day the respective  positions occupied by the Polish and German Governments.  ThePoles wished to preserve the international status of the Free City, but at the sametime they were prepared to give the Germans in Danzig every right  and even,perhaps, to surrender their responsibility for  Danzig&apos;s foreign relations.   TheGermans, for their part, were prepared to give Poland extensive rights within aGerman city.    M. Gafencu said that in the Danzig question two German principles were in conflict with each other, namely, the national and ethnic principle on the one handand the principle of Lebensraum on the other.  There was no doubt that Danzigfell within Poland&apos;s Lebensrmim, though at the same time there was no doubt  thatit was ethnically a GeiTnan city.    He had spoken to M. Beck in  Warsaw  about Danzig and  had  suggestedthat,  as Danzig  was undoubtedly a German city,  Poland might  perhaps besatisfied if Germany left  her the Corridor and  Gdynia.   M. Beck&apos;s reply  wasthat Danzig was a capital question for Poland.  It was, first of all, a great portrand  for every 10 tons  of  Polish commerce that  passed through  Gdynia 7  tonspassed through Danzig.  It was also a nodal  point  of communications.  OtherPoles to whom M. Gafencu had spoken had taken the same view and it was likely that the Polish Government would be very stiff on  this question.    M. Tilea  recalled that Herr Hitler had said that he would  not repeat theproposal he had made, to M. Beck.  If so, there was likely to be a deadlock.    M. Gafencu  said that  this  was so  and  he  had reported in this sense toKing Carol.    Lord Halifax thought that,  if German assurances were to be believed  (butthis  was a large  hypothesis), it  ought not to be impossible to reconcile Polishclaims with German sovereignty,  if  Germany guaranteed Poland all the  rights to which she was entitled.
    M. Gafencu thought that Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal was not altogether unreason-able in itself.  But it would only be a first step, and once Germany was master of Danzig further steps would follow.    Lord Halifax said it was clear that  M. Beck  did not believe the Germanassurances.    M. Gafencu said  that  that was  why he had suggested  that the  germans should be told they must quit Prague before any concessions could be made.  Itwas dangerous  to  make  further concessions  to  Germany,  even though  thoseconcessions might be based on justice, if Germany paid no  price or gave  no compensation.   Every crisis produced&apos; by  Germany ought  to cost  Germanysomething.  To make this demand  of Germany would merely be following theGerman  technique; it  was the German way to make violent  threats and yet atthe same time to leave the door ajar.   There was a good deal to be learnt fromHerr Hitler in the matter of diplomatic technique.  After all, Napoleon himself had been defeated  when his own ideas on strategy and tactics had  been  used against him.   Herr Hitler had said again and  again that his achievements hadbeen  secured without  shedding a drop of blood, and  this was the key to hismethods.    Lord Halifax agreed generally  with M. Gafencu&apos;s  analysis, but he found itdifficult  to believe  that,  however loudly the Germans  might  be  asked to  quitPrague,  Hitler could possibly be brought to comply.    M. Gafencu said that,  if Hitler  was placed  in that position, he could notlegitimately ask for Danzig or the colonies.    Lord Halifax asked whether his answer would not  be that he had never, forexample, coerced President Hacha.    M. Gafencu said that, if that was so, President Hacha had behaved like a criminal.Bulgaria.    Lord Halifax said that he had  been reflecting about the question of Balkanunity, with special reference to Bulgaria, and had a point to put to M. Gafencu.    His  Majesty&apos;s Government had undertaken commitments towards roumania and Greece, and they  were therefore concerned to  see that, if any war shouldbreak out, the chances of success  should be as great as possible.  That was thefundamental  justification for the  importance  which was attached to Balkanunity. Here Bulgaria was, of course, the key point.  The Turkish  Governmentwere  in  a better position than any  other member of the Balkan Entente  toexercise pressure and persuasion upon Bulgaria, if only because Bulgaria had noclaims against Turkey. The Turkish Government, Lord Halifax understood, were of the same  mind,  and were,  he  thought, disposed to  approach the bulgarian government and the Governments of  the other members of the Balkan Ententewith  the object  of trying to secure  the entry of Bulgaria  into the entente.   Hewas not  aware  whether  the Turkish  Government  had in  fact made  any  firm proposals at Bucharest, and, if so, in  what terms.    The question then arose that if the main object were at least the neutralisa-tion of Bulgaria in the event of war, what were the lines on which this could beachieved %    There seemed to be three alternatives :     (1) To leave Bulgaria to her own  devices, and trust that she would not make          the same mistake as she  made in the last war.    (2) (This was the plan developed by M. Gafencu on the previous day.)  To          start with Bulgaria in the sphere of economics and communications,          without raising awkward questions,  like the question of frontiers.    (3) To try to attract Bulgaria  to the side of the Western Powers and the          Balkan Entente, even at  the price of some concession or sacrifice.    Having given their recent guarantees,  His Majesty&apos;s Government had under-taken risks which might involve heavy sacrifices, and they felt therefore that  thevhad some right to discuss this question.    He  wanted to ask how the Roumanian Government assessed  the relativeclangers  to their security from Hungary and from Bulgaria.   If Roumania were
to grant some conditional concession to Bulgaria, would that  be the immediateoccasion for a corresponding claim by Hungary&apos;?  If it was thought possible toavoid any such reaction from Hungary, it might perhaps be argued that such aconditional concession to Bulgaria might be in the best interests of Roumania andof Balkan unity.    On the other hand, again, if such a  concession to Bulgaria were likely to precipitate action by Hungary, would it  be a  feasible policy to do nothing asregards Bulgaria until the immediate Hungarian threat was to emerge, and then to buy off Bulgaria  and take a firm stand  against Hungary.  If this course wasadopted, if might bring it home to Hungary that if threats were offered therewould be no concessions, but if there were no threats,  concessions might follow.    Lord Halifax asked whether he was correct in defining M. Gafencu&apos;s finalthought as being that M. Gafencu was  not  at  present  in  any circumstancesdisposed to consider the wisdom of making additional concessions to Bulgaria.Lord Halifax  fully  appreciated the  dangers of making  concessions,  but  hewas  also sensible of the clangers on the other side.   This  was, of  course, not primarily the business of His Majesty&apos;s  Government,  but  the business of theRoumanian Government and of the Balkan Powers.  He wished to ask whether,if M.  Gafencu proceeded  with Bulgaria on the lines  he  had suggested on theprevious day (i.e.0 in the  sphere of economics  and communications),  and if he found that this approach was not likely to succeed, there was any  possibility of going any further along the path of concession.     M. Gafencu said that before he left Bucharest there had been a meeting ofMinisters and Royal Counsellors, presided over by the  King to examine current problems.  The Bulgarian question had been most carefully examined.  It was of great importance to reinforce the Balkan Entente and  to transform it into asingle bloc.  If it were possible to bring Bulgaria into the bloc, there was a possi-bility that the bloc might gain in  consistency.  It was not, however, a purelyarithmetical problem.  It was not necessarily true to say that five countries werestronger than four.   It was  a political problem also.  The question was, was the fifth country determined in all circumstances to march in step with the rest 1  Ifthey brought in a fifth country which had connexions  outside the Entente andpursued a policy out of harmony with the rest, the Entente would not gain in strength.  The Greek Government thought there was hardly anything to be done about  Bulgaria;  the  more the Bulgarian Government received, the  more they wanted.  It suffered from a kind of megalomania.   General Metaxas said thatif he thought any Roumanian Minister was considering concessions to Bulgaria,he would go straight to Bucharest and advise them against it.  The general didnot think that the Bulgarian Government  was sincere.     M. Gafencu said that he himself always tended to admit the good faith of others.   He had  done so in the case of Hungary over the Ruthenian question,and the only result  was that Hungary  had  kept  an army mobilised  on theRoumanian frontier.     He felt that both Bulgaria and Hungary  were strongty subject to Germanand Italian propaganda.     In view of all this, the Roumanian Government had come to a clear decision not to make, or speak of,  territorial concessions.  To do so would  be dangerous to their policy of resistance.  They could not be confident that Bulgaria wouldbecome a friend and ally all at once. To admit her in these circumstances would weaken  the Balkan Entente.  At present, the  members of the Balkan Ententewere unanimous in  their determination to defend the Entente against Bulgaria.If Roumania were  attacked by Hungary  or Germany,  the Turkish Governmenthad told the Bulgarian Government that  they  would mobilise and would see toit that Bulgarian troops  did not enter into Roumania.  He believed that theGreek Government  had said the same thine.   The situation was  not the  sameas it was in 1914, because this time Roumania would  have Turkey on her sideinstead of against her.     If he had explained the situation in  this way,  he did not want to saythat it was his final word.  He wished to examine the situation in agreement withthe  Turkish Foreign Minister.   The  Turkish Government had not  made anyembarrassing  proposals  to  the  Roumanian  Government.   They  had  merelyproposed that the two Governments should together study the Bulgarian problem and see what it might be possible to do with the  Bulgarian Government.   Thelatest idea of the Turkish Foreign Minister had been to try to create an external

He believed  that theGreek Government  had said the same  thing.

If he had explained the situation in  this way,  he did not want to saythat it was his final word. He wished to examine the situation in agreement withthe  Turkish Foreign Minister.   The  Turkish  Government  had  not made anyembarrassing  proposals  to  the  Roumanian  Government.  They  had merelyproposed that the two Governments should together  study the Bulgarian problem and see what it might be possible to do with the  Bulgarian Government.   Thelatest idea of the Turkish Foreign Minister had been to try to create an external
frontier of the Balkan Entente, leaving open the possibility of political arrange-.ments on internal matters between the partners and friends who were members ofthe entente, and who had proved their good faith and their spirit of unity.  TheRoumanian Government were  perfectly ready to  study  this question, but they thought it wise to take one step at a time,  and they thought it best  to start witheconomic matters.    M. Gafencu said that he would report  to his Government what Lord Halifaxhad. said  and what  he himself had replied.  He would  study the Bulgarianquestion further in Rome,  and  listen to what the Italian  Government had to say.Of course they were working  against the Balkan Entente.  He would make  itclear that Roumania firmly adhered to the  entente and that if any Power workedagainst the entente they were  working against Roumania.  He would see  whatthe Italian Government  had   to say.  Prince Paul thought  that  Italy and bulgaria were in close association.    M. Gafencu  said he  would also  see  how matters  stood in Belgrade.  IfYugoslavia were to stand outside the entente, it was no  use making any conces-sions to Bulgaria. In that eArent Bulgaria would certainly be an enemy. ,   Lord  Halifax thought there was great force in  what M. Gafencu had said,and his arguments were very  strong.  It was no part  of the  purpose of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government to try   to press the Roumanian Government to  adoptmethods which they might think dangerous.    M. Gafencu said that he was glad to  know that Lord Halifax&apos;s sentimentswere like his own. It was necessary to try to do something with Bulgaria, but,while a good Bulgaria would be good for the entente, an uncertain Bulgaria wouldbe dangerous.  As things stood  at present Bulgaria could not do much harm, sinceshe was contained by Turkey, Greece and Roumania.    Lord  Halifax said he thought that M.  Gafencu&apos;s attitude  was a wise one.He was grateful for the frank explanations which M. Gafencu had given.    When he reported to King Carol he would not, Lord Halifax was sure, give him the impression that we were trying  to press the Roumanian  government against their better knowledge and  judgment.  But His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Roumanian  Government had a common purpose  in  view,  namely, thecreation of a single Balkan bloc.    M. Gafencu said that what he had heard from Lord Halifax  was  of  greatimportance.    Lord  Halifax said  that  there  was  one point which  should  always  beremembered.  It was part of German  technique to keep  everyone else in a stateof great uncertainty.  A few months ago the danger point  seemed to be Roumania;at another time it seemed to be  Holland and the Western Powers.  Now it seemedto be Danzig.  It might well be that in another month the danger point would besomewhere else.   The only  conclusion  to be drawn from German assurances,therefore,  was that it was necessary to be vigilant everywhere.    M. Tilea suggested that the joint danger points in the near future might wellbe Danzig and Yugoslavia.    M. Gafencu did not think  that Yugoslavia would be  a danger point just yet.So long as the Axis Powers thought that Yugoslavia  could be  used  as an instru-ment they would not try to weaken her.  When the time came they would probablytry to weaken her from within.  In  the same way so long as Roumania could beconsidered as  a  bulwark against Russia,  Germany  would probably  not try to weaken her.  Roumanian friendship with France and  Great Britain did notworry  Germany,  since  it enabled Roumania to be in a  strong position against russia. If, however, Roumania entered into close relations with Russia, germany would have a great interest in trying to weaken her.    Roumania must, therefore, maintain her friendship  with  France and GreatBritain and must say quite firmly that she  wished European equilibrium  to be preserved.  It was for that reason that when invited to  Berlin he had said thathe would come, but that he proposed also to visit London and  Paris.  Roumaniawould not make a policy with Germany against Russia, nor a policy with Russiaagainst Germany. This was the main principle of M. Gafehcu&apos;s foreign policy.If he abandoned this principle, he would lose his country.
Soviet Union.     Lord Halifax thought it would be useful  if M.  Gafencu, when  he was inParis, developed what  he had  said here  in London  about  the Soviet Union,because it  appeared that the French Government were anxious to secure  somecloser connexion with the Soviet Union than Roumania or Poland wanted.     .1/. Gafencu said that he was afraid that  this was so, and it was for thisreason that he  had asked the Roumanian Ambassador in Paris to meet him at Le Touquet on his way to London.  On the other hand, the Polish ambassador in London, who  had just, come back from Paris, said that the Polish ambassador in Paris reported that  M.  Bonnet  had given him  satisfactory assurances onthis  point, to the effect that France  would not accept the mutual  assistancepact proposed by the Soviet Government.     Lord Halifax said he would tell M. Gafencu, strictly for his own information,what the view of the French Government was.     The French Government recognised that the Polish and Roumanian Govern-ments would object to an agreement for Soviet assistance to those countries, director indirect.  They thought that the two countries would also object to a unilateral declaration by the Soviet Government of direct or indirect assistance.     -1/. Gafencu here interjected that the Polish Government had  informed him that they would not  accept  unilateral  declarations  from  anyone.  The PolishGovernment  would  only accept bilateral  arrangements,  and  with Russia nobilateral arrangements was possible.     Lord Halifax asked whether M. Gafencu  thought that the Polish Govern-ment would violently object if the Soviet Government said their assistance wouldbe available in the most convenient form if wanted.     M. Gafencu said that M. Beck  had told him that the German government felt  that if they attacked Poland they  would have Russia  against them as wellas Great Britain and France.  The conclusion he drew from  this was that evenin Poland there  was some feeling of the importance of Russian assistance.     Lord Halifax said  that his own view would be that any  statement  made bythe  Soviet Government should be general in  form,  and should be designed tootter assistance to any victim of aggression that defended itself.     M. Gafencu thought that this could do no harm to anyone.     Lord Hcdifax said  that the French Government also thought that the SovietGovernment would  insist on receiving an assurance that if the assistance whichwas  asked  of them exposed the Soviet  Union .to  an attack by Germany, GreatBritain and France would come to their help.  Their conclusion was  that  theremust therefore be an agreement of  mutual assistance between Great  Britain,France and Russia.     Lord  Halifax&apos;s reaction to this was that it did  not  fit in well with theobjections  raised by  the French Government  to any  arrangement  directly or indirectly affecting Poland  or Roumania,  since it  was obvious in the circum-stances contemplated that Russia could hardly afford effective help  to GreatBritain or France  without  indirectly  forcing her assistance upon Poland orRoumania,     M. Gafencu thought that too close an association with the  Soviet Governmentwould  be  embarrassing  to everyone  except the Germans.     Lord  Halifax  then read passages from a telegram  from His  Majesty&apos;ambassador at  Paris reporting  on  the French attitude.  In  the view of theFrench Government, agreement would only be possible on two  conditions.  Inthe first place, the agreement must only mention mutual and reciprocal engage-ments of assistance between the three Governments (Great Britain, France and russia) without naming any other State.   The formula proposed  to  the SovietGovernment must therefore be in terms wide enough not to indicate specificallythis  country  or  that, and  precise enough to apply,  nevertheless, to  the  most pressing and probable emergencies.  In the second place, the French GovernmentAvere also assured that the adherence of the Soviet Government to the immediateagreement  proposed could only be secured in so far as the Soviet Government
received an assurance that if the assistance which was asked of the Soviet Unionexposed the Soviet Union to  an attack by Germany, then France  and GreatBritain would come to their help.    The French Government therefore proposed a  Tripartite Agreement on thefollowing  lines :  (1)  If France and Great Britain found themselves at war  withGermany as a result of executing engagements taken by them in respect of Centralor Eastern Europe, Russia would immediately assist them.   (2) If,  as a resultof the help given by Russia to France  and Great Britain in the above conditions,Russia found  herself at  war with Germany, Great Britain and  France would immediately assist her.    Lord  Halifax&apos;s  comment on the second of these points  was that it seemedrather pointless, since  if  Great Britain and France were already at war  withGermany,  they could not be more at war with her, even in order to assist the SovietGovernment.                     -    M. Gafencu said that the French proposal seemed to  him to  be  for a largenew general Pact of  mutual assistance.  Such a Pact would not be very good forthe cause of peace.  If war broke out, everybody would be in,  and no doubt if theRussians wanted to help,  everybody would be glad to receive that help.   But ifthere was  a 20 per cent, chance  or a 10 per cent, chance of  saving peace, nothing should be  done to jeopardise it.    Lord  Halifax repeated that he thought it  would  be helpful if M. Gafencucould speak in this sense in Paris.    M. Gafencu promised to speak frankly.  He felt  it to  be his first  duty tohis country to make  every effort to save peace,  because if  war broke  out Russiaand Germany  might  fight on Roumanian territory.   If Germany won, Roumania-would be a vassal.  If Russia won, Roumania would be bolshevik.    In his view every friendly gesture made by Great Britain and  France helped the cause  of peace and established the equilibrium of the Powers.    Lord  Halifax said  that at the  same time  it  was desirable not  to estrangeRussia, but always to keep her in play.    M. Gafencu begged  that  nothing he  had said  about Russia  should  be disclosed.    He said that the German and Italian Governments had asked the  roumanian government to join  the Anti-Comintern Pact.  Roumania,  Turkey  and  Greecehad all refused;  he had urged the Yugoslav Government also to refuse.    It was  impossible for Roumania to follow a  policy with Russia  againstGermany.   If, on  the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government asked the SovietGovernment  to  make  a  unilateral  declaration,  without  mentioning  eitherRoumania or Poland, and using general phrases, he would  see no objection.    Lord  Halifax thought it would be quite enough  if the Soviet Governmentrepeated   Stalin&apos;s  statement,  with  special   reference  to  the commitments. HisMajesty&apos;s Government and France  had entered into  in Eastern  Europe.  TheSoviet Government would  not be called upon to give help to Roumania or Poland(if those  countries wanted it)  unless Great Britain  and  France were  alreadyinvolved.  It  would  be quite easy for the  Soviet Government to  play on  these terms if they wanted to.    M. Tilea  thought the Soviet Government were again anxious to  play a role in European politics.    M. Gafencu said he had. to admit that the Soviet Government  had been  goodneighbours,  and had not caused trouble.    He was most grateful for the  information which Lord Halifax had givento him.Hungary.    Lord Halifax asked what M. Gafencu  thought about Roumania&apos;s relationswith Hungary.    M. Gafencu replied that this depended on Germany.  He was  afraid thatGermany  held Hungary ready as a means of pressure against Roumania.  He didnot think, however, that  Germany would exercise such pressure  so  long asRoumania did not enter into close  relations with  Soviet Russia and so long as
 she could continue  to  be considered as  a bastion against  bolshevism.  If Roumania&apos;s  policy  changed in this respect, Germany  would  incite Hungary. against Roumania.    . He had  tried to achieve a detente with Hungary.  He had maintained good relations with the Hungarian minority in Roumania and had tried to bring their leaders into  the National  Front.  When the Hungarian Foreign Minister had recently made  disobliging remarks  about Roumania, the Hungarian minority leaders in Parliament had come to him to protest against Count Csaky&apos;s words. M. Gafencu had hoped to achieve the detente through the application of the Bled Agreement of August 1938.  This was an agreement between  the  three Little Entente Powers  and Hungary, by  which  (1)  the  Little Entente  recognised Hungary&apos;s right to  rearm;  (2)  Hungary agreed  to make  non-aggression agreements;  (3) the  Little  Entente made  a declaration  favourable to  their Hungarian minorities.  This  agreement was initialled,  but never signed or published.  It had been  drawn up during the Czech crisis,  and the  Hungarians saw very well that it could not be applied to Czecho-Slovakia,  but they did make a gentleman&apos;s agreement to apply it to Roumania and Yugoslavia, and, in fact, informed the Roumanian Government orally that they regarded  this  gentleman&apos;s agreement as being in force.  Unfortunately, after the Czech crisis they had tried to draw a distinction between Yugoslavia  and  Roumania no  doubt at Italy&apos;s instigation and showed signs of wishing for friendly relations  with Yugoslavia alone.     In the same way he had tried in  the Ruthenian question to prove  Roumania&apos;s friendship for  Hungary.  They did not oppose  the Hungarian occupation of Ruthenia  (though they  had taken up  a hostile attitude to  this in September last).  Unfortunately, the  Hungarian  Government did not  reciprocate, and had begun once again to cherish expansionist aspirations.  Mobilisation on one side had been followed by mobilisation on the other,  and in  place of assurances  the Hungarian Government had merely given evasive formulas.  It was only after Great Britain and France had given their guarantees, and possibly under pressure from Germany  (it was at the time  of his  visit  to Berlin)  that the Hungarian Foreign Minister made a declaration in Parliament, which, though only indirectly, expressed  the intention to respect Roumania&apos;s frontiers.     When he went to Rome and Belgrade he would see how things stood.   Italy was trying to improve relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia, and it might well be that  she would try  to improve relations between Hungary and Roumania. He was not  quite sure whether, in their Hungarian policy, Italy and Germany were following  quite the same line.   In any event, Roumania was willing to show her goodwill both in  the treatment of minorities, and on the question of non- aggression.  The Hungarian Government had indeed recalled that the gentleman&apos;s agreement at Bled still  existed.   When M.  Gafencu asked why in  that case it could not be signed and published, the Hungarian Government  had  replied that although it existed, they did not now agree with everything that was in it.     Lord  Halifax enquired whether  M. Gafencu had  any  new proposals  for dealing  with the Hungarian minority.  He recalled  that  M.  Comnene had mentioned certain schemes when he had come to this country with King Carol.     M. Tilea replied  that the arrangements reached at Bled wei&apos;e still in force.     M. Gafencu  admitted  that there were  still difficulties, particularly on  the question of  nationality.   If the minorities were not incited  from outside,  they would probably he content.  They were aware that the Roumanian  Government were willing to do  what they could.   In the relations  between Roumania and Hungary  the influence  of outside  Powers  was apt to intervene.   He  would therefore be interested  to see what the  Italian Government had to say  when he went to Rome.  He thought the Italian Government sincerely  desired a detente between Roumania and Hungary.     Lord Halifax thought this likely, since if there were trouble Germany would benefit more  than Italy. Yugoslavia.     M.  Tilea  read  a telegram  from  the  Roumanian  Minister  at Belgrade reporting on an interview which he had had, under instructions, with the Prince Regent.
    Prince Paul had categorically denied that there had been any discussionof  a  Yugoslav-Bulgarian-Hungarian  understanding.   He  had  declared  thatYugoslavia based her policy in the first place upon Yugoslavia^  relations with roumania and the other members  of the Balkan Entente.  This was a primaryinterest of Yugoslavia,  and it would be madness to  abandon it.  He asked theRoumanian  Government to rely upon  his loyalty, but he begged them to  take account of Yugoslavia^ difficulties.   There were Italian troops in  Albania;Germany  was a  neighbour;  and  Bulgaria was  unsafe.   There was  also thedifficulty of the internal question.  This was going quite well, but there were stilldifficulties, although concessions  had been made to the Croats.    The Prince Regent said that the proceedings at Venice had been satisfactory.Italy  had made  no new proposals, but had  insisted  on an improvement in therelations between Yugoslavia and Hungary within the framework of Yugoslavia^alliance with Roumania. It was difficult to see how  such an amelioration couldbe achieved, and  the Yugoslav Government  had no plan,  but  it was clear  theycould  only act in close accord with  the Roumanian Government.    As regards  Bulgaria,  Prince  Paul said he  had no  reason  to change hisopinion of King Boris&apos;s lack of sincerity.  He was astonished that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should pin their faith on King Boris after the experience of 1914.    As regards the general situation,  Prince Paul was very disturbed, but hothought that the  situation  would  be improved by the growing strength of theWestern Powers, by the attitude of America and by  the new arrangement with poland.    Prince Paul was indignant at  the news published in the Trench press aboutYugoslavia, which he said was quite inaccurate.    The Roumanian Minister in Belgrade also reported  that public opinion in yugoslavia was  moving towards  the Western  Powers.  The  situation  wasdisturbed and 120,000 more  men had been called up. There had been a manifesta-tion among the patriotic youth of the university, inspired by the General Staff.                    (The meeting  adjourned at 5-35 P.M.)FOURTH MEETING (in the Secretary of State&apos;s  Room at the Foreign Office,                        on  . 11nil 26, at 12-45 .P.M.)                                 Present:        Lord Halifax (Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs).        Sir A. Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State).        Mr.  Ingram  (Foreign Office).        M. Gafeucu  (Roumanian Minister for Foreign. Affairs).        M. Tilea (Roumanian  Minister in London).The Jewish Problem.    M. Gafencu said that he knew that M. Beck had discussed this question with theSecretary of State. M. Gafencu, too, had discussed the matter with M. Beck and theywere quite at one in their approach to the problem.  The  Roumanian attitude was to try and solve the difficulties on a basis of justice, but, at the same time, ona basis that would  distinguish between Jews who had been settled for a  long-time in the country and those who had only been recently settled.  For Roumaniathe Jewish problem was  of  the  utmost  importance.   One  of the  most  usefulweapons in Germany&apos;s  hands was the influence  of German policy with regardto the  Jews on the  large  numbers of  people in Eastern Europe  who held anti-Semitic views.  It had been a powerful weapon in the hands of the Iron Guard,and the Germans had not been  slow to use it to  the great danger of Roumania.Something had to be done to ensure that anti-semitism should not be pushed  toextremes,  and it was  the  conviction  of the Roumanian Government that everyeffort should be made  to fit the problem into a wider international frame.M. Gafencu repeated that for Roumania the  question was a capital question.
    Lord Halifax said that he quite appreciated this view and had not forgottenwhat  M.  Beck had said  on the subject.  The Palestinian question had  alsobrought His Majesty&apos;s  Government  face  to face with the problem.  They  hadbeen led to feel that the whole situation would be considerably eased if we could find some area in the  colonies  where  schemes  of agricultural and industrial activity on a large scale could be developed by an imported Jewish population.Recently a commission  of  Jews had  visited  British  Guiana  to investigate thematter.  The Governor  of British Guiana had just returned home and the corn-mission would  soon report.  From the preliminary impressions received  fromthe Governor, his Majesty&apos;s Government were not without hope that it mightbe possible to make a rather large contribution to the problem by  utilising theresources  of  British Guiana, and in that event  they hoped to be  able  to give to the questions of Polish and Roumanian Jews the place due to  them withinthe framework of the larger problem.    (At this stage, 1-20 P.M., the Secretary of State bade farewell to M. Gafencuand returned to the meeting with the Trades Union Council at No.  10, downing street.)Commamique.    The following communique was then agreed upon :           &apos;&apos; The visit of the Roumanian Foreign Minister to London has afforded    a  welcome opportunity for  an exchange of  views between His  Excellency    M. Gafencu  and the Prime Minister and Secretary of State  for Foreign    Affairs.   The  meetings  were characterised  by the utmost  frankness  and    cordiality on both sides and served to emphasise the general community of    outlook existing between the two Governments concerning current problems.&apos;&apos;A rmanients  for Roumania.    Sir Alexander Cadogan then reverted to the question of armaments.  Fromthe discussion which ensued it  appeared that there  had been some misunder-standing,  as, according to the  Roumanian Minister, his military  attache, onvisiting the War  Office, had gathered that  they had received no instructions from  the Foreign  Office to discuss the question of Roumanian armaments.  sir alexander understood  that these instructions had already been given verballyyesterday morning and  in writing yesterday  afternoon,  but he undertook to seethat all three Service Departments should be reminded at once that it was for themnow to discuss details with the  experts of the  Roumanian Legation.Bulgaria.    In reply to a specific enquiry by Sir  Alexander Cadogan,  M. Gafencu saidthat he would have no objection to our informing the Turkish Government through our Ambassador in Angora of his point of view regarding the Bulgarian problem.(The proceedings then closed.)
