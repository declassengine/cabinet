                                                   1 r: n     THE PRIME MINISTER said. that He had heenconsidering the whole problem, and. he thought thatthe difficulties felt, by some of his colleagues inregard to the scheme discussed in the Cabinet that afternoon would he met if  the proposed. MilitaryTraining and. Reserve Forces Eill were to be dividedinto two Bills:  a. Mobilisation of the Reserve and.Auxiliary Forces Bill, which could, be passed, into lawvery quickly:  and. a Military Training Eill, whichwould include such provisions as to requisitioning,etc., as might, be required in connection with the deployment of A.D.G.B. or  the calling up of the reserves .  He thought that it might, be wiser to drop the idea of introducing the Exceptional Powers(Defence) Eill at this juncture.     The essential features of this proposal were approved, by the Committee.     The following were the main points dealt with inthe course of the discussion which ensued..     Mobilisation of Reserve and. Auxiliary Forces.         It was agreed, that the present procedure inregard to mobilisation was cumbrous an&apos; antique, andthat amendment was clearly necessary.  Indeed, itwas thought that there was a. goo^ ca.se for a permanentAct  to  improve our methods of mobilisation on thelines propos,ed .     It was urged, that it  might be regarded assomewhat drastic to take the powers proposed inregard,  in particular, to  the personnel of theTerritorial Anti-aircraft  Hnits who had signed.individual undertakings to come out when called, upon by the Secretary o^ State  for ?ar in ca.se of imminentnational danger although a State of Emergency
                                                  1 f&quot; o                                                  I of ahad not been declared .     On the other hand., it was pointed out that thefa.ct that- it was necessary to take this somewhatextreme step would, make it. pro tanto ea.sier to  justifythe measure of compulsory military training proposed..     It was felt, however, that, the position in regard.to the auxiliary forces mad.e it desirable that  the mobilisation of Reserve and. Auxilia.ry Forces Eillshould not take the form of a permanent meaaure.     Duration of the  propos ed -Acts .        It was pointed out that if the proposal topa.ss the Exceptional  Powers (Defence) Bill into lawforthwith were abandoned., it was no longer possibleto make the other measures proposed dependent asrega.rds d.ura.t.ion on the currency of the powers  to begranted by the Exceptional Powers  (Defence) Bill.     Various alternatives were suggested.;  for  example,two yea.rs, or five years.     It was eventually decided, that the adoption of  a five-yee.r period, would, make it very difficult to getthe scheme accepted.  The period, should therefore be three years, with provision (a) to brins  the schemeto an end earlier by  Order in Council;  (b) for                                 for subsequent extension  of the period/a year at a.  time by    affirmative Resolutions of both Houses.     Powers of Requisitioning, etc.        Should these  powers be included in the  MilitaryTraining Bill, or in  the Mobilisation  of  the Res eweand. Auxiliary Forces  Bill?     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ;tfAR urge^ that  it was important to get these pavers as quickly  a.s possible,in order that he might make adequate arrangements forthe personnel of A.D.G.B. which would  be  called, out.     As against this  it was pointed, out. that if thepowers of requisitioning were included in the
Mobilisation of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Rillthere was some risk that the passage of the Bill wouldbe delayed while discussions took place in regard to compensation.,  Tt wa.s pointed out that it had. alwaysbeen intended that the provisions in regard to compensa-tion should not &quot;he introduced until after war had broken out, since it would then be much easier toobtain a. compensation scheme which would be satis fact-ory to the Exchequer,     Proposer1 Announcement on Wednesday and. Inti-oduc-tion of the Bills.        Stress was laid on the importance of theannouncement to be made on Wednesday covering bothBills.  It would also be desirable, if at all possible,that the Pills should he introduced together.   It was realised, however, that the Military Training Eillwould probably take longer to pass than the Mobilisa-tion or the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill.     Age Limits to be included in the Military Tra.iningBill.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR stressed theadvantages which would ensue from having wider age limits thon one year in the Pill. He suggested thatthe Bill should make statutory provision for calling up persons in a four-years a.ge group, but that anannouncement should be ma.de that i* was only intendedto call up one yea.r&apos;s age group.     In discussion it was felt thai this latitude wouldmake the Pill more difficult to ca.rry, and that a. singleyesr&apos;s age group should he inserted in the Pill, the precise yefir *o be chosen being settled at a meeting to be held on t be enpuin^ day.     TH&quot;? CHAHCELLOP OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested thata. provision should be include&quot;&quot;1 allowing for postpone-ment or anticipation of the date of ceiling up in special cases .     Period, of Military Training.  It was agreed thatthis period should be limited to six months.
          The Committee^ conclusions were asfellows:-     (l)   That it was undesirable&apos; to introduce the          Exceptional Powers (Defence) Bill at the          present time;     (2)   That any emergency powers for requisitioning          buildingsP  etc.,  or land, required in          connection with the partial deployment of          A0D0C-.B0  or the calling up of Reservists.          should be included in the proposed Military          Training Bill;     (3)   That two separate Bills should be introduced          dealing respecfcively with (a) Mobilisation of          Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, and (b) Military          Training, these Bills corresponding to          Parts II and I  of the draft Military Training          and Reserve Forces Bill:     (4)   That each of these Bills should contain a          clause to the  effect that the Act is to          continue In force for three years,-, provided          that -          (a)  at any time  His Majesty may by Order in               Council declare that the necessity for               this measure has ceased to exist, when               the Act would expire except as regards               things already done under it:          (b)  after the  termination of three years, the               Act may be continued from year to year               by means  of an affirmative resolution of               both Houses  of Parliament;     (5)   That the announcement to be made by the Prime          Minister -n Wednesday should refer to both          Bills;  that both Bills should if possible,          be introduced simultaneously, but that every          endeavour should be mad.e to secure the passage          into law within a few days thereafter of the          Mobilisation of the Reserve and Auxiliary          Foroes Bill;     (6)   That the Military Training Bill should contain a          provision enabling all British subjects within          a single year&apos;s age group to be called up for          training:  but  that consideration should be given          to the inclusion of a provision allowing          individuals to  apply to be called up either          earlier or later than the normal age group:     (7)   That the year&apos;s a^e group to be included in the          Bill should. be  determined at a meeting to be          held at Richmond. Terrace on Tuesday, the          25th April, at 10,45 a-,m, of the following          Ministers:-             The  Chancellor  of  the  Duchy  of  Lancaster                                      (In the  Chair),             The  Lord Privy  Seal,             The  First Lord  of  the  Admiralty,             The  Secretary of  State for War,             The  Secretary of  State for Air,             The  Minister of Labour9             together with their Advisers and  Parliamentary             Counsel,,
1 G11 u 1 (8)   That an endeavour should be made  at the      above meeting to settle any other      outstanding points on both Bills,      particularly the provisions as  to      exemptions from and for postponements of      military training, with a view  to a      report on any points of substance being      made to the Cabinet at the meeting to be      held at 6 p0m., on Tuesday, the  25th April: (9)   That the period of military training to  be      included in the Bill should be  six months:(10)   That the Lord Chancellor should be authorised      to speak in confidence to Lord  Buckmaster      (who has given notice of a Motion on      Compulsory Military Service for Debate in      the House of Lords on Wednesday,  the      26th April) with a view to inducing.him to      withdraw his Motion^Richmond^ TejcraoeW. 1.   25th April, 1939.
