Note by  the  Secretary.       The attached revised draft of the Reserve and auxiliary Forces Bill  is submitted to the Cabinet onthe  instructions of a Ministerial Committee preside over by the Lord chancellor the draft incorporatescertain amendments agreed upon at a meeting of that committee held on Friday, 28th April.   These amendments,together with certain further amendments subsequentlyincorporated in the Bill, are summarised in the attachedexplanatory Note0(Signed)  EBRIDGES,Secretary to the Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I. ,      30th April, 1939,.
ft ALit)         RESERVE AND AUXILIARY FORGES BILL.                EXPLANA TORY NOTE. Preamble and Clause 1 (l), 1.      It was suggested in discussion at  the Ministerial Committee that it was  essential to make  it clear that the Bill  does  not empower the Government to  use the  simplified procedure now proposed to call up troops for use for &quot;strike-breaking&quot;  purposes,,    The  Committee, therefore,  thought it desirable, both in  the Preamble and in Clause  X (l),  to use  the  words &quot;urgently required for  ensuring preparedness for the defence of the  realm  against  any external danger&quot;o Training of  Reservists. 2.        The question was raised whether  the Bill, as  drafted,  makes provision for calling up  men  of the  Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, not only in order  that  they may proceed to their war stations,  but  also in order that they may undergo  training.   The answer is that the Bill as  drafted does  so provide. Reinstatement.   Clause 2. 3.      It was  agreed  at the Ministerial Committee that a  clause  dealing with this matter should be included  in  the draft Bill.   A draft clause has since teen prepared,  in consultation with theMinistry  of Labour.   This  clause has not been considered by the Ministerial Committee.
i. JSim-plification of procedure for obtainingpossession of land taken under the Defence Acts.Clause 5..4.     This clause does not confer on theDefence Departments any fresh powers for obtaining possession of land, whether requiredpermanently or temporarily.   The effect of theclause is limited to certain changes in procedure,to enable the Defence Departments, in cases wherethey already have power to take land, either byagreement or by  the use of compulsory powers,to obtain speedy possession.5.     Under the Defence Acts, if a defence department wishes to acquire land compulsorily,a certificate must be obtained from the lord lieutenant of the County.   It is not proposed tomodify this.6.     When the  certificate of the Lord Lieutenanthas been, obtained, under present procedure, thematter has to go before the Justices.   this involves a delay of from two weeks to two months.The draft clause cuts out the need for submittingthe matt- r to the Justices, and enables the JJepartmerrtto take possession of the land, subject to 14days1 notice, as soon as the certificate from t&apos;heLord Lieutenant  has; been obtained,7e     The existing position as to compensation under the Defence Acts  is  not disturbed.
                                                     &amp; jl iConsequential provisions.  Clause h.8.     The Ministerial Committee were informed thatnumerous adjustments in respect of the existing lav/will he required as a result of the present proposals.In particular, amendments of existing pensions and insurance legislation will he needed.  The choice liesbetween (a) covverting the present Bill into a lengthy-measures containing clauses dealing specifically witha host of matters consequential upon the calling out for service of the Reserve and Auxiliary  Forces, and(b) including in the Bill a single omnibus clause takingpower to deal with consequential matters by Order inCouncil.9.     The Ministerial Committee were of opinion thatit is essential, in laying before Parliament an urgentmeasure of the present character, to aim at simplicityand brevity.  Accordingly, the draft now submitted tothe Cabinet deals with consequential matters generallyby means of an omnibus clause.  It was felt, however,that the requisitioning  of land was  so important amatter that it was undesirable to deal with it in theomnibus clause, and that a separate  clause should beincluded to deal with this point.  This matter is,therefore, dealt with in clause 3 of the Bill, to which reference has already been made.Expenses.  Clause 5.10.    This clause has been added since the draft was seen Dy the Ministerial Committee.  It is clear that expenditure will be iiaiorocroo-ar as a result of the orders in Council dealing with  consequential matters (e.g.pensions), and it is perhaps as well that this clauseshould be so drawn as to cover expenditure incurred forthe purposes of the Act&apos;Itself.                       -3-
Duration of the Powers to be conferred under the Bill.Clause 6.11.    This clause provides that the Bill is tocontinue in force for three years, and no longer;  itadds provisions (a) for the extension of the powers underthe Bill,  a year at a time, on Addresses being presented by both Houses of Parliament, and (b) for their earliertermination, by Order in Council.12.    Some doubt was expressed at the ministerial committee   whether the words in square brackets incluse 6(3) were necessary.  These words deal with the somewhat technical point of the position of men called up under the Act who may be serving on the expiry ofthe Act by effluxion of time.  It is understood thatthe  Defence Departments are in favour of the inclusionof these words.Richmond Terrace, S.W.  1.      30th April, 1939.
