(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S                      GOVERNMENT.)S E C R E To                                Copy No........                      CABINET.CP. 98 (39).                    CORPORAL PUNISHMENT.                Memorandum by the Home Secretary.     la  In accordance with the. decision reached by theCabinet on 22nd June, 1938, (Cabinet Conclusions 29(38)Conclusion 8) the Criminal Justice Bill contains a clauseproposing to abolish corporal punishment as a court penalty.     2.  The question of the power of the courts to sentenceoffenders to corporal punishment was debated at four sessions of the Standing Committee., and eventually the clause wascarried by 32 votes to 17.  The majority voting in favourof the clause consisted mainly of members of the opposition parties, and only three supporters of the Government, apartfrom the Ministerial representatives and the ParliamentaryPrivate Secretaries, voted in favour of the retention ofthe clause.     3.  Since the Bill was reported by the StandingCommittee, the Chief Whip has supplied to me confidentiallya list of some 203 members of the Conservative Party who,during the Report Stage, intend to support an amendment todelete the clause and I understand that there is aconsiderable number of other members who desire to retaincorporal punishment.     4.  In these circumstances I should be glad to receive
 the  advice  of my  colleagues as  to  the  line v/hich I  should pursue  when this  clause  comes up for discussion on  the floor  of  the House.    I  assume that  there is no question of leaving the matter  to  a  free votes  since such a course would he  likely only to  cause confusion and might encourage the  House of Lords  to  throw out the Clause, especially if it were passed by the  House of  Commons by only a small minority  consisting mostly of members  of the Opposition., Nor  do  I  think it is practicable to devise any compromise.. As the  Departmental Committee on Corporal Punishment pointed out,  the  existing law  is full of anomalies and anachronisms which even  the supporters of corporal punishment find themselves  unable to defendo  On the other hand, neither the  Committee nor my advisers are  able to suggest any principle on which  a list could be prepared of offences in respect  of which the power to award corporal punishment should be retainedo  The main case for abolition is that corporal  punishment is unnecessary as a deterrent and the weight  of evidence  shows that it is not essential for theprotection  of the community to  retain, in respect of anyoffence, whatever additional element of deterrence  may beprovided by the power  to impose a  sentence of corporal punishment  in addition to a long sentence of imprisonmentor penal servitude.      5.   Z  think, therefore, that  the Government cannot make  any concession in the direction of rationalising theexisting law, and that we must  maintain the principle thatcorporal punishment should be abolished in respect  of alloffences.    The only proposal which 2 can make to meet the
critics of the Governments proposal is that the abolitionof corporal punishment should in the first instance he foran experimental period of, say, five years  At the end ofthat time it would he for Parliament to decide, in thelight of the experience gained and of the public feelingthen prevailing, whether or not the abolition of corporal punishment should be made permanent,,  I have accordinglyhad prepared an amendment the effect of which is to suspend,for a period of five years, the existing power of thecourts to pass sentences of corporal punishment,,  A copyof the amendment is attached,, -     60  If the Cabinet agree that the Government mustbe prepared to make some concession on the lines of theamendment, the question arises whether I should announce the Governments decision by putting an amendment on theOrder Paper or whether it would be better to await thecourse of the discussion during the Report Stage.  Inmy view the best course is to arrange for a private member to put down an amendment to the clause which couldbe accepted by me, if the debate showed that the House was in favour of the proposal that corporal punishment shouldbe suspended for a period  I should be glad to know whethermy colleagues agree with this suggestion..                                          S oH o27th April, 1939.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL      To  give  effect  to  the  suggested alteration of the  corporal  punishment provisions of  this BillP three amendments  would  be required to  clause 340 The effect of  these amendments  would be to make the clause read as  follows:-      &quot;Suspension  of           340 Notwithstanding       power to pass       sentence of          anything in any enactment,       corporal       punishmento           no person shall, during the                            period of five years                            beginning with the                            commencement of this Act,                           be sentenced by a court to                            corporal punishmento&quot;      It  would also be necessary to remove from the minor  Amendments  and Repeals Schedules the enactments relating to corporal punishment which  are at presentincluded in those Schedules in consequence of clause 340      It  would also be necessary to amend the new clause (now clause 36) which was introduced in committee with a view to enabling clause 34 to be applied to naval  courts--martial by Order in Council 0   The navy hasalready  had an experimental period of  some sixty years in which corporal punishment has not been inflicted,and  it is understood that the Admiralty do not desire that, if tho abolition is to  be for an  experimental period, any provi ^oi- should be made  in respect of navalcourts-martialo
