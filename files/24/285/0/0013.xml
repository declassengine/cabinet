PROPOSALS FOR COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING.                  Ii  INTRODUCTORY.     1.   In recent weeks there has been continuousand increasing pressure from public opinion in thiscountry as well as in France for the adoption bythis country of a scheme of compulsory militarytraining, as an earnest of our determination to spareno effort to resist aggression.   Our own problems in regard to the Air Defence of Great Britain havealso drawn attention to the difficulty of securing a state of constant readiness to meet air attack,thoughout a prolonged period of tension, without somerecourse to the principle of compulsory militarytraining.   On the other hand, it has been evidentthat the labour movement would offer strong oppositionto any proposal to introduce conscription as apermanent feature of our system.     2.   The plan described in the ensuing paragraphsis designed to make it possible to introduce alimited measure of compulsory military training in a form that will meet our own practical requirements and which, while it may not secure the active supportof the labour movement, may at least avoid arousingtheir strong opposition.   This is of importance, sincethe introduction of this measure will only constitute an effective demonstration of the spirit of thecountry, if it is presented in a form which secures
a wide measure of approval.,     3.   The plan outlined in this Memorandum doesnot, therefore, introduce conscription as a permanentmeasure, nor make  it the general  basis  for the  recruitment of aur national f oro.es,,    Thus;     (i)  The plan will not supersede our existing          traditional methods of voluntary service.          The voluntary principle will continue in          force for recruiting for the Navy? the          Royal Air Force, the Regular Army, the          Territorial Army, and other auxiliary          forces, the various Civil Defence forces,          and other forms of National Service^,          The plan aims at providing a special          supplementation of these methods, more          particularly for the Air Defence of Great          Britain, confined to Home Defence unless          and until War breaks out;    (ii)  Apart from  the need to devise a plan for          compulsory military training that will not          lead  to a violent cleavage between labour          and the State, there are distinct          advantages  in  taking steps now to place          ourselves more nearly in the position of          other European countries  in respect of          preparedness for war.   Under our present          system  we  cannot make  adequate  arrangements          to meet conditions of prolonged  periods of          international  tension.;  nor can we take steps          that  may be necessary to meet changing
          conditions without all the publicity and          disturbance of -public opinion attendant upon          Royal Proclamationso    It is proposed,          therefore, (while making it abundantly  clear          that we do not regard war as imminent,  and that          we are only taking precautionary measures) to          pass legislation, which will enable us  to  carry          out, at will and as circumstances dictate, the          various measures which may be necessary in order          to secure an adequate state of preparedness.               The plan for compulsory military training now          proposed will be linked legislatively with the          other exceptional powers which it is proposed to          obtain from parliament, and will be limited in          duration to the period during which these          exceptional powers continue in force.     4.   It is a commonplace that whenever a measureof compulsory military service  is suggested, the  claim is made that there should be no conscription of labour orman-power without a conscription of wealth.   this argument can be met in part by drawing attention  to  thefact that there is already a considerable measure of conscription of wealth.   Income Tax&quot;, Surtax and  DeathDuties are all at high levels  and have all been increased in recent years.   Further, it is intended,as part of the emergency powers to be obtained in theimmediate future, to take steps to control the profits of firms mainly engaged on the re-armament programme.   Itmay also be possible to make some statement about thetreatment of wealth at the end of a war, should war  takeplace.                          - 3 -
IIo  DEFENCE PREPAREDNESS,1 ^ &quot;1      5.   Broadly,  the present position is that, except for a few  small and relatively not very important classes, it is impossible  to mobilise any  of our reserve or auxiliary forces without  declaring  a State of Emergencyo   Continental countries,  on the  other hand, are in a position to carry out partial  or  selective measures of mobilisation by calling up. for  example, the 1920 class or the  technicians belonging to some  other class.   In recent weeks considerable measures of mobilisation have been taken by most continental countries, and  this country,  alone of  the Powers likely to be involved in hostilities at  the outset, has taken no corresponding preparatory steps.      6.   There is a natural reluctance to declare a State of Emergency in this country, since this step is usually only taken when  a war appears to be imminent as the result of tension  over some  particular episode, and then only at the very last moment,  for fear  lest such a declaration would wreck the  chances of a settlement0      7.   To meet  this difficulty it is proposed that a statement should be  made to Parliament, explaining frankly the difficulties in which we are placed, owing to the fact that our machinery for mobilisation  does not meet the needs of the present  situation,  in which we live for months at a time in something which is neither  peace nor war.   It should be announced that His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided to introduce legislation to provide that the King may by Order in Council  empower the Admiralty and the Secretaries of State for War  and  Air to call  out the whole or any part of the members of the  reserve or auxiliary forces, and to vary or revoke the directions  so given, without the necessity for a Royal Pro- clamation.   It is not intended to carry cut general mobilisation, hut  to take such partial measures as may be necessary from time to time  to  increase  the degree of our preparedness.  Thesemeaaur-es could later be increased or decreased  in the  light of circumstances without any further powers from Parliament.                                A
i9 9   80   The effect upon the City and upon foreign holders of sterling has to he borne in mind, and great care will benecessary in framing the statement in Parliament,,            III.  EXCEPTIONAL POWERS (DEFENCE) BILL.   9,   At one time it was suggested that the Emergency Powers(Defence) Bill (commonly called D.O.R.A.) should be passed into law  in peace, on the understanding that the powers conferredwould only be exercised in time of war.   This suggestion was rejected on the ground that, if an attempt were made to pass theBill in time of peace, there might be prolonged  discussion whichmight result in a whittling down of powers which would be essential in time of war.   Accordingly,  it was  decided to defer the  introduction of the Bill until immediately after the outbreakof war, when it should be passed into law as  quickly as possible.  10.   If the suggestion is adopted that legislation  should nowbe passed enabling the reserve and auxiliary  forces  to be called out  without the declaration of a state  of emergency, the positionin regard to the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill must bere considered.   In view of (i) the steps  taken by Germany andItaly, (ii) our new commitments to Poland, etc,  and  (iii) the apparent increase in general tension, Parliament should be askedto pass the Bill into law forthwith, on the understanding that theGovernment would only exercise such of  the powers conferred as were necessary to meet the situation immediately confronting us,or any changed situation which we were  called upon to face fromtime to time.   For example, as part of the scheme referred to inparagraphs 14 and 15, the War Office would require the powers ofrequisitioning land and buildings which are included in the draftEmergency Powers (Defence) Bill, and Regulations to be madeunder the Act.  11.   In view of the need for avoiding public  alarm,  it isthought that if the Bill is to be introduced forthwith it had better be described as The Exceptional Powers (Defence) Bill,instead of The Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill.                          -5-                           ^  ....
                                                       la J            IV.  COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING.    IS.   Powers would be taken in a I ilitaryTraining Bill  to call up for military training all the menborn in a particular year; e.g., 1919, or those aged 20years on a particular date.  The calling up could be doneby means of the machinery devised for the Ministry ofNational Service which would operate in time of war, andwhich would be set in operation for this purpose.    13.   The number of males in each year&apos;s age group isbelieved to be about 300,000.  The War Office would wish tohave about 200,000 or 250,000 men each year for compulsory military training, and this might well be the numberavailable, after the rejection of the medically unfit.Details of the plan, as suggested by the War Office, aregiven in the Appendix.    14.   As is explained in the Appendix, the War Officepropose that 80,000 of the men enlisted under the scheme should be called up in batches and trained for service inthe Air Defence of Great Britain.  When the scheme is inoperation, it will enable a permanent nucleus of our air defences to be manned continuously.    15.   It is anticipated, however, that it will take some weeks before the new scheme of compulsory militarytraining could be set in operation.   To meet the gap, theW?r Office propose the following: measures:-           (a)  To meet thd immediate situation, various                Territorial units of the Air Defence of                Great Britain should be called out as                soon as legislation has been passed                enabling the Reserve and Auxiliary                Forces to be called out without a Royal                Proclamation.   To man the permanent                nucleus of the Air Defence of Great                Britain, it would be necessary to call                cut about one-third of the A.D.G.B.                units.   Each of the units called out                would serve for, say, one month, and                would then be relieved by another unit               . called up  ?oi  the purpose.
      (b) At the end of the period of three months the         manning of the permanent nucleus of the Air         Defence of Great Britain would be taken over by         Regular Reservists, who would be called up as         BOOK as the legislation referred to  in (a)         had  been passed, and would then be given special         training in the operation of searchlights and         anti-aircraft guns.   These units would be         relieved as soon as the first batch of men called         up under the new scheme for compulsory training        . had  completed three months training.   160   It would be necessary to make provision toensure that the scheme of compulsory military  training nowproposed would not operate to the detriment of recruitment for the auxiliary services of the Navy and Royal Air Force.It is thought that this could not be done by grantingexemption from compulsory military training to any personswho expressed a preference for service in the  atixiliaryservices of the Navy and Royal Air Force, since this would afford a way  in which persons could avoid six months&apos;continuous training by opting for some auxiliary service with less onerous conditions.   This point is not, perhaps,very serious  if the scheme is regarded as a measure adopted for a limited period, but it requires further  considerationby the Defence Departments, in consultation.   The option tojoin these services, in so far as vacancies exist, could begiven to them, after their period of compulsory training.as an alternative to joining the territorial army.            V.   CONSCRIPTION OF WEALTH.   17.   It must be assumed that the introduction of any form of conscription,  however limited in duration or in scope and character, would bring to the forefront the questionof what is called consciption of wealth.  It is not likely that the former could be encompassed without some action being taken or commitments entered into with regard to the latter.   18.   As regards present action, the high rates of direct taxation are in themselves,  of course,  aconscription of wealth.    The rates of surtax and estate                    -7-
duty which would be especially looked at are, however,  so   J                                                            ghigh that they do not lend themselves to any very greataddition except in time of war.  The point upon which public attention has recently been chiefly concentratedis  the amount of profit made by firms engaged in themanufacture of munitions.  Although these criticismshave at present no very solid base, except in the caseof  the aircraft industry, where the problem is being met by  amendment of the Government contract, high profits seemnow likely to begin to emerge over a wide area, if onlyon  account of the vast volume of work being carried out.    19.   The introduction of some measure of limitationof profits of munitions firms concurrently with theintroduction of any measure of conscription may be judgednecessary.  The problem of its form is difficult andwould require careful investigation.   Perhaps some special ma cn. in cry could he devised for the ad hocexamination of the profits of each munitions firm designedto  secure that in any case in which profits wereunreasonably increased the firm could be required to hand over the excess to the Exchequer.    20.   It would be for consideration also whether someannouncement should not be made of the Government&apos;intention that war, if it comes, should not be allowedto  lead to the enrichment of individuals in the way thathappened in the Great War.  It would be possible to announce in  general terms the intention of the Government, if warcomes, to increase substantially the present high ratesof  direct taxation.  It would be possible to lay downtoo that the war  will not &quot;be allowed to be used as an occasion for unreasonable accretions to the income or the wealth of individuals, that profiteering which can be identified as such will be subject to special penalties,
and that exceptional accretions of income or wealth willhe appropriately curtailed.   This would in effect commit the Government in or after war to two courses, both ofwhich give rise to many difficulties, but neither of whichwould be impracticable.  These courses would be first theimposition in war-time of some type of excess profits duty,and secondly the imposition after the war of some typeof levy on war-time increases in the. wealth of individualssimilar to that which was examined by a Select Committeeof the House of Commons at the end of the last war but notat that time proceeded with.22nd April, 1939.
                 APPENDIX.      THE WAR OFFICE SCHEME FOR COMPULSORY             MILITARY TRAINING-oExej^tlc^^jFrom Compulsory Military Training.     lo   All persons who (a) have already been accepted for the recognised term of service in any of the Regular Armed Forces of the Crown-,  or  (b)  who  at  the  d-te  of the  announcement  of thescheme have already been accepted for  the recognised term of service, in  one  of  the Auxiliary  forces,  would be  exempted.     20    It would probably be necessary  to provide for persons with conscientious objection to military servicec     3o   There would-also probably be  claims.- for exemption on compassionate grounds, or for those who were regarded as &quot;key&quot; men in industry.   It is thought,however, that very few men of 20 could properly be regardedas key men-,    As one of the strongest appeals of the plan will be its universal application, it will probably bethought right strictly to limit exemptions.Period of Service.     40   Persons enlisted under this&apos;scheme should becalled up (probably in quarterly batches) for six monthscontinuous military training.   On completion of thisperiod they would serve for 3^ years (making 4 years inall) in Territorial Army units.   During  this latter periodthey would have the same obligations as those of existingTerritorials, i0e., about 30 drills a year and a fortnightin camp.     50   Apart from the need to confine  the scheme to home Defence, so as to minimise Labour  Opposition? aperiod of six months&apos; compulsory military.training
1^9 obviously  does not permit of a man  being  first trained and  then sent overseas for any appreciable period. It would therefore be an essential  feature of the scheme  that men enlisted under it would not be liable for  service overseas unless and until war broke out. Conditions of Service.     6.   It is suggested that pay might  be at the rate of 6d. a  day.   It might  be necessary  to make  some provision for the maintenance of wives and children. Training..for the Air Defence of Great Britain.     7.   It is proposed that approximately 80,000 of those enlisted under this scheme should be trained for service in the Air Defence of Great Britain.   These men would be called up in quarterly batches of 20,000 each..   They could be trained in approximately three months.   When the scheme is in full operation there would thus always be 40,000 men serving in the Air Defence of Great Britain, of whom. 20,000 would be fully trained.   This would enable a permanent nucleus of theAir Defence of Great Britain to be manned continuously. Training with Field Army Units.     8.   The remaining men enlisted under the scheme for Compulsory Military Training would be allotted to special training units ,  49- attached to units  of the Regular Army.Accommodation, etc.     9.   It will be necessary to set up rapidly a large number of training centres.    This will involve a large programme of hutted accommodation, and some special
delegation of authority will be required to enable this programme to be carried through in the short time available.Galling up of Reserves.    10.   It is understood that if the scheme outlined in this Paper is adopted, the War Office propose, as soon  as- the necessary  legislation has been passed,  tocall up a number of Reservists for the following purposes;-     (i)  to fill up certain Regular units which are          short of establishment:    (ii)  to undergo training in the use of searchlights          and anti-aircraft guns, so as to be able to          take over the manning of the Air Defence of          Great Britain from the Territorial Army after          three months (see paragraph 15 of the          Memorandum)   (iii)  To act as W.C.O. Instructors for the new units          of the Territorial Army shortly to be formed,          and for  the men who would be enlisted under          the new  scheme of compulsory military training.Appeal for Recruits for Regular and Territorial Armies.    11.   The War Office would propose to continue the appeal for voluntary recruits for the Territorial Armyunder the scheme recently announced for bringing theTerritorial Field Army up to war establishment  and doublingit.    The far Office would also undertake a big oa. p-aignfor recruits for the Regular Ar y.    The figuresof the requirements under this head  naveno**,  it is understood,  been agreed between
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary oState for War,   In all 80,000 are required in thecurrent financial year.   This total is made up asfollows: -               normal wastage     20,000               existing shortage - 20,000               new requirements - 30,000.&apos;
