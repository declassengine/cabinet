              MILITARY TRAINING 13ILL.                EXPLANATORY NOTE.          The object of this Note is to explain themain provisions of the Bill as briefly as possible,without attempting to use language which is alwaystechnically accurate.I. THE MAIN PROVISIONS OP THE BILL.1.        The foundation of the Bill is the obligationimposed on all male British subjects to he registeredf or military training while between  the ages of 20 and21 (Clause l(l).)..  A man is liable to he called up forhis military training within a year  of registration(Clause 1(2)),2.        The exempt i on s from reg-istration and calling up for military training are set out in Clause 2,  Themain principles underlying these- exemptions are (a)persons normally resident in, or in  the service of, theDominions, etc., (b) members of the  regular defence forces, (o) members of the Auxiliary Forces who areliable to conditions of service at least as strenuousas those to he imposed on persons called up under  the Act.II.  MECHANISM AND STAGES OF CALLING UP.3.        The first stage is registration (Clause  l(1))./Note that a man who fails to register can he fined  5,and that when he has been found and  registered, heremains liable to be called up for military service for a period of a year after registration, irrespective of his age when registered (Clause 1(4))J
                                                     2 (J j4.        Conscientious objectors when called up for registration, have an opportunity to apply for registration as conscientious objectors, instead offor military training.  Such persons appear before a tribunal which decides whether the applicant&apos;s nameshould, be included in the register of conscientious objectors, or should be transferred to the militarytraining register,,5.        A man&apos;s name may be placed on the register of conscientious objectors, either -      (a) Unconditionally, in which case  he is            altogether exempt; or   (b) Conditionally, on his performing work of            national importance.6.        A man&apos;s name may be transferred to themilitary training register, either -      (a) Unconditionally, in which case he is            subject to military training in            the full sense; or   (b) Conditionally, which means that the man            is enlisted, but arrangements are made for him            to be employed on non-combatant duties.7.        Medical Examination.  Eor persons other thanconscientious objectors, the next stage after registrationis Medical Examination (Clause 4)0  This needs noexplanation.8.        Calling up.  After Medical Examination, theMinister has power to issue notices calling up men formilitary training at any time within  a  year afterthe date of registration  (Clauses 5 and 1(2)).
III -   WHAT PROVISIONS ARE THERE TO ENABLE THE MINISTER TO      DEAL WITH&quot;HARD GASES OR WITH MEN WHO ARE URGENTLY      REQUIRED FOR RE-ARMAMENT WORK?9.     The only explicit provision in the Act dealing withthis point is clause 1(3 )* which enables the Minister,on due cause being shown, to permit a man, (a) to registerand to be called up for  service before he attains the ageof 20;  (b) to postpone  his liability to be called up fortraining.  (Where such applications are made on grounds of hardship, applications  unless grantee by the Minister, are referred to a Military Training Committee).10.    It will be noted  however that clause 5* by implication, leaves it to the Minister to determine uponwhat persons he should cause calling up notices to be served.  It would therefore be open to him not to servecalling up notices in certain cases.  But if he omits toissue a calling up notice until after the expiration ofa year from the date of  registration, the man is free ofhis obligations under the Act.IV.  APPLICATION TO NORTHERN IRELAND,11.    Clause 15 provides that the Bill should be extendedto Northern Ireland subject to such moaifications andadaptations as may be specified in the order.   Provision onthese lines is necessary for administrative purposes, since it will be necessary to maize various adaptations of themachinery of the scheme  and its application to NorthernIreland.12.    It will also be noted that there is a provision in clause 2 which exempts from liability any person who&quot;is a member of any naval, military or air force raised bythe Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominionsoutside the United Kingdom&quot;.  It follows that  if
2(j *Mr. de Valera is willing to set up any suitable force in eire, and to accept as members of the force Irishnationalists, whether normally resident in NorthernIreland or in Great Britain, such persons by joining the force- to be set up in Eire will in future be able to exempt themselves from liability under the Bill.13.    The position of Irish nationalists resident inNorthern Ireland or Great Britain who would becomeimmediately liable, on the passing of the Bill, while there is no    Eire Force which they could  join,could be met in a variety of ways without any specific provision, in the Bill.  Thus it could be. announced:-      into operation for some time;   or(b) That the Order in Council extending the      Bill to Northern Ireland could Contain      provision for postponing its operation for      some time;  or(c) That the machinery enabling individuals to      obtain postponement of an application      (clause 1(3)) could be used to give a      postponement to persons who intend, within      a reasonable time to join the  Dominion      Force.sufficient to make an announcement on the above lines,and that a second proviso should be inserted to clause 1(1) as follows :-(a)That the Order in Council extending theBill to Northern Ireland would not comeIh.It may,  however, be argued that it is not-k-
9^0W fj 0       &quot;Z (b) any person required in accordance with the              provisions of this Act to make within (one)              month after the passing of this Act application              to be registered may, if he intends to become              a member of any naval, military or air force              raised by the Government of a part of His              Majesty&apos;s dominions outside the United              Kingdom notify the Minister of that intention              in the prescribed manner and upon receiving              notification the Minister shall unless he has              reason to believe that the notification was              not given in good faith, permit him to defer              his application until the end of that month,              but if at the expiration of that month he has              not become a member of such a force as              aforesaid he shall continue to be liable to              be registered notwithstanding that he has              attained the age of twenty-one yearsr27&quot;15*    This proviso would however have the serious dis-advantage that it would provide a loophole whereby other types of recalcitrant persons, and not merely IrishNationalists, could postpone for a time their liability under the Bill.V.   COMPOSITION OF TRIBUNALS..      (Part II of Schedule)016.    The draft includes  in  square brackets provisionfor - ^certain members of these Tribunals being appointedafter consultation with representatives of workers.   this phrase is generally understood to moan the General Councilof the Trades Union Gongress0   It is in favour of thisprovision that it follows the practice of the last war,which, in general, it would be desired to follow.17.    The difficulty about inserting these words in theBill at the present time is that it is understood that thegeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress have arrangeda meeting in the course of the next few ciays to determinetheir attitude to the Bill.   If the words in square brackets
                                                       2 (J 9are included in the Bill, it may he argued that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are &quot;trying to forestall this decision..On the other hand, if the words are omitted, it may heargued that His Majesty&apos;s Government are putting the TradesUnion Congress in a worse position in this matter than theyoccupied in the last  war.       In either event  the Trades Union Congress may argue that His Majesty&apos;s Government have failed to consult them as to the machinery of  the Bill.18.    The arguments for and against including the words in square brackets in the  Bill would appear to be nicelybalanced..VI.   NOTES ON CLAUSES.19.-   The above notes cover the main provisions in Glauses1 to 5 (1).       Clause 5(2) and (3) puts every man called up forMilitary Training into  the militia, on conditions which involve six months continuous training, followed by 3-gyears under the normal  arrangements (understood to be threeweeks training a year,  plus a certain number of drills)unless -       (a) He goes into the Regular Forces, or       (b) After completion of six months continuous             training,  he joins the auxiliary forces.20.    Reinstatement in Civil Employment (Clause ,6 .),.       This clause follows clause 2 of the Reserve and auxiliary Forces Bill.21.    Simplification of procedure for obtaining -possession       of land.    (Clause .7. ).       This Clause follows clause 3 of the Reserve and auxiliary Forces Bill (See note in CP. 101  (39) ).

(Clause-.8.);The object of this Clause is to give the Admiralty  power toset up a Reserve Force which will have conditions ofservice and obligations which will be appropriate to themen called up under the Military Training Bill, andassigned  to the Navy.   The conditions of service  of theexisting naval Auxiliary Forces are not altogetherappropriate for this purpose.23.    Information to be furnished by local Education       Authorities.   (&quot;Clause  9 T&quot;.  &quot;       The point of this Clause is that information obtained from schools and colleges would give far more recent information as t o persons in the 20-21 year  age groupthan could be obtained from the registrars of births.24.    Consequential matters. (Clause .10 ).   This  followsclause 4 of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill.25.    Clauses 11 and 12.   No comments called for.26.    Expenses ( Clause &apos;15 ).
