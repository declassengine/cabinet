It is requested that special care may be taken to                      ensure the secrecy of this document.                                 CABINET.GROWTH  OF  CIVIL  EXPENDITURE.;;&apos;                  Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     CLAIMS which have recently been put forward for expenditure of more ofthe taxpayers money on the amendment or expansion of the system of old age pensions has led me to make an  examination of the course of public expenditureIn recent times, and I think it well  to put before my colleagues, some  facts which this  examination  reveals, and to add one or  two reflections!     2.  I append two tables, the first setting out actual  amounts of expenditure from the Budget under various  heads in a  number of years starting from  1925.the second  comparing the later  years, with 1925.  The Budgets for the  years immediately following the end of the war were a good deal  distorted by receipts and  expenditures in the nature of war remanets,  and the  year 1925  makes  thefliost convenient starting point.                                   .  .-,.;.Vi:                                   TABLE I.

Total expenditure in 1925  was some   774 million.  Total expenditurein 1939 will be some  917 million out of Revenue and probably some  1,300 millionout of Revenue and borrowing combined.  While the tables bring out the great increase  ( 110 million in 1939) in the expenditure out. of revenue (apart fromloans) for purposes of defence, the astonishing figures are those of the growth of social services and other civil expenditure :                                                                million.    . :         Social Services; growth since 1925          ...           121-3         Other Civil Expenditure; growth since 1925      ...      64-8                 Total, growth since,1925......    ...     186-1.4.  In the same,period, notwithstanding the derating of productive industry which took place  as; from October 1929 and notwithstanding increased Exchequerassistance, the sum  collected in local rates has increased since 1925 from 168  million to an amount estimated at about  210 million, an increase of 25 percent.    5.  The  question suggests itself whether  in  the  new conditions  created bythe international situation the country can afford to maintain social services  andother  civil expenditure at  417 - 4 milliom (let alone any higher figure), raised asit has been by  186 -1 million or some 80 per cent, from  231 - 3 million in littlemore  than a  decade.    6.  It is, of course, true that in  the interval since  1925 the growth of popula-tidn and of industrial and scientific efficiency has added very materially to thecountry&apos;s intrinsic wealth  and productive powers. On the other hand, however,prices have fallen and the value of  money has increased.  Some pointers to theessential facts may be found in the following figures.   The adult working popula-tion (ages 16 to 65) has increased by 10-4 per cent.; business output has increasedby 22-6 per cent.; wholesale prices have dropped by 23-8 per cent.; retail prices by 11 - 5 per cent.                                ...    7.  In the result it is generally held, though upon uncertain  data, that thenational income has risen.  The published calculations by economists and financialwriters are open to so many objections that it is undesirable to hazard a guess atthe amount of the increase,  particularly as it is known1 that fresh research is proceeding on the subject.  The figure might  be 10  per cent., but that must betreated as mere surmise.  Business profits on the average of 1937 and 1938 are nohigher than  in 1925.* And the taxable capacity of the country which dependsnot merely upon national  income, but upon such questions as the nature of itsdistribution  and  the  manner in which it is spent, has increased very little.  As    *  In 1937,  the best year in the period,  the increase over 1925 was roughly 3 per cent;                           -  TABLE II.            :&quot;&apos;Table showing Increases or Decreases in various Heads of Budget Expenditure          \         as compared with the yea?- 1925.

This gross burden has been met broadly as follows :  .   ;                                                               million.       1         By  increased ^productivity of old-established  taxes    and the Post Office      ...     ...     ...     ...      17By saving on war pensions   ...     ...     :..           &apos; 27-8By reduction in interest  on debtt.   ...     ...            .87-5By reduction of Sinking Fund      ..........      36-8By new taxes and increased rates of taxation     ...     245Total  ...     ...    ...     ...    ...     ...    414  1$ The two largest items in this list apart from new taxation are connected with the debt.   But though for the moment great help has been received from these sources, examination  shows that this help is only temporary.  Some of the reduction  in debt interest arises merely from the exceptionally low cost of  Treasury Bills andi is in the nature of things transitory; the rest of that reduction will  in future years be cancelled out, and very  likely more than  cancelled  out, by the cost  of service of new debt now being created for purposes of defence.  The  reduction of the Sinking Fund helps greatly while it lasts, but nobody would contend that it can rightly Continue indefinitely.  Prior  to 1931 it was  a cardinal objective  to increase the Sinking Fund by stages from  m. 50 to  m. 100 or more.   It is only the great but temporary relief gained in connection with the debt that has made it possible to limit new  taxation since  1925 even to  the figure of  m. 245 which itself is formidable enough when it is recalled that the year 1925 was at the time regarded as a year of very high taxation.     10.  At the present  time,  when the Budget is for  the  moment entirely unbalanced and  most  taxes  other than the income tax are generally  at  or approaching their maximum  rates,  it is pertinent  also to observe that a rise  of  186 million in social services and other  civil expenditure, such as has occurred in a period of 15 years, requires, when it cannot otherwise be met, an addition to the rate of Income Tax of roughly 3s. in the  .     *  In this and the following paragraphs  1938 has been taken in preference to 1939 to afford a fairer comparison.     t  In 1939 this figure grows to  64-8 million see  Table II.     j  Of the figure of  87-5 million,  28-3 million  is due  to non-payment of interest  on  the American Debt.     g The  small discrepancy between the totals in paragraphs 8 and 9 is due to roundings and an element of approximation in some of the figures.between  1925 and 1938,* the yield of the old-established duties of Customs and excise and  Motor Vehicle Duties (if alterations of  rates  and  structure areeliminated) has  not  varied to any significant extent,  though  on balance themovement  has been  upwards by perhaps  10 million net.   A corresponding-examination of direct taxation shows almost identical yields in 1925 and, 1938. ,.;v    8.   As between 1925 and 1938 the following main increases of expenditure and losses of revenue have had to be met:                                                              / million.
    11.  It is  well to remember also that  the  total population is  now  nearlystationary and is about to decline and that it is growing older.  As an instance ofthe effect of this it may be mentioned that, while war pensions may decline by afurther  10 million in 10 years&apos; time and  20 million in 20 years&apos;  time,  the automatic&quot;! growth of the charge  to the Exchequer of other pensions (old age and windows) will grow in 10 years by  15 million and in 20 years by  24 million.    12.  My general conclusion  is that this  is no time  for adding to the burdensof the taxpayer  any new charge for  Civil purposes which is not absolutely essential.   I have shown above  153-5 million as the extra amount,  above  theprovision required in 1925, provided for defence in 1938.  The total  expenditureon defence in 1938 from taxes was, in fact  275 - 0 million.  In the coming year weshall not be able to provide so much from taxes.   But what  will be the  futureannual charge for defence when  borrowing comes to ah end ?  No one, least of allin view of  the  increases just publicly announced, including the doubling  of  theTerritorial army, would put the  permanent annual charge below  300 million; itmay be  400 million.  If we are  engaged in war  there will be enormous additions to the  Budget in respect of new  debt.  If  there is no war great future additions to taxation will be needed.   Even if we had in prospect great additions  to  ourrevenue (and we have  none at  all)  yet they are all bespoken.   It is an utterlyremote prospect that our expenditure on Defence should sink again to the levelof  100 million or  120 million of a few years back.  Until that actually happensthere will be great difficulty in maintaining civil expenditure at its present height!Indeed, sooner  or later the question is bound to arise of a general cut, such asthat experienced in 1931. In the meanwhile the gravity of the issues now beforethe country is itself a, sufficient answer to claimants for new expenditure for socialends.
