(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.CP. 84&apos;(REVISE59).COPY NO.C A BINE T.MINISTRY OP SUPPLY.(Previous Papers CP. 240(58), 23(59), 55(59), 48(59) ).Memorandum &quot;by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence     and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.held on 2nd february, 1939, we submitted to our colleagues a memorandum, CP. 48 (39) on the subjectof supply organization in peace and war,   We have reviewed this matter in the light of recent events and decisions.   In the memorandum to which we have referred, we set out the advantages and disadvantages of a Ministry of Supply in time of peace.   The,-maindisadvantage to which we drew attention was the&apos; breakin the important chain of responsibility from the user,through the designer to the producer - a disadvantagewhich may affect one Service more than another.   Butin addition we drew attention to the danger ofinterrupting the supply of material &quot;by altering our arrangements for supply, at this stage in the rearmament programme.    We also commented on the present positionof affairs with regard to supply matters, and invitedI.EFFECT OP RECENT DECISIONS.1.In accordance with Conclusion 7 of the Cabinet
our colleagues to agree with us in expressing reluctance to change this supply organization in the peacetimeconditions which we then described.2.     But in paragraph 2 of our memorandum, we pointedout: -          &quot;A further advantage of a Ministry of            Supply is that, if a situation should            arise in which it is necessary to            create as rapidly as it can he done            a large increase in productive capacity            by reason, for instance, of a decision            to make a big expansion of the land            forces, the type of organization and            personnel required is rather that            characteristic of the Ministry of            Munitions than that normally available            in Government Departments&quot;.3.     The Admiralty and Air Ministry are, at the presen-time , carrying out successfully supply arrangementsbased on programmes of relatively long standing, andwe are reluctant to interfere with them.   The War-Office has successfully competed with, and is indeedahead of schedule on their authorized programme as it-existed up to a month ago.   Recent decisions, however,profoundly affect the Army hypothesis which we thenconsidered, and compel us to invite our colleagues toconsider further the decision so recently reached.Increases in the Regular Army have been authorised,and further important increases are under consideration.Over and above this, the decision was recently announcedthat the existing 13 divisions of the Territorial army should (a) be brought up to war establishment, and (b)when so brought up, be doubled in numbers.4.     The Secretary of State for War is thus suddenlyfaced with problems of the greatest complexity affectingevery activity of the Army.   On the one hand, there are55 Cabinet 15 (39.)
                                                      othe questions affecting the recruitment and training ofthe personnel;  on the other hand, the supply of a great variety   of articles of equipment, many of which must be manufactured on a mass production &quot;basis, in viewof the high rate of expenditure in war.   The Secretaryof State for War is himself strongly of the opinionthat the performance of this task will necessitate theWar Office undertaking functions which are outside thescope of a normal Defence Department, and  that it is imperative to detach supply responsibility from theWar Office and to place it in the hands of a separateMinister and Ministry.  We have -come to the conclusionthat we must accept the view of the Secretary of state in this matter.   But in doing so, we wish to state thatthe work done on the lesser task previously set to theWar Offica..has. &quot;been-carried through in a way whichreflects very great credit on its supply and production department.   Further, it is obvious that the--es-establishment of a separate Ministry of Supply for  the Army now would have the advantage of^giving experience in the organisation--and -w-opking- of such a department and wouldsmooth the transition to a Ministry of-Supply in a fuller sense, if found necessary in time of war.Recommendation.5.     We, therefore, recommend to our colleagues thatthey should authorise the establishment of a Ministrywhich, should take over the duties of Army  supply, aswell as those agency services which are at presentdischarged by the War Office for other Departments(see paragraph 16).
$  In this report we deal only with Field Army   Divisions, and we exclude the seven Territorial   A.A. Divisions which form part of A.D.G-.B.   Provision of the equipment, reserves and war   potential for these divisions has we understand   been authorised,/  This Armoured Division has since been expanded   to two divisions.55  Cabinet 8 (39) Conclusion 6. ,.     EXTENT OF TIilrj ARAIY SUPPLY  .              PROBLEM.Need for decision as to &quot;basis of supply arrangements forTerritorial Army.6.     Before dealing with the duties which it is proposedto entrust to such a Ministry, it is necessary by way of introduction to consider the nature and extent of the taskwith which the Ministry would be faced.       Until recently the are programme  has been basedupon the provision, but not on a Continental scale,of war equipment, war reserves and war potential for theRegular Contingent of the Field Force, comprising 4Infantry and 1 Armoured Division.   The programme includedprovision of a minimum scale of training equipment, for the13 Territorial Divisions;  but no provision for reserves orwar potential for any of these Territorial Divisions^7.     Recently authority has been given by the Cabinetto incur expenditure on war reserves and potential on thebasis that a contingent of 4- Territorial Divisions should proceed overseas 6 months o.fter the outbreak of war*8.     It is now necessrry to consider on what basissupply arrangements should be made for the TerritorialArmy, consequent upon the decision to raise 13 newdivisions, making 26 in all.   We have considered various ,plans.   One plan would be to aim at providing all 26
                                                        er.   divisions  with  equipment  and  reserves so that they could proceed  overseas -in  echelons, within a period of say 8 months after  the outbreak of war..  We abandoned this plan on  the grounds  that  it would take too long to carry out, and appeared  to be outside  the scope of the resources which we  can command  within a reasonable period of time. 9.     We  next  considered  a  plan whereby the whole of the existing  13 Territorial Divisions would be provided with war re-serves and potential on a scale which would enable them to  proceed overseas at an average date of say 5 months after  the outbreak of war, the remaining 13 Divisions  being provided with equipment on a war training scale.   On reflection, however,- we reached the conclusion that even this plan would take a long time to carry out, and  that in present circumstances the right course is  to  concentrate on a somewhat more limited objective, which we believe is more likely to give satisfactory  results in the near future.   This plan is th-t we  should  concentrate on providing war reserves and equipment  for 10 Territorial Divisions on a basis which will enable all these Territorial Divisions to proceed overseas, as  early as other factors (  such as the transport problem, and&apos;the need  for a period of intensive training after the outbreak of war) permit. 10.    It  is  an essential feature of this plan that the remaining 16 Territorial Divisions should be provided with equipment on  the full war training scale, and that such arrangements  should be made  in regard to  war potential aswill enable these divisions  to proceed overseas with full warequipment and reserves within 12 months after the  outbreak
 of war.    For this  purpose it is  imperative  to  take immediate  decisions  as  to  those supply elements which require  considerable time  to  bring  into production, viz4 factories  -  gun,  filling,  explosive and propellant. 11.    In  putting forward  this plan, there is one general consideration governing  the&quot;- whole of this problem to which we  should  draw the specific attention of the Cabinet.   Even if  full wor  powers for the control of industry were made immediately  available, a considerable interval must elapse before, on the supply side, any divisions other than those included in  the first Regular contingent could be sent overseas in  a condition  in which they could keep the field. The length of this period depends on the size of the expeditionary force  aimed at  by the plan.   If that force should for example be a  force of 10 Territorial Divisions (plus the  first Regular  contingent) the period before thewhole would be ready  could at the present moment x^robablybe estimated  at least 18 months.12,   We recommend \  that the  question whether war reserves and potential  should be built up on a more extended scale, so as to enable more  than 10 Territorial Divisions toproceed overseas in the months immediately after theoutbreak of war, should be reconsidered when the plan whichwe now recommend is well in hand and we are better able to judge whether we are in  a position to cope with a largerprogramme,  without risk to other requirements from industrysuch as those of the Royal Air Force.
 13.    We  wish  to  emphasise  the vital  need for a prompt decision as to  the  oasis on which  Supply arrangements  are to he made  for the Territorial Army.Without this  no real progress can he made.14.    It  is  clear that the  new basis  for supplyarrangements  now proposed  can only he  carried out by bringing into use  a far larger capacity than that now employed   in  carrying out War Office contracts.   Thefirst duty of the  new Ministry will,  therefore, be toascertain how far  the gap between the  existing and thenew programme can be met by  capacity already inexistence or created for the purpose of the re-armament programme;  how far the gap can be bridgedby utilising or expanding existing industry, with due regard to the needs of other Defence Departments;  and how far it will be necessary for the government itselfto provide factories in addition to what organisedindustry can itself contribute.                     III,    DUTIES, POWERS AND CONSTITUTION OF -iHE Nljjv/ MINISTRY,15,    As will be evident from what we have said above, our recommendation is that the proposed Ministry should, in thefirst instance, concern itself with Army Supply for thelarger forces now authorised.   Circumstances, however, maywell arise which would show that vho new Ministry could with advantage to the public perform certain supply functions forthe other Service Departments,   We recommend that thelegislation necessary should be drawn in sufficiently wide
terms  to  enable this to be done, if thought desirable, withoutthe need  for obtaining further legislative authority.... Ineffect this will mean a Bill empowering the establishmentof a Ministry of Supply, although it would be made clear that.for the time bejng at any  :ate, the Ministry would only be concerned with Army Supply, with the addition of some storesof general user.16.   . The War Office, as the largest common user is atthe present time responsible for providing on an agency basis,a very large quantity of stores for other GovernmentDepartments - both Civil and Defence Departments - and also for the Dominions and India.   In our view not only shou.ldthat system continue, but it is important that the new Ministrrfspowers should be sufficiently flexible to enable this system to be extended, where found desirable.Functions to be assigned to the new Ministry at the outset.17.  .  In our previous memorandum, (paragraph 26 (V)) werecommended &quot;The Ministry of Supply shown ^ld be responsibleonly for  those parts of supply which call for extensivediversion of the engineering, chemical and metallurgicalindustries from their normal spheres.&quot;       It will be evident that the scope of the duties whichwe contemplate should be undertaken by the new Ministry atthe outset will be different in character.    We recommendthat the new Ministry when established should undertakeresponsibility .for all Army Supply generally,  with theexception of certain quartermaster general stores and other services which require further consideration.
 Question of compulsory- powers, 18.    A very  important question  is whether the new Ministry should he entrusted with &quot;compulsory powers&quot;,  in the sense of the powers  exercised in the late war by the Ministry of Munitions - that  is to  say the right to control any establishment  engaged in the production of munitions of War. On this  our view  is as  follows.   Even on the expanded hypothesis which  we recommend should now be authorised for the Army, only a  part of the total capacity of the country will be  required  to satisfy it.   This means that a Ministry entrusted with compulsory powers would be given the invidious duty of  interfering by  compulsion with the normal trade of  one firm and not with that of another. 19.    We do not  recommend that the new Ministry should be invested  with  these powers.   ,We think, however, that a scheme could be devised which would,give the Ministry a statutory right to  enforce the acceptance-of, and  priority for, Government orders.   The  system to give effect to any such scheme would  require very careful consideration.   We suggest however, that power might be given to notify particular establishments thrt any contracts made from a given date in. the future  should  be subject to the Minister&apos;s right to claim priority for Government orders.20.    It will also be  a matter requiring very careful consideration whether the Bill setting up the new Ministry should or  should not include legal powers to determineprices after a costs investigation both as to prices of themain contractor and of  sub-contractors.
Constitution of Ministry.21.    Unless and until the scope of the Ministry as above defined is widened, we think the needs wouldprobably be met by the provision of a Minister and parliamentary Secretary leaving to the decision of theMinister the detailed organization which he will require.Doubtless he might find it desirable to strengthen -theMinistry by enlisting into its service productionexperience not normally found in Government departments and also to provide himself with an advisory industrialcouncil.22.    So far in this paper we have referred totransfer of Army Supply;  but we should make it clearthat we include also transfer of design, research and inspection.    It will, however, have to be specifically laid down and clearly understood that appropriate representatives of the using department will have to be closely associated with those concernedin the supplying department at all stages of design and also in regard to the standards of inspection.23..    We think it essential that the new minister should be in charge of a separate self-containedDepartment and that he should be responsible toParliament for the establishment required for the workentrusted to him.    But it remains to - -set tle-th e. -re 1 a t i on sbetween the new Ministry and tlie-War Office.   The point is best brought to an issue by considering the responsi-bility to Parliament for the expenditure to be incurred by the new Ministry in respect of supply.    Is that expenditure to be a final charge to the Vote for the new ministry, in which case the new Minister will be                    -10-
aoootwit-aoifi for it, or will the expenditure incurred.by the new Ministry in carrying out orders for theWar Office be repaid by the War Office - by means ofappropriations in aid - and form a final charge againstArmy Votes?.   In this latter event while the new minister is responsible for the. methods employed in carrying, outthe orders, he would be in substance an agent, and responsibility for the volume and type of orders placedwould rest with the War Office.24.    This matter was considered in 1919 when it wasin contemplation to set up a Ministry of Supply.    Itwas then decided that a system whereby Department A.placed its orders, hut Department 3 paid the bill, ledto extravagant demands, and that the Agency system shouldbe adopted.   we concur in this decision, and werecommend that the cost of orders placed by the War office with the new Ministry should be refunded to the nev/Ministry &quot;by the War Office as appropriations in  aid.25.    There would necessarily be an exception to thissystem in regard to the provision and ownership of factories.   Such an exception has a parallel in the existing financial arrangements of the Royal Ordnance Factories,and would necessitate provision of money from time totime on the Vote for the Ministry of Supply.26.    There is a further type of expenditure which wethink could be appropriately included in the Estimateof the new Ministry.   Certain reserves of essentialraw materials have been amassed and the cost of  thesehas been provided on the Votes of one or other of theService Departments.   These materials are, however, in
most cases required, not only for safeguarding servicesupplies, but also for maintaining general industryso far as it can be maintained in war conditions.   Therehas thus been considerable difficulty in finding themoney on Service votes, and it cannot be found on the vote of the Board of Trade since the definition of the reserves which that Department was empowered to lay inby the Essential Commodities Reserves Act 1938 is toonarrow. A further survey of the case for reserves of materialsother than those specified in that Act is in progress,and the Sub-Committee  charged with the task is shortlyproposing to the Committee of Imperial Defence freshreserves costing considerable sums which the representativesof the Service Departments are most averse from acceptingas a charge to their votes, and which cannot be charged to the Board of Trade  vote under the Act above referredto.   It seems to us that such sums could be convenientlyborne on the vote for  the new Ministry if established.27.    We recommend, therefore, that there should be a vote covering (i) the  staffing of the Ministry, (ii)the provision of factories and stocks of essentialmaterials and (iii) cost of manufacture;  but that thereshould be appropriated in aid of this vote sums received for sale of supplies to user Departments.28.    We do not think it necessary to specify in detail the branches or sections of the War Office which wouldbe transferred to the  new Ministry.   But it would includethe branches responsible for research, design andexperiment, production and inspection, and the royal ordnance Factories and certain transfers of general service sections, contracts, finance and secretariat.
44       The War Office would still retain the responsibilityfor fixing the requirements of the Army, the general nature,scales and quantity of weapons and equipment, and for theirdistribution to the troops and maintenance.                     IV.         CONTINUANCE OP P.S.O. ORGANISATION, -                 PRIORITY MACHINERY.29.    As there will, under our recommendations continueto be three Service Supply Departments, the existing machinery of the Principal Supply Officers Committee,and of the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee, will continue in being.   &quot;We recommend, however,&quot; that this machinery should be supplemented by a Ministerial Priority Committee,comprising the following Ministers:-       Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.       Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster.       The Three Defence Ministers and the         Minister in charge of the new Department-.       President of the Board of Trade.       Minister of Labour,
