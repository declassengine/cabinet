Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.         I circulate to my colleagues a summary of the reports    submitted to the Board of Trade Advisory Council on the    state of trade in February, 1939.                                         O.P.G.S.Board of Trade,    11th April, 1939.
                BOARD OJJ1 TRADES ADVISORY COUNCIL.               3JATE OF TRAPS AT FEBRUARY, 1959.     Summary of Reports submitted &quot;by the Members of the      Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in      some cases with statistical information from other      sources).     OVERSEAS TRADE;   Imports in February ( 65.5 million) showed a decline of  10.3 million as compared with February, 1958.Imports of raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were 5.4 million less and imports ol food, drink and tooacco  5.million less.  Exports of United Kingdom products ( 38.1 million)were  0.5 million more than in February, 1958.     EMPLOYlviBNT;  There was a marked improvement in employmentbetween the 16th January and 15th February.  It is provisionallyestimated that at the 13th February the number of insured persons,aged 15-64, in employment in Great Britain (inclusive of personsinsured under the agricultural scheme and in the classes of domestic employment which became insurable on 4th April 1938)was 12,222,000.  This figure -was 145,000 more than the figureof employment on the 16th January 1939, and approximately70,000 more than the figure of employment on 14th February, 1938.     RAILWAY TRAFFIC;  For the four weeks ended the 26th February,railway traffic receipts decreased by  531,000 or 4.5 per centas compared with the corresponding period in 1938.     SHIPPING.  There has been a better time charter  demand inrecent weeks particularly in the American section but demand is too low to permit of much improvement in rates.  There has been no expansion in the River Plate &quot;market.  The Chamber  of Shippingindex number of shipping freights for February was 121.5compared with 120.8 in January.  Laid-up tonnage in ports ofGreat Britain and Ireland declined slightly from 455,667 nettons on 1st October 1953 to 452,566 net tons on 1st January,1939.  The  decline in British vessels only was from  363,252net tons to 342,423 net tons.
     SHIPBUILDING; The absence of orders in February for newmerchant shipbuilding caused great anxiety in the industry./But the Governments subsequent statement regarding assistanceto shipping and shipbuilding has resulted in the placing of alarge number of orders for new cargo ships/7   Yards engaged on admiralty work are very busy.     BANKING:  The seasonal movement in deposits has so far been greater than in any year since 1932.  The February averageswere  53-^- millions lees than in January.     The fall in the provincial clearing figures in February ascompared with February, 1933, was only 5.5 per cent;  there hasbeen a progressive decline in the percentage decrease in the clearing figures in recent months as compared with thecorresponding months of the previous j^ear and this tendencycontinued in February.     The money market lias been suffering from an acute shortageof bills:   the average allotment to the market was about 22% ofthe amount for which it tendered.     FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ^jBROAD:  Belgium.  The fall since last year in the value of sterling and the French franc inrelation to the dollar, with which the Belgian currency islinked, has adversely affected Belgian export industries.  This,and recent internal political difficulties, have weakened thebelga:   during the last week of February it remained on goldexport point in relation to the dollar.     Germany.  The economic situation continued to showindications of stress;  there were signs of inflation and thetotal monetary circulation is almost as large as in september and December;     Holland.  The selling movement of florins which had begun in January was continued with intermittent reactions throughoutFebruary.     United States.  Business remained quiet until about themiddle of February when there were signs of a slight improvement.which Y/as maintained  to the end of the month.                          -2-
     ENGINEERING: There was an increase in unemployment in theindustry in January as compared with December but prospects are regarded as not unfavourable.  The recent increased production of iron and steel probably foreshadows greateractivity in engineering.  Preliminary figures of unemploymentfor February show an improvement on January.  Exports ofmachinery in January amounted to 33,224 tons, valued at 4,568,000 as compared with 41,534 tons in January 1938, valued at  4,784,000;  the increase in the average value per tonexported was partly due to rising costs of production.     ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY;  Inquiries and orders for plant were well maintained in February.  Important orders in the Dominionshowever, were secured against severe Continental competitiononly by offering very low prices.     The value of exports of electrical machinery, goods andapparatus was  1,693,000 both in February of this year arid in?ebruary 1938;  the figure for January 1939 was  1,903,000.     The total amount of electricity generated by authorisedundertakings in February showed an increase of nearly 9 per cent over February 1938.     MOTOR INDUSTRY: New registrations in January were 40,001as compared with 38,682 in January 1938.  The estimated numberof vehicles including motor-cycles in use in March 1939 was2,329,800 as compared with 2,175,300 in March 1938.  Exports ofprivate cars and private car chassis in February were 3,741 and1,838 compared with 4,818 and 2,511 respectively in February1938.  The decreases in each case occurred in the trade with british countries.  Imports of private cars from France haveshown an increase in recent months;  in February they number321 as compared with 35 in February 1938.     N0N-FERR0U3 METALS:  Markets remained quiet and steadyduring February;  prices tended to rise towards the end of themonth owing to increasing business confidence in the UnitedStates and to the decision of His majesty&apos;s Government to borrowon a large scale for defence in 1939-1940.
     GOAL:  There has been little change in the coal trade inFebruary.  There is usually a time-lag in the effects on thecoal trade of changes in the conditions of the principal coal-using industries, and despite slightly improved conditions in manufacturing industries  the latest available statistics, bothof coal production and of demand for coal, show further declines.     In the export trade the market is very depressed.Continental import restrictions are being maintained and demand is being met more and more by native coals;  in France, forinstance, production of coal in January increased by 600,000metric tons as compared with January, 1958.     Discussions are continuing in connection with the proposed international Coal Cartel.     CHEMICALS:   There was in February a general feeling that trade was improving.  Confidence was growing.  Demand improvedfor a wide range of products, notably for chlorine products,sulphuric acid,  and chemicals required by the artificial silkindustry and dyestuffs;  the demand for coal tar productscontinues, however, to be unsatisfactory.     COTTON:  There was a distinct improvement in the volume ofbusiness, output and employment in the cotton industry during february, mainly owing to increased demand from the home market.The improvement  was to some extent seasonal.  The index ofcotton yarn output per working day rose from 91 in January  to96 in February (1935 s 100).  Sales of yarn  in February were inexcess of production and were increasing during the month.  Atthe beginning of March the volume of orders booked wasexceptionally great in comparison with the experience of thelast 12 months.   The expansion in weaving and finishing appearsto have been less than the expansion in yarn production.     Exports of yarn increased by 16 per cent, in volume ascompared with February 193G but exports of piece goods declinedby 8 per cent.                              -4-
     HOSIERY:   Trade  shows  improvement in most sections, partly on  account  of Government contracts placed in recent months.     WOOL:   There was a slight  improvement in the general activity  of the  industry during February, though conditions in the worsted were less satisfactory than in the woollen  section of  the  industry.  An  improvement  is reported in the volume of orders  and  enquiries  for further business both in the home mid foreign markets, but  considerable competition from Italian piece-goods is  reported in  the  home market.     RETAIL TRADE;    The money  value of average daily sales in January was 0.1 per cent higher than in January 1933.   The index number  of retail sales in Great Britain fell from 133 in December  to 98  in January.  The fall was somewhat larger than the usual seasonal decline  between December and January.     Average daily sales of food and perishables declined in value by 0.3 per cent, in January as compared with January 1933 largely because retail prices had fallen by nearly 4 per cent. in the  course of the year.     Average daily sales of non-food merchandise were 0.5 per cent higher than in January 1938.  This compares with a decline of 0.3  per  cent in the trade year February 1938 to January 1939.     Returns for February 1939  are still scanty but the indications  are that  sales  in February make a better showing as compared with the figures for 12 months earlier than do those for January.     AUSTRALIAN TRADE:  Bales of wool received into store during  the  seven months ended 31st January, amounted to 2,364,800 of which 1,615,575 were disposed of by sale and shipment.   The figures for  the  corresponding period of  theprevious year were 2,546,082 and 1,451,283.     From the commencement  of the wheat season on the 1st December, 1938, to the  25th February, 1959, wheat and flour shipments amounted to 24,643,325 bushels compared with 30,802,995 bushels for the  same period a year earlier.                         -5-
                                                           -4* 0     Imports of merchandise in January, 1939 were valued at A.10,312,000, compared with  All,4-61,0G0 in January 1938.     CANADIAN TRADE:  The chief factors which indicate the trend of economic conditions were on an average lower inJanuary than in December;  the index of the physical volume ofbusiness declined from 115.6 in December to 113.0 in January.Exports from Canada were, however, higher in January than  inDecember or in January, 1938.     SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE:  The latest statistics show that,except for the gold mining industry, economic conditionsdeveloped less satisfactorily in 1938 thanin 1937.     Exports of South African goods, excluding gold and specie,were 2.1 per cent higher in value in January 1939 than inJanuary 1938.  Imports, excluding Government stores and specie,fell by 11.3 per cent.     SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE:  An acute shortage of foreign exchangecontinues in the majority of South American countries, and  isin most cases resulting in increasingly severe restrictions on imports.     Argentine.  There was a favourable trade balance of11,588,000 pesos in Januairy as compared with a favourable balance of 193,000 pesos in January, 1938.  The 1938-39Argentine wheat crop is estimated at 8,600,000 tons, the secondlargest figure on record, and it is feared that it may not bepossible to dispose of the whole crop.  The operation of theexchange restrictions, and the strained trade relations which exist between Argentina and the U.S.A., afford British exportersan opportunity for improving their position in the Argentinianmarket.     Brazil.    An agreement has been concluded by which theUnited States will provide a credit up to $129 million forBrazil.  This is likely to lead to a decline in Germancommercial influence in Brazil.     Uruguay.  Import permits for British goods are only beinggranted sparingly.  Importers of German goods can obtain all theexchange they require.
