Vf                             CABINET.                    ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE  (EMERGENCY                           PROVISIONS)  BILL.                    Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.                      I circulate herewith to  my  colleagues a draft               of a  Bill containing such provisions  as  appear to  the               Home  Secretary and myself to be necessary to enable the               courts  of justice to function  during a  war.                      Clauses 1 to 5(l)  and Clause 6(l) and (2) give               power to the Lord Chancellor, with such  concurrence as               is required by Clause 6(5), to  make, orders and rules of               court with regard to the  Supreme Court,  inferior courtss               circuits and assizes, the Court of Criminal Appeal and               the Central Criminal Court.    Clause 5(2) gives an               analogous power to the Home Secretary as respects               Quarter Sessions and Courts of  Summary Jurisdiction.               These powers will enable  the Courts to be moved, if need               be, to places  outside the danger  zones,  so far as  this               may be possible.                      Clause  6(3) and (4) enables the Lord  Chancellor               to delegate certain of his powers  so  that  they  can be               exercised by other judges, if that should become               necessary owing to an interruption of communications               between one part of the country and  another.   Clause  6(8)               gives to the Home Secretary an analogous power  of               delegation.
       Clause 7 reduces the number of jurors  requiredto form a jury and extends the age limit for  jurors;   andClause 8 restricts the right to trial by jury in civil proceedings, as in the last War.       Clause 9 modifies the law with regard  to theremanding of accused persons.       Clause 10 modifies the statutory obligation to fill  judicial raeancieso       The Bill has been prepared in consultation witha representative committee of Judges of the Supreme Courttogether with the Law Officers and a representative ofthe Law Society.       I ask my colleagues to approve the principle ofthe Bill, and to authorise its  consideration by the HomeAffairs Committee on the footing  that it is to beintroduced  into Parliament and passed into law, ifpossible, in peace time, but  come into  operation onlyon  the making of an Order  in Council under Clause ll(2).
