                  BOARD OF- TRADE ADVISORY COTTNOTL                    STATE OF TRADE - March.1959.     Summary of Reports submitted by Members of the Board of Trade       Advisory Council (supplemented in some eases with       statistical information from other sources).     OVERSEAS TRAPS.   Imports in March ( 78.0 million) showed adecline of  6.9 million as compared with March, 1958. Imports ofraw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  4.4 million less and imports of food, drink and. tobacco  1.4 million less.Exports of United Kingdom products ( 41.6 million) were  5 million less than in March,  1958.     RAILWAY TRAFFIC.  In the four weeks ended the 26th March, 1939,railway traffic receipts decreased by  501,000 or 2.5 per cent.as compared with the corresponding period, of 1938.     The total receipts for the twelve weeks ended the 26th *March,showed a decrease of  1,739,000 or 5.1 per cent,  as compared withthe corresponding period of 1958.     EMPLOYMENT. There was a further improvement in employmentbetween the 13th February and&apos;the 13th March which extended toalmost every industry.     It is provisionally estimated, that at the 13th March thenumber of insured persons, aged 16 to 64 (including those insuredunder the agricultural scheme and In the classes or domesticemployment which became insurable at the 4th April, 1938) inemployment in Great Britain was approximately 12,405,000.  Thiswas 181,000 more than at the 15th February 1939  and approximately180,000 more then at  the 14th March, 1938.     SHIPPING. The Easter holidays and political uncertaintieshave caused a decline in business, though the expected resumptionof the trade in scrap between the United States  and the UnitedKingdom is a welcome  sign.     The Chamber of Shi oping  index&apos;number of shipping freight(1955=100) fell from  121.5 in February to 117.0  in March;  thecorresponding figure  for March 1953 is 127.5.     SHIPBUILDING. There has been little change  in the positionof the shipbuilding industry during March, but since  the government&apos;s proposals for assisting the industry  were announceo
                                                            ISOat  the  end  of the month reports have appeared in the Press ofthe placing of 39 mercantile contracts.  In most districts navalshipbuilding is proceeding at a steady pacei                   FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.    Belgium. The ordinary &quot;budget for 1939 shews a deficit of  300,000,000 francs and the extraordinary budget, which covers  expenditure on public works and armaments, a deficit ofover 2,000,000,000 frunes.   The deficit in the ordinary budgetcan be met by economies but the extraordinary budget will havetc be balanced, it is thought, either by borrowing or bydevaluing the belga.  conditions in the money market areunfavourable to borrowing;  devaluation would, on the other handstimulate Belgian ex-ports which have suffered from the depreciation of sterling and the French franc in terms of gold.     During most of March the belga was at gold export pointin relation to the dollar and forward discounts tended toincrease *    China.  The announcement  of the establishment of what may be described as an exchange equalisation account for Chinasupported by a British guarantee caused a rise in the quotationsfor Chinese currency on the Shanghai market.  It is thoughtthat the Japanese attempt to enforce the use of the Japanesesponsored &quot;federated reserve&quot; currency at an exchange rate ofl/2d. for financing experts from Tientsin will prove unworkable0   France.  The increase in industrial activity is gatheringmomentum. Fiscal receipts are shewing a satisfactory increase.   Germany.  At the end of March the total of Reichsbankcredit assets reached the record level of 9,207,000,000 Rm.of which 8,180,000,000 Rm. consist of bills, mainly armamentbills.  The currency in circulation reached a new peak at10,497,000,000 Rms.  The balance of trade was unfavourable toGermany in the first two months of the year.   United States of America.   Business conditions during march showed only a little improvement on the previous month.,
     NON-FERROUS METALS.  Metal prices improved slowly duringthe first part of March, hut in the middle of the month theinternational situation caused a sharp fall, particularly inthe price of copper;  There was some recovery in prices &quot;beforethe end of the month.   Demand in the United Kingdom has been fairly good.     CHEMICALS.  The demand for heavy chemicals was better inMarch than for some time past, except as regards tar products;there was an improved demand for chlorine products, mineralacids, dyestuffs, and chemicals for the rayon industry.     ENGINEERING.   Unemployment in the engineering industrydeclined from 8.5 per cent, in January to 7.9 per cent, inFebruary,  and to 7.4 per cent, in March.   The relative lackof civil orders is  at present balanced by orders for workconnected with the  re-armament programme, but the intensification of re-armament work may make it difficult for the industry tomaintain its export  trade.   For the first two months of 1939,exports of machinery amounted to 68,000 tons valued at 9,089,000 as compared with 77,000 tons valued at  9,348,000in the corresponding period of 1958.     COAL.  There was a slight improvement  in the coal industryin March.   In the  home market the demand for coal for domestic consumption and for public utility undertakings, particularly for the generation  of electricity, was well maintained;  thedemand for industrial fuels was further stimulated by theexpansion in the iron and steel industry.     The export position has not materially changed, but exportsto Germany have been unusually large;  the north-easterndistricts have benefited most from this increase of trade.     Further discussions in regard to the contemplatedInternational Coal  Agreement have been deferred for the timebeings     MOTOR INDUSTRY.  New registrations of mechanicallypropelled vehicles  in February were 35,907, an increase of3,575 as compared with February, 1938.                           -3-
    CpjTTpJT^ The improvement in business which began inJanuary was maintained in the first half of March,  butthere was a relapse after the international developments ofthe middle of the month.  Though the volume of buying was reduced in the latter half of the month, production was only very slightly affected.- The improvement in demand appearsto have come mainly from the home market: most export marketsremain depressed.     The volume of new orders for yarns at the beginning ofMarch was greater than at any time since the beginning of1937; though the international crisis caused a decline inpurchases, the volume of orders did not fall below the levelreached in February.  The provisional index of cotton yarnoutput per working day in March was 103  (1935=100) as comparedwith 96 in February and 91 in March, 1938.  This is the first time since the end of 1937 that output has been greater thanin the corresponding month of the previous year.     Employment statistics indicate that activity increased in weaving and finishing, as well as in  spinning.     WOOL. There were further increases  in activity in boththe woollen and worsted sections of the  industry in March.It is expected that orders for khaki and other uniform clothswill increase in the near future but as  regards civil enquiriesbuyers seem hesitant to place orders beyond immediate requirements.     HOSIERY. The uncertainties of the political situationhave had an adverse effect on ordinary business, but there isa satisfactory volume of work on Government contracts.  Unlesswork of this kind lasts longer than is  expected, the industry may be unfavourably affected in the autumn.
     RETAIL TRADER  The money value of average daily saleswas 2.3 per cent, higher in February, 1939, than in February,1938.   Average daily sales of food and perishables increased  in value by 1,5 per cent, in February as compared with February,1938, in spite of a fall in food prices of over 5 per cent,  inthe course of the year.   Average daily sales of non-foodmerchandise were 3.8 per cent, higher in February, 1939  than inFebruary, 1938.     The increase in the value of average daily sales inFebruary, 1939, as compared with February, 1938, was greater thanthe increase for the trade year February 1938 - January  1939 ascompared with the preceding trade year.   The downward trend of sales of merchandise in central London was less marked than in previous&apos; months.     Preliminary returns for March indicate that retail  trade  was maintained at about the level of March, 1938 in most areas.     CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (SCOTLAND):  Retail buyers of clothingare reluctant to make large purchases in anticipation of future requirements, probably owing to the unsettled international situation.   The productive factories allied to the DraperyDepartment of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society have,however, been busy.     Sales of furniture, especially of the cheaper grades,have also been good in Scotland,     AUSTRALIAN TRADE:   Bales of wool received into store duringthe eight months ended 28th February 1939 amounted to2,981,000 as compared with 2,601,000 in the corresponding perioda year earlier;  the quantities disposed of by sale or shipmentwere respectively 2,933,000 and 1,776,000.     Shipments of wheat and flour, expressed as bushels  of wheat,were 32,066,000 bushels in the period from the 1st December, 1938,to the 25th March 1939, as compared with 48,559,000 bushels inthe corresponding period a year earlier,                               -5-
     Exports of &quot;butter from the 1st July 1933 to  the1st April 1939 were 76,000 tons as compared with  71,000  tonsin the corresponding period a year earlier; exports to  theUnited Kingdom were 72,000 and 69,000 tons  respectively.                Although the index of the physical volumeof business fell from 113.0 in January/ to 111.7 in february the February figure was better than a year earlier andeconomic conditions generally were better than in January.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE. Exports of South African goods otherthan gold and specie were 9.2 per cent, higher in February,1939, than in February, 1938; imports were 9.5 per cent,  lower.     The quarterly index of wholesale prices showed a declinefrom  1,125 in October, 1938 to 1-,114 in January, 1939(January 1914 ^ 1,000).SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.  ARGENTINA. There was a favourable balance of trade of 33,373,000 pesos in February, as comparedwith a favourable balance of 11,818,000 pesos in January,and an adverse balance of 6,241,000 pesos in December,  1938.The improvement in the balance is chiefly due to a decline  in imports.  The tonnage of cereals shipped from Argentina duringthe first two months in 1939 was larger than in the correspondingperiod of 1938, but much lower prices prevailed.BRAZIL.  Following the recently signed Commercial Agreementbetween Brazil and the United States, which gave certain credit facilities to Brazil, Brazilian banks are authorised topurchase 70% of their export Bills at a free market rate.  Theeffect should be to reduce the delays consequent upon paymentthrough the Central Bank.  The export surplus in 1938 was(in gold  s) only  29,000, as compared with  1,922,000 in 1937and  9,004,000 in 1936.  The . decline in the surplus waslargeljr due to the fall in the price of primary products.CHILE.  A favourable trade balance declined from 513,000,000gold pesos in 1937 to 180,200,000 gold pesos in 1938.JCQLOMBJA,  Business prospects for 1939 are regarded withoptimism.
