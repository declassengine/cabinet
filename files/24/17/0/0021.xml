Ships have been sunkso far as longitude 19&quot; W.. 300 and 400 miles from Ireland, and the coast of Francerespectively.
2The losses have been distributed as follows Channel, 9; South and West of:Ireland, 7; Bay of Biscay, 6; North and West &quot;of Scotland, 5; Mediterranean, 4 ;Atlantic, North of&apos; 02o, 2 ; ,and Spanish. Coast, 2..; - . -The North Atlantic convoy which &quot;sailed from the United States on the 4th Juneis. due in, port on the 20th June. Two more are en route, one having left on the13th June, and the other consisting of eighteen ships on the 19th.The losses in the Mediterranean are still high, if it be taken into considerationthat a large proportion of the Eastern trade has been deflected from the Canal to theCape route, and that consequently an average of only about five British merchant-shipsenter the Mediterranean from , the United Kingdom per day. From the 9th April tothe 31st May, thirty-seven British and thirty-eight Allied and neutral vessels weresunk, which corresponds to an average of about one and a half per day. The Frenchand Italians have put forward plans for blocking the Otranto Straits by obstructionsconsisting of nets, &amp;c, moored to the bottom, and, if this can be done efficiently,the protection of trade in tho Mediterranean will be greatly simplified, but thedifficulties are very great owing to the depth of water. The amount of materialrequired is also very large, and as we have been asked to supply it British officershave been sent out to report on the practicability of the scheme.- It has recently been approved to adopt,a system of convoys in the Mediterraneancombined with the use of coast routes by night, and to invest the control of all trafficin a central authority at Malta. This authority will be composed of officers of theAllied Navies under a Biitish Admiral.As regards enemy mining by U.C. boats, with the exception of the East Coastbetween St. Abb&apos;s Head and Cromer, where no mines have been laid, normal activitylias been experienced; 116 German moored mines have&quot;been swept up, which is aboutthe weekly average.Twenty-three encounters with enemy submarines- have been reported during thepast week, and it is probable that two submarines were destroyed.Operations in the North Sea.The armed merchant cruiser &quot;Avenger,&quot; of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, was sunkby a submarine between Faroe Islands and North of Scotland on the 14th June. The&quot;Hilary&quot; met a similar fate on the 25th May. . The question of the withdrawal ofsome of the ships of the 10th Cruiser Squadron is now under consideration.On the 13th June, in accordance with instructions received from the Admiralty,the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, issued orders for the disposal of four flotillaleaders, forty-four destroyers, twelve submarines, various auxiliary patrol vessels,seaplanes, and airships for intercepting German submarines returning north-aboutfrom attacking trade in the Atlantic as well as those on passage to the Atlantic. Theresulting dispositions appear to have been taken up. on the loth, and will probablyremain in force for some days.During the week a small mine-field was laid in the proclaimed area of the NorthSea. Defects in the mine-sinkers have, however, been discovered, thus preventing thecontinuance of these operations, but tbey will be resumed this week. During theshort nights, only the small fast mine-layers can.be used, as the larger and slower oneswould be exposed to too great risks. The delay due to the defective sinkers will allowa stock of mines to accumulate, and laying of lines of deep mines with fixed mooringsto catch submarines working on the south coast to be proceeded with.&quot;Reports from Holland show that two German merchant-ships engaged on costaltraffic were blown up on our mine-fields during the week.Operations in Dover Area.During the week a squadron of the R.N.A.S. bombed St. Denis Westrem aerodrome,many direct hits being observed, and a successful raid was also made on the shippingin Bruges harbour. On the 17th June, H.M. torpedo-boat destroyer &quot; Tartar&quot; strucka mine, her bow being blown away and back broken.It was intended to carry out a bombardment, from the sea, of Ostend docks andremaining workshops on the morning of the 19th June, but the monitors, &amp;c, had toreturn owing to the wind being in an unfavourable direction. i
Operations in the East/Indies.TheCommander-m-Chief, East Indies, reports an attack by H:M. ships on Sa]ifa small harbour m the Yemen, on the 12th June. The operations were successful -several Turkish prisoners a few machine-guns,. &amp;c., were captured, also some harbourplant belonging to Sir J. Jackson and Co. ,3These operations are the outcome of a request by the Idrisi, the Arabian ruler oftne i emen, for British, assistance against the Turks. i&amp;r&apos;Summary of Naval Intelligence.Movements of German Merchant Ships.To and from Norwegian ports : Arrived, 4.   Sailed, 5.To and from Rotterdam : Arrived, 10.   Sailed, 11.Estimated total imports of German coal, coke, and briquettes to Sweden in May is200,000 tons.Export of Swedish, ore from Oxelosund to Germany^: Week ending the 19th May, 1917, 28,441 tons.Week ending the 2nd June, 1917, 31,875 tons.Weekly Intelligence Report, June 19, 1917.Swedish-German Ore Trade via Baltic.It is reported that the Germans have purchased 2,500,000 tons of Swedish, oref.o.b. Lulea, to be carried in German ships. The French. Government think it may bepossible for the Russian Fleet seriously to harass this traffic, and the French.Ambassador at Petrograd has been instructed to press this matter upon the attentionof the Russian Government. His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir G.Buchanan to act with his French colleagues.Christiania, May 31, 1917.The following is an extract from a conversation a man named Heinrich WillielmNaumann had with- the Military Attache. Naumann is said to be a deserter from theGerman Admiralty: &quot; He states that every day, except Mondays, a convoy leaves Swinemiinde forLandsort (north of Oxelosund), which takes coal to Sweden, and is escorted by two-mine-sweepers of the new &quot; M&quot; class and two or three patrol fishing-boats, and thatthese return from Landsort. to Germany every day, except Thursdays, bringing backiron ore.&quot;Naval Staff,June 20, mt
