Each Committee, has accordinglybeen supplied with figures showing(a) the total corn area suggested for 1918,(b) the increase in the corn area compared with 1916,(c) the estimated area of permanent grass to be ploughedt(d) the percentage of the total arable area of 1918 to bedevoted to corn crops.A reduction in the area of grass land required to bebroken up has had to be sanctioned in view of the delay inobtaining the necessary labour for ploughing in May and June.The fact, however, that larger quantities of corn are to be grownIn Ireland and Scotland than were anticipated at the time that theoriginal programme was framed enables this reduction to be madewithout serious detriment to national security.m lo j

The Norfolk Committee have orderedthe Middle Level Drainage Commissioners to keep open their sluiceat Cross Waters Staunch on the Ouse twelve hours a day owing to thewater logging of lands above the sluice.The West Sussex Committee have made careful inspection bymeans of a Sub-Committee of the works required to Improve thedrainage of lands in the valleys of the Adur, Arun and Rother, andhave prepared reports in some detail;   they propose taking actionon the reports as far as the supply of labour permits.The Horti: Riding Committee have invited the co-operation^of the East Riding Committee and the Iforth Eastern Railway Companywith regard to the drainage In the Berwent Valley.The Flintshire Committee are taking action under theDrainage of Lands Orders In order to Improve the drainage of landadjoining the London and North Western main line and the alkaliworks at Bedol and near Flint.
Rabbits.Several of the Committees, especially Buckinghamshire,Kesteven, Norfolk and West Suffolk report that definite measureshave been taken in particular cases under the Rabbits Order,Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2)IReports from 957 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that176,088 applications for plots have been made, and that 158,755plots, containing a total area of 11,838 acres, have beenprovided under the Order.HORTICULTURAL SECTION.30 Horticultural Representatives have been appointedduring the week bringing the total up to 471.   In Staffordshirearrangements have been made for a Conference betweon theHorticultural Representatives and the County HorticulturalInstructor, with the object of co-ordinating horticultural work inthe County.   From reports received daily it is evident that theRepresentatives are doing valuable work in encouraging the increaseof food production.   Information has been received during the weekof the formation of a further 16 Village Food Production Societies.Since the issue of the circular on this subject 80 societieshave been formed.Potato Spraying.     The total number of orders received forKnapsack Spraying Machines now amounts to 4,552, together with24,114 cases of Spraying Material.   The number of machines actuallydespatched by manufacturers is 1,387 and approximately 20,000 casesof material have also been despatched.During the week many demonstrations and lectures havobeen held in different parts of the country.   Reports have beenreceived from various districts of an alleged outbreak of &quot;lateblight&quot; of potatoes.   Specimens examined show that the reportsare unfounded. The injury in most cases has been caused by anattack of insect pests.
Drying of Vegetables and Pulping of Fruit.   Estimates of theexpenditure involved in        carrying out the scheme of VegetableDrying and Fruit Pulping, which was described in the Report datedthe 6th June, have been submitted to the Treasury, Breweries andother buildings likely to prove suitable as Fruit Drying Stationshave been inspected in various parts of the country.   Enquiriesinto the supply of barrels available for pulping indicate that thesupply of suitable barrels in the country is short and it willprobably prove necessary for the Department itself to undertakethe organisation of the collection of barrels.A number of firms have expressed their willingness totake up Drying and Pulping provided that some assistance, either inthe form of a guarantee, or an advance of capital, is forthcoming.A scheme has consequently been submitted to the Treasury to enablethe Department to afford encouragement to private firms in theform of a guarantee for the disposal of their produce.TECHNICAL DIVISION.High Explosives as Manures^ At the request of the Army Council aninvestigation is being made into the question of using asfertilisers the surplus stocks of propellants and high explosiveswhich will be available after the war. Preliminary pot trials withcordite are in-, progress at the Eothamsted Experimental Station. Thisis the most interesting development in the adaptation of war materialsince Cincinnatus re-converted his sword into a ploughshare.Lime.   A draft scheme of experiments respecting the use of limein agriculture has been prepared and will be brought to thenotice of County Education Authorities.Bye-products from Cheese and Butter Factories.   A memorandumcontaining suggestions for the better use of whey and separatedmilk (large quantities of which.are now often wasted) has been sentto creameries and cheese factories and to Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees. It has been suggested that, in cases where the suppliesof v/hey are largely in excess of the local consuming capacity,
dairy managers should, if possible, undertake the feeding of pigs,l-        and full directions on this point have been given.Seed Mixtures.   An investigation for the purpose of ascertainingthe best &quot;seeds&quot; mixtures for use in different districts is inprogress.   For the purpose of obtaining information as regardsmixtures actually sown over a series of years, visits are beingpaid to farmers, agricultural colleges, etc., and during the pastweek a number of centres in Devon and Cornwall have been visited.LABOUR.Agricultural Labour and Military Service.     The Government decisionnot to take for the Army any more men already employed on farms inEngland without the consent of the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees has had the effect of greatly stimulating theCommittees in their efforts to prepare for the increased cultiva-tion required for the 1918 Harvest.   This is evidenced from thefollowing extract from a letter received from the West SussexCommittee:-&quot;The concession made by the War Office as regards menengaged on farm work ?/ill do more to increase the foodsupply than any other thing that has happened in the historyof the War Agricultural Committees.   The Committees werealways faced with a shortage of labour and also with aponstant withdrawal of the best men and the confidence of the&quot;farmer, was shaken and it was impossible to make them doanything that would involve more labour.&quot;Harvest Labour.   The scheme for the distribution and employmentof the Civilian Labour obtained by the National Service Departmentand the Soldier Labour lent by the Army Council for the hay andcorn harvest has been issued to all Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees.   As regards the soldier labour special DistributionCentres have been selected and the soldiers will be    moved tothese Centrjes from which they will be sent out to farmers.     The(i      movement of the men to the Distributing Centres in the Eastern
the Northern and -Yestem Commands on the 25th instant.The number of soldiers to be lent for the hay harvest is12,700, and for the corn harvest 17,000.   The National ServiceDepartment has beeniuformed by this Department of the number of menrequired to be allocated to each county.Agricultural Companies.   A new Army Council Instruction has beenissued by the War Office, providing that the full establishment ofthe authorised number of companies should be kept at the disposalof the Board of Agriculture, and that so far as possible men postedto these companies should have a knowledge of agriculture.Prisoners of War.   Arrangements have now been made by which anadditional number of Military Prisoners of War will be availablefor agricultural work.   All Agricultural Executive Ccrimittees haveaccordingly been urged to forward at an early date further schemesfor their employment.   One new scheme for the employment of abatch of prisoners has been sent to the War Office during the week,and in the case of three of the schemes already in existenceadditional men are being asked for.Horses.     With the object of retaining an adequate supply ofhorses on the land, a regulation has been made under the Defenceof the Realm Consolidation Act prohibiting an occupier of anagricultural holding from selling or parting with any horse usedor capable of being used for the cultivation of the holding exceptunder licence.   The Board have delegated to the ExecutiveCommittees the power to issue licences for such sales.WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.Detailed returns have been received during the weekrespecting 4,421 women enrolled under the National Service Schemefor work on the land.   These show that 1,549 were actually beingemployed in farm work;   1,799 undergoing training;   591 waiting tobe placed in Training Centres, and the remainder waiting for
employment.   Since these returns were received, however,information has been obtained that the women waiting for traininghave all been dealt with, and of those waiting for employment 198have actually been placed on farms.There is evidence of an increased demand for women-workers in all parts of the country, even in counties likeCumberland and Westmorland where hitherto the efforts to extendthe employment of women on farms have met with little success. Somecounties report that the shortage of women workers is becomingserious.   In one case it is stated that the increased demand forwomen Is largely 07/ing to the satisfactory work done by thosealready in employment.   The facilities available for training womenare such that at the present tinte approximately 1,750 can bepassed through training centres or practice farms each month.   Inview of this fact and of the increasing demand for women workersit is highly desirable that the number of women enrolling forwork on the land should be greatly augmented.MACHINERY AND IMPLEMENTS.Motor Tractors.   No further tractors have been received since theReport for the week ending June&apos;6th, but 517 of the 626 mentionedIn that Report have now been actually allocated to CountyCommittees.   The number of ploughs purchased by the Departmentnow amounts to 834.   During the week a further 7 of the privately-owned tractors have been returned, leaving 76 still under theDepartments control.Horse-drawn Potato Spraying Machines.    Orders were placed by theDepartment some weeks ago for 100 horse-drawn potato sprayingmachines.   Arrangements have been made during the week for theallocation of these machines to the Executive Committees incounties in which potatoes are grown on a large scale.   These
Committees have &quot;been asked to prepare schemes at once to securethat the spraying machines owned by farmers in their area, as wellas those placed at their disposal by the Department, will be usedto their maximum capacity during the next few weeks, which is theonly period when spraying is of value.SUPPLIES.A circular letter is being issued to Supplies Sub-Committees urging them to proceed with the appointment of ApprovedAgents for Sulphate of Ammonia and other agricultural requirements,and explaining the conditions on which such agents are to beappointed.   As soon as these Agents have been appointed theExecutive Committees will be able to refer farmers requiringsupplies to them, and in the event of these Approved Agents beingunable to obtain supplies through the usual channels, the Departmentwill see that they are supplied whenever possible.Sulphate of. Ammonia.   Manufacturers have now been invited by theirAssociation to agree to an equalisation scheme in respect ofsulphate of ammonia for export, which should greatly facilitatedistribution for home use.Lime *   An arrangement has been made with the Ministry of Munitionswhereby a large quantity of waste lime, produced in the manufactureof ammonium nitrate will be utilised for agricultural purposes.The Department has agreed to purchase this waste lime at a priceof 1/6 per ton, the necessary machinery for removing it from theworks being erected by the Ministry of Munitions. . This, waste limewhich is likely to prove to be a very useful dressing for the landwill be sold to farmers at about 7/6 per ton f,o.r.An arrangement is being made with a firm of limeproducers near London to instal a machine for pulverising chalkwith a vie?/ to its disposal at an agreed price in the South Easterncounties.   The cost of the installation of the machinery will be&apos;
borne in the first instance by this Department, and recovered bya fixed charge per ton on the selling price. The firm will bearall expenses of manufacture and distribution.steps to be taken to increase the production. Enquiries are beingmade with a view to obtaining oifers of lime which can be soldto Agricultural Executive Committees in bulk at reduced prices,and the Agricultural Executive Committees have been.asked to statewhat quantities they will be able to dispose of in their districts.Seed Wheat.   A scheme for securing a reserve of seed of the 1916crop suitable for sowing in the early autumn is now in operation.The Ministry of Food has been asked to sanction the sale of theseed at a price which will cover expenses, and the SuppliesSub-Committees in each county have been invited to collect ordersfrom farmers.Arrangements are also being made to purchase up to100,000 quarters of certain varieties of seed wheat of the 1917crop for autumn sowing, at a price not exceeding 18/- per quarterabove that fixed for milling wheat;   growers of the requiredvarieties have been invited to supply the Department withparticulars of standing crops which they are willing to offer forinspection by the Selection Committee.Seed Rye and Winter Oats. The Ministry of Food are being asked toissue an Order requiring that all rye and all winter oats of the1917 crop suitable for seed be reserved for seed purposes untilthe end of October 1917.A conference has been held with lime firms rogarding theI am,   Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.
