V.   Letter dated 20/6/17 from the Ministry of Shippingto the Secretary to the War dabinct.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,With referenco to your official letter of the 14th June30/B/5 respecting the conveyance of horses from Australia toIndia, I am afraid I cannot quite agree with you that thetonnage involved is neither very large nor required immediately.7 or 0 large steamers of a total.deadweight of 50,000 -60,000 tons would be required for about 10 months to carry outthe job.    Each ship would require to make 4 trips and as alltho horses are wanted In India by the end of April nest, theships ought to arrive in Australia early in August for the firstconsignment.   You will thus -see that is essential for us toselect steamers almost immediately if the horses are to beconveyed.I am still of opinion that the matter is of sufficientimportance to warrant the consideration&quot;of the War Gabinet andI shall bo glad if you can submit it for decision at aa earlya date as practicable.Yours s incer ely,(Signed) J.P.Maclay.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.22nd.June, 1917.
