This route will carryabout 36,Ouu tons of the $aval end Military material per monthfor Salonica and Egypt, leaving about 15,000 tons a month ofsuch material to be carried by sea route.In addition, the following methods v/hereby the quantity ofshipping allotted to the above e poditions may be reduced aresuggested.INCREASED P,A?IDITY OB TUixK ^PUBD OF VESSELS.The Shipping Controller believes that the shipping serviceon the above routes is now so efficiently organised and run that,unless the demand for tonnage is curtailed, no reduction ofshipping is possible.   This state of affairs has been broughtabut largely through expert Inspectors who have spent months atthe principal ports on those routes and done their best toco-ordinate and speed up tho various services..I am convinced that the best results will follow a vigorousand continuous system of inspection.It is now some months since the shipping experts returnedfrom Salonica and Alexandria, and I have therefore arranged thatfurther visits should be made - not only to those ports, but alsoto Gaza, Basra, Bombay and East Africa.   The Shipping Controller,who agrees with me in this, hr?;;. undertaken to despatch highlyqualified Inspectors to these places.I. USIKG AUSTPxiLIAg/rar *:EALAiJD iED lijUTH &amp;F3ICAif DRAFTS IIjMESOPOTAMIA AiJ-D EGYPT TI^TSaITv^ SSlMilG mm- TO THT^ES^EHH FROHT.iit prosent drafts are coming from the Dominions to fill upthe gaps on tho Western front, while at the same time drafts arcbein^ sent from JSoglaad to repair wastage in E^ypt and Mesopotamia,This systom seems to involve an unnecessary amount of trsnopor-tation.It is suggested that in view of the gravity of the shippingsituation and the undesirability of moving,drafts to and froacross submarine-infested seas, it may be possible to useAustralian, iiew Zealand and ^outh African drafts for service inMesopotamia and 3gy?t, while the English drafts, destined forthese campaigns, could be sent instead to the Western Front,
The idea, which is approved by the Adjutant-General, is to move cadres of the Australian, New Zealand, and South African units from the Western front to Mesopotamia and Egypt, whither  in future all drafts for those units will proceed. The effect wi11 be that these units wi11 gradually be built up afresh in those theatres  while the number of Dominion units in France will gradually be diminished.

Simultaneously the reverse process will take place with regard to British units which have hitherto proceeded to the distant theatres, and by the beginning of next year a more or less complete transfer of these Dominion   units will have been effected.

The Adjutant-General points out that this arrangement, if initiated during the coming Autumn, would be well timed, because, roughly speaking, fighting on the western Front diminishes in activity in November and therefore the stopping of Australian drafts in Egypt, on their way Westward, would not matter so much from the Western point of view.  Activity in the East, on the other hand, increases in November, and the addition of the Australian units would be opportune.

An additional argument in favour of this Suggestion is that troops from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia are better equipped than the English drafts to stand the climate of Palestine and Mesopotamia.

The Adjutant-General awaits the instructions of the War Cabinet before authorising this transfer of units. It would be proper to inform the Dominion Governments concerned in advance of the intended action and the reasons for it.

III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY IN THE AREAS ADJACENT TO SPHER?S OF OPERATION.

The Quarter-Easter-General has issued instructions that all local sources of supply are to be developed to the utmost. He reports that the prospects in this respect are promising in Mesopotemia in the Baghdad Valley, but that they are less go in Salonica. He is, however, communicating with his Overseas representatives again on the subject, and if may be advisable to send expert business men to these distant theatres to explore the question of local purchases.
SO^M ACOCIO^^IOH OB SHORS;I have dleeusgtd this .$ttettloa with ^ir Alfred teoghSir ff.Babtit.  . .As regards Salonika and Bgypt. th* poliey of derclqpinffHospital aeeoHafcc&amp;atica:ea ahore am already b*en adopted as xaras possible, and only tftrea military Hospital Ships are inuse.     The few cases that havp to bo evacuated from Salonikabaii-come to England by the friranto route when that is ready.In connection with the Mesopotamia Campaign^ thereare, however, no fewer than H Hospital ships. bulkof the evacuation is made to India whofre there ii adequateaoconanod?;tion, and I suggest that in order to save tonnage,a transfer of Hospital accommodation should, aa far aa possible,be made from India to Mesopotamia,     By this means tho numberof large vessels now employed as Hospital snips, would beteduced.V,     RBPUCTIOH m MSRQHAHT VBSSBIS ALLOCAUSE TQ TH3 flAVY.I had hoped that some reduction both in amount of, andrisk to, tonnage might have been effected hy the use of SouthAfrioon Goal carried by the Bed Sea route to the AsternMediterranean area of vWar.    I am assured, however, by tixejPtrst Sea Lord, that the South African Coal is not suitable forWar Ships.    Moreover, 90$ of the Colliers going from thiscountry to the Mediterranean bring back on their return voyageessential cargoes, such as Iron Ore from Spsln end otherMediterranean countries.Spnie saving in tonnage in the Mediterranean m^y bo madein the. following way.    There are at Saloniea a large number ofso-called Pleet Messengers:   these are small, fast Cross Channeland Irish Channel boats with a speed of about E0 knots.$hey have, keen used recently as a screen tux the big troop-ships, thus perforaing the work of destroyers.It is now proposed to use some of these small f?-st boatsfor tiie conveyance of troops between Taranto and S&apos;ilonlca, through$he Corinth Canal, thereby releasing the big troopshipe whichcould not in .%ny case have gone through the Canal.flhs First Sea Lord has also given instructions^or are-examination of 341 the colliers      -smaller vessels in the .service of. tho Admiralty   in the -Sast Mediterranean with a viewto reduction, and 1, hope to be dblo to report further on thismatter at a later date.3u1&amp;asy,It is imposeibis, &amp;t this stsge. to translate into anexact number of ships the total result of the saving obtainable.,but if the above proposals are carried into effect, theymust  yield very considerable economy in tonnage.
To-sum up,- my recommendati ohs; - are : -That *--tminspectors;;-&amp;frJiigh; -qual-i-f icat-ion.,should. .pe . sentto the-ports, used&apos; as- bases&apos; f or the Eastern&quot;Expeditions, 5 ;.who-should examine, the turn-round of vessels, :and report .direct to the Shipping^ controller.&apos;- A:third Inspector .should be sent from South .Africa&apos;to-East Africa.. -That the--policy of. usinr; troops-for&apos;-service in the theatreof&apos;-War nearest their homes, in order&quot; to save transport,&apos;.,should be pursued as far as possible-&apos;;&apos; using troops- from&apos;;Sou.th.&apos;Africav-Australia^ and *!ew;Ze-aland for Palestine &apos;     .and.
