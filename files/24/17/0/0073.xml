An important question has arisen as to whether public warnings of apprehended air-raids should be given in London during the day-time.The present system is that as soon as hostile aircraft are reportedapproaching any part of the South-eastern Coast, General Headquarters, HomeForces, issue a v/arning to Police, Fire Brigades and other authorities and toa limited number of factories in London and the South-eastern counties, butthere is in London no public warning by syren or hooter as in some provincialtowns.     Even if the hostile aeroplanes, which fly at 75 miles an hour, comedirect to London, about half-an-hour1s warning can usually be given.     But itmust happen that, in many cases, when the warning is given, the air-raid doesnot materialise at all, or other places than London are attacked.     Thus lastweek; while the warning on Wednesday was followed by an attack on London, asimilar warning on Thursday and two similar warnings en Friday when hostileaeroplanes were heard or seen on the Coast, were not followed by any attack.This matters comparatively little if the warning is only for the purpose ofpolice and fire brigade preparations, but it is a serious matter if on eachoccasion a public warning is issued and the whole life of London suspended ordisturbed.The advantages of public v/arning are:- (l) that it affords persons inthe street an opportunity to take refuge in houses or other places where theyare exposed to somewhat less risk than in the streets,   and (2) that many peopleare relieved from continuous anxiety if they can feel sure that they will alwayshave a warning before an attack.     Large employers of labour in particular feela responsibility towards their workpeople.The reasons against public warnings are:- (l) The increase of the death-roll likely to be caused by persons crowding into the street to watch   the attackby workpeople dispersing from factories, and by women rushing to the schools tofetch home their ohildren.     (This point was specially mentioned in the replygiven by i,lr. Bonar Law in the House of Commons en 14th Juno).     On the otherhand, a v/arning repeated on several occasions and not followed by attack islikely to be disregarded and to become useless for any purpose.     (2) The strongobjection which many people feel to the period of acute suspense which followsa warning.     (3) The disturbance of business, not only in the case of actualattack, but of all abortive warnings.     (4) Similar   disturbance of work infactories, particularly in munition factories.    Experience shews that in mostcases if factory workers are withdrawn from work on account of an apprehendedair-raid they will not resume work the same day.     (fi) The probability that oneof tho chief objects of the Germans in these air-raids is to cause dislocationof our business, transport, and manufacture: and that they will be encouragedto repeat the raids if they succeed in this.For
For these reasons, I am clearly of opinion that, if the only warning thatcan be given is one that must be given every time enemy aircraft oross orapproach the coast, there ought not to be any public warning by syren and hoot-er in London.This view would, however, be much modified if a second warning could begiven when it is fairly clear that London is the objective - say   when thehostile aircraft are twenty miles distant.     Five minutes after the hootersounds would be ample time to enable persons in the streets to take covor (andmove workpeople in   faotorio3 to the less exposed parts of the buildings).After receiving the Lord Mayor with a deputation from the London Mayors, Iurged Home Forces to consider whether this could bo done: but I hava receiveda reply in the negative of which a copy is annexed.     I am still not altogetherconvinced of the impossibility of giving in most cases a second warning whenthe airoraft are approaching London, or even of giving a general warning tothe whole of London when the guns at any point of the Outer Defenoes of London,begin to fire.    But if this is done it must clearly be done by GeneralHeadquarters, Home Forces: the suggestion in the last paragraph of LordFrenoh&apos;s letter that he should communicate information to the Home Officewould mean (l) additional delay and (2) duplication of expert staff and ofextensive telephone installations.I submit that either General Headquarters, Home Forces should be asked.by the Cabinet to make arrangements to give a second warning for what it maybe worth when hostile aircraft are actually near London: or that I should beauthorised to say that Hone Forces cannot give any later warning than whenhostile aircraft cross or approach the Coast, and that the objections to apublic warning - being given every time this happens are so strong that theproposal cannot be approved.GEORGE CAVE.23rd June, 1917.
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS.HOME FORCES,, 1018 (a,A.)HORSE GUARDS,LOiiDOH, S.W,22nci June, 1917,Sir,With referenoo to the deputation of the London Mayors received bythe Secretary of State yeeterday on the subjeot of the issue of publio warningsin London of day air raids and to the subsequent conversation Sir George Cavehad with Liout.-Colonel Llaud, General Staff, Home Foroes, I am direoted by theField Marshal Commanding-in-Ghief, Home Foroes, to say that it is understoodthat it is desired that, in addition to the Order &quot;Take Air Raid Action&quot; whiohwill be communicated whenever possible to all on the Day Warning List aB soonas the enemy are first seen approaching or over our coast, a second warning shallbo given when the attaok appears to be developing on London in order that a publicwarning may be issued.2.     I am to point out that, with enemy machines flying at a great altitude, thereis no certainty of observation nor can the objective be predicted, and if allprearranged stops are not taken when the enemy are first observed approaching orover the coast of England, and further information is relied upon before takingsuch steps, then considerable risk is incurred, as there may be either nosubsequent observations of the enemy, or such observations may not be made untilhe is near or over London, when it would be too late for the local authoritiesto take the aotion considered necessary.3.    I am further to say that calculated on the basis of the speed of themachines the aneny have recently used (i.e. approximately 75 miles per hour),any secfend warning tc London, if issued in time to enable aotion to be taken,would have to be based on observations of the enemy from approximately a lineNorth and South through. Southend.     Very little advantage would, therefore, begained should the attack be made on the most probable line, i.e, the East EssexCoast South of the Blackwater and the Thames Estuary.4.     There is, moreover, nothing to prevent the enemy employing in the futurefaster and more powerful maohines for raiding this country, in whioh case theOrder &quot;T.A.R.A.&quot;, issued on information being received that the enemy areBightod off the coast, would reach the local authorities in London none too soonto enable a publio 7farning, should it be decided to issue such,, to be gi,ven inP.     In those circumstances the Field Marshal considers that it is not praotioablsto issue a seoond warning to London as suggested, but he will, should the HoneSecretary so desire, communicate to him all reports of the movements of theenemy that are received at G.H.Q., Home Foroes, in order that he may take anyaction that he  considers necessary.time.I am, Sir,Under Secretary of State,HOME -OFFICE ,*Your obedient Servant,(Signed) F.C SHAW.Major General.General Staff, Home Forces.
