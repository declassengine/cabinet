Operations *Prom :-   General Van Deventer, Dar-es-Salaam.To CI.G.S,21st June, 1917.Handed in 4,10 p.m,a.992,Reference ray 0.980, 20th June.The results of my interview with BelgianCommander-in-Chief were as follows :*-A. We agreed that force engaged in Naumann operationsis too large and that smaller could &quot;be given more mobilityand also that mixed force of British and Belgians moredifficult to work than a homogeneous one.   W.e there-fore decided that Belgians take over Naumann operationsfrom June 25th.    I assist with motor cars, steamer transporton Victoria Nyanza and supplies and in variety of other ways.This will allow withdrawal of 4th Nigeria Regiment, l/6thKing&apos;s African Rifles, 30th Punjabis and Cape (? groupomitted) to general reserve.   However,- should Naumann breaktowards British East Africa or Arusha I shall, of course,co-operate on that&apos; side.B. A Belgian Column of 500 rifles with auxiliarytroops is being at once sent from Dodoma via Iringa RungembaG.E.D.L.7 D. to Makuas G.F.D.D.7 A. whence it will operateon the Malinje (?Malingano) Mpepo front.    This willprobably allow of l/lst King&apos;s African Rifles being with-drawn from TJbena to Songea.C. A Belgian Column of 1,200 rifles and Auxiliarytroops will be got ready during July, which will be composedof 1st Regiment.   This will in all probability act fromKllosa and Kidodi towards Maheiige..   D.
D. Eventually Belgians will take over the Mahengeoperations entirely,     This is completely in accordancewith Colonel Huyghers own wish.E, The Conference was marked throughout &quot;byutmost cordiality and mutual desire to co-operate, andI shall assist Belgians to the utmost of my power withsupplies, transport, etc.
