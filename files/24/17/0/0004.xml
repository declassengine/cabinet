A lengthy Report has he en prepared on imports andindustry in relation to shipping, which shows the positionat the end of May.   The outstanding points seem to be:-The reduction in tons of goods imported as compared withthe corresponding periods of 1916 and 1913 was much smallerin May than in either of the two preceding months.    Asagainst May 1916 it was 649,000 tons or 18$.    The corres-ponding difference for April was 850,000 tons and for March1,073,000 tons.In the latest Eeport by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr.  ldertonit is estimated that the shortage of shipping will matenecessary an aggregate reduction of imports in 1917, asagainst 1916 of some 11^ million tons or 27/b.    The claimsmade to the Shipping Priority Committee for tonnage foreach of the months June, July and August exceed the esti-mates of possible imports by 500,000 tons for June and550,000 tons each for July and August.In May the imports of goods placed upon the restricted listin February were down by 389,000 tons or 6($ as against May1916 and by 74 per cent as against 1913, while other re-strieted goods were down by 54,000 tons or 33 per cent on1916 and by the 71 per cent on 1913..   On the other hand, theimport of unrestricted imports (excluding Munitions) in Maywas reduced by no more than 206,000 tons or 7 per cent ascompared with 1916 and by 12 per cent as compared with 1913.The restrictions that have been introduced thus appear to behaving the desired effect in concentrating the necessaryreduction upon less essential imports.     The savings onrestricted goods as a whole remain as in previous monthsmuch in excess of what was anticipated.   This is chiefly
due to the vary large saving on timber.(4)  Among unrestricted goods it is satisfactory to note thatthe i;?rports of Grain and Flour in lay 1917 were about100,000 tons above those for May 1916, in which monththey were equal to the imports of May 1913.    The importsof meat on the other hand were down 27% on May 1916, andmade a less satisfactory showing than in any earliermonth of the year.(5)   Changes in re-exports do not make the percentage changesof net imports and of gross imports substantiallydifferent.    Nevertheless it is satisfactory to note- thatin May re-exports in general, and especially re-exportsof food and raw cotton, had fallen to a very smallpercentage of last year!s level.(6)  A review of the position of certain of the more importantBritish industries which might appear prima facie to bethreatened &quot;by recent events does not suggest that anyimmediate unexpected danger need be feared. The onlyexception to this is with regard to mineral oils broughtin tankers.    There have recently been heavy losses ofthese vessels and the stock of kerosene and motor spiritis low.    If, it is decided to cut do?.n still furtherthe imports of raw cotton or lubricating oils, the posi-tion will, become very difficult.(7)   As against 1913 the reduction in tonnage of goods importedhas been throughout this yetr much less than the reductionof tonnage entrances (with cargo).    The comparison with1916 does not work out so well, but in May there was anotable improvement, there being only 18% contraction ofimports (other than munitions) in that month against acontraction of 24$ in entrances.
In May the entrances of British vessels were 1,613,000tons (i.e. 8. less than in May 1916) and the entrances offoreign vessels 397,000 tons, (i.e. 56$ less).    BothBritish and foreign entrances were larger in May than theyhad been in April.    British clearances were 1,266,000 tons(i.e. 20/  less than in May 1916) and foreign clearances865,000 tons (i.e. 51$ less than they were in May 1916),Jar and away the larger part (&quot;between 70$ and 80$) of theaggregate reduction in entrances and clearances as comparedwith May 1916 was due to foreign vessels.    Among theseforeign vessels, theentrances of Allies (other than theUnited States) m May 1917 were actually larger than inMay 1916.    Entrances cf United States vessels hadincreased in April compared with April 1916, by no less than80$:    but in May, as compared with May 1916, they decreasedby 47$.    The decrease in neutral entrances in May was66$ approximately the same as in April.The contraction in entrances and clearances has not beenequal on the different principal trade routes.    In theReport a table is given distinguishing these routes indetail.    The entrances of British vessels have duringthe year: been abnormally high from Australia and have beenfairly well maintained along the Atlantic routes.   Inview of certain modifications in the routes followed and.of other changes it is reasonable to expect during thecurrent year some economy in the use of ships, so thatthe proportion of entrances to quantity of shipping-available will be increased.   In April and May therewere distinct signs of improvement in this direction.
(ll) On the 30th of April the gross tonnage of British steamvessels -ever 1600 tons (including oilers and prises) notin the service of the Army or Navy or otherwise unavailableof which use can he made for the ordinary trade of theUnited Kingdom amountod to a little over seven milliontons, end there were available something under half amillion tons of vessels between 500 and 1,600 tons,.   Thewhole steam fleet of the British Empire exceeding&apos; 500tons mobilisable for all purposes amounted (includingprises to about 17,000,000 tons:   and-that of all theAllied Nations together to between 26 and 27 million tons.(12) During the first five months of 1917 about 1,700,000 tonsof our shipping of over 1,600 tons (excluding oilers and&quot;prises.) were destroyed (over 1,550,000 by war risk).;   andover 600,000 tons of new and acquired shipping was madeavailable, leaving a net loss of well over a million tons^During the same period the losses of Allies amounted to465,000 tons and of neutrals to 737., 000 tons.; -making anaggregate :gross destruction of the -world1 s tonnage of noless than 2* 900,000 tons.    In. May -the British losses ofvessels over 1,,600 tens wore 347,000 tons as compared with502,000 tons in April and -358.,000 &quot;in March:   and the re-placement was 167,000 tons as compared with 115,000 tons-in April and 170,000 in March..(-13) It is thus evident that, despite the failure of the enemysubmarines to   maintain the high rate of sinking that wasreached in the-last fortnight of April, the situation-isstill exceedingly serious../If-the average rate -that ruledover the first five months is maintained throughout the
year the aggregate losses by enemy action of British vesselswill amount for 1917 to 4 million tons, which is more thanhalf of the tonnage now available for the general trade ofthe United Kingdom,   On the same hypothesis the aggregatedestruction of the world&apos;s tonnage will amount for the yearto about 7 million tons.   In view of these facts,   SirAlfred Watson and Mr. Slderton urge that arrangementsshould be made forthwith for completing, either in the.United Kingdom or in America, 4 million tons gross registerof new vessels during the next IB months.Board of Trade,13th June, 1917.
