B*ilP/006.Weekly Report on Poland.   VI*(2J3*d June, 1917.)Practically no news is to hand ah out current events in Polandbut from earlier information it is possible to deduce the mainline of political developments.(1)    Political Recoupments.    The confusion which prevailsin internal Polish politics is largely due to the fact that thereare two conflicting principles in the political divisions: socialConservatism no longer invariably coincides with the traditionalConservative policy with regard to national politics.     It is onlyby keeping in view the fundamental lines of development that itis possible to unravel to some extent the present tangle ofPolish politics.For the last 100 years the Conservative elements in Polandhave been opposed    to. &quot;maximalist&quot; or revolutionary tactics Withregard to the partitioning Powers; having much at stake theydisliked a policy of adventure and preferred to gain some measureof power and freedom by a show of loyalty to their rulers (moreoverthey naturally disliked revolution of any kind).     The ultimatelogical result of their policy was expressed in the doctrine ofa &quot;triple loyalty&quot;, i.e., that the Poles should not aim at followingout one national policy but should in each part of the country makea separate peace with their masters.     Meantime the Radicalspreached revolution, national as well as social.Triple loyalty could not, however, serve as a Polish battle-cry in a war between the partitioning Powers, and each side con-sequently developed an &quot;ideology&quot; professing hopes against hope
- 2 -land believing the unbelievable (cf. Maciiiavelli&apos;s remarks on theh importance   e-f propoaal-s of possessing material power so as to beBable to compel faith after it is gone).     A split followed in theBpolish Conservative camp and however v/ell some of the leaders of theBtwo opposing groups were mutually re-insured, in the public arenaBthere were two sharply opposed policies and a considerable amountI of bitterness was developed in the party strife.     The bulk of theConservative elements of Russian Poland declared complete nationalreunion to be the first and paramount national consideration, theConservative elements of Austrian Poland put the main emphasis onUthe necessity of attaining independent Polish Statehood even ifwithin narrower frontiers.    Thus either group declared in favourof that which was offered by their own government, i.e., that whichthey could aim at without &quot;disloyalty&quot;.The Radicals who were not divided by any &quot;triple loyalties&quot;at first joined the Cracow aristocratic group on an anti-Russianplatform, without however ever becoming pro-Austriiuis themselves.They were not led by devotion to the Habsburgs but by hostilityto the Russian autocracy.     For the first 2% years it was thepro-Austrian group which consequently made revolutionary politicsin Russian Poland.     Now the political position has been completelytransformed by the Russian revolution.     On Polish grounds hardlyany one can continue to profess an&quot;anti-Russian front&quot;.     TheCentral Powers hold all three parts of Poland and Russia hasrenounced all her claims to the country.     It is from the CentralPowers that the independence and reunion of Poland have to beextracted.     And again the traditional Conservative tactics advise&quot;loyalty and conciliation&quot; as the best and safest method, whilstthe Radicals take to desperate aggressive tactics and political^aximalism.     Had the pro-Austrian Conservatives succeeded inobtaining real self-government and independence for Poland even
within narrower frontiers their policy might have prevailed;     Buttheir failure is &quot;becoming mOre obvious eVOry da^ and the Radicalsno longer see any reason for imposing moderation upon themselves -they may as v/ell ask for the whole hog.     Polish independenceswhich is nor- acknowledged by Russia an-0 her Allies is no longera pro^Austrian platformj on the contrary even this cry now turnsagainst the Central Pov/ers; for it is they who withhold self-government from Poland.    $he Radicals having broken off theiralliance with the pr6*Austrian Conservatives, have joined thedemand for complete reunion to the cry for independence.     Theissue now before the late pro-Russian Conservatives in RussianPoland is whether they are to join the pro-Austrians on a commonConservative platform or to plunge together with the Radicals intoa revolutionary raaximalism.The conflict of the conciliatory and ,maximalistl policiesruns at present like a red thread through the whole of Polishpolitics.     The public declaration of the representatives of Galiciain favour of a united rad independent Poland (Cracow, May 29), thechange in the leadership of the Polish Parliamentary Club in Vienna,the passing of the Poles into opposition in the Vienna Parliament,the consequent crisis in the Austrian Cabinet - these are the firsteffects of the new Radical orientation.     But the moderates havenot given up the game for lost; it would therefore be too much torely on the future consistency even in the policy of the Poles inVienna.    There are wobblers in the Club who nay turn again andagain.     For the moment, however, the moderates seem to transferthe centre of their activity to&apos;Russian Poland, but so far withoutany visible success.     They tried (unsuccessfully) at an informalmeeting of members of the Council of State at Warsaw to carrythrough a formal acknowledgment of the Craatow resolution, butreasserting that the Act of November 5 remains for them the basis
m    A    mJ - &quot;political action.The driving force behind Polish radicalsim is now thearvation of the masses.     Galieia and Poland have been strippedmost of their supplies by the Central Pov/ers - this is obviousevery workman and every peasant.    The,? Imow that only one thingi *3*ew save them from a catastrophe, namely, that an end shouldmade^to the rule of the foreigners.(2)    The Germanb and the Polish Army.   No doubt owing to thetion of the Polish Radicals and their growing influence the Germansem to have openly turned against the idea of forming a Polishmy.    Po2rifcowing on a long series of recent measures which seemedeliberately calculated to deter the Poles from joining that armyerman officers were put in command of the training camps, attemptsere made to introduce &amp; German language, uniforms of a German cutere handed out, etc.) General von Beseler has now practicallycrapped the recruiting organisation in Russian Poland.     Only thecentral recruiting offices remain in existence, the 73 districtmiches and 400 local offices have been closed b^ an order datedne 4.    Volunteers are told to apply to the German Kreischefs -e former recruiting offices were all run by Polish Legionaries,e Radicals^treat this measure with complete indifference, theo-Austrian moderates are alarmed.(3)   Lithuania.     A suspicious amount of activity is displayedith regard to Lithuania.     On May 22 all the Polish parties atarsaw declared in favour of independence for Lithuania which theyish to see united to Poland.     On May 30 a council of Lithuanianotables was formed at Vilna by the German Supreme Command.   . Theotorious German government agent, Baron von der Ropp, is concernedthis new intrigue.     He is by extraction a Baltic German, hiscle, the Bishop of Vilna, considers himself a Pole, and he him-lf professes to be a Lithuanian.     This is the same man who got
up last winter the appeal of Hthe oppressed nationalities of Russia11to President Wilson.     So far it is impossible to fix even theoutlines of the new Lithuanian intrigue.LBN.
