June 1917. .cCONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM.Dwic/i Exports of Agricultural Produce to the United Kingdom and to Germany.UNDER existing agreements with the Dutch we are entitled to a certain share ofDutch agricultural produce, of which a considerable proportion is thus prevented fromreaching Germany, who otherwise would receive almost the whole of the exportableamount. The share offered to us (including Belgian relief) of the ^ different kinds ofproduce varies frxpm 25 to 75 per cent., and in the case of margarine to about 90 percent. We are unfortunately dependent upon Dutch supjDhe^pf^ margarine. ^ Theother commodities which we import largely from TCIIanQ are condensed&quot;&apos;mllir(75 percent.)., flax-seed (67 per cent.), meat (50 per cent.), butter, cheese,, eggs, fish,vegetables, &amp;c.2. Since the commencement of the intensive submarine campaign the Dutchships in the British trade have suspended sailings, and our imports from Holland areCarried almost exclusively in British vessels. Owing to the insufficient number ofnaval convoys to the delay in loading caused by the uncertainty of the date of convoy,and the consequent irregularity of sailings, the foodstuffs which we might obtain fromHolland are not shipped to their full amount, and the Dutch prefer to send as much aspossible of our share to Belgium rather than to the United Kingdom.3. The round voyage of the British vessels in question is said.to take about twenty-1one days, and there is now rarely a convoy more than once in.eight days, although the IAdmiralty at one time had agreed to arrange for convoys every four days.    TheAdmiralty are understood to be strongly averse from increasing the number of convoys,and moreover are insisting that any vessel to be convoyed must be capable of 11 knotsan hour.   In these circumstances the Ministry of Shipping are, it seems, contemplating Ithe withdrawal of all British vessels from the trade with Holland. &apos;4. The result of such a measure would be that we should practically cease to getany foodstuffs from Holland or Other articles which we require (such as glycerine,flax, &amp;c), as Dutch vessels refuse to sail without a convoy. This is a contingency,which, in view of the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements, particularly of margarine,merits very careful consideration. In regard to this aspect of the situation twoletters from Lord Emmott and the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department areannexed, showing respectively the position as regards margarine and other foodstuffscovered by our agreements and dealing with the present difficulties and delays ofshipping. v5. There is another aspect which also claims serious attention from a general,political, and military point of view. The further result of- a cessation of Dutchexports to .the United Kingdom would undoubtedly be that the whole of the Dutchexportable produce&quot; would go to our enemies.6. At the present stage of the war it is, of course, of the greatest importance toprevent any such contingency, and, if we cannot altogether stop such exports toGermany, at least to limit them to the lowest possible figure. With this object andparticularly in view of the imminent export of 250,000 head of cattle from Holland,which we are informed is likely to take place in consequence of the severe draughtand expected shortage of the Dutch hay harvest we have already urged the UnitedStates Government to take drastic measures in respect of American exports to Holland  :that is to say, to make any exports conditionalon a cessation, or, at least, a very great lreduction, of Dutch exports to Germany, Such supplies as Germany obtains from jneutral countries are, to a very large extent, drawn from Holland&apos;s native produce. [\ erv effective pressure can undoubtedly be exercised upon the Dutch by the with-holding of the American exports of grain and feeding-stuffs, and Holland is not self-supporting in these articles.[no]
7. In the event, however, of the United States not being prepared to take thisaction, or in the event of its not having the desired effect upon Dutch exports toGermany, we should have to deal with a grave contingency-one that could only be11met by an action on our part which would practicallv amount to enforcing a blockade jof Holland. - - jForeign Office, June 18, 1917.Annex 1.War Trade Department,4, Central Buildings, Westminster, S.W.1,Dear Leverton Harris, June 14, 1917.MR. AMERY, the representative of this Department on the&apos;Bunker Committee,informs me that considerable difficulty is now being experienced in connection with,the, convoy of British vessels to and from Holland.   The round voyage is said to taketwenty-one days at present, and the Shipping Controller has written to the Admiraltyto state that he considers this period is excessive, and that foodstuffs from Holland are \bought too dearly if it means tying up at least twenty British vessels which only make!one round voyage to Holland every twenty-one days.   It is further alleged that owing *to delays due to the convoy some of the cargoes of foodstuffs arrive in this country ina bad condition. , : -A few days ago a representative of Price, Waterhouse, and Co., who examinesVan den Bergh&apos;s books in Holland, informed Sir Alexander King that Van den Bergh&apos;sare now normally: producing only.about 180 tons per week of margarine for thiscountry instead of the 1,000 or 1,200 tons per week which they were making a fewmonths ago. The reason for the diminution is the same shipping difficulty which Ihave described above.EriceiiiWaterhouse, representative told Sir Alexander King a rather interesting,story about a recent voyage. Ships were being loaded for this country, and Van den ,Bergh&apos;s therefore put on a spurt, and, by working, day and night, got out 800 tons of jmargarine that week-end with a view to shipping it. 600 tons were actually on boardwhen an order came that the ships were to be closed and to be ready for sea in four Ihours. The order came, 1 think, on Monday, but the convoy did not sail until the IWednesday week.The imports of margarine into the United Kingdom from Holland for May wereonly 4,500 tons. This figure compares with over 16,000 tons in December last, and anaverage of nearly J2,000 tons per.month for the year 1916. The result is that thereare already long,queues at the margarine shops.I have made some enquiry about shipping difficulties from a high official in theShipping Control Department, and he informs me that if the system of convoy for,ships coming from Holland is discontinued it does not follow that the traffic will cease. IBut obviously an efficiently conducted convoy system ought to be for the benefit o  the Itrade ; the present system appears capable of much improvement.In the circumstances stated it may interest you and Lord Robert to be informed ofthe latent returns in our possession of&apos; the stocks of oleaginous material in the handsof Messrs. Jurgens and Van den Bergh. In May last Jurgens had over 9,400 tons ofoil values of raw materials, which would be capable of producing about 11,00.0 tons cfmargarine. At the same time Van den Bergh&apos;s had in stock slightly over 8,000 tonsof oil values of raw material, which would produce about 9,500 tons of margarine. Asthese figures for the two firms only represent roughly about two. months&apos; manufactureat full pressure, the stocks are smaller than usual.Yours sincerely,The Right Honourable &apos; EMMOTT.,   F. Leverton Harris, M.P.,,        Foreign Office, ; ;Downing Street, S.W. 1.
Annex 2.Restriction of Enemy Suppties Department,6, Waterloo Places S.W.,QlT) June 16, 1917.I AM directed to refer to your communication No. 109990/X of 12th June, trans-mitting despatch from Sir W. Townley and memoranda from Mr. Maxse on the subjectof convoys from Holland.I am to say that the Department entirely concur in the views expressed byMr. Maxse as to the desirability of bi-weekly convoys during the next few months.I am to point out that a large portion of the produce shipped under theAgricultural Agreement is of a highly perishable nature, and in this connection I amto refer especially to the exports of butter, potatoes, fruit, and vegetables, and to theimminent export of meat. It will also be noted that similar considerations apply tomargarine, of which commodity the Department understand there is at present anacute shortage in the United Kingdom.The following list of convoys provided since 1st January, 1917, is submitted : January 3, 15, 22, 25, February 3, 7, 23, 28, March 6,14, 20, 31, April 5, 9,15, 24,May 3, 8, 18, 30, June 8, 14.It will be noted that since 1st March there have been to date fourteen convoys, oran average of about one convoy in eight days, but that the intervals between theconvoys are becoming increasingly irregular.I am to observe that the inadequacy of the service of convoys has been causingespecial difficulty in the working of the Dutch Trawler Agreement, which has beenrendered more acute by the warm weather.For naval reasons the Admiralty find it necessary to instruct the Departmentsfish carriers to load their fish cargoes immediately on their arrival in Holland, and toproceed to the Hook to await convoy, and in response to enquiries from the Depart-ment the Lords Commissioners have intimated that in the interests of secrecy it isimpossible to vary this arrangement by giving short notice to the Departments agentsof the date of sailing of the convoy.The combined effect of this arrangement with the irregular convoys is illustratedby the last voyage of the Departments fish carrier, steamship &quot; Magrix.&quot; This vesselarrived in Holland on the 20th May, completed loading a cargo of 3,003 cases onthe 22nd May, and proceeded to the Hook to await convoy. The convoy did not sailuntil the 30th May, and on arrival in Billingsgate 2,040 cases of fish were condemnedforthwith.As Lord Robert Cecil is aware, the Dutch trawl fishing has fortunately been muchrestricted lately, owing to disputes between the Dutch and the Germans. None the lessthe losses sustained by this Department from condemnations have, since the 14th. April,amounted to 7,0001. The dispute is now, practically settled, and it is anticipated thatthe full fishing will re-commence next week.The Department therefore venture to impress upon Lord Robert Cecil the extremeurgency of the question, and the vital importance in the interests of the&quot; food supply oflargely augmenting the number of convoys at the earliest possible date.I am, &amp;c.(For the Secretary),T. E. PRYCEvTANNATT.
