From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 2bth June 1917.(Repeated.to Teheran.)  -(Received at India Office, 11 p.m.)730 S. Secret. Persia. Teheran&apos;s telegram 21,2 F., dated 21st June,further confirms view put forward in our telegram of 18th June. We viewwith gravest concern prospect of anarchy in Persia or of democratic Govern-ment definitely-hostile to us, especially as present wave of democratic feelingappears infinitely more genuine and widespread than any before. Results ofanarchy or a democratic government hostile to our interests would involve (a) disintegration of South Persia Rifles on which our military position inSouth Persia depends ; (6) our evacuation of Sbiraz at least; (c) specialmeasures to secure Gulf ports; (d) an open road for Turks to Herat withprobable spread of war to Afghanistan and Indian frontier; (e) hostilemenace to oil-fields and Arabistan via Laristan, thus threatening Maude&apos;sbase and communications.To obviate consequences so serious from both military and politicalstandpoint, we think that every endeavour should be made to conciliate, defacto, democratic leaders, including financial assistance, and if this bepossible money should not be spared. To this end we should not hesitate toscrap 1907 Convention or to reconsider August agreement. As regardsSouth Persia Rifles, we should be prepared to discuss greater measure ofPersian control in the future subject to retention of British officers so longas we pay- -but not barring neutral officers if Persia assumes responsibilityof payment after the war. As regards joint financial control, we think thatwe should not press this matter too strongly. Would it be out of thequestion to bring back Schuster who is certainly persona grata withdemocratic party ?It is obvious that any attempt to continue old reactionary policy isdoomed to failure in Persia and can only discredit us deeply elsewhere.A Turkish advance on Teheran may be imminent, and we notice fromDirector of Military Intelligence^ 36587 cipher, 22nd June, that Salar edDawleh appears to be with the Turks watching his opportunity. The bestdeterrent is belief that Persia and Persian Government are solidly on ourside, and the best proof of this will be their continued support of our-efforts,to improve South Persia Rifles. In the meantime we are considering whatpolitical, military and commercial measures will be necessary in the event ofPersia declaring against us.No trace of a telegram from Teheran of this date;? intended to refer to Sir C. Marling&apos;s telegram.of 17th June, 1917,
