Section A.D^BARWM OF INF0RHATI01JIflTELDIGEBCE BUREAU.THE   HOFFMAM - GRB5H   AFFAIR.Dr. Arthur Hoffmann, who has just resigned hismembership of the Swiss Federal Council and the conduct of thePolitical Department (Foreign Affairs) has long been a promi-nent figure in Swiss political life.    He is exactly 60 yearsof age, and, when the Grimm affair was disclosed, the German-Swiss newspapers were calling attention to his 60th birthdayand offering him congratulations.     He received his legal edu-cation at the Universities of Leipzig and Strassburg and prac-tised as a lawyer at St. Gall, where he was for 25 years amember of the Grand Council and three times its president.For 15 years he was a member of the Swiss St&amp;nderat (UpperHouse of the Swiss Parliament, representative of the Cantons)and subsequently became a member of the Federal Council (theSwiss Government with, seven members), first of all as Headof the Department of Justice and Police, and afterwards asHead of the Military Department.     In 1914 he was President ofthe Swiss Confederation (an office held for one year and carry-ing little or none of the prestige which attaches to the presi-dencies of other Republics) and at the same time he took over-    ;.&apos; ::: &apos;  r &apos; SI    &quot;  if &apos;    &apos;the charge of the Political Department (Foreign Affairs) whichhe continued to hold until his resignation the other day..Although a German-Swiss, he was &quot;hitherto supposed to be fairlyimpartial in his management of foreign affairs.The great majority of the Swiss are German-speaking.Apart from the Italian-speaking Ticino and the Grisons, where14$ of the population speak Italian and ZBfo Romansch, there areonly five cantons out of twenty-two where over -60$ of the popu-
lation speak French.     There are, I think, two French-speakingmembers of the Federal Council.     It is proposed to increasethe number of members, so as to have a larger French-speakingrepresentation.Since the outbreak of war there have been frequentmanifestations of sympathy with the German cause, among largesections of the German-Swiss.     The German-Swiss press has,in many cases, encouraged and reflected those sympathies.Indeed there are several journals, like the Berner Tagj&amp;blatt ,which are practically Imperial German organs.     The German-speaking officers of the Swiss Army, a good number of whomreceived their military education in Prussia and other Germanstates, made no concealment of their German sympathies.     Someof them went further and, like Colonels Egl^and Wattenwyl, for-merly of the Swiss General Staff, actively favoured the enemy.The trial of Egli and Wattenwyl in the spring of 1916 broughthadout the fact that these two officers/regulcrly communicated tothe German and Austrian Military Attaches the confidentialSwiss Staff Heports on the military affairs of the Allies.No civil punishment was inflicted upon the two colonels, butthey were dealt with by military discipline and removed fromtheir staff appointments.    Egli is now the military critic ofthe Basler Nachrichten, in which he writes with marked hostilityto the Allies.There was quite a crop of minor military incidents -mostly oases of tactless public utterances - by German-speakingSwiss officers.     These and the &quot;affair of the two Colonels&quot;excited bitterness and deep dissatisfaction in the FrencK-speaking Cantons.     This feeling was manifested with character-istio restraint in Geneva (till the other day), but at Lausanneand in the Canton of leufchatel, there were repeatedly violentAemsnstrations.     The dissatisfaction of the French-Swiss was
intensified by what they regarded as the &quot;Prussification&quot; ofthe Army in matters of discipline, drill, etiquette, and, aboveall, the treatment of the common soldier by imitators of thePrussians among the Swiss officers.     All such proceedings wereparticularly repugnant to Swiss democratic ways.At the beginning of the War, the parliamentaryrepresentatives of the nation (the Ifationalrat) and of theCantons fStanderat) placed what were practically autocraticpowers in the Iknds of the Federal Council, and the federalCouncil itBelf conf6rice&amp; very wide powers upon the supremecommand of the Army (General Wills and his staff).     The ArmyCommand became in fact independent of the Civil authorities.Owing to the peculiar position of Switzerland, in the midst offour of the chief belligerents, this delegation of powers wasat first patiently borne as an emergency measure.    But, asabuses began to be suspected and as &quot;incidents&quot; multiplied,there was widespread disquietude both as regards the. action ofthe Federal Council and (still more) as regards the attitude andconduct of the Army authorities.    The German-Swiss differ fromthe French-Swiss in their conceptions of liberty, to which bothpopulations are ardently devoted.    The German-Swiss are moreinclined to aim at securing both national and individual libertyby entrusting power to the constituted authorities.    ThoFrench-Swiss, still under the influence of the traditions ofthe French Revolution, believe in the necessity of constantcriticism and steady popular control over any authority whichthe nation may appoint in order to secure the execution of itswill.     Once a central authority has been set up, the Gorman-Swiss are inclined to give it free play and to regard it as thebest bulwark of national security.    The French-Swiss prefer towatch a strong central authority very jealously, and they alwaysregard it as a potential danger to individual liberty and, in
the present situation, to national independence.     The Hoffmannaffair has confirmed the French-Swiss in their view, and theindignation at the disregard of French-S?/iss warnings is soviolent that even in law-abiding Geneva, there have been riotsand attacks upon the German, Austro-Hungarian and (Turkish Con-sulates.The semi-official statement issued at Berne on June18 will not appease feeling in the non-German Oantons.     Thestatement says that Hoffmann&apos;s message to Grimm was despatched,&quot;without any influence having been exerted upon him, in theinterest of the promotion of an early peace and, therefore, inthe interest of his own country.&quot;The object of the words I have underlined is tocall fresh attention to the hardships and anxieties of Switzer-land arising out of the war, in consequence of the restrictionsimposed by Germany and by the Western belligerents upon Swissimports and exports.     The expense and hardship of keeping theSwiss Army mobilised are also very serious.But the French-Swiss know very well that a largesection of German-Swiss opinion, including probably that ofthe German-speaking members of the Pederal Council, is favour-able to an early peace in the interest of Germany as well asin that of Switzerland.     The German-Swiss motives are bothcultural and economic.     Many German-Swiss would feel that ifGermany were thoroughly defeated and humiliated, their ownposition in the Swiss Confederation would suffer serious eclipse.The French and Italian-Swiss would be able to reproach them withtheir former sympathies and to repel their frequent assumptionof cultural superiority on the ground of their share in GermanKultur.     Economically German-Switzerland and the German Empireare connected by a thousand ties, financial, industrial and
- coMneroi-aX.., ^-Gorman-Swiss industry is dependent upon Germanyfor coal and iron and, even now, to some extent for food fpota-toes).     Per contra Swiss cattle and also milk-products srelargely exported to Germany.     TLe irench-Swiss, or, at anyrate, their Press^ had come to admit the necessity of specialWar Agreements with Germany in the commercial sphere and werehacking German-Swiss opinion in protests against the Allies1criticisms of these Agreements      They nowifeel that they have&quot;been &quot;let in&apos;1 by Hoffmann!s conduct and that the worst suspi-cions of the Allies have been confirmed.    Not only have theirown pro-Ally sentiments been outraged;   they will also have tobear their share of any untoward economic consequences whichmay ensue.    And the Allies have shrewd suspicions that in theeconomic sphere there have been as serious departures fromneutrality as Hoffmann1s politioal aberration.     Schmidtbeina,a leading Swiss politician and one of the delegates to theParis negotiations with the Allies, is suspected of having,inhis private capacity as a business-man, (he is a big industrial-ist) favoured breaches of the regulations for preventing certaiiiexports to Ger..iany.THE MuTSHIiEMAM CASE.And now - fatal in their inopportuneness from theSwiss point of view - have come the verdict and the sentencesin the Mtlhlemann case.   Mllhlemann, an official of the CentralGovernment, had accepted bribes to the tune of no less than 9,000 (225,000 fr.), also jewels, from persons named Kohlrausch,Moser, Aufrichtig and Dauer, in exchange for permits to buy uplarge quantities of provisions (aoeaparement),    This and pre-vious cases of aooaparement have always been treated in theGerman-Swiss press as a proceeding prejudicial to the interestsof the Swiss people, because intended to raise unduly the priceof food-stuffs in Switzerland - in the interests of nrofiteers -
But MtLbJemarm also, it seems, obtained export-permits for hisclients;   and Dauer, one of the accused, was a German and hasfled to Germany and forfeited his bail of 50,000 francs.   Thereis good reason to believe that many of the accapareurs, fromfirst to last, were acting on behalf of Germany.     Large stockswere accumulated which only the vigilance of the S.S.S.(Societede Surveillance Suisse, established at the instance of theAllies), prevented from leaving the country for German destina-tions.     Mtthlemann has been sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment,a fine of 5,000 francs, and loss of civil rights (vote etc.) forthree years.     Dauer, who fled, has been sentenced to four monthsimprisonment and a fine of 10,000 francs.     Kohlrausch, Moserand Aufrichtig, were acquitted,,although it is mentioned in thesentence that &quot;the jewels presented to Muhlemann by Moser are tobe confiscated&quot;.     The State likewise confiscates the 225,000 frs.of bribes which Mflhlemann received.     The sentences seem to beremarkably light.The German-Swiss Press laments the dreadful exposure,pleads that Mflhlemann was only a temporary (war-time) official,and says that the reputation of Swiss officialdom for incorrupti-bility has stood unassailably high, there having been no case ofcorruption since 1848.     What must be very keenly felt ia thatthe Hoffmann and Muhlemann cases, coming to a head simultane^ous-ly, will make the Allies watch still more closely the doings ofthe Sv/iss C;-overnment and its officials.G R I M M.Grimm is the Sv/iss Socialist leader of the anti-mili-tarist grou-;.* in the popular representative Chamber (Nationalrat).It is a small group, consisting of some six or seven Social Demo-crats, but, through Grimm, it has control of the Berner Tagwacbt,the leading Socialist paper in Berne.     Some weeks ago Grimmintroduced a motion (which was not carried) to congratulate the
the Russians on their Revolution.    He delivered a speech ofover an hour&apos;s duration in support of his motion.     He haddoubtless his jour.xy to Russia in view, and wanted to recommendhimself to the Russian Revolutionaries.     The German Governmentallowed him free passage through Germany oh his way to Russiavia Stockholm.It is to he noted that Grimm is a German &quot;by birth,but is naturalised in Switzerland.     He was an active promoter,and the  resident of the Zimmerwald pacifist conferences,attended by a few French Socialists.     How far he has- beenacting on direct German instigation, or, like Hoffmann, haslent himself to German attempts to detach Russia from theAllies, remains to be seen.     The attacks of Grimm1s organ,the Berner Tagwaoht, upon Swiss Militarism1 have been of avery extravagant character.     I was repeatedly told in Switzer-land that, while there was certainly a substratum of fact inhis accusations regarding maltreatment-of soldiers, etc., hewas guilty of the grossest exaggerations, and sometimesdealt in pure inventions.     The Chaux-de-Fonds disturbances(about which I recently wrote) were grist to the mill of theBerner Tagwacht.The Hoffmann-Grimm affair is a terrible blow tothe whole official, journalistic and popular Germanophileparty in German-speaking Switzerland.G.
