G.T. 1136.WAR CABINET, 114FUTURE NAVAL CONSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES.(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).IK   &apos;I gather from the Minute.&quot; of the War Cabinet that I amsupposed to havd promised to prepare a statement about a suggestion,which I have put forward in order to enable the American NavyDepartment to divert all their energies from the task of buildingcapital ships - which would be useless during the present war -to&quot; the construction of destroyers and. other antisubmarine craft -which arc urgently required.The reason,  and the only reason so far as I am aware,which prevents the Navy Department from carrying out this policy -which they admit to be desirable so far as the present war isconcerned - is that, when the present war is over,  they may findthemselves, with a much smaller fleet cf capital ships than theyhad originally designed to build,  in the face of a German Fleet(which will still be powerful, because it does not cone out tofight its enemy,) and a Japanese Fleet Jwhich has no enemy tofight).   This,  say the Navy Department, is too great a risk forAmerica to run, and therefore, however reluctantly, we arc oom-pelled to employ money,  labour, and dockyard space on buildingships which are admittedly useless for the war on which we areen pa .e d .My suggestion is that for four years,  i.e., for the timerequired to build new capital ships, America should have a rightto call other Fleets to her assistance, in case of maritimeattack.This suggestion may, however, take more than one form.One of those would be a Treaty of mutual maritime defence betweenAmerica and Great Britain alone.   This ha&quot;, the immense advantageof being both simple and adequate,  and I confess that, for reasonsof high policy, there is nothing I should like more than a de-fensive Alliance with America, even for four years, as would becapable of extension and development,   should circumstances proveauspicious.   The objection to it arises out of our existingTreaty with Japan.   It is quite true that there -is.no logicalincompatibility between our actual Treaty with Japan and thissuggested Treaty with America.   Both are defensive.   If Japanattacked America, we should certainly, if appealed to, come toAmerica1s assistance, while,  if America attacked Japan, we shouldbe under no treaty obligation to join in the attack.   All thesame, I fear that any such simple Treaty with America might pro-due e a very unpleasant feeling in Tokio.   It would be regarded, sofar as Anglo-Japanese relations are concerned, as. the beginningof the end of an Alliance which has already lasted twenty yearsand has,  on the whole,  conduced to stability in internationalrelations in the Par last.   This ia danger not to be lightlyrun, and probably the best way of avoiding it - indeed, the onlyway that occurs to me - is to try to associate Japan from thebeginning with the new arrangement.This would have the triple effect of allaying Japanesefears,  of engaging Japanese support,  and of advertising the Treatyas a protection against Germany.   But, .if Japan is brought in, andif Germany.be marked out by. the very terms of the Treaty as thePower against whom precautions have to be taken, how can weavoid asking France to join with America, Japan,  and ouraelve3 ?
And, if nc ask France, fc** crui we avoid aafcing Italy ?   Itoetlamight peasifcly be excluded on the ground that her geographicalposition would prevent her ITavy iaicing any. important p^rt inthe struggle.   But this ar-^ument could cert inly not &quot;be usedagainst Italy, and though the performances cf   her fleet inthe present War are not very imprcnive, jealousy might malts herwish to join in an arrangement which would add to her dignityand involve Very little ri&amp; .The above arc the main arguments which have inducedme to fr^jne the proposed Treaty in the form in which it hanbeen circulated, (G,T. I090)but I am quite ready to believe thatcome better form may occur to my Colleagues, and I place myproposal before them in the definite and concrete formchiefly for convenience of discussion.(Initialled)   A.J.B.FOREIGN OFFICE,22nd June, 1917
