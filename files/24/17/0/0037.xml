This Document is tne Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.](Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   June 1917.113rn T    IV T.0*ONFIDENTIAL.AS the Cabinet are aware, Signor Orlando, the Italian Ministerof the Interior, was sent over to London recently expressly torepresent to His Majesty&apos;s Government the very grave results, bothmilitary and political, which the shortage of coal in Italy isproducing.Signor Orlando explained that before the war Italy hadimported coal at the approximate rate of 850,000 tons a month, andin view of the vastly increased demands made by the war themonthly quantity required to maintain the various services workingto their full capacity would have been at the rate of 1,100,000 tonsa month. Owing, however, to the impossibility of obtainingsufficient tonnage for the transport of this quantity of coal, it hadbeen necessary to cut down in the most drastic way the coaLrequirements of every service with the following result: Tons per month.	Arms and munition factories	200,000State railways (including military trans-	port)	240,000 (50 per cent, reduction.)Gas for munition factories	70,000Mercantile marine ..          ..	30,000Indirect war industries (including pro-	visions, clothing, &amp;c.)	00,000Secondary railways	80,000 (50 per cent, reduction.)	630,000Italian navy         ..	60,000	690,000During the first twenty-one weeks of this year, i.e., the1st January to the 26th May, the amount of coal delivered in Italyfrom all sources was 2,007,100 tons, which gives an average of95,576 tons per week, instead of the minimum weekly requirementsof 172,000 tons, i.e., a deficit of 44 per cent.Signor Orlando stated that since November last it had beenfound necessary to draw on the reserve stocks in order to make upfor the deficits in the quantities imported each month. Thesereserve stocks, he explained, amounted in October 1916 to 2,140,000tons. Owing to the steadily increasing amount which it had beennecessary to withdraw, the stocks had by the end of April last beenreduced to 335,000 tons, and would have been entirely exhaustedexcept for the drastic reductions which had been in force. Sincethat date, however, owing to the continued shortage, still furtherinroads must have been made upon this reserve of 335,000 tons withthe result that by the end of last month these reserves cannot haveamounted to much more than 200,000 tons.The quantity of coal which should be delivered in Italyduring June is estimated at 400,000 tons, of which approximately250,000 tons should be carried in Italian vessels, or in Britishor neutral vessels chartered by the Italian Government, so that itwould appear certain that during the course of this month theestimated reserve of 200,000 tons will be entirely exhausted. Unlesstherefore it is decided to draw on the naval reserve, the Italianmilitary authorities and munition factories would be dependent fortheir supplies upon the uncertain arrival of colliers.The foregoing considerations have been brought to the noticeof the American Government, who have been urged to supplementthe efforts made by the Naval and Shipping Authorities in thiscountry.
The immediate question, which it is desired to bring before theWar Cabinet in this paper, is the question of how far.it is possiblefor His Majestys Government to go in the way of providing coalfor Italy.Our undertaking with Italy is to give tonnage to carry 50,000tons of coal per month, and, in addition, in exchange for the use oftonnage controlled by Italy to bring ore home, we give a furtherquantity of about 100,000 tons a month. Thus, the total amount ofcoal we have agreed to supply per month is 150,000 10ns.In addition to this we shipped during May, beyond anythingguaranteed or promised, 30,000 tons.So far as the month of June is concerned, the Shipping Controlleris making arrangements to ship 50,000 additional tons, making200,000 tons in all for the month, but it is only possible to do thisby reducing supplies to our own Admiralty coaling stations.It will not in future be possible to maintain this increasedexport except- by reducing other requirements. The ShippingController estimates that the following reductions would be necessaryin order to provide the additional 50,000 tons per month needed tokeep the Italian supplies from this county up to 200,000 tonsper month : (a.) 37,500 tons reduction of wheat or munitions from Americaper month;or,(b.) 35,000   tons   reduction of ore  per month from theMediterranean.The^decision of the Cabinet is required as to ^1. Whether steps should be taken to cany out one of theeconomies suggested under (a) and (6) in order to supply Italy with200,000 tons a month.2. Whether it is possible to increase still further our suppliesto Italy beyond the figure of 200,000 tons per month.In this connection it should be explained that recent informationhas been received from Italy stating that an additional quantity of100,000 tons of coal will be required during the months of Julyand August beyond any requirements previously specified. Thisextra quantity is needed for the sugar factories. It is stated, that ifthese factories cannot be kept going the beet crop will be lost, theinterests of the peasant proprietors badly hit, and further tonnagerequired to convey sugar from Cuba or Java. Moreover, it isbecoming increasingly difficult for the Italians to provide shippingof their own to carry coal, or to charter shipping, so that unless weare able to keep at a high figure the amount of coal we undertaketo make arrangements to deliver, there is every prospect of a seriousdeficit occurring in Italy.In conclusion, it should be noted that the Shipping Controlleris of opinion that the Italian Government might fairly be expectedto draw to some extent upon the stock of coal in reserve for theItalian Navy, the figure of which he gives as (500,000 tons, in viewof the fact that the reserve seems excessive in comparison with therequirements of the British Grand Fleet at Scapa, which are at therate of about 1,000,000 tons per annum. On the other hand, it isto be observed that the most recent information shows that theItalian naval coal reserve is now reduced to 500,000 tons, and it isbelieved that our Admiralty are averse to the Italians being pressedto make further inroads on it. On this point, however, it would beuseful to obtain the considered opinion of the Admiralty.E. CJune 22, 1917.o
