SECRET. *wAii cabinet.G.T. 1107 &apos;V.report pit joint standing industrial councils issuedby a: sub-commit tee of the reconstruction committee.(War Cabinet 157 (12).)Memorandum &quot;by Mr. G,N. Barnes.fSerious difficulty must be anticipated with regard to thedecision-- of the War Cabinet that the Ministry of Labour sttpuldcirculate a report on Joint Standing Industrial Councils to theleading Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations, and also to theCommissioners on Industrial Unrest, with a view to ascertainingtheir general attitude to the proposed industrial councils at anearly date.   An enquiry has already been addressed to me by one ofthe Commissioners as to whether he was free to ask questions ofwitnesses bearing on the Report or to submit to prospective witness-es a copy of the Report, with a view to obtaining their consideredopinions. To this enquiry I have, of -course, replied in the negative.I should, like to urge the following considerations in favourof a revision of the War Cabinet decision:- -1,-   If the Report is circulated to the leading Unions andEmployers&apos; Associations it at once loses its confidential characterand will become a general subject for discussion, but not for freediscussion,2.   This will give rise to comp3.aints from the House ofCommons that an important State document like the Report shouldhave been circulated widely without their having the opportunityof reading it,30   It will give opponents of the scheme an opportunity ofmisrepresenting it because its precise nature will not be generallyknown,4,   More -important than any of these considerations is thefact that a great deal of the prevailing unrest arises from thebelief that the Government is not dealing seriously with theLabour question, and is not concerned about the position of thewprking-classes after the War.I     On the other hand the argument against publication wouldappear to rest on the apprehension that the Report might beregarded as embodying the Governments settled policy, and aslikely to give rise to controversy between Unions whose membersare skilled and those whose members are semi-skilled or unskilled.The first of these difficulties can, I think,, be surmounted if theReport is publi siied with a covering letter explaining that theRyport does not embody the Governments settled policy.   The second,difficulty would not,I think.arise as the Report would- necessarilybei circulated, t0 the Workers&apos; Unions and the National Union ofGeneral Labourers, and other Unions not concerned with theEngineering Trades..    Consequently,.the publication, of the Reportwould not gjve rise to the belief that it was intended solely ormainly to deal with *the difficult quest ions, which will arise inthe; engineering industry after.the War.
-2** jIn addition to the reasons given above in favour ofpublication, I feel very strongly that the issue of anydocument which showed that the Government was taking a realinterest in the future of labour would have a most beneficialeffect both at home and with the Armies in the field.     Onthe other hand, if the Report is circulated in accordancewith the War Cabinet decision but is not openly published,the scheme may be prejudiced through the misrepresentationand misunderstanding which is likely to arise through garbledversions of the Report becoming current.       Such a resultwould, I think, be deplorable and i therefore feel justifiedin bringing the matter at once to the notice of my colleagues.(Intd.)   G.K.B.19th June, 1917.
