JWAR QABIBBT.MMORAJBUM Of HJSff gKQQMMMj.In reviewing the probabilities of German constructionas far as is known by the Intelligence Division, ana alsofor reasons which have shewn themselves since the lastWarship Building Programme was approved, it has becomenecessary for the Board of Admiralty to consider thefuture policy of Warship Buildings   As a result of thisconsideration the following additions to the presentapproved programme are necessary.The question has also been considered by thecontroller and his Department from the point of viewof production, and the cumbers asked for are consideredby him to be capable of completion within the periodstated, i.e. by December 1918.The War Cabinet approved the construction of4 Seaplane Carriers *   -2wo Mercantile ships underconstruction have been c^s-ken^ ovatf andi are being convertedfor use as Seaplane Carriers,   and a design has beenworked out for the remaining two.   It is found that thelatter will take at least 17 or 10 months to build, andmay hamper other shipbuilding, notably Light Cruisersand Minesweepers.    The 2ommaader-in-Chief, Grand Pleatsis very strongly of the opinion that at least oneadditional Seaplane Carrier with hl$i speed should becompleted by tho Spring of 1918.     This is also theopinion of the Admiralty and it has therefore beendecided to alter the &quot;OAVKHDISH (&quot;RALBIOT4 Glass) andconvert her into a Seaplane Harrier, as this can bo donewith practically no delay to her original date of completionit must at the same time be recognised that avessel;
converted in this way cannot perform the duties ofa high speed Seaplane Carrier bo effectively or convenientlyas a vessel designed for the special service, and enquiriesare being made with the object of ascertaining whethersuch a vessel can be built without throwing too heagy ademand on the available resources of labour and material,LIONS CRUISES *In addition to.the approved programme, it isproposed t-o lay down an additional 8 Light Cruisers of the0 &amp; D* Glass,   2his was the number previously approvedin the November programme, but War Cabinet suspendedtheir construction.     The shortage of Light Cruiserslander existing conditions has been a matter of seriousconsideration, and in view of the Cerman programme, it isconsidered essential that this additional number shouldnow be proceeded with, and, provided approval Is given atonce, these additional ships can be completed by December1918*     It should be noted that the construction of theseships requires the same amount of steol as BiK Standardvessels, which means from 44,000 to 48,ooo tons totaldead-weight capacity,   B-nch a relatively small amount wouldhardly compensate for ravming tho risk involved in ashortage of Light Cruisers for the Srand fleet, which canbe seen by comparing the estimated strengths of the twoFleets in this respect in December 1918;-December 1918,German LigCruisers*ghtBritish Light Cruisersin the Grand Pieet746    0(Including 8 new proposed) his includes 4 older attached Cruisersof the &quot;BOABICSA&quot; type.DBSfgOiERS,
m&amp;$ ROYISRB.. It is found that an additional 34 vessels can bebuilt by December 1918 by Admiralty Firms employed on thiselasg of work, and it is pvoposed to place orders for thataumfeer in view of %he very great requirements for Destroyers.$tJBMMXIiEi...,As far as is known the German rale of constructionin Submarines is about 15 per month, and it is thereforevary essential that the rate of British Submarine eonstruetionwhich is far less should he accelerated as much as? possible.The War Cabinet approved the construction up to Beeember 1918of 24 n*h Class and 34 Cruiser &quot;X,&quot; Clsusa and IS        Class.Slid these vessels have been ordered.   The WHW Class ofvessel ds of aiiaple construction and can fee built muchquicker than any other class, and it has therefore been con-aide red Aether our Submarine fareas oeuld be au$sented moreespeditiously by ordering more vessels of this clasa.   ItIs considered possible to order 18 *%* Class. 8 of whichwould be in p^&amp;ee of 4 HLH Boats already approved, and insome oasee to substitute &quot;K* Class for the &quot;X^s9 of theapproved programme, in order to aecner&amp;te cbmpletlott**    PATRQt BOATS,It Is proposed to order feur additional vesselswhich can be completed by the end of 1918.Arrangements are note being made to divide the Ship-building Yards of the country into two clauses, via:-(a).  Shipyards for bora,  i&amp;e Warships (Light Cruisers,destroyers, fatrol Boats &amp; Submarines).f
(h)   Auxiliary Graft (Klnesweepere, Trawlers, Drifters)and Kerchant Ships, and all vessels for otherQovermnEEft Departments,Jt is hoped in this way to work the various Yardsto the best advantage ma to obtain the maximum output.$he above lav^X JfregraaMt will oe placed with theFirms included in Class *A* and ean be aarried out withoutencroaching on the accommodation (as at I)) reserved forMercantile construction.The approval of the War Cabinet is desired,(Sd.)
