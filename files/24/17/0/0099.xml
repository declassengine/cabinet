[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]Printed for theI War Cabinet.   June 1917.SECRET. -oO.*t  - . - ...INDIAN BEEOHMS,THE Secretary of State and the Viceroy are pressing for an&apos;*early statement of the views and intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-in ent with regard to the future Government of India. The mass ofpapers with which I have been favoured, covering between 100 and150 pages of print, is so great that it has been impossible to readthem through except upon disjointed and scattered occasions; whileto write upon them thoughtfully or consecutively in the presentpress of business has been almost impossible. I submit the follow-ing remarks therefore with much diffidence, and solely in order toavoid further delay.If the case for a decided forward move be pressed and conceded,I should like to make it clear that it is not at all on the groundson which it is popularly believed to rest.1. Indian soldiers have rendered . loyal, uncomplaining, andvaliant service in the various theatres of war-as they have neverfailed to do in the past and India generally has observed anattitude of expectant tranquillity, which has enabJed the Govern-ment of India to denude the country of much larger numbers oftroops than would at one time have been thought feasible or wise.But it is not because of India&apos;s part in the war that she ought nowto be rewarded. As a matter of fact her share, in proportion toher means and resources, has been less than that of any otherconsiderable part of the Empire. No other part has suffered lessor reaped greater advantage from the war. All the expenses ofher army have been paid for except those which she would haveborne had they remained in India. Her financial contribution to thewar, until the recent loan (which was a loan and not a gift), wasinfinitesimal. India has had to bear no taxation comparable withthat which has been imposed at home. Enormous profits havebeen enjoyed by her business and trading community. Not one in&apos; 3,000 of her population has suffered in the,, smallest degree fromthe war. The classes to whom it is now proposed to offer additionalconcessions have no right to claim them on the ground of warservice, for they have rendered no such service. On the other hand,those who have helped us most in the war neither ask for nor wantthe particular reforms that are now under discussion. If I amright in this general statement, it is on grounds entirely differentfrom contribution to the war, and in no sense as a reward for warloyalty, that the proposals of the Viceroy and the Secretary of Stateought to be considered.2. Neither can it be contended that one of those milestoneshas been reached in Indian history at which constitutional reformis the legitimate outcome of acquired experience or is itselfoverdue. Thirty-three years elapsed between the first IndianCouncils Act of 1861 and the Indian Councils Act, which, asUnder-Secretary for India^ I carried through the House of Commons[738]
-z(in the time of Lord Cross and Lord Lansdowne) in 1892*Sixteen years passed between this Act and the next greatforward step in the legislation of Lord Morley and Lord Minto in1909., Eight years only have now elapsed, and we are invited tomake a further considerable move. It will be observed that theprogression is strictly geometrical, and if the same rate he main-tained, we may expect another demand in four years from now,and an even more rapid acceleration as time passes. These arenot merely fanciful or hypothetical calculations. It is a profoundtruth in cases such as these that the pace you set is one whichyou may easily accelerate but can with difficulty reduce.Even allowing that in the last three years of the eight to whichI refer the world has moved more rapidly than in any corresponding,period of modern history, the fact remains that there is nothingeither in the recent experience or in the internal needs of Indiato call for a further expansion now.If, then, the need for such expansion be admitted, let it hefrankly acknowledged that it arises neither because the war hasjustified it, nor because experience demands it, but because in thecourse of the war forces have been let loose, ideas have found vent,aspirations have been formulated, which were either dormant beforeor which in a short space of time have received an almost incredibledevelopment. We are really making concessions to India, as theSecretary of State has himself admitted, because of the free talkabout liberty, democracy, nationality, and self-government whichhave become the common shibboleths of the Allies, and becausewe are expected to translate into practice in our own domestichousehold the sentiments which we have so enthusiastically preachedto others. The Bussian revolution has lent an immense momentumto this tide, and will, I expect (whatever its issue), be recognised inthe future as a landmark in history comparable writh and verylikely much more disturbing than the Erench devolution. Wehave even weakened our power of resistance, if there had been anyinclination to resist, by our oWn magnanimity. Eor there can bedoubt that the admission of three Indian representatives to theImperial War Cabinet, and the manner in which they were receivedand treated there and in Great Britain generally, has enormouslywhetted the appetite of Indian politicians for political concessions.Placing&apos; the case in this, which appears to me to be its properperspective, our decision should be shaped partly by considerationsof expediency, i.e., what the present situation demands; still moreupon as long-sighted a view as it is possible to take of what thefuture may be expected to bring. Of the first group of con-siderations those who are now responsible for the Government ofIndia are the best judges, and one who left India only ten yearsago is almost out of date. Upon the second and larger issueeveryone is entitled to form an opinion. But I do not dissent fromthe broad view that in some form or other the statement isdesirable that self-government within the British Empire is thegoal at which we aim. I lay stress, however, upon accompanyingthe statement by a definite asseveration that it is under Britishguidance that this end must be pursued, and can alone be achieved,,and that there is no intention to weaken the essential safeguards ofBritish justice and British power.I agree with the Secretary of State in regarding the formulaproposed by the Government of India in paragraph 35 of theirdespatch as needlessly elaborate and formal. But I am not quiteclear as to the alternative phraseology which he would propose toemploy. He hints at the formula: &quot; Gradual development of freeinstitutions with a view to self-government.&quot; Perhaps this maybe susceptible of improvement when he submits the final form.He is of course conscious that whatever qualifications or restrictions
of language be now imposed, it is the admission of the goal and notthe introduction of the restrictions that will always be emphasisedin the future, and until that goal is attained we shall be constantlyexposed to the charge of being faithless to our pledges.Further, I am not quite clear by whom or in what \vay thedeclaration is to be made. I presume that it will be by the Yieeroyin India. I should be inclined to deprecate any pronouncement bythe Sovereign, since, if charges of non-fulfilment or tardy fulfilmentare forthcoming later on, it is very undesirable that they should beassociated with the Crown.Generally speaking, I agree with the Secretary of State ratherthan with the Government of India as to the nature of the suggestedreforms, in relation to the Imperial and Provincial LegislativeCouncils. But I entertain no shadow of doubt that these bodieswill gradually convert themselves into the very form, i.e., of smallParliaments, which. I ventured to forecast in the House of LordsDebates in 1909, and which Lord Morley repudiated with avehemence that was equally short-sighted and sincere. The realreform to work for is, however, not so much expansion of powers,as it is a more representative class of non-official member. Ibelieve that an examination would show that quite 75 per cent, ofthe elected members of the Indian Legislative Council arelawyers. The legal element is supposed somewhat to overshadowour Parliaments and Governments here. But in India it is anever-present incubus, although it represents but an infinitesimalfraction of the entire population, and is -as a rule profoundlyindifferent to the welfare of the agricultural classes, who constitutebetween SO and 90 per cent, of the people.Personally I am more interested in the proposals to grantcommissions in the army to Indian officers (this is a true reward inpari materia for war services), and to set up an advisory Council ofPrinces than I am in the dissemination of parliamentaryinstitutions in India. And I think that as time passes by theLocal Governments will require to have much wider powersdevolved upon them, although I see that the natural corollary ofthis will be the weakening of the power of the Supreme Govern-ment, which will tend to become more ornamental and lesseffective a result that is, I imagine, inevitable, but is on manygrounds much to be deplored.As to a Committee or Commission, I do not feel quite happy.Such a body must apparently both go to India and sit at home.If it is mainly or exclusively composed of persons who have noknowledge of India, it may commit grave blunders. On the otherhand, if ^it consists mainly of experienced Indian administrators,they will be regarded as biassed. Doubtless the Secretary of Statewill explain his views, and it will be very desirable to knowwhether its recommendations are to be invested with a quasi-sacrosanct character like those of the Speakers Conference onElectoral Reform, or whether the two Governments are to retaina free hand with regard to them. I hope sincerely that the latterwill be the case, since the proposal of a fresh body ofIndian reforms which were neither those of the Government ofIndia nor those of the Secretary of State, but something quitedifferent and very likely impracticable, might be fraught withgreat danger. Much will depend upon the choice of Chairman.Broadly speaking, I think that if the Government decides tomove in the various directions indicated, while it moves withcircumspection, it should also act with generosity, and not attemptto take back with one hand what it gives with the other. Thestrongest case for moving, at all is, I think, that if the Governmentdoes not take charge of the operation, someone else will (a HomeRule movement in India is already active and increasing), andthex may easily grow up a disaffection that would soon become
dangerous. Among the many lessons the war jias taught us is theenormous weight of organised /forces of men, possessing the means,-whether by industrial devices or by numerical superiority, ofenforcing their views. And this is a lesson which, if the East wereto learn it thoroughly and to act upon it unitedly, might bring themission of the West in India-in itself an. ennobling duty-to anabrupt end.1 0. of K.June 27, 1917. .PRINTED AT THE FOBEIGN OFFICE BY cY R.
