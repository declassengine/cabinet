SECRETG..T..-.1196WAR CABINET 3 3PERSIA.&apos;.    . .POLITICAL.Decipher, ,Sir .C. Marling,:..(Teheran), Julie ITth7 1917..D0 1.3.0..-.p.m. June 17th, 1917,Re. 8.O.. a.nu June 18th;.. 1917.-.No. 212 (D). ..My telegram NoQ- 206..Russian Charge d1Affaires thinks that it is most improbablethat Russian Minister rs&quot; instructions will differ materially froithose he has received himself viz:.- to express general sympathywith Persian National aspirations and disavow any aggressiveintention on the part of Russia against Persia or desire tointerfere in her internal affairs. . If this should prove to bethe ease,-and, as it seems probable, Russian policy towardsthis country at least for the immediate future will, bematerially altered or at least that wo,need not apprehend anyaggression, I would call Your Lordship&apos;s consideration to .whether we :should not endeavour to regain old. confidence in.British friendliness that existed before the conclusion ofthe 1907 Convent ion.Persians recognise quite well that that Convention wasa defensive measure on our part and that in any coercivemeasures (and the August Agreement is regarded by them inthat light): which the two Powers have subsequently taken .our assent has been reluctant and I believe that a spontaneous,offer to tear, up the 1907 Convention as far .as it concernsPersia and to. discuss again provisions.of August Agreementwould go far to regain for us esteem- forfeited by them and byplacing us again in the position of friendly advisers, affordthe chance of persuading Persia&apos; to accept foreign help insetting her house in order,.    If as may be anticipatedRussia no longer desires to insist on August^Agreement asfar as it concerns her&apos;.;and the increaso of Coasack Brigadeand ,joint. financial control thus disappeared, we. shall findourselves in tho. position of having to impose British-financial control and tho Southern Persia Rifles on PersiaJsacceptance,,     Just as the signature of Agreement. ?/as broughtabout by the presence of Russian troops, so troops will benecessary to enforce its execution,, . I .can. scarcely -imagine, even if troops are available, His Majesty1sGovernment-would contemplate, a measure which appears tome repugnant to our .national sentiment .and incompatiblewith-principle, for which-we are now fighting...Persia is moving fast to anarchy and while I haveno belief whatever in her self&quot;regeneration I urge thatour.better course to save her is to give support to thefew native elements that desire better state&apos;of thingsrather than to, alienate - them by trying to.impose reform. .Repeated to- Petrograd..
