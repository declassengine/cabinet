SECRET.FSW/004.WEEKLY REPORT OE SPAIH.  IV.June 26, 1917,The main interest of the situation in Spain, I said last week,is internal, not external-.     So it remains.   Spanish neutralitymay become rather more friendly to us under Senor Dato than It wasunder the. Marquis of Alhucemas;   indeed it is so, as may be seen byits action about sending us potatoes;   but it will remain neutrality.If there had been any doubt about this before, which there was not,it would have been removed by the attitude of the officers of theArmy in their recent &apos;pronunciamiento1.    Of course nothing hasappeared In the newspapers, but it Is privately known that theyinsisted that above all things there was to be no policy leading towar, for ivhich the Army, long neglected and badly administered,was totally unready.   Any ideas, therefore, of actual intervention,such as Count Romanones was thought to contemplate and Sen&amp;r Lerroux   -demands, may be put aside as outside the practical possibilitiesat any rate for a long time to come.    In every continental countrythe fiery temper and professional ambition of the corps of officershave always been regarded as the chief danger to peace.   But when thetorch itself becomes the extinguisher in this singular fashion,the peace of Spain is safe indeed.   If the Army will not have war,who can compel it?As to the domestic situation, there is not much to add towhat was said last week.   There have been strikes or threateningsof strikes, but no serious disturbance, and Madrid remains perfectlycalm;   much more interested in a great Bull Fight than in the crisis,and much more inclined to acclaim the new Toreador than the new
/I3132 . j^ prime Minister I   The full meaning of the recent crisis is still      \obscure, and it is not very easy to answer the two most interesting -questions which arise out of it.   How far were the victoriousofficers actuated by political motives?   That is the first.   Andthe second is akin to it.   What is the explanation of the curiousfact that much of the Radical press has rejoiced in the officers7coup d&apos;etat in spite of the fact that it is obviously a defianceof the civil Government on the part of the Army,tl^-e very thingLiberal tradition has always most abhorred?A real answer to these questions can only come later.     Atpresent all that can be said with any assurance is that the officerswere mainly actuated by professional motives.    It seems certain thattheir movement was not primarily political.   If their demands hadbeen resisted they might have forced a revolution of one kind oranother;   and even now that they have got what they asked theiraction can hardly fail to have political results.   A Governmentwhich has been successfully defied by its Army is one vhich hasdisplayed its weakness and almost invited other kinds of defiance.But it seems certain that these results were not the results theofficers aimed at securing.   Tvhat the best of them wanted Has a realimprovement in Army administration and an abolition of favouritismand jobbery;   what others wanted was medals and promotion for them-selves instead of for other people.   Both have at least got promises,more or less precise, of their desires;    end both have got the all-important, and from the civil point of view, fatal, concession of theright to maintain their Committees.   The one immediate, visible and-almost amusing-result is that, asking for promotion by seniority,which has been granted them, they have been shown its logicalconsequence in the appointment of a Minister for War who is aged 86!The political significance of their action is to be looked for intwo directions.    It is privately known that they discussed certain
solutions in the event of their demands being refused.   Thesesolutions all involved Revolution, one being a Carl1st regime,another the substitution of the King&apos;s brother-in-law for himself,and a third the Republic.   All three had their supporters.   Thisfact seems to prove two things.   First, that the officers are onlyloyal to the King on condition of their own interests beingsecured.   Second, that the non-Republican majority are totallywithout political instinct.   Nothing can be more absurd than toSuppose that it is possible to dethrone the present King withoutdestroying the institution of Monarchy.   Nothing is more certainthan&quot; that if Alfonso cannot save the Monarchy nobody else can.He has, after all, experience, popularity, legitimacy and possessionon his side;   no other candidate would have any of these exceptso far as Don Jaime can claim legitimacy;    it is clear thatAlfonso and Monarchy will stand or fall together.   But all thisdeals with what might have happened if their demands had beenrejected.   As they have not been rejected the officers are nowunderstood to be anxiously obliterating so far as they can theevidence of their disloyal projects, and adopting as correct anattitude as possible.   But the acceptance of their demands has alsoits political importance.   And that not merely in laying bare theweakness of the Government, and inviting imitation by soldiers orworkmen.   The most remarkable thing about it has been the welcomeit has received from a large part of the Press, even of theLiberal Press,   It is true that the Socialists have made a publicdeclaration that they will oppose at any cost all measures con- -trary to the sovereignty of the civil power - that was to beexpected - what was not to be expected Is that the bulk of thedemocratic press actually welcomes the victory of the soldiers.One e ^the*a writes: -   &quot;The most serious aspect of the situationis that the extreme Liberals who from distatse of militarismwould under ordinary circumstances have stood up in defence of
law and order, remain passive.   This attitude is due. to thegeneral conviction that this seditious movement is a despairingprotest against the 2s oligarchy and nepotism which have long heldsway in high places1&apos;,And this interpretation is that of practically the wholePress, reactionary as well as liberal.   All regard it as an overtproof that the old system, compounded, as they allege, of privatejobbery and public make-believe, is now recognised as intolerable.The organ of Count Romanones, the ablest of the ruling politicians,alone or almost alone defends the present system.     The Armyorgan itself practically adopts the general interpretation, declar-ing that the action of   the officers is entirely removed frompolitics and solely directed against the &quot;Camarilla&quot; which has ruinedthe Arm .   In fact, the truth really appears to be, not as hasbeen stated in some quarters, that the Army has joined theRepublicans, but, on the other hand, that the Republicans forreasons of their own have looked on trith complacence at the actionof the Army.   Whatever the politics of the Army actually are, itdoes not appear so far either to have responded to the persistentblandishments of the pro-German press or to have done anythingparticular to show sympathy with the revolutionaries.   The attemptsat alliance have proceeded not from it but from the political parties.And the only open and public link it has either with the Carlistsand Maurists on the one side, or with the Republicans on the other,is that it has struck a blow at the existing regime to which bothalike are opposed.That is the significant feature of the present politicalsituation - But how important it is, and whether this generaldissatisfaction will lead to actual results or die away in barrenagitation, it is quite impossible to prophesy at present.
26.6.17.As this Report goes to press it is announced that theGovernment has suspended the Constitutional guarantees in view ofthe state of the country.   This, if true, will at least bringnatters to the proof and show whether the Government is or isnot master in its own house.
