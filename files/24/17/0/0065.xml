THE SOCIALIST LEADERS AND THE CENTRAL EUROPE PROJECT.Recents events in Russia have set in motion similar forces, in Germany andAustria-Hungary. One result of this has. been to drive the Governments of theCentral Powers into closer touch with the more &quot;moderate&quot; elements in theSocialist camp. . The German Chancellor has for a long time past been in very closeelations with Herr Scheidemann, the leader, of the German Majority Socialists, butrecent reports show that the leading Austrian Socialists, , Messrs. Renner, VictorAdler and Seitz, are being similarly consulted. Under these circumstances itbecomes important to understand the exact position, taken up towards the economicproblems of the settlement by the intellectual leaders of the Socialist Majority Party. :The address which is printed below has been selected as the clearest availableexposition of the views of the German and Austrian Majority Socialists on theeconomic issues of the war. It was delivered by Dr. Karl Renner as the openingpaper at a Conference held in Berlin on January 9th, 1916, to discuss &quot; the economic,rapprochement between Germany and Austria-Hungary.&quot; The Conference wasattended by representatives of the Social Democratic group in the German Reichstag,the Executive and Representative Council of the German Social Democratic Party,the Central Commission and Executives of the German Trade. Unions, the Central.Association of German Consumers&apos; Associations, the Social Democratic Party of:Austria and the Austrian Trade Unions. It will be noted that none but Germanspeaking organisations were represented. In the discussion which followed theaddress, of which a verbatim report has come to hand, 13. speakers took part, of,whom only two took up the &quot;minority&quot; standpoint and controverted the &quot;Central-European &quot; programme of the address.; No resolution was moved, as the meetinghad been called merely for the purpose of discussion and mutual enlightenment.The address is interesting as illustrating the close intellectual kinship thatexists between Prussian Militarism and the Marxian school of Socialism which isdominant in the Central Empires. Both justify their action on grounds of &quot; economicnecessity,&quot; and both ride roughshod&quot; over the wishes of the nationalities concerned..It will be noted that the speaker advocates the largest possible extension of &quot; CentralEurope,&quot; i.e., its extension to the Balkans and the Turkish Empire. One,of theminority speakers who raised the question as to whether the Balkan peoples ought,not to be consulted as to their own fate met with a very hostile reception. The.sketch of the tariff history of the world from 1848 to the present day also throws, ahinteresting light on the German point of view. .. -. The italics are exactly reproduced from the original.Comrades !,: In 20, 30 or 40 years&apos; time historians may perhaps succeed in ascertaining whbit was that precipitated this dreadful war, whether it was a ruler, or a diplomatist,or a soldier in high place. These are matters which can only be cleared up afterthe event by historical investigation. But one thing we know already, thanks to theinvestigations of economists, and that is that the war in the West I am not speakingnow of the nationality questions, in the East is mainly a result of the conflict of theeconomic interests of the great national capitalist societies. It is the imperialism ofthe capitalist states that is the ultimate cause of the war, and the chief bone ofcontention in their commercial policy is and always has been the question of tariffs.We are concerned to-day with a tariff rapprochement between the two Centra!Powers; but-before I deal in detail with the future form of tariff relationshipbetween Germany and Austria-Hungary, perhaps you will allow me to devote a fewwords to the question as td the position which the working-class takes up and oughtto take up towards this question in general. &apos; &quot; -A 0(33)3127 (2656-3J)  Wt. 9629-5&amp; r&apos;2b6 &quot;&apos;5/17  E&amp;S&quot;l      &quot;     *     &apos; - &apos;
2Social Democrats, as such,.; have - no special. cause ^to range themselves underthe banner of free trade. Free trade is a thoroughly capitalist formula for afar profounder conception, that of the &quot; economic international,&quot; i.e., of theestablishment of complete intimate and lasting.intercourse between all nations.Supposing that our movement had attained a fairly equal measure of developmentthroughout the world and had brought us into power in every country, we Socialistswould certainly be prepared to organise the world on the basis of this principleand -to ensure that all: peoples /shpuld ;Jjve s;deirby side in,the enjoyment of freedomand the fullest measure of economic intercourse. But it is too often forgotten thatwe are not yet in power, that we are everywhere in opposition, nowhere, indeedwithout influence, but nowhere in possession of decisive authority, and that theworld is not organised according to dur principles/ but according to the principlesof our opponents, the capitalists. Thus we find ourselves involved in a continualinner conflict a conflict, which 1 think Can truly be described as tragic when onelooks at the consequences &apos; to which it has led: Oh the one; hand, &apos; we &quot;proclaimthe principle of the international solidarity of states1 and the- greatest possibleeconomic intercourse and intimacy between peoples, while, on the other hand,we are bound hand and foot to the economic life of our oivn State and dependent uponthe prosperity or failure of the capitalists of our own country.&quot;I should like to carry this contrast a little further. Karl Marx says - that whenthe wage-earner sells his labour power to the bourgeois capitalist he retains anelement of freedom in that&apos; he is free/so to -speak/to carry his own body to market.This is the system which we are out to abolish. -And yet the fact remains-&apos;that evenwithin the framework&apos; of the &quot;society.: of to-day the workman cannot live unlesshe, - is successful in carrying his own body to -market. And this is true in aneven wider sense. When. the capitalist has appropriated lo himself the product ofthe workman&apos;s labour-power and adapted it to his own purposes he has not yetdone with it. He is still under the&apos;1 necessity of selling it. Very often this canonly be done in the world market, and if capitalists, in&apos; spite of their nationalorganisations, do not succeed in this and are; pushed out of the world market,it-means unemployment for the workers at home, perhaps even distress- for thewhole country. fiere,; as I see it, is the root of the tragic conflict-which, in spiteof our agreement on fundamental principles, leads to such difference of opinionand controversy in the ranks&apos;of our party. s -On Socialist principles we deny and we oppose capitalism. On Socialistprinciples we deny and we- oppose conflicts ;:between -peoples. i But the worldis not yet organised according to our principles, but&apos; according to the principlesof our opponents. However much we may recognise and proclaim in principlethe irreconcilable opposition between capitalist and Workman, we cannot refrainfrom also recognising that every individual workman is daily and hourly dependentupon capitalist society, and that under the conditions in which problems of socialpolicy are presented to&apos; us 1 to-day-the ^material dependence ; of the working classupon the success or failure of&apos; the capitalist in the market is undeniable. Thematerial dependence1 must &apos;never be allowed by the working class to&apos; become aspiritual dependence^ The&apos;fact; that the working class is interested&apos;in the successor failure of the capitalism of the &quot;Country-to; which it belongs must never beallowed to drive it into a moral capitulation to the capitalists. There are thetwo extremes.   On the one side,: there are&apos;those who&apos;;say are noton all fours with our interests ; let our interests give way to our principles &quot; ; onthe other there are those, who say, &quot; Our. interests must come first,; let us look.&quot; after our interests, and if ouiv principles &quot;do not agree with them let us alter our.&quot; principles.&quot; That is the contradiction &quot;which lies behind the controversies ofto-day. In the course of the remarks, that follow, although T cannot go as closelyas I should like into&apos;questions ot principle I shall do my best to make clear thebearings of this contradiction on, the subject of our present discussion &quot;and tosuggest how it may be solved.Let&apos;me say one more word by way of: introduction.   When I. speak of socialand political conflicts in the world, I would ask/you to remember that I startfrom the fundamental&apos; assumption that what&apos; we. have to deal with are conflictsheiween capitalist&apos; Societies.&apos; Pleasedo not think T am treating them simply asI&quot;Conflicts pfjtKe working&quot; classr&quot;Aft I say is&apos;that the,working class can be. interested;&apos;in:them in.a certain&apos; sense, and&apos; within certain&apos; limits.   What we have to deal with&quot;is&apos;a series of movements &quot;inside capitalist society-movements towards which ourown attitude cannot be free from a certain &quot;natural reserve.   &apos;
After these few words,.of caution, let us get to grips with the tariff question-that cockpit of conflicts throughout! the whole&apos; world. No estimate of the1 futurerelations between &quot;Germany and Austria-Hungary can be formed simply from astudy of the relations between these two States. Germany and Austria-Hungaryform part of the great economic community of the world and their mutual relationswill be determined, not simply by the conditions arising between them, but by .general conditions throughput the world.   It will be necessary, therefore, to describe......in broad Outline the salient features of the tariff history of the last generation.After the revolution of 1848, when, intellectually at any rate, the-principle offree trade was dominant throughout the world, the problem presented by theeconomic relationship between peoples seemed an easy one. Men looked at theworld map and found it a map of many colours, a collection Of states Of allkinds, some great, some small. The map might be compared to a mosaic, butwith this difference, that there was no kind of orderly or legal relationshipbetween the separate fragments. Each one of these Mates was sovereign andindependent. 1 According to the Free Trade idea each state was&apos; free to enjoythe blessings&apos;.of intercourse with &apos; its neighbours, an intercourse unhampered byrules and restrictions. &apos; Free trade was, in fact, a corollary to the anarchical systemof -laissez-faire in domestic policy. This idyllic condition was of short duration.The actual free trade period was extraordinarily brief, although the idea, as opposedto the fact, retained its hold On menVminds for a much longer period. In 1878Germany, under ;Bismarck&apos;s influence, went over to protection, beginning with amoderate tariff. It is a mistake to suppose that protectionism originated withBismarck on that his&apos;adoption of it was a gratuitous&quot; act Of policy. Both theUnited States and&apos; France had always been protectionist, and protectionist iri afar higher degree than the Germany of 1848-1878. Nevertheless the period ofprotection may be reckoned as beginning in 1878. Jt was from this time forwardthat the many greater and lesser states on the world map began to paint their -frontiers in firm outline by erecting tariff walls. . The effect of &quot;this was to reduceintercourse, but at first not to a great extent. In the early protectionist periodduties; were&apos; relatively&quot; moderate ;.the main object of the protection was to fosternative&quot; industries; &quot;it^was^not &quot;designed&quot; to&quot; exert pressure on foreign countries andto force open new markets for exports, but to supply home needs from homesources. During this period&quot;&apos; a- condition fof relatively free intercourse betweenstates was maintained by the system of mdst-favoured-nation treatment&apos;. After theabandonment of &apos; free&apos; trade mbst-fayoured-nation; treatment was a sort of half-hearted attempt .16 find a substitute for it. . Looked at in the light of historymost-favoured-natiqn treatment&apos; seemsi to .&apos;menot so much a &quot;stage in the directionof free trade in the future as the first landmark on a backward&apos;path.&apos; The effect of most-favoured-natioh&apos;treatment is that when a state makes a tariffconcession to a neighbouring state in any article of import, every other state whichhas&apos;&quot;.a commercial treaty&apos; with&apos; it shares in the concession. Thus every advantageg^ven. is &apos;,automatically&apos;extended over. the.&quot;whple&apos; range &quot;pi states which are contractingparties to comineircial&apos; treaties.&apos;&apos; Every single con cession, is as, it were; internatiorialisedand uriiversalisea. \ Tlie result of this&apos; is that the inost-favoured-nation clause, hasa most important effect&apos;in being a. bond between the many diffefent kinds of tariffareas, in establishing a ebinmon basis for world trade&apos;&apos;and. introducing into it anelement of * internationalism. After the free trade period, during the ^ years between1878 and 1897, which I call the. pre-irnperiKlist period of prbtectibhism,&apos;most-favoured-hation treatment operated as a substitute for free trade and was the really &quot;dominanteconomic system in the world.        :&apos;   .        .    &apos; &apos;      ;? &quot;After 1897, and especially after, 1900, there was. a change in the tariff positionthroughout the whole world.&quot; ,-A new spirit Came over^capitalist; society. &apos; Socialistshave written a great deal^ especially In Germany, about the economic transformationduring the last two decades.&quot; We have summed it up in the word &quot;imperialism &quot; ;but 1 believe that in spite of much, eateful work on this field, the working class ingeneral, and especially the working class&apos; ih other coiiiifnes, has very little idea asto the fundamental facts &quot;underlying- this transformation^ J thewhole process of capitalism, in the individitalwoilcshop,&quot; in the state and beyond theframework of the Ind^ \ ;&apos;\      &apos;: ;i 1 &apos;      &apos;&quot;&apos;- &apos;T should like&apos;&quot;to make clear to you what I mean when I speak of this transformationor upheaval in tariff policy. Gftback to the.year 1892. In that year the parliamentof Canada for; the first &quot;time addressed to the parli anient of the mother countrya request to abrpgate the most-fayoured-nation-clause,. arid&apos; to, give Canadian imports
preferential treatment in the mother country in return for the preferential treatment ofEnglish manufactured goods in Canada.   That is to say, Canada asked for theelimination of most-favoured-nation treatment in the relations between mother, countryand colony.   The English Government did not entertain the proposal.   J)o not forgetthat whereas Canada is in name and so far as sovereignty goes, subject to the EnglishGovernment, i.e., is politically speaking an English dependency, she enjoys fulleconomic independence, and that the Canadian Parliament has full powers to makeindependent decisions on tariff matters.   By virtue of this, the Canadian Parliament in1897, after the English Government had declined to entertain her request, introduceda new tariff covering the whole field of her imports, and embarked on the negotiationof commercial treaties in which the terms of this tariff could be lowered by bargaining,in accordance with the practice of the most-favoured-nation system, but decided atthe same time that English goods destined for Canada should, under all circumstances(whether the duty was as originally fixed or had been altered by commercial treaties),have a preference of about 20 per cent.   What was the effect of this?   It did notdo away with the most-favoured-nation clause.   Most-favoured-nation treatment con-tinued to,be accorded to all other countries, but it was abrogated with regard to onecountry, England.   Germany had long-standing commercial relations with Canada.What was the effect of this measure upon Germany and upon Canada&apos;s othercustomers?   German goods reached the Canadian frontier together with Englishgoods.   In spite of most-favoured-nation clause, English goods were given a preferenceof 20 per cent.   The result was that German goods were discouraged, and could onlyfind access to Canada when they were offered at a price low enough to cover thedifference of duty.   It is clear that that was injurious to the interest of Germany andother countries; as a matter of&apos; fact, the measure was particularly directed againstGermany.   The result was a tariff war between Germany and Canada.   Germanydeclared that according to the terms of her commercial treaty the most-favoured-nation clause should apply all round, and that if this was denied she would declareeconomic war.    The upshot of the story was that, after conflicts and discussionslasting for several years, matters remained where the Canadian Parliament hadplaced them most-favoured-nation treatment for all states but a preference&apos; forEngland.I have adduced this incident simply as - a typical illustration of the problemsof the imperialist era. Canada after all is only a small stone in the mosaic of states.Who cares about Canada ? But this violation of most-favoured-nation treatment didnot remain an isolated case. Other countries began to give one another preferencesin spite of the existence of most-favoured-nation treatment, which thus graduallyrecedes into a secondary position. It still remains the background,- as it were, ofinternational economic relations, but its sphere of action is limited. Anew methodor weapon of economic warfare comes into play, preferential treatment. It is firstadopted between the various states of North and Central America ; then it spread toSouth America. 1 cannot give details. I only washed to illustrate by the tariff warbetween Germany and Canada how it was that the violation of what 1 call the&quot; modified free trade system &quot; of most-favoured-nation treatment began. Since thenthe tariff relationships of the world have undergone a universal transformation. Thetariff map of the world has been completely changed a fact which has been far toolittle recognised generally and has especially been ignored by the working class, whoare, after all, ultimately the persons chiefly concerned.This transformation can briefly be described as follows: Russia, in itself anenormous complex of countries, raised a single tariff wall round her territory. Russiaused not to have a single tariff. Finland was outside the Russian Customs Union.Eastern Siberia, the whole of the eastern part of Asia, was.a free trade country.Within the last 20 years Russia has drawn Poland, Finland, the Caucasus, Siberia,all her conquests, within a single tariff system, and that a high tariff system, and alsoestablished special preferential relations between herself and Persia and Mongolia.In this part of the East there is thus one single tariff wall, which shuts out a verypromising part of the world from the merchants of other nations. When 1 say shutsout I do not mean, of course, complete exclusion, but only the placing of greaterdifficulties in the way of trade, i.e., that foreign imports are hampered and mademore costly to the extent of the protective tariff in general and the preferential tariffin particular.Consider for a moment the map of the world.   Take out the whole Russian\* Empire, as a single protected territory.-. -Add to , this,great. Customs Union theterritory administered by &quot;France.    In the period between 1848 and 1870, the
national state period, France was confined to the mother country and a few bid&apos;colonies. After 1870, in her imperialist epoch, she took Tunis, rounded it off bythe addition of Morocco, and gained a firm footing in Further India. In fact France,who has always been foremost in proclaiming the universal principles of humanityand political freedom, has been a supreme example of imperialist practice, pro-tectionist chicanery, and colonial spoliation. She has shut off her territory morecompletely and more decisively than any other country except Russia. Frenchadministration draAvs a distinction between ordinary and assimilated colonies. Thelatter are closely bound to the mother country by a system of mutual preferences, asystem of such a character that, contrasted with England, one can say of territorywhich France has occupied that it is very soon completely lost to foreign trade.Now take France, together with the whole of North-West Africa and part of South-East Asia and Central Africa, out of the mosaic of the world map and you haveexcluded a second more or less closed economic area remaining from the sphere ofabsolute free trade and the relative free trade of most-favoured-nation treatment.Add to this in the third place America. The States of Central America beganas early as the &apos;90s of the last century to accord preferential treatment to oneanother. These preferences have since been extended, and the United States ofNorth America have succeeded, under the auspices of the Monroe doctrine, inestablishing preferential dealings with practically all American States. You musttherefore take the whole of the American continent out of the mosaic of free inter-course. Add to this that Japan is making the same attempt with China; that Italy-one may hope with small effect, but still with every effort -has attempted tomonopolise the Eastern Mediterranean for her commerce. There remains onlyEngland England the classical land of free trade. It is true that wherever Englandhas had colonies the trade of -all countries,- and in particular of Germany, has hadopen access, and that the English system of free trade for a long time gave othernations the opportunity of fair competition. German socialist thinkers have paidspecial attention to this point, and quite rightly. The German working class hasalways been able to use England as an effective argument, and to point out thatEngland.has provided a nucleus for the idea of freedom of intercourse, a nucleusround which all those who believe in closer and fairer intercourse between thenations of the world can gather. If only Germany would adopt free trade and drawcloser to England all other states, it was hoped, would follow. And I am notashamed to say to-day that, as conditions then were, we were perfectly right in theviews we urged.But things have fallen out very differently. It is true that England, the mothercountry, has maintained the principle of free trade in spite of violent party conflicts.But all the English self-governing colonies, which constitute a greater England, haveabandoned the system of free trade. Canada was the first to grant English goods *apreference, a preference which in some cases amounts to one-third of the duty andalmost excludes the direct importation of German or French goods. Then, afterthe conquest of the Boer republics, the South African States made a Customs Unionand gave the mother country preferential treatment for the whole of South Africa.Australia and New Zealand followed on the same path. The result is that whileEngland still remains committed to free trade, her colonies are protectionist. Whatis the result ? The English manufacturer and the English merchant deliver goodsto these colonies at rates 10 to 30 per cent, cheaper than those of their competitors.If the German merchant and the German manufacturer wish to sell to the Englishcolonies they must deliver them cheaper by so much. The natural result is that theGerman manufacturer and merchant sell to English dealers, and English dealersdeliver the same goods under their own name. The so-called free trade system inEngland has become largely a matter of appearances so far as Germany and allother countries are concerned. It has not been maintained through devotion to theidea of free intercourse in general, but* for the advantage of the English merchantand the English re-export trade in continental goods.Moreover, it is more than probable, though up to the present it is not absolutelycertain, that the position of things in England before the war will not continueafterwards. It is not worth while to discuss whether England will remain a freetrade country or whether she will adopt protection. It is impossible to prove eitherproposition. My own impression is that it is impossible, both on financial groundsand out of consideration for the wishes of the colonies, that the free-trade systemshould be maintained. But however the decision may work out. nothing can alterthe fact that, broadly speaking, the whole British Empire can be struck&quot; out of the
map as a territory of preferential and relatively limited trade. And now, I ask,when we see all these excisions from the map of the world, w*hat remains overfox. us,9 , ;,..v&quot;. .. . .        .^ .. :.&apos;--7^&apos;r.\-^ r-&apos;-    ,- .: \, ,,.The territory which remains over, after you have taken, out the whole of Russia,the. whole of England and her colonies, the whole of France and her colonies, thewhole of America, and perhaps also the Japanified east of Asia,, is almost incon-siderable in extent, The world&apos;has been finally divided up into a few great economicareas, and the map of the world is no longer a variegated mosaic of many little, states,but consists .of a few great economic areas with broad and simple outlines, with a fewlittle mosaic stones of small states huddled in between them. ., There you have the tariff development of the.last two decades. It is a develop-ment which has not yet run its course. It will only be concluded when England hasactually abandoned free trade. But it seems to: be fixed in its tendency and to beirrevocable.   The path cannot, be retraced.Before we. take, up our own position in principle to this position we must askourselves another question. What has happened, to the technique of Customs inter-cQurse under these changed conditions ? Does mbst-favoured:natioh treatment actuallysurvive under these conditions, and, if so, what is there left of it ?.. In the first place most-favoured-nation treatment is really no longer a protection,but rather a sieve, and for that reason its function is no longer easily intelligible. Imay make myself clear by a concrete, example. When Caprivi was ImperialChancellor in the years 1902-4, during the memorable discussions over the Caprivisystem of commercial treaties, most-favoured-nation treatment was still regarded as astepping stone to free trade. It could be assumed that,most-favoured-nationtreatment would lead back to free trade. The German Social Democratic party,therefore, naturally assumed that commercial treaties under most-fayoured-nationtreatment conditions must lead to a reduction, of tariffs and voted for the Caprivicommercial treaties. But ten years later, during Prince Bulow&apos;s Chancellorship, whenGermany went over to high protection, when the corn, duties, in particular, were raised,and tariff walls were built up in all countries, though mbst-favdured-nation &quot;treatmentremained (as was necessary under the terms of the Treaty of Frankfurt) it was nolonger in a position to be a stepping stone to free trade. The tide was flowing allihthe other direction. We can see, therefore, that most-favoured-nation.treatment is nolonger of value as an,instrument for directing commercial policy into any definitechannel, either towards free trade or towards-protection. It must not be assumed,however, that it serves no useful purpose whatever. It is extremely. useful inperforming its,own particular function in equalising the conditions.of trade betweenthe various states, for making the tariff walls, be they,high or low,,of the same heightall, round, for in other words, internationalising them. I cannot go into closerdetail or explain the full value of the function thus performed ; but I cannot forbearto mention that most-favoured-nation treatment l^as been evaded by a number of tariffexpedients, and that this last refuge of the old free trade idea has become little betterthan a technical legal formula. In spite of the most-favoured-nation clause, stateshave been able to favour or intimidate one another, to the most extraordinary degree,according to the state of their mutual relations, in all sorts of-concealed ways.. Forinstance, special provisions about frontier traffic have been adopted in treaties,although it is obvious that such provisions apply only to one single state. Austria-Hungary used a provision about ,frontier traffic to inflict great injury upon Serbiaat a time when she was still in peaceful economic relations with that country. Otherevasions favour land traffic as against sea traffic, or vice versa. I should likebriefly to mention one example in order to bring, out how the adoption of the formulaof most-favoured-nation treatment by no means nssures an actual equality ofcommercial conditions., Let us assume we are dealing with the importation ofagricultural machinery into the agricultural district of East Prussia. Under most-favoured-nation conditions every importing^ country France, Austria, or England-would pay the same duty. But England is in the fortunate position of being able todeliver goods direct by sea, from Newcastle to Danzig. , Thus, owing, to the low costof. sea traffic, her machines could,reach Danzig far.more cheaply than if an Austrianengineering works had delivered the same machines by rail over the German border.In this way the mechanical equality assured by most-favoured-nation treatment is ofmaterial benefit to maritime as against inland countries in treating with a state withan extensive coast line. It is, therefore, not ayconcrefe violation of the idea of equaltreatment if a( distinction is made between land , and sea importation. Indeed, if wewere really minded to bring about an equality between England and the continental
states we should have to arrange tljat importers by sea should pay higher duties thanimporters by land. Different scales have in fact been adopted for different countriesby distinguishing  between land  and sea traffic and by prescribing particularroutes.&quot;, .        ;-    . . .    &apos;. -j       - il &apos;  if.     .But .the greatest menace, a,menace that promises to reduce it practically to adead letter, has been brought against the most-favoured-nation system by the plan ofsubdividing the various items in the tariff list. In the old days. when, a tariff statedthat a horse paid 50 marks, it applied equally to all horses equally whether they wereRussian or Hungarian, or wherever they came from. But now the tariff runs &quot; horsesin general 50 marks, Norican horses 20 marks.&quot; Norican horses can still be importedon equal terms from Russia or from England. Legally speaking, most-favoured-nation treatment remains intact. The fact, however, is that Norican horses, which arebred in.the Pinzgau, are only imported from Austria, and that in this way the Austriantrade is favoured at the expense of the Russian. In this way one after the other ofthe relatively few items of the old tariffs have been subdivided, and the commoditiesso defined in such detail that in many cases the description applies only to a singlecountry. There has been a great deal of dispute in Austria with Italy over the wine dutyand the import of grapes. Our agrarians opposed the import of fresh grapes, and thetariff is therefore unusually high. When.it was found desirable to make concessions tothe.Italians on this,point we did not offer them grapes free of duty; that would havebeen a violation of most-favoured-nation treatment; what we were compelled to offerwas &quot;fruit for the table sent in parcels free of duty.&quot; We then placed obstacles inthe way of the import of grapes in parcels from other countries, and in this way gavethe Italians a special advantage. This is&apos; the way&quot; the most-favoured-nation treatmentis evaded. Similar differentiations were, made in other directions, according as towhether the sea voyage wasp direct or indirect. In the United States, for instance,goods which have not been imported on an American ship pay 10 per cent, extra.Another method is to say that goods which have come from Germany to America ona German or American ship pay at one rate, whereas goods which have come onneither a German nor an American ship, but in some other way, pay at a higher rate.In a word, most-favqured-nation treatment has, as it were, been hollowed out fromwithin in all sorts of ways. Add to this the fact that the Americans have arrangedtheir tariff in two parts, one of which contains a list of goods which are not subject tomost-fayoured-nation treatment at all, with results upon the general working of themost-fayoured-nation system which there is no time to describe here.. -Thus in the last 20 years most-favoured-nation treatment has entirely changedits character and with it the whole technique of customs arrangements. A goodexample, though certainly not a model, of the kind of arrangement that is being madenow is afforded by the three-tariff system of Canada. Canada has a three-decker tariff.There is firstly what is- called the autonomous tariff. Rates are fixed which are tobe valid as against foreign countries unless or until a commercial treaty is madewith the countries affected;. The. autonomous tariff is pre-eminently a fighting tariff.Secondly there is the tariff which is granted to states enjoying direct treaty relations.This tariff provides as a rule that all the contracting states shall enjoy most-favoured-nation-treatment. This may be described as a negotiated tariff. Up to this point theCanadian system is identical with our own. But now..comes the third tariff, thepreferential tariff. This tariff includes, all those special privileges which are reservedsolely for a friendly neighbour or for the mother country. Thus we see that most-favoured-nation treatment has not been, wholely abandoned ; it has simply been pushedon one side and reserved-for states with whom there are commercial treaties. Itis violated in respect of preferences granted to individual states with whom relationsare particularly friendly. This is what I may call the technique of the present system,and it seemed worth while dwelling on it in order to illustrate the problems of thepresent situation. oBut now that we have got so far and have seen the new geographical groupingof the.world and the customs arrangements associated with that grouping, let us drawthe consequences which follow from this whole course of development What is themoral, firstly for us Socialists, secondly for us as concerned with the problem ofAustria-Hungary and Germany ?In what direction is the world actually moving ? What is actually beginning ?We have been looking at isolated details of development, but what generalprinciple emerges from the whole story? What inward and determining law ofdevelopment can we trace in it? The answer I would give is a simple one. AVhatwe have before us is a development towards large-scale economic areas.   From thea 4
point of view of social policy we stand to-day at the culminating point of a longdevelopment. Long ago, in feudal times, the economic life of communities wascomplete within the limits of a single manor. You had a closed manorial economy.Then you had a gradual widening of frontiers until the town and its surroundingsbecame the economic area. You had a town economy. Then succeeded the periodof district economy reflected in political life by the district or State Governments.The single districts of Germany retained their own economic and customs frontiers(Prussia, Bavaria, Hesse, &amp;c), and remained in that condition for a long periodextending up to the year 1834. Then came a development towards a national economy.Individual small principalities and states concluded customs unions. The GermanCustoms Union of 1834 became a forerunner of the German empire, and theGerman empire is a single great economic area of the German people. Wecan trace the same&apos; development in other countries. To-day we have reached thepoint at which we are able to see, from the lessons of the development just described,that the national economic areas of the various sovereign bourgeoisies are becomingtoo small. These larger areas are drawing together into still, larger economicorganisations. What we are in fact witnessing is a development towards a worldeconomic area, towards our socialist project of economic internationalism. But thedevelopment is taking place in a confused and half-hearted and contradictory manner,mixed up with all the conflicts of capitalist society. It is a development into a fewlarge economic territories which will ultimately culminate- (as we Socialists are alreadyjustified to-day in predicting with certainty) in a single ordered international worldeconomy. Thus the problem with which we have to deal is a problem involving atendency of historical development development from the manor to the town, fromthe town to the district, to the nation, and thence to a single economic community forthe whole world. It is, however, not a conscious clear and united development, but onethat is impeded at every turn by the conflicts of capitalist society. Only when it islooked at in the light of history can the inner contradiction, the ebb and flow of the move-ment of the last generation, become clear. And what is this process ? It is the sameprocess of concentration that Karl Marx taught us to see throughout the whole range ofindustrial life. In early times there were innumerable small artisans working on theirown account. These have been replaced by the factory, the factory in its turn by thecartel, and we know that by the same law of concentration it is only a step from thecartel to the nationalisation of the means of production. We are already in a position todivine the corresponding process on another field. Parallel with the development ofthe small business into the large factory and thence to the cartel and to socialisation,is the development in commercial policy from the mediaeval mosaic of little states,by way of a few great world economic associations, that is of states associated as itwere in cartels, to a single ordered.world economy. It reflects the same process ofdevelopment and the same process of concentration.It is true that, looked at in detail, the development is not taking place as weimagined that it would. Let us examine the basis of our previous thinking on thesubject of commercial policy. Our point of view surely was something like this.Before us lies the variegated mosaic of states. That mosaic will remain; theindividual states will continue to exist as they are ; there will be no more alterations onthe map. But between all these states there will be free trade, and by a system ofcommercial treaties embodying free trade we shall arrive at a state of economic inter-nationalism without passing through a transition period and without the applicationof force. We imagined the whole development much in the same way as the earlyUtopian and small middle-class socialists imagined that they could build up socialismdirect out of the old system of small masters. But now we see that things haveturned out differently. The economic areas have passed through a period ofconcentration, and the first effect of this has been to arrange them in competinggroups, ranged in hostility one against the other. Nor is it sufficient for us to takeour stand on the ground of principle and to declare: &quot; This development is not our&quot; development; it is the result of the capitalist system which must bear the sole&quot; responsibility for it; it is the damnable system of imperialism.&quot; I agree,imperialism is damnable. We condemn imperialism just as we condemn capitalism.We condemn it in its every single action and at every stage of its development. Weare opposed in every way to this process of aggregation of great economic areas. Itis not our affair, but the affair of the capitalists, and if we alone are concerned wewould organise the world according to the free play of our own ideas withouttransition periods and terrible crises like the present. But no denial of responsibilityshould prevent us from recognising and admitting that we are faced by hard facts,actual concrete stages of development in a world which is different from our own
ideas of what it shoulckbe. If one ventures to refer to these hard facts one isexposed to the taunt that one is a &quot;convert.&quot; (Laughter.) Excuseme, comrades,hut socialism surely can never mean that we are not allowed to ^ introduce new factsinto our mental content. Now I shall have the other party to this controversy on myside when I say &quot;new facts, yes; but new principles, no.&quot; I have to deal with anever-changing body of facts, but my good old principles are quite sufficient to dealwith these new facts. I do not intend to &quot; revise &quot; my principles until it has beenmade clear to me that the facts prove them wrong. But I make bold to say that thefacts are verifying them; for what is happening is a process of historical developmenttowards the socialisation of the means of production and towards the international-isation of the whole economic order, i.e., the old Marxian process of socialisation bymeans of concentration, but under conditions of competition. Now that my eyes areopen to what this development is, my business is not to go on applying my principlesto a state of things which has become obsolete, but to use them for the new situation.(Very right.) But what I have to apply there is my old principle, it is socialism, it isthe class struggle. Such &quot; conversion &quot; as is needed is nothing more than the addingof new facts to my old body of knowledge, and he would be a traitor to the wholespirit of our movement who failed to go on adding to his knowledge day by day.But the fire which fuses these new facts into my consciousness can be nothing lessthan the fire of the socialist creed. (Loud applause.) So I believe that I have solvedthe contradiction of which I spoke at the beginning of my remarks. What I havesaid does not, of course, cover the whole ground. There are many separate problemsstill to be discussed; but it is worth a great deal to be assured of a guiding thread oftheory and to know what general position to take up in a wholly new situation.And now, I think, I have collected all the material necessary in order to answerthe question as to what attitude we should take up after the war towards a customsunion between Germany and Austria-Hungary. Here, however, I would repeat mywarning, that the working class is not in a position to solve this question on its ownaccount and to solve it according to its own ideas. If we were happy enough to bein such a position we should soon be finished with the job, for I believe that no greatdifficulties would emerge. But, as things are, the work can only be done by thecapitalists and their allies. We are only a minor contributory factor. What we have todecide, therefore, is in what direction and with what objects our contribution is to bemade.Now, I think, we ought to start by asking what our capitalist fellow citizens arethinking and feeling, what attitude they are taking up. I think that the German andAustro-Hungarian capitalist classes are feeling very uncomfortable. All the worldaround them is forming these large agreements and amalgamations, and when we askourselves what states there are to-day which enjoy no preferential tariffs we find that,generally speaking, with the exception of a few small states, only&apos; Germany andAustria-Hungary remain. Sweden and Norway, for instance, enjoy mutual reciprocity,so do Spain and Portugal. Even Russia has a preference with Persia and Mongolia.Leaving out of account small states which are negligible, we find only Germany andAustria-Hungary left side by side on the old basis. No wonder the capitalist classesof these two countries are getting frightened and beginning to say: if we are to facethis great economic amalgamation as two isolated communities shall we be strongenough to survive with the whole world against us? The purchasing power ofGermany and xAustria will be extraordinarily diminished after the war. The homemarket will no doubt have a large potential demand, but whether it will be an actualdemand is another question. Our agriculture, which had attained great prosperity,will be thrown back at least a decade by the events of the last two years ; the soilwill be worked out and the intensity of cultivation diminished. Moreover, our wholeindustrial apparatus has depreciated in value. Whereas in normal times ourmachinery is continually being overhauled and improved, we have had to go onworking during the war without regard for the future. Our machinery is worn outand will need to be renewed. Our industrial production has been driven into newchannels. It will need to be brought back again on to a peace basis. Huge quantitiesof raw material will have to be bought, and when we go out into the world market tobuy them we shall have nothing to sell, for our stores will haye been emptied, and bythe time the war has lasted two years or longer we shall find our foreigner customersused to other sources of supply. Our capitalists are, therefore, not unreasonablyfrightened. We have a perfect right to say to them: &quot; If you had only shown a little&quot; more conscience in the past.about questions of peace and war you would not haveopened your hearts so readily to the spirit of chauvinism ; most of what has happenedA  3127 R
&quot; is your own fault.&quot;   But what help is it to say that now ?   The capitalist oppressesthe working class both when he is prudent and when he&quot;is foolish.   If industry ishampered and&quot; markets are lost the capitalist will be loud in his complaints, but it isthe thousands of working people who will be ruined.   That is the tragic side of thewhole situation!   The others do not allow us to share in their joys, but we have to beara double and treble portion of their hardships.   Their triumphs are not our triumphs,but their&apos;sorrows are our sorrows, first, last and all the time.   Now the capitalists are&apos;saying to themselves that they will be in a bad position in general world-trade afterthe war and that therefore they must at all costs effect a reconciliation.   But thisreconciliation is a hard nut to crack.   It is most amusing for a Social Democrat towatch the German and Austrian capitalists in their desire for reconciliation.   Theyare eager to clasp one another to their breast; they want more than a rapprochement;they desire a complete and entire Union ; when, lq,they suddenly find themselves knockingup against the tariff icall which they have themselves erected.   They would like to bringabout a tariff rapprochement, but in their hearts they are all protectionists.   Theywould like to form an alliance, and yet all the time they are competitors.   Here oncemore we find the tragic conflict in which our capitalists are involved.   Each of themlias his own particular customs duty most at heart; each of them would best like toraise his own tariff and if possible also to diminish the size of his tariff area.   TheJunkers east of the Elbe and the Austrian agrarians would like to raise their pro-tectionist tariffs against one another ; yet at the same time they have to get on togethersomehow, and in spite of their protectionist inclinations, to allow one another mutualprivileges, to reduce the duties at the intervening frontier, and to double theprotected area.   Such-is the inner conflict in capitalist society which leads tosuch queer contortions of policy.    No wonder capitalists are in a most confusedstate of mind on the, subject&apos; themselves.   Unfortunately their perplexity hasinfected many of our own comrades.   Some of thern declare that it is a mad idea toimagine that the competing capitalists of Germany and Austria will enter into acustoms alliance.   It is quite true that German and Austrian capitalists are bittercompetitors, and that our Austrian manufacturers have had many heartsearchings overthe way in which the Germans have wheedled them out of the Balkans, and evenmade themselves noticeable in the Vienna market.   On the other hand, I believe theJunkers east of the Elbe, great as is their sympathy with their fellow Junkers inHungary (for they are both of the same breed), will not forgive the Magyars onesingle pig exported over the German border.   Both are competitors, and tariffs, ofcourse, are in themselves not a means for uniting men, but for dividing them.   Theyare, and must be, from the nature of the case, an instrument of conflict.   An economicrapprochement between Austria-Hungary and Germany is therefore, indeed, a mostdifficult problem ; and the.difficulty arises from the fact that those who hope to dealwith it are capitalists, competitors and protectionists.Many comrades are of opinion that for this reason the problem cannot and willnot be solved at all.   It may be so, but it will not be we who will make it impossible;of solution.   I agree that it is an extraordinarily difficult problem, and that ifGermany and Austria-Hungary were alone in the world they would never come toan,understanding and would probably continue their tariff war with the greatest fury.But they are not alone in the world atid we have to look at the question not from thepoint of view of the relations between these two states alone, but in the light of theconditions in the world as a whole, such as I have described them.   These twocapitalist societies stand over against one another like two Competing manufacturerswho are anxious to join in a cartel.   Just as in the case of a cartel the greatest; conflicts of interest are overcome under the compulsion of an economic necessity or; desirability, so in my opinion the capitalists will find that in spite of all theirinclinations towards a high tariff, a policy of combination is not only highly desirablebut also necessary.   I should like to point out what seems to me a literary curiosity.A German of the Empire, Nauman.n,has written an overture for this alliance betweenthe German and Austro-Hungarian capitalists, a sort of hymn or bridal song for the&quot;coming rnarri age -1 refer to his book &quot; Mitteleurbpa.&quot;   Whenever I read that book,greatly as I admire it, I cannot help chuckling all the time.   It is a book whichsets forth a great historical conception ; but the author has not the courage to comestraight before the people and say :&apos; Here is a great new idea which must be borninto the World, &apos;borh with pain and travail, if necessary.   No!   Naumanri feels&apos; compelled to go to the governing class and to the Capitalists and to appeal to&apos;themin carefully chosen phrases to explain that his idea is so beautiful, so virtuous, so,&apos; Christian, so humanitarian, so patriotic !   He has. to take each single vested interest
aside and whisper in its ear. He has to use unctuous words to win the heart of thecapitalists, a piece of work which he can accomplish to perfection; His book is,therefore, not calculated to impress Social Democrats. And yet the great funda-mental idea of the hook is really our own idea, namely, that we must contemplatea process of amalgamation into larger economic areas, or else, as things are, we shallnever get any further in the world at all. Or course, it is not for us to join in thebridal hymn.&quot; We can stand aloof from all this frippery. The plan, -as it stands, isnot socialism but a cartel and a cartel is certainly not a socialist project; in fact wehave the greatest suspicion of cartels. Nevertheless, although a cartel signifiesexploitation, and perhaps increased exploitation, still at the same time it is a newform of organisation and we welcome in it the husk in which our kernel will ripen.If Germany and Austria-Hungary should succeed in forming an economic alliance,this alliance will not be the Utopia of our dreams, it will bring us into no landflowing with milk and honey, and as to the condition of the working class underthe new regime, of that we know nothing as yet and can form no conception. Butit is a higher form of organisation in the world&apos;s economy, and thus provides at onceincreased safeguards for the present and better hopes for the future, for the workmanas for everyone else. We have no occasion to walk at the head of the processionwith cries of j ubilation, as some of our comrades seem to think, but also no occasionto stand entirely aside. Rather, it is our task to go calmly and carefully into thewhole programme in the same spirit of detachment in which we approach the otherproblems of capitalist society.But if this greater economic area is to come into existence we must be clear inour own minds as to what we have to gain by it.   I wish to speak here from theAustrian point of view, and to ad nut frankly that in this new association, if it comesabout, Austria will be the weaker party.   It is always a matter for grave con-sideration for a weaker party to enter into association with a stronger, because itruns the, risk of becoming swallowed up.   In Austria the view is widely held that aunion with Germany will simply result in Austria becoming a colony of Germany.Those who are opposed to the idea are fond of saying that the German capitalists havelost their oversea colonies and are looking for others at their own door ; in fact, thatthey regard Austria-Hungary as a colony.   I would go so far myself as to say thatthere are many Germans to whom that opens out a very attractive vista.   But mostGermans have the sense to know that colonies of this kind are very rebeUious andvery difficult to manage the sorj; of diet that is not at all easy to digest.   If Germansof the Empire were indulging in the hope that they would get a good meal out ofthis business they would be under a great illusion.   There is, therefore, very con-siderable resistance on the Austrian side.   There is, in fact, resistance on both sides.I do not need to go into all the objections in detail.   I am certain that if yourcapitalists were offered a good commercial treaty with Russia or with England theywould very soon leave Austria in the lurch (very true), and would live to regret it.The capitalists will therefore probably look at the question from a different point ofview from ourselves.   We know very well that many a small master in the strugglewith the great industry has lost his position as a master and found a more prosperousand important position in the industrial machine.   If a greater economic area isestablished we must reckon with the possibility of losing something for the moment,hut we on the Austrian side expect that what we, shaU lose will be smaH comparedwith the great gains that wiU accrue, not to us alone, but to both sides.   We believethat in a larger economic area development will be ever so much more rapid, so thatin place of two moderately strong competitors, each doing injury to the interests ofthe other, there will be two friends, each twice as strong as it was before.   Forwith the development towards large State production and with a market doubled insize, agriculture and industry will make rapid strides; it will become increasinglyspecialised; it will open out in all directions, experiment with methods, and cultivatenew markets.   Many of the districts thus opened up to industrialism will be inAustria, for as the price of coal rises water-power increases in. importance.   This willcause capital to flow to the Austrian Alps and the Carpathians, and our nearness tothe Balkans and to the Danube route will mean cheaper freights and so make up formany disadvantages.   As our standard of life improves our soil will be more rapidlybroken up and more scientifically cultivated.   As representatives of the working classthe one thing which we have to consider is that this process of transformation anddisplacement of labour should take place with a due and- necessary regard for theinterests of the working class.
An objection may be urged at tbis point. It is quite true, we may be told, thatlarger economic associations are a good thing in principle, but why should Germanyform such an association with. Austria-Hungary in particular; why not, say, withRussia, or why should not Austria-Hungary combine with Russia or the Balkans ?Or why not Germany with France ? If I can choose my associates where I like whyshould I choose this combination in particular ? It might, for instance, be urgedthat the Germans of the Empire are more modern and economically more powerfulthan the Austrians. Why should they burden themselves with so weak andunreliable a partner as Austria? Similarly, in Austria, people might say: theGermans by themselves are strong enough; we prefer to stick to Russia. Sucharguments would be all very well if combinations between states could be broughtabout as- easily and as arbitrarily as the shuffling of a pack of cards. But at thebottom of this combination is, as I think, something different from what exists inthe case of any other possible combination. If Germany and Austria are to becomea single economic area it will not be because Bismarck had a happy idea in 1877, but,as I believe, under the compulsion of historical necessity.1 will ask you to remember for a moment the historical significance of this CentralEurope of Naumann, that is to say, Germany plus Austria-Hungary.   To-day theGerman Empire is a sovereign state and Austria-Hungary is another sovereign state.In the eyes of international lawyers they are two entirely separate states.   But what hashistory to say to the matter ?   If you go back many hundred years to the treaty ofVerdun under Louis the Pious, the son of Charles the Great, you will find that thewhole territory which is occupied by Geimany and Austria-Hungary to-day has alwaysbeen united under a loose form of state government: throughout the history of athousand years that area has been the Holy Roman Empire.   The German Emperorshave throughout been also Kings of Hungary and Kings of Bohemia.   If this greatcommon territory of Central Europe was eventually broken up it was not through theactions of its inhabitants or through any internal popular conflicts, but because of therivalries of its dynasties.   If we have been kept apart by our notorious surplus ofcrowned heads it is because we have always had so many of them that we have beenable to export them, and have a good many too many of them still at ihe presentday.   (Laughter.)   When the war of 1866 broke out Bebel and the patriarchs of ourmovement did not regard it as a war between neighbours, but a war between brothers.That is true not only of Germans and Austrians; the&apos; Hungarians and the Czechsalso have always fulfilled their destiny in this common association.   And if you lookmore closely you will find that where this Central Europe reaches its easternmostlimit there is a fixed cultural frontier.   On the further side of that frontier thereis an alphabet, which we do not understand, a - different literature and culture;also different forms of economic life and a different type of human being.   Thesame is true towards the west.   Our two countries have really been in associationfrom time immemorial not a uniform standardised association by any means, notan association of individuals all exactly alike, but a federal association of many landsand peoples.   In Germanj1- institutions still retain this federal character.   We finda whole number of States, Saxony, Bavaria, Prussia, &amp;c, in the Empire, while Prussia. again is only a general name for a number of different races.   Each race haspreserved its.own individuality and yet Germany is economically a unity.   The fact isthat we have been separated by conflicts of interest between governments, dynasties,and bureaucracies.   Thus, we were entirely cut off from one another between 1866and 1878, and then only united by the dual alliance.   Later on, the bureaucraciesbecame rivals owing to the system of high protection.   But, just as in 1866 thewar was carried through against the protests of the working class, so too the systemof high protection was carried through against the protests of the working class.So far as the working class is concerned I have no doubt at all that from Hamburgto Trieste a single spirit and a single traditional education has created a completecommunity of thought among the working class.   So that if there is to be a newassociation it wdll not need to be patched up by the diplomatists.   On the contrary,whatever the diplomatists patch up will be but an imperfect expression of an actualstate of fellowship.   As a -working class I think we should proclaim it on ourbanners that the fellowship of the peoples and lands of Germany and Austria-Hungary is a natural article of our faith.   We have always been united in the spiritand we mean to remain united in the future.   The difficulties which others feelare no difficulties for us.   Even the nationalist objections are not valid for us, forwe claim to be internationalist, and in our eyes national autonomy is only the first
step towards a wider union. All these are conflicts of interest between dynasties,between governments, between bureaucrats and capitalists, not conflicts of interestbetween peoples. For this reason we shall welcome any form of association, thatis offered us and the firmer and more intimate it is the better we shall like it. Thedifficulties do not come from us, but from the capitalists. Nevertheless, I admitthat these difficulties are very formidable.These difficulties will only become clear on consideration of the various possibleforms of the rapprochement. I must, therefore, ask you to excuse me for a fewmoments more while I undertake to discuss how the rapprochement can be carriedthrough, and what concrete form it can take. The problem is to bring together twoclosed economic areas, each with its own special organisation; each roughly similarin respect of the material to be organised, but with different methods of organisation ;and each already in a state of maturity. One difficulty, for instance, is that each areahas a wholly different system of taxation. An entrepreneur who can just make hisbusiness pay in Germany could not do so in Austria because he would have to payheaven knows how many taxes there. The German entrepreneur who can competesuccessfully in foreign markets because of the. excellent system of transport, couldnot do so in Austria because of the inefficiency and expense of the Austrianrailways.Now, of course, there is one radical method of union. The rapprochementwould be most thorough and complete if the tariff barriers at the German-Austrianfrontier were simply withdrawn, if the two Governments boldly said: we are aunion, we knowr nothing of tariffs between parts of ourselves, we have only onecustoms frontier against the foreigner ; and that, too, must be as low as possible. Thatwould be a real customs union. We Socialists could, in principle, only welcome sucha union, but the capitalists would certainly offer immense resistance to it, becausetoo many material interests would be affected. If such a union did come to pass,there would certainly have to be a tariff between the. two countries for a given period,in order to facilitate the transition. It would be like having a hard skin towards theouter world and a soft skin betweeu the two members. But an economic unionof this kind, which has been in many men&apos;s minds recently and was an object ofaspiration in the forties of the last century, would hardly be acceptable to thecapitalists of to-day.So we have to fall back upon the conception of two customs areas, an Austro-Hungarian and a German, and to conceive of a rapprochement consisting of two mainpoints ; firstly, that both States undertake to act together towards foreign countries,and, secondly, that they will give one another preferential tariffs, those preferentialtariffs which are already familiar to you from the earlier part of my address.   Therewould thus be two customs areas with two tariffs, and each area would give prefe-rential rates to &quot;the other at the frontier.   For instance, both States might say: wewill go on making our own tariffs, but we will act together towards foreign countries,and in our mutual dealings we will only charge one another a half, or a third or two-thirds of what we charge the foreign importer.   In this way the three-tariff systemwhich I have described above would come into play, and a preferential tariff&apos; with special agreed rates for every article could be adopted.   But we must facethe possibility that the tariffs might remain completely separate and that the onlypoint of agreement reached would be the decision to act together towards foreigncountries ; even that would be a gain.   W^hen the two States have to replenishtheir raw material after the war, they will have to buy cotton in America; and rubber inLondon, and to import a whole number of other commodities,,rice, tropical products,metals,&quot; &amp;c.; if they were in a position to buy in concert in the world market insteadof competing, if they could protect their exchanges and safeguard themselves from aflow of gold to foreign countries, a very substantial gain would have been achieved.It is possible to have degrees of rapprochement, just as in the parallel case of cartels.There are cartels which have a common policy only as regards selling prices ; thereare other cartels which have common arrangements for manufacturing.   The bondbetween cartels may pass from one degree of intimacy to another until it reaches acomplete amalgamation.   The same is true of the problem we are discussing.   Thedecision as to which particular form of rapprochement is to be adopted is a decisionto be made from time to time, not a decision to be made once for all at any given;moment.   We ought not to regard the idea. of the rapprochement as a cut and driedscheme.   It. is not a question of drawing up a scheme in so and so many paragraphsand then dismissing the whole problem as solved once and for all.   Rather it is ahistorical process.to be completed by degrees-a process which requires.the workingB 3
out of a far-reaching programme. If we &quot;Conceive of/&apos; the work as !a historical processas a realisation of a large programme, the decision which we, as a party, have to makeis thrown into much clearer relief. Of course We must always remember that thecapitalists, however much they may appear to desire a rapprochement, are hamperedby their own protectionist prejudices. We are not similarly hampered. In myopinion, therefore, we ought to act not as a brake but rather as an impulsive force.We ought to demand a complete programme in the name of the future, even if thecapitalists are not prepared or in a position to give us all we ask.On the other hand there are great and important reservations of quite anotherkind, which we must on no account ignore.   If we were to go blindly into the schemeand to say &quot;it is a historical necessity; let it come to pass as it must,&quot; it would hemadness all the more so because those who will actually bring it to pass are them-selves nationalists and protectionists, because capitalism is in power and in a positionto pervert the natural development and to judge of questions of historical necessityfrom its own class point of view.   Undeniably there is a great danger that when thecapitalists do realise the project, especially if they do so without help from us, we shallget a mere caricature of an idea that is good in itself.   The capitalists are quite likelyto leave the old tariff between Austria and Germany standing and simply to raise thetariff against foreign countries and thus, instead of increasing human intercourse, toput new obstacles in its way.   If we take up the fundamental position that we are notout to do any fighting for the rapprochement then we shall leave capitalism toitself, and it is quite certain that the protectionist elements which are so strong andso sinister will come to the top.   Historical development is in the direction of alowering of tariffs just as it is in the direction of larger economic areas.  -If we do nottake an active part and attempt to control the policy of the capitalists we may beendangering the whole project.   The idea of the rapprochement indicates a certaintendency towards free trade, but this tendency can only be developed if we who arefree traders take part in the work and its realisation.   If we remained aloof andrefused to have anything to do with the whole thing, we should be leaving our cartelsand our Junkers to themselves and we should probably be turning Central Europeinto a bulwark of high protection.   We must certainly reserve our freedom of actionfor this eventuality, so that at the decisive moment we may be in a position to say &quot; ifthis is the kind of thing you are out for, we refuse to co-operate any longer.&quot;   Weought to go forward with them towards a facilitation of human intercourse and towardsa concentration of economic areas, but we ought to offer the strongest resistance if theproject turns out to be a mere system of high protection.   This reservation must bemade at all costs.I should like to make another reservation. If it&apos; is a question of enlargingeconomic areas and drawing together great economic territories the project is all themore likely to be successful the larger the scale on which it is designed. It seemsto me clear that it is not the fortune of war alone, but a certain economic and politicalnecessity which has led Germany and Austria-Hungary down the Danube, where theyare following the old Central European path of development. If, therefore, we arefaced with the possibility that Bulgaria, the Balkan States and Turkey may be drawninto the combination, it should be our business to press the idea with all the&quot;emphasis at our command, for the greater the association the more effective will itbe and the more accommodating will the private interests of its separate portionsbe forced to become. It cannot be overlooked that if these territories were includeda whole host of protectionist arguments would be put out of court. In an enlargedcombination of this kind it is certain that we could produce our own supply of bread ;to demand corn duties in a large area of this kind would be extraordinarily difficult.The greater the economic area the easier it will be to fan the latent spark of freetrade. A small state like Switzerland, which has three or four industries which formthe staple of her export, is forced by the needs of her industrial life to defend thesethree, or four industries ; her whole prosperity depends upon it and she is, therefore,driven to a system of high protection. But in large economic areas in which everykind of agricultural and industrial production is developed there is such an equilibriumbetween them that it is not necessary to protect individual trades. Even if one ortwo succumbed, the capital and labour involved would find scope enough in otherindustries. In a word, the greater the economic area the greater will be its tendencytowards free trade and the more effective will it be likely to be. In fact, after acertain point has been reached, large scale areas of this kind reach a position whenthey automatically go over to free trade; and it is just because of this considerationthat I am convinced that the enlargement of economic areas is a new road to our old
goal.   That is why we Social, Democrats ought, to support it and to say, &quot;Well,.ifyou want it, go the whole hog: if you want a union by all means draw in the BalkanStates and Bulgaria. .,   ,,       .  - .But I shall be faced with the objection, &quot;Yes, but what will be the result? Wedraw together. We establish a,larger economic. area. But does not that involvehostility towards everyone else? Shall we not be. cutting ourselves off from, thewhole world ? Will not the other countries protest and defend themselves and takeup the challenge, and thus provoke a new war ? &quot; . But remember for a moment whathappened in, the case of Canada. Germany at that time was not at all disposed tolet the thing pass,,but Germany had to take it as she found it. The English Empiredrew together, the French, Colonial. Empire has drawn together, Russia, has, drawnin Poland, Finland, &amp;c. None of our protests was of the least effect..; If we drawtogether now it will simply be the last refuge of the last survivors. Nobody wouldhave the least right to protest against it, nor has anyone any cause to do so. Asa matter of fact, an amalgamation of this kind is a considerable advantage even toforeign merchants. Put yourself in the position of a German merchant in Hamburg.Would he prefer to have the United States of America as a single economic areaor would he prefer to see as many different customs areas as there are single Statesin the Union ? Of course, he would rather do business with a single customs unionthan with a number of small markets. I do not think, therefore, that seriousobjection can be taken to such a development as I have sketched.But there is a second danger against which we must be on our guard thedanger that this economic association will be entangled with other non-economicquestions, with military questions or with the so-called fellowship of the trenches, orwith the whole political and military apparatus of dynasties, bureaucracies, and soldiers.That would be the ruin of the whole design. Let the two separate armies remainwith their own organisations. The Austrian State is strong enough to support thesame armaments as Germany. As a composite state it can never have the samemilitary organisation as a nation State. For that reason it would be dangerous initself to mix up the military question with the economic question, besides beingcontrary to every Social Democratic ideal. (Very right.) The two empires havedefended themselves against a world of foes- on their present basis, and mistakes aremore easily corrected by the party concerned than through the pressure of a guardianfrom outside.More important still do I regard it to preserve the new alliance from thechauvinistic appetites of the nationalists. I beg you to take note of the fact thatresistance to the project will assume insuperable proportions if, as the Germanimperialists desire; Germany is to use the other States simply as instruments, or ifpan-German fantastics saw in the whole project only an opportunity for makingconquests for the German language. The moment the rapprochement appears in thegarb of nationalism you will at once have to face the opposition of the Hungarians andCzechs and all the other nations, and all hopes of a useful development will at once bedashed. The project must not be conceived in a nationalist or imperialist spirit, andthe national autonomy of the peoples of Austria-Hungary and of the Balkans must bepreserved and respected. Under no other conditions can the project be realised. Handsoff ! is our cry to militarist designs as to ^projects of nationalist expansion. Treat thequestion as a pure problem of economics ; that is the demand which we Social Democratshave to associate with, our consideration of it. If we are not strong enough to insistupon these considerations then it is certain, not only that the idea will never be realisedat all but that out of its failure still greater dangers will arise for both empires. It isthe duty of the Socialists of both countries to see that the question is approached inthe right spirit. If we approach it in the right spirit ourselves we shall be raisingit to a higher plane. How did England bring her empire into existence ? ,Bvconquests on sea and on land. How did Russia create her empire ? By conquestsand enslavement. But we shall be making history along another road, we shall beestablishing an economic empire not by the sword and the subjection of the manyby a single power, but by treaties, by the free union of Germany and Austria-Hungary, of Bulgaria and Turkey. That is a much more difficult task than it was forEngland to overthrow the Boer republics. It is true that England learnt later onto win the loyalty of peoples conquered by the sword through the grant ofautomony, but our problem to-day is to secure, the union of three or more states bytheir own voluntary action and to persuade them to regard all their individualinterests as of less importance than a common idea. Only thus can the historicachievement come about.   That is something quite different from imperialism.   IfB4
&quot;the objection is urged that the union is itself imperialism the answer must be : &quot;yes, in&quot; its outer form and working it is imperialism, but m the one point which matters it is&quot; not &quot; It will not be the compulsion of arms or the compulsion of tariffs which willhave Drought it about. It will be the free union of states and the mutual loweringof tariffs. This union must, if it is to succeed, be a free association and therefore weSocial Democrats have the right and the duty to take up a different attitude from thatwhich we maintained towards all the imperial unions of the last decades. We mustapproach the question in a spirit of cool reflection-not with flying banners and highsounding phrases but in the full knowledge that it is our bounden duty to drive thecapitalists, even against their own wishes, along the predestined path and that it is ourspecial task to ensure that the union shall come about as a union between free andequal peoples and upon no other basis whatsoever.   (Loud cheers.)
