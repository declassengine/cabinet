May, 1917*After consultation with the War Office, I desireto submit for the decision of the War Cabinet a- question &apos;which has-arisen with regard to the administration of theSchedule of Protected Occupations, If130.The question is, to what extent men are liable toimmediate recruitment who have entered munitions worksince- the 7th. May on which date the Schedule becameoperative.   These men may be divided into the followingcategories(l)   Men who v;ere en^a^ed on munitions work before the7th. May and&apos; Have removed 3ince that date toanother firm. -  -(2)   Men not engaged - on munition 3 frork before tho 7th. kaywho&apos; have come; on to it since and are en^a^ed in anoccupation protected under the&apos;Scheculo.(-3)   Men not en&apos;*a^ed-on munitions work before &quot;the 7th.May trho have-come&apos; on to it since and&apos;arc not in aprotected occupation.- The doubt which has arisen relates only to a sectionof...the last relays of men.   No proposal has been made torecruit neither:of -the first&apos;two classes.   With regard to thelast -class,;:.! a-^ree that men--who are under 32 years /
of ago and in. category &quot;A&quot; who are.not in a ScheduledOccupation and have entered munitions work 3ince the7th. May arc liable to immediate recruitment.   But withregard to men over 32 and men in.categories lower.than&quot;A&quot; of military age,  the position is doubtful.paragraph &apos;5 of the Hoteo to the Schedule naysthat *men engaged on Admiralty.. War Office or Munitionswork not passed Category *A* will not for the presentbe recruited ....... unless it is decided that the. Armyrequire the release from such rrork:. of men-in a lowermedical category&quot;...Similarly, paragraph 11 says &quot;&apos;?or the presentit la not -intended .......... to enlist from Admiralty,. WarOffice,, or Munitions work ...... men rvio had attained theage of 32 by January 1st. 1917&quot;.Paragraph 12 says &quot;This Schedule cones into -Operation on the 7th.. May, 19.17&quot;The agreement concluded between the Governmentand the A...S.       on the 4th. Kay&apos; contained-the followingprovision:* -&quot;&apos;.(4)   If the Government at sotie later date,-havingconsulted rath the Trade Unions concerned,decide to withdraw from Admiralty, Jar Office,or munitions work, mtr. of lower medicalcategories than &quot;A&quot;, the--Fill instruct theirofficials to withdraw.male diluted, labour ofthese categories- first.&quot;It is- nowhere stated in tho Schedule that theprotection given by paragraphs 5 and 11 to men on ;agedon Admiralty, War Office or Munitions rork, is limitedto men *ho had entered such *-ork by the date vfcen theSchedule came Into operation,, vis. the 7th- May, and the
following statement occurs in a document called ttA ShortGuide to the Schedule&quot;,, which h/*s been very widely circu-lated&apos;-4.- If my Occupation is not mentioned in the Schedule,where do I- stand ? tIf you arc over the a,^e of 32 or in a lowermedical category than MAM, you will not be calledttjj for military service at present so long as youarc engaged on Adniralty, V&amp;t Office or Munitionswork or&quot;in Railway Workshops.On the other hand, it may be ar.-*ued that it is absurdto suppose that the protection given by the Schedulewas intended to cover men who took up such sork for the-first time after &quot;the date, when the Schedule was broughtinto operation.The preface to the Schedule provides that menengaged on Admiralty, War Office,&apos; or Munitions work whoare not protected, wi11&quot;only be posted for service afterconsultation with the local representative of theGovernment Department concerned. In order to carry outthis provision, it rill be necessary that if the menare to be called up, they should be called up throughthe Munitions Area Recruiting Office at the instance ofthe Munitions - Area Dilut i on Officer.I a^ree with- the War Office that it is desirablethat men of military a^e who have co:ae on to munitionswork for the first time since the ?th. May should becalled up, if the Army needs then, unless they possessthe kind of skill which i* protected by the.Schedule,but-in view of the poesibil/ity of     recurrence ofindustrial unreot -following..the recruitment of such men;l desire &quot;to obtain ths&quot;decision of the War Cabinet beforeaction is taken.(Intld).
