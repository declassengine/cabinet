RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.German Post-War Economic Policy.IV.-STATE CONTROLLED FOREIGN TRADE versus UNRESTRICTEDECONOMIC INTERNATIONALISM.German discussions on Economic Reconstruction are centreing more and moreround the question of the conditions under which foreign trade will be carried onafter the war. It is generally recognised that the re-stocking of the country withfoodstuffs and raw materials will be a task of gigantic difficulty, and also that theParis Conference Policy, should it be carried into effect, will greatly menace manyof Germany&apos;s established trade connections abroad, and necessitate a revision of herwhole foreign trade policy. Under these circumstances opinion is crystallising intotwo camps &apos;. .(1) Those who draw from the Blockade and the Paris Resolutions the moral thatGermany must put her foreign trade frankly on a fighting basis andmake herself as independent as possible of present enemy and neutralcountries, so as to be ready for future wars. This involves the permanentrestriction of imports, the protection of the native forms of productionwhich have grown up during the war, the adoption.of a &quot; big revolver &quot;policy on an unprecedented scale in trade bargaining with foreigncountries and, as a natural accompaniment,&apos; a very large measure ofS3rndication and State control, even to the extent of the establishment ofState monopolies for practically every article of import.(2) Those who, whilst reluctantly admitting the necessity of a continuance ofthe State control of industry during the transition period, view the wholepolicy with suspicion, and are anxious to revert, at the earliest possiblemoment, to unhampered competitive trading on the old lines.The following articles have been selected for translation as affording a usefulcommentary on the trend of opinion in the two camps : , The first (see page 2) appeared in the October 1916 issue of Schmoller&apos;sJahrbiicher, a standard economic periodical edited by Professor Schmoller, theauthoritative patriarch among German economists. It is of interest from manypoints of view: as an attempt at a detailed and constructive reply to the policy ofthe Paris Conference Resolutions, as an illustration of the unshrinking thoroughnesswith which the Germans are prepared to carry through a policy once they haveembarked on it, and as throwing light on the numerous substitute industries andother economic expedients that have been adopted during the war. It will be notedthat the author is in close touch with official circles, and claims to have worked outhis ideas in collaboration with the Departments of State concerned.The second article (see page 22) written by a theorist from the&apos; opposite point -of view, supports its conclusions in an interesting sketch of German economicprogress during the two tariff-periods preceding the war.The third article (see page 24) represents the attitude of the general tradingcommunity towards the official schemes of State control, and develops the argumentby working out its effect in the case of a single commodity-wool..a  (33)3196(2656-3) Wt, 11366-60  100  6/17  E&amp;SAConfidential.Printed for the ITse of th^ Committee.

INTRODUCTORY.In discussions about our future commercial policy it has frequently beenproposed that the State monopolies of&apos; the import of the chief foodstuffs, feeding stuffsand raw materials which have been, established in the course of the war through thecentral purchasing company and the various raw material companies, should beretained either permanently or at any rate during the transition period. The wideissues opened up by this proposal seem to demand a detailed discussion. Thefollowing essay, which owes its origin to the suggestions of official persons in thePrussian departments concerned, is an attempt to meet this need.II. THE AIM OF IMPORT MONOPOLIES.A.-Import Monopolies and the Transition Period.The first task of our commercial policy after the close of hostilities will be to tideover the transition from a state of war to a state of peace. Our empty stores will haveto be replenished without too great an increase in freights and prices and without aserious fall in the exchange. For this purpose it will be necessary (i) to estimate theamount of. cargo space available and the demand for raw materials; (ii) to arrangethe raw materials in order of importance and to distribute them over the availablecargo space. We shall further have to take special precautions against the dangerthat the industries of enemy countries may get into full swing sooner than our own,since those countries control a large part of the world&apos;s production of industrial rawmaterials, and are determined to use their natural resources primarily for their owe.
recuperation. (Compare B 3 of the discussions of the Paris Economic Conference ofJune 14-16, 1916.) Thjs will increase the difficulties of a problem which is in itselfno easy one, and will make inevitable the adoption of compulsory action by the State.We are thus driven to the view, which few will care to contest, that import monopolieswill have to be retained during the transition period.There is, however, still considerable divergence of opinion as to whether some ofthese monopolies should be adopted as permanent arrangements ; opinion is, however,steadily growing in this sense, and the supporters of import monopolies as a permanentfeature in our economic system hope for advantages both commercial and financialfrom their retention.B. German Economic Aims.1. Germany&apos;s Commercial Policy and Future Position in World Industry.It cannot be denied that Germany&apos;s foreign trade prospects have been, unfavour-ably affected by the war. We must face the fact that we shall have to reckon, afterthe close of hostilities, with an economic campaign undertaken by our enemies.Their designs are sufficiently indicated by the resolutions of the Paris EconomicConference of June 14-16, 1916. It is not necessary to believe in the practicabilityof those resolutions in order to recognise that their discussion reveals a condition ofanti-German feeling widely existent in England, France and Russia. From this pointof view it is worth while glancing briefly at the Paris Resolutions, so far as theyconcern the period after the war. The Paris Economic Conference was thoroughlyofficial in character. Representatives of the Governments of France, England,Australia, Canada, Russia, Italy, Japan, Belgium and Portugal, took part in itsdeliberations. It is true that its discussions represent no more than proposals whichstill require confirmation by the countries concerned. The French Cabinet, however,has already given its assent to them, though in several other countries, especially inRussia and Italy, and to a lesser extent in England, India and France, currents ofopposition have become evident. In accordance with the dishonest methods whichcharacterise all the declarations of our enemies, the economic war against Germany isdescribed in the resolutions as an act rendered necessary by &quot; our efforts to establish&quot; our domination over the production and markets of the whole world, and to impose&quot; on other countries an intolerable yoke.&quot; A number of measures are thereforerecommended for the transition period and as permanent measures after the war.Most favoured nation treatment is to be withdrawn from us for a number of years; thenatural supplies of the enemy states are for the present to be reserved exclusively fortheir industries. To prevent the flooding of their markets with German goods, theimport of German goods is to be prohibited for a fixed period. There are otherprovisions similarly designed to thwart our progress. Special regulations are to beapplied to German ships during the same fixed period.. No details are given it istrue as to these special regulations. A formal decision to close the harbours of theAllies to German ships or to levy special dues on German ships was not arrived at.Nor were all the wishes of the extremists fulfilled as regards the exclusion of Germancapital from enemy countries. German subjects are indeed to be prevented frompractising certain trades which affect national defence and economic independence,but the idea that had been mooted in many quarters of forbidding German capital totake part in enemy enterprises and to exclude German citizens from directorships inenemy countries seems to have been abandoned. Nevertheless, we must face the factthat our enemies desire to make themselves independent of German imports as regardsall goods which are important for the normal development of their economic activities,and to adopt such means as preferential tariffs and prohibitions for that purpose. AsMr. Asquith stated in the House of Commons in a speech explaining the Paris Resolu-tions, it is proposed to give State help to the manufacture of zinc and dye-stuffs.Mutual commercial relations between the Allies are to be facilitated by direct andmore rapid sea communication at lower rates and by the extention and improvement ofpostal and telegraph facilities. The Conference, however, abstained from recom-mending a system of mutual preference, such as has frequently been suggested inenemy countries. No agreement was arrived at in this sphere beyond the decision toadopt common action in commercial negotiations with Germany. It was, however,proposed to assimilate the legislation of the various countries as to patents, trademarks, marks of origin, &amp;c, and to adopt a common policy with regard to patents, trademarks and literary and artistic works originating in Germany during the war.a 2
Even if these resolutions turn out to he a gigantic bluff, we shall have to reckonwith a serious decline in our trade with bur present enemies. The general temper ofmind in enemy countries will in itself be quite sufficient to bring this about. Nodoubt Prince Bulow is quite correct when he remarks in the new edition of his bookGerman Policy, pages 11-12): &quot; It is not only: for us Germans that this war is a national&quot; war. It-has become a national war also for the English, for the French and for&quot; important sections of the population of Russia. The national hatreds that have been&quot; fanned by the war and by the bloodshed involved will live on after the war, until it&quot; is succeeded in turn by some passion directed into another channel. Germans must&quot; realize that if the war itself does not create quite new situations (such as indeed we&apos;* can hardly expect), the bitter feeling in France, England and Russia will survive the&quot; war, and will he a factor of vital importance for the character of the peace.&quot; It willalso be of vital importance, one may add, for the shaping of German commercialpolicy after the war.It is no doubt, very unlikely that the feeling against Germany will lead to a closeeconomic union between England, France and Russia, but a British Imperial customsunion is a possibility seriously to he reckoned with. This cannot but have animportant hearing on our foreign trade, since it would affect a territory of 30&apos;4million square kilometres with about four hundred and twenty-six million inhabitants.Even in neutral countries the position of the German merchant will in future hemore difficult than of old. He will have to reckon with the establishment of newindustries in lands where we previously sold our goods; in Central and SouthAmerica we shall meet an increased competition from the United States, in China anincreased competition from Japan. The fact that our commercial relations withoversea countries have for two years past been almost entirely cut off cannot but haveits effect. Moreover, both the United States and J apan have profited greatly out ofwar contracts for the belligerents and have thus become much wealthier and moreformidable competitors.The commercial situation after the war will thus be less favourable than in thepre-war period.   If we are to counteract these adverse influences, and to maintain ourposition in the market of the world, we shall need to strengthen our commercialarmour.   The relations between the State and the economic life of the community willprobably become still&apos; more intimate.   The State will he forced to intervene moreeffectively than hitherto to improve the condition of the people, and especially toincrease our export trade with foreign countries, and it will also be necessary to placeour. economic activity, more completely than in pre-war times, at the service of theState in its efforts to increase its power.   That will not be possible without increasedsacrifice on the part of individuals, and a surrender of the profits of the moment tofuture prospects.   We were only too much inclined before the war to regard therapid increase of riches in the hands of individuals as an unconditional advantage tothe community, and to bestow more attention upon the rapid growth of our wealththan upon safeguarding the foundations of our economic life.   Not a few Germancommercial authorities, for instance, regarded the fostering of our industrial exporttrade as the most important consideration, and advocated a lowering of the duties onfoodstuffs, even at the risk of reducing the productivity of our agriculture andimpairing our ability to live on our own supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials.Such proposals might perhaps be suited to a world without war and conflicts ofpolitical interests and ambitions, but their realisation in a country surrounded bypowerful and envious neighbours, exposed, as this war has proved, to being cut off forseveral years from oversea imports, would have been disastrous.   They over-estimatedpure economic as against political factors and set too little store by considerations ofpolitical and economic independence.   The efforts of the Government to preserve thebalance of forces in our economic life by promoting agricultural production werewidely misunderstood.   It is to.be hoped that the experiences of the war will lead toa .change of feeling on this point.   On the other hand the promotion of home suppliesneed in no way lead to neglect of the interests of our manufacturing export trade.The increase m our national wealth may perhaps be somewhat slackened, but ourgeneral position will be all the safer and less assailable.If we set out from the axiom that our economic policy must be dominated evenmore.than hitherto by the will to power, its general aim must be to secure a morecomplete development of our productive resources, an improvement in our balance oftrade, a greater independence of foreign countries in our economic life, and, side byside with this, a strengthening of our preparations for war.
Amongst tb,ese proposals there is one which meets with serious opposition,namely, the idea that we must secure as large, a. measure as possible of economic self-sufficiency.    To the demand that foreign foodstuffs and other imports must belimited in favour of home products, the reply is frequently made that &quot;a man cannot&quot; sell unless he buys.   Limitation of imports will mean less exports, and Germam&quot; cannot prosper without exports.&quot; Those who argue thus overlook the fact that, takenas a whole, Germany imports more goods thaa she sells.   (In the last full year 1913-an uncommonly favourable year the surplus amounted to 673 million marks, andin the year 1912 to 1,735 million marks).   We paid for these surplus purchases outof the income which we made by lending capital at interest and out of freights, &amp;c.Important as these sources of income are, it still remains true that the export cgoods is the more important entry on the credit side of our balance sheet, and it is,therefore, a matter of regret that our exports are so far behind our imports. Moreover,the objection takes no account of- the fact that the countries in which we buy are, to alarge extent, different from those in which we sell.   This is clear from the fact thatour exports predominate over our imports in our. trade with most of the Europeanstates except Russia, especially so in the case of England, but also as regardsAustria-Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, &amp;c.On the other hand, our imports exceed our exports in our trade with most of theAmerican, Asiatic, African and Australian countries, especially the United States,British India, the Argentine, the Australian Commonwealth, British West Africa,the Dutch Netherlands, Chili, Brazil, Egypt. &amp;c.   From this enumeration it is clearthat it is just the very countries from which we mainly draw our foodstuffs andother imports who are poor customers for our own products, and especially for ourmanufactures.   It is to our European neighbours that our industrial exports moreespecially find their way, that is to say, to countries which are for the most partthemselves highly developed industrially.    Thus we have much less to lose in thecountries which would be chiefly affected by the limitation of our imports of food-stuffs and raw materials than those countries have to lose from us.    The UnitedStates for example were responsible in 1912 for 14&apos;8 per cent, of our imports butonly took 7&apos; 8 per cent, of our exports.   Our. surplus imports in this case amountedto no less than 900 million marks.   Again, our balance of trade as regards theBritish Empire as a whole was an unfavourable one before the war, although Englandalone was our best customer for manufactured goods. . As regards England, ourexports exceeded our imports in 1912 by 318 million marks.   The surplus of exportswas, however, more than wiped out by the surplus of our imports in our intercoursewith the British Colonies, which amounted to 887 million marks.   So that as regardsthe British Empire as a whole our balance of trade was unfavourable to the extentof 569 million marks.   The details are shown on the table on the following page.The year 1913 had to be selected as its basis because in that year, for the first time,the distinction between different groups of imports and exports was worked outaccording to the decisions of the Brussels Conference.Our object then is to make ourselves as far as possible self-sufficient in theeconomic sphere, to develop our productive resources, to improve the balance of ourforeign trade and to thwart the economic plans of our enemies. What steps shouldwe take to secure these objects? In the first place the greatest economy must bepractised in the use of all commodities imported from abroad or manufactured outof imported raw material. Increases in the customs duties on luxury articles orsumptuary taxation in order to reduce consumption are incontrovertible expedients.Efforts like those which are being made to replace foreign by German fashionsdeserve to be supported, and special efforts should be made to replace objects whichare made from foreign materials by substitutes composed of home materials. Therehave been successful examples of this during the war. There must be no questionof giving up the achievements secured in these fields during the war ; they must bemaintained, except in so far as they involve too great a strain upon the purchasingpower of the population. Special progress has been made during the war in theproduction of substitutes for imported cattle fodder, e.g., the use of yeast, straw andsawdust for fodder purposes. The use of important bye-products obtained throughthe disintegration of timber and straw (e.g., spirits of wine and aceton as materialfor explosives and of artificial rubber, benzol, methylated spirit, ammonia andvarious oils) would allow us in time of peace to produce fodder from straw andwood which, mixed with the albuminous yeast fodder, makes a good cheap articleA 3

In this way we would, perhaps, be able tobecome independent of imported oats and Russian barley. Further, we could largelydispense with the use of imported metals. For instance, iron and zinc can be usedto replace copper in electrical installations. It is true that zinc wire is not so goodas copper wire and needs to be used in greater thickness, and that the consequentincrease of weight will necessitate a strengthening of the support poles. Goepel istherefore of opinion that zinc should only be used as a stop gap and not as apermanent substitute, but perhaps it will be possible, at least in domestic installa-tions, to replace copper permanently by zinc In place of brass, iron and zinc arebeing successfully used for scientific instruments. Besides these two metals-aluminium is also available as a substitute for copper, so far as this metal which hashitherto been procured out of imported ores (bauxit and kryolite) can be securedfrom home supplies. Our technical experts have also enabled us to overcomeour deficiency of manganese. Nettles are recommended in many quarters as asubstitute for cotton and jute. Other substitutes for jute, such as textilose,still remain to be tested. Substitutes for guncotton are now also being successfullyused. Rubber too has been replaced, partly by substitutes, partly by artificialproduction. The great achievement of extracting nitrogen and similar gasesfrom the air to replace Chilian saltpetre must not be forgotten. Finallythere are numerous substitutes for articles of food, such as coffee and tea. Allthese efforts need support from the State after the war. This can be mostusefully carried through in departments where the State itself is the largestconsumer, as in the use of copper for army, postal and railway purposes. Allarrangements for State contracts would have to be carefully revised with this inview. All State-supported scientific institutes, such as the Imperial Instituteof Technical Physics,- technical high schools and mining academies, wouldhave to make further experiments in these directions. Certain alterations in thecustoms&apos; duties would also have to be Undertaken. The industries for manu-facturing substitutes would need special protection, either by customs&apos; duties orby means of prices fixed by monopoly import companies. In addition to thesubstitute industries the use of old materials and wastes must be considered.   This
question has already assumed a considerable development in Germany, but it can becarried a good deal farther. It cannot be forgotten that it was not until the war thatthe leavings from domestic consumption were collected from private kitchens to beused as cattle fodder. Then there is the further question, which still awaits solution,of collecting the fat out of sewage that has flown off. Ballod has calculated that 1 * 3million marks are lost annually through insufficient use of liquid manure and ofanimal and human excrement.Such demand as is left over after consumption has been reduced we mustendeavour to replace by home production. It will be advisable, for instance, tocontinue the development of the production of flax and other oil-bearing plants(poppies, sunflowers) which has been begun during the war, and also to increaseour supply of poultry, so as to enable us to dispense with the import of Russian eggs.The soil necessary for these new forms of cultivation can be secured in two ways.Firstly, by an increased cultivation of waste lands, which (with the exception of certainnatural reserves maintained in the interests of science and natural beauty) can begradually brought completely under cultivation, partly through a permanent reductionof products of which we produced a surplus before the war. A country in the positionof Germany ought not to produce agricultural products on. so large a scale as weproduced rye and sugar before the war. Wherever such products cannot be used asa substitute for others in the home market (molasses, for instance, in the productionof yeast and fodder substitutes), or where the soil is not unusually suitable for theprevious form of cultivation, it will be wiser to use it for products in which we aredeficient. In any case the export of sugar, which mainly went to England to be usedfor making jam, would seem likely to be endangered. But further, not only an increaseof the area of cultivation, but also an increase of the productivity per nectar, wouldseem to be attainable as a result of intensive plant selection, better manuring, thegeneral use of steam ploughs, draining, &amp;c. It is true that Schulte im Hofe onlyestimates for an increase of 30 per cent, in our productivity per hectar in 1933, andarrives at the conclusien that our production in bread stuffs and fodder will be less by638,000 hectares Compared with 1909-13, in proportion to the increase in the popu-lation. Ballod, however, maintains (and his opinion is confirmed by the investigationsof Heinrich) that our German net harvest of 16 million tons in 1911-13 can be raisedto 32&apos; 2 million tons, and that Germany can maintain a total population of 102 millionpeople.We import a number of: materials in a manufactured form which we could manu-facture ourselves. An example of this is American electrolytic copper, in so far as thisis manufactured out of South American ores. Even our own ores from the Otavimines in south-west Africa used before the war to be sent to the United States to besmelted. If it pays the Americans to send these ores to the New England coast tosmelt, it would pay us to do so on our North Sea coast. Our great demand forcopper would enable us to build works on a scale great enough to compete with thoseof America.In addition to our home production we should lend our support to Allied countrieswith whom we have militarily secure communications,&apos;^&quot; i.e., to Austria-Hungary, Bulgariaand Turkey, so far as our help is desired, and we can do so without interfering withtheir domestic concerns. There are very great agricultural possibilities in Austria,and especially in Hungary. The production of wheat per acre in Austria in 1911-13was 13*87, and in Hungary 13 &quot;40, little more than half the German average of 22*27.Ballod considers it technically possible to double the agricultural production of Austria,and the outlook is still more promising in Hungary. Esslen finds particular fault withthe rotation of crops, the bad use made of stable dung, and the insufficient applicationof artificial manure; the large estates and the distances between the villages havegreatly increased the cost of agricultural production, owing to the time and labour spentby man and beast in travelling to and from work. Both Esslen and the Hungarianstatesman Szterenyi are therefore demanding land reform on a large scale. There isalso room for an improvement in education in-general, and of agricultural education inparticular. These are problems which only Hungarians themselves can solve. Never-theless, Germany can aid the development of Hungarian agriculture by the supply of* There will be no necessity always to use the land-route in time of peace. For goods, e.g,, from theBagdad district, the sea-route via the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal will be cheaper, whenthe railway runs down to the Gulf.a 4
capital and by assuring it a new and valuable market. This aim can be attained bothby means of the customs alliance which has been so much discussed, by a low systemof interior customs&apos; duties for Hungarian agricultural produce, and by import monopolies.Since the improvement in Hungarian production must be a matter of gradual growth,there can be no question of a dangerous competition with our own agriculture.Agriculture and mining are also capable of great development in Bulgaria and jTurkey. We have lately been warned from many quarters not to indulge in exaggeratedhopes as to the increase of our commercial relations with those qpuntries, and, so faras quick returns are concerned, these warnings are not without justification. Decadeswill probably pass before Bulgaria and Turkey can play an important part as sourcesof supply for our materials and as markets for our manufactured goods. Great reformswill have to be undertaken in Turkey in the land laws, in public health (e.g., in corn-bating syphilis), in public safety (e.g., against brigandage), before her economic lifecan really develop on a large scale. In particular there will have to be an increasein her population, possibly by the settlement of Turkish tribes from the RussianEmpire. All this must be a matter of time. We must also, of course, be very carefulto avoid anything leading to the suspicion that we regard these countries as areas ofexploitation. Junge is perfectly right when he says that in all our economic dealingswith Turkey we must be careful to behave as though we were Turks ourselves.Finally, inestimating the possibilities of these countries as sources of raw material,we must remember that they desire to develop industries of their own, and that thiswill absorb a portion of their raw supplies. This applies, for instance, to the Turkishproduction of wool and cotton. Nevertheless, Junge estimates that we can draw con-siderable supplies from Turkey, including wool, cotton, oil of every kind, silk, eggs,vegetables, dried fruits of every kind, valonea for tanning, leather, medicinal herbs,oils for perfumes, tobacco, chrome, cotton, emery, and borax. On the other hand,according to Junge we cannot for a long time expect any considerable import ofgrain. An article not specially mentioned by Junge, but&apos;which is important from ourpoint of view, is mineral oil; there are important wells of this in the neighbourhood ofthe Bagdad railway. From Bulgaria we may expect an import of wheat, barley, maize,nuts, olives, hemp, silkworm cocoons, vegetables, fruit, attar of roses, bacon, fat,eggs, poultry, hides and skins, copper, &amp;c, into Germany. How greatly the agricultureof Bulgaria can be extended is clear from the fact that, according to Dix, in 19U825 per cent, of the soil was still pasture land, and that Bulgaria only harvested1,218,000 tons of wheat from 11,681 square kilometres in cultivation, while Austriaproduced 1,895,000 tons from 12,603 square kilometres, and Germany -1,360,000 from19,257 square kilometres.The development of Bulgaria and Turkey as of Austria-Hungary is in the firstplace of course a matter for those countries themselves, but Germany can help herealso by providing experts, capital and an assured market. Moreover, communicationsbetween Germany and the Balkan Peninsula can be greatly improved by canals fromthe Danube to the Neckar, the Main, the Werra, the Elbe, the Oder and the Vistula,and by the improvement of the conditions of navigation at the Iron Gates.i Finally the development of the productive resources of our own colonies must beconsidered. Of course no amount of colonial production can improve our economicpreparation for war until we have a fleet equal to that of England or until, perhaps bya reincorporation of Egypt in the Turkish Empire, we are in control of a secure land-route to Africa. Nor can we for the moment say whether, pending the fulfilment ofthese two conditions, the commercial submarine can be developed to such a point as toafford a secure means of communication with our colonies in time of war. Neverthe-less the prosperity of our colonial agricultural and mining industry would considerablyimprove our commercial position as against foreign producers of raw material and istherefore desirable for its own sake. Further discussion on this point is not worthwhile at the present moment since we do hot yet know what our colonial empire willlook like after the war.In spite of all these measures, we shall still, to a certain extent, be dependent uponraw materials from hostile or neutral states. In so far as this is so, we must endeavourto play off the various producing countries against one another and to oppose to theutmost of our power the dominating position which certain countries possess inimportant articles of world trade. Further, we must use every effort to free&apos; ourselvesentirely in our foreign trade from dependence upon England, e.g., as regards bills ofexchange upon London; again, to take only one instance, we import a number of
articles from the Dutch &quot;East Indies via Singapore and Penang which we could perfectlywell import direct.     &apos;In the case of articles which we and our allies do not produce in sufficient quantityand as to which we are therefore wholly or partly dependent on oversea import, itwould be desirable always to keep sufficient stores in the country to enable us to wagea war of several years&apos; duration whilst cut off completely from the outer world. Thedrying of potatoes will enable us to store our great potato production. The import-ance of storage has hitherto not been sufficiently recognised. Indeed many of themeasures of our commercial policy seem to have been devoted to the object of keepingour stores as low as possible. This is certainly true of the corn market and ofmeasures like the abolition of freedom from interest for warehouse credits, as also of thesystem of certificates of import.&apos;5&apos; The danger of the system of certificates of import intime of political complication and imminence of war was repeatedly pointed out beforethe war. The official report published on the subject in 1910 attached no decisiveimportance, however, to these anxieties. It stated that there were so many differentpossibilities of supplementing German home production by foreign imports that therecould be no question of districts which catered specially for the export trade not beingable to make up for a possible resulting deficiency. The experience of the war hasshown us that these assumptions were too optimistic. In defence of the importcertificate system it is sometimes alleged that it has been extraordinarily useful in thedevelopment of agricultural cultivation. This is, however, only true of rye and oats,whereas the cultivation of wheat seems rather to have been damaged by it. Certifi-cates of import have therefore increased the production of those kinds of grain ofwhich we produce up to or above our home demand, whereas it has hindered theproduction of the varieties in which our deficiency is greatest. This is certainly anundesirable result. If the system is to be abandoned it would be necessary tocompensate East German agriculture by the reintroduction of the graduated tariff.Moreover, it would be worth considering whether it would not be desirable to continuethe Rhine, Hanover canal to the Elbe and so to provide an easy means of access forEast German corn to the West. The fear that this canal might serve as a gate ofentrance for oversea corn would be allayed by the introduction of a corn importmonopoly.In addition to the import and storage policy advocated above, we shall need toadopt a decisive export policy. It has already been mentioned that it is just thosecountries from which we derive our foodstuffs and raw materials that are some ofour poorest customers for manufactured goods. An endeavour must be made toincrease our exports to these countries and thus to balance our imports. In this waywe should be able to make up for the losses we shall doubtless suffer in enemycountries.2. Import Monopolies as a means for the attainment of these Commercial Aims.One of the most practical means of achieving the aims just set forth is by theproposed system of import monopolies. They would at once facilitate storage and protectsubstitute industries from hostile competition. They would also enable us to makefar more effective use than hitherto as a commercial weapon of the purchasing powerof our people, which, however closely we may approach to the ideal of self-sufficiency,must always remain very considerable. The importance of Germany as a consumer isclear from the fact that, according to the statistical annual of the German Empire for1915 (pages 66-67), Germany&apos;s imports of a number of raw materials aod foodstuffsexceed those of all other countries, e.g., in the case of iron ores, copper, skins and hides,barley, fruit and eggs. In numerous other articles Germany occupies the secondplace, e.g., in cotton, wool, timber for building and other uses, mineral oils, flour, coffeeand tobacco. In other articles it occupies in the third place, e.g., in wheat, maize, rice,rubber, silk and tin. It is worth noting that Germany&apos;s position may possibly beeven more favourable than these figures reveal; e.g., in the case of wheat, the importinto the Netherlands which, on the figures, exceeds that into Germany, consists mainlyof wheat destined for Germany. It is only England which is a bigger purchaser thanGermany. The threat of our withdrawal, of custom, can therefore be used as a meansfor promoting our export trade.  We would be in a position to demand from the* This refers to an arrangement in successive German tariffs by which an exporter of German-growngrain receives a certificate entitling him to import an equivalent amount free of duty. Under the tariff of1902, which is still in force, the import certificate may be extended by a Bundesrat order, to othercommodities besides grain, and it has been so extended to coffee, petroleum, rice and other articles.Translators Note.a 3196 B
countries from whom ,we procure our raw materials that they should commit theni-selves in return to taking a given quantity of German manufactured goods. Thesemeasures would be all the more effective if Austria-Hungary introduced similarimport monopolies and the two states acted together.&quot;::\The value of import monopolies as an instrument of commercial policy would heconsiderably increased if they were associated with certain other measures, i.e., anembargo on the export of goods in which Germany has a monopoly and of Germancapital to countries upon which we wish to exercise pressure. The principal articlesin which Germany is in a strong position as vendor are potash, coals and chemicals,especially dyestuffs. In the case of potash the nationalisation of the deposits is wellworth considering. If this expedient is not adopted the State could associate itselfwith the potash syndicate and arrange that no sales should be made to boycottedcountries and that a clause should be inserted in contracts with firms resident in othercountries prohibiting sales to boycotted countries. In order to prevent these measuresfrom being thwarted by outside firms the syndicate would have to be given compulsorypowers. The same procedure should be adopted with the colliery syndicates and inthe chemical industry. .Still more important is the veto on the export of German capital to boycottedcountries. That a measure of this kind is a necessary completion of the system ofimport monopolies is shown by the example of the coffee valorisation scheme in Brazil,where the government, supported by the German banking houses, forced up the priceof coffee by buying it up and holding it back from the market. The introduction ofan import monopoly for coffee would necessitate a cessation of practices of this kind ;for it&apos; would be ridiculous to attempt to force Brazil to an agreement by limiting thedemand for coffee and at the same time to assist her to diminish the supply of coffeeand thus to restore the balance between demand and supply.Another argument for the State control of stock exchange prospectuses is that afterthe war we shall need such capital as is over after the re-establishment of our ownindustries for investment in allied countries. It would seem desirable, therefore, toestablish a central body without the permission of which no applications for freshcapital could be issued.(a) The Advantages of Import Monopolies over other Instruments of CommercialPolicy.Import monopolies are not the only means by which the commercial objectsoutlined above can be attained, but they are by far the most effective means. Thesystem of storage might be established by means of subventions to traders. Substituteindustries might be safeguarded by customs duties. But monopolies have greatadvantages over either of these methods, and more particularly over customs duties.Our present tariff, which places a number of raw materials on the free list, gives us nosufficient leverage against the countries upon whom we are specially dependent forthem. Nor would any alteration in the tariff meet the case. A tariff is somethingmuch stiffer and more inelastic than the purchasing arrangements of a monopolycompany, which can be far more easily adapted to the commercial and politicalsituation. A commercial treaty with a foreign state fixes the rate at which our exportswill have to pay, but gives us no assurance of being able to dispose of a given amountof them. Yet it is far more important for us to know how much we can dispose ofthan what duties we shall have to pay.: : Monopolies would also provide us with the possibility of giving a preference tostates like Turkey and Bulgaria, without coming into conflict with the most favourednation clause.(b) The possibility of replacing Foreign by German Goods. ,,       :One objection brought against import monopolies is that foreign countries could, ata pinch, dispense with German manufactures, whereas Germany could not dispense withforeign foodstuffs and raw materials.   Can this objection be sustained ?   Enquiry* By withdrawing our custom we could exercise direct pressure upon the producers of the goodswhich we previously purchased. In the case of agricultural cultivators, for instance, we could demandthat they should import their machinery from Germany. Similar means could be adopted in the case offoreign export firms who are either importers themselves or have relations with importers. Indii ectly we couldbring pressure to bear on the state or community to which the producer concerned belonged. We couldendeavour to secure state or communal orders. These are just a few examples of how the idea adumbratedin the text can be carried through in practice.
would show that the position differs considerably in individual cases. There are manyarticles which we can procure from several different countries, thus enabling us toplay off one against another. The prospects for the establishment of an importmonopoly are most favourable of all in the case of articles in which our own productionis very considerable, in which no foreign state has a monopoly, and in which we caneasily cover our deficiency from neighbouring and friendly states. Wheat is a casein point. The difficulties are also not insuperable in the case of articles in which onestate has for the present a dominating position in world production, but in which theproduction frequently exceeds the demand. Coffee is an example under this head.The difficulties are more serious where this dominating position in world productionis associated with a deficiency in production as compared with demand, as is the casewith cotton. But even here means can be found gradually to reduce the superiorityof the dominating country, and to bring about a decline in consumption by the use ofsubstitutes. Such plans are undeniably attended with serious difficulties ; but theyare not insuperable, and that the government does not so regard them is shown by therecent proposal for a monopoly of oil used for lighting purposes.A word must be said about the speech of M. Clementel, the French Minister ofCommerce and chairman of the Paris Economic Conference. He founded his hopesof victory on the supposed control by our enemies of a number of important rawmaterials. He referred to the fact that the allies control the entire production ofnickel, platinum, and bauxite, and 84 per cent., of that of manganese; that theyproduced 4  times as much hemp, 11 times as much wool, 8 times as much silk astheir enemies ; that they controlled the whole jute production and four-fifths of the flaxproduction of the world.Not one of these so-called monopolies is equal in importance to the Americanmonopoly of cotton and copper. If we really had occasion to fear an embargo on rawmaterials, we should have much more to fear from the United States than from ourpresent enemies. So far as the various articles mentioned by the French Minister ofCommerce are concerned, nickel is chiefly produced in the French island of NewCaledonia and in Canada. Before the war, Germany only satisfied one-eighteenth of herdemand from home sources, and neither the Balkan Peninsula nor Turkey possessdeposits of nickel ore. Our imported nickel, however, comes mainly from the UnitedStates, whither the Canadian and New Caledonian supplies go to be smelted, andwhence they, are exported together with a small American supply secured from theAmerican copper mines. Platinum is found in Columbia as well as in Russia.Bauxite, the raw material for aluminium, is found, not only in France, but in greatquantities in the United States, and also in Dalmatia and Transylvania : manganese notonly in Russia and India, but also in Brazil, while important deposits in Serbia,Bulgaria an d Turkey, are only awaiting foreign capital to be opened up. Wolfram,which M. Clementel did not mention, but in which our production before the war onlycovered one-twenty-fourth of the demand, is found not only in Australia, British FurtherIndia and Portugal, but also in Spain, Argentine and Brazil. Wool we import, notonly from South Africa and Australia, but also from Ihe La Plata States, and in a fewdecades we shall probably also procure it from Asiatic Turkey. In flax we can extendour own domestic cultivation, whilst, if Courland falls to us at the peace, we shallprocure large supplies from there. Silk we, shall be in a position to import fromBulgaria and Turkey. As for jute, which is an Indian climatic monopoly, it canperhaps, as already remarked, be replaced by nettles. It is clear therefore that weneed not be over much alarmed by the assertions of M. Clementel. The table onpage 12 gives a survey of our most important imports together with particulars as tohow large a proportion in each case is derived from enemy countries. The figures relateto the year 1913 and are in millions of marks. In the case of many articles in whichthe import from foreign countries predominates, the facts do not fully bear out thefigures, e.g., we could greatly increase our production of copra.   .&apos;In considering the question of our dependence upon a country from which wedraw raw materials, the mistake is often made of treating the country in question asa single unit and forgetting that there are often great conflicts of interest betweendifferent groups of producers within one and the same country, and that such conflictscan be made use of for our own purpose. It was upon conflicts of interest of thiskind that the Imperial Government hoped to build up the monopoly of lighting oil.There is a tendency to assume that the producing interests in a foreign country havealready formed an all-embracing organisation. No regard is paid to the fact thatattempts to form such organisations are generally faced with insuperable difficulties.B 2

We will now examine how far our ownmarket and our own goods are indispensable to foreign countries. The importanceof the German market for the more important foreign states is clear from theaccompanying table (see page 13). The countries are arranged according to theabsolute values of their German imports. The second column shows the combinedshare of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the trade of the country in question.From these figures it can be seen how much foreign states would suffer throughthe loss of their total trade with German or with the Central Powers. Excludingfrom consideration the neighbouring small or medium-sized states (Holland, Belgium,Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries) and our ally, Austria-Hungary, it is clearfrom the table that we are in a position to exercise the strongest pressure on Russiaand a pressure only less strong upon Chili, the United States, Brazil, Italy, &amp;c.Since there is no question of the cessation of the total German trade of thecountries in question, but only of the cessation of the import of commodities in whichthere will be monopolies, we ought, strictly speaking, to work out the percentage ofGerman to total export trade in monopolised articles from the countries in question.As&apos;this, however, would require very elaborate calculations, we must content ourselveswith1 fthe.example of the United States and Russia. If the United States ceased toexplort&apos;toGermany every article which might conceivably be monopolised (see pp.16-17 below) this would affect about 22 per cent, of the total export trade of thearticles in question and more than 10 per cent, of the total export trade of theUnite&apos;d-^t^t^sP^TMcase is still stronger as regards Russia.

Austrian, especially as the British, colonies would seriously compete in the UnitedKingdom with the imports from Russia. Russia is not nearly so important a marketfor German exports as Germany is for Russian exports. This is clear from, the factthat according to Zuckermann, Russia in no case takes more than 29 per cent, (asagainst Germany&apos;s 89 per cent.) of the total export of any German. article. Thepercentages are as follows.: 28&quot;7 per cent, for machinery, 25&apos;2 per cent, for leather,18&apos;7 per cent, for live animals and animal products, 13 per.cent, for electricalproducts, 12&apos; 8 per cent, for copper and copper alloys, 12*1 per cent., for agriculturalproducts, 11 per cent, for chemicals, &amp;c. As regards Italy, even M. Clementel cannotconceal from himself that his Italian friends would fall into great difficulties if theylost the German market for their perishable early vegetables and fruit, and hetherefore tried to console himself with the thought that the blockade would compelGermany to open her gates as wide as possible to foodstuffs from every quarter.But it is not only as buyers but also as sellers that foreign countries will find ushard to replace. We have monopolies in the shape of potash and chemicals, andmore especially of dyestuffs, and in many markets also coal. Thus, as already stated,we are in a position to bring pressure to bear upon foreign countries.Share of Germany and the Central Powers in the Foreign Trade of certainForeign Countries in Percentages.Country.

They may well, however, raise thefurther objection that the purchasing power of England is many times greater thanour own, and that therefore if England were to adopt import monopolies herself, shecould bring more pressure to bear than ourselves upon neutral states, e.g., America, andthus alter the conditions of the world&apos;s export trade to our disadvantage. But thisargument is not entirely borne out by the facts : e,g.. the case of coffee the purchasingpower of England compared with that of Germany is infinitesimal. It is clear thatwe must only introduce monopolies in articles in which we have the upper hand.We can be sure in any case that no measures of ours wiU have any influence onEnglish policy. If PJnglish statesmen consider the establishment of import monopoliesb 3
possible and desirable they will establish them, whether we have already done so ornot. The idea that by failing to use our strongest commercial weapon we could prevailupon our enemies to follow the same example will soon turn out to be an illusion.(e) Counter Measures by Sellers of Haw Materials against Import Monopolies.But reprisals are feared not only from England but from all the countries fromwhich we derive raw materials, and it is anticipated that counter organisations will beset up against ours. The example of Roumania is frequently cited in this connectionbecause Roumania established a selling organisation to counteract our central pur-chasing company. But no war time example can be considered convincing. TheBrazilian coffee valorisation scheme affords evidence, however, that producing interestscan sometimes organise themselves even without the stimulus of a German importmonopoly. Elsewhere too trusts of producers have been formed without governmentaid, as in the American copper market. It is true that in this instance there are anumber of separate groups operating, but they generally combine for a common policyon the question of prices. Import monopolies would offer an effective protectionagainst a selling organisation of this kind formed independently of German actionand designed for the spoliation of German consumers. Where organisations of thiskind do not already exist foreign countries would first have to call them into existence.That, however, is by no means so easy a task as is imagined, and other forms ofreprisals are equally difficult. Imagine for example that Germany had established animport monopoly in wheat and threatened to cease buying wheat in the Argentine.The Argentine would be faced with the problem as to whether it could respond withreprisals. It would immediately be compelled to realise that reprisals would notmerely interrupt her trade with Germany but also that with other foreign countries.An embargo on exports cannot be applied against one single country since it caneasily be evaded through a third country. Such an embargo would have to be general,and exports to any other country than Germany would require to be licensed, proofsbeing demanded that they were not destined for Germany. Such a measure wouldinvolve the Argentine in a conflict with every other country and would also inflictserious injury upon her own trade an injury perhaps greater than that inflicted bythe German import monopoly itself. The same holds good in the case of export dutiesor of the establishment of an organisation of producers and exporters to watch overexports. In every case the exporting country will have to face the question whetherthe possible injury to its own trade with a single country is of sufficient importance tomake it desirable to submit the whole of its foreign trade with other countries togovernment supervision.   This question will often be answered in the negative.But even supposing Argentine had overcome all these difficulties Germany wouldstill be able to import her wheat from the United States, not to mention Russia andRoumania. The combination of Argentine and United States interests against Germanyseems hardly a possibility to be reckoned with. v(f) Import Monopolies and Commercial Treaties.The final objection brought against import monopolies as a weapon of commercialpolicy is the supposed incompatibility of monopolies with the policy of commercialtreaties and the system of most favoured nation treatment. Past commercial treatiescannot be adduced as a serious obstacle since they have in part been cancelled by thewar and can in part be terminated at the end of 1917. But anxiety is expressed thatimport monopolies will make it impossible to make new treaties. It is clear that inthe case of articles for which import monopoly companies have been formed the exactfixing of the customs&apos; rate is of little importance. The battle will not turn as hithertoupon the tariff itself but upon the question whether Germany is justified in introducingmonopolies. The foreign states from which we derive our raw materials mightplead that the monopolisation of numerous imports had led to complete uncertaintyas to market possibilities in Germany and therefore considerably diminished theadvantages to be derived by a commercial treaty with Germany. It is true that underthese conditions economic conflicts might easily arise. But we have to reckon withthe fact that in any case the re-establishment of commercial relations with our enemieswill not be an easy matter. We have already seen that the Paris Conference hasresolved to deprive us of. most favoured nation treatment for .a number of years.Germany would find monopolies an effective means of defence f against onslaughts of
this kind. In the case of friendly States, e.g,, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey,who could only stand to gain by our monopoly policy, an agreement would certainlybe reached. Neutral states can be divided into two groups: those who are onlyslightly affected by our monopolies of foodstuffs and raw materials (e.g., Denmark asregards its principal imports into Germany, cream, horses, cows, meat and fish), andsecondly, those who are greatly affected by them. The most important of thesestates, America, has, however, never allowed us unconditional most favoured nationtreatment, and it is precisely in our relations with America that the absence of a sharpcommercial weapon has often shown itself to be a disadvantage. If we use ourweapons skilfully we need not fear that the United States will be drawn nearer toEngland than hitherto.C-Financial Aims.1. The necessity of Monopolies as a means of Revenue and the advantages ofImport Monopolies over other Monopolies.Import monopolies would not only prove a new commercial weapon, but also avaluable source of income. The financial deficit of the Empire will be so large afterthe war as to make it impossible to meet it out of taxes and customs duties alone.Julius Wolf calculated in June 1916 that if the war went on for two and a half yearsthe extra amount to be raised annually would be seven thousand million marks. Thiswould amount to one hundred marks per head of the population, whereas the entireburden of taxation for the Empire, the individual states and communes, amountedbefore the war to seventy marks per head. The significance of this figure is increasedwhen it is compared with the national income and national capital of the Germanpeople as a whole before the war. Up to the end of August 1916 the amount ofmoney raised in war loan amounted to 36&apos;5 thousand million marks. Since,according to Heifferich, the total capital of the German nation amounted to somethingover three hundred thousand million marks, it follows that by August 1916 we hadalready invested in the war loan over one-tenth of our total national capital. Our totalnational income amounts to forty thousand millions. Thus the contributions necessaryto make up the annual deficiency would be 18 per cent, of this income and wouldamount to nearly three-fourths of our annual increase of capital, which, according toHeifferich, was ten thousand million marks in the last year of peaee.* These figuresprove that we shall be forced to undertake the establishment of monopolies.In the literature dealing with financial reform after the war, a number ofproposals have already been made for monopolies. Suggestions have been made inconnexion with the coal trade, the making of coal gas, potash, cigarettes, electricity,nitrogen, insurance, as well as for the nationalisation of water power. It is urged thatthe monopoly of certain forms of production might be associated with great technicalimprovements. In the case of coal, its transformation into gas would enable acompleter use to be made of its heating powers, which are still to a large extentwasted. In potash mines and in the cement industry a stop could be put to theunprofitable investment of capital. In both these industries it is declared that thecapacity of the works already existing considerably exceeds the demand, and yet newcapital is constantly being invested. Since the works can make use only of a portion oftheir productive capacity, the costs are too expensive. If a part of the works were closedand the remainder worked at its utmost capacity the cost of production could bereduced to the benefit of the State. Those who advocate such plans do not contem-plate direct government management but rather a composite semi-commercial form ofadministration in which the State would play the part, not of director but ofsuperintendent. These ideas are a revival of proposals put forward by Schmoller in1905 in his lecture on the relation between the cartels and the State. The suggestionthen made was that limited companies with seventy-five or more million marks shareor debenture capital should be forced to surrender a quarter of their superintendenceand directorship to experts appointed by the Imperial Chancellor and the governmentin order to associate the political and economic interests of the Empire and the State* It should be expressly noted that these figures give no occasion for any great anxiety. According toHeifferich, 6ermany&apos;s national capital taken absolutely was greater than that of France and England andthe G erman national income greater than that of France and equal to that of England. Calculated per headof the population our national income was greater than that of France, though less than that of England, andour capital, reckoned per head of the population, was well behind that of both enemy countries, but since thecost of the war in England and France is probably greater than with us, the comparison does not fall out toour disadvantage.B 4
Government with the interests of the company. These companies were to pay over to tthe. Empire &quot;and the State Government a half of their total profits above 10 per cent.It is outside-the scope of this article to discuss^ any such plans in detail.   We   Imust confine ourselves liere to monopolies of imported raw materials.   Monopolies of 1-this-kind &quot;enjoy a number Of advantages over other forms of monopoly.   Othermonopolies would demand large capital investments which would not be needed forimport monopolies, provided that they were established as semi-commercial under- jtakings on the lines just suggested.   Capital investment by the State would only&quot;be required in so far as it was necessary to secure that the State had sufficientinfluence over the policy of the companies.A further advantage of import monopolies is that that would not, as- in the case ofthe tobacco monopoly, destroy a number of middle-class businesses. They would leavethe whole home trade undisturbed and would affect the operations of only a compara-tively small number of large firms.2.   The Profits to be derived from the lowering of Purchase Prices.Import monopolies would lead to gains in two ways. Firstly, they wouldconcentrate the whole German demand in a single hand and thus would tend to reducepurchase prices in foreign countries. Secondly, they could be used in many cases for awholly unobjectionable raising of selling prices. In order to make clear how much isto be gained by a reduction of purchase prices let us consider the import figures forarticles in which a monopoly might perhaps be considered desirable.Million Marks.Cotton and cotton refuse    ----- 569Barley    &apos; -        -        - - -, - 390Sheeps&apos;wool        -        - - - -. - 362Wheat       -        -&apos;&apos;      - - - - - 330Copper      -        -        - - - - 330Ox and calf hides   -         - - - - - 313Pinewrood and other timber - - - - 270Coffee.(raw)-               &apos; -      . - -. - - 219Iron ores    -         -         - - - - - 219Bran and&apos;rice refuse         - - - - - 149Raw silk    -        -        - - - -    -   - 152Tobacco in leaf      -         - - - - - 134Linseed     -        -&apos;      ..&apos;- - 129Copra        -         -         - - - 122Rubber, gutta-percha and balata - - - - - 120Natural oil and mineral oil - - - - - 107&apos; Palm kernels         -        - - - - . 104Maize        -        -        - - - - - 102- Jute          -  &apos;     - - - - - 90Oilcake    -. .     -..&apos;.     - - - - - 80Tin ores and tin     -         - - - -    v     - 77Cocoa                   r         - - - - - 67Rice   &quot;     -        -        - - v - - 60Flax and flax tow             - - - - 50Lead ores and lead - ..      - - - - 49Cotton seed and cotton-seed oil   . - - - - 48Sesame      -                  - - - - 44Hemp and hemp tow         - - . - - - 38Rape seed   -        -   ;    - - ... - - 37Leguminous plants - ..-;: - 30Manganese ores&apos;     -     .  - -   1     - : ;- 28Peanuts     - - - - - 28Sulphur     -        -        -     ,. - - &apos; &apos;;- - 25Wolfram ore..... -. - -- -- 11Tea - . ;    - ,        -     - - - -      - -    .    - 8Total . -   4,891** Saltpetre has &apos;been left out of this enumeration, since we can reckon on its replacement by homeproducts.
Let us assume that these articles can be bought 10 per cent, cheaper. This wouldmean a gain of about 500 million marks. Something must be deducted to allow forthe fact that the consumption of foreign goods would be reduced by the use of substi-tutes (e.f/., in the case of barley and rubber) or through the raising of the selling price(e.g., in the case of coffee and tea). But on the other hand consumption would increasewith the growth of population, as well as by the fact that in the case of many articles(e.g., coffee and cotton) greater economies in purchasing could perhaps be practised.The possibility of effecting economies in purchasing can be verified in the case ofour chief article of import, cotton. In the most important area of production, theUnited States, the wholesale prices which we paid before the war were considerablyabove the cost of production and this itself as a result of the unscientific cultivationof the Americans was far higher than it need have been. The Lancashire PrivateCotton Investigation Commission, a body of experts which investigated the conditionsof cotton production in the United States, came to the conclusion that the average costof cotton production in the United States in 1904 could be reduced by one-half, or fromnine cents per English pound of cotton to 4^- cents. In the volume by Burkett andPoe translated into German by Heine under the title of &quot; Cotton &quot; (1908), attention isdrawn to faulty methods of soil cultivation and an average cost of 7&apos;9 cents arrived at,and the authors conclude that a price of 10 cents per English pound is justifiable.In fact, however, the price in New York in 1913 averaged 12&apos; 78 cents and rose onthe 30th September to 14&apos; 20 cents, i.e., it was too high by two to three cents per Englishpound, or 18&apos;5 to 27 &quot;7 pfennigs per kilogram. A saving of 20 pfennigs perkilogram on the import of 1913 would have brought us in an annual incomeof 96 million marks.That important economies can be effected by a rational cultivation of the soil andthe ehmination of the middleman has often been stated at the International CottonCongress. A proposal for direct intercourse between planter and spinner was firstmade in 1914 at Zurich by an Englishman, Tattersall. At later meetings severalAmericans spoke in the same sense, Terrill in Paris in 1908, Hightower at Barcelonain 1911 and Harvie Jordan, President of the Southern Cotton Association, the mostimportant cotton planters&apos; association in the United States, at Scheveningen in 1913.The idea is therefore not merely academic but originated in business circles.Against the suggestion that monopoly companies would buy more cheaply anumber of objections have been urged. Fears are expressed that foreign sellers wouldbe in a position to estimate beforehand the amount of the German company&apos;s demand,and that this would make it possible for them to raise their prices to the highest point.In reply it may be said that the Americans could not possibly ascertain what supplieswere stored in Germany so as to cover the needs of our industry at any particularemergency. The amount kept in storage would of course be kept absolutely secret.If it were feared that the statistics of import, export, and re-export would lead toestimates of the amount in storage, the publication of these statistics could betemporarily suspended, as has been done in certain instances during the war.Statistics are not an end in themselves but only an instrument of state administration.Another argument against import monopolies is the alleged perfection at whichour commercial organisation has arrived in process of development. Commissionbusiness is cited as one example of this. The&apos; German trader knows how to makeskilful use of the difference in price between different markets, and is thus often in aposition to offer more cheaply than the foreigner. There is however no ground forthe suggestion that an import company would not do business of the same kind, in sofar as are-establishment of the relations between different markets, which have been somuch interrupted by the war, is at all possible after the conclusion of peace.A favourite objection against import monopolies is the clumsiness of stateadministration. The elimination of any interest in profits, it is said, leads to ineffi-cient methods of conducting business. The injurious effe3t of political influence isalso cited. Fears are expressed that the fixing of maximum and minimum prices andthe creation of State advisers would set limits to the free activities of the monopolycompanies. Considerations of commercial policy would often, it is feared, prevent themonopoly administration from seeking the cheapest markets and means of transport.One of the objects of import monopolies, for instance, is to enable Germany to useTurkey as a source of supply in the event of a new war, because of her easy landcommunications with Germany. With this in view the monopoly companies wouldoften buy goods in Turkey even when they are to be had more cheaply elsewhere, andthey would sometimes use the expensive land route instead of the cheaper sea route.a 3196 - c
It must be admitted that all these are factors which might reduce the proceeds ofthe monopoly! Nevertheless the majority of these difficulties could be met by betterorganisation of the monopolies. This subject will be referred to in greater detail inthe next section.3. The Profits to be derived from the increase of Selling Prices.It will be possible to raise selling prices in the case of articles of food such ascoffee, cocoa, tea, tobacco and tobacco products, and also of articles of luxury (as rawsilk) and of fodder, raw materials and manufactured articles which can be.replacedby home products. In this way we could have the prospect of an additional incomeof several hundred million marks ; so that on a careful calculation and makingallowance for possible reduction of demand the net gain from import monopoliesmay be calculated at upwards of one thousand million marks. A slight increase ofprice in the articles named would be negligible compared with the oscillations ofwholesale prices. The fear that the raising of prices would so reduce consumptionas to swallow up any surplus income is quite groundless. The raising of the sellingprice of coffee by the monopoly authorities would be equivalent in its operation to anincrease of the tariff. The results which are to be expected from that can be seenfrom the operation of the law of 15th Jnly 1909, by which the German coffee tariff wasraised from 40 marks per double hundred weight to 60 marks. It is true that the fouryears after the raising of the tariff showed a consumption per head of the population inGermany of 2&apos;59 kilograms, a reduction of some 14 percent., as against the fouryears 1905-8 before the raising of the tariff, when the consumption per head was3*01. Yet it would be a mistake to attribute this set back primarily to the raising ofthe tariff, for coffee in the free port of Hamburg rose in price at the same time from79.45 marks to 126.60 or -59&apos;2 per cent. Thus the rise in price was 47.10 markswhereas the tariff was only raised 20 marks. If therefore the proceeds of the tariffonly rose from 74.62 million marks in the years .1905-8 to 102.51 million marks inthe years 1910-13 and the increase of 37 * 9 per cent, was considerably less than therise of 50 per cent, in the tariff, this must be attributed primarily to the Brazilvalorisation scheme and the condition of the world market: In spite of all theseunfavourable influences a substantially increased.yield was secured.(a) The supposed Injury to the competitive Power of Industry.In the case of raw materials which are important for industry such as cotton, araising of selling prices is to be deprecated on financial grounds.&apos; On the other handsince the monopoly company is in a position to buy more cheaply than private firms,injurious effects upon the competitive power of the. industry need not be feared. Inpoint of fact, the industry would be strengthened through the increased stability ofprices. How rapidly prices alter can be seen from the fact that a double hundred-weight of cotton (middling America) at Bremen cost 62.80 marks in 1898,124.30marks in 1904, 97.2 marks in 1905, and 151.7 marks in 1910. Violent and rapidvariations of price such as these are particularly troublesome to manufacturers, andmost spinners and weavers would probably be very well pleased to pay a few pencemore for their cotton if they could be assured of stable prices. It is, therefore,intelligible that it is the spinners themselves who made the proposal to found aninternational association with the object of buying cotton on a falling market andselling it on a rise. This measure was proposed at the first international cottonconference at Zurich in 1904 by an Austrian, Kuffler, and at later conferences by aSwiss, Lang. Lang believed that a supply of, at the most, a million bales in storage,i.e., 3 to 4 per cent, of the world&apos;s production, would be sufficient to regulatethe price of cotton. He estimated the cost of interest on purchase price, storagecharges, insurance, exchange and administration at 9*6 million marks. An associationof German, or perhaps German, Austrian and Hungarian consumers would no doubtnot have quite the same effect as Kuffler and Lang&apos;s proposed association of thespinners and weavers of all countries, but the result would nevertheless be similar,although proportionalely less effective.The increase in the productive costs of industry need not, therefore, be feared asa result of import monopolies. Should such an increase nevertheless take place therestill remains the expedient to which objection might be urged on other grounds, that
of paying rebates on export under certain definite conditions. The export trade mightjustifiably bear certain burdens in compensation for the fact that import monopolieswould be used as a weapon of commercial policy in its favour.(b) The supposed Increase in the Cost of Living.If there is no reason to fear injurious reactions upon the competitive power ofindustry, the effect of import monopolies upon the standard of life of the mass of thepopulation need also cause no alarm. A reduction in the standard of life must at allcosts be avoided, for it would be a serious political mistake to do anything to runcounter.to the stream of patriotic sentiment in the working classes. But leaders arenot wanting in the Social Democratic party who are prepared to accept monopoliesunder certain conditions, even if they result in an increase of the price of certainarticles of common use. According to Cunow these conditions may be held to existwhen, as a result of the existence of private monopolies, the price of the articles inquestion would in any case tend to rise, or when the reduction of the monopoly wouldlead to the introduction of taxes which would bear still more hardly on the workingman&apos;s standard of life, or when the increase of prices is more than outweighed byan improvement in the conditions of working class employment in the Statemonopolies in question, through better conditions of work, securer tenure, the avoid-ance of crises, &amp;c.The conditions set forth by Cunow would in fact be largely met in the case ofimport monopolies. Monopolies which have the result of raising prices, in many casesforeign monopolies, already exist in. the case of coffee and mineral oil, and are threatenedin other commodities. The fear that the rejection of monopolies will lead to theimposition&apos; of other burdens still more objectionable to the mass of the people isonly too well founded. The idea that an increase in the State income amounting to16-18 per cent, of the national income, can be raised entirely by direct taxation isfrom the nature of the case impossible of realisation. If monopolies are thereforerejected, the only other alternative is to increase indirect taxes and customs duties.This would combine, all the disadvantages of monopolies without the correspondingadvantages (reduction, of the purchasing price of raw materials, promotion of theexport of manufactured articles, &amp;c).Added to this is the fact that it is by no means sure that the possible increase inthe price of raw materials will lead to any serious increase in the price of the manu-factured articles concerned. The cost of raw materials is only one part of the cost ofproduction. Equally important parts are wages, depreciation of machinery, rents andground rents of the factory and factory site, &amp;c, which all tend to reduce the influenceof an increase in the cost of raw material upon the price of the manufactured articles.Such an increase can in fact be wiped out by improvements in organisation, technicalequipment and workmanship. This view is supported by the investigations ofVon Heckel, who regards it as an axiom of experience that taxes on raw materials andhalf manufactured articles are less likely to be severely felt than taxes raised onarticles ready for use.Even if the cost is thrown upon the &quot;manufactured article it often makes verylittle difference in its ultimate price. It, has for instance been calculated that in theyear 1913, the barley tax of 1.30 marks per double hundredweight only increased thecost of pigs&apos; meat, which then cost 0.70-1.20 marks, by 2.9 pfennigs. Finally it isworth remarking that it is often possible to meet the difference by an increase ofwages. This increase of wages, is of course facilitated by the development of theindustry and the increase of its export trade. Import monopolies are a valuablemeans of increasing the export of manufactured goods and thus creating the conditionswhich enable wages to be raised. In so far as they do this they are actually in the-interests of the working class. ^4 The danger of the influence of Polities on the conduct of Business and upon-    : ,;      - &apos; :     Minimum and Maximum Prices.One last danger must be noted, as it is frequently referred to-the fear that, thepricepolicyof the. monopolycompanies will lead, to continual domestic^party strugglesStf thSXics willhave an influence on the conduct of the business of the monopoliesand      CSTea^ impossible.  Limits can, however, be
set to this danger by building up the monopoly companies on careful lines, especiallyby allowing private capital to have a large share in them and by granting themonopolies the greatest possible independence as against the state.Special attention must be given in connection with this question to the relationbetween corn import monopolies and grain production. Corn import monopoliescannot help recalling the controversy that centred round the Kanitz Bill of 1894. Butthe proposals put forward in this essay are very different from those of the Kanitz Billhowever much they may agree on certain points. Both aim at giving the Empirea new source of income and of facilitating the formation of war stores. Butthe general object of the Kanitz proposal as against that of the present essay was tokeep up the price of corn ; it was not concerned with the commercial aims which arebeing considered in this essay. Kanitz had no desire to put an end to the competitionbetween importing firms buying in foreign markets. The main point of his proposal layin the fixing of minimum prices. It was against this demand, which included a Stateguarantee for agricultural profits, that the strongest objections were raised. Most ofthose objections are irrelevant to our present proposals.Now, it must be admitted that&apos; we shall have to reckon with the fact that theintroduction of corn import monopolies will lead to demands for minimum sellingprices from agriculturalists. The reason given will be that the monopoly will upsetthe working of the corn laws and that the landed interests will therefore be in dangerof seeing grain sold at a price which would make farming unprofitable. This wouldcome about, we shall be told, as the result of a combination between a semi-publicsociety and certain political parties acting in the supposed interest of consumers.But such a development is excluded by almost insuperable difficulties; by theassociation of private capital in the monopoly company and the necessity of payinginterest on tha,t capital, by the great need of the State for money after the war, whichcertainly will not enable it to do without the income which it used to derive from thecorn laws, and by the fact that the indispensability of our own production of food hasgradually become a common-place as a result of the war. Moreover, it will be open tothe landed interest to associate its own capital writh a monopoly company and thus towin an influence over its conduct and policy. All these considerations  eem to makesuperfluous the fixing of minimum prices, a regulation which would greatly limitthe scope of the monopoly company. The most that could be conceded to agriculturewould be the provision that grain should as a rule be sold in the country only at aprice higher by the old tariff rate than the world price which would amount to thefixing of an elastic minimum in place of the inelastic price suggested by the Kanitzproposal. This would be sufficient to ensure for agriculture the continuance of presentconditions, and it could have no compelling reason under present circumstances fordemanding more. But even an arrangement of this sort would be very much open toquestion, for even if the monopoly company will of itself generally keep prices up tothe level of the world market plus the tariff, yet it ought to have the liberty inexceptional cases of departing from this rule. Such exceptional cases would not haveany appreciable bearing upon the profits of agriculture.Maximum prices are of course just as objectionable as minimum prices. It hasalready been shown above that consumers&apos;, interests can well be safeguarded withoutthem.Ill-THE STRUCTURE OF IMPORT MONOPOLIES.The defects which have usually been shown hitherto in the working of Statemonopolies are the result of methods of administration and can be avoided if othermethods are adopted. The best structure for import monopolies would be semi-commercial. The firms engaged in the particular branch of business would beamalgamated into a limited liability company or society, and the Empire and theseparate States would take part in the administration with definite powers laid downn the charter.The result of this would be that on the one hand the initiative and intelligence ofour business men would not be lost, and that on the other hand the Empire and theState would be free to exercise the necessary influence to forward the commercial andfinancial aims they had at heart. It would be desirable to form a separate companyfor every article, and then to arrange for an amalgamation of the different companieswith a single executive.   This executive might, during the transition period, be
imposed entirely of officials. It might be composed, of representatives of the Empire,&quot;he federated states, and. the different import companies, under the chairmanship of an[mperial Commissioner for the import of foodstuffs and raw materials. Later, itivoiild be desirable to form a holding company. The establishment of such a holdingjonrpany would enable third parties to join the state officials and business specialists whosat in the other companies. This would be particularly desirable in that it wouldlead to the import companies being more independent of the State and less under theinfluence of politics. This would reduce the danger that individual groups of tradersffould influence the raw material companies in their policy as to purchasing andprices and so render a really business-like administration impossible. The inter-taixture of State and business would also be an advantage to the Government bydiminishing the need for capital.The capital would be divided in such a way as to secure a decisive influence forthe Empire and the State in the holding company, and through that also in the othercompanies. This could be brought about by securing that the holding companyshould hold something over half the capital, and the Empire and the State more thanhalf the capital of the holding company. . How large a sum would be needed couldonly be fixed after careful investigations had been made in the case of each article,[t is not absolutely indispensable that the state should take part in the capitalisation ofthe companies in order to securo an influence and a share of the profits in the businessof the monopolies. According to the government proposal for the administration ofthe oil monopoly, the rights of the Empire were to be safe-guarded by an ImperialCommissioner, and nine-tenths of the surplus over, after providing for reserves, was tohe divided on the basis that the Empire was to receive four times as much as thejompany. The capital, on the other hand, was to be raised entirely by private persons,nritk the proviso, however, that the majority of the shares should be held by individualsand only transferred with the assent of the Imperial Commissioner. The ImperialCommissioner was given a council of experts nominated by the Imperial Chancellor.In the case of the Reichsbank, which is also a semi-commercial undertaking, thejriginal capital was raised by private persons alone. On the other hand, the adminis-tration and control is exercised solely by the Empire, and officials of the bank have therights and duties of government officials. The influence exercised by the share-holders in the general meeting and central executive is subordinate to that of thegovernment. After payment of preference dividends of 3^- per cent, and providing10 per cent, for reserves, 70 per cent, of the profits that remain passes to the State.In spite of these examples it may be assumed that the appointment of an ImperialCommissioner alone will not be sufficient to safeguard the government influence on thexmduct of monopolies, and to enable them to be used as instruments of commercialpolicy. Moreover, the Reichstag would probably desire that Imperial funds should beinvested in them, for the Reichstag committee for the oil monopoly, altered thegovernment bill on second reading by providing that one-fifth of the share capitalshould be contributed by the Empire, while ,the Empire was to have more than halfthe votes in the general meeting. The Imperial Commissioner was struck out by thecommittee as superfluous. Of the 21 members of the council, five were to be membersof the Reichstag.The creation of new official posts is to be avoided as far as possible in the wholeprocess of organisation. The business employees of the monopoly companies could beengaged on private contracts. The interest of the employees in the success of thecompanies should be encouraged by the grant of bonuses or proportions on the profitsof the company and by other similar methods. Previous commercial experienceshould so far as possible be utilised, and the directors and employees of existingimport firms should be enabled to enter the service of the new companies underfavourable conditions as directors, councillors, agents or commissioners.If the monopolies are established on these lines it is reasonable to hope that theywill go far to strengthen the commercial and financial position of Germany.
2. Extract from an. Article on International Trade versus a Closed NationalEconomy, by Dr. Siegfried Budge, of Frankfurt, in the &quot;EoropaischeStaa.ts-und-Wirtschafts-Zeitung&quot; for January .28th, 1917.The writer criticises the opinions pnt forward by economists in favour of the Statecontrol of foreign trade and the restriction of imports, and sums up their conclusions;as follows : &quot;The English ideal of free intercourse will be replaced in the future to&quot;an ever greater degree by the ideal of the greatest possible self-sufficiency of the&quot; separate economic communities of the world. Germany is as yet far from having at-&quot; tained this ideal. We must aim at reducing our foreign trade until it is no more than&quot; is absolutely needed to supplement our home production and that of our allies.&quot; .The writer then continues :  The economic history of Germany during the last 20 years before the outbreakof war, i.e., from JL895 to 1914, is an interesting commentary on the above. The yearsin question can be divided into two periods, each sharply distinct from the other. Firstthere is the period of the Caprivi commercial treaties, lasting from 1895 till the springof 1906. During this period Germany Was being drawn into ever closer contact withthe world market. The second period begins in the spring of 1906, when the Biilowtariff came into force and ended with the outbreak of the war. This period may beregarded as marking a reaction from economic internationalism towards the ideal ofa closed national economy.Closely examined, the first period reveals all the phenomena which the orthodoxeconomists have taught us to regard as signs of growing national prosperity and anincrease in the standard of comfort. Both the money wages and the real wages of theworking-class were rising. The rate of interest rose slightly, but remained at a lowlevel. The general level of prices was relatively low. A notable symptom of the risein the standard of comfort of the masses was the growth of a revisionist movement inthe ranks of the Social Democrat party, and the struggle of its adherents against thedogma of the &quot; increasing misery of the masses.&quot; This tendency is further exemplifiedin the movement of the population itself. Although, as the state of the money marketshows, the growth of population did not keep pace with the increase of capital, it wasnevertheless extraordinarily rapid. The rate of increase rose from 1&apos; 12 per cent, in1895 to 1&apos; 50 per cent, in 1900 (a boom year) and 1&apos; 46 per cent, in 1905. In that yeara small slackening in the rate of increase was observable, but the death-rate declinedfar more rapidly than the birth-rate. The surplus of births over deaths during the tenyears between 1895 and 1908 averaged 14&apos; 5 per thousand. Moreover, Germany, whichhad for a long time been an emigrating country, became during those years a countryof immigrants. The marriage rate was between 8 and 8&apos; 5 per thousand. These twolast phenomena in particular (i.e., the surplus of immigrants and high marriage rate)must be regarded as infallible signs of increasing prosperity among the mass of thepeople. Agriculture alone failed to share in this prosperity, suffering as it did froma fall in rents. There is no mystery about the general cause of the prosperitjr of thisperiod, it is to be-found in the increased facilities for the import of overseas foodstuffsand raw materials. This was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of thepopulation employed in industry, so that the exports necessary to pay for the importedfood were produced far more cheaply than the same quantity of natural products couldhave been produced on German soil. . The result of the cheapness of food was to setfree purchasing power for comforts, and thus to strengthen the domestic market. Allthis was accentuated by an unusually rapid increase in the population.The second period is sharply differentiated from its predecessor. The first ismarked by high money and real wages, low rate of interest, low rents, low prices,increase in the growth of the population, increase in the marriage rate, increase inthe standard of comfort among all sections of the population, agriculture excluded.The second period is marked by an increase in agricultural rents, high rates ofinterest, a sharp increase in prices, a decline in the increase of the population, adecline in the marriage rate. The increase in money wages continues ; but there areindications that real wages have not only not risen in the same proportion, but haveeven been reduced. The standard of life shows no improvement except in agricultureand in certain highly organised. branches of industry. The great mass of thepopulation enjoy no improvement in. their conditions, and there are universal coin-plaints about the cost of living. The three questions which form the staple ofdiscussion during these years, both among experts and the general public, are thefall in the value of gilt-edged securities caused by the rise in the general rate ofinterest, the slackening in the increase of the population, and the expense of living.
Let us look at these phenomena a little more closely. The period begins at atime of exceedingly good trade (1908-7).&apos; In the autumn of 1907 the boom is overand a depression sets in. From 1909 onwards there is a slow improvement, until 1912is once more a boom year. In 1909 the German surplus of births over deaths beginsto show a decline. This was at first attributed to the depression, but when the boomsucceeded it the decline continued : as against Id&apos;9 per thousand in the boom year1906 the surplus was only 12 &quot;7 per thousand in the boom- year 1912. All sorts oftheories were put forward as to the cause of this decline, which was believed by someto be attributable to changes in the physical disposition of the nation. But thedecline was accompanied by two other phenomena in the same field which pointedunmistakably to the increasing pressure of economic conditions upon the mass of thepopulation. The marriage rate fell from 8&apos; 2 in 1906 to 7&quot; 8 in 1907 and rose to nomore&apos;than 7&apos;9 in the boom year 1912. Still more remarkable is the fact that duringthe years 1906-10 Germany once more showed a surplus of emigrants over immigrantsto the extent of 0*5 per thousand, no doubt a small figure compared with that ofearlier decades, but, nevertheless, a sign of unfavourable economic conditions amongthe mass of the people. The rate of increase in the population reflects the sametendency, being 1&quot; 36 in 1910 as against 1*46 in the year 1905.Coupled with the decline in the increase of the population is a rise in the rate ofinterest, in money wages and in rents. In 1903 German 3-1- per cents, were at 102 &quot;3,i.e., substantially above par. In 1913 they had fallen to 85 &quot;82. Now, when the risein the rate of interest is accompanied by increased money wages and increased rents,and at the same time by a slackening in the rate of the increase of the population,there are strong reasons for supposing that the working class is experiencing agrowing difficulty in supplying itself with food and necessaries. As with the fall inthe birth-rate, so with the fall in the rate of interest, the most varied theories wereput forward. It was attributed, for instance, to the increased expenditure onarmaments and to the increased taxes on property, yet once before, at the end of theeighties and the beginning of the nineties, large sums were spent in Germany onarmaments without affecting the rate of interest. More weight might be attached tothe idea that it was connected with the increase of foreign investments. But thisagain is no real explanation, for foreign investments tend in the long run to reducethe rate of interest. They facilitate rather than hinder the production of naturalcapital and of increased supplies for the working class at home...It may of course be urged that the rate of interest rose during this period notonly in Germany but also in Free Trade England, and that England also had to dealwith a decline in the rate of increase of her population and a condition of falling realwages. England too, it may be said, had to face in the period before the war anincreased pressure upon the means of subsistence of the mass of the population. Itmust be remembered that causes were operating in England by which Germany wasunaffected... Mention must, however, be made of one cause which affected bothcountries alike.&quot; The cost of production of oversea natural products had begun to rise,and one of the effects of the great growth of population in North America was to leaveless oversea national products over for export purposes. An increasing proportion ofoversea foodstuffs and raw materials had to be drawn from South America, and thelonger journey necessitated an increase in the cost of transport. Moreover, a suc-cession of bad harvests led to an increase in tne price of cotton, the most importantraw material in&apos;the textile industry. It must be admitted therefore that even hadGermany remained&apos;&apos;a relatively Free Trade country the cost of living would haverisen, but it would not have risen nearly so sharply as it actually did.This brings us to the third striking characteristic of our second period.--the sharpincrease in prices. A small increase had already been&quot;observable;in 1896, but inspite of this prices remain relatively low and the. rise was hardly felt by the greatmajority of the population, since everywhere except in the country districts wages rosefaster.,than. prices. . But it was very different in the second period. . From about 1908onwards people began to talk about the expense of living, and the problem of highprices. The word &quot; expense &quot; does not.by any means denote simply a rise in prices ;it conveys something more a sense of pressure upon the customary standard of life.The rise in prices during the second period is more than a mere result of an increasein the value of money, it indicates difficulties associated with the, actual articles pur-chased. England too, showed a rise in prices, though not nearly so marked as ourown. If we compare the two periods that between 1901-5 and 1906-10, -Englandshows a rise in foodstuffs and raw materials of 7 and 9 per cent, respectively, while
the corresponding German figures are 11 and 17 per Cent. Thus we find the secondperiod, as contrasted with the first, exhibiting a decline in the rate of increase of thepopulation, a higher rate of interest, a rise in the price of the most important foodstuffs and raw materials; all three being ultimately attributable to a single cause, aslackening in the process of the internationalisation of German trade, and a reactionto the &quot;national&quot; economic ideas exemplified in the tariff of 1906, which led todifficulties in supplying the great mass of the population with natural products, andthus to an increase of agricultural rents.We may conclude therefore by summing up in favour of the older Englishorthodox theory, as against the ideas put forward by Jaffe and others. It is inter-national exchange and not a national economic system which have hitherto done mostto supply the German people with necessaries and luxuries. And this condition ofthings must always continue so long as we and the people who are economically andgeographically associated with us are unable to produce natural products on ournative soil as cheaply as we can procure them from abroad in exchange for our mami-factures. So long as these conditions remain, a &quot;national&quot; economy will not mean arise in the standard of living, but the reverse. If therefore we are only consideringthe question from the point of view of the standard of living, the internationaltendency must take precedence of the national.A word of warning is, however, necessary to prevent the question dealt with abovefrom being confused with two quite different problems. First with the problemwhether, in view of the general political situation and the possible danger of war, thetariff measures adopted in 1906 were necessary, and secondly, whether we shall notbe forced after the war by the behaviour of our adversaries to take further stepsalong the road of economic self-sufficiency. Only we must be clear in our own mindthat, taking things as they are, every step taken towards self-sufficiency will inflictincreasing injury upon the economic interests of the nation. It follows, therefore, thatthe more completely national we become economically the more slowly will our popu-lation increase ; and yet a rapid increase of population denotes an increase of thepower of the State as a whole.I would suggest, therefore, that the watchword of our future policy should beinternational trade, as far as the political situation permits, a national economy only inso far as is unavoidable on political grounds.3. The Case against Import Monopolies.(Translation of an Article out of the &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; 19.12.16.)Hardly a week passes without some writer or speaker demanding a Stateorganisation to control the entire import and export of our raw materials, even inpeace time. Instead of the free exchange which used to exist in our foreign trade, theideas explained in 1915 by Naumann and Rathenau under the names of &quot; IndustrialPreparedness&quot; and &quot;Protection of Raw Material&quot; are developed through Statesocialism into a communistic programme for the future.For the present the defenders of the time-honoured methods of trading contentthemselves with the demand that this temporary State control should be restricted tospheres where it is absolutely necessary and to a definite period of time which shouldbe as limited as possible. The reason for their moderation lies in their convictionthat the responsible officials will yet learn from the manifold experiences of thewar that no self-contained State organisation can make us independent of the naturalcourse of prices in world markets, or create an artificial Chinese wall for the so-calledprotection of German supplies of raw material.We have always been defenders of free industrial unhampered activity and world-trade. We realised from the first that all these State purchasing departments onlyoperate in favour of the raw material markets of neutrals; that the huge credits whichwould be necessary for the financing of these purchasing departments would suffice tomake them impossible; that it would be an incredible waste and misuse of invaluableability if all the varied experience and detailed knowledge of the merchants who havebeen engaged in the import trade were to continue to lie fallow and unused stilllonger; and finally that any State organisations for the purchase of raw materialswould, as a result of natural re-action, lead to the creation of counter-organisations,
export syndicates and other measures in neutral and enemy countries, which wouldforce up prices to such an extent as to make the war-time operation in these marketsseem mere child&apos;s.play/and thus seriously endanger the supply of our most necessaryraw materials on the declaration of peace. Nevertheless, it appears from a recentlecture by Under Secretary Michaelis about the future organisation of our cornsupply that these considerations have not yet received sufficient attention from thegovernment.Above all, those who are most enthusiastic for a so-called &quot;IndustrialGeneral Staff &quot; in time of peace actually appear to contemplate entrusting such anorganisation with the task of supplying raw material in peace time. It will thereforebe useful to consider the effect of the continuation of these compulsory regulations inpeace time.   Let us take as an example wool.- 1. Overseas Wool. The German domestic clip supplies in peace times onlyabout 6 to 7 per cent, of the total requirements of the German woollen industry.With rather less than 5 million sheep, our domestic production amounts to about75,000 quintals (16,500,000 lbs.) of washed wool. The net import of raw wool&apos;(not including tops, noils, &amp;c.) amounted in the last year of peace (1913) to824,072 quintals (400,000,000 lbs.) of washed and unwashed wool to the value of362 million marks (about 18,000,0001.). The chief wool producing&apos; countrieswhich export wool to Germany are Australia, the Argentine, Uruguay, the Cape andthe Transvaal. The supplies are bought by German manufacturers and importhouses at European overseas auctions through their own buyers or through corn-mission houses. A large part of the supplies of overseas wool are bought in theunwashed state and are brought to German commission combing establishments or toGerman, Belgian and French wool washing establishments for the purpose of combingand scouring. It was the business of the energetic and pioneering experts of the tradeto find a remunerative use for the various products of these combing and washingestablishments (tops, noils, waste, &amp;c), with full knowledge and experience as to whichmaterial is preferred by each branch of the industry. It is at least doubtful whetherthe heads of the State purchasing department could be always relied upon to possessthe specialised knowledge, the inventiveness and sense of satisfaction in their workwhich has, up to till now, enabled the wool trade, through constant personal intercoursewith its customers, to supply each of them with that particular class of wool mostsuitable for his machinery and his orders, and to do this amidst the constant changesand fluctuations of the market. It is these qualities which are mainly responsiblefor the amazing success of the German export trade in textile goods in the worldmarket.It is impossible to discuss at length whether the State organisation can allow tothe individual buyer, whether he be at the Central Office at Berlin or on the sheepfarms of Buenos Ayres and Port Elizabeth, or in the sale rooms at Sydney andMelbourne, so large a degree of bold initiative, of unrestricted action, of independentresponsibility, and thus make the Treasury liable for the payment of many hundredthousands of marks- irrespective of whether the operation turns out later to besuccessful or not. The parent houses of the overseas wool trade in Berlin, Bremen,and Leipzig can, as a rule, confidently rely, as to the right moment for buying andthe amount of their purchases, upon the&apos; judgment of their employees and businessfriends abroad. In the case of the private purchases of merchants and manufacturers,this risk is minimised by the check afforded by the enormous responsibility to theparent houses, by the opportunities which the free play of competition affords to theGerman buyer to acquaint himself with the course of business at home, and finally,by the restraint which experience has taught him to exercise in view of the activitiesof his neighbours and customers. This restraint is removed when the State has thesole right to import and to supply the home country. The inclination to speculatewould receive strong encouragement from a centralised State purchasing system,since the importers at home, deprived of their profits and occupation, would reappearas direct buyers or as agents for neutral firms, and so make&quot;speculative purchases,abroad against the German Central Importing Agency. In our own interests weought to avail ourselves again as soon as possible of the expert knowledge, theexperience and enterprise, of the energetic Germans abroad, who before the war wereacting as German wool buyers and are now interned in Australia or South Africa;and sober consideration alone aught to make us limit the period of State regulatedimports to the shortest possible time.It is urged that consideration for our balance of trade and for the re-habilitationof the value of the mark demands the&apos; prohibition of free imports over a long time.But except as regards the transition period there is nothing in this argument.   Soa 3196 d
far as our exchange in peace, time is concerned,, it is immaterial whether the15,000,000Z. sterling and the 120 million francs which we have up till now, on thebasis of peace values, sent to the English colonies and. to South America in paymentfor our wool imports, are provided on account of the Imperial Treasury or by ourlarge banking houses on account of commercial and industrial concerns. Further,those.who favour centralisation, entirely forget that in this case we should have tofinance our imports entirely with German capital and the use. of all foreign capitalwould be excluded. In this connection it is sufficient to point to the by no meansinconsiderable credits which individual wool markets abroad, e.g., Bradford, Antwerp,Roubaix, Tourcoing, and even Marseilles and Mazamet, afforded to the German wooltrade in the last years before the war.Finally, one further question of great social and industrial importance must heconsidered. Is it realised that every import monopoly undoubtedly involvespreferential treatment for large industrial concerns and inflicts irretrieveably adamage upon the weaker businesses, part of whose wealth consisted in the capitalthey enjoyed from wool dealers with whom they were in personal relations ? Therecan be no doubt that the Imperiallmport Office, like the War Wool Supply Company,could not give three or six monthly credits ; on the contrary it will continue thepresent practice of demanding cash payment from the manufacturer before the woolis despatched, leaving it to him to manage with his labour and his machinery toproduce well of badly in all probability badly rather than well from the rawmaterial allotted to him, the yarns, cloths, coarse materials, rags and felts which hiscustomers at home and abroad expect from him. Space does not allow more than amention in this connection of the disputes which State control in peace times wouldproduce, and which would affect manufacturers and their foreign customers even -more than merchants. . ;2. Domestic WooZ.-Dealers in the domestic clip have also experienced at firsthand during war time the same strict regulations in restraint of trade as merchantsin foreign wools. In this connection I should like to refer to my article on &quot;TheRequisition of the German Wool Clip,&quot; which appeared in this paper, No. 98, on the9th. April 1915.- The regulations which were then discussed have indeed sincebeen considerably modified in accordance with the development of war economy, andwith the regulations regarding other raw materials which have further limited theright of sale; but even so; in spite of the difficulties of the times, the regulations nowin force make it possible for the genuine wool merchants to do some business. It isclear that the Government only allowed  his limited activity to one branch of industryon the advice of their experts because they recognised that in this case the merchantswere not superfluous intermediaries who merely increased the price, but were anindispensable link in the discovery, buying and collecting of the scattered supplies ofthis domestic product.All the more astonishing, therefore, was the recent announcement that acommittee had been formed in agricultural and industrial circles for the &quot; Promotionand Disposal of the German Wool Clip,&quot; whose chief task would be to bring intocloser touch the two interested parties. This astonishment was further increased bythe additional information given concerning the organisations and societies whichhave hitherto been invited to the consultations at Berlin, amongst whom there wasnot a single representative of the German wool trade. What we have been able tolearn about the course of the negotiations makes this omission all the moreincomprehensible. There is no need, for instance, to emphasise the fact that all effortsaiming at the improvement and care of the German clip are of the greatest interestto the wool trade and would obtain its warmest support.It is true that the German wool trade regards with lively misgivings and con-siderable scepticism the proposal that the State should purchase the German wool clipat fixed prices guaranteed over a period of 15 to 20 years, and that it considered thecarrying out of such a proposal in peace times as practically impossible, owing to thenecessity of our export trade adapting itself to world prices. This conclusion, whichis based on experience gained in the great primary markets overseas and on generaleconomic considerations, cannot be further elaborated here; but the German wooltrade must make a strong protest against the agriculturalists&apos; proposals, made in thecourse of these consultations, to abolish the merchants in the future and to sell theirproduct direct to the State for military requirements. AIL who know anything of themethods of disposal of the home clip before the war wiU agree that such attempts,whether they are successful or not, reveal the ^utmost ingratitude to the wool
merchants. If the wool merchants had not been the chief buyers at the annual woolsales, the price of domestic wool would have fallen still more and in consequence thenumber of sheep would have declined still further. There can be no question ofselling our home products abroad for the next 5 or 10 years. It will have to bereserved for home use, for the Army and civilian trade, until the conditions in theworld market have become clearer and steadier. But neither can the elimination ofthe merchants as intermediaries between the producer and the consumer be seriouslyconsidered, since especially in the country, the small producer frequently sells hisfleeces direct to the local buyer who deals in woollen goods in the nearest small towns,and often receives payment in kind. To force the producer in cases like this todeliver his wool direct to the Central State Depot would cause serious difficulty andloss.3. Eastern Wool.-A few words must be added about the future development ofthe trade in Eastern wools and in other products of similar origin. The import oftextile material, especially of wool and cotton from the East, has been entrusted forthe last year to the German-Oriental Trading Company in Bremen, which distributesthe stocks obtained from the East to German and Austrian raw material depots fordistribution to Army contractors. One can safely assume that this organisation,created by the necessity of war, will be liquidated after a short transition period andthat the old established firms in the Eastern wool trade will once more be allowed toresume their time-honoured connections which are of such importance in view of theconservative traditions of the Levant. In the interests of South Germany it is to behoped that imports from this part of the world will not in future be forced exclusivelyinto the Hansa towns by means of tariff regulations, but that it will be possible againto use the Danube, and more especially of the Adriatic routes, along which before thewar so large a part of the Eastern wools were conveyed.4. Conclusion. Thus the German wool trade sees through all the dark clouds ofthe present a distant ray of hope lighting it towards a brighter future, in which it willbe compensated for the heavy damages caused by the present inactivity, be assured offull scope within the limits of its former sphere of action, and be enabled to take itspart in bringing about a healthy revival of our industrial life. Wool is not likecotton, copper, petroleum, &amp;c, which can be classified and distributed in definitestandard types. It can be used in such a variety of ways that a lot may be expensiveand unsatisfactory for one buyer, while for another it may be the cheapest and mostsuitable material. It is the wool trade alone which has the expert knowledge of allthe specialities of this article of world commerce and of the requirements of theindustry, and which is in a position to discover on behalf of its clients a suitable andremunerative use for every grade of wool. If one single organisation is used for thedistribution of the raw material, it will lead to a stereotyping of its consumption, andwill cause most serious injury^ to our textile industry in its competition in foreignmarkets.
