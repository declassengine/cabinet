Yiorthington-Evans, Vice-Chairman of Lord Milner&apos;sCommittee, with reference, to the supply of aircraft to theRussian Government from this country.I am to point out that the adoption of an arrangement,such as is therein suggested; is of the greatest importancewith a view to securing the engines necessary to the carryingout of an extended aerial policy.I am, Sir,lour obedient Servant,(Signed)    H. Pi HARVEY.The Secretary,War Cabinet, ,&apos;S Whitehall Gardens,S a &apos;iii*    1.fflTOIOGPRgi.A.B.276/26. 18th June, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the President&quot;of the Air Board tostate for your information and that of Lord Milnerrs Committee,that the Air Board have had under repeated consideration thequestion of the supply of aeroplanes to the Russian Governmentin accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet taken at theMeeting of the 22nd March.     The instructions of the War Cabinetwere to tho effect that a total of 800 aeroplanes should beordered for shipment to Bussia, but that no more than thosedealt with under existing undertakings should be shipped untilafter.the 20th June, having regard to the importance of havingan ample supply of aeroplanes for the British Expeditionary Forcein Prance during the next three months^I am to offer the following observations with regardto tho advisability of giving effect in the prosent circum-staxtces to the instructions given by the Cabinet three monthsago.
The Board have failed to obtain definite informationas to the orders for aeroplanes as distinct from engines,placed by the Russian Government in France, Russia and Italy.They know, however,, that a considerable number of enginesof the Hispano-Suiza, Clerget and Fist types have beenordered by the Russian Government in France and Italy*   Theyare not in a position to form an opinion as to. the extentto which there is a balance between the number of enginesand of aeroplanes on ordere     Judging however, from theexperience of the Board In connection with the contractsplaced on the Continent on behalf of the British, Frenchand Russian Governments for aero-engines, there is strongprobability that the supply of the engines on which thoRussian Government is counting will be seriously delayedand that the number available before the Winter season willbe less than was anticipated&apos; at the time when the Russianrequest for a large number of aeroplanes was addressed tothe British Governmente. he Beard further note that the request for aero-planes was accompanied by no definite specification.of anyequipment such as gana, wireless Instruments ahd otheraecessories essential to the efficient employment of themachines; nor has there been any mention of spare parts,which are of the utmost importance, as the aeroplanes wouldbe practically valueless without them.   It is also noteworthythat all the machines asked for are of the most modern type,having great speed and requiring the most capable and well-trained pilots and air mechanics of a correspondingly highdegree of skill.In view of the above considerations, I am to suggestfor consideration the following proposals:-The British Government to guarantee definitely tohand over to Russia the following aeronautical material in    ,time for shipment before mid-Movembor of this year;-50 SoE*5 single-seater fighting aeroplanes with200 ho pi motors of the Hispano-Suiza orSunbeam type.a- &amp;Qi;%pwrtth. Camels^pf single-seater type with&apos; . ?,v. rf c lor get mo t or s 650 RBEo8 Reconnaissance machines with R.A*.F,.4a.engines ,50 Sopwith Bomber machines with 130 h.p* Clergetor 110 h*pa Le Rhone engines/All the above machines to be complete with engines, guns,spare gear and all necessary accessories.The Air Board to prepare a suggested programme of aero-plane&apos; and engine deliveries from Great Britain to Russiafor 1918.The British Government to acquire from the RussianGovernment 390 Fiat motors of 250 h0p0 now on order, andto take delivery of the first.goo 200 Lu, Eispano-Suiza       motors, and 200 130 hup, Olergeb motors &quot;due for deliveryto Russia from the French contracts.
I am to ask that the views of Sir L* vortbington-Bvansand Lord Milner&apos;s Committee on the abore proposals may becommunicated to the Air Board,I am, Sir,lour obedient Servant,(Signed)     Hu Po HARVEY,Sir L. Worthington-Evano, M.P&apos;.Ministry of Munitions,
