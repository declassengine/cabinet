THE YGTXJTJS 01? INDUSTRY.-THE PLACE 0E LABOURlifllluiORAHDUJiBY THERight Hon. GEORGE IE 3ARHES 34,P.-X- * -X- -X- *  -X- *   -X- *The workman has generally looked askance at change,because change has generally operated^ in the firTt place,against him.   The introduction of machines and new pro-cesses in times gone by ha-3, no doubt, ultimately increas-ed the wealth, of the community and increased wages, buttheir first effect was to wipe out means of livelihoodfor some.     It is no use,&apos; therefore, putting propositionsin front of a workman and asking him to accept thorn-because they may benefit the oorMiunity.    He wants bo knowhow his interests are to be affected, -and he say3 that ifthe community is - going to benefit, the community shouldmake same provision whereby individual- suffering shouldbe obviated, - E(. This, he know?, is no new principle in publicpolicy.   When a public office is abolished the man whohad held it is compensated,   lin.on a Church is disestab-lished provisions are made f or. bishops , and priests,, /Whenproposals are made to control liquor time limit or .ccmpen-sat ion is assumed.   Land is sacrosanctJ   Why, saystheworkman, should labour be -different from other interestsin the community?I believe,, theoretically, in payment by results.But the workman has generations of ex-peri j^og behind  .him as to its practical results.   A man may have put hishead into his ^ori and. increased his earnings,  the inevit-able result being that the piece price has been reducedaccordingly.     He may not previously have consciously,restricted output, but he had not put his mind into hiswork.   Production, even in the most elementary tilings, isdetermined as to its amount by the exercise of intelligenceAnd intelligence was not paid for in the bad pre-war days.Much has been said about the restoration of pre-warconditions. The best thing to do with those pro-war condi-tions is &quot;to barter them away for better conditions.   I knowthose pre-war conditions. ,1 look back upon them with,loathing and disgust..   They were conditidna&quot;.based uponmutual suspicion and bickerings, not only as between employers and employed bat as between employed and employed.The skilled man looked askance at the semi-skilled or theunskilled man if either attempted to enter the 3kill.ed man&apos; g.domain.   No matter how much a new machine or a new methodsimplified a piece of work, that work was still regardedas the skilled.man&apos;3 job, Tho primeval curse was, in fact;turned topsy turvy.   A skilled man regarded a training toa trade as conferring a right to follow that trade - asa means by which to &quot;eat bread&quot;. And of course that meantwar between-skilled and unskilled labour - a war in whichthe unskilled was generally worsted by being deprived ofopportunity to better himself.This attitude of mind however, on the part of the.skilled worker -an attitude of mind which is still at thebottom of most of the engineering trade unrest during the war
was not a more manifestation of perver3one33.    It wasthe *outcome of knowledge and experience-already mentionedand which has raised the protection of hi3 trade.as asort of fetiisli in hi3 mind.     He knew that he waswording under competitive pro fit -maki ng conditions withinwhich he was liable to be displaced or by which hiswages might bo reduced by lesser skilled and unorganisedmen being retained to his disadvantage if he once agreedto their introduction.     He was&apos;nt against hi3 fellow-worker who was unskilled, except in the sense that he wasop.osed to such unskilled worker be in/2; used to lowerwages and increase profits.In another 3ense both skilled and unskilled tacitlyagreed, and that was in tho feeling.that there wasantagonism of interest as between them and the employer.In this aspect of things workshop conditions werecharacterised by a constant if unexpressed effort on thepart of employer and employed to get the better of eachother.      They were conditions in which neither side won,but in which the community always lost,    I don1t want togo back, or to see anybody go back, to those conditions.I want to see employer, employed, and the State co-operating to set up new and better conditions.The first thing that must be done in regard toindustrial reorganisation is to convince the men thatwe are not proposing to set up something after the warin any way analogous to that which existed before thewar; but that after the war, and in a world made plasticby common- struggle and suffering, we arc going to stampupon it the impress of a new order, breathing into ita new spirit altogether different from that which animatedthe old. . In ether words, that man is no&apos; longer to bepitted against his fellow-man, but that we arc going tolive as a community&apos;in which labour will be given resdue plicc and its just reward.    In my judgement paymentby results, accompanied by provisions for the protectionof labour, is the best basis for industry4   The war hasshown what payment by results can do.    To get the sameresults after the war there must be a feeling of con-fidenco engendered between all concerned, and a deter-mination to inaugurate some methods of remuneration andmanagement whereby a community of interest is set upand maintained,.Assuming, then,  the right spirit,  it becomeslargely a question of machinery.This implies organisation.   Employers- andwo rice r 3&apos; 0 r ga n i s at i 0 n s she- ul d a gr e e eat he r (a) j o i nt lyto pay rate fixers or (b)to have rate fixers, paid andcontrolled by the State.     In either ease employersshould a recce to pay the rates fixed by some archindependent authority to anybody who did the work.    Thiswould take away tho incentive c-n the part of any oneemployer, or group of employers, to reduce cost of pro-due ti en by - reducing piece prices,     It would remove&quot;temptation of substitution from employers and fear of iton the part of skilled workmen.   Employers would findother ways and means of saving - such as by improved
management ..&apos;.nci better buying - when labour was takenout of the category of raw material and treated on ahuman basis.But how, it may be asked, would this providefor a man whose labour may bo rendered obsolete by animproved process?    \7oll, wo should, I believe, re aclithat by stages..     Independent rate fixing would, inthe first place, prevent undercutting of prices.   Ivhenthe person who fixes these ceases to be the servantof. the employer, and becomes paid by a trade or by theState, he will begin to act in the interests of the tradeor the State.     If by a new machine or process.a certainamount of work can be done w-Ws many men as formerly, themthe pressure of competition of the whole can be preventedfrom reducing the wages cf those who remain to do thework.   And, as things begin to settle down on that basis,provision might be made for those displaced being providedfor either by other work:or by maintenance from a taretrade fund till trained.for and found other work. Suchprovision will, in fact, have ultimately to be made inorder to smooth the way for the use of the best andimproved methods of production.The be3t methods and the best machinery will bemore than ever necessary after the war, for the nationwill be impoverished, taxation will be high, and corn-petition will be keen with countries hit less hardly bythe war.But, given goodwill and co-operation, givena desire to promote an atmosphere of confidence in placeof that of mistrust, then thoro i3 nothing to fear,The British workmen are, I believe, tho best in theworld when they put  heir best into their work.   Let usbut create the conditions to induce them to do it andall el^e will bo added to us.    For a time the anarchistswho have been troublesome during the war will betroublesome after it;   but, if we set out house in order,labour itself may &quot;be trusted to sweep them aside withthe contempt they deserve.-* * * * *- -x- -* * -x- -x- *
INDUSTRIAL UBKSST.A week or two ago I wrote a few lines on the questionof industrial unrest from the economic point of view.   I nowadd a few words on an even more important aspect of the samequestion.   There are two main causes of industrial unre3t. -One economic and the other psychological.   The workman i3 dis-satisfied with his wages hut he is even more dissatisfied withhis status.     He is not given that place to which he feels heis entitled;There have &quot;been two conflicting tendencies in industriallife during the last 30 years. There ha3 been iona in the direc-tion of centralisation and another in the spread of education.The first has given power to the few and taken it out of thebands of the many.     The second has instilled in the minds ofthe many the feeling that their place in the scheme of thingsshould not be le33 but more than it has been in the past.   Thisconflict of forces is not peculiar to industry.   It is foundpresent and i3 the cause of disquiet in the organisation ofsociety generally.   Private business concerns have been swal-lowed up by the multiple Shop Companies and InternationalTrusts.   The machine in politics has become powerful and localfeeling has little chance except when on occasions, such asrecently in Edinburgh, circumstances are favourable.But it is the world of Labour organisations with which Iam here mostly concerned.     Time was when Executives of TradeUnions were engaged all day in following their trades andmanaged Trade Unions after the dayfs round in the workshop wasdone.     They themselves were subject to the conditions whichthey imposed upon others.   How each large Union has it3 full-time Executive as far removed from the workshop as the PrimeMinister himself.     The Trade Union working member in Glasgowregards London as a long way off not only in a geographicalbut in a psychological sense.   He roads in the newspapers ofmeetingsbeing held in Whitehall or elsewhere; he gathers thatworkshop destinies are being decided there and he feelsthat, within the limit of. power of hi3 Union, he hes not asfull an opportunity for putting his weight into the scale asthe far less educated man had 30 years ago.No one is to blame for this.   It i3 the inevitable outcome of competitive struggle in a Capitalist environment and .of improvement in methods of transport which have broughtthe world into a more manageable compass.   These causes willin fact continue to operate for the simple reason that thingsare lone more efficiently, and produced more cheaply -whendone or produced on a large scale.   The large-scale methods,however, have conflicted with human rights and human emotions.These are the sort of difficulties that are now shoeingthemselves upon the horizon.   They produce a smouldering dis-content, liable at any time to be fanned into flame by irre3-ponsible persons.   They are the underlying bottom causes ofDublin revolts, of &quot;Workers Committees&quot; and industrial SinnPeinism generally.     They are the sort of things that appalthe most far-seeing Statesman,to whom the future is, as aconsequence, presented in a gloomy aspect.   They are the sortof/
of things, however, that must be faced and dealt withbefore we can have industrial peace or political peace. Pormy part, I am in favour of dealing with them by way of trustand co-operation.   Democracy and efficiency must be broughtinto harmony instead of being in conflict.   Somehow or other,the men at the circumference must be connected up with tnoaeat the centre.     They must be given a place- in the scheme ofthings and made to feel that they have a voice in determiningthe conditions under which they work.We must aim at giving Home Rule to industry.   If con-stitutions are good for distant parts of the British Empire,they are no less good for trades; the only safeguard being thatthe operations in a district of a Trade should harmonise witfcthe interests of the Trade as a whole.   In giving effect,how-ever, to this principle we are met on the threshold by anotherpsychological factor.   There are a certain number of workmenwho despair of improvements by evolutionary methods and arefrankly destructive; they are anti-everything that is pallia-tive, and opposed to any measures which may bring employerand employed into better relationship,   fortunately4 they areonly small in number and may be ignored^ provided that allemployers and employed, including the State a si an employer,make an honest effort to put their house in order.   It mustbe shown that the human factor is to be given a chance inindustrial reconstruction and that any changes made are not ofa oharacter such as will stereotype economic relations.What then can be done, while keeping these considerationsin mind,to put industrial conditions on a better basis?   Pirst,I believe the Unions must give Shop Committees a recognisedplace in their Union organisation.   It is not enough to arrangethe terms of agreement for workmen.   Except in cases of urgencyand emergency,\ they should be consulted before such termsbecome operative.     This should he done through consultationwith the Shop Committees, convened outside by the districtcommittees of the Trade,   The, Shop Committees should be madethe medium through which to operate agreements and on the otherhand for the views of the shops being conveyed through theShop stewards to the Union district committees and Executiveauthorities.     The Shop Committees should be made the ShopExecutive to uplf Id conditions agreed to by representative con-ferences of employers and employed.    It may be said that thisinvolves but little change. But, speaking from inside knowledge,I can say that it involves a good deal.   The Shop Steward andShop C^nmitteeo have generally been kept at arms1 length bythe elected authorities of the Unions, a fact which accounts fora good deal of Union troubles.   They have had to fight forrecognition from their own Unions as well as from their Employ-ers, and in the fighting have been torn in twain.   Whole-heartedrecognition on the part of the Unions would rid us of part -at all events of industrial unrest.But there should be recognition as well on the part ofemployers.   Of course there is difficulty owing to Conflict ofinterest of the different grades of labour.   But there are atleast some things in which there io identity of interest, 8ndin respect to which the employers, and all grades might co-:operate with advantage.   There is the amicafele settlement ofpurely/
purely workshop disputes, the framing and maintaining ofrules for -workshop discipline,, and the provision offacilities for technical&apos; inn ruction,   On all those thingsEmployers and Employed might come together in a spirit ofmutuality and good will, Employees leaving each grbde tomanage its oun business \*ith its,own Union but being billing,either direct or through representatives 7always to meet anygrade, to deal with matters bearing upon payment of labour...Let these things be done, let but. a sustained appealbe made to the better nature of workmen - and I believe thatShop Stewards will cease to.be mere irresponsible promoters ofmischief and become partners and f el low-wo risers for industrialorder.A bebte^ atmosphere would be created in which pettythings wo aid be viewed in proper perspective and in which thebest use would be made of ihe &quot;best means of production of goods(Sgd) GEORGE - IT.,.
