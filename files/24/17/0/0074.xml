From Sir P. Cox, 22nd June 1917.(Addressed to Foreign ; repented to Secretary of State for India.)(Received at India Office, 23rd June at 6 a.m.)2255. Reference to Secretary of State&apos;s telegram 22nd June. Officersfor Mesopotamia.I welcomed appointment of General Clayton as my deputy because I wassufficiently acquainted with, his work and qualifications to feel confident thathe would be a valuable acquisition, and in order to fall in with the wishes ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government as indicated in Secretary of State&apos;s telegramdated 30th March. But if he is not coming I beg I may be permitted tomake my own arrangements as hitherto. If Dobbs is able to return (and asyou know I should welcome him) it is for post of Revenue Commissioner orSecretary that he is best fitted and in which he would have the greatest scope(vide my telegram of 18th May, 1612).Independent of above, if Mr. Storr&apos;s services could be given me not asDeputy, but as Oriental Secretary it would jnake it [possible to pay moreattention during the war to questions affecting Arab interests and policy forwhich work his services would be most valuable. He would at the sametime be a useful liaison with Egypt.
