Department of Information.rar/003.Weekly Report on Spain* 111*(20th June, 1917.)The real situation in Spain remains very obscure.,     Oa thesurface things are fairly calm but it would be absurd to pretendto be sure what is happening to-day underneath and may c^oe-to--tha -surface to-morrow.All that is absolutely clear is that the immediate crisishas been got over and that Senor Dato, the Conservative leader,has formeda Cabinet on the basis, practically, of a surrender tothe demands of the Officers.     This, Count Roman ones, probablythe ablest of the regular politicians, refused to 3.0 on the groundthat the Liberal party could not be responsible for a surrenderof the civil authority to the military.    Senor Dato was veryreluctant to accept office and has no doubt done so because theConservative Party cannot refuse to listen to an appeal from theCrown.    He is himself an honest, well-meaning man, though likehis predecessor Garcia Prieto, a man of no particular ability.The new Cabinet contains some members of pro-Gorman proclivities,but the Prime Minister and tiie majority of-his-more importantcolleagues, especially Marquis Lema, the Minister for ForeignAffairs, are pro-Ally in feeling; and the Ministry will certainlybe more friendly to us than the last.The most striking appointment is that of General Primo deRivera, a very old man, to the Ministry of t/ar.    He is known tohave been strongly opposed to the Officers* Committees, the re-pression of which he advised some time ago.    What he will or cando remain? to be seen.     It can only have been at the personal
m    2   mJappeal of the King that he has taken office in a Ministry formedon the &quot;basis of surrendering to the demands of the Committees.In these demands, and perhaps still more in the way theyhare &quot;been presented and enforced, lies the great gravity of the&quot;no.present situation.     It is quite clear that General Marias wassent to Barcelona because his predecessor had failed to copeadequately with the Committees, and that he not only got furtherthan General Alfau but had to recognise the necessity of releasin gthe officers whom General Alfau had arrested.     It is now loiownthat he had hardly arrive.-?, at Barcelona before he received a veryformidable address from the officers setting forth their grievancesand insisting that their demands should be granted in all thegarrisons of Spain within twelve hours.    The document does notmention the name of the Kin//,, and declares that the infantryofficers are &quot;expressing for the last time their desire to respectdiscipline, but only on the following conditions&quot;; after whichfollow their demands which are, briefly, the release of theircomrades, no reprisals, and recognition of the Committees.     T$eythen give their word of honour that they will never become acentre of insubordination and will respect constituted authority.The bulk of the memorial is occupied with complaints of the neglectof the Army by successive Governments, of, the unjust accusationsmade against it, and of favouritism and other abuses in itsadministration.     The Committee asserts that it receives &quot;implicitobedience&quot; from the infantry throughout the country, that theCavalry and Artillery are in sympathy with it, and that all aredetermined to act for &quot;the advancement and defence of theirinterests&quot;.This is in effect a peaoeful pronunciamiento and its successshows the danger of the situation.    On its exact meaning it istoo early to attempt to pronounce.     The best opinion seems to be
that it is in reality, at least in the main, what it claims to he,that is, a professional movement;     This is in itself sufficientlygrave.      or it is in substance a policy of syndicalism adoptedhy the Army.     It is the last result of the profound discontentcaused in the Army by the unpopular Moroccan wars and their mis-management, to which, by the way, the King, whose personal policythey were supposed to be, owes most of whatever diminution of hispopularity has occurred of late years.     Then it is to be notedthat it is up to the present entirely an officers1 movement thoughit professes to take a paternal interest in certain grievances ofthe men.     It aims at increasing the power of the corps of officersin Spain, already in western and liberal e^es sufficientlyprivileged by the law of jurisdictions which refers disputesbetween civilians and soldiers to military tribunals.     But at thesame Senor Lerroux, the Radical and Republican leader, a man of: A -   -great ability and few scruples, is said to be trying to organisea separate syndicalist movement among the rank and file, a stillmore serious symptom of the gravity of the situation.On the other hand&apos;it does not appear that the Army agitatorsare acting with any political party, and there is so far no greatsign of their desiring to interfere in political issues.     It isdifficult to say whether their success in obtaining their pro-fessional demands will satisfy them and quiet down their agitation;or whether on the other hand it will stimulate them to furtherassertion of their power.     Their movement does not seem to haveany great bearing on foreign issues.     The majority of the officersDCmay have German sympathies and the pro-German press ostentatiouslysupports their resentment of attacks made upon them.    But a largeminority is believed to have, leanings to the j&amp;itente, and there isno likelihood that the corps of officers as a whole will take anyaction affecting Spanish neutrality.     The significance of their
^conduct is rather to be looked for in connection with internalpolitics.     For the first time the Army has separated itself fromthe King.     It knew that the course taken was against his wish andin pursuing it it made no profession of respeot to him.     It appears(though the words do not occur in all versions) to have spoken ofpromising to &quot;respect the powers constituted by the will of thenation&quot;i language which is interpreted not as sincere liberalsentiment but as a kind of an attempt at blackmail addressed to theKing.    And it chose the revolutionary city of Barcelona for theprincipal scene of its activities.These are grave symptoms, and they are not made less so by thefact that parallel activities of a similar syndicalist order havebeen occurring among civilian servants of the State.    The employeesof Beveral of the Ministries, amongst them-those of Finance, Postsand Telegraphs and Public Works are reputed to be organising defence. Committees; and to have sent a delegate to Barcelona to confer withthe military Committee.     The democratic parties are talking of ageneral revolutionary strike and trouble has actually occurredamong the miners.One of the greatest differences between autocratic regimesof the old order, and modern States with a free press and democraticorganisations is that in the former things happen before they aremuch talked of, in the latter there is apt to be a great deal oftalk before anything happens and indeed often without anythingever happening at all.     It may well be that to-day in Spainagitators may make speeches and write articles and form committeesanfl that nothing very definite or important may come of it all.Sen or Maura may ooquet with the Carlists but the Army is nott Carlist.    The Army may put pressure on the King but it is certainlynot Republican.    It is only what every Spaniard is except thelittle world of politicians who alternate in office, reward their
friends and work the machine of government.     The Army, that is,like everybody else desires a radical reform of the present system.And sooner or later in one way or another there is no doubt thatthey will get it.     But the process is not at all certain to beeither rapid or revolutionary.The most immediate&apos;political result of the crisis has been itseffect upon the parties outside the official ring.     The King con-suited only the official Liberals and Conservatives.     This hasenraged Senor Maura and led his followers to deface the King&apos;sportrait at their Club.     On the other hand the three unofficialparties of the Left, that is, the Reformists, the most intellectualof Spanish parties, the Radical Republican party of Senor Lerroux,and the Socialists under Senor Pablo Iglesias have met and formeda &quot;bloc&quot;.     The chief importance of this lies in the action of theReformists who are led by Senor Alvarez, and include so mapydistinguished men that they are sometimes spoken of as a party ofleaders without followers.     This parti rallied to the Monarchysome years ago when the King summoned their leaders to the Palaceand consulted them about public affairs.     They have been indignantthat no real change in the political system has followed from thisand in particular that in the present crisis the King has consultedno one but the official ring of politicians.     They have thereforejoined in the new bloc which has an avowedly Republican programme.What the attitude of this group is towards the Army is not veryclear.     It resents the attempts of soldiers to dictate to thecivil government; but at the same tine it sympathises with theaction of the officers as an effective protest against the shamsand incompetence of the present system.All this makes the position of the King extremely difficult.Good judges still think him the most popular man in Spain and fewdoubtjthat he has liberal sympathies, desires to understand theWants of his people and to do.what is best for the country.     But
Q &quot;he has inherited the old. system of &quot;made&quot; elections and unrealparties and, no doubt between the violence of extremists on eitherside of it, does not find it very easy or perhaps feel muchtempted to escape from it.     And, like too many Kings, he issurrounded by friends and courtiers who are more men of pleasureand have no real knowledge of anything going on in the country. .It is evident that he feels his personal strength, a permanentKing, with the prestige of a Kins;, among a group of shifting anddiscredited politicians.     He uses language in private which showsthat he thinks of himself as most definitely governing&quot; as well asoccupying the throne.     But tiiis very strength is also a weakness;for it makes him personally responsible for the existing abuses,exposes him to such direct attacks as those both of Maura andLerroux, and leaves him with no screen from the revolutionarystorm   if it should burst.Ho great change is likely in Spain!s attitude towards the war.The new Cabinet is, as has been said, more friendly to us than thelast; whatever influence the new Radical &quot;bloc&quot; may possess willcertainly be exercised in our favour; there is no reason to thinkthe Army at all actively pro-German; and the King himself iscertainly not unfriendly to tfce Allies.     But the unfortunate anti-dynastic attitude of many of our Spanish friends has an inevitablyunfavourable effect upon his mind, whieh was natually alarmed byevents in Russia and is not likely to be reassured by events inGreece; especially as the German agents in Spain always representus as stirring up revolution everywhere and as engaged in doingso in Spain itself.     The main interest, however, of the Spanishsituation at the present moment is internal not external.     \7hat-ever pressure may issue from either side the foreign policy ofSpain will certainly remain for.the present one of neutrality,t)&apos; 0 B -
