ttettort to the Cabinets60 1AeB.153/21 23rd June, 1917.1.. In oompliance with the instructions givenby the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 14thinstant, the Air Board have had under careful ccn-sideration the question of the development of theoutput of aircraft during the next 12 months. They  .have also conferred on the - sub joet with the \7arOffioe and trie Ministry of Munitions * ,aKd they un-derstand that Lord Dsrby, who presided, over theconference, will submit the conclusions arrivedat to the War Cabinet.So far as the actual supply of aircraftis concerned the conference were informed by therepresentatives of the Air Board that it was hopedto increase the output of engines from all sourceswhich at the 1st January 1918 wb-uld be 2200 amonth, to 4000 a month in July by a regular gro*7thof 300 a month, provided certain conditions asregards priority and the supply of ball bearingsand steal alloys etc, could be aooeded to.One of the chief difficulties whichpresents itself is that the output of aeroplaneswill largely exceed tho number of Tickers machineguns required for arming them, which under pres-ent arrangements there is any prospect of obtain-ing.   It is understood that the Master Generalof the Ordnance has this matter in hand.Meanwhile, if the large output ofaircraft contemplated in the course of next yearis to be attained, orders must be placed a longtime ahead for those types of aeroplanes thedesigns of which are likely, without seriousmodification, to meet the requirements Of theservices for a prolonged period.   This is the caseespecially with training machines, which arepractically standardised, and in a less degreewith reconnaissance machines.   The Board is ao-oordingly considering the placing of large orders ,.ifor aeroplanes of these two categories.2.
