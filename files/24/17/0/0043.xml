Intelligence BureauDepartment of InformationTJOBSLY   REPORT   ON   :;-RAi,CEJune 21st 1917There is very little that is new in the situation in Trance.The Stockholm fiasco is beginning to recede into the background,and now that the German 1 majority Socialists have published theirviews about a peace by agreement, even the Socialists who were soanzious to go to Stockholm will probably lose whatever was genuinein their enthusiasm for that project.     They oan hardly continuewith any seriousness to desire a conference with people who notonly altogether reject the French claims to Alsace Lorraine butexpressly refuse to admit that tho countries devastated by the warhave any rights to restoration!     It is too difficult, these Germanssay. to decide who oamsed the devastation!    The only &quot;restoration&quot;these generous gentlemen admit is that of politioal independence,and even this is only offered to Belgium with the impudent glossthat Belgium ought not to be a vassal of Germany any more than ofPrance or England.    Perhaps the Socialists may now really learnthe futility of discussions with the Kaiser&apos;s Socialists.     In anycase they will probably learn that they will not improve their po-sition in France by any further coquetting with the enemy, evenwhen he woars an Internationalist disguise. - So far as their de-sire to go to Stockholm was an honest belief that it would servethe cause of a just and permanent peaoe, and many of them no doubtsincerely believed this, they will probably, though no doubt theywill not admit it, perceive that the belief was mistaken and thewhole scheme futile;   so far as they were aiming at advertisingtheir party they oan scarcely fail to see that they have done it
no good, but the reverse.Meanwhile, even before the -^renouncement of the German So-oialists had been published, the Trench Socialist party had shewnthat their essential union 7/ith the rest of Trance remained un-broken, not only by sup-sorting the votes of credit demanded by theGovernment on June 15th so that they were carried with practicalunanimity (533 to 4), but also by making a declaration of policywhich reaffirms the most important of the war aims of the nation.It was read to the Chamber by their leader, M, Renaudel, and, ofcourse, uses language which wuld not be used by the other parties.But, according to the Socialist newspaper, the Humanitet it wasreceived by the rest of the Chamber without any expressions of dis-sent in what the Socialists themselves interpret as a friendly 3i-lenoe.    the silence of the Debate and the Temps as to this tendsto confirm the Socialist aooount.The document is not, of course, very original, but it isworili noting, from the British as well as from the French pointof view.    it strikes, as its friends truly say, both notes atonoe, the human and the national.     It is international end ideal-istic, but it is also definitely Irench.    Of oourse thO formerpart of it, which is its originality and the reason why the partypublishes a separate declaration of policy, is both longer and moreemphatic.    but the reaffirmation of the solidarity of the partywith the country as a whole is perhaps quite as important.     Thedeclaration states that &quot;to-day as yesterday&quot;   the Socialist partytakes its part in support of the effort of France and her Allies todeliver the invaded parts of France and Belgium, to restore therights of Alsace-Lorraine violated in 1871, and to bring about thepolitical and economic restoration of the small oppressed nationsor fractions of nations.    this is a formal endorsement of the main
q.&apos;kva ^ the allies as frequently stated hy their governments.   andas that it deserves to be noted with satisfaction.The longer and speoifioally socialist part of the documentmakes, of oourse, its allusions to secret diplomacy, peaoe withoutannexations or penal indemnities and the future society of nations.but there is nothing very new or even controversial in what is saidon these subjeots.    more ndtable is a thinly roiled sneer at thesenate, which is aooused of not understanding the principles enwhich the new free world must be based;   and, moro interesting toenglishmen, the. denunciation of tho &quot;governments of prey&quot;, iifBuoh exist, as is politely added), which &quot;seek to satisfy theireconomic appetites or dynastic ambitions by the conquest of distantcolonies, or roly upon strategic annexations for those guarantees*f security whioh are only to be found in a new organisation of theworld based on law and justice.&quot;    it is obvious that if the germans,when thoy oome to discussing peace, try to separate prance and en-gland, as of course they are sure to do, by denouncing our colonialgreed as standing in the way of the generous proposals they wouldotherwise make, they will find the &quot;renoh sooialists ready to walkinto their trap.for the rest the manifesto is interesting as affordinganother piece of evidence as to the anxiety felt about the temperof the soldiers, whioh was. discussod in last week&apos;s beport.    itdemands a more humane and equal treatment for the men and insiststhat severity, even to death, should be as freely meted out to of-fioers as to men, whe are guilty of serious failure or neglect oftoty.    if this stood alone, it might mean little;   it might be no-thing but a party bid for popularity.    but when one finds the sub-3ect of the&quot;lassitude&quot; of the soldiers discussed in papers whioh areertainly not socialist, the matter is evidently one deserving of
attention.     No one, as the Humafrite&apos;itself says, alleges that the&quot;moraltt of the Army isanythihg hut sound ih the main - at least noone says so in public, though there are ugly private reports, rjro-bably exaggerated, of soldiers on leave calling for &quot;peace or a re-volution.&quot;    But, apart altogether from rumours of this sort, it isobvious that there is some cause for watchfulness, if not for anxiety,when not only does the Humanite talk openly, without any interferenceby the Censor, of the danger of lassitude and discouragement weaken-ing the national defence, hut M, Maurice Barres writes a series of ar-ticles in the Conservative Echo de Paris, alleging that the Germansere fixing their last hopes on the enfeebling of the &quot;moral&quot; of Pranceand particularly of the Army.    Like the Humanite he advocates va-rious reforms which would make the soldier1s life easier.     So doesI. Herve in the Viotoire and he does not hesitate to assert that sol-diers on leave generally enhibit &quot;une grande lassitude.&quot;   And nowI. Painleve, the Minister of War, has announced that he is trying toarrange for the return to civil life of a large number of the reser-Tista, men of mature age, who are no doubt just the men who most feelthe discomforts of the soldier1s life, and not unnaturally resenthaving to leave their farms or their businesses for the Army wherethey feel their time is being lost to themselves with very littlegain to the country.    This will quiet some of the most active andbest grounded discontent;   and if he could provide better pay and re-gular separation allowances for the soldiers who remain with thecolours, it is likely enough that the worst of the trouble would beover and only the ordinary and inevitable soldiers1 grumbling remain.Tho excuse for a renewed reference to this subject is of^coursethat nothing in Prance is so important to the Allies as the conditionQf her Army.   The fact, then, that she is not quite comfortable&amp;hout it is one of which English observers ought to take note.J * 0 * B.
