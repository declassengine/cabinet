4/Mesopotamia/l4.Report of the Mesopotamia Commission.I circulate for the information of the WarCabinet minutes by the Director of Personal Services, theAdjutant General and the Judge Advocate General on theobligations of the Army Council under Article 527 of theRoyal Warrant for Pay &amp;cvDERBY-.25th June, 1917..
The question has arisen as to the circumstances underwhich an officer can he removed from the Army, called uponto retire or to resign his commission, and by and under whatauthority such disciplinary action can be taken.The recent Inquiry set up by the House of Commons intothe case of Second Lieutenant Barrett might have produced asituation much as follows and I will suppose for the sake ofargument that the recommendations of the Commission were tothe effect that certain officers should be called upon toretire.     I will suppose that the Commission made recommendationsto this effect to the Cabinet and the Cabinet directed the ArmyCouncil to give effect to them.     I will suppose that the ArmyCouncil did not agree with the views and finding of theCommission and that an impasse was reached wherein the ArmyCouncil disagreed with the Cabinet.     The question arises couldthe Cabinet enforce upon the Army Council their views and requirethem to give effect to their decision.     In my opinion they couldnot for the following reasons :-An officer serves under a particular Act of Parliament,namely, the Army Act.     He has certain remedies under thatAct contained in Section 42 and I will allude to this againat a later date.     The liabilities under which an officersuffers in regard to his removal, retirement, or resignation,are contained in Articles 525 and 527 of the Royal Warrant.I will leave Article 525 out of the question for amoment as the removal of an officer from the Army can be effectedsummarily by the Sovereign without any question of opinionarising but under Article 527 it is laid down that an officermay at any time be called upon to retire or resign hiscommission should the circumstances of the case in the opinionof Our Army Council require it.     I should argue that underthese circumstances the opinion of Our Army Council, that is tosay, a quorum of three members, must be formed upon the factslaid before them having regard to all the evidence which may beavailable.     I hold that it is incumbent upon the Army Councilto enquire into all the evidence before coming to that opinionand that they could not in law or in equity accept the opinion orthe directions of the Cabinet if in fact their opinion did notcoincide with that of the Cabinet.I wish to further strengthen my argument&quot;by emphasizingthe fact that every officer has under Section 42 pf the ArmyAct a statutory right of complaint.     Section 42 of the Army Actlays down that if an officer thinks himself wronged......hemay complain to the Army Council in order to obtain justice, theArmy Council are required to examine into ouch complaint andthrough a Secretary cf State to make their report to HisMajesty in order to receive the directions of His Majestythereon.It is here convenient to refer to Note 2 to thatSection wherein it is expressed inter alia that the ArmyCouncil are required to examine into the complaint and reportto His Majesty   and that they are not debarred from expressingtheir own view of the case.Supposing for the moment that the Army Councildealt with an officer under Article 527 of the Royal Warrantwithout
9Qf)hJ \J \Jwithout forming an opinion hut merely accepting the directionsof the Cabinet it is obvious I submit that if an Appeal wereaddressed to the Army Council under Section 42 of the Army Actthey would in lav/ be required to examine into such complaint.Such examination would, of course, require the scrutiny of allthe evidence bearing upon the case and it is conceivable that onthe examination required under Section 42 they might come to theconclusion that the Appeal should be so upheld and so recommendthrough a Secretary of State to His Majesty^A recent case in the High Courts of Justice has butconfirmed the opinion which has been held by lawyers in regardto the rights of an officer.     The Lord Chief Justice (I ammerely quoting his words from memory) laid down in his judgmentthat where an officer is serving under a military code he cannotseek redress for supposed wrongs by any other channels thanthose laid down in the Army Act.     Under those circumstances Isuggest that his disposal cannot be effected by any other meansexoept under the provisions of the Army Act and the RoyalWarrant.1 My memorandum may, of course, appear ridiculous and&quot;suggest that the Army Council are superior to the Cabinet - thatis not my intention.     I maintain that the Army Council areby law required under Section 42 to examine and under Article527 of the Royal Warrant to, form an opinion;    that opinion Isubmit must be their own, unfettered and duly formed upon thefacts and the evidence which must of necessity be submittedto them.     They cannot divest themselves of their statutoryobligations which devolve upon them under the Letters Patentwhich created them.     The solution of the problem, of course,is that if the Army Council cannot agree with the Cabinet thenthe Cabinet would have to find an Army Council that would.   Theywould in fact have to go on until they created an Army Councilwho in a quorum of three would form the opinion which theCabinet desired.In conclusion I would suggest that by law the ArmyCouncil in such cases could not accept the ipse dixit of theCabinet but are required &quot;to examine&quot; and &quot;form an opinion&quot;.If the Army Council took action under Article 527 and calledupon an officer to retire under the directions of the Cabinetwithout enquiring into the facts of the case and forming anopinion I would suggest that their action would be ultra viresand that in the event of an appeal against that decision beingreceived from the officer concerned under Section 42 of theArmy Act they would be required to &quot;examine into such complaint&quot;Such examination, of course,  of necessity would take the form &quot;ofan examination of all the evidence brought against the officerwhich led to his being called upon to retire.     If it wereadmitted for the sake of argument that the Army Council couldblindly call upon an officer to retire without making anyenquiry into the evidence against him how could such action bemaintained if in the event of an Appeal they would subsequentlybe required by law to enquire into it.(Sgd.) B.E.W. Childa.
I entirely agree with the above minute(Intld.) C.F.3tf,M.,A.G.3.May I have your remarks please.(Signed) B.E.W. Childs,23/6/17, D.P.S.4.IUP.S.1, I concur in the views expressed in the ahove minuteas to the legal position of the Army Council under Article 527of the Royal Warrant for Pay and Section 42 of the Army Act.2.     If in the circumstances stated the Army Council werecalled upon to require a particular Officer to retire or resignhis Commission under Article 527 of the Royal Warrant, it wouldin my opinion be the duty :of the Army Council to form and   .express their own opinion according to the merits s.nd Justiceof the case, and they would not in my opinion be bound orentitled to act merely upon instructions received from theCabinet.     The duty of forming an opinion is cast upon theArmy Council itself &quot;by the words of Article 527.3.     If an Officer who had been called upon to retire orresign his commission under Article 527 were to complain tothe Army Council under section 42 of the Army Act it would bethe duty of the Army Council themselves to examine into suchcomplaint and through a Secretary of. State to make theirReport to His Majesty in order to receive the directions of HisMajesty thereon.     This-is a statutory duty of a quasi-judicial nation imposed on the Army Council by the Army Actand if it could be proved that they had failed to discharge itI think that they could be compelled to do so,4.     It would, I think, be unreasonable to hold that therewas an obligation on the Army Council on the instructions ofthe Cabinet to express an opinion under Article 527 of theRoyal Warrant, v/hich they could not support or endorse in aReport which it might subsequently become their duty to makeunder section 42 of the Army Act.5.     I have dealt only with the position of the ArmyCouncil under Article 527 of the Royal Warrant.     The Preroga-tion of His Majesty to dispense with the services of anOfficer at any time is undoubted, and if His Majesty did soon the advice of the Cabinet, the Officer would&quot;have no legalremedy.J.
