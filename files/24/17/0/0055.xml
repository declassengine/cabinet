SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,     . -I.Department of Information.DGW/0G7.WEEKLY REPORT OR GREECE. VII.June &apos;2o, 1917.No report on Greece has &quot;been issued &quot;by this Bureau since June 5th.The situation has altered so violently from day to day that it isdifficult to fix on any moment as. the proper one for making a surveyof how things stand.   Further., such full information has been suppliedby official telegrams, as published in the Western and GeneralReport, and by the British press that there is little or nothing toadd as to facts.   But it may be worth while to call attention toone or two instances of the misunderstandings which have arisenas to the character aid meaning of the abdication of KingConstantine and the consequent changes in the Greek situation.Three- Points of View on the Constitutional Issue.There seems no doubt that there are throe very distinctivepoints of view as to the future status and policy of Greece inconsequence of the Allies&apos; actions.    The position of the extremeRoyalists has found expression in the proclamation issued by KingConstantino.   There is no allusion in it to his &quot;abdication&quot;:   heis merely &quot;quitting&quot; his &quot;dear eountry with the Crown Prince, leaving&quot;his &quot;son Alexander on the Throne&quot;.   Similarly the new King Alexanderspeaks of his being &quot;entrusted by his august father with the heavyduties of the Hellenic Throne and promises to carry out his sacredmandate .....following the lines of his brilliant reign&quot;.     He isfurther &quot;convinced that in obeying the wishes of my father, thePeople, by their submission, will do their part in enabling ustogether to rescue our dear   country from the terrible situation In
Ihich it finds itself&quot; i   Briefly, the attitude of King Constantined his successor is that they have yielded to force majeure.Greek papers of late enough date have sss yet Oome to hand toupply any information as to how far the Royalist populationindorses this attitude, but there is every probability that itsint of view will for some time remain that of the ex-King,!ven many months ago anti-Venizelist papers had contemplated thepossibility and even approved the wisdom of a tactful withdrawalfrom Greece on the part of King Constantine, and had assured himthat if ho did so his sacrifice for the sake of his country wouldneved be forgotten.   The conviction that the Central Powers aretoo strong to be overthrown even by the rest of the world in armsagainst them has become, through the assiduous propaganda of theGerman agents and Royalist officers, so deep-rooted a conviction inthe minds of the Reservists and anti-Veniselist partisans generallythat they may well hope that, though for the moment it is necessaryto bow to the temporary supremacy of the Entente Powers in Greece,the moment may well come before or at the end of the war whenthe Central Powers, at least In the Balkans, will be in a strongenough position to secure the return of King Constantine to theGreek Throne.   This is the language used by the German press, andit is probable that pro-Germans in Greece will console themselveswith this hope.It is not only pro-Germans and extreme Royalists who may becontemplating the eventual return of King Constantine.   Thelatter addressed a very warm letter of farewell to Mr Zaimis,expressing to him his &quot;warm thanks for the numerous services youhave rendered Greece and myself during my reign&quot;,   Mr Zaimis,though not by any means a personal enemy of Mr Venizelos (in faothe has always been quite the contrary), has been forced by conviotion
,r circumstances to stand for an ideal directly conflicting withthat of the Venizelist movement.   He almost certainly regrettedthe intemperate behaviour of the Court cliques, Reservists&apos;Leagues and the Ghounarist&apos; partisans who brought Greece intodirect conflict with the Protecting Powers.   At the same time,he disapproves of the Venizelist movement, he was against inter-yention in the war, and he apparently objects honestly to the wayin which, as it is alleged, Mr Venizelos has subordinated theinterests of his country to those of the Entente Powers.   BehindMr Zaimis there may be a considerable, though fluctuating, amountof moderate and non-party neutralist opinion, which, opposed toboth Venizelist and anti-Venizelist extremist activities, mayyet hope to bridge the gulf between Athens and Saloniki by acompromise in which the question of divergent principles isgilded over by an accommodation allowing to each party its shareof power and Influence.   Mr Zaimis has indeed offered to admitVenizelist elements into the Government.   He will, hov/ever,certainly not agree to the public admission of the Venizelistvictory.   The most sinister points about Mr Zaimis1 attitude are:(a) that he countersigned King Alexanderfs proclamation,thereby directly flouting Venizelist opinion, and(b) that, according to Sir F. Elliot&apos;s information, he evenwent so far as to ask for the Italian occupation of Yannina inorder to forestall the Venizelists.These two actions on Mr Zaimis1 part show that he is morestrongly opposed to the Venizelist movement than we might haveanticipated.   Till they are explained or condoned it seems impossiblefor the Venizelists to join the Zaimis Cabinet or in any way toaccept the idea of co-operating with him in the interests ofGreek national unity.
I have not attempted here to enter into the constitutionalfinicalities of King Conetantine*e &quot;abdication&quot;.   The matters  however, been much discussed in the press:   most aptly inTemps of June 17.ne Situation in Epirus and Thessaly.It may be recalled that Yannina v/as occupied by the Italianorces on June 8.   From there they pushed East and South andccupied Metsovpn and Philippiadhas &quot;without incident&quot;.   Some weeksgo Count Bosdari had informed Prince Dyemidov that, if the Frenchccupied Thessaly, Italy, as a guarantee, would occupy Epirus downo the Gulf of Arta.   This threat has not been carried out literally.talian forces were, however, landed at Pargha.   To counteractpliis move the French occupied Prev^za on or about June 15.he French occupation seems to have been desired by all the Greekopulation - except the Royalist factions - as a safeguard againstfurther advance of the Italians, whose political aims are suspected.The French   Advance into Thessaly began, according to plan,on June 11.   Larissa was occupied on June 12, after &quot;desultoryfighting&quot; with a small Greek 4crce;   Elasson on June 13, Volos -Without resistance&quot; - on June 14.   By June 15 French oavalryhad reached and occupied Kalambaka, Trikala, Kardhitsa, Sophadhisand Demirli.   By June 17 Pharsalos and Dhomokos were in French&quot;nd Demirli in British hands.   Consequently the entire province*as in the occupation of the Allied forces.If newspaper reports are to be trusted, the population ofThessaly has, on the whole, apart from the Reservists and thefew regular troops who offered armed resistance, welcomed theFrench and British occupation of the province.   This is notsurprising, for most of the inhabitants are Venizelists for
*easons of internal politics.    If Venizelos can keep his promisesf radical agrarian reforms it would seem that the province might beon to his side fo r good, even though no Venizelist troops are forhe time being to be admitted there.   Even the Royalists of Thessalye, apparently, clever enough opportunists to have swung round totie Entente side.As for Epirus, the action of the Italians in occupying Yanninad other towns will still further intensify the anti-Italianeeling among the Greeks.   Apparently, however, the conjecture putorward in Report No.6, that the anti-Venizelists would exploitgainst Venizelos his inevitable acquiescence (even if under formalrotest) in the&quot; Italian fait accompli, is not likely to be provedme if Sir P. Elliot&apos;s information is correct that it was Mr Zaimisho asked for the Italian occupation of Yannina in order to forestallhe Venizelists.   The support accorded to the Royalists by theItalians in Corfu and Epirus generally will discredit the formern the eyes of Greek Nationalists.   It is all the more unprincipledn the part of these Rpyalist politicians to have engaged in such anIntrigue Inasmuch as Italy&apos;s policy had, till six months ago, beenne of the principal alleged arguments they produced against anliance with the Entente.. Venizelos has always done his best toiome to an understanding with Italy, and he may, therefore, welleel aggrieved at the attitude of the Italian authorities during thefcst six months.A.W.A.L.23.6.17.
