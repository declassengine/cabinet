SECBE * V ^&quot;.t:&apos;      v Intelligence  Bureau,Department of Information.BWA/006.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary. VI.(23rd June, 1917.)The crisis in the Dual Monarchy resembles more and more theoondition of a rheumatic patient.     When special treatment hasallayed the pains in one part of the body they merely transferthemselves to another and mere local treatment cannot restore thepatient to health.     After almost three weeks of negotiation theEeterhazy Cabinet was formed in Hungary on June 15th, and onlyfour days later the Clam-Martinic Cabinet handed in its resignationIn Austria.    The fever has spread throughout the whole bodypolitic.     Unfortunately it is quite impossible to form any clearestimate of the political situation on the basis of the extremelyscanty information which reaches this country through tiie ordinarypress channels; and no official information appears to be availablefor the period of the last week.      There is no country in Europeosacerning which the information published in the British press isso misleading and inaccurate as Austria-Hungary, and it is oftendangerous to accept statements of fact, still more criticisms ofevents until they can&apos;be verified from the Austrian or Hungarianpress, v/hich of course only arrives in this country at least a weekUte under war conditions.    Plentiful instances could be adduced,wen from most reputable papers, of fundamental mistakes regardingParties, races and constitutional problems, such as render the newsinserted quite unreliable and sometimes incomprehensible.I do not therefore feel justified for the moment in attempting;,ny survey of a situation which may fairly be described as chaotic,v/hich may at any time take an unexpected and far-reaching
development.     In another week&apos;s tine it ought to be possible topresent a connected account of recent events.The comments of the Vienna and Budapest press on the selectionof Count Ester hazy as the nev Hungarian Premier show that hisown country was as unprepared for his selection as was foreignopinion.     He is not unnaturally treated on all Bides as a darkhorse.     Tiszafs official organ, the Pester Lloyd, in an articlewhich seems to damn him with faint praise, says that he has nopast and that his qualifications for the post arc unknown to thepublic.     The Social Democrat organ describes hin as &quot;an unwrittenpage&quot;, the Radical Reformist Vilag as &quot;the hero of the question-narks&quot;, while the old-standing Liberal Ujsag compares him to thesecond tenor who takes the place of the Heldcntenor when he is toohoarse to appear upon the stage.     Perhaps the best summary of theposition is that given by the Neues Pester Journal which declaresthat no one in Hungary knows what the now nan will be, thatEsterhazy does not represent a clear new programme or a newcourse, but is rather to be regarded as a &quot;Transition man&quot;, oreven perhaps as &quot;a man to fill an awkward gap&quot;.     The difficultyof estimating Bsterhazy^ value and future attitude may be bestillustrated by attempting to find a parallel in British partypolitics.     It is as though on l r. Asquith&apos;s resignation lastDecember the King, instead of summoning Ur. Bonar Law and Mr.Lloyd George, had entrusted the task of formink a government toone of the younger Conservative members who had never hold eventhe most subordinate post in any previous government.     It maybe added that Count Esterhazy is widely regarded as owing hisselection - apart from the fact, always important in Hungary,that he belongs to a specially powerful magnate family - to thefact that he has been a brother officer of the young Emperor andwas thrown much in company with him earlier in the war.
Finance, made a very lengthy expose of the financial position inopening the Budget debate.     The fact that   he vrithheld all theessential figures of expenditure and left the House virtually inthe dark,although no figures had &quot;been submitted for over three/ears, shows hov/ little reality there, is in constitutional andparliamentary control in Austria.     It is only natural that theauthorities hesitate to rc7eal the full truth, which cannot bevery far removed from bankruptcy. -The war liabilities of Austria, as officially announced,amount to 44,226,919,544 kronen ( 1,842,789,000).     Of this no lessthan 1,844,166,400 8r. ( 76,000,000) have beon lent by Banks inthe German Empire (quite exclusive of the enormous amount ofHustro-Hungarian public stock which they hold).     These figures donot of course include Hungary, whose war expenditure has not as yetbeen made public.     It cannot amount to less than one-half the abovesum - say, from  900,000,000 to  1,200,000,000.At the moment of writing it is announced that Count Clam-Hart inic, who saw himself obliged to resign owing to the PolishClub1 s persistence in opposition- (which left him faced with aBtrong Slav majority in Parliament), was requested by tho Emperorto reconstruct his Cabinet, but after negotiations with the Polesand Southern Slavs, has had to abandon the attempt.There are persistent rumours * of rioting in Prague on a moreor less revolutionary scale, and it is even reported that aVorkmen*B Committee has been formed from the factories of thecapital and its district, with the purpose of securing a CzechConstituent Assembly.     As yet it is impossible to verify the news.There can however be no doubt that the atmosphere throughout Austriais becoming more and more electric and that the leaven of theRussian Revolution is working among all classes and races.    Butit would be7 a grave mistake to suppose that there is any analogybetween the situation cf Petrograd last March   and that of Vienna
Budapest to-day.     There is no real basis for a revolution,ier the stress of a military disaster on the Russian or Italianjnts sudden developments on the &quot;internal front&quot; might possiblyour: till then the typically Austrian system of &quot;Portwurstein&quot;jogging along&quot;) which has boon erected into a political system,likely to prevail.R.W.S.W
