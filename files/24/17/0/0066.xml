Confidential.Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee. April JJp$RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.German Post-War Economic Policy.VII-ITALY AND THE AUSTRO-GERMAN MARKET.In spite\of the Paris Conference, the Italian Government has found it impossibleto prevent the continuance of trade in certain staple forms of agricultural produce(e.g., oranges and lemons) between South Italy and the Central Powers. The samedifficulty is likely to come up in an aggravated form when the question of futurecommercial relations between the Allies comes np *for review after the war. Somelight is thrown upon the position of the Italian Government by the following article,entitled &quot; Peace Terms and Commercial Relations,&quot; which appeared on April 19,1917,in the well-known Italian weekly, UUnitd, edited by Professor Gaetano Salvemini,who is, and has been throughout, a strong supporter of whole-hearted joint action byItaly with the Allies in the prosecution of the war.The writer (Sergio Azzollini) refers to the general veto on imports recentlydecreed by the German Government, and proceeds as follows&quot; Two reasons may be assigned for this step. Firstly, to prevent German moneyfrom leaving the country, and thus counteract any further fall in the exchange ; andsecondly, to avoid giving assistance to some of the belligerent States, and in particularto Italy, which in pre-war days used to export large quantities of agricultural produceto Germany. It is suggested, in fact, that the prohibition was particularly directedagainst Southern Italy, in the hope that the population of those districts, touched in avital spot, would agitate in favour of a peace on German lines.&quot; The German action is on a par with the manoeuvres which were justlydescribed by M. Briand as &quot;attempts to poison the entente peoples.&quot; It is evidentthat a veto on imports by Germany at this moment cannot be an effective measure.Germany is vetoing the import of things which she badly needs but cannot secure,and which nobody has any intention of selling her. But she is hoping that theveto may lead to an agitation in the Italian provinces affected by it, and may thusprovoke dissensions between the various districts of Italy.&quot; The device, which is no doubt regarded by the Germans as Machiavellian, ismerely childish, and has been recognised as such by the agricultural population ofSouthern Italy.&quot;Nevertheless, th,e measure is symptomatic of a danger which would confrontItalian agriculture, especially in the Southern districts of the peninsula, if, in thecommercial negotiations which must accompany the future peace, our Governmentallows itself to be influenced by the.industrial protectionists and ignores the rightsof the agricultural populations, who are giving of their best blood to the war, and,unlike the manufacturers, are making no profit put of its financial necessities.During the last few decades Southern, and a large part of Central, Italy have passedthrough a disastrous crisis in the wine-growing industry. They have succeeded inovercoming infinite and almost insuperable difficulties by gradually and, as opportunityoffered, replacing vine culture by other more profitable forms of cultivation. Fruit,vegetables, and early produce in general have played their part in helping thosedistricts to emerge successfully from a perilous economic situation. Trains filledwith cherries, pears, apricots, table grapes, potatoes, cauliflowers, tomatoes, andfresh vegetables used in pre-war days to pass to and fro in thousands between thosedistricts and the chief markets of Austria and Germany. Never before hasagricultural Italy struggled so hard to improve her cultivation. This has beenparticularly the case in Apulia, where the phylloxera caused terrible ravages inthe vineyards. It was the connection set up with the two Central Empires whichprovided the means of accomplishing this transformation.&quot; The European War broke out just at the moment when Italy was prepared toreap the harvest of this situation. Profiting by experience, she had decided to recon-stitute only in part the vineyards destroyed by phylloxera, and was embarking ona complete and radical change in forms of cultivation.&quot; It is obvious that this new cultivation cannot prosper unless its products finda satisfactory market abroad.   Let us leave aside for the moment the Austro-Germanz   (33)2656-4   Wt 61481-51   125   5 17   E&amp;S
2market, which was, in pre-war days, their chief outlet, and examine whether it can bereplaced in the near or distant future by markets in other European countries.&quot; The products in question are articles of the most perishable description. Theycannot be carried long distances without suffering deterioration, and they must,therefore, find a market at not too great a distance from the place of production.It must also be remembered that they are not first necessaries of life, but moreor less articles of luxury. Methods of packing and freight charges therefore have animportant bearing on their price. They must necessarily travel at express rates.It follows that not all markets are in a position to absorb them. It is only the morepopulous, wealthy, and important centres which are able to take them.&quot; Leaving out of account the markets of Germany and Austria-Hungary, wherewill Italy be able to place her early produce ?&quot; Spain both produces and exports similar produce.&quot; France produces for the most part what she needs, and supplies her deficiencesfrom Spain better and more conveniently than she could from Italy.&quot; England, for reasons of distance, finds it more convenient to buy in France,Portugal, and Spain, since she is thus able to use sea transport, which is more economicalthan transit by rail.   The same is true of Belgium and Holland.&quot; Reasons of distance exclude from consideration Russia, Denmark, Sweden, andNorway. We are left with the Balkan States-Serbia, Bulgaria, Roumania, Greece,and Turkey. But some of these are lacking in rapid means of communication, andothers are producers and even exporters of similar articles. They cannot, therefore,replace for us the markets of Germany and Austria-Hungary.&quot; I do not go into the case of Switzerland, because that country would alwaysremain open to the trade in question.&quot;This rapid survey forces us to the conclusion that when the war is overagricultural Italy will continue to need the markets of the Central Empires for thenew forms of produce which the transformation of her agriculture puts her in aposition to sell, and which she can sell nowhere else.&quot; If this conclusion be accepted, it is important that in the future peace negotia-tions the interests of agricultural Italy in the Austro-German market should not beforgotten. Neither, of course, must the interests of industrial Italy be overlooked. Butthe industrialists must not be allowed to secure arrangements which will prove preju-dicial to agriculture, and especially to Southern agriculture. The industrialists mustbear in mind the disastrous situation which would arise if Germany were to reply tothe barriers which our industrialists set up against her manufactured goods by erectingbarriers of her own against our agricultural produce.For some time past there has been a conflict of interest in Italy between theindustrial regions of the North and the agricultural regions of the South, and econo-mists of repute have frequently declared that the interests of the latter have beensacrificed to those of the former. Now the immense struggle in which we are engagedwill lead to the solution of many important problems outside the field of politicsproper. It cannot fail to leave its mark on the whole question of international trade.Let our statesmen make use of this exceptional opportunity to devise a fiscal systemwhich, without betraying the interests of any class or group, allows Italy freely toexpand her energies on the economic field.&quot; Editorial Postscript. We do not forget that the Russian market may in thefuture offer a larger outlet than in the past to our agricultural produce, includingthose articles more especially referred to by our contributor. When direct railwaycommunications have been established between the Danube and the Lower and CentralAdriatic, the agricultural produce of Central and Southern Italy will find a direct andmore rapid means of communication, not only with Bosnia, Serbia, and Hungary, butalso with Poland and Russia. But such hopes as we are entitled to cherish in theabsorbing capacity of the markets of Russia, Poland, and part of the NorthernBalkans do not allow us to ignore the importance of the German market.&quot;A brief statement then follows as to the importance of improving the transportarrangements for agricultural produce, both on the Italian railways and steamshiplines, and the institution of a direct line of steamers between Palermo and London isadvocated comparable to the direct line between Jaffa and London, which increasedthe orange trade between the Holy Land and London from 1,880,000 francs in 1900 to8,500,000 francs in 1913.
