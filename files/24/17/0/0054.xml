The Home of Recovery at Go HersGreen is occupied by an increasing number of patients butthe full capacity now estimated at 105 Is insufficient by55 to clear the waiting list.   A farm colony to take 50to 100 convalescent neurasthenics Is wanted as an annexeto Golders Green.   Various buildings in England have beenand are being inspected with a view to other neurasthenicInstitutions,   One is yj anted for Scotland,   Provision hasbeen made for some 30 neurasthenics to be employed onagricultural and forestry work.It was decided that there was no need of a homefor officer neurasthenics.(2) Epilepsy,     The provision of additionalaccommodation at Lingfield in Sussex has been started.Facilities are to be provided.for the accommodation offrom 40 to 45 discharged soldiers at Konyhull nearBirmingham.   The need for an Epileptic colony near Dublinwas considered but no action has been taken.   The questionof one for Scotland is to be dealt with when Sir A,G,Boscawen next visits that country.Training;.6-, On the 14th instant the Statutory Committee undercover of their Circular No. 47 (Appendix III) issued twofurther reports drawn up under the Ministry of Labour uponopenings

Copies of these roports which deal withemployment in Picture Theatres and in the Retail BespokeTailoring Trade are annexed (Appendices IV and V)Appendix VI is a further circular from theStatutory Committee (Ho. 50 of June 19th) on the subjectof training intended to give overy local committee ageneral guide to the occupations in which men are mostlikely to be able to find employment in their district,7. Courses of training in a wide range of usefulsubjects proposed by the Aberdeen Committee, in mechanicalengineering proposed by the Pifeshire Committee and inbasket making proposed by the Dublin Committee have beenapproved and the Training Section of the StatutoryCommittee have also dealt with the training of a numberof individual men.Organisation.8. A statement of tho proceedings of the StatutoryCommittee for the week ending the 20th June is annexeda 4(Appendix VII)4     The Stockton-on-Tees and Tynemouth LocalCommittees are, according to the reports of the StatutoryCommittees Inspectors, doing their work well.   Carlislehas hitherto failed and Cumberland has Cound it necessaryon account of increased work to remunerate the clerks ofsub-committees.   The Greenock work Is largely done byladies who have at their disposal voluntary funds.9, On the 14th Instant Sir Arthur GriffithBoscawen attended the first meeting of the LancashireJoint Advisory Committee, held at the freston CouncilChambers when the duly accredited members of the 42 Local&quot;Committees in Lancashire and Westmoreland met for thepurpose of constituting  the Committees.   Mr. E. CozensHardy was elected chairman;     three labour organisations,the Red Cross Society, the military, medical, andInsurance
1 7i, Iinsurance authorities were invited to nominate represent a-tiie s and a sub-committee to deal with educational matterswas formed, &apos; ,On the same day Sir Arthur Boscawen receivedat Liverpool two deputations from rival federations ofdisabled soldiers and sailaJ?swho set forth their grievanceswhich were mostly matters which could have been dealt withsatisfactorily by the Local War Pensions Committees withwhom the men seemed insufficiently in touch.On the 3 th Sir Arthur attended at Bristolthe second conferonce of the counties of Gloucestershire,Somerset, ?/Ilts and Dorset.   The Lord Mayor presided andrepresentatives from Devon and Cornwall were also presentsThe War Pensions Committees from the six counties resolvedto form a Joint Committee under Section 2 Subsection 8 ofthe Naval and Military War Pensions etc.. Act.On the 18th June the Chairman and Secretaryof the Birmingham War Pensions Committee were received bySir Arthur at the Ministry of Pensions and discussed withhim some 16 matters connected with the administration ofthe Royal Warrant;      on some of these it has been possibleto take action.On the 20th Sir Arthur received therepresentatives of the Surrey Local Committee who haddeclined to join the proposed Joint Committee for Kent,Surrey, and Sussex.   They consented to withdraw theirobjection provided the Joint Committee had advisory func-tions only, all executive matters being left to the con-stituent Local Committees.Staff, etc.10. Table III shows an addition of 61 to thestaff of the Department during the week 20 being added atChelsea,  5 at the Tate Gallery and 15 at Baker Street.The staff now comprises 171 men and 2,944 women or 3,115in
In all..   The Statetory-&quot; Committee - employ 106 men and 181women or 287 in all, bringing up the grand total to 3,402. .The recent small increases in men include 3appointed as awarding officers at Chelsea.11, The daily percentage of absences during the weekwas 1,5 among the male and 4,3 among the female *   At theTate Gallery the latter percentage was 5*3,     On the 21stthe work of Improving the ventilation was commenced there.At the Tate Gallery the Air Raid alarms (two) oflast week entailed some loss of work but this was made upby overtime.   Arrangements are being made for periodical&quot;Fire Drill&quot; with a view to regulating the speedy transferof the Staff to the rooms and passages in the basement whenfuture alarms  &amp;**e given.   The roof being almost entirelyof glass, this is very advisable.   The males on the Staffare also being Instructed (after 5 o1clock) by an expertfrom the Office of Works in the use of the &quot;Fire extingaish-ing appliances&quot;.12, On the 16th instant the central office of theMinistry containing the Administrative Award to Officers^and Award to Seamen Branches was removed, in consequence ofan award by the Postmaster General en the accommodation tobe provided for Sir Eric Geddes!s staff, from Great GeorgeStreet to Westminster House, Millbank, two floors of whichhad been placed free of charge at the disposal of the Officeof Works by the British American Tobacco Company,The removal was carried out with great celerityby the Office of Works with the result that little more thanhalf a dayfs work was lost.The accommodation-now at the disposal ef theministry is certainly excellent as regards the higher staff,but the number of comparatively small rooms makes thesupervision of some of the branches and the :Typists1 sectiona matter of some difficulty, and there is no room for theexpansion which is Inevitable in some of the branches -in,, thenear
near future.   It is hoped that this will bt obviated ?;henthe adjoining building (the annexe to that occupied by theCrown Agents for the Colonies) becomes available.   ?lhenthe staff of the Statutory Committee is taken over thequestion of the re-arrangement of the accommodation willhave to be considered.June 23rd 1917M.N.

Committee for Scotland,Sir J. Collie further reported that wrest Park was notnow available,     A country house, or farm-colony was wanted asa convalescent home for Neurasthenics;   there would be cnougfcNeurasthenic cases for a home of from 50 to 100,     Dr. Bondthought there was a possible house at Bushey as to which hewould make inquiry.The Camp for Neurasthenic Soldiers in Bsnex had been takenup enthusiastically by Lieutenant Goulden.     Thirty- men hadbeen written to;   7 were going to Lord Montagu and a few tothe Duke of Marlborough;   the rest were to go to the Camp.There was a difficulty as to finance;   it was agreed that ifit came under Treatment or Training, payment could be made bythe Ministry;   Sir John Collie was of opinion that it wasdistinctly a place for Training, the men were there for thepurpose of being got back to work..     There might be somegratuity cases;   but they would all be attributable cases andtir. Horc expressed the opinion that. 57(1) cases came under theprovisions of $6 of the \larrant, in v/hich case there v/ould beno difficulty.     Wages would have to be set off against allow-ancos.   Usually Training was certified for by Local Committees;htit in these cases we should have to accept the Certificate ofthe Special Medical Board.     It was agreed that Mr. Hore shouldconsider the point and write to Sir John Collie,Buckhurst Manor, Uadhurst.     Sir John Collie reported thathe had visited it and found it unsuitable, heavy expenditurewould be necessary and even then it could not be successfullyadapted.The Spring, Hanwoll.     A proposal for the use of thisbuilding:was considered, and it was agreed that Sir John Collieshould visit it and if suitable, report for consideration.IToodbourne,     Sir A. Boscawen reported an interview withSir A. Keogh, which shewed that there was no sufficient needfor such a Homo for officers..     It might have been usefulfor
1 %1for Orthopaedic cases, for Officers, but they would bo betterdealt with at Croxbeth.     Sir w, Lawrence had advised MajorHamilton to pe.rcuado Mr, Leigh that it would be best to U3eit for Neurasthenic soldiers and sailors, and Major Hamiltonhad agreed to do so.Special Medical Board,     it had been decided that SirJohn Collie&apos;s Board should take the cases of NeurasthenicOfficers,     It was agreed to recommend that a letter should&apos;.&apos;&apos;v - &quot;,   &apos;   .: :be addressed to Sir John Collio, explaining how his Board candeal with the cases of men discharged before his Board wasconstituted, in order to bring them under the Military Service(Review of Exceptions) Act 1917.Hie question of Preliminary Expenses at Highfield wasconsidered on an application from Mr. Burleigh,   It wasdecided that the question of payment should be referred to theTreasury in accordance with the method approved at the lastmeeting and that the Ministry should be askod to take thenecessary action for this purpose.4, Epileptics,Dr. Bond read his report.   At Lingfield tenders had beenreceived for tho workshops and work was to be started nextMonday,     Plans for tho permanent Villas were under1 consideration, and would be ready for inspection at tho nextmeeting of the Committoe.Monyhull.     Sir A, Boscawen and Dr, Bond had had aninterviow with Mrs, Shakespeare and Mr, Curtis, and it wasproposed that they should visit Monyhull on 30th Juno,     Asubsequent letter from Fir, Curtis was read, stating that howould recommend his Committee to afford facilities for theaccommodation of from 40 to 45 discharged soldiers, suggestingan arrangement for the cost of maintenance and stating that hisChairman would support the scheme conditionally on theprovision of a capital sum equivalent to the cost of one ofthe
(4)184Adult Homes. This proposal was provisionally approved andSir A. Boscawon undertook to communicate with Mr. Curtis asto the proposed visit.Scotland.     Dr. Bond reported at length on tho needsand stated that Colonel J. Macpherson R.A.M.C, was preparedto give useful help.     The subject was,however, one for theScottish Institutional Committee, with whom Sir. A. Boscawenwould discuss it on the occasion of his forthcoming visit toScotland.Ireland.    Dr. Bond had soon Colonel W.R.Dawson, whov/as much in favour of an epileptic colony there, since therewas no such Institution in Ireland;   Colonel Dawson thought itshould be near Dublin.Forms of Admission.     The Superintendent at Lingfiolddesired that in every case   a   simple . form of applicationshould be signed;   it was agreed that this should be done by he Ministry of Pensions.     A simple form of questions was beingdrafted by tho authorities of Chalfont, Maghull and DavidLewis.The case of V.T.Phillips of Bristol was mentioned.     TheMedical Certificate supplied was insufficient as it did notshow the nature of the disease.     It v/as recommended that aletter should bo written to the Local Committee asking them toobtain a proper certificate from a qualified expert orphysician,Money Allowances to Epileptics.     Dr. Bond reported thatall Superintendents were extremely apprehensive as to more thantrivial sums being at the disposal of discharged soldiers intheir own hands.     Puller consideration was deferred to the nextmeeting.     Mr. Hore suggested a regulation that the sumallowed per week should be 5/- or such other sum as tho Ministerof Pensions approved on the advice of the Superintendent of theInstitution^

In order to deal with this problem the Minister ofahour is setting up Advisory Wages Boards in the principaltowns.    Any &quot;workman or employer in the district can obtainthe advice of. the Board as to the rate of wages which an indi-vidual disabled man should be paid for performing certainpecified work.    The Boards are instructed to have regard to thecurrent rate of wages for similar work in the district and to thecapacity of the man whose case they are considering to do suchoik.   They are not to have regard to any pension to which theman may be at the time entitled.     For further informationapply to the nearest Local War Pensions Committee or to thenearest Employment Exchange.The Placing oe Men in Employment.Applications for and on behalf of individual disabled menwishing to be trained, or from employers wishing to employ suchdisabled men after training, should be addressed either to theLocal War Pensions Committee or to the nearest Employmentxchange.THE CINEMATOGRAPH INDUSTRY.General Remarks.This industry comprises two distinct branches:  The pro-duction and distribution of films ; the presentation of the films.Under the first head are included the services of actors, scene-shifters, electricians, carpenters, propertymen, cameramen, menwho develop the films, salesmen, etc. Under the second head areincluded electricians, operators, musicians, doormen andattendants.Suitability eor Disabled Men.As most of these processes are not peculiar to the industry, andas they are covered by otfier Reports no further mention is made oftliem here. The work of operators, doorkeepers, and attendantsat Picture Theatres which affords good openings are dealt with indetail below.
(1) Operators and Operators&apos; Assistants.The worker needs the full use of both his arms and all hisfingers, though no strong grip pressure is required. It is anexcellent opening for men who have lost one leg, so long as theyare able to walk about, as the operator can sit down part of thetime. Several men have been already trained for this work whohave been injured in the leg or have had a leg amputated. Goodeyesight is essential, but good hearing is not. Some degree ofnervous strain is involved. The work is light in character, andis carried out under cover, where there is little dust, noise orvibration. In the larger Theatres the temperature in theoperator&apos;s box is almost normal, but if must be noted that in theolder types of Picture Theatres, and in some of the smaller modernones, the operators box is very small and the atmosphere veryclose and hot. Any man with a tendency to pulmonary diseaseshould not be sent to this type of theatre.(2) Doorkeeper.This is also work of a light character, performed partly indoorsand partly out of doors, and is admirably suited for men who arecertified by doctors to be fit only for light work, though it mustbe remembered that a man has to stand at the door in allweathers. In a small Theatre the doorkeeper might also berequired to do the cleaning, but in a larger Theatre his onlybusiness is to supervise others. A man with one arm or withoutthe use of most of his fingers could perform the work. In placingmen in this position who have been injured in the leg it must beremembered that a great deal of standing is involved.(3) Attendant.The work is mainly carried on indoors, but owing to the amountof bodily movement required a man injured either in the arms orlegs would be handicapped. At some Theatres both doormen andattendants assist in distributing window bills and posters.Training.(1) Operators and Assistants.In London a training centre solely for disabled sailors andsoldiers has been established since the beginning of the war.The man receives his electrical tuition at the Polytechnic, Regent.Street, and in some cases also at Roehampton, and his practicaltraining in a private Projection Theatre and Workshop (theCinematograph Training and Employment Bureau). - Experiencehas shown that an intelligent man of an adaptable nature, evenwithout previous knowledge of electricity or engineering, can insuch an intensive course be taught and placed as a first-classassistant operator in about twelve weeks. The practice of theschool has been to send a man on completion of his course to aPicture Theatre for a trial period of one month, where, if he
3 satisfactory, lie is ready at the end of a further period ofmonths to become a first-class operator.At the first meeting of the Trade Advisory Committee Mr.aul Kimberley, Director of the Cinematograph Training andmployment Bureau, was appointed Technical Advisor to thejmmittee upon methods of training, and it was recommendedhat additional training centres on the model of the Cinemato-raph Training and Employment Bureau in London should bestablished in Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool,anchester and Newcastle-upon-rTyne.oorkeepers and Attendants.No previous training is needed, but.a man requires to be steadyad responsible for either position.General Prospects.Operators and Operators&apos; Assistants.There are about 4,000 Picture Theatres in the UnitedKingdom, 60 per cent, of which employ one assistant as well asIE operator. The trade is rapidly growing, and it is anticipatedfiat the present shortage of workers will be felt also after thewar. There is little danger of competition for these posts, eitherfrom juveniles or from women, since local byelaws do not as aule allow young persons under 18 to take charge of themachines, while for various reasons the work is not suitable forwomen.(2) Doorkeepers and Attendants.The demand for reliable men is likely to be considerable.Doorkeepers are often promoted to be foremen, and in some casesassistant managers, or even managers of small Theatres.Maintenance During Training.Under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of the 29th March, 1917,an allowance of 27s. 6d. (more if he has been a non-commissionedofficer) is given to a disabled man while going through any courseof training approved by the Statutory Committee, with ad-ditional allowances for children at the rate of 5*. for the first,4s. 2d. for the second, 3*. 4d. for the third, and 2s. 6d. for eachsubsequent child; and if this training necessitates his living awayfrom home, and he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d.(more if he has been a non-commissioned officer) is given for hiswife, together with children&apos;s allowances at the rate mentionedabove. If he has supported any dependant up to the time whenhis training commenced, assistance will be given to that depen-dant. In addition to this any fees in respect of training will bepaid by the Minister, and at the end of it an amount equal to 5s.11283 B
for each, week the training lasted will be given to the man as abonus for satisfactory attendance.Wages.Electrician operators in large Theatres&apos; are paid up to  3 10$per week.

PREFACE:This report is one of a series which is being drawn up by tilEmployment Department of the Ministry of Labour in collaboStion with the War Pensions, etc., Statutory CommittalThe information is intended not only for the use of Local &quot;WlPensions Committees, Employment Exchanges, Technical SchoJand Institutes and Military Hospitals, but also for the use 1Employers and workpeople and any who are interested in tlproblem of the disabled sailor and soldier.Local War Pensions Committees are making enquiries as to tlTrades and industrial processes in their own areas which alespecially suitable for disabled men. This series of reports jconfined to trades which are to he found in every part of tlcountry or which cover a much wider area than that of any LociCommittee. The information collected for this report will, icourse, need to be supplemented by the more detailed knowledSwhich Local Committees have already in their possession or wflbe able to acquire with regard to their own local conditions.      jTrade Advisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers. Trade Advisory Committees have been set up by the Minist:of Labour in conjunction with the War Pensions, etc., Statute]Committee, to give advice upon some of the questions that affethe training and employment of disabled sailors and soldieiEach Trade Advisory Committee consists of an equal numberrepresentatives of employers and workpeople, and, in addition,representative of the Employment Department of the Ministof Labour and also of the War Pensions, etc., Statutory Coimittee, who attend the meetings in a consultative capaciwithout the right to vote.In the case of Tailoring (Wholesale and Retail) the Admintrative Committee of the Tailoring Trade Board is acting as tTrade Advisory Committee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers). TAdministrative Committee holds special sittings for this purpoat which only one &quot;of the appointed members, who actsChairman, attends, and at which employers and workpeople arepresented in equal proportions.This step has been taken with the concurrence of the Assoc:tions mentioned below, all of which are represented upon tlCommittee.Employers:The Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers&apos; Federation ;-The National Federation of Merchant Tailors;The Scottish Committee of the National FederationMerchant Tailors;The Master Tailors&apos; Federation.
Workpeople:The United Garment Workers&apos;&apos; Union;The Amalgamated Society of Tailors;The Scottish Operative Tailors.The functions of the Committee are as follows:  (a) To advise as to all questions that affect the reinstatementinto employment of disabled men formerly employedin the trade.(b) To make enquiries and to advise with regard to the&apos; possibility of the permanent employment of disabledmen not hitherto working in the Trade.(c) To report upon any schemes of training either in techni-cal institutes or in factories that may be necessary fordisabled men, whether formerly employed in the tradeor not, and to give advice as to suitable centresthroughout the country in which such training mightbe given.(d) To advise upon any general questions with regard to therate of wages to be paid to disabled men in the trade.This report has been placed before the Trade Advisory Com-littee and is issued with its sanction. Any questions thatrise with reference to this Report should be referred in the firstustance to the Trade Advisory Committee Branch (Disabled&apos;ailors and Soldiers), Employment Department, Ministry ofabour, Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, Tothill Street, Westminster,.W.1.Advisory Wages Boards.It is not intended that the Trade Advisory Committee, which iscentral body for the trade sitting in London, should deal withlie question of the wages which should be paid to individualisabled men taking into consideration the nature of theirisabilities.   In order to deal with this problem the Minister ofabour is setting up Advisory Wages Boards in the principal(owns.   Any workman or employer in the district can obtain theadvice of the Board as to the&apos; rate of wages which an individualdisabled man should be paid, for performing certain specifiedwork.   The Boards are instructed to have regard to the currentrate of wages for similar work in the district and to the capacityof the man whose case they are considering to do such work.They are not to have regard to any pension to which the man mayat the time be entitled.   For further information apply to the-nearest Local War Pensions Committee or the nearest Employ-ment Exchange.The Placing of Men in Employment.Applications for or on behalf of individual disabled men wishingto be trained or from employers wishing to employ such disabledmen after training should be addressed either to the Local WarPensions Committee, or to the nearest Employment Exchange.(11853r- 14a.)

RETAIL BESPOKE TAILORING.Description of the Trade.The bespoke tailoring trade is, so far as manufacture isconcerned, divided into two branches, viz.: (a) that one in whichthe garments are made on the premises or elsewhere by personsdirectly in the employment of the merchant tailor, and (b) that inwhich the garments are given out to be made up by a sub-con-tractor in his own workshop, or are sent to a wholesale factorywhich specialises in bespoke work.This section is concerned only with the first of these &quot;branches(a), and the difference in organisation between that branchand the wholesale bespoke branch (5) is accompanied as a ruleby important differences in the method of manufacture, whilethe system of working even within this branch varies. In somecases each garment (excluding the cutting and trimming) is madethroughout by one man on piece-work, or by a man paid weeklywages assisted by an apprentice. In other cases the work is clonein bespoke tailors&apos; workshops where women are being employedalong with men on the same garments. The women often do mostof the sewing and the machining, and the men the highly skilledparts and the pressing.General Prospects.There seems to be no doubt that there will be a fair prospectof employment for disabled men in this trade after the war.Even before the war employers failed to secure a sufficient supplyof good British journeymen tailors, and there is a consensus ofopinion among them that this difficulty was increasing. The&apos;oldsystem of apprenticeship was dying out, and the supply ofBritish journeymen failed to meet the demand. The result wasthat the making up of garments, at all events in London andmany of the large towns, was done to a very great extent by-foreigners of various nationalities.Chief Centres.Bespoke garments are made in every large and small town andin many villages, and the extent of the trade varies in accordancewith the population of the centre concerned.Suitability of the Work for Disabled Men.The work falls into two divisions (1) cutting, and (2)making-up.(1) Cutting. The cutter is the most important and the mosthighly-paid of tailors. He takes customers&apos; measurements,drafts the patterns, does the fitting-on, and supervises the sewingand making-up, and generally acts as foreman of the tailors&apos;workshop. A good knowledge of the work of a sewing tailor isconsidered indispensable, and most cutters have themselves risenfrom the ranks of the sewing tailors. A long training andextensive knowledge of the trade are required in most cases, and
is would seem to make the position unattainable by men withd tailoring experience, but it may be noted that^a man who hasheady been a sewing tailor would not be debarred, by the loss ofe or two fingers of his left hand, from filling a cutter&apos;s post,s a matter of fact, men thus disabled have already been trained&apos;th success as cutters.(2) Making-up. Here there&apos;would appear to be an excellentrospect for a partially disabled man, so long as he possessed theall use of both his hands with all his fingers and had good eye-[oht. The loss of one leg, or even both, would not be a seriousandicap; indeed there has always been among tailors a certainumber who were incapacitated by some injury to the legs. Thealy severe muscular exertion is in connection with the manipu-ation of a heavy iron used, in pressing. The work otherwise isjght and the conditions under which it is done in the workshopsre normal, there is no noise of machinery, no vibration, nostremes of temperature or of moisture or dryness in the air. Itould afford a very good opening for a young or youngish man,hough less suitable to men over thirty. The work is done eithern the private workshops which many of the firms engaged in thest class of work possess, or at the worker&apos;s own home, or inommon workshops conducted on a co-operative basis, in whichach tailor hires a &quot;sitting.&quot; For the highest class of workonsiderable experience and dexterity are essential. A first-rateailor is an artist, and there is much scope for individual taste andngenuity. -Each man must be able to make garments throughout and as aule, he specialises in one particular type, so that there are threeranches of the trade: (1) Coat-making; (2) Trousers-making; and3) Vest-making, which is often done by women.Wages and Hours oe Work.The work is skilled and the wages are good. A first-rate cuttert foreman tailor may be paid from 70s. to  10 per week accord-ug- to his ability. The average earnings of sewing tailors rangeroni 30s. to 55s. per week. The rates of payment for the variousrocesses for piece-workers are regulated in most of the best classmis, by agreements between the masters and the men, which areermed the &quot; log.&quot;.There are seasonal variations of trade. The Spring is generallyhe busiest season, whilst January, February, August and Sep-tember are slack months, but the irregularity is capable of beingreduced to some extent by a judicious arrangement of work.At a normally busy time a sewing tailor works 50 to 56 hours perireek, and a cutter about 50 hours.Length of Training Required.A thorough training is necessary, but the length of time wouldvary with the learners adaptability. A year in a technical school(luring the usual hours of day trade schools would provide a goodfoundation, and except in those sections of the trade in which:raftsmanship of a high order is required, a man would after-rards probably be qualified for employment that would yield a
living wage and should need no further maintenance allowancefrom the Ministry of Pensions. After introduction to the wortshop he would acquire the knowledge of details and the variedskill which lie heyond the range of a school. In London and inmany of the large towns, classes exist for the training of tailorsbut where such do not exist, arrangements could be made withthe Local Educational Authorities for the formation of suchclasses.A full time day training course in Tailoring has for some timepast been in existence at Regent Street Polytechnic, and a special12 months&apos; course of training for disabled sailors and soldiershas recently been established, with the concurrence of theAssociations of employers and workpeople concerned.This class has already been approved by the War Pensions,&amp;c, Statutory Committee, and arrangements are being made atthe Merchant Venturers&apos; Technical College, Bristol, to start acourse of a similar nature. It is suggested by the Trade AdvisoryCommittee (Disabled Sailors and Soldiers) that further trainingcentres be established in Glasgow, Leeds, and Manchester as anexperiment. If a further demand arise, it is suggested thattraining centres might also be established in Aberdeen,Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Plymouth.The following recommendations have been made by the TradeAdvisory Committee:  (1) That training be given in day trade training schools, for aperiod of 12 months for the hours customary in such schools.(2) That there be, in the case of each man accepted for training,a probationary period of four weeks, and that during the wholeperiod of training the man remain under continuous supervision.(3) That a syllabus of the training which should be given intraining schools be framed by the Trade Advisory Committee.(4) That Local Technical Committees, consisting of representa-tives of employers and workpeople in the trade, be appointed inconnection with each training centre to superintend the traininggiven.(5) That questions arising with regard to the wages ofindividual disabled men be referred to- the local Advisory WagesBoards, and that the Advisory Wages Boards should take stepsto secure the advice of persons familiar with and representativeof the trade.(6) That the Trade Advisory Committee be kept informed ofthe number of disabled men to be trained for the Tailoring Trade,and have power to impose restrictions ,on the training of anynumber in excess of that which the trade can reasonably heexpected to absorb.Maintenance during Training.Under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant of the 29th March, 1917,an allowance of 27s. Qd. (more if he has been a non-commissionedofficer) is given to a disabled man while going through any courseof training approved by the Statutory Committee, with additionalallowances for children at the rate of 5s. for the first, 4s. 2d. for
e second, 3s. 4d. for the third, and 2s. 6d. for each subsequentild, and if this training necessitates his living away from home,d he is married, a further allowance of 13s. 9d: (more if he hasen a non-commissioned officer) is given for his wife togetherith children&apos;s allowances at the rate mentioned above.   If heas supported any dependant up to the time when his trainingmmenced -assistance will be given to that dependant.   In addi-on to this any fees in respect of training will be paid by theinister, and at the end of it an amount equal to 5s. for eacheek the training lasted, will be given to the man as a bonus foratisfactory attendance.The Employment Department of the Ministry of Labour isspecially indebted to Mr. J. C. Eaton, Junior, for his assistancen the preparation&apos; of this report.The remaining, branches of the tailoring trade, i.e., wholesalebilling and sub-contracting, will be dealt with in a later report.*
APPENDIX VI.Circular No. 50.Local Committees.TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED MEN.War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee,22, Abingdon Street,Westminster, S.W. 1.19th June, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee to refer toSection 4 (f) of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c, Act, 1915, by whichLocal Committees have been entrusted with the care of disabled men after theyhave left the Service, including provision for their training and employment.The Statutory Committee desire that the men should be restored as far as possibleto ordinary industry; and they suggest that, in preparing schemes for training,industries should be avoided which are semi-philanthropic in character and forthe products of which there is no general demand.The Local Committees should make enquiry as to which are the leadingindustries in their areas, and also as to which of them are likely to expand andabsorb additional men after the war. The present conditions of industry are, ofcourse, abnormal, and it is extremely important to have regard to probable post-war conditions rather than to those existing at the present moment.The Statutory Committee would point out that the Census Returns show theaumbers of men employed in each place in particular industries, and give, anindication of the extent of the various trades in each area. It may be expectedthat, generally speaking, trade will eventually return to something like pre-warchannels, and I am therefore directed to enclose the accompanying extract fromthe Census Returns, which shows some of the occupations in which a considerablenumber of men were employed in the area of the Local Committee in 1911 whenthe Census was taken. It is intended that this extract should only be regardedas a general guide, showing what were before the war the occupations in whichlarge numbers of men were employed. In some cases, trades in which the menwere employed may have been over-stocked, and in others, though the occupationis suitable for the employment of disabled men, it may not be such as necessitatesany considerable degree of skill or requires a course of training. In large industries,however, there are likely to be special branches where considerable skill is requiredfor which training could be given.It is hoped to continue the series of reports drawn up by the Ministry of Labour,in collaboration with the Statutory Committee, upon the processes of industrysuitable for the training of disabled men. Where Trade Advisory Committees ofemployers and employed have been appointed, the reports will be submitted beforeissue to the Committee concerned for their consideration. Each of these Committeesdeals with a particular industry, and is concerned with questions affecting thatindustry throughout the whole country, while the Local Committees, with repre-sentatives of employers and employed among their number,^ are, of course, familiarwith the special problems of industry in their own areas. If it had been possible,the reports on the various industries would have been issued together; but thenecessary enquiries must occupy much time, and it has been thoughtdesirable to place the information in respect of each industry at the disposal ofLocal Committees so soon as it is complete. When a considerable number of thereports have been issued, it is hoped that Local Committees will find that theyhave valuable information from the national point of view about most of theprincipal industries. Local Committees should, however, remember that. theindustries in their own areas must always receive their first attention.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,E. A.

TheDisablements Sub-Committee are very anxious  or some definitescheme regarding training and are awaiting information on thispoint from the Northern Joint Disablement Committee.TINEMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE.The administration of this Local Committee io greatlyimproved especially regarding Advances, Recoveries etc., fromPaymasters.     Two members have been nominated to the NorthernJoint Disablement Committee, who will co-operate as far aspossible regarding the training and treatment of disabled men.As regards the Regulations Parts I and II, the work is beingcarried out quite satisfactorily.AlstonBootleBramptonCockermouthCunberland WardKeswickLongtownMarytownPenrithAllerdale-above-DerwentAllerdale-below-DerwentWorkington (Rural) 15 8 If) 10 8 6 13 17 20 17 5
CARLISLE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Carlisle City Local Committee is short of staff andthe War Pensions work is rather neglected in consequence.     Thefollowing recommendations were made by the Inspector\-(1)   That the Disablement Sub-Committee be appointed at once;(2)   That a Sub-Committee be started to deal with SeparationAllowances under Part II;    also a Sub-Committee to deal withPart I Regulations.Very few oases under Part II have been assisted, notmore than 28 per week, while the population of Carlisle is60,000.Regarding Disabled Soldiers, nearly 200 notificationshave been received but no action seems to have been taken.     TheCharity Organisation Society has a most efficient branch inCarlisle and our Inspector cuggests that they should be appointedby the Local Committee as a Visiting Committee;   he understandsthat they wftuld be v/illing to undertake the work.GRB5N0CK LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work of this Local Committee is largely done by aCommittee of ladies at the office of the local Branch of theSoldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families * Association.     They have voluntaryfundo at their disposal and appear to give assistance where itis needed, from&apos; one source or another.The Regulations are well adhered to and the ladiesconcerned deal with the applications in a Judicious manner.DISABLEMENTS BRAITOH.Report of the Training Section.The scheme for training submitted by the Aberdeen^ LocalCommittee has been considered.     The Commercial course at theBoard School and Technical College has been sanctioned providedthat it does not exceed six months in length, that only men,whose education has reached a certain standard, are trained, thatthey are given a thorough commercial training, and that onlyspecially selected men are taught foreign languages andaccountancy.     The course in Engineering has been approved.   Thecourse in Architecture has been approved in the case- of such menas may be considered specially suitable for employment a3architects1 assistants or builders&apos; clerks.

The course in Art work has beenapproved provided that a definite opening for employment isassured for each man before the training is begun.     The course-in Cooking has been approved on the understanding that it willbe mainly confined to men who intend to become ships cooks.
Approval has be ,n given to tho course in Agriculture providedthat each man is interviewed by the Principal of the Collegebefore the training is begun and that the latter is satisfiedthat the candidate io suitable.     It has also been decided towarn the Local Committee that there will probably be few openingsfor wireless operators after the war and to request themvtoexercise extreme oautlon in arranging for men to undergo thecourse of training in Wireless Telegraphy, sanctioned &quot;by theStatutory Committee in February, 1917,     The Local Comiaittee havebeen informed that the duration of any course shouldnormally extend over 26 weeks, that fees should not exceed7/6 per man per week and that where Local Associations ofEmployers&apos; and Workpeople exist in any given trade their approvalshould be obtained before men are trained in the Industryconcerned.The classes in Mechanical Engineering at the Cowden-beath Mining School submitted by the Pifeshire Local Committeehave been approved provided that the course extends over sixmonths, and that each man admitted to the classes is given generaltraining in mechanical work, and not in one process only.     TheLocal Committee have been informed that the total cost of train-ing should not exceed 7/6 per head per week and that they shouldsatisfy themselves before any course Is begun that the LocalTrades Unions concerned 7/ill not offer objections to the scheme.The course of Training in Basket-making proposed by theDublin Local Committee has been sanctioned on oondition that afull report is furnished in respect of each man so trained bothas to his eligibility and as to the results of the training.Sanction ha3 been given in nine cases to th.; trainingof individual men and further information has been requested inrespect of 34 other cases.PENSIONS BRANCH.Of the individual cases considered during the weekthere is none which calls for special comment.TNAHCE. .       3.    d *Amount advanced to Local Committees    - 8,480.   0.   0.Other expenditure -Temporary Grants 48,   0.   0.Salaries and Wages 472.    1.    9.Miscellaneous 2.   2.   0.Purchase of  60,000in 3 months TreasuryBills. 49,452. 16.
