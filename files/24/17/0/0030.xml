The Admiralty appear to he working on the followinglines.I, Vessels to and from a particular port must ofnecessity follow a definite route as they enter orleave that port eog* vessels entering or leavingLondon must do so by the Thames, and most of thesevessels must pass through the Downs.II, That it is desirable to extend these definiteroutes so as to keep the vessels as long as possibleunder protection e.g,(a) There Is to be a definite route from orto Scilly for vessels entering or leaving(on voyages through the Mediterranean andSouth atlantic) London, or other EastCoast Ports *(b) There are to bo definite routes from or toPastnet for vessels entering or leaving(on lorth Atlantic voyages) London orother East Coast Ports, the Bristol Channel. Ports or Liverpool.(c) There are to be definite routes from or toTory Island for Vessels entering or leavingLiverpool (iSforth about) or Glasgow,III, That so that these definite routes may be usedthroughout it is necessary to concentrate on theocean point from which the definite route starts, orto dispense from the ocean point at which the routeends e0g.Scilly for 3oute AfcPastnet for Route B.Inishtrahull for itoute C.2&apos; It follows that the above practice involves:-Pirst      Concentration on, or dispersing from, theocean termination of the given route.Second    Adherence to the- given route,3- It is submitted that the above practice can only bejustified by the extent of the protection which theAdmiralty can guarantee whilst the vessels, are:-ffirst      Concentrating on or dispersing from theocean termination of the given route.
Second      Proceeding on the given route.4* To enable the extent of this protection to begauged the following illustrations are taken from ihelosses iir the months of April and May 1917, of oceangoing British Steamships of 1,600 tons gross and upwards.5. In these illustrationsRoute A*	is	the	route to and from Sollly.Area A.	is at	the the	area in v*hich the vessels concentrate ocean termination of Route A..Route B,	is	the	foute to and from FastnetArea B.	is at	the the	area in which the vessels concentrate ocean termination of Route B.Route 0.	is	the	route to and from,Tory Island.Area C.	is at	the the	area in which the vessels concentrate ocean termination of Route C.The actual route to be followed may be varied fromtime to time, but the Admiralty practice is based onprotecting a definite route from or to the named points.In the same way the Areas of ooncontration may bevaried from time to time, but here again the Admiraltypractice of necessity leads to concentration at the oceanterminations of the defined Routes.Route a.

The above records of losses in the month of April andMay 1917 may be summarised as under:-LJLJL	Bl	R S		C. lilLosses on Route		0.5	5	Losses in Areas of		20	47	11concentration		.35 -	52	11T 0 E I A G	E	/t -	OSS	Losses on Route	A. 73., 898		Bo 19,100	0.

These records show that the Admiralty has beensomewhat more successful in protecting the Routes than the^reas of ConcentrationaOn the Routes the points.which in particular call forexplanation would appear to be:-Route A.   5 vessels lost off Beachy Head.Route B.   3 vessels lost off Minehead, Faterford.11. The losses in the Areas of Concentration prove thateither the Admiralty1s theory is &quot;unsound in principle, orthat in practice the force employed hes been entirelyinadequate to afford protection.The losses in area B are appalling.   In the two monthsthe number- of vessels lost on the principal courses to andfrom the Fastnet were as under:--    lumber of Course from Greatest distancevessels lost Fastnet from Fastnot atwhich a lossoccurredo7 JsoY/tf 240 miles15 -    SoT,o by X: 250     &quot;7 &quot;IJJ, 230     TT18   . Other courses 270     &quot;,17 -12. Tha area between &quot;the bearings HSi and */J.. w fromthe Fastnet ^-^ which the 29 vessels were lost in the twomonths forms &quot;a cone containing/about 10,5^0 square miles.In this limited area the vessels were concentrated underAdmiralty directions and it was in this Area that theywere destroyed by the Enemy.13, The losses in the other Areas A and C* were, havingregard to the smaller number of vessels concentrated onthose areas., almost as disquieting.
14. The records.for the first three weeks of the present ^month are not yet available hut the serious losses areagain occurring within the Areas of Concentration.15, It is idle to imagine that the British lavy cannotprovide a sufficient force of Destroyers and Patrol Vesselsto guarantee against submarines the reasonable safety ofan area of 10t000 or 20,000 square miles, within from 200to 300 miles of convenient ports.The Admiralty has apparently failed to realise thatfrom the Haval point of view the principal battle front isnow off the -\.-est Coast, of Ireland.    There is not muchapparent glory to be obtained from the negative victory ofkeeping the submarines down.    There is no such Publiccriticism over the loss of the Merchant Seamen, whose shipsare sent to the bottom in the Areas of Concentrationselected by the Admiralty, as there is over the lives lostin an attack on an East Coast. town-.   But the lives of theseamen and the safety of the ships and their cargoes areof far greater importance for the purposes of winning ther/ar than the lives of the people on shore and the houseproperty in the East Coast town.16. The Areas Of Concentration are traps and nothing else -so long as they arenato adequately protected.17. If the Admiralty will not give the necessary protectionother means can and must be devised for bringing the vesselsin reasonable safety on to the Routes..18. We are now fast using up our. last reserves of oceancarrying power,We are concentrating our ships on the North AtlanticTrade - the most dangerous trade from the point of view ofthe submarines.We go on playing with the rebuilding programmes.Action must be taken at once to stop this throwingaway of ships in unprotected Areas of Concentration-(Signed)   I0RMI HILL .21st June, 1917MOTE-&quot; ,     A COPY OP THE 4BOVE HAS BEEN SEIT TO SIR EDWARD CARSONAMD SIR JOHN JELL10OK POR THEIR INFORMATION.(Intd.)
