WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. IX.June 19, 1917.Party Politics.This week there is a complete lack of any fresh news as tothe political situation.   This is the more regrettable as thereseems little doubt that there are important under-currents atwork in party politics in Iasi which will determine the politicalfuture of Rumania.In the discussion of the character and aims of the new LabourParty in last week&apos;s Report three possible explanations of itsattitude were set forth at some length.   Such little news as I haveheard since then confirmB the view that it is the second of thesethree explanations which is probably the correct one.   ProfessorIorga has now left the party, and it looks as though he has cometo the conclusion that the new party is not likely to play astraightforward role in the Reform Movement.    Iorga himself,though somewhat doctrinaire and self-assertive and swayed bypersonal likes and dislikes (among the latter being his dislike ofMr Take Ionescu), is perfectly honest and has a genuine enthusiasmfor the cause of reform and a genuine admiration for and sympathywith the peasant population of the country.Before long it should be possible to throw a little more lighton the character of the new party, its relations with the Governmentand its bearing on the whole Reform Movement.Information about the German Occupation of Wallachia.The Berlin Correspondent of the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant,to whose despatches I referred last week, continues his
descriptions of conditions in Wallachia in this newspaper.Bucarest, though it has lost its &quot;social veneer&quot; and is franklya conquered town, is, according to him, perfectly happy and well-looked after.   For instance, the bread ration is almost doublethat in Germany.   Many of the upper classes have fled, but thebulk of the population is quite content to stay on.   He saysthat the German, Austrian, and even Turkish officers and soldiersare quite popular and universally admired.   The only strongfeeling is aroused by the Bulgars, whose officers have taken overthe Cafe Capsa, the most fashionable cafe in Bucarest,   This theydid   intentionally as an insult to the Rumanians, for Cafe Capsarepresents &quot;the cradle of Rumanian politics&quot;.   Many Rumaniansoldiers are to be seen about in uniform and even officers;some of them are employed in factories and on the land, and theyare allowed to wanders about almost freely, like the internedBelgians in Holland.   The Correspondent goes on to describeconditions in the country and the wretched life of the peasant,which appears to him. more miserable even than that of thepopulation of Russian Poland.In another article he describes the thoroughness with whichthe petroleum fields were laid waste by the British andRumanian officers charged with the duty, and declares that every-where, except at Campina, the wells rare almost totally destroyed.The Germans have a hard task in re-starting the production ofpetrolj   however, thanks to the skill of some of the officersin their army who had   previously worked as engineers on thesevery petroleum fields, they have already resumed production on asmall scale, and during the past month the daily productionreached 450 tons and before long should be much greater.The Correspondent declares that the German authorities arevery friendly to the Dutch population in Rumania, who representpractically the only neutrals now.   He complains, however, tKat
they are unable to send or receive letters from Holland, asRumania is totally cut off from any postal communications, exceptthe military posts.   He. puts in a strong plea that theseregulations should be relaxed in favour of these Dutchmen.A.W.A.L.19.6.17
