&apos; REPORT     OH     G^JAilY-June 11th to June 16th. 1917*Several events have recently taken place which indi-cate clearly- the line which is being taken by the German Govern-inent.     We have first the speech by pz. Solf on the necessity ofa German Colonial Ijnepire-j which was referred to in. last week&apos;sreport;   secondly, the publication of the proposals mrde byScheidemann and the llajority socialists st Stockholm;   thirdly,peace offers oade to ivussic. from Germany through a Swiss inter-. mediary, sad, fourthly, further discussion about Alsece-Iorr&amp;ine-I. Solf*s statement about the Colonies is generallytaken as indicating the decision of the Government;   it has beenwell received, and&apos;in consequence, there is a concentration inthe Gersurn press on the colonial question;   while there is severe^ criticism, there is a general agreement that a Colonial iimpirein Africa is necessary for Germany.    As the Vossisohe : eituaKsays:-&quot;Ve want a solid Colonial Empire in Central Africa, toinclude the.Cameroons, the Congo, Portuguese West Africa,German South West end East Africa, and portions of Portu-guese East Africa and Rhodesia.    These&quot;territories comprisewhat we need.    They comprise a solid colonial empire whichwill satisfy our wishes.&quot;JSven Reventlow is satisfied, though he wants Belgium as well.A similar programme is put forward by ProfessorDelbrttck in the June number of the Preussisohe Jahrbtioher:   hewas writing before Solfs speech was- msde, but we may assume thathis article was written after discussing with Solf;   the two havet   muoh in common.    All that he says is worth reading, as he is oneof the coolest political observers in Germany, end though a strong
Conservative and militarist, is honest and, at any rate in peacetime, is independent of the Government.     He writes on the assump-tion of a German victory:-   &quot;It is not a peace of reconciliationthat we muet aim at, also not a peace dictated by power (Macht-frieden), hut a German peace, a peace of our national future.&quot;he argues that the important thing for such a peace is not acqui-sition of territory in -lurope; &quot;but colonial esrjansion.    Russiais fto longer to be feared and colonial possessions aa?e preferableto &quot;Belgium:&quot;V/here lies the great aim that we set before ourselves, orlet us say rather, the great wish, the fulfilment of whichwe must work for if the final victory is panted to us?   Itcan lie nowhere else except beyond the sea.   The greater ourvictory, the greater must&quot;be our Colonial lanpire.     If webrought England so far down, be it by victories on land, beit by submarine warfare, that, notwithstanding the help ofAmerica, she gave up the continuation of the war and waswilling to - -rant us a direct or indirect control over Bel-gium, still we should have to say, not Belgium, but Africa;not the coal basin of Charleroi, but Nigeria;   not Zeebrugge,but the Azores, Kadeira and the Cape Verde Islands.    iTotAntv/erp, but lagos, Zanzibar and Uganda, and Gibraltar forSpain.    Hot commercial advantages by forced commercialtreaties, but indemnities in cash or in raw material.* Honeof Germany&apos;s Allies have anything to gain by the acquisitionof Belgium by Germany, but a great German Colonial ^ra;.drein Africa would be an advantage both to Turkey and to Austria.Hungary&quot;If our victory is great enough, we can hope to unite inour hands the whole of Central Africa with our old South-Vest, Senegambia, Sierra-leone, the Gold Coast, Dahome, thepopulous iligeria with the harbour of lagoe, Cameroon, theuseful islands of Sen Thome&quot; and Principe, Preach and BelgianCongo, rich Angola with its splendid harbours, the richterritory of Katanga, Horth-Rhodesia, lyassa-iand, Mozambiquewith Belagoa Bay, Madagascar, German East Africa, Zanzibar,Uganda;   also the large harbour of Pohta Delgado on theAzores, one of the most important and most visited coalingstations, and Horta one of the principal centres of the trans-atlantic telegraph cable.    In-the Atlantic Ocean there arevery few spots, the position of which is of such eminentgeographical importance for commerce, politics and navalstrategy as the Azores;   as soon as they fall into the handsof a Great Power, which possesses a strong fleet.    Todaythey belong to Portugal, which is at war with us.    ToPortugal Velong also the Cape Verde Islands with the harbourof Porto Grande, one of the most frequented stations in theEastern Atlantic.....&quot;V.ill the English consent to our gaining so great a colon-ial empire?   I hope they&quot;will have to, and, with the choiceof giving over to us these colonies or permitting our direct
or indirect rule over Belgium, they will gladly leaveus the Colonial Empire.&quot;The object of all this is obvious;    By puttingbefore the German Chauvinists these great prospects outsideEurope, the Government and Government writers are educatingthem to agree to the surrender of their hopes of annexationsor growth of strength in Europe.     Probably for the momentthis is the chief aim.    The Government are doin^ ell theycan to get an understanding with Kussia;   for this they areforced to accept the formula &quot;pease without annexation&apos;&apos;;for this purpose they are using the bocialists, but in orderthat this move may be successful, they must stop the constantdemands for European annexations.     This can only be done byoffering extensive hopes of this kind outside Europe.These wide colonial plans are then an essentialpart of the whole scheme in which beheidemann is playing animportant role.    He has now left Stockholm, but beforedoing so, his proposals were formulated and published; andthey show how useful to Germany the Russian formula may be.He and his colleague; Pr. jjavid, have already com-pletely identified themselves with the German Government as tothe origin of the war.    David has at Stockholm repeated andmaintained in the strongest way the view that no speoi&amp;Xblame attaches to the German Government;   the blame must besought among all the Governments, but among thera, it is theEnglish and the Russian autocracy that is especially guilty.This is supported by the most recent German interpretationsas to the course of events immediately preceding the outbreakof - the war.    There must then be no recriminations, noreparation.Scheidemann, in his proposals, demands an agreedpeace, no annexations, no indemnities, the restoration of
oonquered territories and Colonies,    The formula :,no annexa-tion and no indemnities&quot; is so interpreted that Germany -:ndAustria shell lose nothing.     On the other hand huivsia will belimitsweakened;   Po3.and is to he independent, but the aoaagc of the^independent Poland are those determined by the Congress ofJTienna, i.e. no territoiies now belonging to Austria orGermany are to be included in it;   $inland is to be autonomous(it is not clear whether autonomy means independence).    Thoseterritories in Germany, which are not German-speakin.;., ere tobe.granted &quot;cultural autonomy&quot;, i.e. they are to continue asintegral parts of Germany with the ri;bt to use their Danish,Polish or French languages      On the other lund &quot;Ireland, Egypt,Tripoli, Moroooo, India, Thibet and Cores, should have allsympathy from socialists in their aspirations tor national&quot;Independence&quot;.    The question of Alsace and Lorraine is treat-el at some length, with the conclusion that there is no claimfor their separation from Germany,     (The question of Alsace-Lorraine will be discussed in a separate report).There follow on this a number of clauses dealingwith the amelioration of national relations after the war,the establishment of an international tribunal, reduction ofarmaments, definition of contraband, etc    Amons these isincluded &quot;no commercial wet shall be declared after this war&quot;.T&amp;is. is important because, if accepted, it would remove thatwhich the Germans most fear, continued restrictions of theirtrade.l*he consideration of these proposals justifies theclaims being made for Scheidemann by his friends, that be mustbe regarded above all as a German patriot.    It will be seen atonce that a peace made on terms such as &quot;these would leave Ger-many with complete control over her present allies.    Austria-Hungary and Turkey would come out of the war with undiminished
-territory and it may be noted that while he supports theright to independence of Egypt, Ireland, Tripoli, India, hehas not a word to say ebout Armenia or Arabia or Syria,     &apos;i&apos;heGerman position would then be secured, but the frontiers ofKussia, by the surrender of Poland (on this point see below)would be removed Bast ,-nd we should get a German CentralEurope without even that check which hitherto a strong RussianMonarchy has implied.     The whole conception is one in com-plete accordance with that which is now bein^ industriouslyspread in the official end semi-official press in Germany;it aims at German domination in Eastern Europe, peace withRussia to be followed, if possible,by a good understanding,and the point of this powerful conglomeration is avowedlydirected against England and what is called British Imperial-ism.     Articles have appeared in the Kdlnische Zeitung strong-ly advocating an eventual alliance with Russia and Japan asthe best way of breaking up the British Empire.     It is im-posBible any longer to doubt that kerr Scheidemenn h. s beenacting - as the KBlnisohe Zeitung stated - as the directagent of the German Government, and has been helping theirplan of using the vague and ill-informed pacifism of theRussians to enable Germany to come out of the war with herpower not only unimpaired, but relatively strengthened.If we want to give the real meaning of a Scheide-mann peace we must turn to a remarkable letter by PaulGoehre, which appears in Die Hllfe, Neumann&apos;s paper.    He isprotesting against the charge that Soheidemann is not apatriotic German;   he olaims that Scheidemann is a much betterpatriot than the Pan-Germans, and that the peace which he istrying to get is one which will bring great increase ofpower to Germany, and go far to destroy the power of England,which is the real enemy of Germany.
&quot;The demand for a peace without annexations impliesthe restoration not only of the lands taken by the CentralPowers, but also of those conquered by the Entente.For England, however, our bitterest and real enemy, thatmeans the destruction ox its new world policy which in-cludes whole continents.....! peace without annexationsnot only tears assunder this  cigantic net, but in con-junction with the new war factor of the submarine, bringsEngland to the end of her previous monopoly in sea power.What the Central Powers have to give up is comparativelyimmeasurably less..     They surrender some districts whichwould always have remained foreign elements in the State,they win the mass of a Mittel liurppa spread over theBalkans and South West &quot;Asia&quot;, &quot;from Hhe lorfh &quot;Sea&quot;go thePersian Gulf, aild fetain an&apos;Affici:.n Coloniai&quot;Empire,which, in the coming period of diminished internationaltrade, will have the greatest value for them.......Inpassing it must be said, just in the matter of theGerman Colonies, the war has produced a complete changeof opinion amon;% the Social Democrats.     The maintenanceof the German frontiers means for them also at the sametime the maintenance of our Colonial possessions, eitherin their previous form or in a new one, though certainlynot in one of diminished value....To gain peace withoutannexations means also the possibility of an approach ofthis enlarged Mittel-Europa to a Eussia which has beeninternally changed&apos;, and finally, even an alliance withher.     T/e must decide whether we wish to get an under-standing with England or Russia.     Rather we have al-ready decided;   the overwhelming majority of the peopleconsiders that the only possible understanding is theone to the East.&quot;From what I hcve been saying, it will be quiteclear that the peace policy of Social Democracy hasarisen from the ..^unJat^ion of thaj^jT^cjffl^rehejision ofGerman interests.   &quot; It &quot;is&quot; &quot;not (as &quot;the Deutsche Tages-zeitung daily says) the result of international prole-tariat considerations.   Not only for me c,nd my more in-timate companions is it that this German interest comesexclusively into consideration;   the overwhelming major-ity of the Social Democrat Majority Party thinks^now aswe do.     This shows better than anything their presentnational German character.     The separation of the Inde-pendent Socialists has only made this character clearer.For this separation is the liberation of the party fromthose elements which hitherto placed the internationalabove the national principle, as they placed the revolu-tionary above the evolutionary&quot;.It could not be more clearly stated that Scheide-mann and his friends have lost all claim to speak on behalfof those principles of international socialism which theirparty was established to maintain      There are many who willbelieve that their new doctrineB are preferable to their old,but it is no longer possible for them to win support for thepurely nationalist policy which they put forward on the
grounds thct in doing so they represent the traditional4        principles of Social Democracy.We have not yet any information as to the effectof these proposals on public opinion in Germany.     The newsthat comes from Stockholm shows that, as might have teen anti-cipated, they will destroy any influence which Scheidemannmight claim there as the genuine representative of socialistopinion.     It is to he expected in fact that Herr Scheidemannwill have overreached himself.    He is certain to he verybitterly attacked by the Minority Socialists;   the split inthe party will become wider and it is difficult to see whatfuture there will be for the Majority Socialists except thatwhich has overtaken all Liberal parties in Germany who haveever allowed themselves to become allied with the PrussianGovernment.     The moral oi the whole situation has been welldrawn .by the Journal de Geneve;   an article of June 9th onImperial Socialists, ends as follows:-&quot;The obvious aim of the Germans is to aggravate theweakness (caused by the Russian Revolution), to spread theimpression that with good will the peoples are on the eveof a common understanding, that it is the criminal obstin-aoy of the Governments alone which prolongs the massacre,which has henceforward no object-     Germany who, as the;Chancellor affirms in every one ox his speeches, has sincethe 1st August, 1914, merely been carrying on a defensivewar, happily does not belong to this category.   Thus, inthe Entente the will to action will be weakened;   it i&amp;not the Entente which will hold out for the last quarterof an hour - that which gives the victory.&quot;But when this result has been obtained, as Boon as theday comes, the Imperial Government will call in again itsown Socialists, so respectful of authority, and as desirousas anyone of a fruitful German jjeace.     It will jrive themfor the time a holiday, for it is not they, but the diplo-matists who will make the treaty - if it is not, as it wasin 1871, the soldiers.    And the victims will be, not onlythe neighbouring nations gone over tb Germanism and itsallies, but all European democracies, including of coursethe new-born republic which the talkers of Patrograd in-spire or paralyse.&quot;3- There has also been published a message sent toRobert Grimm, the Swiss Social Pacifist, from M. Hoffmann,member of the Swiss Federal Council.     This message, which
144^   There are important variations in other versions, butthis is probably the correct version-is quoted by the &quot;Times&quot; is as follows :-&quot;Germany will not undertake an offensive so long as sheconsiders it possible to arrive at an understanding with   &apos;Russia.     Numerous conversations with prominent politicianslead me to believe that Germany is seeking to conclude withRussia a mutually honourable pe: ce end a peace which wouldresult in the re-establishment oi close economic and commer-cial relations with Russia;   the financial support of Ger-many to Russia for her restoration;   no intervention in theinternal affairs of Russia;   a friendly understanding withregard to Poland, Lithuania and Courland;   the restorationto Russia of her occupied territories, in return for thedistricts of Austria invaded by Russia.     I am convincedthat if the Allies of Russia desired it, Germany and herallies would be ready immediately to open peace negotiations&quot;This, which was not intended for publication, con-firms what has been clear for long, that the German Governmentis doing everything in their power to bring about an under-standing with Russia;   the details as regard Courland andLithuania, which are very remarkable, are dealt with in thereport of the Polish Section.     It may be noticed that thisoffer of peace is not, ft any rate at present, for a separatepeace with Russia, but that the Russian Allies are included.This is clearly good tactics.     The German Government therebyavoids the suggestion that they are asking Russia to commitan act of treachery and desert her Allies;   what they aredoing is to use the Russian conception for opening generalnegotiations;   Herr Scheidemann1s proposals, as has beenpointed out, show how they would interpret the Russian formulaAll this is in complete accordance-with the viewthat the German Government are extremely anxious to get peaceas soon as possible and, if their overtures are rejected, willuse every effort to throw the responsibility upon GreatBritain rather than on France.    Attention must be drawn tothe manner in which M. Ribotfs declaration and the decisions
of the Chamber as to Alsaee-Lprraine Lave &quot;been received.While there is a quite unanimous voice, including even theSocialists, that the surrender of Alsace-Lorraine is eonnlete-ly out of the question, there has been no attempt to work up,as might so easily have &quot;been done, a great storm of indigna-tion against French arrogance.    The line teken on the wholehas been one rather of regret,       many of the papers say thatthe vote of the Chamber does not really represent the feelingof the people;   they do not wish that the moral indignation,which is being stirred up against British Imperialism, shouldbe weakened by some of it being devoted to France.The question will be asked whether suggestions suchas that made by writers such as Delbrtlck, that Germany mayhope for a peace on such favourable terms that she will beable not only to regain her own colonies, but to increase hercolonial possessions, really represents their own belief.Of course we cannot expect to find in any published statementtheir real views as to military prospects.     As to war onland, the papers reiterate with wearisome insistency thatevery offensive made by the English has resulted in failure.It is easy enough to do this, lor they always represent theobjective of the English to have been to break througfe theline;   as the line has not in fact been broken through, theyare able to insist that the objective was not attained, thatthe German resistance continues to be unbroken and thatattacks only result in a useless expenditure of life *o theattacking party.    V/c nay assume that the German commandknows that this is untrue;   probably the military writersin the press also know, and we may also assume that theGerman soldiers know that it is untrue.     How far the Germanpeople are deceived, we cannot say;   for that we shouldrequire communications from private individuals;   unfortunate-
ly we receive very few of these and our knowledge of what isgoing on in Germany, apart from published sources, is verydefective.4t As to the submarine warfare, the line taken varies.&apos;Je hear less than we did mt of the hope that England wouldsoon be completely overcome and forced by starvation to suefor peace.    Herr von Heyderbrand, a prominent ConservativeLeaderj said recently on the authority of a German admiral:&quot;We are convinced that in at least two months England&apos;sposition will be such that she must yield&quot;, but he has beenseverely criticised for doing so, among others by Reventlow.The general belief seems to be that the accumulated loss offood and other material will eventually be so serious as toaffect the supplies of the army in France, that militaryefficiency will thereby be diminished, and this v/ill bringEngland to see that it is no good going on and dispose themto a peace by agreement.Everything therefore combines to show that it ison a peace by agreement in the Scheidemann sense, that thehopes of the German Government are at present based.5. We hear of a very active propaganda being carriedon against a Scheidemann peace;   in particular it is stated 1that pamphlets protesting against it are being distributedby officers in the army.     The essential point at issue is therelinquishment of all control over Belgium and the FlemishCoast.     So far as it is possible to judge, the mass andintelligence of the nation are at present against the extrem-ists, who still maintain the exaggerated demands which werecommon at the beginning of the war.     The change in themilitary situation, and other causes, have brought about agreat change in public opinion.
If the orertures to Russia and the Stockholm^proposals fail, the position of the Government may howeverbecome very difficult, for this would mean the failure of theattempt which the Chancellor has undoubtedly been making toget what might be described as a German peace by negotiation.The fiesult of such a failure would be to increase the in-fluence of the extremists on both sides, the Pan-Germans andthe Minority Socialists;   in this case it might be that thesituation would get out of the control of the Government.Attention should be drawn to articles that haveappeared in more than one paper suggesting that the Englishare contemplating a violation of Dutch neutrality.    This maybe pure speculation of a kind which is very common in militarym&amp;ttfars among German writers, but we cannot altogether excludethe hypothesis that these4 are being written to prepare theway for some similar move by the Germans themselves.J. W. H.19th June, 1917.
