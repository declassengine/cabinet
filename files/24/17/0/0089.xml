The Chief of the

General Staff,

War Office, London.

I have the following to report in regard to the Russian Artillery in the Field.

During the month of May, the Russian Artillery in the various Armies on the Northern, South Western and Roumanian fronts have been visited by me or Lt. Col. FINLAYSON.

A distinct improvement is noticeable from what I saw and from the reports of Lt. Col. FINLAYSON, since my former visits, in the Artillery arrangements on the front.

The point in which the Artillery still falls far short of requirements are in Aeroplane Co-operation and in the calculations and instruments necessary to ensure great accuracy of fire.

Both the above points are receiving my attention with a view to utilising fully the resources already available, buy, without the fulfilment of the aeroplane orders asked for for Russia, the Artillery work will always be backward and nothing like full value will be obtained from the Artillery here or to be sent here.

On the TARNOPOL front (just visited by Lt. Col. Finlayson) and offensive is being prepared by the 11th Army and should be ready in a few days. The "Artillery Plan" is fairly complete in the light of existing conditions; the Artillery concentration of the fronts of attack of this Army (7 versts) is :-  
* % *2SB 3M Field guns,36 4.8* field Howitzers.36 6H Suns and Howitsersu28 4,8s Russian Guna.16 6&quot; Hewltaera.10 11** Howitsers.Thin is considered a very big concentration on this front.To assist thin offtnslw, Majer VMM^TIMB R.F.O., with-a officers, 40 other fsmki, 14 aeroplanes.- and 15 wireless sets-hag? arrived at farnopol from Moscow, and is to remain attachedas a complete unit to the 6th Corps (left flank of the 11thkmjr) during the operational   2 hope that this detachment willhave considerable success in regulating the fire of theRussian Artillery, and in producing a good Moral effect.   The1,0.0. 6th Corps is allowing the detachment practically afree hand in arranging the operations indicated to it by Col.FinXayson at Ternopol.Major Jtaart B.O.A. is also proceeding to the 8th Corpswith a view to the communications between our aeroplanes andthe Russian batteries.The discipline of the Infantry in the 11th Army is goodfor Russia at present*   The information on the front pointsto there being hardly any Austrian Artillery opposite thefront of attack, and very few Infantry.If the Artillery carry ojit well the tasks set iheia, andthe Infantry&apos;s discipline permits the attack to be isade withsufficient elan and determination, there is every reason tolook forward to a big success, which may be checked only bythe disorganisation at the back curtailing the supplies ofssrsEiunition and food.On other parts of the fronts visited the discipline isnot co good.   As a general rule, the discipline of the Artil-lery is excellent but that of the Infantry is bad.   The &apos;latter say that- they are villiag to hold the line, but theyhave no intention of staking any offensive movement or even of
shooting&apos; at targets which exposo. themselves during ordinarytrench warfare.   In fact, eases have arisen stare the Infantryhave visited Russian batteries which they thought were firingtoo much, m&amp; have ordered them not to fire any more owing tothe possibility of their annoying the enemy and thus drawingretaliation on to them (the Infantry).   In one case, tits Art 11*lery sent the Infantry away and said they would continue- tofire,   tn another -ease, the :lwfsmiry arrested the batteryofficers ana threatened to bayonet the mm$ if the batteryfired again for some timeuOn the whole though, conditions on the front ana the dis*oipllug there have improved during the last two or three weeks.X also vlsited tha Artillery of Sncl. Boumaniau Army andhere found a surprisingly high state of efficiency.   The presenceof the French Officers on the Staff of the Corps and Pivisions.&apos; and also in the Regiments and batteriss has had a most markedeffoot.The-whole organisation, work, and knowledge of the bat--teries both field and Heavy is most satisfactory.There is no doubt whatover that a small supply of longrange Heavy Artillery, preferably 6** Howitsars, is mostessential for the Roumanian Army,   it present their only longrange heavy gun is the 120 m/m kong which is not sufficientlypowerful mti. in seme eases, owing to the mountainous country,unsuitable.If it oouis -possibly be arranged to give 4 Batteries of .6* Howitzers with&apos; 8,000 rounds per gun&apos;and afterwards a monthlyallowance of ammunition at the usual seals, it would, I am&apos;&apos;oon-vinoeo, have an excellent effect m% only in actual practicaluse, but also on the morale of the troops.The personnel -and transport for those batteries areimmediately available- and the batteries would bo put on thefront without dalay*
The greater part (24) of the 5" Howitzers have been despatched from here and all arrangements for their reception and immediate use have been made in Roumania. The remaining 8 will be despatched very shortly.

I was also much impressed by the excellent work carried out by the French Aviators. The Franco-Roumanian Squadron at MARACHESTI works not only with the Roumanian but also with the Russian Armies, and one sees here co-operation between Aeroplanes and Artillery and photographic developments quite out of contrast to the aviation standard in other parts of the front.
