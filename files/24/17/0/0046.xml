SECRET . ..   .G.T. 1146ctes &quot;by:-qir-Jaar-k-- ffykea on -Sir.-- Reginald -Uingat 0.* 3, Telegram He. 609.NI find the simpiedt way of commenting on Sir-8. ^ingat.o&apos;s -criticisms of the proposed draft report prepared by M. Picot andmyself is to reprint the High Commissioner&apos;s telegram with notesdealing with the specific points raised&quot;I should welcome any arrangement which promises on the onehand to give fair scope&apos;to legitimate Arab Nationalist aspirationsand on the other hand to secure a.uniform policy and prevent aclash of interests between French and us,I regard recognition by France of our &quot;free hand&quot; in ArabianPeninsula South of Area &quot;A&quot; as- a prime necessity to. latter:   .theFrench undertaking that their position in Syrian littoral willbo analogous to our position at Baghdad provides a satisfactoryguarantee that principle of Arab unity:, will not be contravened atthe outset&quot; .ITCTE I.. With this paragraph I am in hearty agreementprovided-always that it is clear that we do notinclude Bejaz. in our sphere of political influence.If there, is to be a King of Hejaz he must beindependent of all foreign- control otherwise hehas no value or influence and is only &apos;a danger.We may make such trade and commercial treaties aswe like with him, but unless we are taincur thepermanent hostility of the Moalem world and con-firm the Ottoman Caliphate as. a permanentinstitution, we must be clear in our own mindsthat the cities of Mecca and Medina are absolutelyindependent of the control of any Christian power,ourselves included.&quot;With Bykes-Picot desire &quot;to achieve a-general understanding* fand agreement between the two Powers as to broad line of policyeach will follow in their respective spheres-,, I am in perfectsympathy.     But having regard to extraordinary diver city of nativesand lipfcal- conditions within the area, the different method of
NOTE II.This observation of the High Commissioner13brings us up against the question which has beenpresent to my mind for the last two years, namely,&apos;are the relations of European peoples towards&quot;subject Asiatic peoples going to be the same afterlthe war as before the war?&apos;   . If there is anything-in the tendency of the age, in the advance of democ-racy, in the expressed view of the powers.withregard to small nationalities, I conclude thatthe answer is in the negative.If r thought that post-war England andFrance would in any way resemble pre-war Englandand France I should agree with the High Commis-sioner, but I am too strongly sensible of thefundamental change which has come over thedemocracies of the world tc imagine.that eitheroountry can ever return to pre-war Imperialmethods, no matter how liberal and enlightenedthey were.If we and the French intend to work towardsannexation then I am certain that our planB willsink in chao3 and failure;   if on the other handthe two Governments resolve to work hand, &quot;in-handto revive and re-establish a great people andassist in the development of a new civilization,and will protect these things in a dictionary, andnet a diplomatic sense, then I feel we have beforeus the prospect of great success, and an oppor-tunity of. obtaining for the democracies of Englandand France the full economic reward which theyrequire.&quot;With Sykes&apos;3 ^observations&apos; I agree generally,, subject tovitally important exception to paragraph 2 of his !Britishpolitical policy&apos; to which I have already referred in para-graph 1 of my-telegram No..605.   Our policy should be to obtainFrench recognition of our predominant position in Arabian PeninsulaaB a preliminary to concluding a treaty with King Hussein which,Whilst not impairing his independence vis-a-vis of Moslem world,Government by French and ourselves, and present illusory characterof an .Arabian Federal system, I am of opinion that similarityof administration&apos; is unattainable in practice and, even if 1 aid-down in theory, would be liable to tie the hands of both Goyern-ments in dealing with various native problems and political andeconomio interests of their respective spheres&quot;.
ft15will pro Tent any foreign power under guise of pilgrim interestfrom acquiring rights end privileges detrimental to our specialpolitical end oconomic interests in tho Hedjaz;     ..&apos;My remarks underparagraph   of my telegram No.605 and at the heginnin^ of thistelegram apply generally to Sylces; &quot;rocommendations&quot; ,T.NOTE III..      I again agfeo with the High Commissioner intho whole of this paragrajjh, with the exception ofthe expression &quot;political rights&quot;.     If the sugges-tion is that the King of the Eedjaz is to he undera kind of disguised British Suzerainty, nothingcould I am sure he worse for us or for. him.     AcKing cf Mecca he must he as free to deal with anypower as with us.     Is it to he imagined that wecould object to the King of Hedjaz sending a missionto the Sultan of Turkey in poaco time without impair-ing his position vis-a-vis tho Moslem world?     Ifwe cannot in future object to his holding diplomaticconverse with our existing enemies how can we preventhim from having dealings with any power which hasMoslem subjects?If we reduce him to the position of a feudatorychief in our pay, then we not only destroy the Arabmovement but we throw tho whole control of the Moslemworld into the hands of the Turks, tho pan-islamists,the seditionists and the Egyptian revolutionaryNetionslists,&quot;As regards his&quot;scheme&quot; I join issue with Sykes on follow-lng points.Paragraph 2.&quot; I deem it inconceivable that any useful orreal similarity of legal&apos; or education systems con bo attained owingto contrast of French and British methods.     I therefore regarda discussion on these points as academic and premature.NjOTBJCY.        I should not have made this suggestion wereI not certain that tho French wore prepared torevise their previous methods.     if tho Frenchwero going to&quot;annex and govern, I should agreewith&quot;the High Commissioner, but as it is to bopresumed that tho native personnel, both legaland educational, must be drawn from the samesources, namely, educated Arabs of both spheres,and as education and law.have been identicalhitherto, and- as tho services will probably remainin the hands of the same lawyers and schoolmasters,
as were employed &quot;by the Turkish Government, Icannot see&apos;&apos;what there is inconceivable in bothpowers agreeing to follow a similar policy.&quot;Paragraph-3.   Question of advisers is more likely tobecome acute, in French sphere than in our own.- - Departmental con-trol woulu be nugatory over greater part of region -and local con-diticn3 even in more enlightened Bagdad area and on Syrian littoralare too similar to warrant identical treatment4   I deprecs-te any-thingin the nature of an agreement on-the- subject although- aninterchange of. views may be desirable from the standpoint of bothGovernments&quot;.NOTE V. The High Commissioner seems not to have quitsunderstood the meaning of the draft. . Our draft pro-:posal is not that the two Powers should come toan agreement.with one another, but that they shouldcome to separate but identical agreements with theArab political elements   It is to be noted that. Sir Reginald admits that an interchange of views  -, may be desirable * no more is - suggestedin the draft.As to identical treatment not being Warrantedowing to dissimilarity of conditions prevailingin Bagdad and Damascus, the draft explains thedanger to both powers of one Power shewing greateror less liberality of policy than the other.&quot;Paragraph 4., (3)     I &quot;agree that,King Hussein should have anassured revenue but latter part of this proposal., translatedinto practice, would me^n thai he must look to Syria, that io toTrance, for bulk of his-revenue   This.proposal therefore is most(dangerous?) and we-should oppose any attempt-by-French to ter-minate our direct subsidy to the-King before his financial state-can-be-secured on a basis more consistent with our politicalinterests (his telegram)&quot;.  .-.NOTE YT..     This criticism ia based -on the -assumption thatthe King of Hejaz should remain a Briti3h
pensioner......     .. I quite egree that neither PoWerb sphereshould supply the bulfc of his revenue, hut that:the contribution should nominally oomO from theV/akf st and that we should bring, our Mesopotamia-Hakf contribution up to the amount yielded&quot;bj; the French area by an addition from the Grownlands Y/hlch could be handed over to thoMesopotamia &apos;7akf administration.&quot;I think stimulation regarding Kihg&apos;s temporary residenceoutside Hodjaz would be politically very ill-advised and inconflict with recommendation&quot; under Section ( ).I do not consider the &quot;King could agree to a proposalso detrimental to his prestige:   nor do I think we should askhim to do so.&quot;-NOTE VII.   Unless we cono to. some arrangement as to theKing of Hodjaz not residing&apos;la Syria or Irak woshell presently be confronted with the danger ofone Power holding the titular Suzerain of theother Power&apos;s sphere. -&quot;(5) Question of. succession can well bo loft ovor fortho present&quot;.NOTE VIII.     Unless wo recognise and organise tho Arabmovement on businesslike.lines now, we shall befaced with dynastic troubles in the future.To turn the movement into reasonable channelsis the&apos; beat guarantee we can have that it willnot break up aid become hostile to us, as if. left to dissension, querrels and jealousiesIt may well do.2, ^Yhitehall Gardens, .3.7/&apos;. 2nd.
