its-G.T*-1114HOMS-3a3VvSD BEER FOR Bj-Y A1JD COJtfl EiRVSST,In a few agricultural counties in the East and west ofEngland, it has always been cue ternary either for farmers tobrew beer themselves for use by their labourers during thehay and corn Lax vest, or tc give the men a certain quantityof malt with which to brow their own beer.Early in the present year the question of privatebrewing was raised.   It was considered tnat, if privatebrewing were permitted, the practice would be so largelyincreased as to stultify tne restrictions imposed uponbrewers.   Permissions for private brewing were, therefore,with my concurrence, rofused by the Food Controller,It now appears that in many rural districts no beerat all can be obtained.   Farmers are unable either to brewthemselves, or obtain malt-for their laoourers, or buy beerfrom others.This shortage is producing a somewhat serious crisisin those districts where the hay harvest has already begun.The work has to be done at top speed in trying conditions.The difficulty will recur at the corn harvest.The amount of malt required for this limited privatebrewing for both hay and corn harvests is estimated at 10,000quarters of malt - 5,000 quarters for the farmer, and 5.000quarters for the labourer,   I am informed by the Malt C?-earingHouse Committee, through Mr* Gretton. that this quantity couldbe spared from existing stocks, provided that a sufficient supplyis permitted to be malted in September,   Farmers could be allottedtheir proportion of malt to brew as in previous years,   At&apos; regardsthe distribution of malt by farmers to their labourers, the WarAgricultural Committees of the counties concerned,, eoujd giantcertificates to farmers on satisfying themselves that the rsaltis required, has been customary, and is the least quantity whichwill suffice.     On -the so certificates the Malt Clearing HouseCommittee would issUe the malt.The late Food Controller, Lord Devonport, decided thathe could nob withdraw from the position that he had alreadytaken up, and that no private brewing oould be allowed foragriculturists without causing great dissatisfaction inmunition areas.The point, however, is so urgent that I submit itfor the decision of the Cabinet.R* E* iPROTEERO*
