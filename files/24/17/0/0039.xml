WAR CARIHET,WAR TRADE ADVISOET COMMITTEE.REPORT CP COMMITTEE ASSEMBLED TO CONSIDER REG OBSTRUCT I Off(Previous papers G.T. 434,  516 and 1037)1.        The War Cabinet on paper .G.T. 516 decided that the question&quot; of the reconstruction cf the War Trade Advisory Committee shouldbe settled by a Onmmittee composed of- &apos; Lord Robert CecilLord EmmettSir Francis Kopwood andMr. E.S. Montagu.2.     We have taken the matter into consideration accordingly, andwe are of opinion that the Committee should continue until itis&apos; superseded by seme organization designed to take over anddischarge its duties, and that its functions should meanwhilebe exercised under wider and more comprehensive terms ofreference.*3.      We suggest that it is a waste of power to summon all themembers of the War Trade Advisory Committee, many of whom arevery busy men,  to every meeting of the Committee.    It seemspreferable to use the list rf names as a panel and for theChairman of the Committee&apos;-to e:::eroise his discretion and toinvite members to attend according to -che business to be trass-acted.   This in our judgment is ail the more important as weare of opinion that the following Committees and Departmentswho are not now represented on the Committee ought to haverepresentatives upon it if the Committee is invested withlarger powers, viz: the Reconstruction Committee,  the Corn-mission Internationale de Ravitaillement, and the Mini striesof Shipping and Food.   It is we think of particular import-ance that the Reconstruction   Committee should be representedon the War Trade Advisory Committee in order that such woikof the War Trade Advisory Committee as might be of sssis-tance to the Reconstruction Committee-may be reported to it.4.       The following is therefore a summary of our recommendations:-(a) That the War Trade Advisory Committee shall continuefor the present.(b) That the Chairman shall use the Committee as a paneland shall invite members to attend according to thebusiness to be transacted.(c) That the terms of reference shall be as follows:To consider and auvise the V7ar Cabinet upon any inter-departmental questions relating to supplies and-tradeduring the war as affected by the war,  which the WarCabinet or any ether Government Department may referto it.
** 2 T(d) That representatives of the Reaon-s-truction Committee,the Commission Internationale de RavitajLllement,Shipping Controller and Food Controller shall hep1aced on the pane1.(e) That-this arrangement shall he considered atemporary arrangement pending the establishmentof some organization designed to take over anddi s charge its dut i es.(fj   That the War Trade Advisory Committee shall nothave any stated time for meeting and shall onlymeet when matters arc referred to it by theCabinet or the head of a Department representedon the panel cf the Committee.(Initialled).
