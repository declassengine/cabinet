SECRET.MINISTRY  OF FOOD.. &apos; -   v: T      ^      , 166Report for Week ending Wednesday, June 20, 1917.PART I.-ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies and Prices.Orders. No Orders uader the Defence of the Realm Regulations have been issueddaring the week.Export of Foodstuffs from America. As a further expression of official, anxietyon the subject of: American food legislation, Lord Rhondda made a statement ouJune .18 to the effect that the problem of our food primarily depended on supply, andthat the solution of this problem mainly rested with our American Allies. He.expressed his confidence that Congress and the American people would respond tothe calls made to them, and so organise their vast resources that the German hopeof starving the Allies or of causing civilian unrest by scarcity, of food or high priceswould be doomed to failure. Lord Rhondda&apos;s statement was published in the Americannewspapers on June 20.Flour Mills Control Committee. The question of imported flour in relation to itscolour as compared with the Government Regulation Flour manufactured in theUnited Kingdom was considered, owing to the numerous complaints of inequalitiesin resulting bread which this gave rise to, and it was decided to recommend the FoodController to reduce the amount of imported flour which bakers were permitted to hseuader licence from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent, in England, Wales, and. Ireland, andfrom 40 per cent, to 20 per cent, in Scotland.. A. second report on Potato Flour was considered in relation to the possibility ofthe new crop exceeding the ordinary consumptive requirements, and as to whetherthe surplus could be turned into potato flour suitable for admixture with wheatenHour. The capacity of the existing starch mills was estimated, if adapted for thispurpose, to be from 10,000 to 25,000 tons of Potato Flour and the additionalmachineryto cope with this could only be provided with difficulty. : -Cured Fish-The Committee considered the existing stocks of herrings held bythe Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department in connection with the encouragementof the curing industry during the coming season, and it was resolved to allow theexport of: all last summer&apos;s herrings, and 50 per cent, of the winter-cured herrings,which, owing, to the hot -weather, it would be difficult to keep for consumption here.An intimation to this effect has been made to the herring trade. It is believed that,as a result of this arrangement, an adequate reserve of the best herrings will remainin the country, and fishermen and curers will be placed in a position to continue theirbusiness of maintaining the fish supplies of the country so far as existing circumstancespermit. . /.. &apos;Sugar. The total demand for private growers of fruit is not yet finally ascer-lained, but an approximate figure of eight to- ten thousand tons for soft fruitrequirements is indicated. The indent will probably be met either as to 75 per cent,or in full. The position has been affected by the sinking of the s.s. &quot; Monarch &quot; thisweek, with about 3,800 tons of American white sugar.The movement of sugar into the shops for the purpose of meeting demands isbeing expedited as quickly as possible, especially in the South of England. It will be,however, another week at least before a substantial quantity all round is available.As regards sugar for ordinary consumption, no further loss of cargoes has beenreported. Nevertheless, the position as regards the sugar supply is causing the Sugar^bmmission very grave anxiety. To the failure in- arrivals, due to German submarines,ihere is being added an equally serious measure of failure due to delay in the allocationof shipping for conveyance of sugar. &apos; On the programme agreed with the Ministry ofShipping, the amount of tonnage in arrear for cargoes1 to be shipped from Cuba andthe West Indies during the month of June, approaches 50,000 tons.A  (33)3203-3   Pk 1   ol)  6/17   E fifS &quot; .   &quot;    &apos; - u &apos; A
The consequence is that by the middle of August the stocks in hand will be lessthan 20,000 tons, even if no losses are incurred between now and then. The loss ofno more than three sugar ships in the next eight weeks would mean that, by themiddle of August, the country would be practically entirely destitute of sugar.Hardly anything that can be done, during these eight weeks, can go far even tomitigate the extreme gravity of the impending situation; but, with a view to thetaking of any steps that may be possible to improve matters, and to prevent at any ratea recurrence of such a critical state of, things, the Commission is making the moststrenuous appeals to the Ministry of Shipping to adhere at least.to the programmesfrom time to time agreed upon, as regards the provision of ships for conveyance ofsugar.Potatoes. The first arrivals of Spanish potatoes imported by the Ministry areexpected at the end of this week, consisting of two consignments 1,000 tons toLondon and .500 tons-to Liverpool. There are no others en route, the licences toexport having only been available from the Spanish Government durkig the last twoor three days. The announcement to the effect that Spanish potatoes were actuallyin transit had the immediate effect of causing a drop in the f.o.b. cost of Jerseypotatoes of 101. per ton.Crops in the early districts of the United Kingdom are advanced fully equal tonormal years. English potatoes from districts other than Cornwall may be expectedin the markets during the coming week with a general lifting as from the first daysof July, so that by the time the middle of July is reached the price of Englishpotatoes may fall as low as 152. or 161. per ton. The weather conditions promise tofavour this result.Provisions. It is a matter for satisfaction that large supplies of bacon and hamshave been landed in recent weeks, in almost embarrassing quantity in view of thehot weather and transport difficulties. Steps are being taken with the object ofconserving the present abundant supplies for a period when shipments will largelydecrease.Owing to restriction of export, and the necessity of requiring the return of cocoabutter from Holland resulting from the treatment of cocoa beans sent to that country,there .is an accumulation. of cocoa butter here which cannot be absorbed by anynormal demand. It is a valuable fat, and proposals are in contemplation to make useof it in connection with the manufacture of margarine, which is in short supply. Thenormal value of cocoa butter is too high for this purpose, and its forced depreciationmay. involve a compensating rise in the price of cocoa powder. This may, however,be a lesser evil than the export of large quantities of cocoa butter at present.As the result of a conference with the War Office and Foreign Office arrangementsare being made to permit the export of a certain quantity of cocoa butter byMessrs. Nestle for the.manufacture in Switzerland of chocolate required by the wat-Office.       . &apos;. . On Wednesday, June 20, Lord Rhondda received a deputation of theLancashire and Yorkshire Bonus Grocers&apos; Association, who asked for exemption fromthe.Orders fixing maximum prices for retailers in places where the bonus system isin operation. The practice of these traders is to return a bonus to their customersquarterly, amounting to 3s. in the 11. on all purchases. They claim -that this systemis advantageous to their customers and encourages thrift and. that it is very popularin the North. They asked that they should not be held to have infringed the Ordersprovided that the final net price was not higher than the maximum retail pricefixed.   Lord Rhondda promised to consider the point raised. &apos;..... ..       &apos; -  . Food Economy Campaign.Reports received from various centres during the week show that in a still largernumber of towns the consumption of bread and flour is steadily decreasing as a resultof the Food Economy. Campaign. In the borough of Paddington, for example, thedecrease &quot;has now reached 25-per cent., comparing an average taken last week withthe figures of two months ago&apos;. -The Willesden (Metropolitan Police Area) figures are : . . lbs.     ;Week ending May 12 , - - - . 463,831  ..      . , May 19 ,    - - - 438,777.   .May 26   l7lJ-i.   , ,....      -       ... , 365,798 &apos;  :&apos;, .June 2    - - - ,        - 329,456
At Folkestone tlie figures supplied by three bakers work out as follows :--Baker No. 1 supplying 3,200 families SI lbs. $ oz. per person per week.Baker No. 2 supplying 481 families 2 lbs. 1 oz. per person per week.Baker No. 3 supplying 3321amilies 2 lbs, 9 ozs. per.person per week..,The largest firm in Crewe reports that it sold 56,000 lbs. less bread during May1917 than during May 191 b\        - --.     -; , &apos; &apos;The campaign steadily grows in intensity throughout the country and everychannel of popular appeal is being used. &apos;The film &quot; Every body&apos;s Business &quot; produced in the interests of the Food EconomyCampaign was shown last week in 80 London cinema houses and is now touring theprovinces where, judging by reports in the press, it is creating very considerableinterest.   &quot;    &apos; - -Enforcement of Orders. &apos; .,&apos;Inspection. A number of communications have been received on the subject ofthe overlapping in respect alike of inspection and prosecution, due to the concurrentpowers possessed by the police, the local authorities, and inspectors of weights andmeasures, and an interdepartmental conference has been arranged to discuss thematter and devise a satisfactory solution. -. Prosecutions.- The Farringdon Road costermongers who have been retailingpotatoes for consumption at M. per lb. were prosecuted at the request of this Ministry,lines being imposed, amounting to 1SL 4s. There have been numerous successfulprosecutions of a similar character-both in London and the provinces.Offences occasioned by the imposition of illegal conditions on the sale of sugarare being prosecuted throughout the country. The public and the magistrates do notin all cases appear to be aw7are of the fact that it is no offence to refuse to sell sugar.A man was fined 51. at Dartford for hoarding sugar. He stated in defence thatlie wished the sugar to last for 12 months. . .Prosecutions for the waste of bread continue, and a fine of 51. and costs wrasimposed at Birmingham on the 18th June for the waste of 4 lbs. of bread fit for humanconsumption.-/ - ^ . -Ireland. The position in Ireland has appreciably improved. In Dublin inspectionis being&quot; carried out by the Metropolitan Police, and in the provinces the Royal IrishConstabulary show marked activity, both in bringing the Orders to the notice of thepersons interested and in prosecuting cases of non-observance. &apos;   ;    v; - -In Dublin and the larger provincial towns the better class hotels, bakers andconfectioners, appear to &quot;be loyally endeavouring to comply with the Orders althoughthere are some exceptions. In the smaller towns and rural districts, it is believedthat little attention is paid to the Orders by those who are affected by them.There have been numerous prosecutions, especially under the Orders relating topotatoes, bread, confectionery and conditional sales, but some, difficulty has beenexperienced by the police in securing convictions, even in cases where the evidenceappeared to be clear.Rationing of Horses. The continuance of racing in Ireland has made the Horses(Rationing) Order in that country a dead letter, and has complicated its enforcementas regards racehorses here, as these are being raced in Ireland in increasing numbers.H does not appear that any good two or three-year-old. horses have been taken out oftraining ; nor is it likely that the consumption of oats will be effectively lessened,so long as actual or prospective racing is allowed.The number of applications for licences has been extremely small, partly becauseowners appear to think -that so long as they do not use their horses exclusively forpleasure purposes they are entitled to treat them as solely or mainly used for trade orbusiness purposes, partly because such quantities of oats as are already in stock aretreated as available for all classes of horses whether within or outside the Order solong as the aggregate allowance is not exceeded. ....
PART IT-SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION..;: Imports. .      -There was a large increase in the imports of food during the week ended 16fch June,the total quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs received (as showninTable A)being 310,600 tons, compared with 201,500 tons in the previous week, 303,200 tons&apos;in the corresponding week of 1916, and a weekly average of 211,600 tons since thebeginning of 1917.The increase was due mainly to heavy imports of wheat, amounting to 173,000tons compared with 112,000 tons in the previous week and a weekly average of102,000 tons this year. There were also exceptionally large imports of sugar(amounting to over 56,000 tons, compared with less than 10,000 tons in the previousweek and a weekly average of 23,000 tons since the beginning of this year), ofwheaten flour (20,600 tons compared with an average, this year, of 9,500 tons), andof oats (19,000 tons, against 3,500 tons in the previous week and an average of7,300 tons).The imports of mutton, cheese, and margarine also showed considerableimprovement, and those of bacon continued to be above the average. There was amarked drop, however, in the imports of maize (3,200 tons, compared with 28,000 tonsin the prev^s week, and an average of nearly 33,000 tons), and the imports of lard,butter, and barley were still below the average.The total; imports of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs since thebeginning of the year now amount to 5,077,500 tons, compared with 5,632,000 tonsin the corresponding period of 1916, showing a reduction of 554,500 tons, or nearly30 per cent. The articles chiefly responsible for the decrease are barley (194,000tons), sugar (190,000 tons), wheat (170,000 tons), and oats (137,000 tons). The importsof wheaten flour, beef, mutton, hams, and margarine are also considerably belowthose for the corresponding period of last year. The imports of maize, however, aregreater by 183,000 tons, and there are substantial increases in the imports of bacon,lard, cheese, butter, and glucose.Consumption of Meat.The supplies of dead meat entering the markets at. London, Liverpool, Manchester,and Glasgow in the week ended 9th June (Table B), were 5 per cent, above theaverage weekly supplies in May, .1.917, but 151 Per cent, below those for the corre-sponding week in 1916. As compared with the average for May, there was an increaseat each of the markets except Liverpool, where there was practically no change. Ascompared with the same week of 1916, there were decreases of 18 per cent, in Londonand 10 per cent, at Manchester, but there was no change at either Liverpool orGlasgow.In the week ended 16th June, the supplies in London fell heavily, being 17% percent, below those of the previous week, 13 per cent, below the average for May, and24 per cent, below the supplies in. the corresponding week of 1916.The supplies of fat cattle received at 51 markets in Great Britain during theweek ended 13th June were 9 per cent, below those of the previous week and 10 percent, below the average for the corresponding weeks in the years 1914-16. Thenumber of fat sheep received, though 8 per cent, higher than in the previous week,Avas also below the 1914-16 average, by 16 per cent., and the supplies of fat pigswere 8^ per cent, below those of the preceding week and 15 per cent, below theaverage for the corresponding week in 1914-16.Stocks of Cereals.Wheat. The stocks of wheat (including flour expressed as wheat) on 18th Juneare estimated to have amounted to 1,242,000 tons, compared with 1,149 000 tons at11th June, 1,128,000 tons at 1st June 1917, and 1,463,000 tons a year ago.Barley.-The stocks of barley (including maltsters&apos; stocks) at 18th June, areestimated to have been 363,000 tons, compared with 376,000 tons at 11th June&apos; andwith 396,000 tons at 1st June.Oats.-The stocks at 18th June are estimated at 227,000 tons, compared with250,000 tons at 11th June, and 302,000 tons at 1st June.Maize. The stocks at 18th June are estimated at 115,000 tons, compared with146,000 tons at 11th June and with 156,000 tons at 1st June.
a3Wholesale Prices.The principal changes, since the previous week, shown by the latest availablewholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs, as; given in Table C, are furtherdecreases in New Zealand butter ;(4s. per cwt.), Canadian bacon (4s. per cwt.),Danish bacon (3s. 6d per cwt.), English mutton (3s. 6c?.. per cwt.), and Irish butter(3s. per cwt.), and a further increase of 5s. per cwt. in English beef. .There were alsominor increases in the prices of imported wheat, Argentine chilled beef, and tea, andsmall decreases in Danish butter and cotton-seed cake.The &quot; Gazette &quot; average price of British barley rose by 7s. llcZ. per quarter, butthis is due to the inclusion, in the statistics on which the average is based, of anincreased proportion of kiln-dried barley (to which the order fixing a maximum priceof 65s. per quarter for British barley is not applicable) and not to an increase in theselling price of grain of similar quality.As compared with a month before, the articles showing the most marked changesare imported bacon and butter, English, beef, and sugar. The price of Danish baconis lower by 22s. Qd. per cwt. (nearly 2\d. per lb.), and that of Canadian bacon by13s. 6d. per cwt. (nearly \\d. per lb.). New Zealand butter is cheaper, by 20s. per cwt.,and Irish butter by 7s. per cwt. On the other hand, English beef -has increased inprice by 16s. M. per cwt. (IfcL per lb.) and sugar has risen by 4s. 4-^d. per cwt. (forgranulated) to 6s. 7\d. per cwt. (for cubes). There have also been reductions in theprices of Danish butter, Irish bacon, country &quot;straight run&quot; flour, tea, and oil-seedcake, and increases in English mutton, Argentine beef, and imported wheat.With the exception of Argentine mutton, which is cheaper by 7s. per cwt., everyarticle included in the Table shows a rise in price since the corresponding date of 1916.The increases are greatest in the cases of palm-kernel cake (168s. per ton, or. 107 percent.), Plate maize (34s. per ton, or 83 per cent.), Calcutta linseed (265s. per ton, or79 per cent.), British oats (23s. per 312 lbs., or 72 per cent.), linseed cake (16.0s. perton, or 62 per cent.), British wheat (29s. 4cZ. per 480 lbs., or 60 per cent.), and rice(9s. 9d. per cwt., or 52 per cent.). There are also increases of between 40 and 50. percent, in the prices of London flour and Egyptian cotton-seed, and in the &quot; Gazette &quot;average price of British barley, of 35 or 36 per cent, in the prices of Irish andCanadian bacon and of palm-kernels, and of 20 to 26 per cent, in the prices ofEnglish beef and mutton and Irish butter. The average sale price of tea, includingthe proportion allocated direct to buyers at Is. per lb., was about Is. 4\d. per lb.,compared with Is. per lb. a year ago. The articles showing the smallest increase inprice are Danish bacon (6 per cent.), Argentine chilled beef (10 per cent.), NewZealand butter (12 per. cent.), and sugar (12 to 14 per cent.). &quot;
