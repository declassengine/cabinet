Pensions for relatives, of sailors of theMercantile Marine lost at sea.Early in 1915., before the &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk, a schemewas arranged with the Ear Risks Insurance Associations for payingpensions to the dependants of merchant seamen who lost theirlives owing to the operations of &quot;.ar.    Broadly speaking, thescheme provides for the payment to a widow of compensation equi-valent to a pension of one-third of her husband&apos;s ore-war pay,plus one-twentyfourth   for each child up to 16, up to the numberof four.    This is the scale laid down under the Injuries in WarCompensation Acts for the crewa of Fleet Auxiliaries.    Wherea claimant is entitled to compensation under the Workmen1 s  Com-pensation Acts, the legal liability under those Acts is dischargedin the ordinary way and the amount paid in the form of pensioncorrespondingly reduced.    The minimum compensation payable to awidow under the   old scheme was equivalent to a pension of 10/-* aweek, and the minimum allowance for each child 2/6 a week.The only alteration made in the scheme since its introductionis that the minimum pension for widows has been raised from 10/-to 13/9 per week, and&apos;the minimum allowances for children havebeen raised from 2/6 in respect of e.ich child up to the number offour to the following:- .: -5/-     per week for the first child.4/2      &quot;  &apos;ft     &quot;    &quot;  second child,3/4      &quot;    &quot;     &quot;    &quot;   third child,and &apos; 2/6      M    &quot;     ?J        fourth^ each succeeding child.Under the scheme before it was amended, the minimum
minimum pension for a widow with six children under 16&apos;would have been 10/- for herself, and 10/- for the children,or 20/- in all.    Under the amended scheme the widow willreceive 13/9 for herself, and 20/- for the children, or atotal of 33/9. ,In the event of injury or disablement resulting intotal incapacity two-thirds of the pre-war pay is paidto the disabled seaman, and proportionate allowances aremade if the injury or disablement has only impaired theearning capacity of the injured man.     In the event of death.where there is no widow, compensation is payable to otherdependants.The minimum pension to a widow under the CompensationScheme is identical with that granted to the widow of aPrivate in the Army or to the widow of Naval ratings belowsecond class Petty Officer.    The widows of officers ofhigher rank in the Army or&quot;Navy are granted pensions atfixed rates whioh probably roughly correspond with theirincreased pay.    Under the Compensation Scheme the pensionis mad* to depend directly upon the pay the officer orseaman receives.The children*B allowances for&quot;all.of the Army andNaval ratings entitled to pensions are identical with theminimum allowance payable tinder the Compensation Scheme.In the event of a seaman being&apos; taken prisoner, com-pensation in the form of a regular allowance is paid tothe dependants on the same scale as&apos; if the seaman had losthis life.    These allowances continue so long as the seamanis prevented by reason of his internment from providing forhis dependants,rd of Trade,19th June, 1917.
