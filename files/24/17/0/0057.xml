Petrograd.

21st June, 1917.

1183.

Last night the Chief of Staff Petrograd Military District received what he describes as a bomb. On the ground that march companies are proceeding to Front in quite inadequate numbers from Petrograd, Kerenski has ordered that "Heroic" measures are to be taken, consisting in the despatch of all the regiments of the Petrograd garrison, with the exemption of 250 men per regiment to be left to furnish guards. Units from front are to take their places. It is impossible for the Government to enforce this order, and if the regiments refuse to go, as many certainly will, the Government must lose the position it has gained, or else report to bloodshed, which cannot but have the worst results.

Kerenski&apos;s accusation is not true, because many of the regiments here have sent march companies to the front regularly, and in adequate numbers. The railways also would with greatest difficulty compete with such a movement of troops. From 5 worst regiments alone here, there would have to be sent over 70,000 men. Further the despatch of some of the regiments here would do more harm than good. They would most certainly refuse to fight. During night the Commander in Chief was to see Kerenski about it, and has promised to inform me of the result. He says it is quite impossible to carry out the order.

If Kerenski insists there will certainly be trouble, and trouble here will most certainly have a bad influence on the Front.
