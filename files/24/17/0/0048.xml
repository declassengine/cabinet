C RJT&apos; &apos;     &apos; 163114-8PROPOSAL.OF TITS CENTRAL. CONTROL BOARD(LIQUOR TRAFFIC) THAT BREAKS MM BSALLOWED TO &quot;-BREW CERTAIN BEER WITHOUTRESTRICTION U^TDER^HE i INTOXICATINGLIQUOR [OUTPUT,AND DELIVERY) ORDER,1917. 1 See.Paper G.T.,    1092*)   &apos;   &apos;Copy of letter, dated 22-nd June 1917 fromthe Private, Secretary, to Chancellor, of theExchequer to the. Secretary.War Cabinet *Jear Hankey,The enclosed memorandum has been forwarded to tho .Chancellor by the Board of Pustoms and Excise in connectionwith G.T.1092 which was forwarded to the Chairman by the&apos;-7ar Cabinet Secretariat.If the concession is accepted by the ?rar Cabinet,the Customs should be consulted (l) as to the exact nature ofthe concession, and ( 2)&apos; as ti the wording of any order bringingit into force.Yours sincerely,.&quot;(Signed)   H.- P. Hamilton *1VISM0RANDUM.1.     All fermented liquor, whatever Its original gravity,-if brewed at a licensed brevrery is &quot;beer&quot;, forming part ofthe brefrer &apos;s output and,, this output is &quot;at present limited bythe Intoxicating Liquor (Output, and Delivery) Order 1917*The suggestion made by the Central Control Board (LiquorTraffic) is that a certain class, of very.light beer shouldbe excluded from the restriction, on. barrelage made under thatOrder, thus, if a brewer.produced - say - 1,000 barrels of beeron which a charge for duty was raised., and of this - say **200 barrels were beer of. this light gravity [2%. spirit)Variety, his output under the Restriction Order would-be takenas 800.2*.     The proposal appears to want consideration fromseveral points of view(l)   To adopt It means (a) the use of.more material (grain.and sugar) by the. brewers than is at present.;   provided for, and (b.) the extension (which is notreferred to in the Memorandum of the Control Board)*f the concession as to the use of such materialsby persons other than licensed brewers.,, as beernf this description is also manufactured on
- 2premises other than those of licensed brokers, viz. by&quot;certain Table &quot;rater manufacturers, (the beer beingcharged duty not as a beer but as a Table -rater),who are..restricted&apos; in&apos; the &quot;quantities of materialsallowed to be used&apos;in their1trade.      These areprimarily, matters for the Pood Controller,The Customs and Excise department would be interestedalmost entirely in the question of control, as if theproposal were adopted it would necessarily follow thata certain amount of supervision would have to beexercised by the Department in-order to:ascertainwhat part of the brevier&apos;s Output was to. be disregardedin calculating &quot;&quot;his bSrrelage under the Restriction Order.There would be considerable temptation to, andopportunity for, abuse of a concession such as thatasked for, as low gravity beer browed ostensibly asintended for a 2% proof spirit beer could be used to mixwith other beer forming part of the brewers ordinarybarrelage and .thus to some extent .evade the.restrictionon output.      It-^lso to be noted that the product ion. ofspirit in the beer is a process which takes placeafter the revenue control ceases, and that it may easilyexceed the 2% limit even if brewed at quite a low specificgravity..     &quot;Beer&quot; is charged at the brewery On its specificgravity before fermentation and withoutisferonoe to thespirit which it may eventually contain. ,  So far as theRevenue- is concerned with-beer brewed at a brewery, 2%&apos;proof spirit beer is not recognized, .ior except underspecial conditions would it be recognizable.If it be decided to agree -to the proposal of the CentralControl Board, it will bo necessary to impose conditions,and it would be highly desirable that it should be grantedsubject to conditions to be made by the Board of Customsand Exoiso.       Satisfactory control would bo extremelydifficult, but conditions could probably be imposed whichwould haVe the effect of restraining any serious tendencyto an abuso of a concession.It is also to be not eel that if the licensed brewer isgiven special consider?ti-on to enable him to brew thisclass of liquor, this will certainly be. seized upon bythe Mineral Water Trade as a grievance, of somo moment;it will be remembered that one of the complaints of theTrade has been that whereas all &apos;fermented Table Watersother than Herb Beer arc $-axed a*t. 4d. per gallon,  (andsuch a tax is levied on certain low gravity beer whichif brewed, away fr-om the licensed premises of a brewer isnot taxable as beer) the duty leviable on the lightgravity beer in question if brewed at a licensed brewerywould be from 2d. to 3d. per gallon according tc gravity.Further than that, the Mineral Water Trade may urge that ifbrewers are allowed to use materials without limitation inthe manufacture of this class of beer, which is in thenature of a temperance beverage, they should have a similarfree hand in the use of materials in.their manufactures whichconsist entirely of temperance beverages.(initialled)     A.J.T.Board of Customs and Excise.21st June, 1917.
