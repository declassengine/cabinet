sj o S g J*5.T.1147U30UR FuH THS ASHICULTUI-AX PkOCRAMMS.Memorandum by Lord liilner.I circulate this note to the Cabinet be-oauee aja^iriKDeiimWdecision is necessary on the subject of Agricultural Labour.SteiS must be, taken at once to get the lebour. otherwise theprogramme of increased cultivation for the&apos; cereal year 1917-16,&quot;es far at least as Ling Land and Scotland are concerned,will fail... The other difficulties - the supply ofmachines, of fertilisers, of horses - aro all in process ofbeing overcome.   But the labour difficulty declines tobudge.   I have spent many hours&apos; work&apos; upon it since it waslest before the Cabinet four weeks a.go,.,and have had anynumber of interviews end committee meetings.     The resulthas been disappointlrg\.    I hsvs succeeded in getting addi-tionel labour from several sources,   out in the aggregatethe numbers obtainable from these sources are small comparedto the minimum number required for any substantial increase  .of production.   The bulk will have to come from the Armyand can only be got by a direct Cabinet instruction to theArmy. &quot;The issue is quite simple and cannot be evaded: &apos; arcwe or are we not prepared to give that instruction?There are two reasons why the question must be settlednow.     The first is that the next 5 or 6 weeks - roughlyspeaking, the period between the hay and the corn harvest -is a period of supreme importance for the incroaso of thearable area, .   borne valuable time has already been lest  nd&quot;che original programme has already been cut down in cense-cuence.     V,&apos;o cannot afford to lose further time without astill more damaging inroad upon it, or without destroyingthe already waning belief in our seriousness of purpose.This alone is a sufficient ground for taking immediate action,if the policy we have repeatedly proclaimed, Is to be carriedout.   The second reason is that a debate is - Impending inthe House of Lords - on a motion put down by Viscount Chaplinfor next Wednesday - in which r:e cannot possibly avoid makinga olear statement as to the prospect of increasing the supplyof agricultural labour.   &apos;.e were very stsvetr^ly. pressed, onthis subject a month ago, and if wo are now obligou to admitthat we do not see. our way. to getting the labour&apos;, whicheverybody knows to be essential to the carrying out of ourplans, the impression produced will be disastrous.   Therecan be no doubt whatever that a considerable number of land-owners aro averse to the policy of breaking up land.   TheCounty Agricultural Committees are meeting with a good dealof resistance to their efforts to increase the arable, area. -.In somo cases no doubt this resistance is justified, :-ndconsiderable latitude has wisoly been left to the Committeesby the Board of Agriculture   to vary or curtail the demandsmade.upon farmers and landowners, when good reason can beshown for such modification,   iiut in a far greater numberof cases the resistance is due to the unwillingness ofindividuals to run the risks and make the sacrifices, whichthe needs-of the nation imperatively demand. .. DirectResistance however.., is, under the circumstances, very dlfii- -cult and could not be successfully persisted in on any largescale without some good excuse-. . buch an excuse is -provided,if it can be shown that the labour necessary, for breaking
up grass land, and for its proper cultivation, when brokenup, is not forthcoming.   Unless they are in a position tosay, thst the necessary labour will-.be available, the CountyAgricultural Committees, cannot insist on compliance withtheir demands, however otherwise reasonable, and howevernecessary to the attainment of the supremely importantobject of an increase in the home production of Pood.The position can be put in a nutshell by one or twoquotations,   Speaxin^ in the House of Lords in the debatealready referred to fay 23ri) I said :&quot;All I should like noble Lords who have criti-oised our action to understand is this:    That it isnot in -?ny lightheartod spirit, or otherwise thanfrom a sense of supreme necessity, that we haveadopted the programme of greatly increase? arablecultivation in this country, and that, howeverdifficult It may bo - and I admit that it is diffi-cult - there can be no insuperable obstacle toadding even as many as 10j,lk.&apos;g men to those engagedin agriculture if no are all resolved that the thingshall be o.one,I&apos;or my own-&apos;part I regard the matter as an abso-lutely vital ono.   I should not be willing to sharethe responsibility of the future unless a very greatincrease in the home production of food were to beeffected.   I could not myself face going on withoutit.   Therefore as I say,  JHe th?t -wills the end mustwill the means;1   and it Is absolutely incumbent,as it seems to me, upon the Government to solve theproblem which has been put before us to-day.   Theonly other possible course would be to admit thatthe problem was insoluble, pnd cancel the appealwhich hf:-.s been made to the farming community toriso to the occasion and make this great effortwhich has been asked of it.&quot;A few days later (May 25th), speaking in the House ofCommons on the adjournment for Whitsuntide, the PrimeMinister referred to the same subject in connection withthe submarine menace, in the following words:&quot;I say, after takios counsel of all those whoadvise me and after going into the figures veryoarefully&apos;, that if the nation economises, if the.  nation is not guilty of waste, if those who havegot land available for tho production of food makethe best use of it, if workmen turn out tractorsin order to help us to -plough, if^he^rmy^helg-us with all the^available men for the purpose ofcultivating the land - in fact, .if we.all behavelike reasonable human beings who want to savetheir country from disaster and from, privationfcnd distress, the submarine menace is not onethat need cause us any fear that the Lar is goingto be lost for that reason.&apos;-Commenting on these words of the Prime i-ilnister1 swhich it quoted in full in s leading article on thefollowing day, The Westminster Gazette said:&quot;If we venture to take exception to one - but-only one - of kr. Lloyd ieor^e1 s^h&amp;lf-dDzen &quot;ifs,&quot;it is because we think a point of no littlepractical importance is involved,   one of theconditions of security is that in The task of.
cultivating the land the Amy should help with all availablemen,     Eut there can, be no &quot;if&quot; about this.      The Army isnot an independent organisation possessing sovereign powersto which the Prime Minister need go humbly to make a request;I it is jpart of tho national organisation controlled by the T&quot;ari Council.      If that Council decides that the Army must lend tothe land all available men, the men must and will be lent.The order must be obeyed, though there nay fairly bei discussion (we do not say controversy) as to the exact number\ of men at any gityen period &quot;available.&quot;This argument of the &quot;Westminster Gazette seems a very fair one.The Army .cannot be expected to admit that it has any considerablenumber of men available for agriculture.     From the purelymilitary point of view there are no men to spare *     It is forthe Government to say, whether the necessity is such, that the menrequired must bo made available.As a matter of fact the military authorities have gone quiteas far as could possibly be expected in lending men to meet thedifficulties of the farmers.     Eut the assistance hithertorendered, which has been quite invaluable-, fallu far short ofwhat is necessary during the remainder of the year, and themilitary authorities are, very naturally from, their point ofvie--, not prepared to maintain   much less to increase thonumbers already lent without direct instructions from the Govofn-jnant.- -I fully sympathise with their difficulties and I shoui-  &quot;iketo acknowledge&quot;&apos; the reasonable and helpful spirit,  in which theyhave met me.&quot;as far as they felt they could do so consistentlywith their Primary obligations in the matter of Home Defence.which we have all along foreseen would have to be made on theall other means, known to me of increasing the supply ofagricultural labour;    (2) cut down,  in consultation with tho FoodProduction Drench of the Board of Agriculture,  the total demandfor such labour to tno lowest numbers with which it is possibleto cultivate &amp;bwmuch land as they feel sure of having all theother means of cultivating except labour,     It is important thatit should be understood that I have not been Working up to   &apos;3,000,000 or any other ideal number of acres of fresh arable landIt is quite certain that -tq shall not be able to break up any-t hi rig like that amount this year, though we can and ought tobreak up a large proportion of it.     -The basis of the followingcalculations is not the particular number of acr^s to be brokenfactors of the case,  such as machinery, horses, fertilisers,the time of year we have reached, the condition of the existingarable area, are absolutely indispensable if we are to get the&quot;largest quantity of food possible&quot;out of that area pluswhatever it is still practicable to break up.     My aim through-out has. been not to ask for one nan more than the number, whichthere is a reasonable certainty of being able to employprofitably in the production of food.up&quot;, but the numb3?ard to all the other
1The first and absolutely vital porm, is this - to stopany more Lien being taken away from agricultural work.     Thereis no doubt that too many have been taken already.     Basingpiyself on the last Cabinet decision on this subject Iaccordingly asked Lord Derby to issue general instructions tothe recruiting officers to take no more men from the landin England and Scotland except with the consent.of theAgricultural Committees.&quot;&apos; This proviso was intended to preventmen, ^;rho were not really indespensable, from merely takingshelter in agriculture to escape from military Service.The immediate loss canned to the Army by this measure isvery snail, as very nearly all the men due to the Army fromEngland and Scotland out of the 30.000 men &quot;engaged ingriculture&quot; who by the Cabinet oreei cf January 19th wereto he &quot;made available for genera] service,&quot; have already -beentaken.     Only one or two thousand me1&quot;, are involved, but thenoral effect of the concession is very considerable, as thecontinued withdrawal of men from agricultural work, at a time.:hen the farmers are at their wits end for labour and aresimultaneously being called upon to make a new and quiteexceptional effort, was creating a most deplorable impressionby discouraging the Agricultural Committees, and making thewhole rural community disbelieve in the sincerity of theGovernment&apos;s professions and exhortations.The absolute stoppage of the withdrawal of efficient, .vhole-time workers from agriculture,  at any rate till theperiod of extreme pressure is over -  that is: till nearly theend of the year - is indeed the essential condition of anyfurther progress in this matter.     Unless this is. adhered to,the whole policy fails,     So far from getting an increasedproduction of grain in this country we shall run a seriousrisk of a decrease.     But this concession, though it willhave an effect out of all proportion to the figures involved,411 go only a very little way in adding to the number ofagricultural workers.     At the lowest estimate we requiresomething like 70,000 additional men, of whom at least30,000 should be men of previous agricultural experience, inorder to turn to the production of grain the additionalquantity of land, -which can be devoted to that nurnose in thecereal year 191? - 1918.     These 70,000 will not all berequired at once, but they should be beginning to come innow and go on coming in at the rate of about 5,000 a weektill the end of September.
The Cabinet, when it last considered the question,&quot;recognised that military&apos;labour was the main possible sourceof supply, but considered it desirable that other sourcesshould&quot;.bo tapped., e.g. the&apos; interned enemy aliens and prisonersof war.&quot;     I have accordingly devoted a great deal of timeto inquiring into the possibilities of these sources andtrying to overcome the apparently innumerable obstacles, andprejudices, which stand in the way of the utilisation ofthese two classes of men.     At present there are only some800&apos; interned aliens who havo boon let out. for agriculturalwork., and an evon smaller number of prisoners of war.     Thofarmers wore very reluctant to ask for either of these classesof men, and the difficulties of getting thorn released andproperly looked after were considerable.     Nevertheless I amglad to say that, owing to the errtroaely satisfactory reports,which have boon received, especially about tho interned aliens,there is now more&apos;readiness on the part of the farmers to takethem, and, as I hope I havo succeeded in removing some of theDepartmental difficulties in the way of their employment, Ithink that henceforward a steady flow, or perhaps I shouldsay a steady tricklo into agriculturo from these two sourcesmay be relied upon.     It is impossible, however, to put thewhole figure very high.     I think it is a sanguine estimate thatwe may get 5,000 from each of these sources, say 10,000 in all,between now and the end of September;   and I think that possiblyan equal number may be got from tho miscellaneous sources ofsupply, such as labour Exchanges, National Service volunteers,etc., etc., though this again may be rather a sanguine estimate.The great difficulty of course is that, with tho tremendousdemand for labour in every direction and the enormous ratesof wages being paid, even the greatly advanced wages whichthe farmers can now afford to offer, and do offer, are insuffi-cient to attract spare labour from other employments.     It ispossible that later on, as other industries (except, of course,munitions and Government work generally) begin gradually tofall off owing to the. reduction of imported raw material, therewill be rather more labour available for agriculture from out-sido sources;   but for the present season 20,000 is the verymaximum which can be expected from these sources, and only asmall proportion of theso will bo men of agricultural, experience.This leaves some 50,000 men tc find, who can only be gotfrom the army.     The position as regards Army labour foragriculturo is the&apos; following:     During the early months ofthis year, as many as 40,000 men were at one time lent toagriculture from the Homo Defence forens, but of these 10,000being &quot;A&quot; men, have recently been withdrawn, and the bulk ofthe remainder, who belonged to lower categories and are thore-fore available for Home Defence only, are due to go back tothe colours on the 25th July.     Per the reasons already givenunder the head of tho stoppage of further recruiting, thesemen cannot possibly be allowed to go back at that date, unlessthey are replaced from tho same source, or unless we areprepared to deplete the ranks of agricultural labour at themost critical moment of the whole year.But even if these 22,000 are kept, or others substitutedfor them from the same source, we are no nearor getting the50,000 still lacking.     Just for the moment, the authoritiesat the Horse Guards have most generously set free 12,000 menfor the hay harvest, and have promised 5,000 men for tho cornharvest later on.     But the help which agriculture most requiresfrom the Army is not the temporary release of a number of men
for the harvest, though this is vory welcome, (inasmuch as itis comparatively easy to get labour for the harvest only frommiscellaneous sources in considerable amounts), but a steadyand gradually increasing influx of labour during the next3 months, on whioh it can count till the end of the agricul-tural Reason.     The-17,000 mon promised for the harvests donot help to supply this more enduring need.     On the other hand,if theso men were retained, noi merely for the period of thdharvests but for the whole agricultural season, they wouldgo some way to supplying it - I mean they would represent17,000 out of the 50,000 we are looking for.This leaves another 33,000 still to be found, of whomcertainly by for the greater number should be men alreadyhaving agricultural experience, or at least used to thehandling&apos;of horses, as it is very doubtful whether wo can countupon many such men in any of the groups already referred to,I put the number of experienced men re Quired, and not likelyto be found in any of these groups, at no loss than  5,000.Theso mon should be beginning to come in as soon as possiblo,as they are chiefly needed for ploughing, end the next 6 weeksere very important from this point of view.     I asked FieldMarshal French whet he could do in the way of providing skilledploughmen, and his reply is that there are only 2,320 skilledploughmen in the force under his commend, and of thoso 680 aroalready included in tho mon now being   roleased for the hayharvest.     I have asked him that in addition the remaining1,640 men at least should bo reserved for agriculture, but thisof courso goes only a very little way to meet the case.Of course if no men of previous agricultural experience aroavailable, the farmers will have to be satisfied with any sortof menphysically capable of agricultural work, though it isobvious that the result will not be so good.     But I am notsatisfied that, even if tho Home Defence Force cannot providesuch men, the Armyjas^a^hole camiot provide thorn, without anyreduction oT its   fighting&quot; strength.     And I think it is upontho i*rmy as a whole, that is upon the Secretary of State andthe Army Council that the demand should be made for the labour,which wo cannot got from any other source.     I have no doubt,that, in practice, it is tho Home Defence Forco, which will bemainly drawn upon for this purpose.     But I do not think thatthe Cabinet can determine from what part of the Army tho menshould be drawn.     It is for the military authorities to settleamongst themselves, how they can be supplied with the leastdetriment to tho Army.     They have got some      million monin all at their disposal - roughly speaking 2 millions abroadand lijr million   at home (I am not, of course., including .Oolonial and Indian troops.     That tho requirements of agricul-ture can be met out of these numbers is not Questionable.     Butit is only the military authorities who can say how this canbest be done.To Sum up, my proposals, as far as the Army is concerned,are the following :-il)     That no more -whole-time workers should bo taken from;the land except with the consent of the County AgriculturalCommittees.
12) .       That the men:now lent to agriculture till the 2?thJuly should he allowed&apos;to remain after that date, exceptin so far as they are replaced by other men of the samequalityi3) Jfihat in addition to the above the Army should becalled upon to furnish 2,000 men a week for 10 weeks,beginning with the 1st week of July, the five; first -contingents to be men of. previous agricultural oxpori-cnco, or in any case men used to handling&apos;horse1&apos;-.&apos;All these men,, like those in (.2) should be allowedto remain in agricultural work^ unless replaced by othersof the same quality.&apos;?&apos;   Tho 17,600 men promised by the . -Army for the hay and. corn harvests, or as many of them .as may be allowed to remain in agriculture when thOsrihawosts arc over,  should bo regarded as a deductionfrom the number to be furnished by the Army in the 5&quot;latter weeks.     Thus, if all these men should be allowedto Remain, the number to be then furnished during thatperiod would h&amp; 8,000 in all, instead of 2^,000.Finally I would propose that all these arrangements shouldbe subject tc review at tho .end of the yoar.     By. that timo theason of greatest pressure in agricultural work will bo over,and wo shall know precisely&apos; how much arable land we havoactually got) and how many men will be required for itsproper cultivation.     Tb is possible that the embargo on  -recruiting from agriculture im^y then safely bo removed,, or-thatsome of the men lent to agriculture by the. Army may bedispensed with.     In any case, it should be clearly, understoodthat any men retained, or. placed at tho disposal of agricultureunder the above proposals, are lent; not given.-     They remain , .nembers of the Army, can be exchanged at any time by the -Armyfor men of the same quality, and, in any case, are liable to.iromediato recall to the colours,, without being replaced,, inthe case cf real emergency, such as invasion or imminent-throatof invasion.     Of. course it is desirablo to disturb them aslittle as possible in their agricultural work, and I have nodoubt that the military authoritiesj who have shown&apos; such -eminent goodwill in the&apos;matter hitherto,/will not do socept. in case of absolute necessity.  -- The point to note is that though agriculture has per-    -Isanent.need of:a definite - number of men, and though no large&quot;agricultural programme can be carried out without certaintyin this respect, it is&apos; not by any moans-.necessary that they v.   .jshould always be the same men.     Of course the fo&quot;Tcr changesJthe -better, from the agricultural point of view, but farmers willBust have to put up with changes if they are.inevitable-.-1- can conceive that it might greatly facilitate&apos; the provision ofHjho men, from the Army point of view, if they.were only releasedmyom the colours, for a definite period,, being replaced by other-n, similarly released, at the end of it.
