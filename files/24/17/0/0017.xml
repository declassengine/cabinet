TheWar Committee approved this recommendation..In April last the Italian Government put forward a re-quest for 500*000 rounds of this ammunition, but in.view of thelimitation imposed by the decision cf the Cabinet that thebullets in question were only to be used within this country, therequest was refused.The Italian Government have now asked whether therewould be any objection to their being supplied with the infcrma-tion necessary to enable them to manufacture the incendiaryammunition for themselves.    The matter has been considered bythe Air Board, and I am to state that the Service Members bfthe Board, on the general grounds indicated in Lord Curzon&apos;smemorandum,  think it inadvisable that the information askedfor should be supplied.I am to ask for a ruling cf the War Cabinet on thesubject.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd)    H. P. HARVEY.
