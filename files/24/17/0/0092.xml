JUDGES AID DIRECTORSHIPS-. -.......... *Questions have- been asked in the House of Oomnona recentlydirecting attention to the fact that one of the Judges On theScottish Bench holds a directorship in a trading company.The Judge in question is Lord Salvesen:   the company is theArizona Copper Company:   and the directorship is said to be worth 800 a year.Public attention has been drawn to the matter, and a good dealof feeling has been aroused.    The general opinion, both among thepublic and among Lord Salvesenfs colleagues in the Court of Session,is that it is improper that a Judge should hold such an appointment.Incidentally, attention has boen called to the fact that othorScottish Judges hold what are called &quot;Extraordinary Directorships&quot;of banking companies.      These appointments are purely ornamental,implying neither participation in the management nor the drawingof fees.      They are held by seven Judges out of thirteen.    SomeJudgos have, however, thought it proper to resign even these director-ships on appointment to-the Bench.    The Lord President (LordStrathclyde) is not a director.Lord Salvesen has been pressed to give up his directorship bythe Lord President, but he has so far declined,,to do so,    He thinksthe criticism unreasonable, and sees no impropriety in his retainingthe position.    He would, however, I am informed, be disposed toreconsider the matter if he were informed that the Government as awholo took exception to Judges holding directorships, and if-resig--nation of such offices were made a condition of future appointments.A notice of motion in the House of Commons has been put downby Mr \7att in the following terms;-Court
;&apos;Court of Session (Appointment of Judges) - To call attentionto one fact that several Judges of the Court of Session in Scotlandhold directorships of banks, &quot;insurance companies, and tradingconcerns, all of which companies, as well as other companies in thesame trades or lines of business, are frequent litigants in the eomn*.of these Judges;   that on that account, the public of Scotland areunder the impression, rightly or wrongly, that even-handed justicecannot be administered to them whenever the interests of these com--panies or of these particular trades or lines of business areconcerned;   that pressure brought to bear on the litigants to con sonto such Judges trying their cases, although so interested, does notsolve the difficulty, as the public fear that refusal to comply.withsuch pressure would lead to worse consequences;   and to move, Thatthis House expresses the view that in future appointments of Judgesto the Court of Session it&apos;be an absolute condition that no director-- ships be held by the Judges so appointed&quot;.While it is unlikely that time will be available for the dis--cussion of this kotion, the matter will certainly be further pressedby questions in the House.I have discussed it fully with the Lord Advocate and the LordPresident of the Court of Session, who are in full agreement with myview that the holding of a directorship in a trading company by aJudge is most undesirable.     So far as my personal opinion goes, Ishould be prepared, in the event of Lord Salvesen continuing in hispresent attitude, to support any proceedings in thi- House designedwith the object of terminating the possibility of a Judge acting inthis way.Before, however, committing myself further in the matter, Ithink it is essential that I should know the attitude of the Cabinetwith regard to the matter.      I have been specially asked, by the Lor;President to inform him of the view entertained by the Government asto Judges holding ordinary directorships and of their attitude tokr \7att&apos;s kotion.    As regards England, I understand there have beencases in which,an English Judge has held an ordinary insurancedirectorship, but that at present no such case exists and that noSngLish Judge holds a commercial directorship.      There wouldobviously be a difficulty in laying down a rule for Scotland whichdid not aonlv all round.
The further question may arise whether it is desirable toindicate any opinion -in re^rd to the &quot;Extraordinary Directorships&quot;,such as those mentioned above.    It would be very difficult (even ifthere *&quot;ere any competent authority to lay down a rule) to draw adefinite line between what may and what may not be admissible.    Asregards the Civil Service, a working compromise was effected by theterms of the Orders in Council dealing with the Service, whichinclude a provision that &quot;no officer shall be allowed to accept any&quot;part in the management of any society, or any trading, commercial,&quot;industrial, or financial firm or company, which would require the&quot;attendance of such officer at any time between the hours of 10 a.m.&quot;and 6 p.m.B.      No such rule could be laid down for an existingJudge, so far as I am aware, without specific statutory authority:but it might be possible, if it were considered desirable, to insertsome limiting conditions in a Judge&apos;s Commission in future cases.    Ican, however, conceive considerable objection being taken to such acourse as derogatory to the dignity of the Bench.    An intimation inthe House of Comnons from the head of the Government that he consideredthat a Judge should not hold directorships might be sufficient.I should add that this is not the first time this matter hasarisen.    On the 6th July, 1908, Hr Asquith informed kr %tt that&quot;it seoned to him to be highly undesirable that a member of the Bench&quot;should take an active part in the direction of a commercial company&quot;.On the 21st July, 1908, kr Asquith, whose attention had beencalled to the case of Lord Salvesen, said:-&quot;I have no reason to suppose that the practice referred to by&quot;ray hon. Friend is of frequent occurrence but I understand that the&quot;statement in reference to the Arizona Company is correct.      I havealready stated my view, that participation by a member of the Benchin
&quot;in the direction of trading concerns is highly undesirablea.&quot;Ix WATT: Will the right hon. Gentleman answer the last part&quot;of my question as to future appointments?    Which is the most&quot;important - that a Judge or a Cabinet Minister should not be a&quot;company director?&quot;-&quot;Mr ASQUITH:   I think it more important that the Judge should&quot;not,    (Hansard, 21st July, 1908)&quot;I submit the matter for the consideration of the Cabinet0   Iregret that they should be troubled with a question of this natureat this time.Scottish Office, .26th June, 1917.&apos;
