17 A ftGAB I&apos; I S I.Note by the Minister of Munitions onLord. DerbyTs Memorandum of the 7th* June on the Positionand Prospects of Recruiting..I attach a note by Sir Stephenson Kent onthe points raised in the Adjutant-General*s Memorandumon Recruiting so far as they affect the Ministry ofMunitions.-I should like to draw attention to thecontributions of recruits made from munitions works whichare not mentioned in the Memorandum,.The figures of release under what Is knownas the Substitution Scheme up to May 25th. show thatthere were released up to that time 18.525 men.   Wefind from the Returns from only 4,000 controlledestablishments that from January 12th. to April 13th.31,750 men joined the Colours,   when it is rememberedthat 2.5,000 firms held war service badges, it seemsclear that there must, have been a large contributionfrom firms outside the 4,000 controlled establishments,but I am not able to give figures for these.VJith/
With regard to the releases under theSchedule of Protected Occupations, I note that thevAdjutant-Generalrs Memorandum is dated May 31st, andthat the Table on page 5* is made up to May 25th.I should point out that by the decision of the WarCabinet tho Schedule did not come into operationuntil May 7th. and that thereafter it was necessaryto set up an elaborate organisation all over thecountry to carry out the scheme, which involved, interalia, the establishment in working order of sixty-sisthatEnlistment Complaints Committees0   I find/under thisscheme up to June 7th, the names of 70,000 men have&apos;been handed to the Army Authorities for examinationso that the fact that only one record had come throughby May 25th,. is not a measure of the real progressof the scheme.,&apos;   The limitations which were introduced in the&apos; scheme for working the Schedule in the conferencespresided over by Mr., Henderson and accepted byrepresentatives oftho War Office and ourselves, asSir Stephenson Kent has pointed out, are necessarilylimiting the soope and rapidity of its application.II
I entirely associate myself with, thesuggestions made in Sir Stephsnson KontTs Memorandum,and, in view of the present industrial situation,I think it would he most inadvisable in the nearfuture to contemplate any alteration in the methodarranged for.23rd, June. 1917*
She only paragraphs of the AdjutantMjenjexaLrs  -memorandum on which any comments appear to he calledfor from the Minister of Munitions are paragraphs 9,18, ,19 and 30.Paragraph 9 (c).It is stated that of the 50,000 semi-skilledand unskilled munitions workers fit for generalmilitary service who were to have been released bythe end of January, only 12,000 had been receivedby the Army up to the 20th May.   The figures ofrelease under what ?/as kno7/n as tho SubstitutionScheme, suppliod to the Minister of Munitions bythe &quot;Employment Department, showed that the totalnumber of men released for the Amy up to the25th. May under the scheme were 18..525.,. This schemeof cnurse was practically superseded when theSchedule of Protected Occupations came into operationon the -/th May.   It is hardly profitable no?? to gointo tho reasons why moro men were not released underit. - &apos;The main reason was delay in medical examination,which is dealt with by the War Office;, and not by theMinistry of Munitions,It must be pointed out, however, that whethertho correct figure for mon released under this schemeand under the direction as to the release of men aged18 to 22 was 12,COO or 18,000, this figure does notrepresent anything like the total number of men.released for the Army from Munitions work during theperiod.:  The Ministry of Munitions have no completeinformation/
225W ni *J-. 2  - ; J   ,information as to this total,, but returns from 4,000rcontrolled establishments show that during the periodJanuary 12th. to April 13th.. from those establishmentsalone 31,750 men joined the Colours.     When it isremembered that the number of firms who hold war service -badges was about 25,000 and that there were many otherfirms engaged on munitions- work who had never beenbadged, it is obvious that the contribution of munitionswork to recruitment during the first five months of1917 has been not inconsiderable.Paragraph 18.In viev/ of the recommendations nado inparagraph 30 of the Memorandum, it is advisable to sotout the reasons why more of the quota to be releasedfrom Den badgod by the Ministry of Munitions had notbeen obtained up to the 25th May.     Sliey aro:-(a) Delay in bringing the Schedule ofProtected Occupations Into operation.    Thefirst draft was submitted to lord Rhondda&apos;sCommittee- early in March but it wasnot tillthe brginning of April that it was possible toconsult the Unions and it was not until the7th May that the Schedule came into operation.In view of. the labour situation all effortshad then to be concentrated on the issue ofthe certificates which were tc replace badgecertificates/.
certificates and Trade Cards.   The machinery-was new and untried and the men who wereworking it were necessarily inexperienced of it.However effective the scheme nay he initself, and however willing and competent themen who are working- it, there is unavoidabledelay in showing results, for many of the menliable for recruitment have to be medicallyexamined; when their medical category isascertained and a calling up notice is issued,they have 14 days before they need report;and it is open to any man to appeal to theEnlistment Complaints Sub-Committee, to theEnlistment Complaints Committee, and theTribunal.   Statistical information as to thefigures of the scheme is necessarily incomplete,but up to June 7th. somo 70,000 names had beenhanded to the Army Authorities for mediealexamination and about 3,200 men had beenreleased.   In addition, a certain number of menare known to have been released from munitionswork through other channels to the Army duringMay.The concessions which the Government found itnecessary, with the cognisance of the War Office,to mako to tho A*S*j3* and other Trade Unions, theeffect of which on recruitment has been twofold*Firstly, the younger men in Scheduled Occupationswhom/
*m    4:    *&quot;*whom tha Sehedulo was designed to release,are to all intents and purposes completelyprotected &quot;by the promise as to the priorremoval of dilutees.   Secondly^ until theSchedule is revised, men of 32 and overcannot &quot;be recruited from munitions work,The promise was given that before theSchedule was revised Trade Unions shouldhe consulted.   It is a matter for the Government*s&quot;decision whether in the present temper oflabour it would he wise to call a conferenceav an e^rly date with the Unions and roopenthis subject,!Phe importance of these two. restrictions will be realised when it is romemberedthat, as the Ministry of Munitions pointed outwhen the Schedule was under consideration,there is no possibility of obtaining thequota required to be furnished from munitionswork&apos;unless practically all semi-skilledand unskilled men liable and fit for&apos; generalmilitary service are recruited from munitionswork up to tho ago of 41, and unless theyounger skilled men whom the Schedule wasdesigned to release in certain occupationsare also rocruitod.(d)/
(&amp;) The complete proteotion fromrecruitment given to men engaged onmarine engineering, including unskilledand semi-skilled men.I hope that the Adjutant-General, in spiteof what he says in paragraph 24 about &quot;the regrettableinertness&quot; of Government Departments with regard torecruiting, will agree that the Labour SupplyDepartment of the Ministry of Munitionshave done all that was in their power to co-operatewith the Director of Recruiting in expediting andfacilitating the release of men under the Schedule.The delay in releasing the men and the impossibilityunder existing conditions of releasing the fullquota, are not due to any lack of willingness oreffort on the part of the Ministry of Munitions..Paragraph 30.As to Suggestion (1), what has been saidabovo should make it clear that the Ministry ofMunitions are proceeding as rapidly as possible withtho release of men under the Schedule, but that toobtain the quota fixed for release from munitionswork, the-Government should be prepared to faceserious trouble with the Unions, and further; thatapart from any question of labour unrest thecomplete protection at present accorded to men ofany or no skill engaged on Admiralty work, willalso act as an effective bar.As/
As to Suggestion 4 (e), certain of themen who formerly held &quot;badge certificates, unlessthey had lodged an appeal with the Tribunal by the21st May (i.e. 14 days from the date on which thecancellation of the, badge certificate took place),would now appear to have no legal right of appeal toa Tribunal on personal grounds in the event oftheir being called up.   If this position is strictlyenforced and Tribunals are not allowed to considerappeals on personal grounds from men who formerlyheld badge certificates, the Government nay lieunder the charge of a breach of faith with thoTrade Unions, for the Schedule oxpressly statesthat the new procedure does not preclude anapplication to the Local Tribunal under the .regulations and instructions for the tine beingin force.I an not clear that the Department shouldcomment upon Suggestion (5), but the proposal thatall men of a certain age should be recruited if fitrfor general service has obvious recommendations.   Themethod is simple, intelligible, uniform and certain.It could only work however if it were made to apply toall men without exception.   I do not know whether theAdmiralty could see their way to agree.     I an surethat the Director of Aeronautical Supplies would offerstrong opposition and it is certain that any suchuriforn rule would, for a time at any rate, greatlydiminish the output of many of the most essentialmunitions,/
munitions, such as ships an6 guns, aeroplanes, andtanks.-.  If the age were fixed as high as 25, it wouldtake a very long time indeed for output to recover.&apos;But I am quite clear if any such scheme is put intooperation, the only reason that should protect menfrom being recruited should be unfitness for GeneralService; any other procedure is in effect amodification of to-day1s system under the Scheduleof Protected Occupations and will lead to the sameprotracted negotiations, misunderstandings andlabour unrest which has in the past characterisedany change of method of protection or recruitment.(Intd), S,K.19,6.17,
