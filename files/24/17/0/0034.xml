PEIMARK.  he Danish Delegates arrived in London early in theweek and verbal negotiations have proceeded on numerous out-standing questions, e*g. the utilisation of Danish ton-nage, restriction of imports and of fish exports etc.It is almost certain that the Danish harvestincluding hay and roots, will be a complete failure andthat the Danish farmers will consequently be compelledgreatly to reduce their stocks of horses, cattle and pigs.Sir R. Paget thinks the moment opportune for us to reeon-sider our policy.     We have hitherto sought to diminishthe exports of livestock to Germany;   bpt if,there is afodder famine this will be difficult.   Export to thiscountry on a large scale is impracticable.   Scandinaviacannot absorb the surplus stock;   purchase for retention in?;:Denmark would be not only costly but dangerous, since itinvites invasion;   moreover It necessitates continued im-ports of fodder.   The alternative Sir R. Paget suggestsis that we should acquiesce in, or even encourage, theimmediate export of the surplus liv estockto Gemany.Germany has nearly tided over the critical months beforethe harvest, and it would be better for her to have thestock now than hereafter, when her need will be greater.We would still aim at diminishing the horse exports and ataincreasing the slaughtering of cattle and pigs beforeexport.   But all fodder imports into Denmark would bestopped.   Before a decision is taken an expert will besent to Denmark to report upon the fodder prospects andupon the wiole agricultural position.
Germany has offered the Danish Government immunityfrom attack for our produce boats outside the dangergone in return for 10,000 horses and an undertaking thatthe cargoes seized from the &quot;Storebelt&quot; and &quot;Olara&quot; willnot be deducted from hep share of the produce.The reply received from the Norwegian Shipowners *Association to our tonnage proposals is satisfactory uponthe main points and the lorwegian Pr3me Minister andMinister for Foreign Affairs hope that an agreement hasnow been reached.   They wish us at once to begin snpply-ing coal to lorway in requisitioned British vessels, andthey agree to our proceeding to requisition the Norwegianvessels which are employed in the Horth Sea trade.   Theyexpect that the agreement will be popular in lorway whenit is realised that it has effected a substantial savingin the cost of coal.   The Shipping Delegates willpostpone tbeir visit until a number of lorwegian vesselshave been requisitioned and it can be seen what questionscall for discussion.The Norwegian Government wish to increase by 25$the maximum prices of fish purchaseable by us under thefish Agreement.   We shall delay our reply until theattitude of the United States as in the supply of food-staffs to Scandinavia is determined.Hearly 38,000 tons of British goods, in additionto 8,000 tons of agricultural machinery from the UnitedStates, are awaiting transit to Bnssia through Sweden.The Swedish Railway authorities say that owing to theshortage of coal they cannot transport more than 3,000
- 2 -Germany has offered the Danish Government immunityfrom attack for our produce boats outside the dangerzone in re tarn for 10,000 horses and an undertaking thatthe cargoes seized from the &quot;Storebelt&quot; and &quot;Clara&quot; willnot be deducted from her share of the produce.The reply received from the Norwegian Shipowners&quot;Association to our tonnage proposals is satisfactory uponthe main points and the Norwegian Prime Minister andMinister for Poreign Affairs hope that an agreement hasnow been reached.   They wish us at once to begin supply-ing eoal to Norway in requisitioned British vessels, andthey agree to our proceeding to requisition the Norwegianvessels which are employed in the North Sea trade.   Theyexpect that the agreement will be popular in Uorway whenit is realised that it has effected a substantial savingin the cost of coal.   The Shipping Delegates willpostpone their visit until a number of Norwegian vesselshave been requisitioned and it can be seen what questionscall for discussion.The Norwegian Government wish to increase by 25$the maximum prices of fish purchaseable by us under thePish Agreement.   We shall delay our reply until theattitude of the United States as to the supply of food-staffs to Scandinavia is determined.Nearly 38,000 tons of British goods,, in additionto 8,000 tons of agricultural machinery from the UnitedStates, are awaiting transit to Russia through Sweden.The Swedish Railway authorities say that owing to theshortage of ooal they cannot transport more than 3,000
tons a week.   We have frequently pointed out t) the SwedishGovernment that ample supplies of coal ean he obtainedfrom this country if Swedish vessels are sent to fetchthem.   The Swedish Government are anxious that thedetained grain vessels should he more rapidly releasedthan our agreement stipulates;   we are prepared to accedeto their request if Sweden will afford adequate transitfacilities for Russian goods.Swedish exports to Germany of iron and sawn timbercontinue to increase.   Germany now receives five tons ofSwedish iron for every ton sold to this country.The Swedish War Risk Commission have increased theinsurance rate on the ruund voyage to this country from13$ to 20$. /NETHERLANDS. There- is reason to believe that, on account of theshortage of fodder, the Dutch Government contemplateexporting to Germany 250,000 head of cattle.   We haveinformed the United States Government, and our Ambassadorhopes that they will warn the Dutch Government that ifthe idea is not abandoned future supplies of foodstuffsand fodder from the United States will be imperilled,SWITZERLAND. Sir H. Rumbold expects that the Swiss will strictlyobserve their obligation under the new German-SwissAgreement not to permit German coal or coke to be usedby the factories which produce military supplies for theAllies.   Hitherto these factories have drawn half theirfuel requirements from Germany.   We must be prepared tomake this goody otherwise our supplies will suffer.
(ITALY. The United States Government have agreed to parti-( eipate   in the purchase of the exportable surplus ofItalian thrown silk arising from the cessation of theexport trade to Germany.The increasingly large shipments of Cotton fromthe United States to Genoa have been noted with somemisgivings by the United States Government, who haveasked wither we are satisfied with the Italian control.We have been able to reassure then as in cotton destinedfor Italy, but we sball welcome their assistance inrestricting doubtful consignments to Switzerland by therefusal of licences for Swiss firms who are on the FrenchBlack Mst.GREECE. The blockade was raised by M. Jonnart on the 15thinst.*In order to avoid depressing our exchange on Greece),we are retaining for the present the Greek funds whichwere immobilised here when the blockade was declared.   TheGreek Government mill be required to limit their demandson tonnage to bare necessaries.    At present 110 Greekvessels, out of a total mercantile marine of 135, are inAllied service.4 SPAIN. The Spanish Government have authorised the exportof 40,000 tons of Potatoes to this country;   they willbecome available at the rate of 1,500 to 2,000 tons a day.Spain is largely increasing her purchases of ecpperfrom the United States; this may be due in uneasiness as .to future supplies or to an intention to accumulate stocks(\ for re-export to the enemy after the war.     Our Ministerwill make enquiries.
(), JAPAN.A translation of the Japanese Ordinances for theprevention of trade with the enemy which came into forceson the 14th May has been received.   Loyally administeredthe Ordinances should prove effective;   but the provisionmade for trade by lieenoe with enemies in China and Siamoffers scope for abuse.    The Japanese Government s\foopethat we will now remove Japanese subjects from the Chinaand Siam Black lists.0. QCCUT11%) TERRITORY.   The German Authorities requisitioned on the10th instt all stocks in Belgium of a variety ofarticles such as Alum, various forms of ioda and potash,nitrates and nitric acid, chromates, sulphates and leadsalts etc.l* HHITEP STATES.    The Export Restrictions Bill having successfullypassed Congress, it is hoped that the licensing systemfor neutral European countries will be put in operationearly in July.   It may be some time before the systemcan be extended to South, America, but the United StatesGovernment have meanwhile called for reports from theirrepresentatives upon the activities of enemy firms andAmerican shipping lines are in practice observing ourStatutory list.   The Department of Commerce intend toretain a free hand to refuse licences for goods acceptedby our Embassy at Washington under the navicerjj scheme.The June purchases for the account of the teatCommission amount to 1,600,000 tons, of tfeieh 1,100,000tons will be shipped immediately.   The July purchasesat present anount to 305,000 tons, with a further75,000 tons in sight.
