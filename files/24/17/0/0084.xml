L- WAR CABINET.^603.Reprisals.Note by the Secretary of State for War.With reference to War Cabinet 13G (if), I circulate thesubjoined opinion of the Law Officers on the case of Fritz Patzel.DERBY.25th June, 1917.&quot;We are clearly of the opinion that the finding of theCourt Martial was justified.   Moreover, the fact that the GermanGovernment think it necessary, in support of their application fora revision of sentence, to allege that members of the British PoliceForce who escorted the prisoners carried dum-dum cartridges may bethought to indicate that they also have little doubt as to Patzel&apos;sguilt.   It is significant that this allegation was not made in theNote of the 10th June 1916\ hot in Wellensiek&apos;s sworn statement ofthe 24th March 1916, although it is made in his report of the l6thMarch 1916.   As to the statement that Lieut.Colonel Zimmerman gaveorders forbidding the use of soft-nosed bullets, it may be asked whysuch an order was thought necessary unless the troops were in thehabit of using them.Patzel pleaded guilty to the possession of the bullets,and this fact, taken together with the fact that our wounded werehit by such bullets during the attack in question and on otheroccasions, would be, in our opinion sufficient to justify thefinding of the Court Martial.    Otherwise the enemy could use dum-dumbullets with impunity, because it would be impossible, save inquite exceptional cases, to prove that a particular prisoner hadused them, however general the use of them by the enemy might be.&quot;
