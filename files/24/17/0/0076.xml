Since the men have not in fact beenreleased, there has naturally been no demand for substitutes, and, as stated above,there does not appear to be any likelihood of such a demand in the near future.This conclusion has led me to consider the whole position of the National ServiceDepartment, which, through no fault of its own. is faced with the prospect of havingto mark time so far as substitution is concerned for an indefinite period.When I accepted office no definition of my functions or powers was given to me,but I understood that I was appointed for the purpose of controlling and regulatingthe supply of labour for the various national services, the assumption being that thesupply was unequal to the sum of the demands.

To find the explana-tion of this fact it is necessary to go back to the original purpose of their enrolment.
In the first part of my first Report to the Cabinet, dated 13th January, 1917 Irecommended that to meet the immediate needs of the Army, all Governmentexemptions to men born in the years 1895. 1896, 1897, and 1898 should be cancelledforthwith, and I stated that this measure was estimated to yield 280,000 men fit forGeneral Service. In the second part of the Report I outlined my proposals for raisingan industrial army &quot; in order to provide the substitutes necessary to replace men witk-drawn from civil life for military purposes in consequence of the procedure described inPart 7.&quot; The Cabinet accepted my recommendation as to the men of 18 to 22, butexcluded from its operation every industry in which any considerable number of menwas to be found, and further limited the release to men classed in Category A. In hismemorandum the Adjutant-General states that &quot; to the 25th May the number of menposted for Military Service as a result of this decision is negligible.&quot; The result uponthe demand for National Service Volunteers is obvious. The men were not taken forthe Army, consequently substitutes were not required and employers were never sopressed as to induce them to overcome their natural disinclination to take into theirworks men whose special terms of employment might exercise a disturbing influence ontheir existing starts.In my second Report, dated 3rd February,&apos;1917, I represented to the Cabinet thattheir previous decision as to men of 18 to 22 was not likely to produce more than atrifling number of men, and I stated that if men were to be obtained in time tobe trained and sent to the front as planned by the Army Council, this could only bedone by prompt and drastic measures. I suggested the cancellation of all Governmentexemptions up to the age of 31, and the publication of the dates when various age groupswould be called up, so that employers might make the necessary adjustments.The Report was discussed by the Cabinet on the 5th February, but the suggestionswere not adopted.On the 21st March Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee, which had been appointed toconsider the general question of man-power, recommended that 250,000 men should bereleased for military service by certain Departments in monthly instalments during thefour months April to July. The Committee expressed the opinion that it was of &quot; vitalimportance&quot; that these men should be withdrawn in advance of the provision ofsubstitutes, but they considered that substitutes would have eventually to be found fora large number of the men withdrawn, and they supported a proposal from me underwhich, in addition to the original National Service Volunteers, appeals should be madeto Committees of employers and employed in organised trades for substitutionvolunteers.As already pointed out, the recommendations of the Rhondda Committee have not,and are not likely to produce appreciable numbers of men for the Army. I find myself,therefore, for the second time, in the position of having made arrangements to providesubstitutes who are not wanted because the requirements of the army are not beingmet.Whatever objections may have existed in January and February to my proposalsfor the cancellation of Government exemptions and the calling up of men for militaryservice by age groups without regard to occupation and subject only to Tribunalappeals, there is no doubt that the risks and difficulties are greater now. The Russianrevolution, accusations of profiteering, general war weariness, and the protracteddifficulties in connection with the abolition of the Trade Card Scheme and theintroduction of the Dilution Bill have rendered labour irritable and suspicious.Nevertheless, I wish to repeat my conviction that the policy which I have twicesubmitted to the Cabinet is the only one which will quickly and certainly provide themen required for the army, and that, further, it is one which would commend itselfto the majority of the people in this country as, on the whole, the fairest aU round. Iwould, however, strongly emphasise my view that to have any chance of acceptance itmust apply to every industry, including agriculture and shipbuilding. If once anexception is allowed rival claims to the privilege will be set up and the old ranklingsense of injustice will follow. Discretion might, indeed, be allowed to the militaryauthorities to leave in civil life any men who were considered indispensable, but thedecision should rest with them alone, and doubtless the latitude thus given would beapplied chiefly to those in the lower medical categories.At the same time, I am convinced that, provided a short time were allowed foradjustment, employers would make their own arrangements for keeping up theiroutput.The adoption of this policy would at once result in a demand for substitutes,which could be placed in the hands of the Local Trades and National Service
Committees already set up. Short of it, I see no prospect of any considerabledemands upon my Department for labour other than for agriculture, and I would pointout that, if presently I have to tell the Committees that after all the trouble they havetaken and the enthusiasm they have displayed in making arrangements to meet thenew proposals there turns out to be nothing for them to do, bitter disappointment anddisillusionment will result. The Committees will dissolve, and it will be impossibleto revive them.Nor in that case can I see any justification for the continued existence of thisDepartment. The only remaining work of importance would be that connected withagriculture, and, valuable as I believe that work to be, it could hardly be consideredextensive enough, if it stood alone, to warrant its being constituted a separateDepartment from the Board of Agriculture. The work of the Women&apos;s section wouldhave to be split up amongst various Departments, including the War Office, Board ofAgriculture, and the Ministry of Labour. The machinery of substitution, includinga large number of area and sub-area officers, might be abolished or drastically reducedand retransferred to the War Office. The adjudication of disputes between the WarOffice and other Government Departments as to the release of their staff and theemployes of firms doing Government work would have to be transferred to some otherauthority.N. 0.June 22, 1917.
