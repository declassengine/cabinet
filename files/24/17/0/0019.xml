The outdoor staff is engaged in organising the- potato-spraying campaign in the districts for which they areresponsible.     Good progress is being made.Reports were received last week that vast swarmsof caterpillars in the peak 3)1strict were devastating the hillpastures and were marching in a processionary manner in thevalley moadows and that oat fields and other crops werethreatened.     The reports were sensational and alarming.     TheDistrict Inspectors for the Korth and the Midlands wereaccordingly instructed to -visit and report, and what stepswere taken to procure from the Food Production Department tenspraying machines and a supply of arsenate of lead for thepurpose of ejjraying the rough grass so as to prevent anyfurther development of the infestation.     Two long reportshave been received which indicate that the reports areexaggerated and that the plague is not likely to spread muchfurther.    The caterpillar in question is that of the AntlerMoth (Charaeas graminis), a well known and common psst ofmoorland pasture.     Ito prevalence appears to be due to theexceptionally severs weather last Winter having protected theeggs from their natural enemies, while the recent hot weatherhas deprived them of the usual food and induced them tomigrate.The Inspectors of the Horticulture Branch willcontinue to keep observation on the infestation, and will sprayif necessity arises, but it is not anticipated that much harmwill be done as the caterpillars will pupate very soon.It is worth recording that lar^e numbers of thesepests have been destroyed by rooks and seagulls which haveflocked to the spot in great numbers.     It is to be hoped thatnothing will be done to kill these birds.Publications Branch.wpnyjnwti i limn mi    ii-1 i      ii  i ii - miimiiw?-1mmThe number of applications for ordinary issues of theleaflets was 1010, in response to which 13,233 copies of leafletswere despatched.
