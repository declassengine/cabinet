9379.   Reference paragraph 26 of your Military Despatch Io.3B,Dated 20th April.    There are two separate incidents which formedsubject of allegations against Murphy, the former in respect of hisconduct about 11th January, the latter concerning events subsequentto &amp;Lst January.    With regard to former it appears that specificindictment of Murphy *s conduct was not made to Aylmer nor was hisname mentioned.    Aylmer however instructed his administrative staffto institute enquiries into the general complaints of neglect ofwounded and it is improbable that Murphy&apos;s conduct did not come withintheir cognisance in this connection.   With regard to latter caseevidence is definite that lylmer investigated allegations againstMurphy and decided that they were not proved.Having above in view and as we are precluded from making useof evidence before Mesopotamia Commission for purpose of takingdisciplinary action against Murph y who was not present when evidencewas recorded and who has not been afforded opportunity of examinationof witnesses there appears to be two alternatives before us (1) todecline to reopen case (3) to order fresh court of enquiry in Indiaor Mesopotamia.    latter course would necessitate collection ofmaterial witnesses now scattered.    After lapse of eighteen monthsit would in our opinion be impossible for any court.to appreciateat their true value the facts which weighed with responsiblemilitary authorities on the spot at the time allegations wereinvestigated.   Before arriving at decision we would be glad tolearn your views as to any general policy to be adopted with referenceto adverse criticism of individuals by Mesopotamia Commission.
