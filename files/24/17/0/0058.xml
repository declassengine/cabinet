SECRET.DEPARTMENT   OP   INFORMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.FIB/004WEEKLY   REPORT   ON   ITALY   IV.June 23,   1917. .International Relations.The Italian proclamation of Albanian Independenceand the occupation of Yannina were at once officially an-nounced.    Of certain further occupations in the directionof the Gulf of Arta no public notice has been ?;iven.     Theoccupation (reported on June 11th by the British Consul atYannina) of Metsovo - commanding the entrance to the MetsovoPass leading to Thessaly and the passes leading northwardsto the Saloniki road via Grevena - may be regarded as, fromthe military point of view, a natural corollary of the ogcu-pation of Yannina.     The occupation of Philippiada (alsoreported by the same authority on the same date) has nomeaning except as a step in an advance to the Gulf of Arta.Philippiada lying 35 miles due South of Yannina on the roadleading to the Gulf of Arta and Prevesa - the occupation ofwhich was reported on June&quot;9th, but subse^e^aly denied.     Itseems clear that an advance to the Gulf of Arta - dictatedby obviously political motives - has been planned and partlyexecuted, but was counter-ordered in consequence&apos;of the pro-tests of the Allied Governments. .The Italian Foreign Minister, satisfied with havingin a striking manner asserted Italyfs dignity and freedom ofaction, is prepared now to acquiesce in the interpretation ofItaly&apos;s action in Albania and Northern Epirus as merely &quot;amilitary episode&quot; which shall not be prejudicial to the even-tual settlement and international agreement of Balkan ques-tions.     This retirement is however not openly acknowledged
by the Italian Govejtaent.     The Italian public is allowed toinfer it from the publication by Stefan! of the repliesgiven to questions in the nouse of Commons by Lord RobertCecil.The official attitude of disinterestedness withregard to Greece is, as was pointed out last week, reflectedeven in the nationalist press which says in effect - &quot;Howthat our influence in the Balkans has been asserted andacquiesced in, and that our aspirations in Asia Minor - andin particular the possession of Smyrna - have been assured tous, we can afford to leave our Allies to settle as theyplease the now purely internal difficulties of Greece.   Ifthey are under the illusion that tho restoration of Venizelosto power will help them, that is not our fault.    Some daythey will have to own that we told them the truth.&quot;In spiifc of the assurance given in the ItalianForeign Minister1s reply to the Russian Note on War-Aims(&quot;All spirit of conquest or domination is excluded from..... .^ ..................... s ^ .      ...Italyfs policy&quot;), the Imperialist air given to Italy&apos;s recentstep has naturally aroused suspicion and resentment in Russia,and the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs has proposed ajoint protest and repudiation of Italy&apos;s action on the partof Russia, France and Groat Britain.     In consideration ofthe present precarious position of the Italian Government,the protest has been at least deferred.     If eventually made;it would almost certainly divide the two wings of the   &quot;inter-vcntionists&quot; - the War Party - in Italy.    The Nationalists -resentful of interference and jealous of ItalyTs dignity -would rally to the defence of the Ministry which they nowdepreciate, as too feeble in its war-policy;   the Democrats,having themselves protested, would stultify themselves utterlyif they did not go into opposition.     what the effect of This
division would be is pointed out in a later paragraph of thisReport.The Offer oontained in the reply of the BritishGovernment to the Kussian Hote to &quot;examine and if need berevise&quot; the agreements existing between the Allies, alreadyexcited alarm in the Nationalist press.News of the arrival at Port Said of an Italiancontingent destined for Palestine is greeted as proof of theEntente&apos;s decision to internationalise the Holy Land.     TheNationalist organ is particularly pleased, having upheld thispolicy in opposition to certain French journals, but asksresentfully why the Italian contingent is not equal in numbersand importance to that of the British.Internal Politics:The so-called Cabinet Crisis opened by the resigna-tion of the three Ministers belonging to the Extreme Left;BS^isolati, Bonomi and Comandini - and of Canepa, Under Secre-tary for Agriculture and Commissary of Pood Consumption, wasin its original form a protest against the methods and tem-perament of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.     Personal con-ferenceshaving apparently removed the objections and suspicionsof the protesting Ministers, the discussions shifted to theground of internal policy.    Attacks on Signor Orlando haveof late been increasing in virulence (see Allied Press Sup-plement, June 20, p. 154) and interventionists of all shades ..have been insisting on severer repression of neutralism.Here also,however, a compromise seems to have been accented,though nothing is known ce to its nature - probably a weedingout of Giolittean prefects was promised.     Finally the oppor-tuni*  was taken to strengthen the Ministry on its technicalside by certain changes which have been long clamoured for
by&apos;the ^interventionist&quot; press. As a result of these changesthe Italian.Ministry is now composed as follows:-President     ...     ...	BoselliForeign Affairs	SonninbHome Office ...     ...	OrlandoEducation     ...     ...	RuffiniJustice .     ...     ...	SacchiTransports   ......	Riccardo BianfihiPublic ?/orks ..     ...&quot;	BonomiTreasury      ......	CaijcanoMunitions     ......	DallolioColonies      ...     ...	ColosimoWar     ......     ...	GiardinoMarine	DrianziIndustry &amp; Commerce..	De Nova  .Posts &amp; Telegraphs...	FeraFinance .    ...	Me daAgriculture ......	RaineriMinisters without )     Arlotta, Bri^olatt, Leonardo,Portfolios:        ) Bianchi, Comandini &amp; Scialoja.It is further announced that King Victor Emmanuelhas accepted the resignations of General Alfieri, Under Secre-tary of State for War, and Signor Canepa, Under Secretary ofState for Agriculture, and has appointed General Montanari, .Under Secretary for Munitions and Signor Cermenats UnderSecretary for Agriculture.The solution satisfies neither wing of the V/ar-Party.    The Left (represented by the Secolo) reproaches theMinisters who provoked the crisis for having weakly allowedthemselves to be talked over instead of pushing their demands
to a logical conclusion - a radical renovation of the Ministryinvolving presumably the disappearance of bonnino and Orlando,The Nationalist organ scornfully calls the solution a &quot;rimpasto&quot;and finds fresh proof of the ineptitude of the Ministry in thevery changes designed to strengthen it.     ihese changes -the raising of Gen. Dallolio to the rank of Minister and theappointment of Mccardo Bianchi to be iiinister of Transports,ought to have been made six months ago when they were alreadydemanded.     The readiness shown by the Ministers of the Leftto accept a compromise is accounted for by their anxiety toavoid an extra-Porliamentary crisis.     This motive is ridi-culed by the Nationalist who holds that Parliament - and es-pecially the existing Parliament of Giolittl&amp;n origin - is a &apos;negligible quantity in time of war.    A National Governmentcomprising all parties and existing independently of parties,is what is required.     Its composition ought to be determinedpurely by the needs of the mx end not by any balancing ofParliamentary interests.     It is the &apos;*Group of national Action&apos;7,formed at the end of last session from &quot;interventionists&apos;7 ofall parties, that is looked to to realise these desires.Public opinion is with them and the;y are in a legal positionftto &quot;translate&apos;into concrete facts&quot; the demand for a real Var-Government and a real ^ar-Policy.     Obviously an attempt tooverthrow the Government on a vote of confidence is herethreatened.     The official announcement cf the changes madein the Ministry also seems to contemplate the possibility ofa General Cabinet Crisis bein- brought about by Parliaments rymeans Cohere being no question at present&quot;, is its len^uage,&quot;of a general crisis such as Parliament*alone can determine&quot;);but the dangers of a defeat of the Ministry are too great andtoo obvious to be neglected by either wing of the  .ar Party.
-6- 217A secret   union of parties in a National Ministry beinghardly possible, both Democrats and Imperialists know that anyserious division between them would mean either a Gfiolittanrestoration or some unconstitutional regime.    Nationalistsmight welcome the latter but neifhtor party would take therisk of a return of Giolitti to power.     The dnager is morepressing now than it was in June 1916, when Salandra fell.Since then war-weariness has had time to grow and the RussianRevolution has made neutralism respectable.Appendiees to the Cabinet Crisis are the formationof a Ministerial Committee of Reconstruction and the &quot;Consoli-dation&quot; of the Italian mission to the United States.J.C.P.
