Confidential.Printed for the TJse of the Reconstruction Committee.RECONSTRUCTION  COMMITTEE.Post-War Economic Problems.THE GERMAN MAJORITY SOCIALISTS AND THE PRINCIPLE OFNATIONALITY.It is well known that the German Majority Socialists have associated themselveswhole-heartedly with the militarist policy of riding rough-shod over the nationalaspirations of the populations of Eastern Europe ; hut in view of the confusion whichhas arisen as to the real meaning of the watchword &quot;No annexations and noindemnities,&quot; a fuller exposition of their point of view on the matter may be of interest.The following extract is translated from pp. 32-36 of a pamphlet entitled Partei-Zusammenhruch ? published in 1915 by Herr Cunow, one of the leading membersof the German Majority Socialist party. It is interesting for the unashamed ruth-lessness of its attitude towards small peoples, for the characteristically doctrinaireappeal to Marxian orthodoxy, and for the equally far-fetched attempt to explain thespread of the nationalist idea by considerations of material interest.&quot; The right to national independence was first proclaimed in the first half ofthe nineteenth century at the time when Europe was falling more and more into thegrip of capitalism. The members of small dependent nations, mostly still purelyagricultural in character, saw themselves hampered in their progress,&apos; and especiaRyin their efforts to attain a higher standard of life, by the nations which were moreprogressive and had already arrived at a more advanced economic stage. This wasmore particularly the case when the smaller nation was united with the larger in onestate and the greater and richer nation was in possession of the state power. Thesmaller agricultural nation received manufactured goods, cash payments, &amp;c, from itslarger and more progressive capitalist neighbour in return for its agricultural products.The native agricultural producers usually found that they were hampered by theirlanguage being little known outside their own borders, by their ignorance of foreigntrade usages, and by their general commercial inexperience. The result was that itwas mostly the representatives of the dominant nation who did the work of buyingand selling, shipping, commission business, &amp;c.&quot; Still worse was the position for the intellectuals. The lawyer had perhaps toplead in a strange language and to watch the chief judicial positions being occupiedby representatives of the dominant nation, while- his own road was blocked and hisclients were often badly treated by strange judges. The official and the teacherfound that representatives of the dominant nation took precedence of them inpromotion, that the spread of native speech was prejudiced by language edicts andtheir district neglected as regards the making of roads, bridges and railways. Thewriter found his range of activity narrowed and the market for the products of hispen limited because the circle to whom he wrote in his own language was in anycase but a small one and was too poor to buy his works in any quantity. In shortthe lesser nation saw itself everywhere exploited by its dominant neighbour and itsown vital interests neglected. Had it not an equal right to development,, to freeactivity, and to the use of its own forces ?&quot; Thus it was that the so-called national movement arose, first of all among theintellectuals, just as to-day in countries like Egypt, Persia and India, the supportersof so-called nationalism are still almost exclusively drawn from that class. But theintellectuals by themselves can do little. If they are to achieve any measure ofsuccess they must make their movement a movement of the whole people, and forthis purpose they must make popular democratic demands. That is to say, they mustgive their movement, even if it is at bottom reactionary,, a democratic. and perhapseven a semi-socialist form.     . aA   (33)1339-51   125   5/17   E &amp; S &apos;2
2&quot; It is in these middle-class democratic and pseudo-democratic circles that theright of nations to state independence arose, thence, like many pieces of middle-classideology, to be embodied in the theory of German social democracy.But some of my comrades will ask : &apos; Why should we not take our ideas fromthe middle-class nationalist democracy ?&apos; My reply is, first, because this so-called- right&apos; is not in harmony with historical development. If we look elsewhere than atthe&quot; limited region of south-east Europe, and at any other time than during the lastdecades, historical development knows nothing of a process of national differentiation,but only of a great process of amalgamation, of a continuous fusing of small nation-alities into great culture states. Secondly, because the legal demand in question, inthe universalised form in which it comes before us, i.e., as the right of every people,whatever its character and circumstances, is thoroughly reactionary, for it means thatnations which are not capable of life, which are more or less devoid either of a historyor a culture, have a right to national independence, even when this independence willnot tend to&apos; promote a wider cultural development, but must in fact operate as ahindrance to it. .&quot; It is for this reason that Marx never recognised this so-called national rightbut condemned it as reactionary.&quot; When in the years 1847-48 the Slav peoples of southern Europe demandednational independence, and the so-called &apos; democratic pan-Slavist movement,&apos; by thepen of Michael Bakunin, issued a call to the Slavs with the usual appeals to justice,freedom, humanity, &amp;c, Marx wrote as follows in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (14thFebruary 1849):-&apos; Justice, humanity, freedom, equality, brotherhood, independence-hitherto we have found nothing more in the pan-Slavist manifesto than thesemore or less moral categories ; they sound very pretty, but in connection withhistorical and political questions they are meaningless. Justice, humanity,freedom, &amp;c, may demand this or that a thousand times; but, if what theydemand is an impossibility it does not happen, and remains in spite of all anempty dream.&apos; Just one word about this &quot; universal brotherhood of nations &quot; and the&quot;drawing of boundaries delimited by-the sovereign will of the peoples thein-&quot; selves on the basis of their individuality.&quot; The United States and Mexicoare two republics. In both the people are sovereign. How comes it thatbetween these two republics, which, according to the moral theory, ought to be&quot;fraternal&quot; and &quot;federated,&quot; came to blows over Texas? How comes it thatthe &quot; sovereign will&quot; of the American people,- exemplified in the courage ofthe American volunteers, pushed the boundary drawn by nature one hundredmiles further to the south to meet &quot; geographical, commercial and strategicnecessities ? &quot; And will Bakunin blame the Americans for a war of conquestwhich, though a severe blow to his theory and its basis of justice andhumanity, was conducted solely and purely in the interests of civilisation?Or shall we call it a misfortune that the beautiful land of California has beentorn from the Mexicans, who did not know what use to make of it ? Is it amisfortune that the energetic Yankees, by the rapid exploitation of the goldmines, will increase the world&apos;s medium of exchange, that on the mostconvenient portion of the Pacific they will within a few years concentrate adense population and an extensive trade, build great cities, open steamshipcommunications, make a railway from Newr York to San Francisco, throw openthe Pacific Ocean for the first time. in civilisation, and for the third time inhuman history give a new direction to the commerce of the world ? Theindependence of a few Spanish Californians and Texans may be impaired by it,justice and other moral principles may here and there suffer injury, but whatis that against developments of such world-wide importance ? &apos;&quot; Again in an article about pan-Slavist movements in Hungary, Marx writes : &apos; There is not a country in Europe which does not possess in some corneror another one or a number of ruins of peoples, survivals of earlier inhabitantspushed back and subjugated by the nation which later entered upon theinheritance of historical development. These remains of nations mercilesslytrodden under foot, as Hegel puts it, by the progress of history, these leavingsof peoples are and always will be until their final extinction or denationalisa-tion fanatical adherents of the counter revolution ; for their whole existence isin itself a protest against a great- historical revolution.   Thus in Scotland the
Gaels were supporters of the Stuarts from 1640 to 1^45 ; in France the Bretonssupported the Bourbons from 1792 to 1800; in Spain the Basques supportedDon Carlos; in Austria we have pan-Slavist southern Slavs who are nothingmore than the remains of a very confused development extending over athousand years. It is the most natural thing in the world that this mostconfused little remnant should see its salvation in the reversal of the wholeEuropean movement, which, if it had its way would proceed from east to westrather than from west to east, and that its harsh instrument of liberation, its*  bond of unity, should be the Russian knout.&apos;&quot; Thus it was that Marx rejected all national movements directed to state inde-pendence. Where independence or national unity was the prerequisite for a highercultural development, where it set free a trammelled force of development, both Marxand Engels, careless of many inconvenient surrounding circumstances, were in favourof the promotion of national unity. For that reason both of them were desirous in1870 that Germany should be victorious in spite of Bismarkism, for the restoration ofGermany&apos;s national existence seemed to them the first step towards the highereeonomic development of Germany and the political progress of the German socialdemocratic working-class movement. Thus for instance in a letter to Marx, Engelswrites on 15th August 1870 : &apos; I look upon the matter in this light. Germany has been driven byBadinguet - (Napoleon) into a war for her national existence. If she isbeaten, Buonapartism is strengthened for years to come, and Germany isruined for years, perhaps for generations.. It would be no good talking of anindependent German working-class movement. The fight for the restorationof the national existence would occupy all minds, and at the best the Germanworking man would follow in the wake of the French. If Germany loses,Buonapartism is certainly finished for good. Once the eternal fuss about therestoration of German unity is cleared out of the way, the German working-man will be able to organise on quite a different national scale, and the French,whatever government they have, will have a far fuller scope than underBuonapartism. The mass of the German people of all classes has recognisedthat it is primarily a question of their national existence, and has thereforeitself sprung to arms. That a German political party under these circum-stances should preach total obstruction in Liebknecht&apos;s fashion and put allsorts of minor considerations before the main question, seems to meimpossible.&apos;&quot; Marx even justified in certain circumstances the compulsory annexation orincorporation o*f &apos; infirm &apos; little nations into the domain of the great culture nations.In the article already referred to, where he deals with democratic pan-Slavism, hewrites: &apos; Finally what a &quot; crime,&quot; what a &quot; damnable policy,&quot; that at the momentwhen great monarchies were becoming &quot; an historical necessity &quot; for Europe ingeneral, the Germans and Magyars welded togther all these infirm helpless littlenations and thus enabled them to take part in a historical development fromwhich, had they kept by themselves, they would have remained entirely aloof.True, such a chance cannot be brought about Avithout many a gentle nationalflower being violently trodden under foot; but without violence, without alliron ruthlessness, nothing can be carried through in history. Had Alexander,Cassar, and Napoleon indulged in the same tender feelings to which pan-Slaviststo-day appeal for the sake of their miserable clients, what would have happenedto human history ? &apos;&quot; That is the Marxian point of view. Let anyone who wishes compare it withthe defence of the right of every nation to national independence, which is advocatedin a great part of our press, and then ask himself : &apos; What right have the authors ofsuch articles to appeal to the authority of Marx ? &apos; &quot;
