282Intelligence Bureau,epartment of Information.CRT/01QWEEKLY REPORT Ok RUSSIA. X.June 25, 1917.Ifhe Congress of the C.Yi,S.D.The All-Russia Congress of the C .k .S.D. has already done muchto clear the air in Petrcgrad.    It is the nearest approach to a!parliament that is possible until the Constituent Assembly meets,and Its actions so far have shown that it realises its properfunctions.   The resolutions passed by this body read very differentlyfrom the numerous excited resolutions passed by the PetrogradC.W.S.D. in the early days of the Revolution,   The resolutionsof that body were often contradictory aid apparently dependedvery largely on the mood of those present or the success of the lastirresponsible speaker in carrying the audience with him.   In spiteof the moderation of the leaders the Petrograd body often got outof hand and even adopted a hostile attitude to the CoalitionGovernment on some occasions.   The All-Russia Congress, however,has decided to give the Coalition Government its full support andthe Government is already showing a welcome firmness in dealingwith the Extremists.     The expulsion of Grimm, the Swiss Socialist,and the t&amp;timatum sent to the Leninites who occupied Durnovo^ housein Petrograd are signs that the Government is finding its positionvery much more secure.The most important point, however, is the fact that the Con-gress has given its approval to the idea of an offensive.    If thisreport is correct it shows a very marked improvement, as thePetrograd C.W.S.D. has never expressed itself in such clear language.It would appear that Mr Kerenskifs tour has begun to bear fruit
and that the feeling in the provinces  s in favour of his policyof a strong army that will fight in defence of the ideas of theRevolution.   Once an offensive is launched there is every hopeof the Germans taking a false step in their propaganda in Russia.At present they are putting all their cards on the Extreme SocialDemocratst whose psychology they understand, as these men havelearnt their Socialism in Germany, but it is far less likely thatthey will interpret aright the psychology of the Russian peopleas a whole or of the purely Russian Socialists of the type ofKerenski, and it is by no means impossible that by some act offrightfulness on the Russian front they may complete the work thatMr- Kerenski and General Brusilov have begun.Political Parties and the War.As political parties in Russia are, generally speaking, inrather a fluid state at present it is worth while reviewing fromtime to time their attitude towards the war.   Since the Rovolutionno Monarchist party has dared to lift its head, and it is probablethat the &quot;bulk of the Monarchists will find it advisable to groupthemselves round Hr Guchkov, who is forming a new OctobristRepublican Party.   Slightly to &quot;the Left of I.;r Guchkov standMr Milyukov and the Cadets, who, in spite of their &quot;imperialism&quot;,are more liberal in internal politics,   At the present momentthe vast majority of the bourgeoisie belong to one of these twoparties, and they may all be said to favour the continuation ofthe war to victory.It is among the Socialist parties that the attitude towardsthe war is changing.   At a time of crisis like the presentit has become necessary for Russian Socialists to decide whetherthey are Russians first and Socialists afterwards or vice versa.It may safely be said that the bulk of the Social Revolutionary
party belongs to the former category.   This party Includes thesomewhat vague Socialists of the type of Messrs Vodovozov, .Bramsonand Berezin, who group themselves round the paper Dyen, the PopulistSocialists represented in the Government by Mr Pyeshekhonov, andthe strict Social Revolutionaries.   The latter were at one timelargely terrorists, but since the Revolution have completelychanged their methods and are now probably the largest Socialistparty in Russia.   They have lately been dividing into two wings -that led by Mr Kerenski which is throwing itself heart and soul intothe war as a war of defence, and that lod by Mr Chernov which cannotshake off its internationalism and is still undecided about anoffensive.The same process has, though to a less extent, been takingplace among the Social Democrats, though the majority amongst thelatter are strong Internationalists.   The extreme Right ?/ing ledby Mr Plekhanov has few ad-herents, but slightly to tho Left ofhim Mr Tseretelli is rallying a large number of the MinimalistSocial Democrats round the motto of &quot;a war of defence&quot;.   TheMinimalists as a whole are much more numerous than the more noisyMaximalists who are definitely opposed to the war,   It will beinteresting to watch how their attitude to the war develops whenonce an offensive has been launched.The. Constituent Assembly.One of the accusations made against the first ProvisionalGovernment was its slowness in making preparations for thoConstituent Assembly.   The first Committee that was set up under thepresidency of Mr Kokoshkin, a well-known Cadet, set to work asearly as April 4, and about a fortnight later sent invitations to22 organisations and parties to send representatives.     Unfortunatelythe 22 organisations were very slow in sending representatives,especially the Petrograd C.W.S.D.     At a meeting of the Cadet party
jft. ftekrasov laid the blame for the delay both on the Government andthe CW.S.D.     The real cause of the delay seems to have been thebad relations between the Government and the C.W.S.D., but now thatthe Coalition Government has been formed the C.W.S.D. are sending theirrepresentatives without further delay.   The number of representativesseems to be stead^ily increasing and the Committee will probablynumber about 100.   Such large numbers may delay the carrying out ofthe very technical work the Committee is charged with and evenaccording to the most hopeful estimate the work of the Committeewill not be   concluded until tho middle of July.   Mr Kerenski recentlyannounced that the Constituent Assembly would meet by November,but this will, of course, depend upon the course of events in Russia.There is little doubt that delay in calling the ConstituentAssembly plays into the hands of the Extremists, who refuse towait until the wishes of the people can be legally expressed andrecommend the immediate seizure of the land.   The answer of theModerates to the propaganda of the Extremists has always been thatnone of these vital questions can be settled until the ConstituentAssembly meets.   It may be observed that, as it is in the interests ofthe Moderates that the Assembly should meet as soon as possible, itIs not unlikely that should the elections be delayed by militarynecessities they (the Moderates) may become less and less enthusiasticabout the   continuation of the war.   This is   a danger that cannotbe ignored.The Economic Crisis.The outward and visible sign of the economic crisis was pro-vided by the resignation of Mr Konovalov, Minister of Commerce.Though a strong Liberal in politics he is at the same time a richmerchant and in the eyes of the Socialists is a typical representativeof the hated bourgeoisie.   The immediate cause of his resignation
lS the appointment of Mr Skobelev, the Socialist Minister ofibour, who lost no time in announcing a programme that gravelypfected the interests of the industrialists.   Mr Skobelev&apos;siasures may be summed up under the following heads:-(1) Large increase of excess profits tax.(2) Increased income tax for large incomes.(3) State monopoly of fuel and other raw stuffs.The most serious dispute between employers and employeesis brokylm out in the coal mines of the Donets Basin.   The work-in have demanded much higher pay, amounting to an increase ofi.   The employers express their readiness to give up their&apos;ofits, but maintain that the present demands of the workmeniuld be absolutely ruinous to Russian industry.   To this   theirkmen reply that their wants can easily be satisfied out of thewious profits made by the employers during the war.   No onemies that during the war many bankers and manufacturers haveide enormous profits;   for example, in the State and Commercialinks deposits have increased during the war by 5,095,000,000lubles.   These increased deposits come chiefly from theidustrialists and are no doubt the result of war profits.   At them time, it is only fair to mention that there has been a greatiQrease in the   deposits in the Savings Banks, which represent theivings of the lower classes.   It is for this reason that theidustrialists object to what they consider the one-sided measuresf the Socialists, who intend to let the whole weight of taxationdl on them.The disputes between employers and employees are not confined)the South of Russia;   the same -exorbitant demands have beende by the workmen almost everywhere.   As a result a largeunber of factories have had to close down and those workmen who&apos;e thus thrown out of work are a serious menace to the public
ifety.   Economic disorganisation at the present moment would meaniat after the. war Russia would have little chance of beingdependent- economically.   This is an argument that has beenequently used by the employers.R.A.L;.25.6.17.
