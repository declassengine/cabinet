Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET. G.-143.REDISTILLATION OF POTABLE SPIRITS FOR MUNITIONS, &amp;c.Memorandum by the Hon. Waldorf . Astor, M.P.THE munition, and industrial requirements of alcohol are now about 3,000,000 gallons of proof spirit per month.This alcohol can be made by using either grain, molasses, West Indian spirit, or potable spirit.   The last named is in this country ; the other three have to be imported.. At present grain to the amount of 23,635 tons per month is lised, which produces 2,622,800 gallons of spirit and some 2,800 tons of yeast. This latter approximately represents the total amount now used &quot;by bakers.Some grain must still be used to produce yeast, but it is probable that the bakers could, if required, use less yea.it, and so effect a saving in grain.The Food (War) Committee of the Royal Society are of opinion that the consumption of distillers&apos; yeast could, without great difficulty or hardship, be reduced to 50 per cent. ,The Food Controller stated recently that the information then available seeined to indicate that about 50 per cent, would prove ample, and that possibly this could be still further cut down.Sir Frederic Nathan, on the other hand, does not believe a reduction is possible.If British brewers&apos; yeast or imported American yeast or baking powder were used for baking, a, further economy might be, made, or these substitutes could be used to supplement the reduced amount of distillers&apos; yeast and to meet possible contingencies. The Food Controller is investigating the matter further.The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies are also looking into the matter. The Vice-Chairman has written as follows : &quot; These investigations (i.e., into the possible economy in distillers&apos; yeast) will necessarily take several weeks, but the necessitjr for conserving grain supplies is so pressing and obvious that the Commission have no hesitation in urging that concurrently with the investigations steps should be taken without delay to commence the conversion of potable spirit in bond to industrial alcohol; the spirit which has been most recently distilled would be converted in preference to the more mature, and the loss of interest, &amp;c, would be correspondingly reduced. The Commission are aware that the use of matured spirit for munition or industrial purposes must necessarily involve financial loss. They urge, however, that this financial difficulty is on a different plane from the difficulty of transport or the necessity for maintaining adequate supply of cereal food in this country. They suggest that if a choice is to be made between going short of essential food or sacrificing some supplies of matured spirit, there can be no question as to the answer.&quot;If the consunrption of yeast by bakers were halved, a monthly saving of 11,800 tons of grain would be effected. The spirit made by using grain would still amount to about 1,300,000 gallons.This lea ves a balance of 1,700,000 gallons per month to be made from some other raw material. If molasses were used, 15,400 tons would have to be imported. If West Indian spirits were used the imports would be 7,000 tons. The molasses would be brought in tank steamers, which are suitable for petrol, lubricating oil, &amp;c. The spirit would be conveyed in casks, and would have to be redistilled in this country. [473]
The above tonnage could, however, be saved if the munition or industrial alcohol were obtained by redistilling potable spirit. This can be done, but Sir Frederic Nathan rightly points out that the consequences would be serious. They would be as follows: 1. Damage to an important national industry. 2. Political agitation, particularly in Ireland.3. Panic and financial crisis (banks often make advances to merchants bydiscounting bills or giving loans on the security of stocks). 4. Cost,On this question of price the Ministry of Munitions have powers to acquire goods and pay on the following basis : (a.) If the goods are acquired from the grower or producer thereof, to the cost of production and to the rate of profit usually earned by him in respect of similar goods before the war, and to whether any such rate of profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circumstances of the case.(b.) If the goods are acquired from any person other than the grower or producer thereof, to the price paid by such person for the goods and to whether such price was unreasonable or excessive, and to the rate of profit usually earned in respect of the sale of similar goods before the war, and to whether such rate or profit was unreasonable or excessive, and to any other circum-stances of the case ; so, however, that if the person from whom the goods are acquired himself acquired the goods otherwise and in the usual course of his business, no allowance, or an allowance at a reduced rate, on account of profit shall be made.Although the cost of producing the whisky before the war was only 3s. per gallon, there have been considerable sales at varying and rising prices. - These prices, however, are probably lower than the latest quoted market price of 20s., which may represent comparatively small transactions.The Government should protect themselves against further increase in prices by either purchasing the stocks or by fixing prices at which the whisky of different ages, &amp;c, could be taken over as required.The Ministry of Shipping have been consulted. Sir Joseph Maclay and the Shipping Control Committee state that, in view of the great saving of tonnage that would result if the spirit in stock in this country could be redistilled in connection with the manufacture of explosives, they strongly urge that the matter receive the favourable consideration of His Majesty s Government.W.
