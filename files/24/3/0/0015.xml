The glycerine should, if possible, be Nobel test.Aluminium.Italian factories not being yet in full work, and as it cannot be anticipated that they will be completely ready before May, so it is necessary for Italy to receive during the first four months a minimum of 600 tons from January on.102 Shells. ;54,500 in billets of multiple lengths.The English ammunition Department of War thinks to be able to supply monthly from 4 to 5,000 tons of steel for heads.
Vickers&apos; Machine Guns. 400 machine guns.The shipping of the first 200 machine guns, Vickers type, has been delayed on account of big demand from the British Army; ,200 would be shipped in a very, short time, but they are ground type. It is agreed that two arranged to be mounted on aeroplanes will be sent immediately, and Mr.-Layton, as soon as he will be back to England, will cable information about the time wanted to transform the 200 machine guns, ground type, for aeroplane mounting.
