SECRET.G.-126.DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR BOARD, AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE ADMIRALTY, WAR OFFICE, AND MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS.(Letter prom Secretary, Air Board, to Secretary, War Cabinet, together with a Memorandum by the Air Board, dated February 1, 1917.)A.B. 81/11.Sir, Air Board Office, Strand, W.G., February 1, 1917.I AM directed by the President of the Air Board to refer to Sections 7 and 8 of the New Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1916, and to the proceedings of the War Cabinet of the 22nd December, 1916,*&quot; when the Cabinet determined in outline the duties and functions of the Air Board and its relations with the Admiralty, War Office, and Ministry of Munitions. The Cabinet decided that the details of the new arrangement should be worked out in consultation between these Departments.I am now to forward, for the approval of the War Cabinet, a Memorandum embodying the conclusions which have been arrived at by the four Departments as a result of discussion of the subject.It will be observed that the Memorandum embodies the material portions of the resolution of the War Committee of the 11th May, 1916, and of the draft conclusions of the War Committee of the 27th November, which were approved by the War Cabinet on the 22nd December, 1916, with two substantial alterations, apart from some slight modifications of wording.   The two alterations are the following: In the first place, the decision of the Cabinet to entrust the design as well as the supply of aircraft to the Ministry of Munitions was found to give rise to certain difficulties. That Department, constituted primarily as a manufacturing or supply department, did not consider itself well adapted to dealing with the highly specialised duty of selecting and approving the designs of aircraft. The science of aeronautics is at present in a state of such rapid and constant growth that it appeared expedient that its application to questions of design should be in the hands of a body on which the Naval and Military Flying Services were directly represented, and an agreement was arrived at accordingly that the Air Board should be charged with this duty. The accommodation in close proximity under one roof in the new premises of the Air Board&apos; of the Departments dealing with Design and Supply respectively will secure their complete co-ordination.In the second place, it was agreed by all concerned that better results would be obtained if the distinction made in the records of the proceedings of the War Cabinet of the 22nd December, 1916, between the treatment of aeroplanes and seaplanes, by which the former were to be designed and supplied by the Ministry of Munitions and the latter by the Admiralty, were not insisted upon. Aeroplanes and seaplanes are manufactured by the same firms, are built out of the same raw materials, and present ni points of design, in a large measure, the same problems. In these circumstances it is proposed that the design and supply of seaplanes should be dealt with in the same manner as the design and supply of aeroplanes.I am to express the hope that the War Cabinet may see fit to approve the Memorandum, which has been drawn up on this basis.* Note by the Secretary to the War Cabinet.-See War Cabinet 15. Minute 9. [244-7]Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1917.
It will be-seen that-the Memorandum restricts-the province of the Air Board to questions of naval and military aeronautics. The conclusion of peace will bring with it urgent problems of another order.The rapid development of aeronautics during the war will give an immediate impetus to commercial aviation, the development and regulation of which both from a domestic, an Imperial, and an international standpoint, will present problems which will need consideration by a body familiar with the technical conditions which those problems involve.Apart from this, the disposal of large quantities of costly aeronautical material, which may be surplus to peace requirements and will deteriorate rapidly, will have to be considered. The needs of the Dominions and the requirements of commercial aviation may present the means of disposing in part of this material.The Air Board is of opinion that it would be in the public interest that it should be given power to consider and discuss these questions in good time with departmental and other assistance as may prove necessary. Their consideration should not he unduly hurried, while the correspondence involved, e.g., with the Dominions, may occupy a considerable period.I am accordingly to suggest that the Cabinet should add a paragraph to the enclosed Memorandum to the following effect:- &quot; The Air Board will have power to consider the problems connected with the development and regulation of aviation for civil and commercial purposes and to; make recommendations to the Departments concerned.&quot;I am further to suggest that, in view of the public interest taken in the new arrangements to be adopted in connection with the Air Services, it would be desirable that the enclosed Memorandum, if approved by the Cabinet, should be published, and Lam to ask the authority of the Cabinet for doing so.I am, &amp;c.H. P. HARVEY.The Secretary,War Cabinet,10, Downing Street, S.W.Enclosure.Memorandum by the Air- Board.1. The Board will be composed&apos;of  The President,The Parliamentary Secretary,The -Fifth Sea Lord of the Admiralty,The Director-General of Military Aeronautics,Two Representatives of the Ministry of Munitions,Additional Members, as may from time to time be found desirable.The naval and military representatives shall each be authorised to bring to meetings of the Board an assistant if and when they think fit. In case of the absence of the Pifth Sea Lord or the Director-General of Military Aeronautics, an officer will be deputed to represent the Admiralty or War Office.2. The Board shall be free to discuss matters of policy in relation to the air, and to make recominedations to the Admiralty and War Office thereon.3: The Admiralty and War Office will concert their respective aerial policies in consultation with the Air Board.4. The Admiralty and War Office will formulate the programmes of aerial production required for the fulfilment of the approved policy, and will refer these programmes for the consideration and concurrence of the Air Board.5. The Air Board will decide as to the extent to which it is possible to approve the departmental programmes, having regard to the possible rate of production, the needs of the other Department, the respective urgency of the demands, and the supplies agreed to be adven to Allied Governments.
6. The Air Board will select and he responsible for the designs of aeroplanes and:, seaplanes, with their engines and accessories, which are to be constracted for the purposes of the approved programme and for experimental purposes.7. For the purpose of carrying out its duties in connection with design a Technical Committee will be constituted under the Air Board as follows: Chairman, to be appointed by the President of the Air Board.Two representatives appointed by the Admiralty.Two representatives appointed by the War Office.Two representatives appointed by the Ministry of Munitions.Three other members possessed of special qualifications may be appointed by the President; at least one of them shall have present day manufacturing experience.&apos;The officers selected to represent the above Departments of the Government may he assisted or replaced by other representatives as may be found convenient.The representatives of either of the three Departments may appeal to the Air Board in the event of their disagreeing with a decision of the majority of the Committee.8. One of the members of the Technical Committee will be the Executive Director of the Technical Department of the Air Board.9. An Inventions Committee will be appointed by the President of the Air Board, in which will be amalgamated the functions of the Aeronautical Sections of the Naval Board of Invention and Research and of the Munitions Inventions Department.10. Experiments for the Naval and Military Air Services will be conducted for those Services through the Technical Committee. Eor this purpose, Naval and Military Air Service experimental stations will, while remaining under the Admiralty and War Office for administration, pay, and discipline, be placed at the disposal of the Technical Committee, which will issue its instructions through the Service members of the Air Board. The experimental stations in question are the following (to he agreed upon from time to time).-11. The Royal Aircraft Factory will be placed under the Ministry of Munitions, and the designs prepared at the Factory will be dealt with in the same way as those submitted by a contractor. It is understood that the Ministry of Munitions will permit the facilities of the Factory to be utilised largely for the purpose of conducting the experiments which are desired by the Technical Committee.12. The Air Board will furnish approved plans and specifications to the Aircraft Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions.13. No modifications of design, other than trivial alterations within the discretion of a superintending inspector, will be made without the concurrence of the Air Board.14 The numbers and designs of the aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessories respectively to be ordered, having been determined by the Air Board, will be notified to the Director of Munitions Requirements and Statistics through the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies of the Ministry of Munitions, who will be responsible for their production, in conformity with the approved designs, and who alone is authorised to give instructions to manufacturers.15. Inspection during manufacture will be carried out by the Ministry of Munitions.16. All reasonable facilities will be afforded to expert officers of the Air Board and of the Services to have access to manufacturers&apos; works.17. The Ministry of Munitions will hand over to the Air Service for which they are destined, for trial and acceptance, the aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessories, when manufactured, at the manufacturers&apos; works.18. For the purpose of giving effect to the above organisation, the officers and staff at present engaged under the Admiralty and the War Office on the duties of design and supply of aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessories and on the Board of Invention and Research will, so far as may be required and possible, be lent for services with the Air Board, or the Ministry of Munitions.19. Any of the Departments represented on the Air Board, and the Air Board itself, will have the right of appeal to the War Cabinet in case of dispute.
