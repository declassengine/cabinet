Printed for the War Cabinet,   February 19lV.SECRET. 0.-116.iRESTRICTION   OF  BREWING.? Memorandum by Lord D&apos;Abernon.. (Previous Papers Nos. G.-107 and G.-115.)THE proposal to curtail the amount of grain available for brewing by 50 per cent, ig Apen to the following objections :  f     It curtails supply without reducing demand.   This will lead to trouble.It will cost the Treasury some 16,000,000Z. \ &apos; Its effect on drinking and drunkenness is quite uncertain ; it may not improbably result in alternations of beer famine and beer orgy, the public rushing for beer when it is available, and being discontented when the permitted supply is exhausted. Under the Restriction of Output Act this danger is only averted by brewers charging very high prices and making very large profits.But beer cannot be taken alone. Complementary measures are requisite for spirits, otherwise the public, deprived of beer, will merely be diverted from beer to spirits. If the complementary measures are effective, the total loss to the Treasury will be raised from 15,000,0001. to 24,000,000Z. (exclusive of possible claims for compensation). The necessary steps for spirits are difficult to devise. The Excise consider Mr. Stevenson s scheme unworkable, and any allocation of the reduced supply, either to the wholesale or retail trade, presents grave difficulties of execution, similar in character to, but graver than, those indicated in the case of beer.; The proposal cuts into the policy of gradual dilution, which has already achieved great results, and is working practically without friction. Beer is already coming down in strength under the Restriction of Output Act, and spirits have been reduced from 2Q under proof to below 30 under proof, without serious protest.i    These objections could be met if the following alternative measures were adopted :-IVlodify the existing Restrictions of Output Act, reducing consumption to 15 percent, below the current financial year.   No greater reduction can wisely be imposedupon supply at one stroke unless demand has been reduced simultaneously.This diminished demand could be obtained by doubling the present duty on beer,spirits, and (?) wine.i  . The financial result of these measures may be estimated as follows : Doubling Present Duty on Beer and Spirits. Present revenue (1916-17) Under double taxAllow for reduction of 40 per cent, in consumption owing to combined effect of 15 per cent, further restriction of output and doubled taxTotal revenueAs compared with revenue under proposal to restrict brewing materials by 50 per cent, and spirits in corresponding degreeGain to revenue ...As a partial set-off to the large increase of taxation it would be well to abolish the present licence tax on beer-houses and publicans, as this tax hampers the development of public-houses on non-alcoholic and restaurant lines.The abolishing of the licenee duty would costNett gain as compared with Lord Devonport&apos;s proposal Nett gain compared with present revenue    ... 48,000,000 96,000,000 38,000,00058,000,00024,000,000 34,000,0004,000,000 30,000,0006,000,000
Effect on Administration and Public Order.As reduced consumption would proceed from increased duty and not from curtail-ment of supplies, the effect would not be spasmodic ; no trouble or difficulty would be experienced through intermittent supply. At present brewers have to charge excessive prices, thereby making an extravagant profit, in order to reduce consumption to the level of permitted supply. This constitutes a corner in beer for the benefit of the brewer.   The only (or the best) way to meet the difficulty is by an increase of tax.The advantages obtained under this plan would be permanent or quasi-permanent, whereas curtailment of supply could only be temporary.If the reduction of consumption attained under doubled taxation was less than 40 per cent., which is the Excise estimate, the benefit in grain saved would be less, but the financial benefit greater.On the question whether increased taxation is justified, it may be pointed out that the liquor trade has been deliberately left out of the general increase of taxation since November 1914, mainly because it was held that, being placed under the Central Control Board and its restrictions, it had suffered enough, but the action of the Central Control Board, so far from being detrimental to the financial interests of the trade, has been beneficial. Although the amount of alcohol sold has been largely diminished, both in beer and spirits, the net profit of a large number of brewers, particularly those in urban districts, has improved. This has been produced by the more reasonable conditions of trade imposed, including : (a.) The prohibition of credit and suppression of hawking. (b.) The prohibition of Jong-pull, (c.) The dilution of beer. (d.) The dilution of spirits.(e.) Shorter hours, enabling houses to be run on one shift instead of two, and;reducing charges for fire, light, and wear and tear. (/.) Improvement of type of public-house servants owing to reduced hours ofworking 5^ hours instead of 17.The ratio of net profit to turnover has, by these means, been largely increased. In effect some of the improvements anticipated from State control have already accrued.   They would be carried much further by unified control.This increased profit ought to revert to the State either by increased taxation or direct ownership as State action has been the main cause, apart from general prosperity.These considerations may be held to justify the increase of taxation suggested, while the necessity of reducing demand to conform to the restricted supply can be met in no other way so effectively and easily.Increased taxation is desirable, not so much because it produces revenue, as-because it is necessary to reduce consumption to the required level. It is justified by the fa^t that, although the amount of alcohol consumed has been largely diminished, trade profits have never been higher than to-day.D&apos;ABERNON.Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic), January 19, 1917.printed at the foreign office by c. r. harbison.-3/2/1917.
