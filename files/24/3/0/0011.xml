[This Bmmnent is the Bspperty of His BottomssPrinted for the War Cabinet   January 1917.SECRET.G.-111.3&apos;4RAILWAY COMMUNICATION THROUGH ITALY TO THE BALKANS.AT the Prime Ministers request, I telegraphed immediately after he had left&quot;. Rome to Sir Eric Geddes, asking him to send an expert to Italy to discuss with the Italian Minister of Transport the possibility of securing a shorter and safer route for troops and supplies going to the Balkans, by making greater use of the Italian railways to Taranto or Brindisi. I pressed the importance of this point very strongly in speaking to Baron Sonnino, and also especially in an interview which Mr. Royden and I had on the afternoon of Monday, the 8th January, with the Italian Minister of Transport and his Under-Secretary.They all fully admitted that, if the thing could be done, Italy had a very direct interest in it, as it meant a saving of shipping, and therefore more tonnage available for Italy, which, as we know, is in continual difficulties about the importation of coal and steel, and is now getting very anxious as all the Italian Ministers whom I met repeatedly-impressed upon me about the importation of grain. A shortage of wheat imports after the next two or three months is what they are most afraid of. The Italians, they affirm, will stand almost any hardships arising out of the war, including shortage of many articles of food, but not of bread.This question of transport to the Balkans has of course another side to it. In any case it would be an advantage if drafts, and also, if possible, stores, could be shipped to-Salonica from Brindisi or Taranto instead of from England. But the saving in tonnage and reduction in risk would be much greater if the subsequent sea journey could be reduced by disembarking at Itea or Santi Quaranta instead of &quot;going all the way round to Salonica. Santi Quaranta is the ideal route, as the sea passage thither is extremely short and can easily be guarded. On the other hand, the land-communication from Santi Quaranta to Monastir is extremely difficult, a long road through mountainous country, which, for part of the distance at least, is in a very bad-state. It is admitted on all hands that for immediate purposes the Santi Quaranta route cannot be thought of; but looking a little further ahead, it might be of the very greatest importance hereafter, if it could be made available for wheeled transport, with perhaps a Hecauville.The Italians are quite alive to this, and I gather from General Wilson that General Cadorna is going to do whatever he can in the way of preparing and opening this route as far as such operations can be guarded by the limited number of troops which he at present has at his disposal in that region (I gather that Italian troops have lately been withdrawn from Albania, and that instead of having something like 60,000 men there, as stated in our latest military returns, there are now only something like 30,000).With regard to this question Baron Sonnino made a significant remark to me. He said that, while it was perfectly impossible for the Italians to contemplate sending more troops to the Balkans at present, owing to the danger threatening their northern front (i.e., they fear a repetition of last year&apos;s attack in the Trentino by Austrians and Germans), he did not by any means exclude the possibility of Italy at&quot; a later stage, if the aforesaid danger had been overcome, considerably strengthening her army in the Balkans. In that case of course the Santi Quaranta route, if it could by any means be made practicable, would be of the greatest value.Note by Lord Milner.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
