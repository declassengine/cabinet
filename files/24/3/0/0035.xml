[This Document is the Property of His Brit&amp;nmc Majesty^ Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1917.SECRET.G.-130.CONFIDENTIAL NOTE ON ALLIED CONFERENCE AT PETROGRAD,JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1917. 1I DESIRE to put into the shape of a very confidential memorandum some reflections which appear to me deserving of serious consideration, if the labours of the present Conference are to result, as we all hope they must do, in a great strengthening of the military effort of the Allies.What can be said in these pages could not possibly be said at the plenary meetings of the Conference. It is not a matter suitable for minutes or protocols or official records of any kind, but it is something which ought to be in the minds of those who have any share in the supreme direction and conduct of the war. It is only addressed to these persons, and I feel sure that they will accept it in the spirit in which it is offered, as a contribution of my own, made on my sole responsibility, towards the attainment of a perfect under-standing for the co-ordination of all the efforts of the Allies. I shall therefore speak with absolute frankness, as great frankness as I should make use of in speaking to my own colleagues in the British Cabinet, and with as complete a confidence that anything I say, whether it is right or wrong, will at any rate be taken in good part.The way I look at it is this. We are face to face with a supreme emergency; we are all absolutely in one boat and have got to sink or swim together. There can be no thought of the individual interests of the Allied nations they have all one supreme interest, victory. There is, therefore, no room here for diplomatic refinements or subtleties or reserves, or for seeking to get the better of one another. We might try to think of ourselves, for the present purpose, as members of one Government pursuing one policy.   The only question i*, how it can most efficiently be carried out.It is from this point of view that I approach the subject. The great object of this Conference, and of much more than this Conference, is the co-ordination of all our efforts. This has been said over and over again, but it cannot be said often enough. We want to attack the enemy from all sides with the greatest possible energy. This involves two main considerations: 1. We want our attacks to be as far as.possible simultaneous. This is primarily a matter for arrangement between the military authorities of the several Allied States. And I am satisfied that, as far at any rate as the operations of this spring and summer are concerned, the distinguished Generals who are members of this Conference have come to such an understanding as will ensure the greatest simultaneity of effort which can possibly be- obtained, having regard to climatic and other difficulties. As far as this most important point is concerned, therefore, I feel that something definite and very valuable has been already achieved.^ 2. But there is another point also of great importance. Not only do we want our livided efforts to be as far as possible simultaneous, but it is likewise necessary chat each of these efforts should have the greatest possible momentum, and especially that the Russian military effort, which is of such immense importance to the general cause of the Allies, should be as strong as it is humanly possible to make it. The Russian military position in its broad outlines is familiar to all of us. The main points are not in dispute. Russia has as great, perhaps greater, man-power than the rest of the Alliance put together, and her soldiers fight with glorious courage and tenacity. She has also leaders, as experience has shown, of great energy and determination. But her immense army is not so fully, equipped with material of war, especially in its more important modern developments-1 am thinking especially of big-guns and aeroplanes as are, for instance, the armies of France and Great Britain, and she has also special difficulties to contend against in the matter of transportation and supply. Russia, therefore, naturally looks to her Allies to help her, if&apos;they can in 1382]&apos; B
making good these deficiencies, and she argues with unanswerable force that there could be no greater addition to the total strength of the Allied military effort than such an increase and improvement of her war material, as would enable her to use her enormous resources of man-power to the greatest effect. The question therefore is-it is the o-reat still outstanding question-to what extent and in what manner the Allies can help Russia in this respect ?The problem is not a simple one. It is comparatively easy to draw up a list of Russian needs. But it is not so easy to decide how far it is physically possible to supply those needs from outside R,ussia&apos;s own borders. And it is still less easy to say how far the Allies can supply them (either directly or by furnishing her with the means of buying them from other countries) without weakening themselves more than they strengthen Russia.The only point of view from which we ought to look at the matter is that of the total strength of the Allies. Subject to the inexorable physical necessities governing the transfer of men and things, all the men, all the material, all the money at the disposal of any of the Allies ought to be employed at that point where they can be em ployed with the most effect. I can well believe, therefore, that, having regard to the comparative strength of the Western Allies in war material, and the comparative weakness of Russia in that respect, it might be good policy to sacrifice some addition of strength on the Western front for the purpose of supplying Russia&apos;s urgent needs. For it is at least possible that an amount of material, which would not make any vitd difference to the result of the clash of enormous armaments on the Western front, might make the whole difference between success and failure on the Eastern front. This is a consideration of great weight, and one which would naturally incline us to give priority of consideration to Russia&apos;s needs at the present time. In all, I may say subsequently, I must be regarded as approaching the question with a disposition to lean in that direction, viz., towards giving the maximum possible amount of help, whether in material or in money to obtain the material (it comes to the same thing), to Russia.But, still looking at the question solely from the point of view of the maximum total strength of the Alliance, there are serious limitations to what can be done in this direction. The resources of the Western Allies are not inexhaustible. Their powers of production are already strained to the highest pitch, and the financial problem with which they are confronted has become one of the utmost gravity. It is necessary to recognise that the credit of Great Britain is the central pillar of the financial strength of the Allies; that this credit is being strained to the uttermost; and that, in order to preserve it, the severest restrictions must be placed upon the purchases of the Allies in neutral markets, so far as these have to be effected by means of that credit. This is not a specially British interest; it is the common interest of all the Allies. It is solely from the point of view of the common cause that I here insist upon it.Not only has Great Britain increased the burden of taxation resting upon her people since the war began more than any of her Allies, raising the normal rate ol income tax from 6 to the enormous figure of 25 per cent., while in the case of the largest incomes it amounts to as much as 40 per cent. She has also incurred a burden of debt for the purposes of the war exceeding 3,000 millions sterling, upwards of 800 millions of which has been spent for the Allies. These are tremendous figures, but the most serious part of the situation is that she has now pledged almost all her foreign securities to obtain loans in America for the purchase of war material for herself and her Allies; and the possibility of raising fresh loans abroad for this purpose to any considerable amount becomes more and more doubtful. It is now, therefore, a matter of supreme importance to the whole Allied cause to husband what remains of British credit (which is only another way of saying that what remains of the purchasing power of the Allies in neutral markets) with the most scrupulous care. For if this were to become exhausted, it is very hard to see how the war could be carried on.If, therefore, we examine the demands of Russia, whether for materials or money, and especially for money to be expended in neutral countries, with the most rigid care, we must not be regarded as doing this out of any regard for our own pockets. It is an ab?olute duty to do it. Not to do it would be a dereliction of duty to the cause of the Allies.Obviously the first thing to make sure of is that Russia does not obtain from the Allies anything which she could quite as easily, or more easily, produce for herself Russia, with her vast extent and varied resources, is probably, from the economic point of view, capable of becoming the most self-sufficient country in the world. But we must all admit that these resources are still largely undeveloped, and that, consequently
for the moment, there are a cumber of things, and even some things of absolute necessity, with which she cannot supply herself. But I am satisfied that she can even now do a great deal more than she is doing for herself, with better organisation. - .. . ...Ijdo not for a, moment, suggest that the Russian authorities deliberately ask their Allies to help them to obtain anything which, they do not believe to be both absolutely necessary, and unobtainable within their own borders. But I think they greatly under -estimate what Russia even now can produce. This is not a phenomenon peculiar to Russia. All the Allied countries have learned, under the stress of war, that their powers of production were many times greater than what any. of them, before the war, had the least idea of. They have all enormously increased&apos;their output, but the production of France and England (I cannot speak with the same personal knowledge about Italy) has now reached a point at which further increase is very difficult, if not impossible. Energy and organisation have pretty well done their utmost. But the same cannot be said of Russia. Goodwill is certainly not lacking on her part. She has shown no desire to spare herself-witness the enormous sacrifice of men which she has made in her gallant efforts, again and again repeated, to relieve the strain upon the Western Allies. But there is still lack of organisation. Bussia is still able to make more use of her own resources. When I was in Moscow I heard of many factories closing down for want of labour or for want of coal. And yet I am told that millions of men have been called out for service in the field, whom it is impossible to drill or to arm, and who are therefore withdrawn from industry without adding anything to the military strength of the country. Moreover, there are thousands of men in the field who would be of more use in the mines or the factories. Russia, it seems.to me, will have to do what England has had to do on a large scale, and bring back skilled workers, who were too hastily enrolled in the ranks, to the industrial employments for which they are indispensable.Again, although factories are stopping for want of coal I am assured that there is no absolute lack of coal or of wagons to move it, but that the distribution and circu-lation of the existing wagons is very defective. I am not myself in a position to confirm this statement. I can only say that it comes to me on good authority from several independent sources, all trustworthy and likely to be well-informed. The matter seems to demand most careful investigation, especially in view of the large demand now made for additional wagons to be imported from the United States. It is very doubtful whether additional railway wagons, if ordered in America, could be obtained within any reasonable time, as the orders already given are still far from completed, and all the works are choked with the existing demand. Even if the makers could supply them their transportation by sea would make a great hole in the available tonnage, which in any case falls far short of Russia&apos;s real and undoubted requirements. And they would, under existing circumstances, have to be bought at an exorbitant price. It is. therefore evident that it is bad business from every point of view to order a single fresh wagon from America, the need of which could be obviated by the better use of existing material. To do so would be an unjustifiable waste of the resources of the Allies.There are almost always two ways of making good a shortage of material. One is to increase the supply; another is to make better and more economical use of what one has already got. Russia, under existing circumstances, is absolutely obliged to have recourse to the.latter method by the inexorable facts of the situation. She simply cannot import from abroad all the material which she stands in need of. It does not exist, could not be created within reasonable time, and, if it were created, could not be brought into the country for want of-tonnage. Russia is thus absolutely driven back upon the necessity of a more systematic use of her own resources. To some extent all the warring nations have&quot; been obliged to do the same. Germany, especially, has been obliged to do so, and has, with conspicuous success, grappled.with the immense problem thus presented to her. France and England have, to a very large extent, been forced to adopt a similar course. We have all had to make shift with insufficient or inferior material where we could not get the. quantity or the quality.we desired, and have had to make good by inventiveness, and resourcefulness, and organisation the deficiency of supplies. Russia cannot complain of. having to do the same. And she is capable of doing it. it is impossible, in view of the splendid record of work done by newly created and volunteer organisations, like the zemstvos and cities unions, to doubt the capacity of her people to. rise to an emergency and to improvise new methods of dealing with it.^ I am extremely struck by what has happened in Russia in this respect, because it repeats and reinforces the lessons we have learned in England in the course of the war. The work to be done was altogether too great for the old machinery. We [382] ^ B2
could never have got through it without the creation of a number of new organisations, without enlisting innumerable volunteers to assist the regular employes of the Govern-ment, and even placing a number of them-men whose lives had been spent in private business and who were previously devoid of any official experience in some of the highest administrative posts.The war has not only immensely enlarged the scope, but entirely altered the character of British administration. And I think that no one will deny that the enlistment of a whole army of volunteer workers, and the bringing of experience from the professional and business world into direct participation in the business of govern-ment, has been the greatest possible success. We could not have got on without it. I will give one instance to illustrate my meaning. One of our greatest difficulties has been to keep our troops at the front in France supplied with the necessary provisions, war material, &amp;c. The means of communication were inadequate, railways and ports were becoming hopelessly congested, and there was apparently a total insufficiency of rolling stock. Altogether it was a most complicated problem of transportation. Some months ago the chief manager of one of our English railways was appointed the Director of Military Transport in France, with the rank of a general officer. He was a civilian who had hitherto had no official, much less military experience, but he was an expert in transportation. The appointment at first gave a shock to many preconceived notions, but it has proved a complete success, and is appreciated by no one.more than by the highest military authorities. Our Commander-in-chief in France himself told me, only a few weeks ago, how glad he was that the appointment had been made, and how greatly the army had benefited by it. I might add that another civilian new to official life has, still more recently, been appointed head of our Board of Trade, and is now responsible for the working of all British railways which have been taken over by the Government. He, too, has succeeded in effecting great improvements by the more economical use of our railway material. Our transportation problem, alike in Great Britain itself and in Northern France, is in a fair way to being solved, as far as it can be solved, by better management and by the recourse we have had to unofficial experts.I dwell upon these illustrations because they bring out two great lessons which the war has taught us in England, and I do not see why the experience which we have bought at a great price should not be available also for others. These lessons are, the enormous value of management in getting a greatly increased amount of work out of a given amount of material, and the wisdom of having recourse to the best experts-wherever they can be found, and wholly regardless of official traditions-and putting them into positions of authority in those branches of the Government service where technical skill is of supreme importance.This point is of all the greater weight, since the technical side the skilful use of the latest products of science and invention-now plays such an infinitely greater part than formerly in the conduct of the war. The value of much modern war material may be enhanced or diminished to an almost incredible degree by the way in which it is handled.It is for this reason that it seems to me of vital importance that any war material given to Russia by the Western Allies should be accompanied by a few men experienced in dealing with each particular type, and that they should have a free hand and all possible support in looking after the transportation and assembling * of the various engines, and explaining the use of them to those who will ultimately have to work them in the field. There is no question here of interference with the Russian military authorities. All we ask is to be allowed to assure ourselves that the war material we are handing over is handed over complete; that we are giving to Russia not only the machines but our experience, dearly enough bought, in the use of the machines; and that those machines get to the front in the shortest time possible, and in such condition as to produce their maximum effect when they have got there.It must not be forgotten that every particle of our material furnished to Russia is so much taken away from some other front. We have none of us got anything to spare. The Western Allies are far better off than Russia in respect of most forms of war material. But they are not, any of them, as well off as they could desire. They have not got, nor can the productive capacity of their own countries or of the neutral countries provide, all that is wanted within a reasonable time. Nevertheless we are willing to give material which we can ill spare ourselves. It is difficult to bring it here, but we are doing our best to get over that difficulty to guard the sea-ways and to keep the ports open. All we ask is&apos; to be allowed, to assure ourselves that the material, when Russia does get it, will be really useful.   Otherwise its transference will
be a dead loss to the-fighting strength of the Alliance, regarded as a whole. And the same applies to war material bought with money which Great Britain has to supply. There is an increasing difficulty in finding the means to pay for such material in neutral countries. -&quot;What is left of our credit is wanted to buy material for ourselves and for our other Allies. What we spend for Russia means so much less for us and for them. Nevertheless it is right to use it, and we are willing to use it, as far as it will go, to furnish Russia with as much material as it is physically possible to get to her, always provided that it is at least of as much use to her as it would be to us or one of the other Allies.It is from this point of view that any demands for assistance, addressed by one of the Allies to the others, should be tested. There is a limit to what the Allies can obtain in the shape of supplies from outside their own borders, a limit imposed by physical difficulties of production and transportation, and by the extent of their purchasing power. The first duty resting upon each one of them is to develop domestic production to the greatest possible extent. The Central Powers, almost entirely cut off from external sources of supply, have done this to an almost incredible extent by inventiveness and good organisation. It is incumbent upon the Allies, especially incumbent on Russia with her great natural resources, to imitate their example, as far as it is humanly possible to do so. And the second duty incumbent on the Allies is to distribute the material they have, or can still obtain, in the best way, by employing it at that part of the field of war where it can be most effective.Speaking for my own country, I can.say that there is nothing that Great Britain can do to help Russia that she is not prepared to do. Whole-heartedly and without reserve we will use up all our resources for the Alliance. All we ask in return, and this again not for our own sake but for that of the Alliance, is that Russia shall not draw upon us for anything wdiich, by the increase of her own production and by the better management of her own resources, she can provide for herself: and that, in taking over any material we may give her, she will avail herself also of our experience, so as to ensure that the fullest value may be got out of such material. If those conditions are fulfilled there are no limits save those imposed by insuperable physical obstacles or by the total exhaustion of our resources to the assistance which we are ready and anxious to give to an Ally in whom we have absolute trust, and who has herself made such enormous sacrifices for the common cause.(Initialled)        M.February 4/17, 1917.printed AT THE foreign oeeice bt C.
