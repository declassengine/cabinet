EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS.Memorandum prepared by the French Mission on the Estimated Output of Propellants and Explosives from Russian Factories.   (Translation.);   I. Propellants. The following table gives, for the first six months of 1917 :  (1) The probable Russian output of smokeless propellant for the army and the navy.   The figures are below the theoretical maximum production of factories; the
244reduction which has been made is based on the -actual output for) the preceding months. On the other hand, in certain of the factories i the plant will probably he: increased and extensions made, and this fact has been taken into account. :: The figures suppose a regular supply of raw materials, especially of nitrate of soda from foreign sources.(2) The requirements of propellant for guns of all calibres, trench mortars, rifles, and machine guns, as well as naval requirements. These figures do not; correspond to the maximum programme for shell manufacture, but fall below it. They are based on the possible output of ammunition.(3) The deficiencies which appear on a comparison of output and requirements.--	January.	February.	March.	April.	May.

There is reason to think that the filling factories will soon be in a position to make up arrears, and&apos; 640,000 pouds, or 10,000 tonnes will be consumed in this way. The stocks available to make up deficiencies in output are thus only 6,000 &quot;tonnes,&quot; and will be consumed in about two months&apos; time.Thus, if the fulfilment of the munitions programme is not to be hindered by lack of propellant, deliveries from foreign sources must be such as to supply a total amount of about 100 &quot; tonnes &quot; daily from March 1917, .......II. Explosives.The following table, like the preceding one, gives for the first six months of 1917:-        ^ &apos; .(1) The probable output of explosives from Russian factories. The figures fall below the maximum productive capacity of the factories. They suppose that the factories will use toluol, benzol, and nitrate of ammonia from Russian sources only. : t(2) The requirements of explosives for shells of all calibres, trench mortars, and hand grenades, as well as requirements for the navy and for military mining purposes.These figures do not correspond to the maximum programme for shell manu-facture, but fall below it.

Thus, for. 1916; three-quarters of the quantity promised (19,000 &quot; tonnes &quot;) reached its,destination. . The quantity promised for 1917 is also 19,000 &quot; tonnes,&quot;- and it is reasonable to suppose that three-quarters of this, or 14,000 tonnes, will arrive. This, added to the 5,600&quot; tonnes &quot; in stock on January 1st, will give a total of 53 &quot; tonnes &quot; per day &quot;available for mixing either* There is still considerable uncertainty as to the total amount of explosives allocated to trench mortars (estimated at 67 &quot;tonnes&quot; per day), and hand grenades (17 ^tonnes &quot;per dav). The total for the navy has been estimated at from 10 to 15&apos;&quot; tonnes.&quot;    &quot;* &apos;&apos;- C2
with trotyl at the actual time of filling, or with dinitronaphthaline or xylite, in schneiderite and ammonal factories. The productive capacity of these factories is satisfactory.In this way the monthly deficiencies are reduced to ahout 110 &quot; tonnes &quot; per day.The stocks of explosives on January 1st, 1917, exclusive of nitrate of ammonia and ammonal, amounted to 680,000 pouds, or 11,000 tonnes, but there was also a certain number of shells waiting to be filled. The filling factories will soon be in a, position to make up arrears, and 100,000 pouds of explosives (1,600 tonnes) will be consumed for this purpose. The stock available to make up deficiencies in output is thus only 9,400 tonnes, and this will be consumed in about three months&apos; time.Thus, if the fulfilment of the munitions programme is not to be hindered by lack of explosives, deliveries from foreign sources must be such as to supply a total of about 100 &quot; tonnes &quot; a day from April 1917. As it is raw material, rather than machinery, which limits the Russian output of explosives, a certain proportion of the supply from foreign sources might be in the form of benzol, toluol, or phenol. (End of memorandum.)The following tables give the output of propellant and explosives from Russian factories for each month of 1916, and the supplies received from abroad. A forecast for Russian output is also given; but the totals given in the table in the case of explosives differ slightly from those already given in tbe text. For propellants anticipated&apos; production is only given for the first half of 1917.

Administration des Chemins-;de-fer de 1&apos;Empire.   (Translation.) &apos;The problems presented by the war to those responsible for the &quot;Russian railway system were of a nature so urgent that, in order to solve them, all available resources in the way of transport had to be strained&apos; to their utmost. In particular, every effort had to be made to turn available; rolling stodk&apos; to the4 best &apos;possible account; and certain measures, of a technical as well as of an administrative nature, were adopted;-    ir0 4
The steps taken have given practical results. For instance, the average load of a goods truck of the ordinary type, 10&apos; 4 metric tons in times of peace (1913), was raised during 1916 to 11&quot; 2 metric tons; and the average length of line covered daily by a goods truck, which was 39 miles in 1913, rose to 46 miles in 1916. In the same way engines, which formerly covered on an average 53 miles a day, were, in 1916, made to cover 63 miles, while the figure for goods engines was raised from 68 to about 80 miles.It was only by taking these steps that it was possible to accomplish an amount of work which appears so large in comparison with that done in times of peace. The total length of line covered by goods trains and convoy trains, which was estimated at 147 million miles in 1913, in 1916 was more than 197 million miles ; that is, it has increased 34 per cent. The distance for trucks increased from 5&quot;6 thousand millions to 8*1 thousand millions; that is 44 per cent. Yet, although the utmost nse has been made of all rolling stock, it has not been possible to meet transport requirements, especially since these increase as the war continues.Moreover, goods imported from abroad which hitherto have arrived at ports on the Baltic and Black Sea, which are comparatively easy of access, have now to be conveyed great distances from the Pacific or the White Sea; and the average-distance which they have to be carried is, from Archangel about 1,190 miles, and from Vladivostock about 5,370 miles.The concentration of armies of several million men on the Austrian and German fronts necessitates, in its turn, the daily transport of munitions and provisions from districts as far away as Siberia and the country beyond the Volga. In the same way, goods have to be carried for more than 663 miles to the Caucasian front, which is separated by a range of mountains from the fertile valleys of the northern Caucasus. Moreover, the taking of Erzerum and Ersindjian has increased the difficulties of transport.In order to meet the pressing need for coal in Petrograd and north-western Russia generally, where the furnaces in times of peace were supplied with foreign coal, and where considerable industrial extensions have been made since the war, supplies have had to be obtained from the coalfields of the Donnetz basin. And for the transport of large quantities of coal, only the main lines of railways, whatever may be the existing congestion of their traffic, can be used.Nothing can give a better idea of the importance in Russia of the distance which has to be covered by railway lines than the fact that, whereas in times of peace the greatest distance covered by a goods train from its starting point to its destination was only about 385 miles, during the years 1915 and 1916 the distance increased 50 per cent., and reached the average figure of 577 miles.At the same time, military operations, involving the transport of troops to fill up the ranks, as well as the transport of munitions, have necessitated the organisation-in itself a difficult and responsible task of a very large passenger service ; and this organisation can only be maintained at the expense of the goods service., , These circumstances, amongst others, have brought about an ever increasing disproportion between the requirements of the export trade and transport facilities ; and as a result of the inadequacy of the railway system and the scarcity of rolling stock, the country is in a really serious position. The transport crisis (as regards locomotives and carriages) is made more acute by the fact that during the two years and a half immediately preceding the war, several new railway lines were built and brought into use, representing a total length of line of more than 3,650 miles. (The Armavir-Touapse, Altai, Boukhara, Archangel, Western Ural, Tchernomorsko-Koubanskaia lines, as weU as a whole system of lines at the front, &amp;c, &amp;c.) The traffic on these lines has appropriated a considerable number of engines and trucks. The same thing has happened in the case of the new Olonetz and Murman railways, which are already in use, and which will soon-during the summer become main lines.   (Total length, 829 miles.)Besides this, it was inevitable that the great strain to which rolling stock has been put should damage it; and in fact the continuous use of engines, together with the poor quality of the coal, which, owing to the scarcity of all kinds of fuel, is all that can be obtained, has resulted in a number of engines becoming worn out. Also, it should be remembered that there are fewer facilities for repair than existed formerly, owing to the present lack of metals and scarcity of repair shops. Con-sequently it will not be possible to continue to use rolling stock to the same extent as at present.      ...

These latter were of great importance from the point of view of supplying the army with munitions and provisions.Nearly 13,650 miles, or about 1,400,000 tons, of rails have been used in work of this nature from the beginning of the war up to January 1, 1917. 10,130 miles have been used in the construction of new lines and in the extension of existing lines on the two fronts; the rest, that is 3,520 miles, have been used for the extension of stations, reconstruction of lines which had been destroyed by the enemy, construction of auxiliary lines, replacement of defective or worn-out rails, and for other purposes of minor importance.The figure given above for the total number of rails used does not include 1,720 miles ^ of rails which had already been used on railway lines, and which were used again in fortified places. .Besides all that has already been accomplished, it is probable that during 1917 a good deal of work of this nature will have to be undertaken at the front, in order to leave nothing undone in this particular direction, to ensure the success of the coming strategical operations. Also, in consideration of these same operations, it is extremely important that the transport capacity of lines not actually serving the front should be increased.The extent of the work to be undertaken during 1917, in terms of.lengths of the lines to be built, has been fixed by a conference of representatives of the Ministry and of G-.H.Q. at 13,900 miles; this corresponds, in rails only, exclusive of material for joining them, to a tonnage of 1,397,000 &quot; tonnes.&quot;-&apos;* Metric tons (1,000 legs.).a   2685 V 8 AThese considerations only emphasize the difficulties of the situation which arises from scarcity of available rolling stock. It is only possible to conclude that the most vital interests of the State are suffering, and, under existing conditions, must continue to suffer from this state of affairs.It WOuld be of no avail to lay stress on the urgent needs of private industry and commerce ; it is enough to say that the shortage of trucks is actually impeding the activities of factories and works engaged on work of national importance. Also, it is possible that it will be necessary before long, in view of the extension of the offensive &quot;ordered by Headquarters, to send to the front 500 powerful engines and 25,000 trucks for use on lines actually serving the front, even though it should be necessary, in order to obtain them, to restrict the traffic on lines further back.It follows that the only possible solution of the problem lies in the immediate placing of an order abroad, and the delivery to Russia of a large number of engines and o-oods trucks. A preliminary estimate stated that the number of engines and trucks required for the whole Russian railway system was not less than 100,000 trucks and 2,500 engines. This number would provide all the transport facilities necessary in time of war, and, in a word, would meet the needs of the country.&apos; The preliminary estimate was submitted to the Special Commission on Transport, and the Commission, for reasons of a practical and- financial nature, reduced, this demand.Memorandum on the Quantity of Bails needed for Work to be undertakenduring 1917.(From the Ministere des Voies de Communication.   Translation.)The total length of line of the Russian railway system (exclusive of the Bukovina lines) actually in use on January 1, 1917, was 48,300 miles. This includes the following: Miles.
This - quantity of - rails, as is shown, in the attached table, is allocated as follows: Miles.(1) For the front, including Roumanian lines ... 6,440(2) For lines actually in use behind the front -         -         - 3,760(3) For the construction of new lines         - -         -        - 3,530(4) For Finnish railways     -         - - .      -    .    -:. 18713,917A certain proportion of these fails, which present the total tonnage of 1,397,000 &quot; tonnes,&quot; can be supplied by Russian factories, which, however, cannot produce more than 290,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; ; but in addition 353,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; are due on contracts placed with firms in America and China. Consequently, up to the present, the Ministry can only count on 643,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; ; that is, Russia will be short of the quantity she actually needs to the extent of 745,000 &quot;tonnes.&quot; This serious shortage of rails forced the conference of representatives of the Ministry and of G.H.Q. to divide the various needs into those which could not possibly be postponed after the first half of 1917 and those which could.For the urgent work, 683 miles, or 643,000 &quot;tonnes,&quot; of rails are required, and this quantity is guaranteed by the output of Russian factories and by contracts placed with foreign firms.The other classes of work, which the conference decided it would be possible to postpone, will require 754,000 &quot;tonnes&quot; exclusive of material for joining the rails. As the Russian factories cannot produce this quantity, the Ministry will be obliged to place a supplementary order abroad. If this last order should materialise, all requirements in rails would be fully met.As regards the destination of the rails, the quantity mentioned above is allocated to the following classes of work : (1) The greater part of the rails to be ordered 951,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; is needed for the construction of new lines and auxiliary lines. The chief object in view is the development of the railway system on the western and Caucasian fronts. Similar extensions. are needed on lines which serve the district immediately behind the front, in order to secure supplies to the front. Also, it is* hoped to increase the supply of munitions and provisions from Western Siberia and. the Far East by increasing the transport capacity of the lines which serve these districts. Besides this, the Ministry is considering the possibility of facilitating the export of food products, coal, and other mineral and industrial products of national importance by organising a series of circular routes, by which products could be collected from the place of their production. The shortage of rails for this class of work may be estimated at 532,000 &quot; tonnes.&quot;(2) Rails are needed for the extension of stations and for increasing the transport capacity of existing lines in the neighbourhood of the front, as well as of lines further back. 220,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; of rails will be needed for this purpose, and there is a shortage of 99,000 &quot; tonnes.&quot; The work mentioned in (1) and (2) can be carried out in proportion as the necessary rails are delivered.(3) 99,000 &quot; tonnes &quot; of rails will be needed to reconstruct lines destroyed by the enemy.s (4) 77,000 &quot;tonnes&quot; of rails will be needed to replace defective or worn-out rails, and there is a shortage of 44,000 &quot; tonnes.&quot; In this connection, it must be remembered that since the war far fewer rails have been delivered to Russian railways for purposes of repair than were required by the condition of the lines. As a consequence of this, the number of broken rails has perceptibly increased, and the condition of the lines generally may soon become positively dangerous. Thus, it is of great importance that the total quantity of rails needed for purposes of repair should be supplied.(5) The rails needed for work on light railways can be supplied from Russian i   ....     factories.All this work construction of auxiliary lines, extension of stations, repairs, construction of light railways,&apos; and of points is absolutely necessary, and the
requirements in rails cannot be reduced without seriously hindering the fulfilment of the task imposed on the Russian railway system during the present war.The quantity of rails required for the construction of new lines depends entirely on the length and number of the lines. Consequently, if on further consideration it should be decided to postpone the construction ofcertain parts of these lines, the total requirements in rails could be proportionately reduced.

The Russian supply is sufficient to meet requirements in the case of a number of substances corning under the control of the &quot; Intendance &quot; department, of which the most important are linen cloth, cotton cloth and sheepskins. A large supply of woollen cloth is required from England ; but the making of cloth into tunics, great coats, &amp;c, as well as the making of linen and cotton garments is to be done exclusively in Russia. The requirement of raw cotton for the manufacture of cotton cloth by the trade is dealt with in the section on Trade and Commerce.Table showing the chief Requirements of the Intendency for the Army from1st January 1917-lsi January 1918.

H. COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.(Precis of a Report furnished by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.)The power of placing orders for materials and machines for the Government factories at Oural, &amp;c, for the ports and for private firms on war work, is centralised in the following sections of the Ministry : 1. Mercantile Ports Section.2. Government Factories Section.3. Fuel Section.4. Industrial Section.1. Mercantile Ports Section.The requirements for mercantile ports are shown in a table at the end of this section, with notes giving the basis upon which the requirements are based.2. Government Factories Section.Since the war the Government factories have been used solely for manufacturing guns, shells, engineering machinery, bayonets, &amp;c, for the army, and locomotives for the railways.To satisfy all these orders these factories have had to be extended, and in order to furnish the new workshops with machine tools, lathes, &amp;c, orders have had to be placed abroad. The magnitude of these orders is shown in Table II. at the end of this section.To give some idea of the development of the factories under the control of the Ministry of Mines, the budget for these factories before the war was 20,000,000 roubles, while for 1917 it will be 180,000,000 roubles.3. Special Section for Fuel.The requirements of coal, naphtha, and wood for railways and for industries has increased since the beginning of the war. The importation of coal from abroad has dropped to a minimum, whilst the mining of coal and of naphtha in Russia cannot supply the requirements even of those industries doing War work. The chief causes of this state of affairs is lack of labour, and the limited number of machines.   The detailed requirements are&apos;shown in Table II.4. Industrial Section.The large demands for rubber are due to the increase in the number of automobiles at the front, and the way in which the bad state of the roads wears out tyres.As a result of the occupation by the enemy of certain territory, and the decrease in the number of cattle reared due to other causes, the home production of fats and oils has decreased. It is therefore necessary to import larger quantities than formerly not only of these but also of leather and wool.Jute, extracts for tanning, and food substances such as tea, coffee, rice, &amp;c, have always been imported.Comparatively unimportant articles such as cork, cloth, cement, candles, cotton and wool textiles, typewriters, matches, &amp;c. are included among &quot; other products &quot; in the table.The following notes on raw cotton and wool have also been supplied: COTTON.I.-Cotton needs during the Season 1916/17 from October 1st, 1916,to October 1st, 1917.The average number of hours worked by one spindle was, during 1915/16, 4,560. The quantity of cotton worked up by each spindle averaged 119 lbs. during the course of the year. The number of spindles working up to October 1st, 1916, totalled 7,881,208, and the total weight of cotton spun 425,500 metric tons.It is estimated that during 1916/17, 7,300,000 spindles will be at work. Assuming that each spindle works up the same amount of cotton as in 1915/16, the total quantity of cotton needed for 1916/17 is 394,000 metric tons.

Total amount of cotton stored on October 1st, 1916, reached about 370,000 metric tons :-116,000, plus 47,000, plus 177,000, plus 30,000.,III. The Requirements of Cotton from Abroad during the Year 1916-17.Owing to the conditions of Russian industry, and bearing in mind the immense territory and the -difficulties of transport, the stores of cotton lying idle in factories cannot be utilised without interfering with the general work of spinning mills. It is estimated that a stock of 130,000 metric tons is required for the regular work of spinning mills. Thus, the stores of fibre which can be utilised in re-working amount to about 240,000 metric tons (370,000 - 130,000 ^= 240,000). It wiU be shown from these figures that during 1916-17 it is necessary to import 154,000 metric tons of foreign cotton (394,000 metric tons - 240,000 metric tons = 154,000 metric tons).IV. The Distribution of Cotton which is presumed to be imported according to the different Countries of Origin.Of the 154,000 metric tons of cotton which have to be imported from abroad during 1916-17, about 26,000 metric tons will reach Russia from Persia and Afghan.   Allowing for this the amount of Egyptian and American cotton requiredA   2685 z,
is 128,000 metric tons. The needs of our factories for Egyptian cotton (which is the only cotton which can be used for making the highest grades of sewing cotton) in peace time was 24,000 metric tons. At.the present moment when all factories are engaged in making heavier materials the needs are somewhat less. Altogether from October 1st,&quot; 1915, to October 1st, 1916, about 16,000 metric tons of Egyptian cotton was worked. This represents the minimum requirements of the Russian Cotton Industry for Egyptian cotton. It is true that the stores of Egyptian cotton in the country on October 1st, 1916, cover half the yearly requirements of our factories and therefore exceed the proportion considered necessary in the case of other kinds of cotton. But it must be borne in mind that during the last year the country has been in great need of sewing cotton, of which very often there has, not been sufficient for factories on War work. Moreover, the stores of Egyptian cotton have been very much enlarged by increased imports during the last months of the past season May to September 1916. It must be observed that during 1915-16 Russian spinning manufacturers engaged in working Egyptian cotton were obliged often to diminish their production on account of want of raw materials. Allowing for the 16,000 metric tons of Egyptian cotton, the requirements for American cotton is 112,000 metric tons.V.

The Amount of Cotton necessary to be imported by the End of the Season 1916-17.*Deducting from the requirement of 112,000 metric tons of American cotton the 15,000 tons of American, Indian, and Chinese cotton which, on the 1st of October 1916, was en route to Russian ports-the quantity of American cotton which will have to be imported by the end of the season is reduced to 95,000 metric tons. In the same way the amount of Egyptian cotton which will have to be imported before the end of the season is about 11,000 metric tons.Total quantity of cotton which must be imported before October 1st, 1917, is thus 106,000 metric tons.VII. Imports of Cotton from Abroad in 1915-16 were as follows: Quantity in metric tons.October 1915	-    7,570November	-    6,530December-	-    7,950January 1916	-    8,180February -	-        -  11,580March     -         -	-    8,160April      -         -         -      .   .	-    8,320May	-   11,240June	-    9,720July	-  11,060August	-    9,220September	-    7,980Total	- 107,510
During the season&quot;1915-16 the total imports of cotton amounted to 107,510 metric tons. It is estimated that 106,000 metric tons will have to be imported during 1916-17. iWOOL.The total quantity of Eussian merino wool shorn in 1916 is stated approximately as 16,320 metric tons of greasy wool, which when washed is reduced to about 30 per cent, of the total, making only 4,800 metric tons of clean wool. This wool was received by consumers by about May 1916. The present stock of wool is 1,200 metric tons, and calculating the monthly consumption of wool as equal to one-twelfth of the annual crop, it will be evident that at the present time there is only sufficient wool in the country to last three months.The stores of wool which are in the hands of traders and sheep-breeders are very small, and, (according to information furnished by the Committee on Cloth Industry on the 25th January) amount to about 545 metric tons of greasy wool, which is equal to about 164 metric tons of washed wool. The remaining 1,036 metric tons are at the present moment in the hands of manufacturers suppliers of the &quot; Intendency,&quot; and also in wool-washing mills. From traders and wool-washing mills, the wool will pass exclusively to factories engaged in working for military departments.Considering that our stores of merino wool are insufficient to meet the demands of factories engaged in preparing uniform cloth for army needs, it is necessary to import wool from abroad. According to the official information of the custom house statistics, from January 1st to December 1st, 1916, there was imported : Uncombed and unspinned wool: Greasy WashedThe quantity of greasy wool as shown above would be reduced in process of cleansing to about 320 metric tons.Thus during eleven months of 1916 there was imported up to 8,800 metric tons of washed wool, so that the total annual quantity of imported wool may be estimated at 9,600 metric tons of washed wool.During 1917 it is considered necessary to import from abroad 11,330 metric tons of washed wool required for manufactories engaged in making uniform cloth, divided up as follows : Warp   -----   4,500 metric tons.-Weft    -        -        -        -        -  3,330    ,,      ,, (including skin-wool, pieces and locks, also shortcape)Botany noils    -        -        -        -   3,500    ,, ^ In addition to above, 1,280 metric tons of wool are required for botany spinningWarp scoured wool Weft    -Greasy woolThe apparent increase in. the requirements of wool from abroad can be explained, partly by the increased output of cloth manufacturers who supply the army, and partly by the possible reduction of sheepbreeding owing to military action, which may extend to places in the neighbourhood of our sheepbreeding districts.e 2640 metric tons. 8,480   ,,     ,,- 640 metric tons.- 240   ,,     ,,. 400    ,,

The total requirement is thus 724- 2/3-72=120.One floating craue is required for every 5 boats waiting to be unloaded in the ports of Archangel, Romanoff, Kem or Soroka. As there is an average of 100 boats in these harbours at any time the total requirement . 100is - - 20.   Of these two-thirds should obe of 100 tons and the remainder 40-60 tons.Floating cranes for unloading coal into barges for transport on the rivers are needed, able to deal with 200 tonnes of coal per hour.It is proposed to coal the ice-breakers by means of elevators with a view to reducing to a minimum the time spent in coaling. The length of each section of the elevator should be about 12 metres.To keep the harbours at Archangel, Kem, and Romanoff of a proper depth, it is necessary to extract 6,300,000 m3 of mud per year. With the present equipment it is only pos-sible to extract 4,000,000 m3, and to extract the remaining 2,300,000 m3 five fresh equipments are required.The following number of tugs are required : (1) 8 tugs for the use of the 67 barges in use at the various poits ; (2) 30 tugs for the use of the 15 dredgers ; (3) 10 tugs for the use cf boats in the harbours and the 18 floating cranes ; (4) 6 tugs for various uses including the construction of the port; (5) 12 tugs for pumping and salvage; giving a total of 66 in all. (The figures given in the table only add up to 60.)These are required for the ports of Archangel, Romanoff&apos;, Kem and Vladivostok. They should be probably 6 tons a piece.These are required for use at the same ports as above.In all the ports in the White Sea and the coast of Mourman there is only one large floating dock and a small one at Archangel. It is therefore necessary to procure two additional ones, one of which should take 5,000 ton ships. ,The requirements have been based on the experience of the last year.In addition to the ice-breakers already in use it is necessary to have two large ones and three small ones. In addition it is necessary to have special boats with the bows strengthened to 60,000-70,000 tons to follow the ice-breakers. These should make two to three journeys to England during the winter.

I.-AGRICULTURE.Precis of a Statement of Ministry of Agriculture.Memorandum to Explain the Table Issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Dealing with Orders proposed to be Placed Abroad.I.At the beginning of the European war the Ministry was charged by the Cabinet Council with the important duty of supplying victuals and fodder for the army. The transactions undertaken by the Ministry were extended later on to include an increasing quantity of purchases for the Allies (sic).The circumstances attendant upon a state of war were very seriously reflected in the conditions of rural economy in the majority of the most fertile districts of the country owing to the withdrawal of men for the army and the emigration of the rural population to the towns to engage in manufactures. At the same time the supply of labour in the villages was considerably diminished, the agriculturist was no longer able to obtain from abroad such necessary commodities as agricultural machinery and manures. The supply of these from home sources was inadequate before the war, and has become more, so since, owing to lack of labour. It has been found necessary to increase the felling of timber in order to secure a sufficient supply of firewood,- and to satisfy the demands of the Ministry of War. Peat bogs have been turned to account in order to obtain fuel, and other work of a hydrotechnical nature has been undertaken.Lack of labourers on the one hand, and on the other lack of good agricultural machinery, which might have made up to a considerable extent for the scarcity of labour, have resulted in a perceptible decrease in the area sown. In these circumstances the Ministry considers it absolutely necessary that imports should include agricultural machines, and commodities such as chemical manures, insecticides, &amp;c, which will ensure good and increased crops. The manufacture of such commodities in Russia is quite insignificant.The following figures show the decrease which has occurred since the war in the cultivated area in the whole of Russia, excluding Eastern Siberia and Turkestan: Million Acres. Million Acres.1911      -     -     -242 1914      -     -     -   2541912 - . - - 239 1915 - - - 246 1913      -     -     -  249         1916      -     -     -  219In view of the fact that the decrease shown above (between 1914 and 1916) is already 15 per cent, of the total area of land sown, and is equivalent, in production, to from 8 to 11 million metric tons of cereals, representing the whole amount exported in times of peace, it is impossible to contemplate a further reduction with equanimity, as it might well involve seriously decreased supplies of food for the country and the army, besides endangering the supply of cereals to the Allies.The Ministry of Agriculture considers it absolutely essential, in order to avoid these dangers, that Russia should import the commodities, materials and machines enumerated in the table drawn up by the Ministry.II.The&quot; orders to be placed by the Ministry of Agriculture are classed in three groups : (a) Supplies for the &quot; Intendance &quot; Department.&apos;&quot;&apos;(b) Agricultural machinery, &amp;c.(c) Machinery needed for work in forests and hydrotechnical work.(a) Supplies for the &quot; Intendance &quot; Department.^The requirements of the Ministries of Agriculture and War in sacks, rice and presses for fodder, have been estimated, after consultation with the Director-General of &quot;Intendance,&quot; * as follows : (1) Sacks-Yiom January 1st, 1917, to January 1st, 1918, 19,200,000 metric tons of: food products will be required for the Army, and for this quantity 300,000,000*. This term appears to indicate the Department charged with procuring supplies of food, clothing, &amp;c.
sacks will be needed. Assuming that about one-third of the sacks, i.e., 100,000,000, are returned from the front, and that it will be possible to procure 70,000,000 sacks in Russia, the number required from abroad is estimated at 130,000,000, representing an approximate weight of 68,700 metric tons, and a value of 3,200,0001. sterling. (Order to be placed in England.)(2) Rice. From January 1st, 1917, to January 1st, 1918, it will be necessary.to supply the Army with a total. quantity of 672,000 metric tons of grain. Of this quantity, Russia can produce 576,000 metric tons:-buckwheat, millet, barley, oats, manna, maize and various vegetable products, such as lentils, peas and -beans. There then remain to be provided 96,000 metric tons of rice, which is required by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army to add to the men&apos;s rations as a preventive of gastric diseases, especially of cholera. This rice could also partly take the place of buck-wheat, which is not produced locally in sufficiently large quantities. Of this quantity of rice, 32,000 metric tons can be obtained from Persia, and it will be necessary to import 64,000 metric tons from Japan, of a value, in Japanese money, of 12,000,000 yens.(3) Presses for Fodder. 2,700 presses must be supplied. Of these, 700 can be made in Russia, and 2,000 (700 worked by hand, and 1,300 horse-drawn) must be imported. These presses can be obtained from America, and they represent a volume of 4,400 cubic &quot;tonnes,&quot; and a value of 708,000 dollars. In addition, 500 sets of spare parts are required, representing a volume of 200 cubic &quot; tonnes &quot; and a value of 70,000 dollars.(6) Agricultural Machinery, &amp;c.The extreme difficulty referred to above as having been experienced during the war in obtaining agricultural machinery from abroad is illustrated by the following figures of the total imports of agricultural machinery in the last three years : Metric Tons.1914    - - -    -     -   95,2001915    - -     -    4,1001916 (11 months)  -      -      -    9,500. The orders for agricultural machinery are principally for reaping machines.. These are machines capable of taking the place, to a large extent, of farm labourers.Many of the farmers have not sown, in the fear of not being able to reap : thus, in order to prevent a further reduction in the area sown, it is absolutely necessary that the farmers should be assured that reaping machines will be imported, and that they will receive them in time. Each of these machines will ensure the harvesting of cereals over an area of 220 acres and every 16 kilogrammes of twine, an area of from 12 to 13 acres. The absence of the 83,000 machines and of the 16,000 metric tons of twine ordered for 1917 woiild endanger the harvesting of an area of 33 million acres, representing nearly 20 per cent, of the Avhole area under cultivation. This would be a disaster for the country.It is, moreover, of the utmost necessity that the orders for reaping machines for 1918 should be placed at latest during May or June of this year, so that manufacturers will have time to complete the orders, and the machines will reach Russia at the end of 1917. The home manufacture of reaping machines was very small before the war and has practically ceased now that most of our factories are working only to meet the needs of the army.The decrease in the number of cattle used for draught purposes gives a peculiar importance to agricultural tractors which, though hitherto little used, will be more and more in demand. These tractors are not made at all in Russia. For 1917, 350 tractors have been ordered, and the Ministry intends to order 2,000 for 1918. Amongst other machines which have already been ordered, or which are to be ordered during 1917 for 1918, must be mentioned the following machines, which are of great importance to the country: machines for the manufacture of cord; machines for drying fruits and vegetables ; machines ordered by the &quot;Intendance&quot; for the pre-paration of fodder; machines for extracting the seeds of.fodder-producing plants; small tools ; and spare parts for repairing agricultural machinery.i Finally, before the war, Russia made use of nearly 5,000,000 scythes which came entirely from Austria.   The home production of scythes at the present time amounts
to 1^ millions, and will probably increase to 2\ millions.   It follows that the order, for scythes which: the Ministry proposes to place abroad (500,000 ordered and 1,000,000 to be ordered), is still far from meeting the actual needs of the country.Orders for twine are estimated closely by the Ministry of Agriculture on the. actual requirements of the country, and are exclusive of twine manufactured at home, -which amounts to from 32,000 to 48,000 metric tons (hempen twine).   This order will ensure the utilisation of the binding machines already in existence in the country, and the Ministry is anxious to deliver&apos;the twine up to time.The seeds, of fodder-producing plants and vegetables were imported in large quantities even before the war, and especially from Germany. In spite of all the steps which have been and are being taken to extend the local raising of seed, a very complicated process and one which demands vast organisation and considerable manual labour, the Ministry is obliged, in order to meet the needs of the country and of the army, to obtain from abroad (Denmark and England) vegetable and fodder seeds, chiefly for root crops.The necessity of extending our pharmaceutical industry obliges us to get from abroad the seeds of medicinal plants.Before the war silk worm eggs were imported almost entirely from Turkey (the Bagdad kind). Profiting by the absence from the market of Turkish eggs, the Ministry of Agriculture has taken the necessary steps to propagate European eggs in Russia. 70,000 zolotniks (288 kilogrammes) have already been ordered from Italy, and an option has been obtained for a similar quantity for 1918, in order to meet the growing requirements of silk for the army. In addition, it is expected that 1,120 kilogrammes of eggs will be prepared in Russia.Manures. Russia in Europe (exclusive of districts occupied by the enemy) needs for 1917, 75,000 metric tous of superphosphates. For the year 1918 the requirements will amount to 192,000 metric tons, on the supposition that the provinces occupied by the enemy will be free. For the 1917 requirements Russian manufacturers will produce about 32,000-55,000 metric tons of superphosphates; and it is hoped, if circumstances are favourable, that 19,000 metric tons will be obtained in 1917 from France, to pay for which the sum of 2,280,000 roubles must be forthcoming. In 1918 the national factories will probably produce from 48,000. to 64,000 metric tons, according to the quantity of acid which can be supplied by the Ministry of War.Insecticides. The total quantity of these commodities wanted for 1917 and 1918 amounts to 11,400 metric tons : 8,000 metric tons,of sulphate of copper; 3,200 metric tons of flowers of sulphur ; and 80 metric tons each of arseniate of copper, chloride of barium and formaline. Orders for 9,000 metric tons of insecticides have been placed partly in England; and partly, through the Committee in London, in France and Italy. It is thought that Russia may be able to manufacture nearly 2,400 metric tons of sulphate of copper, thus making up to the total of insecticides to the 11,400 metric tons required.(c) Machinery for Felling and Working Timber and Hydrotechnical Work.Timber. The war has forced the Ministry of Agriculture to take urgent measures in order to turn to account the State forests with a view to meeting the requirements of the Army in timber of various sorts, and the requirements of the country in fuel. As the war went on, and as more men were summoned to the colours, work in the forests diminished, until the needs of the Army could no longer be met. Under these circumstances the Ministry of Agriculture was obliged to undertake to supply the Ministry of War with materials which could no longer be bought, and which were necessary for various purposes (rifle butts, oak planks, hubs and rims of wheels, &amp;c). In addition the Department of Woods and Forests arranged to meet railway requirements for wooden sleepers, and is contemplating working the forests in the Northern Districts for export.For this purpose it is necessary to increase the plant in existing saw mills, and to build new ones, as well as new factories for working the wood, and to organise the despatch of timber for shipment, &amp;c.Since it will be impossible to procure all the necessary machinery, &amp;c, in Russia, &quot;the Ministry has under consideration the following orders to be placed abroad : (1) The tools, &amp;c, for seven carpenters&apos; shops to turn out: -(a) Waggons.(b) Window frames and doors to be used in restoring houses in districtswhich have suffered from the war.
(2) Sawing machines.(3) Motor Lorries, )  for transporting the material to the railways, arsenals,(4) Steamships,    j     factories, &amp;c.(5) Plant for making railway sleepers.(6) Tools (saws and axes) for manual labour in forests.  .Hydrotechnical work. The more important work of a hydrotechnical nature, actually under way and due to the war, can be classified as follows :--(1) Work in the peat bogs, with the object of supplying peat to the railways which serve the front, and to factories engaged on army work.(2) The supply of water to the armies for drinking and sanitary purposes.(3) Constructional work in connection with the allocation of State land to those who are taking part in the war, the making of roads and railways, aerial and narrow gauge, to serve the front; the setting up of shops and power stations.To carry out the various kinds of works enumerated above, the following machines and accessories must be obtained from abroad : For (1) Traction engines and driving bands. For (2) Mechanical borers, pipes and cables.For (3) Excavators ; rolling stock, steel cables for aerial railways, rails and fishplates ; machines for constructional work and a complete set of plant; turbines, generators, motors and their accessories.III.The total value of orders proposed to be placed abroad amounts to 163,568,860 roubles (about 17,000,000L), including a sum of 5,888,640 roubles (613,000L) already guaranteed, 4,328,640 roubles (451,000?,) for America, and 1,560,000 roubles (162,0001.) for Sweden.STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF. AGRICULTURE.Supplemental Notes (Precis).I. The Decrease in the Area of Land under Cultivation.European as distinct from Asiatic Russia. Tt has been stated that the decrease in land used for cereal crops in Russia as a whole decreased by 15 per cent, between 1914 and 1916. It has, however, to be borne in mind that Asiatic Russia, which has itself suffered a diminution in the area cultivated, at present does little more than satisfy its own needs, the surplus of cereals on the latest figures being only 11 million quarters. Moreover, great difficulties exist at present in connection with railway transport.Taking into account European Russia only, the decrease in the area used for cereals between 1913 and 1916 was 18&apos; 5 per cent, as compared with 15 per cent, in the whole of Russia.   The figures are as follows : 	Land cultivated for Cereal Crops.		1913.	1916.Whole of European Russia      -      -      - -    -European Russia, excluding Poland and other districts occupied by the enemy.	98&apos;8 million hectares (244 million acres). 87 &quot;5 million hectares (216 million acres).	80-5 million hectares (198 million acres). 80 &quot;5 million hectares (198 million acres).The crops which have suffered most in European Russia owing to this decrease are summer-sown wheat, rye, and barley. The area of summer-sown wheat has been reduced by 9 million acres, that of rye by 21- million acres, and that of barley bv 1,800,000 acres.II. The Corn Supply and the Needs of the Population.The total harvest of foodstuffs throughout the Empire, including oats, but not potatoes, varied in the last few years before the War from 300 to 400 million quarters, which was not only fully sufficient for the needs of the population, but permitted theX  2685 tt
export of a very considerable quantity of the grain, the amount exported varying from 40 to 60 million quarters.The following deficiencies now have to be taken into account  Quarters.Deficiency due to decrease in area cultivated in 1916 Deficiency due to decrease of autumn sowings in EuropeanRussia in 1916        -        -        -        -Deficiency due to decrease in 1917 in area used for summercrops (assuming 10 per cent, decrease as in 1916)   -Total   - -   66 millions.The population of European Russia on January 1st, 1917, may be put at about 150 millions, assuming that only a quarter of the population of Poland and two-thirds of the population of the Western provinces have migrated to the interior. This figure includes the Army and therefore a part of the male inhabitants of Asiatic Russia.Estimating the normal consumption of corn-stuffs at 1&apos;6 quarters per head yearly, the total quantity necessary for 150 million people is about 240 million quarters. According to recent figures an acre yields 1^ quarters of corn of all kinds, and on this basis the area needed for the production of the above-mentioned quantity of corn must be about 190 million acres, without counting the area needed for oats and oil-yielding plants and other crops. As has already been mentioned above, the area of all field cultivation has been already reduced in 1916 to 198 million acres, and a further reduction may certainly be anticipated in 1917 owing to the increasing lack of labour.In these circumstances it can only be reckoned at the most that the production of cereals in European Russia will be a quantity which will barely suffice for the needs of the Army and the civil population. As already stated, a material importation into European Russia of surplus corn from Asiatic Russia cannot be expected, having regard to the insignificance (according to approximate figures less than 11 million quarters) of this surplus and the great difficulties of railway transport.A considerable increase in grain production in European Russia is, however, still quite possible, given an increase in intensive cultivation and especially the more widespread use of artificial manures, as well as the extension in the ensuing spring of the sowing of summer crops, if the agriculturalists could be assured that there is a possibility of their receiving in time the necessary harvesting machines and other instruments which will to some extent make good the lack of labour.In the south and east of European Russia, which is in a large measure the granary of the population, summer crops often occupy from two-thirds to five-sixths, and even a larger proportion of the cultivated area. Thus, it would have been possible under favourable agricultural conditions to have made good the deficiency in autumn-sown crops last year by the more extensive sowing of summer crops. This region of European Russia is occupied chiefly in the cultivation of wheat and barley, i.e., the main items of exported corn. The area devoted to these grains could be extended first and in the greatest measure.Peasant Prop^ietorshij). It may be noted that the amount of land under cultivation by peasant proprietors in European Russia (excluding the occupied terri-tories) increased by 29 million acres between 1913 and 1915. This increase does not, however, represent an increase in the amount of land under cultivation, but a transfer to peasant proprietorship of land which was previously held by landlords and cultivated by the peasant under certain conditions, such as on a basis of half profits. Owing to the considerable rise in prices and in the cost of labour and other unfavourable economic conditions, it was found necessary to transfer the ownership of the land in question to the peasants.45 millions.7 &quot; ,;&apos;14
