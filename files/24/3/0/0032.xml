i 3THE CANCELLING OF EXEMPTIONS GRANTED TO MEN BETWEEN13 AND 22.I. Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. II-Memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue. III. Memorandum by the Board of Customs and Excise.I. ,I CIRCULATE to my colleagues two memoranda. one from the Board of Inland Revenue, the other from the Board of Customs. I have gone carefully into this case, and am satisfied that it would be a great mistake to put into the Army any of the four classes referred to in the memoranda, namely : (1) Surveyors and assistant surveyors ; (2) estate duty officers ; (3) waterguard, and (4) customs and excise officers.This is not a question of clerical work but of experts, who seem to me to be necessary, both for the collection of revenue and, in the case of the customs officers, for the execution of necessary war work.The total number involved is 622..     (Initialled) A. B. L.February 9, .1917.II.Further Releases of Inland Revenue Officials for Military Service.1. In accordance with your instructions to us of this morning, we submit the following observations on the circular letter, dated the 6th instant, from the Director-General of National Service.2. The budgets of the past few years have involved an expansion of this Depart-ment, amounting in effect to the creation of a large new Department, and the increase in the volume of the work has been accompanied by the Introduction of further complexities into duties already of a highly technical character. (It may be mentioned that the receipt of the duties under our management in 1908-9 was 62,000,0001.,.in 1913-14 wras 88,000,0001., while for the current vear we anticipate a receipt of not less than 365,000,000?,)3. It follows that the proportion of young officials is extraordinarily high at the present time.4. The Department may, roughly, be said to consist of (a) a large central staff located at Somerset House, Edinburgh, and Dublin, and (b) a tax surveying branch, scattered over the whole country in between 000 and 700 district offices, and (c) a land valuation branch, with about 100 local offices.5. As regards (a) and (cj-long before the receipt of the circular letter we had released (so far as fit for general military service) all second division clerks under 26 years of age, all assistant, clerks under 31, all permanent valuation officials under 31 (any temporary valuation officials being left entirely to the discretion of the military tribunals), and practically the whole mechanical staff up to 41.G. As regards (b) i.e., the tax surveying branch our-difficulties were, and are, immense, for the reasons given in the correspondence (of part of wdiich you have had copies) between us, the Man-Power Distribution Board, and the Director-General. [244-8]SECRET. G.-127.
7. The branch consists of surveyors and assistant surveyors and tax clerks. Below the age of 23 there are still at work about 120 of the former (whose medical classification is not known) and about 350 of the latter, who have been passed fit for general military service (i.e., Class A).8. With regard to the surveyors and assistant-surveyors, we need hardly emphasise to you that this body is the pivot of our tax system. The shortage of fully trained men is so serious that the withdrawal of the 120 men just mentioned (the great majority of whom have, at all events, had some years technical experience) would re-act disastrously on the ability of a service, already very severely tried, to maintain the revenue so urgently required for the war. You will remember that this staff is responsible for the efficient conduct and productivity of the hundreds of local tax offices which task has been rendered infinitely more difficult by the absence of adequately trained clerical staff.We therefore regard the retention of these 120 men as essential.9. With regard to the tax clerks, we should mention that 400 further releases (authorised by us before receipt of the Director-General&apos;s circular letter) are now proceeding. The circular letter involves the release (as stated above) of about 350 more.In the case of these 350 men whom we had hoped in any event to release by degrees as the training of substitutes progressed we earnestly desire to keep them, if it be at all possible, for a few weeks longer, so as to obviate the great dislocation and difficulty attending the simultaneous departure of so large a number as 750.This interval of a few weeks would enable us to recruit, and give some rudimentary training to, the female substitutes we should engage in continuation of the policy under which some 1,300 women are already employed in our local tax offices.10. Apart from the Tax Surveying Branch, there is one matter, fortunately affecting only a small number of men, to which we ought to draw your attention.In our Estate Duty Office there are 34 technical officers who would be affected by the Director-Generals circular. The work of that office is highly technical; the technical establishment of 345 has already been reduced to 285, and the withdrawal of approximately one-eighth of this balance (there being no reservoir of substitutes) could only be contemplated with misgiving.E. E. NOTT-BOWER, N. F. W. FISHER.Board of Inland Revenue, February 8, 1917.III.Memorandum by the Board of Customs and Excise.I received to-day from the National Service Department a letter from Mr. Neville Chamberlain saying that &quot; in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet he has to direct that every Government Department shall forthwith cancel all exemptions granted by their authority to men up to and including 22 years of age and passed fit for general military service.&quot;I feel bound to call your attention at once to the effect this will have on my Department.If the Order were confined to men doing clerical work, I should not trouble you, as Order would not&apos; affect this Department. We have combed our clerical staff drastically, and we have no clerks fit for service under 23.But the Order, as worded, is not so limited, and I am bound to interpret it as applying to our outdoor service.This means that we must surrender at once the following numbers : Waterguard, 168.Customs and Excise officers, 300.The work done by these two classes, and the reasons for regarding them as entitled to special treatment, were fully&quot;explained in a memorandum which we sent to the Man Power Board m October last ; they mav be summarised as follows :--
Work of the Customs and Excise Outdoor Service.The work falls under three main heads : I. Revenue;2. Old-Age Pensions ;3. Special war work undertaken for other Departments, principally War Office and Admiralty ;and it is to the last of these three heads that I specially wish to call your attention, for two reason?, first, because my Department is the only Department doing such work, and, second!)-, because the work itself is most important.Waterguard Serv ice.The primary duty of the Waterguard is to prevent smuggling. Their work necessitates a continuous watch over ships, and all-night attendance is a regular feature of service. Since the war their revenue duties have been overshadowed by constantly increasing demands for the performance of non-revenue Avar work ; for example, the rummage of ships for concealed contraband dor mines; the enforcement of the restrictions on the landing and embarkation of aliens ; the control of all goods shipped as ship&apos;s stores, especially such dangerous goods as petrol or lubricants, which might reach enemy submarines; the control of coal and fuel oil as bunkers ; the search of passengers&apos; luggage (outwards as well as inwards) for the numerous things which in war have to be watched ; Control of wireless instalments of ships in port.The work constantly increases, the staff steadily diminishes, and no substitutes can he found. A service whose members ought to be able to row a boat in a gale and then crawl about the ballast tanks of a ship cannot be recruited from old or medically unfit men or women.Customs and Excise Officer Grade.1. Revenue Work. Essentially skilled work, some of it highly technical, requiring considerable training; assessment of duties Customs and Excise; supervision of breweries, distilleries, tobacco factories, match factories, aerated water factories.2. Old-Age Pension Work. Intricate and difficult, and much criticised. The officers are Treasury watch dogs over an expenditure of 13 millions a vear.3. War Work.--(a.) Detailed control of all exports and imports, to enforce import and export prohibitions, to detect trading with the enemy (an immense amount of responsible work, involving knowledge of intricate instructions, varying from day to day).(6.) For Foreign Office. Reporting details of cargo compiled from the manifests and bills of ladings of diverted and calling ships for purposes of blockade.(This work involves a minute scrutiny of the ship&apos;s papers (often several hundred documents), and not only extracting all the information the Foreign Office require, but picking up any unusual or suspicious circumstances which may influence the Foreign Office decision on the cargo as a whole or individual items of cargo. And not only must the work be done with the greatest care, but it must be done in the least possible time, mistakes or delay being equally undesirable from a diplomatic point of view.) (c.) For Admiralty. Giving confidential verbal instructions to masters of out-going ships as to routes, &amp;c. (any mistake involving verv serious consequences).(d.) F br Treasury. Investigation of claims for additional allowances by old-age pensioners suffering special hardship in consequence of the war; work intricate in character, claims about 1.000,000, and any delay in investigation certain to give rise to complaints in Parliament.(e.) For the War Office and Admiralty. Investigating claims to separation allowances by the dependants of unmarried sailors and soldiers ; work, though analogous to the old-age pension work in time of peace, entirely new, calling for much careful investigation; over 1,700,000 claims already dealt with; work was further complicated and increased in March, 1915, by the institution of a system of appeals, necessitating a re-investigation of some 70,000 cases.Continuous Pressure of Work in Customs and Excise Officer Grade.Since the war the work has constantly increased, and the staff, already depleted by the absence of men with the colours, has steadily wasted from natural causes.
We have only kept our heads above water by relaxing our revenue safeguards to a dangerous extent, by recalling pensioned men, and by employing women. There has been constant overwork and we at one time feared a strike.Even with all our efforts the war work suffered. We could not get through the Separation Allowance claims fast enough to satisfy either the War Office, or the Admiralty, or the public, still less ourselves.When we reported to the Man Power Board in October last, we said that we were ,not in a position to spare a single man from the Customs and Excise Officer Grade. By this we did not, of course, mean that any particular young officer could be branded indispensable no individual is indispensable but that the numbers of men in the grade at our disposal to employ wherever there was pressure could not be safely diminished.Present Position.Since October, some of the war work has diminished, and some of a temporary nature has been disposed of ; we have carried dilution of staff farther, and we decided last month to release voluntarily arnd at once 150 men of the Customs and Excise Officer Grade These we are now selecting, and hope to be able gradually to comb out some more.As to the Waterguard, the position is unchanged : i.e. We ought not to spare a single man.If we have to surrender at once 300 Customs and Excise Officers and 168 Water-guard our machine must fail, and it will fail over war work as much as over Revenue or Old-Age PensionsIt is on behalf of war work that I specially appeal to you. I cannot believe that, if they kuow the facts the War Cabinet will jeopardise it for some 300 raw recruits, and I hope you will see your way to ask that, either by way of formal exemption or by confidential directions to me, the two classes of officers known as (1) Waterguard, and (2) Customs and Excise Officers may be excluded from the operation of the Order.L. N. GUILLEMARD.February 8, 19.17.PBINTBD AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY o. K. HARBISON. 9/3/1917.
