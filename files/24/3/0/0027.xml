[This Document is the Property .of Mis Britomc M^esty&apos;s foveramentj.&apos;THE duty laid upon the Shipping Controller by Act of Parliament is to control and regulate the available shipping in such a way as to ensure that it is employed to the best advantage, having regard to the circumstances of the time.The first necessity clearly is to secure and place at the disposal of the Government the ships required from time to time for the purpose of carrying on efficiently those services which are the direct and immediate responsibility of the Government, namely, all transport and supply, whether naval or military, the provision of all essential commodities, such as grain, sugar, meat, &amp;c, for civilian consumption which my from time to time be brought under control, and the due discharge of the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards their Allies. For this purpose suitable machinery already exists in the power of requisition as exercised by the Admiralty Transport Department, and to a limited extent by the Board of Trade, and the powers of prescribing employment of unrequisitioned vessels as now exercised by the Transport Department and by the Ship Licensing Committee, without whose authority and approval no British vessel can now load any cargo. Cumulatively these powers, whilst retaining the services of owners, constitute an elastic system of control over British ships, unrestricted both in scope and degree in so far as it is desirable to enforce it.Subject to the due fulfilment of the above direct and immediate responsibilities, it is submitted that the general control to be exercised over the shipping industry should be essentially a financial control, as in the case of railways and controlled establishments. .It is important, however, that the control should be such as to preserve the incentive of trade profit, which is the most powerful stimulus to efficiency. For this reason a development of the principle of .the excess profits tax (for which the necessary machinery is already in existence) is to be preferred to the application of the arrangement in force in, for example, controlled establishments, under which all profits beyond a fixed allowance are transferred to the Exchequer. Having.regard to the vital importance of a strong well-managed mercantile marine from the point of view of national safety, and to the special characteristics which differentiate it sharply from the industries above mentioned, all causes tending to a relaxation of effort (conscious or unconscious) on the part of those who alone can have the vast ramifications of the system fully within their grasp, should as far as possible be eliminated.If the policy indicated in this memorandum is adopted, the following advantages would be secured : 1. The ships required for direct Government service would be made available with the least possible dislocation of trade.2..The employment of ships in any way which is contrary to the national interest can be prevented either by restriction of imports of scheduled commodities, or under the Ship Licensing procedure.3. The advantages of cheap freights will be secured to the consumer in the case of commodities whose distribution has been brought under Government control. (It is only where such control has been established that the benefit of a saving of freight charges can under any system be secured to the general community. In the absence of such.control there is grave risk, amounting almost to a certainty, that any advantage accruing from favourable freight conditions will merely be transferred to the merchant or the foreign producer.)4. For the rest, the Government will secure to such an extent as may be deemed expedient the benefit of any exceptional profit incidental to the market conditions of the day.January 25, 1917.Printed for the War Cabinet.
