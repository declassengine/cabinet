Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET. G.-139.0WHEAT STOCKS IN UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Food Controller.I DESIRE to draw the immediate attention of the Cabinet to the position of wheat stocks, which are dangerously low, and if not immediately rectified will expose the country to great danger.   (Statement herewith.)The present stock of wheat and flour is about 6,000,000 quarters. It would be necessary, reckoning the consumption at normal (i.e., 600,000 quarters per week), to import 20,500,000 quarters so as to obtain a six months&apos; stock by the end of July. This represents an average weekly import of 231,000 tons, whereas the demand at present made to the Tonnage Priority Committee represents 127,000 tons per week. On this basis, therefore, we should require to import 104,000 tons per week additional, or about 450,000 tons per month.The most urgent need, at the earliest possible moment, is to bring wheat stocks up to at least thirteen weeks, i.e., three months&apos; supply, which was the position at the beginning of this year. The programme of the Wheat Commission at present provides for the following shipments to the United Kingdom during April and May: 	April.	May.	Tons.	Tons.North America	320,000	250,000Argentina   ..         ..	84,600	Australia	54.600	5,700The shipments arranged from North America are, in my opinion, hopelessly inadequate, and ought to be greatly increased.Tonnage should be found immediately, i.e., within the next two months, sufficient to ship all the wheat which has been, or can be, bought in the United States and Canada.   This supply, whatever it may be, should be secured at once.DEVQNPORT.March 26, 1917.
