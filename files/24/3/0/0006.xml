G.-106.THE  CONFERENCE   OF  THE   ALLIES   AT  ROME  ON JANUARY 5, 6, AND 7, 1917.Memorandum Circulated by the Prime Minister, to the Delegates. *THE Conference was summoned at the desire of the British Government, as we felt that, in the present situation, a very frank discussion was necessary, not only with reference to recent events in the Balkans and in Greece, but also in regard to the whole campaign of 1917.-2. We wish first to ask ihe permission of the Conference to speak with great frankness, and we invite the representatives of France and Italy to adopt the same course. In the last two and half vears the British and French representatives, owing to the comparative nearness of London mid Paris, have been able to meet on very frequent occasions. The result is that we have all got to know one another personally: by degrees formality has been overcome ; and at our most, recent Conferences we have been able to speak our full minds to one another without reserve, and without causing any friction or misunderstanding. Considerations of distance have unfortunately prevented us from having .such frequent meetings with the Italian representatives, but, in view of the traditional friendship between the British and Italian nations, and the racial affinity between the French and the Italians, we feel that we three nations, sitting together in council in this time of tremendous crisis, should speak to one another with the utmost freedom, and endeavour to secure the closest possible understanding. By such an understanding alone can we hope to secure that cordial co-operation which we believe to be essential to the winning of *the war.3. There is, indeed, nothing which the British Government have closer at heart than the concerting of such arrangements for co-operation between the Allies as will enable them to counteract the tremendous advantages which the enemy has obtained from a centralised control.4. The material and moral resources of the Allies are greatly in excess of those of the enemy. The Entente Powers have more men, more guns, greater resources, and the whole world to draw upon; and yet they have, up to the present, not been able to overcome their common enemy. What is the reason for this? It is that the German Emperor has secured complete control over the resources of all the Central Powers, and is able to use them wherever they can be most effectively employed, having regard to all the circumstances.5. During the year 1916, each of the armies of the Entente Powers has conducted a campaign with the utmost skill and courage. We have nothing but admiration for the manner in which each of the armies has fought. We believe, though, that each nation has concentrated its efforts too much upon its own front, with the result that the advantages which the Allies possess in personnel and resources have not been utilised to their maximum efficiency. Tne efforts of the British and French armies on the Western Front; of the Italian army on the Southern Front; and of the Russians in the East, though latterly co-ordinated in point of time, have not been sufficient to prevent an inferior enemy from overrunning, first Serbia, and latterly. Roumania. This is a serious reflection on our common efforts, and it behoves each Government to do its utmost to rectify the fundamental error.6 This, then, is the primary reason for which we have asked this Conference to assemble, namely, to examine whether some method can be found for focussing the efforts of the Allies in such a manner that, during the year 1917, the enemy can be crushed, and finally defeated.   In fact, we ask that the Conference shall now give* Nora.-A French translation was prepared for those Delegates not familiar with the English language.[173-3] &apos; B
expression and find some practical solution to the principle which was discussed at the Conference held in Paris on the 15th and 16th ISIovember last.7. Assuming, then, that the principle of complete and united co-operation is accepted-and we feel sure that the Governments represented here to-day are bound to accept it let us examine the present military situation, and seek how this piincinle can best b-^ applied.8. Unquestionably, the gravest problems confronting the Allies arise from tht collapse of Roumania. The Russians have had to extend their front in order that &quot;the Roumanian armies may re-form in rear before again coming into the line in full force. This, we fear, may exercise a far-reaching effect on the power of Russia for the offensive during the year 1917. The lack of heavy guns and ammunition which, in 1916, prevented Russia from developing her full strength, and which we had hoped to over-come by the add! inns to be made to the Russian ariuament during the next evv months, may, we fear, again hamper the offensive of our great Eastern Ally, since the additional heavy guns will, for defensive purposes, have to be spread over the greatly increased length of front.9. The Central Powers, we apprehend, may seek, if they think fit, to pursue their offensive far into the heart of Russia, either in the direction of Odessa or in the direction of Petrograd.Lu. Or, alternatively, the Central Powers may prefer, when they have established themselves on the shortest possihle defensive line in the East, to transfer a portion of their forces to attack the Allies at Salonica, and to overwhelm us in that theatre. According to our military advisers, the Allies, at their present strengih, should be able to maintain themselves against any attack which the enemy can bring again-t them in the Balkan theatre, but only by the evacuation of Monastir. The consequences of abandoning Monastir, however, are not agreeable to contemplate. It wid open the way for direct communication between the Central Powers and Greece, and may lead to the intervention, on the side of the enemy, of yet another Balkan State, a weak one, it is true, but not altogether negligible Moreover, the evacuation of Monastir will have a most depressing effect on the moral of the Serbian army, and it is to be feared that the troops composing this already dwindling force may become so discouraged as to desert the colours and scatter to their homes. In any case, the Serbian army has always shown itself superior in offence to &quot;defence. Thus, by withdrawing to a shorter line, the Allii-s run the risk not only of a further serious weakening, but possihly of an actual diminution of their forces in the Balkan theatre. Finally, withdrawal from Monastir, and the entry of the enemy into Greece, will inflict a moral blow on the cause of the Allies, which cannot fail to exercise a most unfortunate influence both on our own peoples and on neutral nations.11. There is yet another course which the Central Powers may adopt. They may turn the mass of their manoeuvre army upon the Italian Front, either before or after they have dealt with the Russians, or, alternatively, with the army of the East. Are we to look on as anxious but impotent spectators, whilst Germany destroys our friends one after another ?   This is our present position in reference zo Koumania.12. Now what, I ask, are the plans of the Allies for meeting any of&apos; these contin-gencies ? No doubt General Gourko, General Sarrail, and General Cadorna has each ah admirable plan of his own for meeting the contingency. But what is the plan of the Allies as a whole ? The combined offensive against Bulgaria, planned at Chantilly, is no longer practicable, and so far as we know the Allies have absolutely no plan, except for each General to continue &quot; punching &quot; on his own Front. We do not say that this course is negligible. Unquestionably, operations such as those undertaken on the Somme, or on the Carso, have some considerable effect in drawing in a part of the enemy&apos;s manoeuvre forces and in exhausting in rotation the troops that are put in to resist, but neb her of these operations availed to save Roumania. In modern war, it seems that the power of the defence, by first-rate and fully-equipped troops, is so considerable that great attacks can be held up by armies inferior numerically. Unquestionably, also, the enemy has shown very gieat powers of resistance on the defensive, and extraordinary skill in making the utmost out of, and improving, -artificially, such natural facilities as are offered by the terrain.13. We suggest that&apos; the Allied Generals should be asked by this Political Conference, to consider some more thorough measures of co-operation, and that the Governments should be prepared to give them tueir support.14. To give ,any direct, assistance to Russia, except by means of such material equipment as can be passed in through Archangel and Vladivostock is, we fear, impossible.   The extent to which material assistance can, and ought to be, given^to
Russia, having regard to the interests of the Allies as ^ a whole, is the primary rtonsideration to be examined at the forthcoming Conference in Russia. If the Russian Conference reports that, by increasing such equipment it is really possible in the year 1917 to put Russia in a position to exert an influence on the war commensurate with her numerical strength, then we think that the Western Allies should themselves be prepared to make sacrifices to render this possible. We are, however, not yet certain that this is tie case; we have an open miud on the subject. We think it possible that technical difficulties of communications by sea and by rail, lack of communications on the Russian front, the character of bridges, inadequate facilities for training personnel, and the strategic disadvantages of a greatly extended front already alluded to, may possibly be so serious in their cumulative effect as to prevent a full use being put to the  runs given to Russia. These, however, are matters primarily for the Russian Conference, and Twill not detain the present Conference with them further.15. With regard to the Balkans, the British and French Governments are in agreement, in principle, that:--&quot; The Allies should continue to hold Monastir and the line at present occupied, as long as this can be done without exposing the forces to defeat.   Meanwhile, a shorter line should be prepared for occupation, in case of need, which will enable ; the force to hold its own against any attack which may be made.&quot;To meet the danger to the Salonica force, the French Government have decided to send two divisions, and have invited the British Government to examine the possibility of sending two divisions.16. Practical considerations render it extremely difficult for us to comply with this request. The transport of troops from Great Britain to Salonica involves a long sea journey, and locks up shipping for considerable periods. Moreover, every increase of the army means an increase in the amount of shipping committed, for maintenance purposes, to this long aud dangerous line of communications. The increased intensity .of the enemy&apos;s submarine campaign makes this line of communication dangerous /throughout its length. For these reasons we are most unwilling to send any further force to Salonica, at a time when our Allies are making ever-increasing demands on *ur shipping resources for their essential needs in raw materials, coal, food supplies, and &quot;munitions. So serious is the shipping position, and so vital a factor is it upon the staying power of the Entente, that we will return to this qnestion later as a separate subject. In the meanwhile, we must ask the Conference to accept our view that after exhaustive examination we have come to the conclusion that the grave shipping situation provides an overwhelming argument against the despatch of farther British divisions to Salonica.17. These objections, however, do not apply to anything like the same degree in the case of Italy. The sea transit from Italy to the Balkan theatre of war is a com-paratively short one, and a considerable portion of the mute is well protected.18. We, therefore, urge most strongly that the Italian Government and military authorities should examine, in the most sympathetic spirit, the qnestion of principle of a considerable increase to their forres at Salonica. We wish to urge on them that this is desirable, not only in the interests of the Allies as a whole, but in those of Italy in particular. Any catastrophe to the Allied Army of the East would have a very serious repercussion upon Italy herself. It is possible that the next step the enemy-will take may be to concentrate upon Italy, and the less the influence of the Army of the East the greater will be the concentration of men and guns against Italy.19. Moreover, the penetration of the enemy into Greece, such as might occur if Monastir fell, would also affect Italy more seriously than any of the Allies, for the Greek ports would then become available as bases for enemy submarines against ltaly&apos;s sea-borne, communications. Thus, the security of the Allied Army of the East would appear to be a first-class Italian interest.20. Apart from the question of principle as to whether Italy can send further divisions to the Balkans, the examination of this problem involves two questions of detail.21. The first of these is whether Italian co-operation could be applied from the shores of the Adriatic. The French General Staff have suggested the possibility of the development of a route from Santi Quaranta to Monastir. If this is feasible it possesses considerable advantages, insomuch as it involves a very short sea route, which can be covered in a single night, and, therefore, involves not only the allocation of less shipping, hxit also less danger in the sea passage. It would also enable the Italian command to [173-SJ * B 2
exercise a direct control in a.definitely Italian sphere. I do not propose to discuss tins matter in any detail, as if is a Trench and not a &quot;British proposal, and M. Briand will; no doubt, prefer to explain the proposal himself. 1 would only observe that this would seem to be a question which we might remit for examination by the high military officers attending this Conference.22. The second question of detail is.another French proposal for a still greater development of the railway communications through Italy and Greece to Salonica for the passage of troops and, possiblv, at a later date, even of supplies and munitions for the Salonica array. It may be that the time has passed fur any general offensive by the Allies in the Balkans, but it is generally agreed that we cannot relinquish the position we at present hold in this theatre. In view of the increasing menace caused by enemy submarines, it would clearly be an advantage to the Allies to shorten the sea passage and the dependence of our Army of the East on shipping transport. Hence, we submit that this problem should be carefully examined and worked out, with a view to its future development on a great scale, as well as to its immediate possibilities. This, again, being a proposal of the French Government, I will leave it. to M. Br and to develop, observing once more that, it is a technical question that we might well remit for the consideration of our military advisers.23. Leaving the Balkans, let us look at the Italian Front. Here there are two possible contingencies : one defensive, the other offensive. If the enemy should, as suggested above, concentrate his manoeuvre armies against the Italian Front, it would afford a great opportunity for the Allies. Should the enemy adopt this course, the presumption is that he will gamble upon the stupidity and la^k of mobility of the Allies. Unquestionably, he regards us as stupid and lacking in initiative; we British most of all. Let us take advantage eftnis amiable belief. The enemy will base the plan of attack on the assumption that he has to meet a force of so many Italian heavy guns, some of which he knows to be of old type, and lacking in mobdity. If he elects to attack on this front, we propose that the Allies should concert their own plans, so thai instead of meeting the artillery armament that he calculates for, he shall find himself confronted with a vastly superior armament of Italian guns reinforced by British, and, we should hope, French heavy artillery, with iheir own personnel. The object of the Allies is to kill Germans. We can put them out of action just as well on the Italian as on the Western front. By adopting this plan we might well convert a repulse intoa rout, just as the Germans, by massing artillery on the Roumanian front, converted the Roumanian invasion ot Transylvania into an utter defeat. We ask our Albes to examine this proposal iii a,sympathetic spirit, and, subject to the approval of the Conference, we propose that orders should be given to our respective General Staffs to work it out in all its technical details, including the elaboration of railway time-tables, and the arrangements for the necessary gun emplacements and communications24. The second possible contingency is that the Allies themselves should take the offensive in this region. We consider that the instructions to the Allied staffs&apos; should not be limited to the provision of a ptirely defensive scheme for the Italian- front, as outlined above. We consider that they should be directed to examine also the possibilities of exploiting the offensive possibilities of this front. We should like to ask the Generals.to report to us whether they cannot devise plans for a surprise artillery concentration for offensive purposes on the Isonzo front. If our information is correct, the Itahan army has the strength to conduct offensive operations on a great scale on that relatively narrow fr nt, which is suited to a great offensive, and they have also the infantry strength to hoH a longer line than the present one. We understand that the reason why they have.not yet achieved complete success in their splendid offensive is the lack of sufficient artillery, and, more especially, heavy artillery and heavy artillery ammunition, to bring about a decisive conclusion. Would it not be possible to make a great and sudden stroke against the enemy by a concentration of British and French artillery on the Isouzo front, so as not only to ensure the safety of Italy against any enemy concentration, but, what is more important, to shatter the enemy&apos;s forces, to inflict a decisive defeat on him, and to press forward to Trieste aud to get astride the lsiriau Peninsula ?25. The strategical advantages to be gained by such action appear to he very-great. It would probably be a great surpiise to the enemy. The action would be fought on enemy territory. It would enable the Italians to deploy their full strength. It would compel the euenvy to defend a longer line. It should, therefore, have an immediate effect in relieving the Russian, Roumanian, and Balkan fronts. It might enanlc the Allies to attack Pola, and probably either to destroy the Austrian fleet, or to force it to action, or drive it out to become a prey to our submarines.   This in turn
should hamper the enemy&apos;s submarine campaign in the Mediterranean. Moreover, it could be accomplished without any additional strain whatsoever upon our shipping. It would have a moral and political effect of the greatest consequence, and would be a good counter to the enemy&apos;s successes in Roumania. It would enable the Allies to take advantage of a period when the weather on the Western Front is unfavourable to the development of a great offensive. It would, however, be absolutely necessary to have a clear understanding that, within a certain period of time, the heavy guns should be withdrawn to enable the British and French armies to pursue their offensive on the Western Front.26. Such, then, are the problems which we think the Governments and the General Staffs should consider, namely: (1.) The desirability of sending guns to Russia, even at a sacrifice, by the Western Powers. This, however, is a matter on which we must await the report of the Conference in Russia.(2.) The desirability of the despatch of two Italian divisions to the Balkan theatre  either through Santi Quaranta or Salonica; in this connection also the development of railway communications through Italy and Greece should be examined.(3.) The development of defensive and offensive schemes of co-operation on the Italian Front.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BT C. R. HARBISON. 1/2/1917.
