Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1917.SECRET.G.-128.S 5    25PROPAGANDA-A DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.Memorandum by Mr. John Buchan.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-101, G.-102, and G.-103.)In this memorandum questions of policy are not touched upon, as they have been fully dealt with in Mr. Donald&apos;s report. Nor does it enter into detail with regard to the ^working of the suggested branches. Its object is to sketch the machinery which, in the opinion of the writer, if properly worked, would carry out the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and get rid of the defects which have hiithprto been conspicuous in our publicity and propaganda work.I. A Department of Information.The first essential is that the whole work of publicity and propaganda should be centralised in one Department under a responsible director. At present the work is done by the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the War Office, and to some small extent by the Home Office.The new Department should be directly under the Prime Minister.It would have two main functions propaganda, or the putting of the Allied case in neutral countries, and the explanation of the British effort in Allied countries, with the object of ensuring a wholesome state of public opinion; and, at the same time, the direction of&apos; British opinion when direction is needed.It is not suggested that there should be any attempt to spoon-feed the British press. Newspapers, as before, will be free to enter into direct relations with the different Government Departments. But the War Cabinet may desire to give a lead to British opinion, either by the confidential disclosure beforehand to responsible editors of some line of policy or coming event, or by the publication of some statement or other. This would naturally be done through the Department of Information.IT. The Director.To ensure efficient control it is necessary (a) that the Director of Information should have a completely free hand as to personnel and (6) that he should operate upon funds from which payments could be made without unnecessary delays. In all propaganda time is of vital importance.(a.) In the several existing Departments which deal with propaganda there are a large number of able men who have done admirable words. Many of them are in the wrong positions, and the work of all has suffered from the lack of central direction. I am confident that the bulk of this personnel could be u?ed in the new Department, and that the staffing of it would be no serious difficulty. The nucleus of a very competent staff exisis both at home and abroad, and it Mill not be hard to get bold of suitable people for new developments. A certain amount of surplusage can be dispensed with, and there must be a general revision of salaries, which in some cases are too high. In my opinion the number of jjeople employed in the new Department of Information need not be much larger than the number formerly employed, and the total cost of salaries might be less.(b.) With regard to finance, so far as possible I think it desirable that the Depart-ment should operate on Secret Service funds. At present there is a good deal of confusion in financial arrangements, and it will be necessary to have a competent financial controller.
With regard to the Director himself, it is desirable that be should be a civilian at home and have military rank during his&apos; visits to France. He will have to keep pretty closei v in touch with General Headquarters, and make frequent visits to the Continent, and for this military rank will be a very real advantage. There is no reason why that rank should be high, but it might be well if he were made a Staff officer. I understand that General Headquarters would have no objection to some such arrangement.III. An Advisory Committee.It is desirable that the Director should be assisted at any rate at the start-by a small Advisory Committee of men who are experts in publicity work. This Committee would have no executive functions. I suggest that it might be composed of four representative British editors or newspaper proprietors, and perhaps the manager of Reuters.IV.The attached diagram will show the proposed organisation of the Department. I attach notes on the various branches.DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.

(r.) Financial Secretary.The Liaison Officers. These are very important in. order to keep the Director in touch with the different Government Departments which propaganda concerns. It is vital that no propaganda should be in conflict with the views of the Foreign Office, the War Office, or the Admiralty, and the Liaison Officers must possess the complete confidence both of the Director of Information and the Office to which they are attached. Take the case of the Foreign Office. Constant questions are turning up daily with regard to the blockade, or war trade, or events abroad, on which foreign newspaper correspondents are anxious for information, and this can only be got from the branches of the Foreign Office concerned. In the same way these correspondents seek informa-tion from War Office and Admiralty officials on military and naval points. It would be the duty of the Liaison Officers to facilitate the relations between their Departments and the Department of Information, and to keep the Director in touch with all new developments of departmental policy. The Liaison Officer with General Head-quarters would be in a different position. He would really act as a censor on behalf of General Headquarters (who are the only authorities who can conduct a proper military censorship), and would hold a watching brief for them. To avoid constant delays in reference, it would be his task to advise whether any propaganda matter ought to be referred to General Headquarters or not. He must have experience of work at General Headquarters, and be thoroughly familiar with the situation on the fighting fronts. He would not himself, of course, have the power of censoring.Of the eighteen sub-departments eight represent special functions and ten geographical areas.(a.) (Jables and Wireless. This is perhaps the most important branch of all, and at present, though a great deal of work is done, a great deal is done badly. There is delay in sending messages, and much unsuitable matter is cabled. It is important to bring the whole work of wireless, cabling, and telephoning into one sub-department to
save time and prevent overlapping. The telephone might be far more used in connection with the nearer Continental countries, &quot;and close connection should be maintained with the representatives of the Maison de la Presse in London. I am convinced that the offices of the sub-department should be in Fleet Street in order that it may be in close contact with the great newspapers and with Reuters.(b.) Literature. This sub-department will dead with all publications, books, pamphlets, and magazines which are issued in English and other languages1 in the British and Allied interest. Hitherto this has been the staple of the -whole propaganda business, and I am afraid it has been considerably over-done-and a great deal of money-spent unnecessarily. It is a vital branch, but less important now than at the beginning of the war. Much greater care- must be taken as to the suitability of the matter issuediThe sub-department should&apos; also, in my opinion, endeavour to further the distri-butionin neutral and Allied countries of British books not of a propagandist character. At present the German, owing to his superior trade arrangements, has a practical monopoly, even in branches where works in English are the better article. As a publisher with a large international business, I am convinced that, with a little trouble, this ring can be broken.(c.) Photographs and Pictures: This sub-department would deal with the large mass of official photographs and their distribution, and also with the work of artists, of whom we a^e now sending, out considerable numbers to the fronts.. (d.) Cinema Films. This matter has been greatly bungled in the past, and many foolish contracts have been made. Even now it is subject to two . quite different authorities. The sub-department should be managed by a small expert Committee under the Director, for no branch of propaganda has greater possibilities before it.(e.) Visits and Entertainments. On the whole this work has been well done. The sub-department would concern itself with the visits.of journalists and others from Allied and neutral countries to.Britain and to the fleets and the front, and with the visits of British journalists or public men to Allied and neutral countries. It should also concern itself with getting facilities for Allies and neutrals to see representative-public men here. The modest hospitality which is possible in time of war would also come within its province.    ,(/, g, h, i, j, k, I, m, n, o.). These sub-departments will have the care of propaganda within their areas. Each will be in charge of a man who is an expert in the particular subject. It will be their business, by means of representatives and. correspondents, to follow very closely the currents of feeling in the different countries, and to decide what is the wisest form of propaganda in each. For example, the sub-department dealing with France will have a general oversight of all cables to France, of all propagandist literature, pictures, photographs, and cinemas circulating there, of all visits of Frenchmen here and of Englishmen to France; and will also act as an intelligence bureau to acquire information about popular feeling in the different French districts. Each sub-department will represent the expert knowledge available as to the particular country, and will consult and be consulted by the special departments such as Literature, Cables, Cinemas, &amp;c, on all matters concerned with its province. In almost every case a considerable expert staff is available for these geographical departments.(p..) Enemy Propaganda. This sub-department will follow closely the German press^ and wireless, German publications, the speeches of German statesmen and the activities of German agents abroad in order that enemy propaganda may be promptly met. It will not be, so to speak, a court of first enquiry, like the Intelligence Depart-ment o\&apos; the Admiralty and the War Office, but will use the results arrived at by the Intelligence Departments with a special eye to counter-propaganda.(q.) The Record Department, It will be the business of this sub-department to test the effectiveness of the propaganda It will keep a record of the activities of all the other^sub-departments, and will check them by receiving reports on the results of propaganda in the different areas. Some such organisation is necessary to prevent lines of activity being followed which primd facie promise well, but which in practice do not yield adequate results.There is one special branch which ought naturally to belong to the Department of Information. An enormous amount of work is being done at present in1 translating from enemy newspapers. The War Office, the Board of Trade, and the Foreign Office all prepare digests, and undoubtedly there is a great deal of over-lapping: These digests are well done on the whole, and to bring this work at present under the Department of Information would, I think, impose too heavy a strain upon a new department,   I would
suggest that for the present these digests go on as before, but that the special American digest, which Mr. Masterman&apos;s office has hitherto prepared, should be transferred to the American sub-section of the Department of Information.(?&apos;) The Financial Secretary. This needs no comment.Logically the Press Bureau should also be a branch of the Department of Information. It has two tasks one distributive, and one restrictive. The second, the Censorship, might well be improved, for at present it bristles with sins of omission and commission ; but to bring the Censorship under this Department at this stage would be a very difficult task. As to the distributive side the issue of official com-mxmiqu.es there is less difficulty, but at present the Press Bureau have a machinery of telephones and messengers which it would be troublesome to duplicate. I suggest that the whole question of the Press Bureau be left over for the present.Y. The Housing of the Department.At present the work is done in some rooms on the top floor of the Foreign Office, part of the National Insurance Office at Wellington House, in some rooms at 82, Victoria Street, and in the Press Bureau, War Office, and Admiralty. Two plans are possible with regard to the housing of the new Department: (a.) To keep the existing stalls where they are and to find three or four rooms for the Director and, perhaps, a couple of sub-departments not too far away from Whitehall;(6.) To get hold of some building to enable the whole Department to live under one roof.a has the advantage that it would save a little time and a considerable amount of money and fuss. I am afraid, however, that it might lead the public to believe that the old organisation was still going on, and, in particular, that the Department of Information was still a branch of the Foreign Office. If it is at all practicable, it might be wiser to clear the Department out of the Foreign Office altogether, as also out of the War Office and Admiralty. There is no reason why one or two of the sub-departments should not be stdl located at Wellington House and at 82, Victoria Street. It will be necessary to domicile the Cabling department at Fleet Street, where rooms can be easily got. For the rest, the Director and the principal sub-departments should be established not too far away from Whitehall, so as to be fairly near the Foreign Office, the War Office, and the Admiralty. If a portion not more than half a dozen rooms of the Royal Automobile Club could be obtained it would be an admirable arrangement.JOHN BUCHAN.February 3, 1917.o
