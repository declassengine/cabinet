SECRET.FOURTH REPORT.THE General Act of the Conference of Berlin, signed on the 26th February, 1885, was an international agreement, the object of. which was the development of trade and civilisation in certain regions of Equatorial Africa and the furthering of the moral and material well being of the natives. With this object in view, the xAct prescribed that, within a specified zone, termed the Conventional Basin of the Congo, there should be absolute freedom of commerce and navigation for all nations, to the exclusion of any protective or preferential tariffs. It also provided, under certain conditions, and with the consent of the Powers concerned, for the permanent neutrality of the territories within that zone, even in the event of the Powers, whose territories lay within it, being engaged in war (see Appendix (A)).2. The Act was, in fact, not so much an ordinary treaty as a commercial and humanitarian convention, which those who framed it intended to be a permanent part of international law, which should be unaffected by such transitory phenomena as the possible outbreak of war between the signatories. Participation in its benefits purported not to be confined to the Signatory Powers, but to be conferred upon mankind at large. There was no provision for its denunciation. Article 4, however, stated that, after the lapse of twenty years, the Powers reserved to themselves to determine whether the freedom of import prescribed in article 1 should be retained or not. Article 36 further laid down in more general terms that modifications and improvements in the General Act might be introduced by common consent.3. The commercial and economic provisions of the Berlin Act were extended and modified by the Brussels Declaratirm of the 2nd July, 1890 (Appendix (B)). The complete freedom of import, in particular, having been found incompatible with revenue necessities, was abandoned in the Conventional Basin of- the Congo for a non-differential customs system with a maximum rate of 10 per cent, ad valorem. The necessity of special fiscal treatment in the case, of the importation of spirituous liquors and of arms and ammunition was recognised, and the sanction of the Signatory Powers was given for such treatment in the Declaration of the 2nd July, 1890 (spirits) and in the further declaration signed at Brussels on the 15th June, 1910 (arms and ammunition). - In the Eastern zone, which included Italian, British, and German East Africa, the rate was fixed bv agreement between the three Powers concerned at 5 per cent, ad valorem, with a rate of 10 per cent, for arms and ammunition (Appendix (C)).   This agreement expired in 1902.4 The international character of the zone covered by the Berlin Act was still further modified in the course of the next twenty years. The system of concessions introduced into the Congo Free State by King Leopold of Belgium was entirely contrary to the spirit of the Act, not only in its disregard for the rights of the natives, but in its practical abrogation over an immense area of the system of free and equal trade for the sake of which the Free State was founded. The attempts made to induce the Signatory Powers to intervene in order to rectify this state of affairs only led to the realisation of the unsatisfactory character of an international State, and to the conclusion that the best prospect of good government lay in the transfer of the Congo Free State to the direct sovereignty of Belgium. This transfer was carried out in 1908. . .5. Elsewhere, too, in the zone the occupying Powers, though refraining from the direct imposition of differential import duties, tended to assimilate their regime more and more to that of their other colonies.   Germany, for instance, by a combination of through rates on her railways and subsidised steamers with special financial facilities [502]
effectively retained the trade of German East Africa in her own hands, and at one time imposed a prohibitive export duty on sisal bulbilles in order to prevent a competing sisal industry from being started in British East Africa.6. How far, indeed, the ideal which the framers of the Berlin Act intended to establish had ceased to be compatible with the actual facts of the situation in 1914 became evident on the outbreak of hostilities. The wireless stations established in the German colonies were an essential part of their whole world-wide scheme for raiding our commerce and protecting their own, and the destruction of these stations wras consequently at once laid down as one of the most immediately urgent objectives of naval and military operations overseas. The wireless station at Dar-es-Salaarn was, in fact, destroyed by a British naval force on 8th August, 1914. It was at the same time reported from Zanzibar that the Germans in German East Africa contemplated immediate active operations, and had moved Government headquarters inland. On the 12th August, 1914, it was announced that a German expedition was invading British Nyasaland.7. In a note of the 9th August, 1914, indeed, the Belgian Minister in London stated that the Governor-General of the Congo had been instructed not to take offensive action against the German colonies, and asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view to limiting the area of hostilities, would take advantage of article 11 of the Berlin Act to declare the neutrality of those British colonies in the Conventional Basin of the Congo. In view of the operations which had already taken place, His Majesty&apos;s Government did not consider that they could support this proposal.8. The Erench Government had meanwhile received a similar request, and were at first inclined to agree with it. They were willing to neutralise their possessions in the Conventional Basin on condition that Germany would do likewise, and asked the Spanish Government to approach the Germans in that sense. They also expressed the hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would take a similar course. A few days later, however, the Erench Ambassador communicated a telegram from Paris, dated the 12th August, stating that, in view of the menacing attitude of the Germans, who were evidently contemplating an attack on the Erench Congo, it was not possible to propose the neutralisation of their territory in the Congo.9. It was not until the 24th September that the United States Embassy transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government, without comment, the information that the German Government had on the 22nd August told the United States Ambassador in Berlin that they were willing to agree to neutralisation of the free-trade zone as contemplated jn chapter III, article 11, of the Berlin Act.10. On the 14th October, 1914, the Erench and Belgian Governments wrere invited to agree to a reply to the United States Government that &quot; such a proposal would not now be practicable in view of the hostilities that have already taken place on both sides, which include attacks made by German forces on British East Africa, British Central Africa, and Albertville.&quot; Both Governments agreed, and the note to the United States Ambassador was despatched on the 20th November, 1914.11. It is clear from the above facts that, while the stipulations of the Berlin Act with regard to neutrality were under consideration of the belligerents, the circum-stances wrere such that no serious effort was made by either side to secure their observance, and no serious protest raised against their non-observance. None of the neutral signatories to the Act made any attempt to fulfil the duty imposed on them by article 11 of independently approaching the belligerents with this object in view. In the opinion of the Committee this tacit admission, on the part of neutrals, Gf the change that had taken place in the situation since 1885, as far as their obligations were concerned, is not without its bearing on any right which they may claim at a later stage that the economic system laid down in the Act should be maintained unaltered for their benefit.12. At the Economic Conference of the Allies held at Paris in June 1916, it was agreed, on the proposition of the Belgian delegates, to insert a declaration in the proces-verbal, stating that the articles of the Berlin Act, relative to commerce and navigation, were no longer of effect (ont pris fin) as far as enemy countries were concerned.   This was not a legal opinion, hut&apos; a statement of the intention of the
Allied Powers, at that time in occupation, of most of the area concerned, to refuse to &quot;-rant the economic privileges of the Act to the Central Powers after. ,the war. As,bhowever, this declaration has not been published, the non-belligerent signatories of &apos;the Act have not yet had an opportunity of defining their attitude in regard to this further alteration in the international character and permanence of the Act,13. Tire present status of multilateral treaties among signatories, some of whom have been the belligerents in the present war, has been submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown, who have expressed the opinion that it is substantially, though not completely, accurate to say that every multilateral treaty is in effect a set of bilateral arrangements fashioned into one whole for general convenience, and that it can therefore be annulled as between belligerents provided this can be done without impairing the rights and obligations subsisting between other parties. They point out. for example, that the international instrument which guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium could hardly have been annulled as between Prance and Germany after the war of 1870 without a violation of the rights of Great Britain. (Appendix (D) and (E).)14. If the Berlin Act, with its subsequent modifications, is to be regarded as an ordinary multilateral treaty, then in so far as the Central Powers are not only beneficiaries under it, but also under a general obligation to maintain its provisions, their elimination might, on the above analogy, presumably be objected to by neutrals as an impairment of their rights. It is also conceivable that it might be contended that the complete freedom of trade guaranteed to Holland or Sweden under the Act was diminished if there were any restriction upon the liberty of Dutch or Swedish merchants to sell German goods in the Belgian Congo (Article 3). It would be possible, in fact, on a strictly legal construction, to argue that the Allies are not only bound, to observe the economic provisions of the Act in regard to neutrals, unless they can secure their modification by individual negotiations, but are also under an obligation to neutrals to maintain, the rights and obligations of the Central Powers as signatories to the Act, until the Act itself is superseded by a general European conference of the same character as those which established it.15. The Committee desire, however, to suggest that His Majesty !s Government have the right and duty to regard the Act, not only from the narrow point of view of its legal construction as an ordinary treaty, but also from that of its original purpose and subsequent history as set forth in the earlier paragraphs of the present report. Prom this point of view it might reasonably be urged that the whole international system set up in the Act had largely been superseded by developments before the present war, and that the disregard during the wrar of the provisions relating to neutrality, without serious protest either by belligerents or by neutrals, afforded clear evidence of the fact that they had ceased to be really effective. On that assumption it would be a question not of treaty obligation, but purely of policy on the part of the Allies, in consultation with each other, to consider how far consideration should be given to the equitable claims of neutrals with reference to the trade in Allied territories in Equatorial Africa. Itnvould similarly be for the Allies to settle among themselves what form should be given to the notification to be made^to neutrals of the decision, arrived at and of its justification.16. It would further be a matter for consultation between the Allies, or more particularly those Allies who. are directly concerned, as the actual occupants of the Equatorial territories in question, how far they would wish to be bound any longer, even as regards each other, by the economic stipulations of the Act, with or without modification. It is not improbable that Erance, and possibly Belgium, will be anxious to secure for themselves the liberty to give preference in their possessions not only to Allies and neutrals over Germans and Austrians, but also to their own nationals and products over those of Allies and neutrals. . It remains for the British Government to decide, on a consideration of the economic interests of the British Empire as a whole, whether it will endeavour to maintain the provisions of the existing Acts as between Allies and neutrals, or to substitute a modified form of those provisions, or to aim at securing complete freedom from all the restrictions imposed by the Acts on their economic sovereignty in such British possessions, present or prospective, as are situated within the area covered by the Acts.17. A decision on this question cannot, in the opinion of the Committee, be separated from the wider question of the general economic policy of the British [502] * C
Empire. If the future economic policy of the British Empire is to be one of internal development and mutual economic preference, not only, as regards the self-governing Dominions, hilt also as regards British possessions and protectorates generally, then it may be in the British interest to secure such liberty of action against Allies and neutrals, as well as against enemy Powers, as will enable the policy adopted to be carried out in the British Possessions in Equatorial Africa. Here , again, it will depend on a careful examination of the economic situation, whether it is preferable, in British interests, to aim at such a complete liberty of action on our part as would also involve, on the part of Erance and Belgium, the possibility of very high discriminatory tariffs against our trade, or to endeavour to secure by negotiation a new economic agreement for a system of low tariffs throughout the region in question, with limited preference to the products of the territorial sovereign power. Such a solution, while not inconsistent with a moderate measure of preference to British trade on British territory, would still secure for British trade access on reasonable terms to the Equatorial possessions of our Allies.18. The latter policy would naturally involve less dislocation of existing British trade interests both in the French and in the Belgian Congo. It would also afford reasonable consideration to the equitable vested interests of neutrals who mi^ht he severely injured by a complete change of the economic system in these regions to one of high tariffs, but would not be seriously or immediately affected by trifling increases, even if they were accompanied by preferential remissions for the trade of nationals. On broad grounds of general policy the Committee consider that it would be undesirable that the great extensions of Allied colonial territory, which may result from the present war, should be accompanied by economic measures which would involve injustice to neutrals. They recommend, therefore, that if the general economic policy of the British Empire in future is to be based on the principle of preferential trade, His Majesty&apos;s Government should aim at the establishment, in consultation with the Allies, of an economic system in the regions hitherto subject to the provisions of the Berlin Act, which, while not inconsistent with that principle, should at the same time afford a large scope to the commerce and enterprise of other nations.19. In this connection the attention of the Committee has been called to the Anglo-French Agreement of 1898 by which a non-preferential system has been established over a large zone of West Africa outside of the Conventional Basin of the Congo, as defined in the Berlin Act, embracing the French possessions of the Ivory Coast, Dahomey and part of the French Soudan, and the British colonies of the Gold Coast and Nigeria, The effect of the Convention has been undoubtedly beneficial to British trade in the French colonies concerned. Here, again, it will depend on the general economic policy of the British Empire whether the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be to allow the agreement to run its course till 1929, when it normally expires, or to secure by negotiation with France a revision which will assimilate the economic system in this area to that which may be agreed upon for the zone covered by the Berlin Act.20. With regard to the humanitarian objects of the Berlin and Brussels Acts, we are strongly of opinion that the time has come when it should be laid down as a guiding principle for further action that the only Powers reasonably entitled to a voice in arrangements for the welfare of African natives are those which have territories in the African continent.21. In view of the danger which is now known to have resulted from the unre-stricted admission of German missionaries to British oversea possessions, we consider that it is of the first importance that the provisions of article 6 of the Berlin Act and article 2 of the Brussels Act should be so modified as to allow His Majesty&apos;s Government full liberty alter the war to deal with missions and missionaries.22. We also consider that the provisions relating to the navigation of the Niger in Chapter V of the Berlin Act are in many respects obsolete, and.that in any future revision of the Act they should be omitted. Such omissions will not affect the facilities for transit on the Niger and its tributary the Benue, which the French will no doubt desire to maintain, as these facilities have been fully provided for by the law of Nigeria, which will, of course, remain in force.   It is assumed that it will not be
necessary&quot; to renew the agreement with Germany respecting boundaries in Africa of the loth November, 1893, but, in the contrary event, it is desirable that article 6 of that agreement, which re-enacts the provisions of Chapter Y of the Berlin Act, referred to above, should be omitted.23. A memorandum by the Board of Trade on British trade interest in the German oversea possessions is printed as Appendix (F). This is the one referred to in paragraph 15 of the Second Interim Report.24 The views of the Air Board, furnished in response to paragraph 48 of the Third Interim Report, on the necessity for securing suitable seaplane and airship bases and aerodromes, and for safeguarding flying rights in any scheme of territorial readjustment, are given in Appendix (G).25. In concluding the fourth and last report, we desire to express our thanks to Major Storr for the valuable assistance which we have received from him throughout the enquiry, and our great indebtedness to the ungrudging labours and the unfailing resource and energy of Captain Amery, M.P., in his capacity of Secretary to the Committee.(Signed) LOUIS MALLET (Chairman).W.

(Here follow names.)f * *Who, being provided with full powers, which have been found in good and due form, have successively discussed and adopted : 1. A Declaration relative to freedom of trade in the basin .of the Congo, its embouchures and circumjacent regions, with other provisions connected therewith.&apos;2. A Declaration relative to the Slave Trade, and the operations by sea or land which furnish slaves to that trade.3. A Declaration relative to the neutrality of the territories comprised in the Conventional basin of the Congo.4. An Act of Navigation for the Congo, which, while having regard to local circumstances, extends to this river, its affluents, and the waters in its system (&quot; eaux qui leur sont assimilees &quot;), the general principles enunciated in Articles CVIII and CXVI of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, and intended to regulate, as between the Signatory Powers of that Act, the free navigation of the waterways separating or traversing several States these said principles having since then been applied by agreement to certain rivers.of Europe and America, but especially to the Danube, with the modifications stipulated by the Treaties of Paris (1856), of Berlin (1878), and of London (1871 and 1883).5. An Act of Navigation for the Niger, which, while likewise having regard to local circumstances, extends to this river and its affluents the same principles as set forth in Articles CVIII and CXVI of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna.6. A Declaration introducing into international relations certain uniform rules with reference to future occupations on the coast of the African Continent.And deeming it expedient that all these several documents should be combined in one single instrument, they (the Signatory Powers) have collected them into one General Act, composed of the following Articles : Chapter I. Declaration relative to Freedom of Trade in the Basin of the Congo, its Mouths and circumjacent Regions, with other Provisions connected therewith.Article 1.The trade of all nations shall enjoy complete freedom 1. In all the regions forming the basin of the Congo and its outlets. This basin is bounded by the watersheds (or mountain ridges) of the adjacent basins, namely, in particular, those of the Niari, the Ogowe, the Schari, and the Nile, on the north; by the
eastern watershed line of the affluents of Lake Tanganyika on the east; and by the watersheds of the basins of the Zambesi and the Loge on&apos; the south. It therefore comprises all the regions watered by the Congo and its affluents, including Lake Tanganyika, with its eastern tributaries.2. In the maritime zone extending along the Atlantic Ocean from the parallel situated in 20 30&apos; of south latitude to the mouth of the Loge.The northern boundary will follow the parallel situated in 2G 30&apos; from the coast to the point where it meets the geographical basin of the Congo, avoiding the basin of the Ogowe, to which the provisions of the present Act do not apply.The southern boundary will follow the course of the Loge to its source, and thence pass eastwards till it joins the geographical basin of the Congo.3. In the zone stretching eastwards from the Congo Basin as above defined, to the Indian Ocean from 5 degrees of north latitude to the mouth of the Zambesi in the south, from which point the line of demarcation will ascend the Zambesi to 5 miles above its confluence with the Shire, and then follow the watershed between the affluents of Lake Nyassa and those of the Zambesi, till at last it reaches the watershed between the waters of the Zambesi and the Congo.* a- -s- *- * *Article 2.All flags, without distinction of nationality, shall have free access to the whole of the coast-line of the territories above enumerated, to the rivers there running into the sea to all the waters of the Congo and its affluents, including the lakes, and to all the ports situate on the banks of these waters, as well as to all canals which may in future be constructed with intent to unite the watercourses or lakes within the entire area of the territories described in Article 1. Those trading under such flags niay engage in all sorts of transport, and carry on the coasting trade by sea and river, as well as boat traffic, on the same footing as if they were subjects.Article 3.Wares, of whatever origin, imported into these regions, under whatsoever flag, by sea or river, or overland, shall be subject to no other taxes than such as may be levied as fair compensation for expenditure in the interests of trade, and which for this reason must be equally borne by the subjects themselves and by foreigners of all nationalities. All differential dues on vessels, as well as on merchandise, are forbidden.Article 4.Merchandise imported into these regions shall remain free from import and transitdues.The Powers reserve to themselves to determine after the lapse of twenty years whether this freedom of import shall be retained or not. &apos;Article 5.No Power which exercises or shall exercise sovereign rights in the above-mentioned regions shall be allowed to grant therein a monopoly or favour of any kind in matters of trade.Foreigners, without distinction, shall enjoy protection of their persons and property, as well as the right of acquiring and transferring movable and immovable possessions; and national rights and treatment in the exercise of their professions.* &apos; * * * , . * &apos;Chapter III. Declaration relative to the Neutrality of the Territories comprised inthe Conventional Basin of the Congo.Article 10.In order to give a new guarantee of security to trade and industry, and to encourage, by the maintenance of peace, the development of civilisation in the countries mentioned m Article 1, and placed under the free trade system, the High Signatory Parties to the [502] D
present Act, and those who shall hereafter adopt it, bind themselves to respect the neutrality of the territories, or portions of territories, belonging to the said countries, comprising therein the territorial waters, so long as the Powers which exercise or shall exercise the rights of sovereignty or Protectorate over those territories, using their option of proclaiming themselves neutral, shall fulfil the duties which neutrality requires.Article 11.In case a Power exercising rights of sovereignty or Protectorate in the countries mentioned in Article 1, and placed under the free trade system, shall be involved in a war, then the High Signatory Parties to the present Act, and those who shall hereafter adopt it, bind themselves to lend their good offices in order that the territories belonging to this Power and comprised in the conventional free trade zone shall, by the common consent of this Power and of the other belligerent or belligerents, be placed during the war under the rule of neutrality, and considered as belonging to a non-belligerent State, the belligerents thenceforth abstaining from extending hostilities to the territories thus neutralised, and from using them as a base for warlike operations.* * * * *Chapter IV. Act of Navigation for the Congo. Article 13.The navigation of the Congo, without excepting any of its branches or outlets is, and shall remain, free for the merchant-ships of all nations equally, whether carrying-cargo or ballast, for the transport of goods or passengers. It shall be regulated by the provisions of this Act of Navigation, and by the Rules to be made in pursuance thereof.In the exercise of this navigation the subjects and flags of all nations shall in all respects be treated on a footing of perfect equality, not only for the direct navigation from the open sea to the inland ports of the Congo and vice versa, but also for the great and small coasting trade, and for boat traffic on the course of the river.Consequently, on all the course and mouths of the Congo there will be no distinction made between the subjects of Riverain States and those of non-Riverain States, and no exclusive privilege of navigation will be conceded to Companies, Corporations, or private persons whatsoever.These provisions are recognized by the Signatory Powers as becoming henceforth a part of international law.iv * * &quot; * - * *Article 25.The provisions of the present Act of Navigation shall remain in force in time of war. Consequently all nations, whether neutral or belligerent, shall be always free, for the purposes of trade, to navigate the Congo, its branches, affluents, and mouths, as well as the territorial waters fronting the embouchure of the river.Traffic will similarly remain free, despite a state of war, on the roads, railways, lakes, and canals mentioned in Articles 15 and 16.There will be no exception to this principle, except in so far as concerns the trans-port of articles intended for a belligerent, and in virtue of the law of nations regarded as contraband of war.All the works and establishments created in pursuance of the present Act, especially the tax-collecting offices and their treasuries, as well as the permanent service staff of these establishments, shall enjoy the benefits of neutrality (&quot; places sous le regime de la neutralite &quot;), and shall, therefore, be respected and protected by belligerents.Chapter V. Act of Navigation for the Niger Article 26.The navigation of the Niger, without excepting any of its branches and outlets, is and shall remain entirely free for the merchant-ships of all nations equally, whether with cargo or ballast, for the transportation of goods and passengers. It shall be regulated by the provisions of this Act of Navigation, and by the rules to be made in pursuance of this Act.
In the exercise of this navigation the subjects and flags of all nations shall be treated, in all circumstances, on a footing of perfect equality, not only for the direct navigation from the open sea to the inland ports of the Niger, and vice versa, but for the great and small coasting trade, and for boat trade on the course of the river.Consequently, on all the course and mouths of the Niger there will be no distinction made between the subjects of the Riverain States and those of non-Riverain States ; and no exclusive privilege of navigation will be conceded to Companies, Corporations, or private persons.These provisions are recognised by the Signatory Powers as forming henceforth a part of international law.* * * * *Article 33.The arrangements of the present Act of Navigation will remain in force in time of war. Consequently, the navigation of all neutral or belligerent nations will be in all time free for the usages of commerce on the Niger, its branches, its affluents, its mouths, and outlets, as well as on the territorial waters opposite the mouths and outlets of that river.The traffic will remain equally free in spite of a state of war on the roads, railways, and canals mentioned in Article 29.There will be an exception to this principle only in that which relates to the transport of articles destined for a belligerent, and considered, in virtue of the law of nations, as articles of contraband of war.Chapter VI. Declaration relative to the essential Conditions to be observed in order that new Occupations on the Coasts of the African Continent may be held to be effective.Article 34.Any Power which henceforth takes possession of a tract of land on the coasts of the African Continent outside of its present possessions, or which, being hitherto without such possessions, shall acquire them, as well as the Power which assumes a Protectorate there, shall accompany the respective act with a notification thereof, addressed to the other Signatory Powers of the present Act, in order to enable them, if need be, to make good any claims of their own.Article 35.The Signatory Powers of the present Act recognise the obligation to ensure the establishment of authority in the regions occupied by them on the coasts of the African Continent sufficient to protect existing rights, and, as the case may be, freedom of trade and of transit under the conditions agreed upon.Chapter VII.-General Dispositions. Article 36.The Signatory Powers of the present General Act reserve to themselves to introduce into it subsequently, and by common accord, such modifications and improvements as experience may show to be expedient.Article 37.The Powers who have not signed the present General Act shall be free to adhere to its provision by a separate instrument.The adhesion of each Power shall be notified in diplomatic form to the Government of the German Empire, and by it in turn to all the other Signatory or adhering Powers.Such adhesion shall carry with it full acceptance of all the obligations as well as admission to all the advantages stipulated by the present General Act.* * * * *
APPENDIX (B).Text of Brussels Declaration of July 2, 1890.THE Powers assembled in Conference at Brussels, who have ratified the Genera] Act of Berlin of the 26th February, 1885, or who have acceded thereto,After having drawn up and signed in concert, in the General Act of this day, a collection of measures intended to put an end to the negro Slave Trade by land as well as by sea, and to improve the moral and material conditions of existence of the native races,Taking into consideration that the execution of the provisions which they have adopted with this object imposes on some of them who have possessions or Protectorates in the conventional basin of the Congo obligations which absolutely demand nev, resources to meet them,Have agreed to make the following Declaration : The Signatory or adhering Powers who have possessions or Protectorates in the said conventional basin of the Congo are authorised, so far as they require any authority for the purpose, to establish therein duties upon imported goods, the scale of which shall not exceed a rate equivalent to 10 per cent, ad valorem at the port of entry always excepting spirituous liquors, which are regulated by the provisions of Chapter VI of the General Act of this day.After the signature of the said General Act negotiations shall be opened between the Powers who have ratified the General Act of Berlin, or who have adhered to it, in order to draw up, within the maximum limit of 10 per cent, ad valorem, the condition of the Customs system to be established in the conventional basin of the Congo.Nevertheless, it is understood 1. That no differential treatment or transit duty shall be established ;2. That in applying the Customs system which may be agreed upon, each Power will undertake to simplify formalities as much as possible and to facilitate trade operations ;3. That the arrangement resulting from the proposed negotiations shall remain in force for fifteen years from the signature of the present Declaration.At the expiration of this period, and failing a fresh Agreement, the Contracting Powers shall return to the conditions provided for by Article IV of the General Act of Berlin, retaining the power of imposing duties up to a maximum of 10 per cent, upon goods imported into the conventional basin of the Congo.The ratifications of the present Declaration shall be exchanged at the same time as those of the General Act of this day.APPENDIX (C).Agreement respecting the Tariff of the Eastern Zone of the Conventional Basin of the Congo, signed at Brussels, December 22, 1890.THE Undersigned, Sir John Kirk and Mr. M. Gosselin, Delegates of Great Britain; M. le Comte d&apos;Alvensleben and M. W. Gohring, Delegates of Germany ; M. le Baron de Renzis and M. A. Bardi, Delegates of Italy, duly authorised to that effect by their respective Governments, in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration signed at Brussels the 2nd July, 1390, as well as of the General Act of the Conference of the same date, have agreed to modify in the following manner, within the limits of the eastern zone of the conventional basin of the Congo, Article IV of the General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885, in accordance with the conditions specified in the said Declaration: 1. Great Britain, Germany, and Italy, in the territories under their influence situated in the eastern zone of the conventional basin of the Congo, and which are subject to Article IV of the General Act of Berlin, shall have the right to levy duties on goods imported into such territories, either by land or by water, in accordance
with the Customs Regulations actually in force under the Treaties with Zanzibar, which provide for an import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem.2. Arms and ammunition introduced in accordance with the special provisions of the General Act of Brussels may, however, be charged with an import duty not exceeding the rate of 10 per cent, ad valorem, provided that the Treaties containing contrary stipulations are modified, and that circumstances permit of it.3. The import duty to be levied on alcohols shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VI of the General Act of Brussels^4. The following goods shall be admitted free of duty, viz. : agricultural machines and instruments, as well as all materials intended for the construction and maintenance of roads, tramways, and railways, and,.generally speaking, all means of transport.5. The present Agreement shall come into force at the same time as the Acts signed at Brussels &quot;the 2nd July, 1890. It shall remain in force for a period of five years, and continue in operation for five more years and so on for periods of five years, unless one or other of the three Powers demands its revision six months before the expiration of the quinquennial period.APPENDIX (D).[20444] --.Interdepartmental Committee on Revision of Treaty Arrangement with Enemy States.THE Committee held its third meeting at the Foreign Office on the 17th January, 1917.Present:Foreign Office Sir A. Law, ChairmanMr. Wellesley.Mr. Blech. Colonial Office  Mr. Risley..Mr. Davis. Board of Trade Mr. Ashley. India Office Mr. Wakely.Mr. Garrett.Mr. C. S. Nicoll, Foreign Office, Secretary.The Committee met to consider what attitude should be taken in regard to the Berlin Act, 1885, the Brussels Act, 1890 (and the subsidiary Conventions), governing trade, navigation, and other matters in Central Africa.It was understood that it was hardly likely that Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee would touch upon the African questions in its general report which was soon to be issued.The chairman pointed out that if any part of Africa remained in German hands, it would be difficult to abrogate the Acts without general consent. On the other hand, if Germany were excluded from Africa, then, if the aim of the Colonial Office that only Powers having possessions in Africa should be parties to treaties affecting Africa were to prevail, she would be automatically excluded from all voice in the matter.It was therefore necessary to learn what advice the Territorial Committee was giving to His Majestys Government as to the fate of German territory in Africa.The position of neutral signatories was then discussed, and it was agreed that negotiation with them would be necessary with the object of obtaining their consent to the.abrogation or amendment of the existing conventions. It was pointed out that the war had revealed various methods of putting pressure on neutral States (e.g., the withholding of coal supplies).[502] E
Finally, after some further discussion, Sir A. Law proposed, and it was agreed&quot; That though the question of the future of the conquests of the Allies in Africa cannot be assured until the issue of war is more certain, the Committee consider that the Berlin and Brussels Acts and the. dependent instruments should be regarded as at an end as between this country and our present enemies; and that those neutral.States which are parties to these instruments should be approached as soon as events render such action necessary with a view to the abrogation or revision of the Acts, &amp;c, so as to give this country and her Allies a free hand in future.&quot;(Initialled) C. S. N.January 17, 1917.APPENDIX (E).[61321] -Law Officers of the Grown to Mr. Balfour.Sir, Law Officers Department, March 22, 1917.WE were honoured with your commands signified in Sir W. Langley&apos;s letter of the 17th instant, transmitting, for your consideration, the accompanying papers relative to the question as to the extent to which the validity of multdateral treaty arrange-ments is affected by the outbreak of war between certain of the signatory Powers, and requesting us to favour you with our opinion as to the course which should be adopted, from the legal point of view, by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to such question.We have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your commands, have the honour to submit the following Report.Whatever may be the true view as to the extent to which treaties between belligerents are annulled or suspended by war, it is apparent that the victor may impose whatever terms he thinks fit as a condition of peace.. It follows that, in the case of those multilateral treaties to which the only parties are belligerents in the present war, there is no difficulty, in concert with such Allied Powers as may be concerned, in refusing to continue or to revive the treaty or in making variations or imposing new terms as a condition of revival.The difficulty arises in the case of treaties to which neutral States are parties. It is, in our opinion, substantially though not completely accurate to say that every multilateral treaty is &quot; in effect a set of bilateral arrangements fashioned into one whole for general convenience.&quot; But it does not, we think, always or necessarily follow that such a treaty can be annulled with respect to one or more parties without impairing the rights and obligations subsisting between other parties. The whole is something more than the sum of the parts. The relationships concerned are joint as well as several. So, for. exam pie, the international instrument which guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium could hardly have been annulled as between France and Germany after the war of 1870 without a violation of the rights of Great Britain.There are, no doubt, many treaties which may be annulled as between some of the parties without injury to the rights and obligations of the other parties as between themselves. In the case of treaties falling within this category, it appears to us that there is no objection to the course suggested by the Secretary of State. Neutrals cannot have ground of complaint where their rights under the treaty in question are ex hypothesi unaffected. But, if it is desired to annul or vary any treaties to which neutrals are parties falling within the other category (that is to say, treaties whose annulment or variation as between belligerents will affect the rights of neutrals), we are of opinion that the assent of such neutrals is necessary to the new arrangement or to the cancellation of the treaty, as the case may be.It does not appear to us that there would be, for the purpose, any legal usefulness in an announcement that Great Britain withdraws from her ante helium obligations towards the States now at war with her. So far as neutrals are concerned, the announcement would in the light of our opinion be-inoperative. So far as this country is concerned, there is already complete freedom to deal as is thought fit with ante helium obligations affecting only enemy States.We do not examine in detail the views stated in document (C). Much of the argument therein urged is familiar; but the line of reasoning, and the conclusions
apparently recommended, would lead to consequences to which, it seems to us highly inexpedient that the Government of this country should be committed.We have, &amp;c.FREDERICK SMITH. GORDON HEWART.APPENDIX (F).British Trade Interests in the German Overseas Possessions.Memorandum by the Board of Trade.1. Import Trade.THE total value of the importations into the German overseas possessions, other than Tsing-tau, in 1912, the latest year for which detailed statistics are available, was approximately 7,000,0001 Of this total the share ascribed to Germany was about 4,350,0001, whilst the United Kingdom participated in the trade to the extent of only about 540,0001. India and Zanzibar, however, were largely interested in the trade of German East Africa, the Union of South Africa in that of German South-West Africa, Australia and other British possessions -in the South Seas in that of German New1 Guinea and Samoa, and the Gold Coast had a share in the import trade of Togoland. Precise statistics are not available, but from the statistics set out in the Appendix it w^ould appear that (allowance being made on the one hand for the inclusion of some German trade in the Australian figures, and on the other hand for the inclusion of some British African trade under the heading of &quot; Rest of Africa&quot;) the share of the British Empire, other than the United Kingdom, in the import trade of the German overseas possessions may be estimated at approximately 1,000,0001.It should be added that of the exports from the United Kingdom cotton piece-goods and other manufactures of cotton represent about one-half of the total value ; and that the exports in 1913 were markedly lower than in 1912, owing chiefly to a sharp decline in cottons.In the case of Tsing-tau, the imports in 1912 were valued at a little under 5,650,000L, of which 2,354,000Z. were ascribed to China and the remainder to &quot; Other Countries.&quot; Tsing-tau is, of course, an important distributing centre, and though the direct export from the United Kingdom is insignificant, there is no doubt that the United Kingdom has in fact a large share of the trade (of which cotton yarns and manufactures constitute an important part).It wall be seen from Table I (appended) that the total imports into German East Africa were considerably greater than those into any other African colony. On the other hand, so far as the existing pre-war interest of the United Kingdom in the trade of the colonies was concerned, it appears that the imports from the United Kingdom into the Cameroons surpassed those into the other three German African colonies taken together. The safeguarding of existing British trade is therefore of most importance in exactly that colony which is most likely to pass out of British hands into those of our Allies.2. Production and Export Trade.Table II, appended to this note, gives the value of the export trade of the German Overseas Possessions (other than Tsingtau) in 1913 (1912); Table III gives the prin-cipal commodities, with the extent to which they were exported from each colony; and Table IV gives the areas in each colony under cultivation for principal commodities in 1913, and the extent to which those areas had actually reached the productive stage.It will be seen that the total exports in 1913 were valued at approximately 8,000,0001., and of this total diamonds from German South-West Africa accounted for 2,900,000Z., or approximately 36 per cent. The next most important commodity was rubber (from the Cameroons and German .East Africa); then followed copra (from New Guinea and East Africa), sisal hemp (from East Africa), palm kernels and palm oil (from West Africa), copper ore (from South-West Africa.), cocoa (from West Africa and Samoa), hides (from East Africa), raw cotton and cotton-seed (from East Africa and Togoland), and phosphates from New Guinea).The following notes relate to the produce of the individual colonies : German East Africa. The exports, valued at about 1,750,000Z., cover a wide range, including as they do rubber, sisal hemp, hides, copra, cotton, earth-nuts, bees-wax, coffee, and mica.   There were in 1913, 246,000 acres reported as under
&quot; European &quot; cultivation (rubber estates forming 112,000 acres), of which, however, only 123,500 had reached the productive stage (mostly rubber, sisal hemp, and cotton). Another 1,900,000 acres of forest reserves contain valuable woods : cedar, mangrove, &amp;c. An interesting product is mica, of which, however, the quantities are comparatively small. This commodity is of great importance for the electrical industries, and the supply of it is at present virtually controlled by India and Canada. It will be noted that German East Africa, the most developed of the German colonies (though as yet the development was only beginning), and the one possessing the most varied and useful resources, had also by far the largest import trade in^ 1913 of all the German colonies (except Tsingtau, which occupies a peculiar position). It is probably, from the commercial point of view, individually the most valuable of the German Oversea Possessions.German South-West Africa. The exports were valued in 1913 at approximately 3,500,000Z., of which uncut diamonds accounted for 2,900,000L, copper ore for 390,000L, and the only other item of note was a small export (31,5001.) of tin ore. The Board have no information as to plantation areas. From the point of view of Imperial development, probably the most immediately important contribution of German South-West Africa to the resources of the British Empire would be copper ore. In 1913 the United Kingdom imported 94,205 tons of copper ore, of which 72,700 tons from foreign countries and only 21,500 tons from British possessions (Australia and the Transvaal are the chief sources of supply); in the same year German South-West Africa exported 47,300 tons.German West Africa. The exports wrere valued in 1913 at approximately 1,900,0001. and consisted of the usual West African produce. About one-third of the value represented rubber (almost entirely from the Cameroons) ; palm kernels and palm oil accounted for nearly another third ; cocoa represented about one-sixth (Togo-land^ share in this commodity being very small), and the only other items of any note  though very small in amount were kola-nuts and ivory from the Cameroons and raw cotton from Togoland. The areas under &quot;European&quot; cultivation amounted to some 70,000 acres in the Cameroons (mostly cocoa, rubber, and oil-palm), and in Togo-land to only some 3,400 acres. The Cameroons, with three-quarters of the value of the exports from German West Africa, wTere of much more actual, and probably of greater potential, economic interest than Togoland.The Pacific Islands. Little need be said as to these. Their total export trade in 1912-13 was valued at about 850,000L, and consisted as to three-fifths in copra and as to the remainder in phosphates (New Guinea) and cocoa (Samoa). There are banana plantations in Samoa and rubber plantations in that colony and New Guinea.8. Tariff Regime.The tariff regime in operation in the German overseas possessions prior to the war was in general of a very moderate character, and no preferential tariff treatment was accorded in anv case to German  foods.In this connection it should be remembered that the freedom of Germany as to her tariff policy in Africa (elsewhere than in German South-West Africa) was restricted by (1) the Declaration respecting Import Duties in the Conventional Basin of the Congo, of the 2nd July, 1890, and (2) the exchange of notes with the British Government of 1885 as to the tariff regime in the territories on the Gulf of Guinea. These provided that there should be no differential duties; and a similar rule was established for the British and German possessions and protectorates in the Western Pacific by the Declaration of 1886.The following paragraphs set out briefly the tariff systems in force in the various German possessions prior to the war : (a.) German South-West Africa. Specific rates of duty were levied on a limited number of articles, mostly of a kind generally made the subject of revenue duties (tobacco, spirits, wines, beer, live cattle and sheep, meat, butter, margarine, sugar, fire-arms and ammunition, matches, and certain medicines), and all other goods were admitted duty free.(b.) Cameroons. There was an extensive free list, including all machinery and implements, railway materials, harness and saddlery, iron and steel for building, cement, window glass^ manures, fuel, scientific and medical instruments. Specific duties were levied on a few commodities (spirits, wine, beer, salt, perfumery, tobacco, fire-arms, and ammunition).   Articles made of textile materials paid 15 per cent, ad valorem, and
manufactures of iron, other than those on the free list, paid 20 per cent. ; all other articles paid 10 per cent. ..(c.) Togoland._The free list was somewhat less extensive tiian that oi theCameroons, though it included all agricultural and mining machinery and apparatus, and there were the usual specific duties on fixed commodities; all goods not included in these two lists paid 10 per cent, ad valorem.(d.) German East Africa. The tariff system of this colony was on lines practically identical with that of Togoland.(e.) German New Guinea. There was a lengthy free list, ^ including railway materials, agricultural machinery and implements, fuel, lubricating oils, tubes, telegraph wires, building materials of all kinds, manures, harness-makers&apos; goods, fence wires, ships&apos; ropes and hawsers, anchors. Specific duties w^ere levied on tobacco, spirits, wines, and beer ; ail other goods paid 15 per cent, ad valorem.(f.) Samoa. Apart from the usual specific duties on revenue articles, all goods paid 12-^ per cent, ad valorem.(g.) Tsing-tau. The rates of duty were those of the Chinese Customs Tariff, but certain articles were admitted duty free (the most important being industrial and agricultural machinery and building materials).4. In view of the extent of the import trade of the German possessions and its potential development, the amount of British trade there before the war, and the possibility of its rapid expansion if those possessions do not revert to Germany after the war, the nature of the tariff regime likely to be applied in them is a matter of direct and substantial interest, particularly to the trade of the United Kingdom and India.It appears therefore desirable to set out briefly the characteristic features of the colonial commercial policy of the countries other than the United Kingdom which are, or may claim to be, interested in the re-distribution of the conquered German oversea possessions.5. (A.) France. The French colonies (not including Algeria, where the rates of the French tariff are applied to all non-French goods imported and French goods are admitted free ; and Tunis, where a very long list of French goods are admitted free) fall into three groups : (i.) A small group including Dahomey, the Ivory Coast, French Equatorial Africa (the Conventional Basin of the Congo), French Somali Coast, and French India. In these, French and foreign products are subject to identical treatment, and the rates of duty are not high, varying from 3 per cent, to 10 per cent, ad valorem (with a limited free list).(ii.) A group consisting of Senegal, French Guiana, Upper Senegal and Niger, and Mauritania, wbere French goods enjoy a substantial preference. Thus all goods not specially mentioned in the tariff pay 5 per cent, ad valorem, but when of other than French origin they pay a surtax of 7 per cent. ad valorem. Unbleached cotton tissues pay a duty of 16 per cent, ad valorem when of French origin, but of 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, when of other origin.(iii.) A group which includes Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guinea, Reunion, Indo-China,New Caledonia, Gaboon, Mayotte and Comoro, and Madagascar and its dependencies. In these the general rule is that French goods are admitted free, whilst foreign goods are subjected to the same duties as those leviable on their importation into France itself.6. (B.) Portugal. The Customs regime in force in the Portuguese possessions in Africa is somewhat confused. Thus, in Portuguese East Africa there are two groups of tariffs in force-one for the territories administered by the Mozambique Company and the other for the territories directly administered by the State. In the former there are specific or special ad valorem rates on a number of articles, and all others pay 10 per cent. ; but Portuguese goods pay on lower rates than those of the general tariff, e.g., those of a class which pay 10 per cent, under the general tariff pay only 3 per cent, when of Portuguese origin. &apos; In the territories administered directly by the State there are three tariffs in operation for different districts. When not separately enumerated imported goods pay 5 per cent, or 3 per cent, ad valorem, others pay higher specific or ad valorem rates; but Portuguese goods enjoy substantial preferential treatment in all [502] - . - F
cases where the duty exceeds 3 per cent, ad valorem. There are certain surtaxes in force in some areas.   The free list in both territories is small.As regards Portuguese West Africa: for three of its six districts, including Loanda, there is a schedule of duties, mostly specific, and goods not included in the schedule pay 20 per cent, ad valorem. Machinery, railway waggons, and rails are free, and Portuguese goods enjoy very substantial preference. In the other districts there are a number of what are described as &quot; free ports,&quot; but all goods entering them, whether Portuguese or foreign, pay 10 per cent, ad valorem. The non-differentiation is no doubt due to the agreement as to the Congo Basin.In Portuguese Guinea goods other than alcoholic beverages appear to pay only 3 per cent, ad valorem, and there is no Portuguese preference. . In the remaining Portuguese possessions in Africa (Cape Verde and St. Thomas and Prince&apos;s Islands) the rates of duty are in a few cases specific, but generally 20 per cent, ad valorem, with a substantial Portuguese preference.7.-(C.) Italy. In Tripolitania and Cyrenaica the general rate of duty is, on imported goods, 11 per cent., but cotton yarns and tissues, made-up cotton goods, woollen yarns and tissues, blankets, sewn woollen goods, carpets, sugar, and matches pay 8 per cent, ad valorem, whatever their origin, plus an additional specific duty, which is either not levied on Italian goods or is charged at a lower rate. The list of duty-free articles is unimportant, but includes agricultural machinery and implements. In Italian Somaliland and Erythrea there is marked Italian preference ; thus in Erythrea, whilst foreign goods generally pay 8 per cent, ad valorem and cottons pay 10 per cent., Italian goods are duty-free.8. (D.) Japan. The only Japanese overseas possessions of importance are Formosa, which is treated fiscally as an integral part of Japan, and Korea, in which the tariff in force prior to annexation is to be kept in force for a term of years under an agreement between the British and Japanese Governments.9. From the foregoing survey it appears that the commercial policy nominally pursued by Germany in her overseas possessions was of a markedly more liberal character than that of either France, Portugal, or Italy, in that it did not accord any preference to the produce and manufactures of the mother-country, though no doubt, in fact, German goods did enjoy a real preference in the German colonial markets. Further, as compared with the tariffs in force in the French possessions (where they are not restricted by the international arrangements as in the Congo), the German colonial tariffs were of a very moderate character. The general trend of the pre-war commercial policy of France, Italy, Japan, and even Portugal indicates quite clearly that, unless some safeguards can be established, the transfer to them of any portions of the pre-war colonial possessions of Germany would mean that at an early date British trade with those possessions would have to encounter differential, and, in some cases at least, high protective duties.10. The tariff systems of the various British overseas possessions vary so much that it is not possible to make any general statement as to relative levels of the Customs duties imposed by the Dominion and Crown Colony or Protectorate Governments respectively, but as a broad general proposition it may be stated that transference to the Dominions would be likely to result in the imposition of higher tariffs on goods of British manufacture than if the territories were placed under a Crown Colony system of administration.Shipping.11. In all the four German African colonies the bulk of the shipping visiting the ports flew the German flag before the war, but of the foreign shipping British vessels exceeded in total tonnage the tonnage of vessels flying all other non-German flags. The following figures, which relate to 1910, sufficiently illustrate the point: Total of Entrances and Clearances of all Vessels at Ports in German African Coloniesin 19.10.	German.	British.	Other.

It will be seen that our share of the shipping of the colonies was exceedinglyAt Tsing-tau also British shipping exceeds the shipping under other non-German flags, though in this case it does not fall quite so far below German shipping as in the case of the African Colonies.We have, no doubt, a right to anticipate that a much larger proportion will fall to the British Mercantile Marine after the war, and it is important that our interests in this matter should be safeguarded if any of the colonies fall to the share of ourAllies. .The measures that should be taken to that end present little difficulty. What is required in this case is little more than what we ask for in all commercial treaty negotiations, viz., (1) the right of all British vessels to come with their ships and cargoes to any port open to any Allied vessels ; and (2) a guarantee that in regard to port, harbour, lighthouse, and other dues, and in all other respects, such British vessels shall be placed on an absolute equality with vessels of any other nationality and vessels flying the flag of the nation to whom the territory is ceded.In view of the fact that France in practice reserves to national vessels the trade between the mother-country and Algeria, it is conceivable that she might desire in a similar way to reserve the trade between France and any other African possessions she may acquire. It would be desirable to resist any such action so far as we can, arid to insist that trade between any Allied country and any of the former German possessions should be open equally to all vessels flying Allied flags. It is not anticipated that such a claim is likely to be resisted seriously either by France or by any other Power. The practice of France in regard to Franco-Algerian trade is quite special, trade between France and more distant French colonies being open to foreign vessels. Portugal, though in principle she reserves her colonial trade, has, in fact, by a series of decrees, thrown open the greater part of that trade.Trade between Germany and the German colonies has always been open to vessels of all nations.Other Provisions.12. It is no doubt useless to make any attempt to secure any privileged position in regard to future concessions and enterprises in any ceded territories, and existing British interests in German colonies are probably negligible. Nevertheless, as a matter of principle, it would seem desirable that the arrangements between the Allies should include a provision safeguarding any existing concession accorded to any Ally by the former Government, or any enterprise or business interest which was in fact in existence at the outbreak of war.13. As regards existing German interests in the colonies, it is assumed that we shall not allow German firms to walk quietly back, but that, as in our own colonies, German interests will be liquidated, and the proceeds held in trust as part of the funds to be used for bargaining purposes. In particular German coaling stations should certainly be acquired for British purposes. The experience of the present war has shown how valuable a weapon the control of coaling stations by this country has placed in our hands. It is understood that such coaling stations were in existence before the war at the following German African ports, viz. : Swakopmund (German South-West Africa), Dar-es-Salaam (German East Africa), Duala (Cameroons), and Lome (Togoland). The Germans also had a coaling station at Tsing-tau and one in each of the following possessions: Samoa, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Caroline Islands, Pelew Islands, and Marshall Islands.14. A provision also seems desirable on the lines of that which is included in most commercial treaties that all Allied subjects and citizens shall have equal rights to engage m businesses, occupations or professions, and shall be treated on a like footing in regard to taxation, both national and local.(Initialled) H.

APPENDIX (G).Necessity for Providing Seaplane and Airship Bases and Aerodromes andfor Safeguarding Flying Rights.Copy of a Letter from Secretary, Air Board, to Captain L, S. Amery.Sirj April 18,1917.WITH reference to paragraph 48 of the Third Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee constituted as a Sub-section of the Committee of Imperial Defence for the purpose of considering the question of territorial changes in Africa and elsewhere outside Europe, I am directed by the President of the Air Board to submit the following points for the Committee&apos;s consideration : The rapid development in aeronautics during recent years makes it probable that aerial navigation will be as important a factor in peace as it has proved to be in war. It is consequently desirable, in any readjustment of territorial boundaries, to take into account the necessity for providing suitable seaplane and airship bases and aerodromes, and for safeguarding flying rights in the areas which the Inter-Departmental Committee has been considering from other points of view.Starting from Egypt, two routes to India could be developed: 1. From Port Soudan or the most southerly British point on the western shore of the Red Sea to Perim or Aden; then to Socotra ; thence to the Kuria Muria Islands; thence to Masrah Island ; thence to Baluchistan.2. An alternative and easier route is provided via Syria and the Euphrates and Tigris valleys to the Persian Gulf. It would be necessary to secure a seaplane base and an aerodrome at or hear Alexandretta, and flying rights across Syria, so as to strike the Euphrates at Jerablus or via Aleppo at Meskene. Thence the course of the river would be followed to its mouth i thence to Bushire; thence to Lingah or Jask; thence to Baluchistan. Arrangements would presumably have to be made with the Persian Government to secure seaplane bases and aerodromes at Bushire, Lingah, and Jask.Australia. In order to be able to connect Burma and Australia via the Malay States and Singapore, it would be necessary to acquire, by purchase or exchange, seaplane bases in some of the islands of the Malay Archipelago now belonging to the Dutch.Africa. The course of the Nile and the chain of Central African lakes appear to afford a satisfactory aerial route for seaplanes from Egypt to Northern Rhodesia.Cameroons and Togoland. With reference to paragraphs 24 to 26 inclusive of the Second Interim Report, it would be desirable to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the French to enable us to cross their territory from the vicinity of Lake Chad to our own territory in the neighbourhood of El Fasher.Transatlantic Communication. In this connection the acquisition of a seaplane and airship base in the Azores is of the utmost importance. The Azores form a convenient pivot ^ for aerial communication with England, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, and St. Vincent on the east, and Bermuda, Halifax, and Newfoundland on&apos; the west. An aerial base in this group of islands would be of the greatest strategic value for patrolling the Atlantic.An alternative transatlantic aerial route from Great Britain to America, would start from the North of Scotland and pass through the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland to Newfoundland and Labrador. This latter route would, for climatic reasons, only be available under the best circumstances from June till October, and even during that period it would be liable to be seriously interfered with by fog.I am, &amp;c.
