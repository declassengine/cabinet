SECRET.G-150. -r   5REPORTS ON THE VISIT OF THE  LABOUR DELEGATION TORUSSIA, APRIL-MAY 1917.I.-General Report.Tfie Military Situation.&amp;ENERAL GOURKO put the position thus :-&quot;The armies under the old regime used to attack when ordered. Now the order to attack would be discussed by Soldiers&apos; Councils and either delay or refusal would follow.&quot;The General was quite candid in explaining the reasons now given by the Councils. Under the old dispensation attacks were made, often without sufficient artillery for modern warfare, barbed wire having to be cut with &quot; nippers &quot; with consequent heavy losses in men. The General, of course, is a man who believes in men obeying orders no matter the consequences. But there was no doubt in our minds that he volunteered this statement as showing how difficult it was to discipline an army under the circum-stances. Gourko and other Generals we met hap! anxieties about the new officers commissioned straight from the &quot;ranks.&quot; Firstly, it being impossible for them to go through the schools, their lack of knowledge did not tend to make them become efficient officers. Secondly, such officers; as was natural had strong political revolutionary ideas, and therefore, the ears of the Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils. It naturally followed that there was an hiatus between old and new regime officers.After visiting the. armies of the North and West fronts, the former under General Russky&apos;s command, and the latter under General Gourko&apos;s, we came away with the impression that for all practical purposes, those armies could be chalked out. There seemed an utter absence of discipline in the army under Russky. Two incidents that came within our knowledge will in some degree show the measure of indiscipline. We were informed by a soldier speaking English that his comrades at that time frequently fraternised with the enemy in the front firing lines and that only the week prior to our addressing the troops a large meeting had taken place at which a resolution was carried unanimously declaring that officers&apos; pay, from General to subaltern must be the same as privates. , The soldier declared they expected the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council to see the resolution carried into effect. Another incident showing that tbe High Command had lost control, or were impotent in the matter of enforcing discipline, occurred at the table of General Vsouloukeidze, with whom we lunched. The private soldier, delegate from Minsk, who was with us, held a meeting of junior officers at the opposite end. of table to. that where the General sat. From the interpreter we gathered that the soldier was denouncing M. Miliukoff and the Provisional Government -in general. He was also urging the young officers not much urging required to impress upon other officers, and men to stand by the instructions issued from time to \ time by the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council. -The General heard this man and looked on helplessly. We were informed food, supplies of troops were bad, materials of war were lacking, horses were dying for want of fodder, transport facilities wretched, and desertions had, up to that time, taken place en masse. We felt the only hope for this state of&apos; things was the formation of Coalition Government with strong Minister for War.   That has since,happened; but these were our impressions at the time.Too gloom)&apos; a view ought not to be taken; for bad as the situation was, it would-    [692] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1917.
have been much worse had the old regime been existing. Bad as affairs were, the Coalition Government, before we left Russia, had brought about an improvement, and the improvement showed evidence of accelerating progress. .Neither should a gloomy view be taken of the reports now coming from Russia with regard to soldiers&apos; deputies coming back from armies to Petrogrd, Moscow, Dvinsk, Minsk, and Pskov. Their reports of soldiers&apos; determinations and the comments re same in their &quot;journals,&quot; and the extracts from both wired to newspapers here, are simply phrases; disturbing, it is true, to us Westerners, but of less weight to Russian people. All these reports as published in newspapers at home ought to be judged in the light of those reporting the visit of M. Kerensky and M. Thomas to the troops. Similar reports and comments in our newspapers do not better the position. The effect they do produce is to dishearten the men at head of affairs, working at an almost super-human task. Cannot something be done similar to the action taken some time ago, when Mr. Balfour met the editors in London ?The Political Situation.The leaders of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council are in the Coalition to press that the Allies shall issue a new note, accepting the policy of &quot;no annexations, &amp;c.&quot; This is a real danger spot, because unless the Allies do something in the matter, the Coalition will break up, and possibly a separate peace with Germany will become the propaganda of the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council. We believe that &quot; no annexations, &amp;c,&quot; are mere phrases. When asked whether Alsace-Lorraine becoming again French territory was annexation, Deputies replied &quot;No!&quot; When asked whether Germany should pay for material damage done in Belgium, France, Serbia, the Deputies replied &quot;Yes!&quot; They didn&apos;t consider that charge a contribution or indemnity. We asked if they would accept the phrases &quot;Restitution&quot; and &quot;Reparation&quot; in place of their &quot; No annexations, &amp;c.&quot; They replied that this seemed reasonable, but would not definitely commit themselves.The civil population are led to believe that there is now nothing to continue the war for.   They have their freedom what more is necessary, &amp;c. ?   They are swayed in this direction by intense German propaganda, carried on right through Russia. This propaganda is not only for separate peace, but viciously anti-British.   Russia is flooded with German agents and money, and their organisation and operation ranges from purchase of newspapers and flooding of workshops and armies with leaflets to paying women to stand in food queues denouncing Great Britain as responsible for shortage, high prices, and continuance of war.   Not only that and on this point there should be no doubt German propaganda is intent upon establishing an opinion favour-able to German economic exploitation of Russia when the war is over.   In this connec-tion it ought to be stated that our Consular Service in Russia is in a bad state.   We have not generally men of sufficient calibre in brains, training, or experience.    Perhaps this arises from the fact that salaries are wretchedly low.   In an important industrial centre like Moscow we pay our consul 6001. per annum.   Mr. Lockhart, the present consul, is a very capable man, high in the estimation of the British colony and of Russians generally.   But 600Z. a year for a man like Mr. Lockhart is in itself poor pay, to say nothing of keeping up the status of a British representative.   We suggest that in every consulate of importance there should be two men, one having charge of commer-cial matters and the other carrying on the duties of the consulate as at present the latter to be the superior officer.   With great respect we urge that Russia is an Empire of great area, with a population of 180 millions, and with enormous possibilities of not only being a great market, but -of developing into the greatest economic Power in the world.   Its mineral, oil, and food-producing resources are practically untapped.   When war is over, the struggle in exploiting these resources will, if no effort is now put forward by Great Britain, remain a matter of conquest between America and Germany, with advantages in favour of the latter.Admittedly Russia and its part in the war is at the moment the grave concern of our Government. But the future of ou*r relations, economic and political, ought not to be overlooked, even in the throes and travail of waging the war.Food Prices and Wages.Owing to the-absence of organisation, people often wait in queues all day and night, and, on arriving at shop-doors, were told &quot; Sold out.&quot; It is not correct to say-that the increase of wages has inflated food prices.   There were scarcely any increases
II. Report by the Secretary to the Delegation.The Petrograd Workmen s and Soldiers Council.On arrival at Petrograd on the 14th April, we got into touch, immediately with the Provisional Government and the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council. The Provisional Government received us most cordially, and made arrangements for us to visit the Russian front. The Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council Executive Committee received us at first with a certain amount of reserve, but they were quite courteous, and the discussions we held with them from time to time were carried on quite amicably. The Council isv composed of soldiers&apos; deputies elected from regiments and workmen from factories, together with delegates from various sections of the Socialist movement, the four principal being the two wings of the Social Democratic Party (who are the most doctrinaire), the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and the Labour group.The GounciVs Pronouncement on the War.The Executive Committee of the Council were easier to know the attitude of the British Labour movement towards their pronouncement on the aims of the war, and they were most anxious that we should use our influence with the British Labour party in order that the British Government might be induced to endorse the pronouncement. We pointed out to the Committee that the attitude of the British Labour and Socialist movement as a whole had been expressed in resolutions passed at the various annual conferences of the British. Labour party, the Trade Union Congress, and the General Federation of Trades Unions, and that we represented the views expressed by the majority of the delegates at these conferences.Peace Formula.We discussed, however, at considerable length on several occasions with the Committee the terms of the pronouncement, and pointed out that the simplicity of the formula of &quot; No annexation and no indemnities &quot; rendered it ineffective as a statement of Allied aims. We asked whether the transference to France of Alsace-Lorraine, for instance, would be considered to be an annexation, and whether insistence upon payment from Germany for damage done in Belgium, Northern France, Poland, and elsewhere would be considered to be a demand] for indemnity. We also suggested that the third clause in the pronouncement -&quot; the right of any nationality to settle its own destiny &quot;  would probably lead to a transference of territory and people from one Power to another, and such transference might be considered to be annexation. The Committee could not give a clear and definite interpretation of the phrase &quot; No annexation and no indemnities &quot;; but they agreed that transference of territories and peoples must take place, and that the damage to Belgium, Northern France, Serbia, &amp;c, must be paid for. In reply to a direct question, the Committee repudiated the idea that they were in favour of the status quo ante bellum. They were, however, most anxious that the three clauses in their pronouncement should be adopted by the Allies in principle, leaving discussion of details to the Peace Conference whenever it meets. Our ast meeting with the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council Executive Committee took place on the day we left Petrograd (16th May), and lasted from midnight until 4 in the morning.   The main purpose of this meeting was again to endeavour to obtain* It could not be ascertained whether scarcity of food or high prices iu towns arose from the causes mentioned above, or whether there was not an actual shortage of food in the country as a whole. W. S S.nip to the fall of the old regime, and since then wages have not risen unreasonably. At ,a Putilov factory in Petrograd the wages of women under the old regime were 2&apos;88 a day, and are now 4 roubles. True, when we left, Moscow, weavers were demanding an increase from 1&apos;50 roubles a day to 4&apos;50. But a system existed by which employers bought food and supplied it to workers at pre-war prices. Presumably, at a wage of 4&apos;50 workers would buy their own food. Prices of food have risen almost wholly as a result of lack of transport, lack of organisation, fall in value of rouble, and profiteering.*JAMES 0&apos;GRADY.WILL THORNE.WM. STEPHEN SANDERS.
definitions of the phrases &quot;No annexation,&quot; &quot;No contributions,&quot; &quot;Self-assertion of peoples.&quot; The Committee finally declared that these phrases would not now be defined, but that the proceedings of the suggested International Conference would settle them. The French Delegation, with whom our relations were quite harmonious, was with us at all our conferences with the Committee, and on the last occasion M. Thomas and M. Brouckere (of Belgium)&apos;also attended. -The Committee were also desirous that the British and French Socialist and Labour movement should be represented at the conference the Committee were inviting to meet at Stockholm. We promised to place the invitation before the Labour and Socialist movement in Great Britain.Meetings with other Organisations and Soldiers.While carrying on our communications with the Executive Committee of the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council, we also addressed meetings of delegates of the various sections of the Council itself, such as the Jewish Bund and the Labour group. The latter body is the most moderate and anti-German of the various sections, and appears to be influenced very largely by M. Tchakofsky, who for many years was resident in this country. A large Teachers&apos; Conference, representing a very influential section of people, was addressed. We, together with the French Delegation, placed a wreath on the graves ot the men who fell in the fighting during the Revolution. We addressed a large meeting held under the auspices of the Anglo-Russian Society, at which several members of the Provisional Government and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador also spoke. We visited the barracks of the Volynski regiment and addressed-every company. The spirit of the soldiers and their discipline appeared to be quite good. Before we left, over 700 men from this regiment were drafted to the front.The Putilov Factory.We also visited the Putilov factory, where we understood about 20,000 people were employed. The factory was under the control of a Workmen&apos;s Committee, who informed us that they were turning out about 25 per cent, more munitions than they had been able to do during the last weeks of the old regime. They com-plained that under the old regime they were kept short of fuel and material, and on several occasions had been locked out owing to shortage in these respects. They were working nine hours per day, and stated that they were quite willing to work longer, provided fuel and material could be secured. We went through the various workshops, where we found that the workpeople were working satisfactorily, and the organisation admirably controlled and proceeding smoothly. The Workmens Committee were an intelligent body, and, although connected with the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Committee, they requested us not to think that their views were always rightly expressed by the middle-class Intelligenzia, who formed the majority of the executive of that body.The Press.We gave interviews to the leading newspapers of Petrograd, but we found that it was difficult to get into touch with the journals that expressed the views of the extreme sections connected with the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council. These papers appear to be entirely in the hands of journalists who are desirous of concentrating the workmen&apos;s and soldiers&apos; attention upon the question of peace.At the request, of the secretaiy of the Soldiers&apos; Republican Union, I drafted a pamphlet giving an account of the British aims in the war, and suggesting that the first necessary task of the. New Russia was the military defeat of Germany. This pamphlet, I understood, was to be translated and distributed amongst the soldiers.   .Visit to Moscow.From Petrograd we went to Moscow, where we were reecived by the local Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Committee with cordiality and courtesy. We visited the Moscow Munition Factory, at which the workmen appear to be working without friction. We addressed meetings of the co-operators, students, the right wing of the Socialist-Democratic party and the soldiers. The left wing of the Socialist-Democratic party, however, declined to meet us, on the grounds that we represented the majority and not the minority of the British Socialist and Labour movement, that both the
French and British delegates had taken part in their bourgeois Governments, and that they (the left wing of the Social Democratic party) believed in Eussia making an immediate peace, and insisted on a social revolution throughout Europe.I.L.P. Repudiation.At Moscow we learnt that the I.L.P. in England had issued a repudiation of the British Delegation, stating that we did not represent the British Labour and Socialist movement. We drafted a reply to this repudiation, which appeared in a number of papers in Moscow. Following this letter, an article appeared in the organ of the Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Committee at Petrograd explaining that we represented the views of the recognised majority of the British Labour and Socialist movement, and were therefore entitled to be received by the Labour and Socialist movement in Russia. In this connection the telegram sent to Kerensky and signed by Mr. H. M. Hyndman and others proved most useful. It should be mentioned that the repudiation of us by the I.L.P. did not appear to affect adversely our relations with the various workmen and soldiers&apos; organisations with whom we came in contact. We were always given an opportunity to explain who and what we represented, and it was only extremists, such as Lenin, who made use of the I.L.P. resolutions and statements which appeared in English papers against us.Visit to the Front.From Moscow we paid a ten days&apos; visit to the Western and Northern fronts. We addressed a number of meetings of soldiers. On some occasions the meetings comprised from 3,000 to 5,000 men. We were always received with enthusiasm, especially when we impressed upon the soldiers the necessity of defeating German militarism in order to ensure the permanence of Russian freedom. At these meetings, however, two delegates from the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Committee at Minsk also spoke. One of them talked crude Marxist socialism and laid great stress on the necessity of the Allies agreeing to the terms of peace drafted by the Workrnens and Soldiers&apos; Council at Petrograd, repeating continuous!y the phrase of &quot; no annexations and no contributions.&quot; It is true that he also declared that there must be no separate peace and no fraternising with the Germans, but the impression he conveyed was that the war was practically a capitalist one, and therefore not of particular moment to the Russian democracy. We did our utmost to nullify this impression, and we think we were to a certain extent successful.Interviews with General Gourko.We had two interviews with General Gourko who expressed the opinion that his army would, if time could be given, get over the disorganisation caused by the revolution and settle down to steady campaigning. He pointed out, however, that there were still grave difficulties in connection with transport, leading to shortage of ammunition. There was also insufficient fodder for horses which rendered movement very difficult. We also met General Russky at his headquarters, but as he wras ill we were not able to discuss the situation with him. He had, moreover, resio-ned on the dav we visited him.The Soldiers&apos; Committees.We were struck by the excellent physique of the Russian soldiers and their remarkably good spirits considering the circumstances in which they had been living during the winter. There is, however, no doubt that there are certain elements in the Soldiers&apos; Committees who are more interested in politics and in peace than in restoring discipline on a new basis in the army. Both in the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils and the Soldiers&apos; Committees the Jewish element is very strong, and we could not help feeling, although none of us is an anti-Semite, that the Jewish influence has nearly always an anti-British and pacifist tendency, arising probably from the fact that the Jews in these Comittees are nearly always extreme Socialists, whose socialism is drawn almost entirely from German sources. It was the Jews who, almost invariably, brought up at our meetings questions relating to English rule in Ireland, Egypt, or India and criticised British Imperialism which they insisted was the counterpart of German Imperialism. They lost no opportunity of urging an immediate peace at almost any price.
Discipline in the Army.It. is difficult to express an opinion as to the state of discipline in the armies as a whole that we visited. In some places it appeared to be good and relations between officers and men quite satisfactory ; on the other hand, in some places, as for instance at Pskov, we were informed privately by the officers that the men were decidedly insubordinate. We were told by a number of officers, including Generals, that the rank and file refused to do outpost duty and this had to be done by the officers themselves. In general there was an air of slackness about all the armies, au absence of definite work which, we could not help thinking must tend to inefficiencv, although we were informed that we must not judge the E-ussian army from the British standpoint.The Coalition Ministry.On our return to Petrograd the crisis which ended in the establishment of the Coalition Ministry was at its height, and it was not completely settled un il after the time of our departure; but we feel that the settlement arrived at has/caused great improvement in the situation. Kerensky, whom we met, struck us as/ being a very sincere and able man with a powerful personality. He appears to be trusted both by the workmen and the soldiers. The other Labour and Socialist representatives who joined the Coalition have also the confidence of the people they represent, and are, with the exception perhaps of Skobelef, level-headed and sensible men. Skobelef is not an extremist, but he is nevertheless a very strong pacifist., with an almost pathetic, belief that the Russian revolution will influence the German people to bring about a movement on similar lines in Germany, which will be followed by peace. He is a visionary, apparently with little experience of affairs.The Cost of Living.With regard to the civil population there is no doubt a strong feeling in favour of peace, owing largely to the difficulties in connection with the food supply. The cost of living has gone up tremendously in the towns; for instance, in Moscow careful examination or prices, based on statistics supplied by a local hospital, showed that the cost of living haxl increased in that town 400 per cent, since the beginning of the war. We were informed by some people that there waS&apos;plenty of food in the country, but the difficulties of transport caused a lack of supply in the towns. Other persons assured us that the stock of food in the country was, unfortunately, very low ; but we had no means of finding out the truth of either of these statements. The cost of living has also been artificially inflated by increases in wages and by the presence in the towns of large numbers of well-to-do persons, who previously lived in the districts now occupied by the enemy.Labour Unrest.Unrest, caused largely by high prices coupled with disclosed high profits, appeared to be very rife in the factories in the Moscow reo-ion. This unrest was, no doubt, stimulated by the more extreme sections of the revolutionary elements, which the more moderate members of the local Workmens and Soldiers&apos; Council found great difficulty in keeping under control. Outwardly, however, Moscow and Petrograd, in spite of constant big demonstrations and meetings, were quite peaceful and orderly.The Stockholm Conferences.On our journey home we stayed at Stockholm, and held a conference with M. Branting, M. Huysmans, M. Van Kol, and M. Troelstra, all of whom we know well, on the subject of the proposed separate conferences between the various national Socialist&apos;majorities and minorities and the International Socialist Bureau Executive. They were exceedingly anxious that the British Socialist and. Labour movement, both majority and minority, should come to Stockholm, and informed us that they hoped that the result of the conferences would be to place the responsibility for the war and its continuance upon Germany. They feared that unless England and France were represented the German influence would be very strong with the highly susceptible Russian Socialists. M. Branting and M. Van Kol are pro-Ally, but Troeistra is suspected of German sympathies. He informed me confidentially that he was responsible for the alteration in the policy of the German Foreign Office, which had at. first refused to allow the German Socialist minority to go to Stockholm.
The Causes of the RevolutionWhile at Petrograd we endeavoured to discover the real causes of the revolution, and after consulting a number of persons of various political opinions we came to the conclusion that, although there had been much discontent in the army and among the civil population, together with considerable underground revolutionary propaganda prior to the outbreak, the downfall of the old regime was mainly due to a deliberate plan of the Government to provoke disturbances (which were to be suppressed) in order to justify further reactionary measures, and to bring about peace with Germany on the ground that Russia was not in a position, owing to internal troubles, to continue the war. This plan, however, failed because the soldiers who were expected to fire on the people refused, except in a few instances, to do so, and turned their arms against the authorities. We were assured that if the Tsar had consented a few weeks earlier to create a representative ministry with a moderate reform programme the revolution would not have taken place.General Impressions.We left Russia feeling that the leaders of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council at Petrograd had at last felt the necessity of ceasing to be an Opposition Government, and were endeavouring conscientiously to co-operate with the Provisional Government to bring about order and stability in Russia. If Kerensky&apos;s energies hold out we think he will be the man to save the situation.Conclusion.In conclusion, we wish to place on record our appreciation of the kindness and attention which we received at the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Petrograd, Christiauia, and Stockholm, and of the British consuls at Moscow and Bergen.W. S. SANDERS, Lieutenant.o
