[This Document is the Property of His Britannjs jgflesty&apos;s Government,]&quot;      194SECRET.G-137. t     0Allied Conference at Petrograd, January-February 1917.REPORT ON MISSION TO RUSSIA, BY MAJOR DAVID DAVIES, M.P.Notes on Political Situation. (Previous Papers Nos. G-130, G-131, G-132, G-133, and G-134.)THE o-eneral condition of affairs in Russia is summed up in the description given bv a Moscow gentleman, who said : &quot; Here we have simultaneously a war on two fronts, the internal and the external, and success on one of these is in inverse proportion to success upon the other. A victory in the field brings sterner reactionary measures at home, whilst on the other hand reverses at the hands of the enemy bring a corresponding measure of liberty, and the opportunity for increased activity, to the progressive forces within the nation.&quot;The truth is that the broad aims and objects of the Allies in the war are incompatible with the ideas underlying the present system of government in Russia.Before the war many Germans had settled in Russia.   They were always German I enterprising, and were foremost in the commercial and industrial activities of the influence.! country; they exerted powerful influences, especially in Court and Government circles.   Unfortunately these influences still exist in many quarters, and there is no doubt that the enemy is kept constantly informed of every move and plan of operations. The result is, it is impossible to keep any information secret, and this has always to Secrecy be borne in mind in dealing with the Russian authorities. impossible.Russians may roughly be divided into three groups :  (a.) The pro-Gervians, whose sympathies and interests are entirely German. Pro-German These people are recruited from the Court, the Civil Service, and the group, business community.   If they could they would end the war to-morrow. They belong to the reactionaries, and profess to believe that Russian and German interests are identical, and must always remain so. (b.) The Nationalists, who are intensely patriotic and highly suspicious of any Nationalist outside influence, with an immense belief in the future of Russia.   They group, consider that they alone are capable of solving the problems confronting their own country.   They prefer to muddle through rather than accept extraneous assistance, unless this assistance takes the form of a gift without any conditions attached to it.In this group are to be found many military men of high rank, Ministers, officials in the Civil Service, a large number of deputies in the Duma, and many business men, especially in Moscow. These men represent the real Russia, whose great objects are to beat the enemy, to win Constantinople, and to build up a great Russian State free of,all foreign entanglements.Their hostility to the pro-German party has induced the more conservative sections of this group to form alliances with the progressive parties, which would have seemed impossible in peace time, and in this process they have become more liberal themselves.This is the group that will&apos;have to be reckoned with in the future, and whose confidence it is our duty to win. (c.) There is the pro-Ally group, who profess great admiration for our institutions, Pro-Ally and are frankly democratic and progressive.   They would welcome &quot;our group, collaboration and advice, and are willing to be taught the wisdom of the &quot;West.   This group has a following in the Duma, the Universities, and among: business men.   They declare themselves to be quite ready to see the Allies running the country, and they appear to believe that we can do tins in some mysterious way which they do not explain.The great mass of the population is inarticulate ; they desire to win the war, but The 0ne of their chief concerns is to obtain a larger share of the land and to change the peasants. [425] &apos; B
Land present system of land tenure. Land reforms on a large scale were introduced after reforms.       the revolution of 1905 - sinne then no-rimilrnral pn.nrjRrnf.inn has rrtorlp rarkir? c-fi^rU,,since then agricultural co-operation has made rapid strides under, the fostering care of the Zemstvos or County Councils, who have createc Agricultural Credit Banks and Co-operative Societies in many parts of the counts There appears, however, still to he a growing demand amongst the peasants for a wider distribution of land, and this may bring about greater changes in the social anc economic conditions in the country after the war when the soldiers return to their homes.A shortage of food aud fuel adds to the general discontent of the lower classes. This shortage is due to 1. The lack of facilities for transportation. 2. The foolish regulations prohibiting the sale of goods from one province to another.3. The fixing of maximum prices, which encourage the peasants to hoard tliei produce.- Condition ntxt winter.iDuma and Zemstvos.Issue to be raised.Possibilities of *revolution.Bribery.If there is no amelioration before next winter, the state of affairs will become desperate, and the internal conditions of the country may make it impossible, to carry on the war. The supplies of food and fuel arc more than sufficient to meet the needs of the people; the trouble is that while some provinces are on the verge of famine, in others there is a superabundance of agricultural produce, and food is actually being destroyed. The problem is simply one of distribution and organisation it is the task of organising the man-power and resources of the nation for war. No great man has, up till now, appeared on the scene who can shoulder this stupendous undertaking supported by the confidence of the Duma and the-nation.The Duma and Zemstvos have increased their influence enormously, and appearl to have won the confidence of the Army and of all the groups alluded to above, with! the exception of the pro-German and the Court party.   The Zemstvos stepped into the! breach during the crisis of 1915, when it was suddenly discovered that the Army was lacking in equipment and ammunition.   Their services at that time were eagerly] enlisted by the bureaucracy.   But, when the danger point was passed, and Brousilofs victories restored the prestige of the Army,  every attempt was made by theI Government to relegate .to them their old position, and every obstacle was placed the way of further developing their usefulness.   The advrent to power of M. ProtopopofJ who previously had been a prominent member of the Duma, instead of conciliatin!,i the progressive forces, evoked a fresh outburst, and widened the breach between tliel representative body and the Court party.   When the Duma meets it will probably! refuse to authorise the necessary credits for the Ministry of the Interior; it&apos;will-refuse! to sanction the large increases.necessary for the maintenance of the police whichl Protopopof has heavily reinforced.   Thus it is hoped a definite issue will be raised onj a question of policy involving an increase of taxation.   If the Duma refuses to astccito any compromise, the Government will be forced either to get rid of Protopopof or to dissolve the Duma, and the conflict with the Court party will be intensified, arrest of the representatives of the workmen on the War Trade Committee has added! fuel to the fire, and it is impossible to forecast what may happen.   It is true that the! old revolutionary societies, the Nihilists and the Anarchists, no longer exist, and it isj not believed that a popular rising would have any chance of success.   What majl happen is a Palace Revolution, ending in the removal of the Emperor and Empres The fact that the Army now sides with the Duma, that even the loyalty of the Guardl Begiment cannot be relied upon, that the Emperor and Empress are most unpopular! that the Empress is, rightly or wrongly, regarded as an agent of the Germa;i Government, all point in the direction of some move of this kind, and it is probably that a fait accompli will be accepted quietly by the country.   All will then depcn upon the new arrangements, and whether a wise progressive policy will be substituteij for one of repression.Bribery is still rampant in Prussia; some avenues of corruption are closed, bu8 new ones have been discovered and prices have risen, partly from the extra risks detection in war time, and partly owing to increased costs of living. It is admitte! that bribery forms a part of the Government system ; it is not regarded as immoraij The pay of all officials is so slender and inadequate that it is impossible for them tj live at all if thev do not resort to illicit means of augmenting their incomes. Hi official salary of the Chief of Police in Petrograd barely covers the rent of his housej and yet he is expected to maintain a large staff of officials and servants. While certaiT
195jroods are still being imported into Russia from enemy countries, it is just as certainthat sums of money are being paid by German agents to Government officials.Probably this was done in the case of the Murman Railway, where the conflictinginterests of the Archangel railway and port, assisted by/German money, contrived toprevent the construction of an efficient railway to Kola.   The only effective methodof combating this system is to go one better, to offer inducements to.the officialsconcerned to work whole-heartedly on the side of the Allies, and to pay themaccordingly upon the satisfactory results which they achieve.   When millions ofmoney are being spent and the success of military operations is involved, a fewhundreds of thousands of pounds may well be expended in this way to ensure thatour efforts are not being stultified.   It is the duty of our Government to see thatour agents are amply provided with the requisite funds.   More care should also Bestowal ofhe displayed in the bestowal of honours.   For instance, in the case of the Murman honours.]lailwav,*the ex-Minister of Ways and Communications and the engineer-in-chief ofthe railway have been awarded British decorations for their supposed activities on ourbehalf. The fact that the railway has not been able to discharge its functions properlyhas apparently been overlooked, whereas- if  these gentlemen had been awardedhonours on the basis of results, the decorations should not have been given until thecapacity of the railway had been tested.   There appears to be iittb co-operation ofdissemination of information between the different Departments of State.   With anonentity as Prime Minister, who enjoys the confidence of no party or group, this isnot surprising. It does not appear that this evil will be remedied until some system ofresponsible government, comes into being.    The lack of co-operation among the Lack ofDepartments renders the task of our representatives much more difficult, co-operation1 x betweenDepartments of State.The policy of the Allies should be as follows :- - Allied1. To endeavour to persuade the Empress by all possible means to leave Russia p^lC-&apos; and to remain as a guest in one of the Allied countries until the conclusion of the war.2. To watch closely the course of events and be ready to make proposals for thecarrying on of the Government&quot;if a revolution takes place. 3. To keep in closest touch with the leaders of the Duma and the Zemstvos, inorder to win their confidence and direct their activities into the properchannels.4. Under the present readme to insist as far as possible upon security of tenure in office of capable and loyal Ministers, who proved their devotion to the cause of the Allies.5. To conciliate the present Government officials, and to spend money when necessary to enlist their active co-operation in the carrying on of the war.Transportation.This is the most urgent problem of all. The success of military operations, the manufacture of munitions, and the feeding of the army and the civil population depend upon the efficiency of the railway and transport services, and no effort on our part should be spared to render all the assistance within our power to improve the existing state of communication in Russia. This subject has been dealt with fully in Mr. Bury&apos;s report, but there are one or two points which need to be emphasised.The report on the railway requirements of the country may be conveniently grouped under three headings : 1. The army.2. The civil population.3. Munitions and trade (including exports).Military Requirements.The present Russian front stretches from the Baltic to the Black Sea over a (istance of about 800 miles.   A large number of waggons and locomotives have to be Strategic vept in reserve in order that bodies of troops may be moved at short notice to any reserres of sector of this long front which may be threatened by the enemy, or to concentrateoops lor an attack at a certain pcint or points.   A constant stream of waggons are   0CK&apos; mpioyed in bringing up supplies of food and ammunition for the army.    But after ri^mg ample provision for the strategic and commissariat needs of the army, it is
Improper uses of rolling-stock.stated that&apos;a large amount of rolling-stock is improperly used for other subsidiary purposes, such as the housing of soldiers and the storing of supplies. It is also asserted that the strategic reserve of rolling-stock is far in excess of military require-&quot;ments, and that some of the railways are so congested with waggons that at times they cannot be used at all. Attempts are being made to induce the military authorities to state their maximum requirements for strategic purposes.Distributing Commis-sions.Bail way officials.Transport of materialNon-essential material.Passenger service.Water-ways.Civilian Requirements.The civilian population, especially in tbe towns, has to be supplied with fuel and food, Rolling-stock for this purpose is supposed to be doled out by Commissions appointed in different parts of the country. The method of allocation adopted by these bodies are slow and cumbersome, with the result that thousands of waggons are often held up at various points waiting to be distributed. Sometimes they are delayed in this way for weeks and months. The decision of the Commissions as to the class of goods for which transport permits are to be issued are often circumvented by-corrupt means. Railway officials of all grades are bribed to supply waggons to private firms and individuals, with the result that as it is no one&apos;s business to offer bribes on behalf of the Government-munitions and Government material remain stationarv for long periods, whilst goods belonging to individuals are forwarded without delay.It would appear that the only way to overcome this difficulty is to pay the railway officials a bonus for the rapid transit of all Government material; in short, to make the interest of these gentlemen coincide with the interests of the Government and o the Allies.Eood and fuel are absolutely necessary for the civilian population, but at present a large number of waggons are used for conveying other materials which are non-essential for the conduct of. the war. The Government have been urged to take steps to prevent this. Similarly passenger trains should be reduced to a minimum, aud the ,-fares, which have always been low in Russia, should be raised. The Ministry have already made tentative efforts in this direction. During one week the passenger service was drastically curtailed, with a corresponding improvement in the goods traffic. The Government . has been urged to extend this programme. Another means of expediting the transportation of food and fuel lies in the exploitation of the water-ways. Russia possesses many navigable rivers, such as the Volga, the Dniester, and the Dwina. River transportation is capable of great development, provided a sufficient number of barges are constructed immediately, and the points of trans-shipment are equipped with the necessary machinery for handling the traffic. The Government has been urged to utilise the water-ways during the coming summer, and thus to accumulate large stocks of supplies at the most important centres, which can then be distributed during the ensuing winter.Location ofmunitionfactories.Fuel supplies.Munitions and Trade Requirements.Two distinct points arise in connection with this subject: 1. The transportation of the supplies of fuel and metals to the munition factories in Russia.2. The forwarding of munitions arriving at the ports from abroad to the centres of distribution and to the front.The majority of Russian munition factories are located in the large centres of population, like Moscow and Petrograd. On the other hand, coal and iron are produced in the south, in the Donietz region ; and metals in Eastern Russia and Siberia. This involves the hauage of the raw material over many hundreds of miies before it arrives at the factories. Before the war, Northern and Western Russia derived their coal supply from Poland, England, and Germany. As these sources have now been cut off, with the exception of^cargoes landed at Archangel, Southern Russia has been called upon to make good the deficiency, involving an increased strain upon the slender resources of labour at the mines and to a greater extent on the capacity of the railways; consequently some of the munition factories are threatened with a fuel and metal famihe, which is likely to reduce their output of shells and munitions, unless an improvement in the labour supply for the mines and the better organisation of the railways is effected.It is a matter for regret that the new munition factories have not been erected in
the coal and iron regions of Southern Russia, thus reducing the necessity for the transportation of raw materials over long distances. At Moscow a new factory had hist been completed, fully equipped with the most modern shell-producing plant, which we were told was intended to be used for the manufacture of textile goods at the conclusion of the war, and apparently the factory for this reason had been located at Moscow instead of being in close proximity to the supply of fuel and raw materials.Russian Ports.The Russian ports at present available for the importation of munitions are : Yladivostock, Archangel, Kola, Kem, and the Finnish ports on the Gulf of Bothnia, where non-contraband cargoes shipped via Norway and Sweden are handed over tothe Finnish Railways.Vladkostock.-The total annual capacity of this port is estimated at about 500,000 tons. The Siberian Trunk Railway has its terminus at Vladivostock, and, owing to the lack of rolling-stock, the amount of material despatched by the railway has steadily decreased, with the result that a large accumulation of supplies of all descriptions, estimated at from 400,000 to 500,000 tons, is now dumped at the port. Storage accommodation is inadequate to deal with the congestion, and large quantities of material are left lying about in the open, and must deteriorate in consequence. It is calculated that at least nine months must elapse before this accumulation can be despatched by rail at the present rate of transportation.It is suggested that in future the imports for Vladhrostoek should be limited to railway material, and that new rolling-stock ordered from America should be assembled here and despatched to Russia fully loaded.It has been suggested to the Russians that the port of Dalny, which is the terminus of the South Manchurian Railway, might be used to supplement Vladi-vostock until the congestion has been relieved. Dalny is under the control of Japan -it is an excellent port and has considerable storage accommodation. The South Manchurian Railway, which links it with the Siberian system at Harbin, has a different gauge from the Russian railways. The Japanese may have some method of altering their rolling-stock to enable it to be used over the Siberian railways, and a third line could easily be laid to allow Russian rolling-stock to run through into Dalny. If both these suggestions are impracticable, then  raffle destined for Russia would .have to be transhipped at Harbin junction. It is worth while considering how far it may be possible to use Dalny and Yladivostock for exporting agricultural produce from Siberia to England and France.Archangel. - This port can only be used during the summer and autumn months, normally it is open for traffic from&apos;the 1st June tothe 1st November, about 150 days. Last year it was possible with ice-breakers to keep the channel open until January, this was quite exceptional, and cannot be relied on, and navigation after November is precarious. There are at present tifty-two ber:hs, which it is expected to increase to seventy-two this summer. The new berths will not be in working order for some tune after the navigation season opens, and cannot, therefore, be fully reckoned on. kuch berth on an average is capable of unloading or loading about 300 tons daily. 1 he amount of tonnage necessarily varies according to the bulk and weight of the material which is being handled. It is difficult to &quot;form anv reliable estimate of the traffic which can he dealt with this year.So much depends upon unknown factors, such as the available supplies of machinery, labour, and fuel, immunity from explosions, which in the past has brought the activities of the port to a complete standstill and has prejudiced the efficiency of the workmen, and weather conditions. But, apart from accidents, it is predicted that daily capacity of the port for imports and exports is about 21,000 tons; which is equivalent to a total of about 3,200,000 tons for the navigating season. [ 16. Port is served by railway and river transport, and it is anticipated that the n 1 COrr,n and flax and tlie imP01&apos;ts oE coal can be conveyed up the River Dwina i arges. There is a considerable amount of storage accommodation, and it is possible c eat with any accumulations which mav aiise during the winter months when avigation is stopped, but the railway can still be used.imbei     ^ laige saw&quot;mills at Archangel, which have their own berths for shippingion ofa 0T Roumanoff&apos;--Tl^ is the onlv ice-free port in Northern Russia.

Capacity of port.Storage.Russian -estimates.Congestion at Kola.Exports from Kola.Kem.ports in the Empire.   Ships of almost any size can steam up the inlet, and there is splendid anchorage in the harhour.   At present there are only four berths, with a daily unloading capacity of about 1,500 tons.   It is expected to complete two more berths i in the course of the next two months, provided the material can be shipped from Archangel.The storage capacity is inadequate, and some of the sheds are at present heing used by the Russian naval authorities for the storage of meat. Additional storage is urgently required here, as there is almost certain to he congestion, and materials! stacked in the snow on the shore is bound to deteriorate.The Russian estimate of the amount of traffic which can be carried over the I Murman Railway has been most misleading up to the present.It is estimated that during the next two months there will be an improvemen and that it will be possible to forward about 600 tons daily from the port over the 1 railway.   Judging from the inaccuracy of previous forecasts this figure is not likely to be realised.   At the end of two months, or about the middle of May, when the thaw] comes, the railway will be entirely closed for traffic, and the whole of the summer will have to be devoted exclusively to the reconstruction and repair of the line, so that ill may be capable of working next autumn.   Although there are natural difficulties in I the shape of bogs and morasses which have to be crossed, none of these are insuperabl and as there are no mountains to cross there are no steep gradients or sharp curves. ] and there is an abundance of timber.   With all these advantages it is a cheap road both to construct and to run.   If it had been properly constructed one locomotiv would be able to haul from 400 to 600 tons, or from 4.0 to 60 waggons.   In itsi existing condition the maximum capacity of an engine is only about 140 to 160 ton: or from 14 to 16 waggons.   It would therefore appear that when the railway becomesI closed a large amount of munitions will be left lying at Kola, and the only possible means of transporting it to the front will be to tranship it to Archangel.   It isl suggested that it mav be possible to a limited extent to do this by means of the ice-breakers, even before the navigation season commences; but it is doubtful whether this operation is practicable.To avoid further congestion at Kola it is imperative that no more munitions! should be sent to the port until the present stock has been distributed by the railway. Tonnage has been, and still is being, held up there for weeks and sometimes for I months.   Congestion must be avoided,- otherwise the place will become a secom Vladivostock, and munitions urgentlv needed elsewhere will be left to deteriorate in 1 the snow.   The tonnage despatched from England and France should be regulate according to the stock of munitions still waiting to be sent out from the port, a daily records of the amounts unloaded from the ships, despatched by train, and mi storage should be sent to the authorities at home through the director of transport alj Petrograd.Unless a great improvement fakes place immediately there is no certainty thatj the present accumulation will be removed before May, after which the railway will hj closed. Urgent representations have been made to the Russian Government, and the essential point now is to ensure that the railway and wharf: shall be properlvl reconstructed before Archangel closes for navigation this year ; and that the arrival] of fresh cargoes is regulated by the amount despatched over the railway.At present there are no exports from this port, consequently vessels have to s&quot;ijl home with or without ballast. Recently it was stated that no material of any kind was available, and coal was put on board to serve this purpose which had only ju-l been shipped out from England. It appears that this had previously been done ail Archangel. If the railway was put into proper order, and supplied with sufficient! rolling-stock of which it is now sadly lacking there is no reason why grain fronfl Southern Russia and Siberia should not be shipped here.The port of Kem is also served by the Murman Railway.   It lies on the shore the-White Sea, about midway between Kandalaksla and Petrozavodosk.   At present it has six berths, which may be increased this summer to fifteen.The daily capacity of unloading at the port is estimated at about 3,000 tons. ffl is proposed to use it this summer for the import of coal, and it is hoped that tli railway south of Kem will be able to deal with the traffic, but this is also verjj uncertain, as the line up to Petrczavodosk has only recently been constructed.Labour.The labour at present available Many wounded soldiers are employedfor these ports is inadequate and inefficient! who are compelled to work at army rate!
alongside civilians who earn good wages. Owing to the shortage of food and had accommodation, it is difficult to induce civilians to sign on for dock labour. Finnish workmen are not encouraged, although they are good artisans and work hard. On the railway a great many prisoners and some Chinese are employed. The Russian Government has been pressed to employ military labour at all the ports, but up to the present they have declined to aecede to this proposal.Exports.The principal exports are wheat, flax, and timber. The Allies have been promised 500,000 tons of wheat by the Russian Government, to be shipped before JNovember. This amount is to be purchased in the following localities : the Crimea, the Caucasus, Siberia, Samara, and South-West Russia in the Kiev region. It is to be transhipped from Archangel, arriving there by various routes both by rail and by river transport  which involves in some cases four or five trans-shipmenls. It will be impossible to count on the total amount being delivered before the 1st November at the earliest. There has been considerable difficulty in &quot;finding a sufficient quantity of sacks. As the grain has to be man-handled so many times, and there are at present no elevators or machinery for loading it on board the vessels at Archangel, this is a serious draw-hack. Flax, to the amount of 100,000 tons, and timber are also to be exported from Archangel this summer.The estimated total capacity for exports and imports ior all the ports is therefore as follows :- Tons.Archangel        .. .. .. .. .. .. ..    8,200,000Kola   .. .. .. .. .... .. ..      1-20,000Vladivostock    .. .. .. .. ... .. ..      500,000Kcm ...      .. .. .. .. ...     .. ..      500,000Estimated grand total       .. ..        &quot;...   (about)  4,320,000Explosions.The explosions at Archangel have shown the need for care in the handling of materials, many of which are of a highly explosive and dangerous character. Precau-tionary measures should be insisted on at ail the ports.]. A stricter surveillance of the civilian population.2. The distribution of the storage and sorting accommodation at a suitable distance, so that if there is an explosion at one point it may not be able to spread to others.Railway Adviser.The function of Mr. Bury and his staff, whose business it is to advise the officers who manage the railways, is solely advisor)&apos;, and he has already sent in a report proposing certain reforms which will in his opinion increa.se the amount of available rolling-stock, hasten repairs and, if carried out, increase the capacity of all the railway systems in Russia. To be successful he will have to feel his way with caution and tact. His experience on the Canadian Pacific Railway has given him an inside knowledge of the special difficulties which are encountered In Russia; hence the speed with which he has been able to take in the situation and make certain proposals. This has astonished the Russians, who cannot understand how a man who has only been in the country a few weeks can diagnose the weak spot in the present system and make proposals as to how a remedy should be applied.Mr. Bury&apos;s plan is to put forward his proposals, to persuade the Russians to agree to carry them out, and to make it worth their while to do so. He will stand bv to make further suggestions, and to test the results obtained; otherwise he does not intend to take over any executive duties. W7hen he returns to Canada he will find a hrst-rate substitute to take his place. He is very anxious that we should make a great effort to send out some locomotives, however few, to Russia, as an indication of our good faith. The mere fact, he thinks, that we have made an effort.to assist them in this way will appeal to them immensely, and will help him to get his programme through.Mr. Bury lias formed a favourable opinion of M. Kriger, the Minister of Ways and Communications. He is a practical railway man, and Mr. Bury thinks we should spare no effort to keep him at his post.
He also thinks that the British transport personnel ought to be properly organised under one responsible head; that all the information re transport, the amount of imports and exports, the tonnage actually unloaded and loaded at the ports daily by rail or water transport, the amount lying in storage, and the amount still to be unloaded should all be available and at the disposal of a Director of Transport at Petrograd; that the officer would be in the closest touch with the position at the ports, and would maintain a proper check on the movements of munition supplies. When blockages or congestion occurred, the matter could be brought at once to the notice of the heads of the Russian Departments, and pressure exercised to have things put right.Russian Demands.Russian demands amount to 13,000,000 tons of munitions of all kinds, including guns, ammunition, aeroplanes, supplies of metals, raw materials, and other require-ments for the carrying on of the Avar.The maximum capacity of the ports for imports and exports was stated to be about 12,000,000 tons, but, on going carefully into these figures, it was proved that 4,250,000 tons was an optimistic estimate of the amount of material that could he handled this year.   The tonnage was allotted as follows : Tons.Artillery, including&apos;aeroplanes     .. ..       - .. .. ..   ],200,000Railway material .. .. .. ...        ..  (about)      700,000Coal   .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..    1,500,000For Roumania .. .. .. .. .. .. ..      120,000,, naval and other requirements .. .. .. .. ..      340,000,, metals       .. .. .. .. .. ..      280,000wire        .. .. ..        .. .. .. ..     110,000Total... .. .. .. .. ..   4,250,000c In addition to the artillery already promised, we have undertaken to supply the Prussian Government with 4 batteries of 6-inch howitzers, 2 batteries of 8-inch, and 1 battery of 9&apos;2-inch per month, commencing on the 1st June; also with a maximum of 800 aeroplanes, together with 50 Stokes and 50-2-inch trench mortars. Undoubtedly there is a shortage of metal and raw material required for the production of shells and munitions in the Russian factories, and this state of affairs has produced a demand from the Government to be supplied by the Allies with huge quantities of steel, copper, and other metals. There does not seem to be a sufficient reason why these demands should be granted. It is admitted that Russia possesses enormous quantities of undeveloped minerals, and that her mines at present are not working to their full capacity. There are large stocks of scrap and privately owned material which should be utilised for Avar purposes.There appears.to be a shortage of blast furnaces for the production of steel, but the main causes for the deficiency are : 1. The disorganisition and shortage of labour. 2. The luck of railway and water transport.3. The unwillingness of the Government to commandeer private supplies.Consequently, the real remedy lies with the Russian Government, who should be induced to mobilise industry, to utilise all its existing sources of supply, and to extract the maximum utility from their transport services. To satisfy their demands at the expense of our own production is to curtail the scope of our own military operations, to employ our tonnage, and at the same time to bolster up the inefficient methods of our Ally to still further congest his ports without any guarantee tiiat the material we supply will be efficiently or economically used. For these reasons, with the excep-tion of coal, I would deprecate sending to Russia any large quantities of raw material for the production of munitions.It is a question whether the number of trench mortars it is proposed to send is adequate in view of the importance of providing a suffici mt number on the Russian front. It is hoped that the Russians will be able to manufacture trench mortars in large quantities, but it seems to be extremely doubtful whether, under the slow procedure and the delays which prevail in Russia, their manufacturers will be able to provide trench mortars in any large quantities for military operations this year. It will probably be found that trench mortars can be used to great advantage on the Russian front on account of their portability.   Up till now their utility has not been
198recognised, because the personnel of the Russian trench-mortar batteries have not beerTsufficiently trained in their use. The heavy type of trench mortar with which they have been &quot;supplied did not prove so satisfactory as the 2-inch or Stokes.Itis suggested, therefore, that efforts should be made to provide a much larger number of trench mortars, and at the same time to urge the Russian authorities to increase their own output at home.. Personnel.The organisation of our personnel in connection with Russian undertakings is very important. When so many different Departments of State are involved, it is essential that there should be no overlapping, and that every official should know what his own job consists of, and that there should be one directing authority to delimit the various spheres of work in case of any question arising. It is also essential Importance that so far as possible, every&apos;Englishman who is employed in Russia should be able to oflangua e-speak Russian, otherwise he often becomes worse than useless he is constantly being imposed upon; in any case, he should be able to talk Erench. It was stated on good authority, that this rule does not apply in many cases, especially as regards naval officers. * It is perfectly obvious that we cannot expect the Russians to pay attention to our demands if they are being harassed by a crowd of officers who cannot speak Prussian, and who have no clearly defined duties.At present the following British personnel appear to be engaged on work of one kind or another: 1. The Embassy, subdivided as follows :-(1.) Diplomatic Section,  under Sir George Buchanan,  our Ambassador at Petrograd.(2.) The Military-Attaches, Colonel Knox, Colonel Blair, and Major Thornton, who are responsible for the despatch of all military intelligence and for keeping the War Office in close touch with the military authorities in Russia, and especially with the armies in the field. Up to now, part of this work, i.e., the distribution of enemy forces, has been done by the War Intelligence Bureau, under Lieutenant-Colonel Sir S. Hoare. General Sir Henry Wilson has made a proposal that in future all the Military military intelligence work should be done through Colonel Knox and his staff; on the Intelligence other hand, that the duties which Colonel Knox has hitherto carried out with regard to the supply of munitions for Russia should be transferred to an officer under the supervision of General Poole. This arrangement will prevent any overlapping and will clearly define the sphere of operations of these officers respectively.(3.) The Naval Attaches, who are responsible for all naval intelligence and for maintaining the closest relations between the Russian and British naval authorities.(4.) The War Trade Intelligence Bureau, at present installed in the Russian War Office, under Lieutenant-Colonel Sir S. Hoare. This section has hitherto been respon-sible for: (a.) The collection of information and intelligence regarding the economic andtrade conditions of Russia; (6.) Matters relating to espionage, the granting of passports, &amp;c.; and (c.) Military intelligence regarding the distribution of enemy forces in the field,which it is now proposed to hand over to Colonel Knox.(5.) The British Propaganda Bureau, under Mr. Harold Williams, whose duties consist in providing information for the Prussian press regarding the activities of the Allies, and especially of Great Britain. Mr. Williams derives his material from a special branch of the Foreign Office created for this purpose, and clearly his activities come under the supervision of the Embassy.2- The Admiralty Staff, which consists of :-tl WJT Cc,ommod,0fe KemP, who is described as the Director of the Naval Defence of ie White Sea.   This officer is stationed at Archangel, and apparently does not confiue ins activities to the duties which have been entrusted to him, but has also assumed the ipervision of the naval transports arrangements at Archangel, and has consequently developed unpleasant relations with-[425] D
(2.) Captain Bevan, who is described as tbe Naval Transport Officer for fbe port of Archangel. This officer has under his control, during the navigation season, a large staff of about twenty-five naval officers who are charged with expediting the unloading of vessels at the port, and with keeping the Admiralty informed as to these operations. It appears that almost all these officers are unable to speak Russian, consequently their efficiency is greatly impaired.(-I) The naval transport officers at Kola, Vladivostock, and later on at Kern; also a senior officer at Kola, who is in command of H.M.S. &apos;* Glory.&quot;Transport officers.Bearing onmilitarypolicy.Position of Director of Transport.3. Proposed Staff of General Poole.General Poole&apos;s staff will include the following : (1.) Artillery Liaison Officers attached to the Russian armies in the field, who will be responsible for giving advice on all questions relating to artillery operations. Ee will also advise as to the formation of schools of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers of artillery and trench mortar units behind the lines.(2.) Liaison Officers attached to the different centres where batteries are assembled prior to their despatch to the front, such as Moscow and Tzarskoe. It will be the duty of these officers to arrange for, the formation of the Russian personnel to man the batteries immediately on their arrival, to assemble these batteries, and to expedite their departure to the front. They will be advised of all material which is forwarded to these centres from the ports, and will be able to notify General Poole of delays in delivery at the centres of assembly.(3.) Military Transport Officers at each of the ports, under a senior officer stationed at Petrograd. It would be their duty to expedite the forwarding of artillery, aeroplanes, and munitions from the ports to the points of &quot;assembly or to any other destination. They will also be charged with the collection of information regarding the daily shipments of material from the ports, and, in conjunction with the Russian officers, for supervising the loading arrangements of the waggons.(4.) A Munitions Officer, stationed at Petrograd, whose duty it will be to give advice regarding the manufacture of shells and other munitions in Russia, and who will also advise the authorities at home as to the available supply of raw material existing in Russia, and the amount, if any, -which should be sent to them by the Allies.(5.) An Officer in charge of Aeroplanes, who will be stationed at Moscow, where an aviation ground and sheds have been allotted to him.   He will be responsible ft receiving all British aeroplanes sent to Russia, assembling the planes, testing thei capacity, and finally despatching them in squadrons to the front.It is proposed that all these officers shall come directly under the supervision of General Poole, who will have direct access to the higher authorities on behalf of one or all of them.It will be seen from the above that two sets of officers, one naval and one military, are concerned with the questions affecting transport; the former with the shipping and unloading arrangements up to the point where the material is landed at high-water mark, the other with the railway arrangements and inland transport.   Tl Russian officials have consequently to deal Avith two sets of officers, all of whom ar engaged with expediting the passage of munitions.   Whether they happen to be naval or military officers they are all concerned with the same problem, that of supervising the transport.of material from its point of origin to its ultimate destination on the Russian front.    The French and British Governments, who have to decide tl) military policy for the conduct of the war, and have to further decide on what fron the munitions can best be utilised against the common enemy, are interested to knm that the munitions they send to Russia have actually arrived on the scene of operation-It does not matter to them whether these supplies are held up at Archangel, Moscow or any other intervening point.   Consequently the transport officer under General Poole should be responsible for all information&apos;regarding the movement of supplie from the date of the despatch from England or France until they eventually arrive at their destination on the Russian front.&quot; It would further be the duty of this officer to keep all the Departments concerned fully posted regarding the movements of al material and to urge the Russian authorities to expedite the transportation when cases of congestion or delay occur.   It would therefore appear desirable that all the navai and military officers engaged at the ports, and at any other points, should be under the direct supervision of a Director of Transport stationed at Petrograd, who woul1
199war.be attached to General Poole&apos;s staff. Further, that this officer should be the medium for information to all departments at home. He would be in a position 1o supply them with daily returns as to the movements of the supplies, which would enable them to regulate the despatch of vessels to Russian ports.In this connection the question of priority also arises. It will often be the case Priority, that certain kinds of munitions are urgently required for a particular military operation. General Poole, having access to the military chiefs both at the ports and in the field, will be able to ascertain their wishes in regard to this matter. He will then be able through the Transport Officer to convey this information to the proper authorities, both at home and at the Russian ports. Up to now the question of priority, in so far as it has been dealt with ar, all, has been settled by the Russian Committee at Onnada House, who apparently were not in a position to know what the pressing requirements were.It is also suggested that the shipment of exports from the Russian ports should Exports, also be dealt with by the Director of Transport, in closest co-operation with the French officials, who irive been charged with the duty of collecting supplies from the Russian Government. The problem of the import of munitions and the export of supplies is so closely connected that it is essential they should be dealt with by the same depart-nient in order to avoid friction at the ports.Conclusion.There is no doubt that the mission has done much good, and that it has brought the two countries into a closer alliance, and promoted a better understanding between the Allies.   Discussion helped to clear away misapprehension, and to pave the way for concerted action.   At the conclusion of the Conference the impression was that the atmosphere was much clearer, and that there was a more just appreciation on both sides of the problems which had to be faced and overcome.   It remains to be seen how far the decisions arrived at will be carried out by the Russian Government.   Much will depend upon the British and French officers who have been left behind, and who have been charged with the carrying out of the measures which have been agreed upon.   The officers to be attached to General Poole&apos;s staff should be carefully selected; selection of they should, if possible, be able to speak Russian and French, and they should know officers, their respective jobs thoroughly.   If we are really going to help the Russians, we cannot afford to send anyone who.is not first rate.   These officers must be backed up Support by the authorities at home, and every effort must be made to accede to their requests, from home. Their activities will be stultified if the Russians get the impression that the&apos;British authorities pay scant attention to the communications of their representatives.Similarly, only the best and most up-to-date material should be sent out.   It Material, is a gross nribtake to think that second-hand or inferior munitions can be palmed off on Russia.   An impression seemed to exist in some quarters that this is some-times done, and it is put forward as an excuse for the failure to utilise some of the material sent.After the war there is no doubt that the Germans will make strenuous efforts to Trade and regain the ascendancy in Russian trade which they have temporarilv lost, and it will rations he our business to make provision in time for.the development of our own trade, and to exercise sufficient influence upon the internal affairs of the country, so that the alliance between the two countries formed during the war may be strengthened and encouraged, and may result in lasting benefit to both countries.With a view to carrying out this policy it is suggested that every effort should be made as soon as possible to induce a large number of promising young men, who have had some commercial or business experience, to go out to Russia in order to learn tne language. For this purpose it might be advisable to enlist the services of partially disabled officers who have had to leave the army. When they have acquired a knowledge of the language they would be in a position to take up posts connected with the development of British trade. At the conclusion of war Russia will owe this country a huge sum of money, and it will be necessary to develop our trade relations, not only to deprive Germany of her hold and influence upon the Russian people, but also as a Wans of assisting in the. liquidation of the debt, inere is no doubt that Russia possesses immense possibilities of industrial develop-ment, and that with the extension of her railway system and the equipping of her ports there is ample room fir the growth of trade relations with Great Britain. The oundation of this trade reciprocity between the two countries should be laid before ie termination of the war.   Steps should be taken now to encourage preparation
for the investment of British capital in Russia after the war. Otherwise the Germans, through the organisations which they previously utilised, will step in again and resume their industrial superiority.The progress of the world in a large measure depends upon the planting of British ideas on Russian -soil, which will peacefully penetrate and influence all classes of Russian society, resulting in the growth of a new democracy imbued with the ideals of freedom and progress.All our efforts, whether they he military, political, commercial, or educational, should be directed towards achieving this great purpose.Summary of Conclusions.I. Provide funds to be at the disposal of our representatives in Russia.2. Insist on careful selection of officers to be sent to Russia; stress should he laid on the importance of their being able to converse in Russian and French.3. Arrange to send out suitable young men to acquire a knowledge of the Russian language, wdiose services can be utilised to promote British trade after the war.4 Enquire into the possibilities of using Dalny as a supplementary port to Yiadivostock.5. Press for the distribution of accumulated supplies at Vladivostock. 6. Restrict future imports at Vladivostock to railway supplies until the conges-tion is relieved.7. Press for completion and reconstruction of the Murman Railway and port of Kola, with a minimum capacity of 2,000 tons a day, before the 1st November.8. In the meantime regulate despatch of tonnage to Kola, in accordance with the capacity of the railway to handle the traffic.9. Press for restrictive and preventive measures to minimise the risk of explosions at the ports, particularly at Archangel and Kola.10. De.-.p itch as soon as possible all available rolling-stock. Hasten completion of contracts for rolling-stock.II. Create a separate transport section under General Pooie, with a Director of Transport at its head.12. Make the Director of Transport responsible for all transport arrangements in Russia, and place all the naval and military officers now7 engaged on this work under his supervision.13. Increase the number of Stokes and 2-inch trench mortars which have been promised.14 Instruct General Poole to make recommendations regarding priority in despatch of war material.15. Press the Russian Government to expedite the increase of supplies of raw material and fuel.   Strictly limit our contribution of metals.16. Create a sub-committee of War Cabinet to supervise and co-ordinate all war arrangements in connection with Russia.D. D.March 10, 1917.o
