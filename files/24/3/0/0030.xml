February 1917.SECRET.i 28ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT AND TRAINING OFDISABLED SOLDIERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions.1. BY arrangement with the War Office, disabled soldiers are to be retained in the appropriate military hospitals up to the limits of the available accommodation for so long as in-patient treatment is necessary whether by curative manual or other means.2. When, subject to the above, it has been decided by an Invaliding Medical Board that a man in hospital is no longer fit for service, the War Pensions Committee of the locality in which he intends to reside is to be informed of his approaching discharge, and, where out-patient treatment is recommended or curative training is advised, of the nature of that treatment or training, and full facilities are to be given to accredited persons to visit and confer with the hospital authorities and with the man on behalf of the Committee.3. The man is to be retained in the military hospital for a period of three weeks after the date on which his discharge is approved by the Invaliding Medical Board. He is then to be simultaneously discharged from the hospital and the army, and pass under the care of the War Pensions Committee of the locality in which he intends to reside, or, in certain cases, temporarily under the Committee of the locality in which he was treated before, and will continue to be treated after discharge.4. By the date of his discharge, any pension based on the man&apos;s disablement will have been permanently or conditionally awarded to him. Arrangements are being made for this award to be notified to the War Pensions Committee of the locality in which the man intends to reside, so that that Committee may be cognisant of every pensioner within their area.5. Officers in charge of military hospitals are being instructed to provide, so far as their available resources permit, out-patient treatment for all discharged soldiers presented to them for this purpose by the War Pensions Committee of the locality where the hospital is situate. This treatment will be provided either in the locality where the man intends to reside or in the hospital in which he was treated as an in-patient if that is considered better. Such will generally be the case if the in-patient treatment was in an orthopaedic or other special hospital.The arrangement with the military authorities will not, of course, preclude a discharged man being treated as an out-patient in any civil hospital if more convenient to the place of his residence, and if the War Pensions Committee of his locality are satisfied that he can get there the treatment necessary in his case.6. The War Pensions Committee of the locality in which the man is being treated will see to his maintenance and accommodation during this treatment. Provision has been made by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee for an allowance to enable the man to defray the cost of his maintenance and for separately maintaining his wife and family if his treatment involves his living away from home. With this provision, and a proposed article in the new Royal Warrant, which will make the addition, based on pre-war earnings to a man&apos;s minimum pension, dependent on his consenting to undergo such treatment as may be adjudged necessary for him, it is hoped to overcome the reluctance, which men not unnaturally feel when released from military discipline, to iorego their freedom of action, the chance offered by present circumstances of earning exceptional wages, and the pleasure of re-union with their families.[244-6] -    - B
7. War Pensions Committees can issue similar allowances to those mentioned above to men while undergoing treatment in convalescent homes or sanatoria after discharge, and can pay all fees in connection with such treatment.8. It not infrequently happens that a man discharged from the army and from hospital as no longer requiring in-patient treatment, after a time, again needs such treatment on account of wounds or disease due to his service. Arrangements have been made by which this treatment can, within three years of the date of the man being invalided out of the service and provided there is reasonable probability of the man&apos;s condition being cured or permanently improved by it, be given at a military hospital, the man receiving during its course pension for himself and his children as if totally disabled, subject to a hospital stoppage of Is. per day.9. The residential treatment of discharged soldiers is variously provided for according to their special disablements.The totally blind are dealt with by Sir A. Pearson&apos;s Committee at St. Dunstan&apos;s, Regents Park, and so long as this Institution is capable of dealing with all the cases, it is considered undesirable to establish any new institution for the treatment of blinded sailors and soldiers.10. Men whose limbs have been amputated are passed on from the Military Orthopaedic Hospitals, to Queen Mary&apos;s Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals at Roehampton (which has a subsiduary Brighton branch), at Glasgow, and at Bray near Dublin. Artificial limbs are made and fitted in these establishments, and men can return there or can send their limbs to be refitted at the public expense, if they get out of order, are destroyed, or become misfits. Other centres for repairs and re-fitments have recently been started, and the request of the St. John Ambulance Association to take part in this work is under consideration. Out of nearly 4,500 men discharged from Roehampton, up to the 31st December, 1016, three-fifths had been placed in new or had returned to their own employment, and the remainder, who refused to consider work, except in the vicinity of their own homes, had been passed on to the War Pensions Committees of the localities where these were situate.11. Paralysed men are sent to the Star and Garter Home, Richmond, established under the auspices of the Red Cross Society, or to subsidiary homes in Scotland and Ireland. Under the same auspices an institution, affiliated with the Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases, is being started at Golders Green for 100 discharged men suffering from Neurasthenia, and arrangements are being made for a large extension of the hospital of the National Society for the care of Epileptics, at Chalfont St. Giles. In these cases, it is proposed that the Red Cross Society, acting as agents of the Minister of Pensions should provide the buildings, and the maintenance of the patients in them, being assisted by a payment of 3s. per head per diem by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee.12. Arrangements proposed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee, and the Board of Control are under the consideration of the Minister of Pensions, by which discharged sailors and soldiers certified as lunatics will be treated in Asylums as &quot; service &quot; patients, and receive certain indulgences if their state of mind enables them to appreciate them.13. Arrangements have been made by the National Health Insurance Com-missioners, and are in operation, for securing that a soldier discharged as suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis or known at the time of discharge to be so suffering should, where the Military Hospital Authorities report residential treatment essential and the patient accepts, be admitted immediately to a sanatorium or hospital without being required to go on a waiting list and take his turn with the civilian patients awaiting residential treatment. It is now proposed to give a discharged soldier a second chance of accepting this preferential residential treatment within three months of his discharge, and also to bring every discharged tuberculous soldier under the notice of the Insurance Committee of his locality, and to give those Committees an inducement to get discharged men to avail themselves of the treatment at the stage at which it would be of most value, viz., within the first three months after discharge.It is under consideration to make provision for the residential treatment of incurable cases of tuberculosis under the arrangement with the Red Cross Society referred to above.14. Apart from the out-patient treatment referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, and to residential treatment dealt with in paragraphs 9 to 13, there remains general practitioner treatment. This is the Medical Benefit under the National Insurance Acts to which the great number of the disabled men are already entitled, and which will be extended to the small remainder.
It has been agreed with regard to Sickness Benefit under the National Insurance Act as modified by the amending Act of 1915, that the Approved Societies should be relieved of the additional expenditure that is falling on them solely on account of the war. The societies put forward a scheme by which whenever a disabled man claimed sickness or disablement benefit it should be decided whether his sickness or disable-ment was or was not due to his war service, his claim, paid in the first instance by his society, being recoverable or not recoverable from the Minister of Pensions, according to that decision. In place of this system, which would involve great difficulties in working, costly administration, and grave risk of unchecked malingering, an assessment of the proportion of - benefits which should be put down to war injuries, based on a comparison of payments to men over periods before and after disablement, has been suggested. This suggestion is now under consideration of the Approved Societies.15. The War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee have issued various instructions to Local War Pensions Committees with regard to making use for the re-education of the partially disabled of Polytechnics and Technical Institutes (of which thirteen in London and forty elsewhere in England, Wales, and Scotland, have offered technical and industrial classes), of voluntary centres, such as Lord Roberts&apos;s Memorial Workshops (of wrhich eight are running, employing some hundreds of maimed men), and of private employers, including farmers; A number of individual men have through the Local Committees received training in London and in some.; of the provincial towns, but the same difficulty-as exists in getting the men to submit to treatment, referred to in paragraph (j above, exists with regard to training. It is hoped to overcome it by the provisions of the Statutory Committee Regulation and the new Royal Warrant, mentioned in that paragraph, and by making a man&apos;s minimum pension independent of earning capacity and so unaffected by increased earning power.16. Under the auspices of the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee some twenty advisory boards consisting of representatives of Employers, Trade Unions, and Local War Pensions Committees, have been established to settle difficulties in assessing the wages of disabled men, and investigations have been made into the industries on which these men can most suitably be employed in different localities.17. A class of men not specially referred to in the foregoing paragraphs are those incapacitated by disease, &amp;c, to whom pensions have not been granted, the reason in the great majority of cases being that their incapacity was not caused nor aggravated by military service. When the new Royal Warrant takes effect it is proposed that these men should receive gratuities depending in each case on the extent to which the man is incapacitated from contributing to his own support, and the length and character of his service. The grant of this gratuity will be made dependent on the man undergoing treatment or training or both when deemed necessary.18. babies are annexed showing the total number of men who have been awarded pensions and whose claims to pension have been rejected up to the end of the year 1916, the principal injuries and diseases on account of which they have been discharged, and the numbers of artificial limbs and surgical appliances that have been provided or ordered for their use.February 5, 1917.[244-61B 2
