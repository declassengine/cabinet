SECRET.Report Revised to April 30, 1917.IN our original report, dated the 26th June. 1016, on the probable resources of Germany in personnel, we adopted the method of a &quot; balance-sheet &quot; of these resources, comparing the various heads under which the men of military age had been utilised or expended with an estimate of the total mobilizable population. Most of these estimates, however were necessarily of a doubtful character, and with the progress of the war the chances of error in this procedure automatically increase, while the independent evidence of growing depletion of reserves accumulates. We were, therefore, at first inclined to discard this method (as in the case of our revised report on Turkey), and to endeavour to form an opinion, from such indications as we could obtain of the lowness of the reserve of potential armed strength, how far it might still be possible for the enemy to supplement the forces serving in the field or training in the depots, the number of which is much more accurately known than any other element in the calculations presented in our first report. But it is obvious that, however strong the evidence of depletion of the potential military strength may be, it would still be insufficient to enable us to suggest a particular figure for any remaining untrained reserve.Partly for this reason and partly because of the interest and importance attaching to each of the items in a table showing utilisation of German personnel, it appeared to us that the conclusions arrived at from direct evidence of exhaustion of man-power must be supplemented and checked as far as possible by an attempt to estimate expendi-ture of personnel under various headings. We were, moreover, given to understand that a fresh estimate was desired of the number of men of military age still retained in industry in Germany, and especially in that of the supply of munitions of war, which it was thought might be approached from the point of view of British and French experience. We have, therefore, decided to present, as the principal feature of this report, as well-considered an estimate of the industrial position as we could form from a survey of the very unsatisfactory data at our command ; together with an estimate of the permanent casualties suifered to date by the enemy, the number of the forces in the field and in training, and other items leading up to a balance-sheet on the lines of our previous report. Although the conclusions arrived at appear to us reasonable we could not otherwise have put them forward we are obliged to add a warning that they should be regarded for the most part as estimates only, and that we attach more importance to the direct evidence of depletion of man-power to which we shall return at the conclusion of the present report.MALES OF MILITARY AGE IN GERMANY.By the end of 1916 the classes serving in Germany were those of 1889 to 1918 inclusive, le., men aged over 18 but under 48 at that date. From Table II of our previous report it may be seen that the total number of such males in Germany at this date (or rather on the Lst December, which is the more convenient date for calculation, being exactly six years after the last published census) would, under normal conditions and in the absence of migration since the census of 1910, have amounted to about 15,314,487. To obtain the numbers available for recruiting, this total has, as before, been diminished by the foreigners (taken at 51(5,643, see Table III of our previous report) and German emigrants (taken at 30,115) contained in it, and increased to allow for the return of Germans resident in Austria-Hungary at the outbreak of war (taken at 23,293).   The resultant totals at various ages are as follows : Class.191819171916-121911-071906-021901-18971896-921891-891918-1889Age.

men have in fact, of course, been called up. Their deaths are included amongst the estimated casualties, and unless allowance is made for them the method followed would result in counting such deaths twice over, first in arriving at the field for recruiting, and again in reckoning casualties. The total number of men called up has, of course, been increasing continuously since the commencement of the war, but if it be put at 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 as an average for the first two and a third years of war to the 1st December, and if the mortality of males aged 18-48, from whom invalids have been sifted by medical examination, be put at 5 per 1,000 living, the deaths in question would number 80,000 to 90,000. These men, having formed part of the recruitable population, but not being included in the figure of 14,801,000 arrived at above,mshould be added to it, bringing the total in round numbers to 14,900,000.In addition to classes 1889-1918, part of that of 1919, which was rather smaller than that of 1918, and may be esthnated to include a total of about 650,000 lads, is now (June) serving. It is convenient, however, to keep this class distinct, as the general standard of fitness for service cannot apply at this age, and the number available this year is taken at only 500,000.The question of recruiting for the German army from non-German sources should be referred to here. We do not think that any considerable numbers of men are thus obtainable. Presumably Poland would be the most important source of such recruits, and as to the numbers obtained in this quarter we have the statement of Polonia of the 20th May, 1917, that the Polish legions never numbered 30,000, and when handed over by the Austrians to the Germans in March last had dwindled to 10,000 men.ALLOWANCE FOR PHYSICAL UNFITNESS.We have been compelled, in view of information recently communicated to us concerning the progress of mobilization in France down to September 1916,* to make a substantial modification of the estimate under this head contained in our previous report. We there assumed that the proportion of men mobilized by France early in 1916, some 78 per cent, of the total population of military age, was limited mainly by physical unfitness for service. In doing so we had in mind recruiting experience in peace and in previous wars, which suggested that of men aged 18-48 some 20 to 25 per cent, would prove unfit for military service. From the new information, however, it appears that as the result of repeated revisions of the rejected men, their number had last autumn been reduced to 350,000 out of a total field of some 8,400,000, aged in this case 19 to 50, or less than 5 per cent. Evidently the efforts being made in this war are by no means to be inferred from previous ideas of what was possible, and we feel that it would be unsafe to rate the length to which Germany is prepared to go in passing men as fit for service by any lower standard than the effort of France, especially in view of the evidence from recent captures in favour of an extremely low standard of recruiting, and of the efforts now being made under the National Civilian Service Law and otherwise to place as many men as possible at the disposal of the military authorities.On this basis the number of men rejected as unfit in Germany, apart from class 1919, would be only about 620,000, and of these no doubt a considerable proportion may now be found amongst the number of men regarded as indispensable to war industry. The total, however, includes all the lunai ics, prison population, cripples, and complete invalids of these ages in Germany, and of the remainder there must be many who are neither skilled in nor adapted for any of the indispensable occupations. Making every allowance for the most advantageous utilisation of all possible labour from this source, we do not think it likely that more than 120,000 of these men can now be filling posts for which fitter men would otherwise have to be kept back from the army, and we* See report of Sir Arthur Lee on mobilization in Frauce to the Director-General of Recruiting, dated the 25th September, 1916.   The French figures may be epitomised as follows: French Males [Native and Naturalized) aged 19-50.				Number.	Per cent.	Army and Navj&apos; Munition workers Other exemptions Unfit...	(546,000	on April 1, 1917)	7,160,000 490,000 400,000 350,000	85-2 5-8 4-8 4-2		Total...	...	8,400,000	100-0Many men classed above as exempted are nominally in the army, as, for instance, railway servants, but are classed as exempted because employed on duties not regarded in this country as of a military nature.
therefore estimate the deduction from the total of German manhood on account of unfitness at 500,000, leaving any excess over this number to be reckoned amongst the men indispensable to industry.MEN NECESSARILY RETAINED IN CIVIL OCCUPATIONS.This number cannot be estimated with any approach to accuracy, as the circumstances of countries differ so widely that the practice of one cannot be inferred from that of another. Thus, as we have seen, the number of men kept out of the fighting forces as indispensable in civil occupations was under one million in France last autumn, whereas at a later date it was over four millions in Great Britain, with a population only slightly in excess of that of France. It appears to us unlikely that the proportion in Germany can either be as high as in Great Britain or as low as in France.Munitions.No doubt the principal occupations for which men have to be kept back from the army are those connected with the output and transport of munitions. In this connection the meaning to be attached to the term &quot; munitions &quot; should be narrow rather than wide, for such army stores as clothing, boots, and food, while they involve the activities of. large numbers of workers, yet represent rather the accentuation of a normal demand than the creation of a new one. Such stores are consumed by the civil as well as the military population, and civilians may well go without in order that the increased requirements of the army may be met. Consequently, even in a country like Germany, where the commodities have to be produced almost entirely at home, the total output is not necessarily increased to any great extent, and it may therefore be possible by dilution of labour to meet the increased demand of the military section of the populatioii without the aid of men of fighting age. We believe that, broadly speaking, this is the case in Germany, where the boot and clothing industries are much depressed by lack of raw material, and where by aid of foreign and especially prisoner labour it has been possible to cut down agricultural exemptions to a very low figure.The case is very different with the output of munitions proper, comprising mainly weapons and their ammunition, and including new plant required for their production, and so affecting especially the metal and chemical industries. Here the demand is for articles not produced at all during peace, or produced on a scale which is almost negligibly compared with the demands of w7ar. This enormously increased production involves the employment of certain types of craftsmen to such an extent that the demand cannot possibly be met either by men over military age (for their number is far too small) or by dilution with unskilled labour, for even when this has been carried to its utmost extent large numbers of skilled men are essential. Hence it comes that in France, where mobilization has been carried almost as far as would seem to be con-ceiyably p issible, more than half the total number of exempted men belong to this group of munition workers, and in this country the proportion is also very high. Here, how-ever, as in Germany, a class of worker has to be reckoned with which is only represented in minor degree in the French reservations that engaged upon the production of the raw material of munitions, chiefly coal and iron or steel. As these materials are largely or even mainly imported in the case of France, whereas in Germany and the United Kingdom they have to be almost entirely produced at home, with even some allowance for essential exports, it will be convenient to consider coal and steel production apart from that of finished munitions, in order that comparison with France may be facilitated.We have attempted to estimate the numbers of men required for munitions produc-tion in Germany by comparing the output of this country and of France with the numbers of total workers and of men of German military age employed, and then applying the ratios so established to the estimated munitions requirements of Germany. Many difficulties are met with in making a comparison of this nature, owing to the complexity of the products comprised under the term &quot; munitions,&quot; to the extent to which imported material is employed by the French and ourselves, and to the uncer-tainty as to German expenditure and requirements. It will be understood therefore that the results attained can only be regarded as very loose approximations.The comparative munitions activity, apart from coal and steel production, of Great Britain, France, and Germany, has been estimated by a method described in Appendix I, proportionate figures coming out at 152, 151, and 261 for the three countries respec-tively. In the case of Great Britain a large, and in that of France a considerable,, proportion of the total output represented by these figures is imported in a manufac-tured or semi-manufactured condition, whereas Germany is no doubt obliged to do [718-1] &apos; C     -
4tpractically all her own manufacturing for herself. An attempt is made in Appendix II to estimate the proportion of work done abi-oad in the munition supply of Great Britain and France. For this country the proportion may be taken as 40 per cent., with a considerable tendency &quot;to diminish, and for France at 17 per cent, In estimating the British proportion the very- considerable Canadian production has been treated as &quot; foreign,&quot; although the output dealt with is that for the armies of the Empire as a whole, because it is only for the United Kingdom that we have obtained the data as to numbers of persons employed.We have been provided by Professor Chapman, whose assistance in regard to this and other matters has been of great advantage to the Committee, with an estimate of the total number of workers engaged in the manufacture of munitions in the United Kingdom, apart from the production of steel billets and plates, &amp;c. This estimate, which has been prepared on the basis of returns furnished by employers to the Board of Trade, places the number of workers in January 1917 at about 1,600,000, of whom about 40 per cent, were males aged 18-48. Adding two-thirds to the total workers to represent the 40 per cent, of imported as against 60 per cent, of home-produced articles, the total number of workers employed on British munitions may be estimated at 2,666,000. If this number is increased in the proportion 152 : 261 to correspond with German production, the total estimated number engaged in Germany, apart from output for the navy and for the Allies, is about 4,580,000, of whom, if the proportion of males aged 18-48 were the same as in this country, about 1,830,000 would be males of military age. With additions for naval con-struction and munitions and for supplies to Allies the total might easily come to 2,000 000.This seems to us an outside figure for total males aged 18-48, for there is much reason to suppose that the output per worker may be greater in Germany than here, both on account of longer hours and less restriction of output, and probably also on account of more modern buildings and plant in Germany, and insistence on higher finish in British production. &apos; It has also to be borne in mind that the chemical and metal working plant for munitions production had to be newly created here to a larger degree than in Germany, and that our equipment of field and heavy guns has had to be provided since the outbreak of war to a much larger extent than in the case of either Germany or France. Moreover, the method of comparison employed in Appendix I. though the best at our command, is not by any means a strictly accurate one For cost is used as the measure of work done, and it may not be an accurate one in comparing production of large shell in which the cost of explosives is of maximum importance, with that of small shell, where explosives account for a smaller proportion of total cost. For this reason Great Britain, and still snore France, with their smaller proportion of heavy guns, may find it necessary to employ more labour in proportion to total ammunition output, as measured in terms of the 6-inch shell, than does Germany. In the case of coal and iron, where production can be easily compared with numbers employed, the output per worker is greater in Germany. Before the war each miner in Germany appears to have raised about 280 tons of coal per annum as against about 260 in England and Wales, but the difference appears to be greater for iron and steel production.As against these considerations there is abundant evidence from German sources of thereductiou of working capacity now caused by underfeeding, which has been variously estimated at from 25 to 50 per cent. Special measures have, it is true, been taken for nearly a year past to secure the nutrition of munition workers as far as possible, but the very fact of such measures being necessary is significant, and that they fall far short of complete success is proved by such a statement as that of the head of the Imperial Supply Office, quoted by Mr. Max Midler in his December 1916 Report, numbered 10806 (page 5), that from enquiries made in a large number of munition factories it had been ascertained that the efficiency of the workers had diminished by 30 per cent. On the other hand, we have the journal Die Konjunktur, of the 16th November, 1916 (quoted in the Board of Trade Economic Notes, No. 24, p. 29), speaking of &quot; classes of munition workers whose dietary is more liberal than in peace time, simply because the firms are in a position to spend large sums on special food supplies.&quot; This statement, however, is the only one of the kind known to us. as against many pointing to diminished working capacity from underfeeding, even of munition workers, miners, and shipyard workers.It may be, moreover, that the proportion to total workers of men of military age engaged in munition production in Germany is less than it was in Great Britain in January last, but it may be doubted whether this is the case, since the proportion of
females employed on munitions in Germany may be inferred from statements recently made by Dr. Helfferich to be 24 per cent, of total workers against 31 per cent, in thiscountry. ,For these reasons we do not consider it likely that the numoer of males ot military ao-e employed in the production of German munitions is as high as 2.000.000, and in any case they need not all be Germans. Prisoners and men from the occupied territories have undoubtedly been made to replace Germans as far as possible.^ The extent to which this replacement may have been carried is very difficult to estimate. In view of the number of substitutes available, we think it would be unsafe to assume that any unskilled men of German nationality have been retained in munition work; but the great bulk of the British--and so presumably of the German workers concerned are skilled men, for whom substitutes could hardly be forthcoming in anv great numbers from amongst the prisoner and deported populations, while it may be assumed that those obtained would take care to be as inefficient as possible. On the whole, we may perhaps say that the British analogy points to the retention of a number of German males of military age in the work of munitions production which may be as large as 1,500,000, and pass on to consider the matter in the light of French experience.The number of persons engaged in the manufacture of munitions in France on the 1st April, 1917, is stated by the French Ministry of Munitions to have been 1,567,357, comprising 538,951 men exempted from military service for the purpose, 663,795 civilians, and 364,611 females. The civilians include some men of military age, but unfit for service, who should be added to the exempted men to obtain the total number of Frenchmen of military age. In view of the strictness of French recruiting practice, which rejects less than 5 per cent, of the population as unfit for service, we do not suppose that the increase on this account can be very considerable. If we assume it to be 25.000, the proportion of total workers formed by Frenchmen of military age becomes 36 per cent., as against 40 per cent, for this country ; but for France an unstated but appreciable number of colonial natives and foreigners has to be added to obtain the total males of military age at work. It would seem, therefore, that the total cannot well be less than 600,000, and may be more. Taking it at this figure, it has to be increased as 83 : 100, or by about 20 per cent., to allow for the fact that some 17 per cent, of French munitions appear to be imported, taking payments made as the test of volume of output (see Appendix il). This proportion is based upon total expenditure up to the 30th April, 1917. arid may to some extent over-estimate the proportion now coming from abroad. Perhaps we may say that the present output of munitions for the French army involves the activity of 700,000 men of military age, and about 1,850,000 workers of all ages and both sexes. Increasing these numbers in the proportion 151 : 261, we obtain an estimate on the French analogy of about 1,200,000 men of military age and 3,200,000 workers for Germany, to which some addition must be made for naval munitions and supplies to Allied countries, but from which deduction has, on the other hand, to be made for prisoners and other foreign labour employed. Probably, therefore, we may regard the French analogy as pointing to the employment of about 1,000,000 Germans of military age on the production of munitions.In addition to estimation from British and French experience, it is possible from officially published German statistics alone to arrive at an approximate estimate of the number of males employed in the characteristic munitions industries in Germany, although, of course, not all of them will be actually engaged upon munitions. These figures, as well as a great deal of other useful information, have been furnished to us by Mr. Wotzel, of the Board of Trade, and the method of their employment (which is described in Appendix III) was suggested by him.From the data there considered we arrive at an estimate of 3f million workers, of both sexes and all ages, in the munition trades of Germany. In order to arrive at the probable number of munition workers included in this total, it has to be reduced to allow for a certain proportion of the normal metal-working industry, which must be maintained because essential to the national life. In Great Britain this proportion is believed to be about 18 per cent., and in Germany, which is not under the same necessity of maintaining exports, it should presumably be lower. If, to be on the safe side, we reduce it only to 15 per cent., the total number of Germans employed upon munitions comes out at 3,187,000--say, 3,200,000. If the proportion formed by men of military age is similar to that in France, say 38 per cent., or of men aged 18-48 in Great Britain, about 40 per cent., the men of military age employed upon munitions in Germany should number approximately 1  million.
The three estimates of total munition workers-on the British analog)&apos;, 4,580,000 ; on the French analogy, 3,200,000; and on the German data also 3,200,000-all presumably include prisoner and other foreign labour engaged on munitions, for, though the insurance figures for 1913, on which the estimate on Mr. Wotzefs lines is based, may be regarded as to all intents and purposes limited to persons of German nationality the foreign element during peace being comparatively small, there is no reason to suppose that newly-engaged foreign labour was excluded by the employers in making up their returns.We must now endeavour to estimate as best we may the proportion of these total workers formed by German males of military age, and here the difficulty&apos; of the task increases, for though a good deal of information is published as to changes in the total numbers of workers in certain industries and services, very little is afforded as to the proportion of these liable to military service. It will be convenient to consider first the cases of minei-s and of iron and steel workers.MinjNg, and Iron and Steel Production.It may be taken from the detailed statistics published of persons employed in Prussian mines (about 90 per cent, of the total) xhat the number so emplojed in Germany declined from 833,000 early in 1914 to about 625,000. in the fourth quarter of 1916, the latest period for which the returns are available, the number of coal and lignite miners being 713,000 at the earlier and 529,000 at the later date. This decline in numbers is consistent with what is known as to output, which fell, for coal only, from 191,511,154 tons in 1913, for the German Empire, to 146,712,350 tons in 1915, and, according to a statement in the Russian press, which we have not been able to verify from German sources, to about 134,000,000 tons in 1916. We know from German sources -that the capacit\^ per worker has been reduced by the withdrawal of man)&apos; of the best workers for service and the introduction of boys and old men, as well as probably by underfeeding; but that, on the other hand,the hours worked have increased, shifts of twelve hours being often worked. Moreover, it is very possible that attention is being con cent rated during the war upon the maximum immediate output of coal at the expense of future production. Perhaps, therefore, no great change in output per worker need be looked for, and it may be seen that the 1915 output at 280 tons per worker would require 524,000 Avorkers. According to the most recent Prussian statistics (those for the fourth quarter of 1916), the mine-workers in that country included 32,665 females, or about 6 per cent, of the total staff, the proposal made some time ago to employ them underground having been vetoed. It would follow that the males now employed in the whole of Germany should number about 587,000.In iron and steel manufacture we include blast furnace work, steel manufacture, and metal rolling, in which it is recorded in Stahl und Eisen that 370,000 males were employed in 1913. In 1916 pig-iron production was fairly steady at about 30 per cent., and steel production at 15 per cent., below the pre-war figure, according to monthly returns published up to and including October. The bulk of the workers being con-cerned with steel, the reduction for the whole group of men employed may be put at 20 per cent., bringing the total to 300,000 in round numbers.In the early months of the war great drafts were made upon both the miners and the iron and steel workers, and for a time production fell to a very low level. It seems to have soon been realised, however, that this state of affairs could not be allowed to continue, and, whether by bringing men back from the army, by employment of untrained German labour, or by the use of prisoner or other foreign labour, production was, by the end of 1915, restored to within measurable distance of its former level. Probably all three methods of renewing the staff of workpeople were resorted to. In so far as untrained German labour was introduced, this must have had the effect of reducing the proportion of men of military age, as such labour has largely consisted of youths old men and females. On the other hand, foreign labour would no doubt be almost exclusively of military age, and so its substitution for labour lost through enlistment would have little effect upon the age distribution of the men employed.It may be inferred from the January returns that the proportion of British coal-miners aged 18-48 was about 65 per cent, and of iron and steel workers about 60 per cent. We think it wise to assume that substitution may have been carried further in Germany than here, and to estimate that of the 587,000 miners 300,000, and of the 300,000 iron and steel workers 150,000, are of military age.
In the Westphalian coal area the output in November 1914 had been maintained at 55 to 60 per cent, of its extent before the war by the policy of the military authorities in refraining from calling the Landsturm to the colours in colliery districts. A little later, in February 1915, the Frankfurter Zeitung, speaking of the mining industry as brought at that time into a serious position by the war, said that the number of men withdrawn for military service was estimated at 40 per cent, of the total employed, and the consequent decline in output at 50 per cent. As the output was not allowed to continue long at this level, the production for 1915 in the whole of Germany having been 77 oer cent, of that for 1913, it may be assumed that, in one way or another, the shortage left by withdrawals for military service was reduced much below 40 per cent., and that the new-comers were not all men outside military age. The extent to which this shortage has been made good by the introduction of new adult male labour (over 16 years of age) may be determined from German official statistics, but not the proportion of these new men who are of military age.From a table published in the Reichsanzeiger of the 20th April, 1917, we find that the total number of male coal-miners in Prussia in the first quarter of 1914 was 650,058, and if 40 per cent, of these had been mobilized by February 1915 the losses to the army then stood at 260,000. As men aged 18-48 formed about 82 per cent, of all working coal-miners in Germany at the census of 1907, the number of military age must have amounted in early 1914 to about 533,000, so that withdrawal of 260,000 to the army must have left some 273,000 men of military age still in the industry, or 42 per cent, of the original peace strength. The total number of males employed in the fourth quarter of 1916, to which the most recent, returns refer, was 462,234, of whom the 273,000 men of military age left in the industry at the time of its greatest depletion would form 59 per cent. As boys under 16 at this time numbered 37,602, or 8 per cent, of the total male staff, the original staff over military age, together with new-comers, must have amounted to about 33 per cent, of the total. As the number of boys in early 1914 was 24,624, and of men of military age about 533,000, men over military age must at that time have numbered about 91,000, 14 per cent, of the total males then employed, but 20 per cent, of the reduced 1916 total. Newly-engaged men must therefore have formed about 13 per cent. (33 minus 20) of the total males working at the end of 1916.These facts may be summarized as follows, the figures representing proportions per cent, of the male staffs at the two periods : -   First Quarter, 1914.	Fourth Quarter, 1916.Men of military age mobilized by February 1915 ...         ...         ... &apos;       ...         ...    40 Men of military age not mobilized by February 1915 ...     &apos;   ...         ...         ...         ...    42 Men over military age     ...         ...         ...    14 Boys    ...         ...         ...         ...         ...      4 100	Men of military age on old staff     ...          ...     59 Men over military age on old staff ...         ...    20 Newly engaged men       ...         ...         ...     13 Boys   ...    &apos;    ...         ...         ...         ...      8 100On this basis the estimate that 300,000 out of the present 587,000 males in all the mines of Germany are of military age seems a very conservative one.,The number of foreigners employed in the mines and ironworks of Germany can only be guessed at. We think it likely that they may have been employed much more freely in the ironworks than in the mines, where the bulk of the work is of a nature demanding skill, and where an ignorant or hostile prisoner, not speaking the language, might well be a danger to the other workmen. For these reasons we deduct one-third irom the ironworkers to allow for foreign labour, but only one-sixth from the miners, reducing the figures for Germans of military age by 50,000 in each case, to 250,000 and 100,000 respectively.There is a certain amount of evidence that, although the use of prisoners in coal mines was commenced very early in the war, it has not been found possible subsequently to develop it to any great extent. The statement was made in the Neue Freie Presse of the 19th February, 1915, that the military authorities had placed 9,000 prisoners of war skilled in mining at the disposition of the Upper Silesian mining industry. In November 1915, on the other hand, we are told in the Berliner Borsen-Zeitung that prisoners of war had been introduced as far as possible into the Upper Silesian coal mines, hut-could not efficiently replace the skilled workers ; and in the Reichsanzeiqer-[718-1] D
of the 9th December, 1916, it was stated that as a consequence of larger numbers of unskilled workers having been taken on there were more than 12,000 Russian Poles employed in the coal mines of Upper Silesia alone. We know of no such explicit statements regarding the prisoner labour in other coal-fields, and think it likely therefore that this form of substitution has been carried further in Silesia thnn elsewhere. As the Upper Silesian field employs just one-fifth of the total coal-miners in Germany, the employment of 12,000 prisoners there may be taken to point to a total of about 50,000 in the whole country.It is true that the Beichsanzeiger statement is not inconsistent with the employ-ment of non-Polish prisoners in addition to the 12,000, but as the statement is made by way of explanation of a fall in output per worker owing to want of skill of the labour employed, we think it unlikely that any further appreciable use of prisoners, none of whom even if skilled could replace German workers man for man, would have remained unmentioned. The same consideration will perhaps serve to explain the reference to the 9,000 in February 1915 as skilled and to the 12,000 in December 1,9! 6 as unskilled workers. In the first article the object apparently was to &quot; write up &quot; the use being made of prisoners of war, so that the writers bias would be towards emphasising any skill possessed; wdiereas, in order to explain reduced output per worker, the second article was obliged to emphasise the lack of skill of these substitutes. On the whole, while recognising that the evidence is by no means decisive, we are disposed to think that at both dates the total number of prisoner workers is quoted, that increase of this number has been found difficult, and that the information as to the Upper Silesian field may be taken to confirm the estimate of 50,000 foreigners in the mines of Germany at which we had already arrived on general grounds. Further evidence of the limited possibilities of employment of prisoners of war in mines has just come to hand in the shape of a statement in the Berliner Tageblatt of the 10th May that the Rhenish-Westphalian mines are to be provided as quickly as possible with 19,000 miners from the army. This would not be done if prisoners could be used to obtain the increased output required.As to the estimates for both mining and iron and steel production we believe that, whatever opinion may be held -as to the allowance for foreign labour, our estimate of total male labour of military age is a conservative one. At 50 to 53 per cent, of total male labour, it is well below the standard so far attained in this country, and it is also below the estimate in a memorandum on German man-power prepared in January 1917 for the Russian Ministry of Trade and Industry, that the proportion of insured male workers of military age in Germany is now about 55 per cent. This estimate, derived from certain sickness insurance statistics, is not indeed of great importance, but it is, of course, to be expected that the proportion of men in the prime of life would be higher in the coal and iron industries than in industry generally, to which the Russian fioure applies. Also we may refer to the exceptionally high proportion of labour of military age remaining in the one industry for which statistics on this point are available the railways (page 10.)Munitions (continued).We are now in a position to return to the consideration of the probable number of German males of military age included amongst the total of 3,200,000 munition workers deduced from, the German statistics. Fairly definite statements recently made by Dr. Hellferich as to the proportions of females now employed throw light upon this matter. In the iron, steel, and other metal trades (exclusive of mining) he stated that 19 per cent, of females were emploj^ed, as also in mechanical engineering, while in electrical engineering the proportion was 55 per cent., and in the chemical trades 23 per cent. We have seen that in mining the proportion is only about 6 per cent., and we may perhaps put the iron and steel production proportion at the same figme, both being industries little suited to women. We have estimated females engaged in mining in Germany at the Prussian proportion of 6 per cent, of 625,000, or 37,000, and as males in iron and steel production have been taken at 300,000, females in this industry, if 6 per cent, of the total, would number about 19,000. Hence, of the females in the metal trades (group 1 of Appendix III, total workers, 3,415,000, less mining, 6-5,000), who at 19 per cent, of 2,790,000 would number about 539,000, 19,000 are not munition workers, the remaining 520.000 being so classifiable. Women in the second group, Appendix III, mechanical engineering, may be taken at 19 per cent, of 582,000, or 110,000; in the third group, electrical engineering, at 55 per cent, of 391,000, or 215,000 ; and in fourth group, chemical industry, at 28 per cent, of 277,000, or 64,000. Thus the total number of females at work in the munition trades comes out at 909,000, or 24*3 per cent of the-total of 3,740,000 workers in these trades.   If the same pro-
portion holds good for the workers actually engaged on munitions production, whom we have taken atli^OO^OO, the mules among them should number about 2,422,000.The proportion of males in the munition trades in Great Britain in January last who were of Germany military age is estimated to have been about 57 per cent., but in Germany it may wen be lower, both on account of larger dilution with foreign labour and of the higher limit of military age. On the other hand, dilution with female labour appears to be less than in this country (24*3 per cent, for the munition trades as a whole, against 31*2 per cent, here and 23&apos;3 per cent, in France), and the great bulk of necessary exemptions-in these trades in this country are on account of the skill of the workmen, and*not, as in mining and iron production, very largely on account of the laborious nature of the work, so that foreign labour could not be utilised to the same extent. As to this we may quote the following extract from an article contributed to the Berliner Tageblatt of the 1.5th June, 1916 : &quot; Thousands and thousands of skilled Belgian and Polish workmen from the occupied territories have crowded into Dusseldorf and its neighbourhood; and in addition there are numbers of prisoners of war, who, however, are only utilisable for quite rough work.&quot;On the whole, we think that reduction of the British proportion of men aged 18-48 to 50 per cent, of total males employed is reasonable in this case also, although the reduction involved by this figure is not so great as for miners and ironworkers. Total male workers being taken at 2,422,000, those of military age would on these lines number 1,211,000, or just a little less than the l  million deduced (see p. 5) from application to the estimated number of total workers of the British and French proportions of males of (French or German) military age employed.This figure, however, includes men working for the navy, who have been excluded from the munitions groups in our calculations based on British and- French experience. The number of such men at the present time is estimated by the Admiralty at 100,000, of whom it is thought 50,000 or rather less may be of military age. Deduction of naval labour therefore reduces the estimate to just over 1,150,000.We have now obtained estimates by three different methods of the number of men of military age engaged upon munition production in Germany.   These are On the British analogy        ... ...   1,860,000, including foreigners.,,    French    ,, * ... ...   1/200,000,,    German statistics, barely        ...   1,150,000 ,,It is to be remarked in regard to the third estimate, that it is fairly evident from the text accompanying the figures upon which it is based that the German Department of Labour Statistics desires to represent the state of employment in the various industries reported upon in as favourable a light as possible, and that there may, there-fore, be some tendency to over-statement of numbers employed, which might be brought about, for instance, by bias in selection of the firms compared. On the whole, therefore, on consideration of the three estimates jointly, we are disposed to think that the number of male Germans aged i 8-48 engaged upon the production of munitions may be approximately 1,000,000, or, including coal and iron production, taken as employing 350,000 more, 1,350,000.Railways.The exemptions in this group probably rank in importance second only to those of munition workers. Fortunately we have more definite statements from German official sources as to their number than in any other case.The Prussian Minister of Railways stated in the Diet in March 1915 that out of some 600,000 men on the staff of the Prussian railways 80,000 to 90,000 had been called to the colours, partly for combatant duties and partly for railway service in the occupied territories. On the 24th October, 1916, it was stated in the Reichstag by the Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Public Works that 150,000 employees of the Prussian-Hessian State railways had been mobilized. Their places had only partly been filled up, amongst the substitutes being 45.000 women. It is to be noted that this figure relates to a date subsequent to the additional mobilization secured by Hindenburg in the late summer of 1916, and probably therefore represents approxi-mately the state of affairs at the present time, for there is abundant evidence that the railways are now in no condition to stand further depletion of men. The demands upon them have been enormous, and although renewals of rolling-stock were even in 1916 in excess of peace standards, 2,000 heavy locomotives having been built in the first half of
1916, the State railways were, according, to the Lokal-Anzeiger of the 26th November, 1916, in a very dangerous condition\at that date, owing to lack of supplies and of workshop labour for repairs. In confirmation of this we have the facts that the Government has recently appropriated the enormous sum of 482,000,000 M., far in excess of any previous record, for railway purposes ; and that the Prussian Minister of Railways has recently referred to the return of expert hands from the front to fill up the gaps in personnel, especially in the repairing workshops.It is stated, in a recently published, report on the Prussian State Railways for 1915, that the average number of employees during that year was 534,249, of whom 22,703 were women. These figures, it wall be seen, are quite consistent with the Ministerial statements quoted above. The number of employees of these railways insured against infirmity on the 1st January, 1916, is stated to have been 449,440, and from a statement of the ages of these persons it may be calculated that 8T2 per cent, of them were between 18 and 48. We are wdthout a statement of the total number of substitutes replacing the 150,000 mobilized last October; but as the 45,000 women in the service at that date would bring the numbers up to about 500,000, and as other substitutes are referred to, it may perhaps be assumed that the staff still remains much at its average figure for 191.5, 534,249, the males in that case being approximately 490,000. It would probably be unsafe to assume that the proportion of military age has remained at the very high figure of 81 &quot;2 per cent., as substitution since the beginning of 1916 will presumably have decreased this ratio, but if we assume 75 per cent, as the proportion at the present time we may take it that the Prussian State railways now employ about 368,000 men of military age.ISo corresponding figures are available for the other German railways, but as their mileage is just about half that of the Prussian lines, and as they also serve very important industrial areas, their staff also may be taken as half that of the Prussian lines. On that assumption the total male railway staff of militaiy age may be estimated at 550,000. This number may include some foreigners, though the opportunities of using the labour of prisoners, &amp;c, would be comparatively few. To allow for the possibility, however, we prefer to estimate the number of German males of military age employed at half a million. -Other Reservations.The industries so far dealt with have been estimated to entail the employment of almost 2,000,000 German males of military age, made up as follows :  Munitions        ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   1,000,000Coal and iron production ... ... ... ... ... ...     350,000Railways ... ... ... ... ... ... ...     500,000Total ... ... ... ... ... ...   1,850,000It is scarcely possible to deal with other reservations in similar detail, as the necessary data are not available. It must therefore suffice to enumerate some of the more important purposes for which additional exemptions may be supposed to exist, to indicate the nature of such information as is available in each case, and to endeavour to fix the aggregate of their requirements at a reasonable figure.Transport.Probably the most important single heading is transport, other than railways. The number of men employed on tramway, road, and water transport, including both inland navigation and the Baltic trade, must be very considerable. Unfortunately, information on this point cannot be obtained from the German census, which enumerates transport workers, other than those employed by transportation businesses, under the industry employing them. If, however, we turn to the English census in order to obtain some idea of the relative numbers in various classes of transportation work we find that,, excluding marine and dock employment as in the main inapplicable to Germany&apos;s present circumstances, male transport workers in 1911 numbered 1,172,016, of whom 397,990, or only 34 per cent., were railwaymen. We have seen that railwaymen in Germany were before the war at least double the English figure, and that 500,000 of them are probably exempted from military service. If we assume that other transport workers bear somewhat the same ratio to&quot; railwaymen in Germany as in England, there must have been over 1,500,000 of them before the war of whom more than 1,000,000 would be of military age. The question remains, how many of these are likely to have been retained as indispensable ?We have not been able to obtain the corresponding numbers for Great Britain, as
the Board of Trade estimates of the state of employment in January, like the German census, distinguish only such transport workers as happen to be employed by transportation firms. The numbers of military age retained, however, are known to be very considerable, notwithstanding earnest attempts to cut down protection to the lowest limit admissible. Thus of 256,000 &quot; public carriers,&quot; the largest group other than railwaymen in the Board of Trade figures, 371 per cent., or a little less than half the proportion of all road transport workers who were of German military age at the census, are returned as having joined the forces.On the other hand, reservations of this type of labour, as of practically all others except for munitions and railways, are very small indeed in France. But we believe that the situation in Germany, which has to maintain her industry to&apos; the extent at least of being self-supporting and of providing on a moderate scale for the maintenance of the mark exchange by means of exports, must in regard to her requirements for transport resemble that of Great Britain rather than that of France, and on these general grounds we believe that transport workers must have been kept out of the army in considerable numbers, which we have no means of estimating, but which might easily amount to 200,000 or more.We may refer here to inland navigation, a much more important branch of transport in Germany than in this country. Owing to the size of the barges, &amp;c, employed in this service in Germany, men of both strength and experience must be essential for it. The German census states the numbers concerned (i.e., those employed by transportation firms only) at 53,000 men in 1907, of whom 40,000 were of military age, so the total numbers must be large. It is evident that water transport has been pushed as far as possible during the war to relieve the railways, and the number of men employed may well be as large or larger than in peace. Thus we are informed that the traffic on the Bhine-Herne canal, opened in 1914, has doubled expectations, and that the figures, which increased regularly month by month till July 1916, &quot; increased afterwards by leaps and bounds, i.e., after the new Hindenburg levies had further depleted the railways of men, and the Roumanian campaign had increased munitions requirements. It is evident that if an industry is to be maintained in this fashion it must retain many men from military service. The workers in this, as in certain other forms of transport (trams and shipping), are exempted from the operation of the National Civilian Service Law, a fact which shows the view taken of the importance of the industry, but does not in itself prove that its men of military age have been spared, for the same applies to agriculture, in which there have been few exemptions.We are informed by the Admiralty that a &quot;considerable number&quot; of naval reservists have been exempted for the shipping trade with Scandinavia and in the Baltic, but no doubt the chief demand for transport workers, other than railwaymen, is on the roads.The cartage of heavy goods, such as is required especially in ports and manufacturing centres, demands both strength and skill, and it is not always possible to replace this labour by that of men 50 years of age and upwards, unaccustomed to the type of goods handled, even though competent to manage horses. Such has been the experience in this country, and the difficulty must have been far greater in Germany owing to the higher limit of military age. Moreover, owing to the under-feeding both of men and horses (which were on a ration of 3 lbs. of oats per day last summer, since increased owing to its utter inadequacy to 4^ lbs.), the number of workers required must be much increased in proportion to the work done. Certain it is at all events that road transport had been reduced to a level by last winter below which it could scarcely be allowed to fall. Thus the Lokal-Anzeiger of the 19th&apos; January attributes the distressing lack of fuel in the towns to shortage of &quot; railway trucks, coal-heavers, and horses for cartage,&quot; while in March the Vossisehe Zeitung stated that the price of a pair of good draught horses had gone up from about 3,000 M. before the war to 10,000 M. to 11,000 M. Wages of porters had more than doubled, and even so, the men could not do half the work they did under normal conditions. It does not seem likely that the army can obtain many more recruits from road transport.In the tramway service there would appear to have been few exemptions granted, if the statement of the Vossische Zeitung of the 16th January, 1917, that the Berlin tramways had then only about 1,200 of their old staff (7,000 strong) left, is to be accepted. Women have been employed both as drivers and conductors, but are constantly leaving, the average stay being three months. As a consequence no doubt of this difficulty notices were sent by the company in February to the wives of their mobilized employees (to whom two-thirds wages are paid by the company) requiring wonie] i capable of work to report for duty, a policy endorsed by the War Department, but criticised as the first step towards industrial conscription for women by the Berliner Tageblatt, which reports it.[718-1] E
Shipbuilding.We have already referred to the British Admiralty estimate that the number of men of military age employed in dockyards and elsewhere on the upkeep of the German navy is about 50,000. Apart from these men, we think that no exemptions for ship-building should be assumed, as the evidence regarding the extent to which mercantile shipbuilding is being carried on is most contradictory and confusing; and even if the accounts of large production be accepted, it is obvious that men so employed could at any time be diverted to military service without diminishing the power of the nation to hold on, and should therefore be regarded as forming a military reserve.As to the contradictory nature of the evidence, it will suffice to quote two state-ments by Herr Ballin. In Mr. Max Muller&apos;s notes on the economic situation in Germany in October 1916, when detailed accounts of extensive mercantile shipbuilding-programmes in hand were being circulated by the German -newspapers, he is quoted as having stated in a recent interview that, as soon as the war began, work on all large liners was suspended, as all hands were required for navy work, and that all that was being done at the time was to make arrangements for a prompt resumption of work on the mercantile marine directly the war was over. On the other hand, in another inter-view in the Neue Freie Presse, quoted in the Daily Chronicle of the 5th April, 1917, he gave particulars of a very large shipbuilding programme actually in hand. This conflict of evidence will serve to illustrate the difficulty of the attempt to elucidate the German industrial situation from the information afforded to us by Germany.Post Office.The Kreuz-Zeitung of the 18th May, 1916, reported that in the course of the previous day&apos;s Reichstag debate it was stated by the Postmaster-General that of a total of 220,000 male officials in the service 97,000 were actually in the field. As men aged 18-50 formed 87 per cent, of total males in the service at the census of 1907, their number to correspond with the 220,000 total males would be 191,400. It seems probable that if only just over 50 per cent, of this number had been released by May 1916 the permanent retention of a considerable proportion would be necessary, even when dilution had been carried to its fullest extent. If wc take that proportion at somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent., we arrive at a necessary reservation of over 50,000 men, for the staffs in Bavaria and Wurttemberg, which are outside the Imperial system, add about 10 per cent, to the 220,000 men noted.Even though further limitations of the post and telegraph service have been intro-duced since May 1916, as described, for instance., from an official source, in the Vossische Zeitung of the 29th November, 1916, the above estimate appears very moderate in view of the French reservation in September 1916 of 29,200 men fit for service for postal and telegraph work, at a time when total reservations in France were on the scale indicated on page 2, and of the number reserved in this country, which is estimated to have been about 41,000 in January 1917. The number at German military age would of course be considerably greater.New Processes.Apart from the munitions industries, processes, either of an entirely novel nature, such as the production of artificial fodder from straw, for which special machinery is required, as well as from other novel materials, and of food substitutes generally, the extraction of fat from maize and other unaccustomed sources, and the preparation of textile fabrics from bulrushes, nettles, &amp;c. ; or not formerly operated in Germany on the scale now required, such as nitrate and saccharine production, bauxite mining (for aluminium, the ore having been previously imported from France), and oil extraction in the Roumanian oilfields, must in the aggregate require the reservation of an appreciable number of men. Men of the type required by the industry which has to be created or extended under the stress of blockade must in many cases be so few in number that any there are have to be kept back from the army. The production of machinery and plant for such new processes may also be a matter of importance. Whatever the demand for men under this head may be it is something additional to the demand in the countries with which Germany is at war.Agriculture.In all probability very few exemptions have been granted to agricultural workers. The Russian staff report already quoted makes this assertion emphatically, quoting in support of it actual instances of the drain on the population of agricultural districts  from the Deutsche Tageszeitung of the 18th November, 1916; and Mr. Curtin, the special correspondent of the Times, is of the same opinion, as the result of investigations n the German rural districts (Times, 15th December, 1916).   Moreover, all the
published information from German sources points in the same direction, as for instance Batocki&apos;s statement in the Reichstag on the 4th November, 1916, that agricultural enlistment had not gone so far in some hostile countries as in Germany, and the fact that the men who would naturally be taken last, the farmers themselves, are serving in very large numbers, their wives being left to carry on as best they may. Nevertheless, agriculture is such an important industry in Germany, employing as it does about one-quarter of all the occupied males (and fully half the occupied females), that it is desirable to consider its relationship to other occupational demands, and the prospect, if any, of necessity arising for the return of agricultural workers from the colours.The loss of practically its whole male labour force of military age has been as far as possible made good to German agriculture from the following sources, but their combined effectiveness evidently leaves much to be desired: 1. Prisoners of war.2. Russian harvesters in the country at the outbreak of war. 3. Deported labour from the occupied territories. 4. Women and girls 5. Boj-s.6. Soldiers temporarily assigned to agricultural duty, particularly convalescentsand men tit for garrison duty only. 7. The general public (obliged to work at harvest time).1. Prisoners : Great use has been made of prisoners, probably all that can be made. In June 1916 the number at work on the land was estimated by Dr. Michaelis at 750,000 (Berliner Tageblatt, 2lst June), and in February last it was stated in the Diet by the Prussian Minister of Agriculture to be 758,000. Apparently both statements refer to Prussia only, and if so, as the number of prisoners in Germany, according to a statement published in Vienna in May 1917, was 1,690.731, over half the total seems to be employed in agriculture, and this number would appear to have been stationary for many months past, probably from the want of opportunity to increase it. It is, however, not.certain that the statement quoted from Michaelis either applied to Prussia only or was correct when made it was only put forward as a rough estimate  for the Russian staff report quotes a memorandum presented to the JReichstag in March 1916 as returning the prisoners of war employed on agriculture in Prussia at that date at 339,000. However this may be, their labour is relatively ineffective. A German employer, C. H. Ziese, emoted in the Russian staff report, states in a special article on prisoner of war labour that in the early days of the \\ ar five Russian prisoners did the work of three Germans, but now (September 1916) do the work of two only. That this low output is not always due to underfeeding would seem to follow from the dietary described by an escaped Canadian soldier, as quoted by Mr. Max Muller in his report for March.   He said he was stuffed with food to enable him to work better.2. Russian harvesters : These are believed to form a large body of men, but we have been unable to obtain any definite information as to their number, which is estimated by Curtin, on the strength of his personal investigations in rural Germany, at almost a million. We naturally hoped to get some information on this point from the Russian staff report, but were disappointed to find that it estimates the number of all enemy subjects interned in Germany at the commencement of the war from the numbers enumerated at the census, although this, taken in Germany on the 1st December, must naturally exclude foreign harvesters.3. Deported labour from the occupied territories : The largest source of supply would naturally be the extensive agricultural districts in Poland, and Western Russia now in German hands. But the authors of the Russian staff report consider that the limited number of men left in the country at the date of its occupation is required by the Germans for work on their own lands, so that few could be spared for German agriculture. This opinion is confirmed by the figures quoted for the Polish legions on page 2, and by a statement of the Polish Press Bureau, quoted in a Reuter despatch of the 12th June, that the Governor-General at Warsaw has suspended all recruiting for the Polish army owing to the scarcity of labour for the harvest. Presumably this difficulty applies to Serbia and Roumania also. The Belgian authorities believe that about 100,000 Belgian subjects have so far been deported, the majority of whom would probably be used for other than agricultural work. On the other hand the Prussian Minister of Agriculture, in an order to all Chambers of Agriculture, dated the 30th December, 1916, states that he has asked the War Department that so far as it is found possible to bring workers fit .for field labour to Germany from the occupied territories they may be set to farm work.   From this statement
t appears that further steps in this direction were in contemplation at the end of the year, and that some importance was attributed to this source of supply. It may be added that the French Government believe that the number of men obtained from the French occupied territories is small.4. Women and Girls : These were already very largely employed in German agriculture in peace time (4f million women to 5 million men at last census), and it is hard to say how far this employment has been extended. Where all the countrywomen available were already working such extension would involve migration of townswomen to the country, and the Russian staff report, on the strength of some very unsatis-factory sickness insurance figures, believes that this has occurred to a large extent. Dr. Helfferich&apos;s figures of the percentage of women employed in November 1916, already quoted on page 8 for metal industries, show that the proportion in agriculture has grown from 32 per cent, in July 1914 to 45 per cent., but this may be due either to increase in the number of women or decrease in that of men. Considerable pressure appears to have been exercised to induce women to take up farm work, if one may judge from a circular of the Prussian Minister of the Interior as to the arrangements for the harvest of 1916. An urgent appeal was made for help from unemployed women in rural districts, and special pressure was to be exercised in the case of women in receipt of family allowances by threat to reduce the allowance. The steps taken, however, do not appear to have had the full effect desired, for we are told that while the National Civilian Service Law has produced an overwhelming rush of women to particular occupations, there is in other occupations, and especially in agriculture, an appreciable shortage of labour. It may be noted, however, that the occupations to which the rush has occurred do not seem to include those concerned in munitions production, for the War Bureau of the Prussian Ministry of War is publishing a special appeal for women munition workers, in which it states that &quot; a great increase of the number of women in munition factories is needed,at present.&quot; There is, indeed, a good deal of evidence latterly that women workers generally are not forthcoming in the numbers desired.5. Boys : Mr. Max Muller&apos;s report for March mentions that great efforts are being made to enlist boy labour on lines not far removed from compulsion. Throughout the Rhenish provinces, for instance, companies under military discipline have been formed of boys from 14 to 17 years of age to work in the fields.6. Soldiers : Soldiers have been temporarily assigned to agricultural duty, as in other belligerent countries, especially at seed time and harvest. &quot; Agricultural aid columns &quot; appear to have been formed this year of men fit only for garrison duty and of convalescent soldiers, but farmers have been warned that soldiers cannot be allowed to assist them to the same extent this year as last owing to military requirements.7. The General Public : In some parts of Germany at all events compulsion has been applied to the public in general in order to secure their services at harvest, as shown by the following quotation from the Vossische Zeitung of the 19th October, 1916 :-&quot; The Commander of the XVIIth Army Corps District (Dantzig) has taken exemplary measures for assisting the lifting of the potato crop.   He has issued orders that all persons in accordance with their station, their powers, and skill, are obliged, on request, and so far as their special circumstance permit, to give assistance in all agricultural operations in the area of their residence.&quot; It thus appears that the principle of industrial conscription was already in operation in Germany to some extent even before the passing of the National Civilian Service Law.   The extent of its application was apparently at the discretion of the local military authorities, a demand for universal compulsory labour for agriculture made about this time in the Reichstag Budget Committee by the Centre party having been rejected.There is abundant evidence from German sources that all these supplies of substitutes have by no means sufficed to make good to agriculture its loss of labour to the army, and we therefore cannot accept the opinion expressed in the Russian staff report that they have almost sufficed to fill up the gaps so caused. Discussions of harvest prospects in Germany commonly refer to lack of labour and fertilisers, some-times with the addition of draught animals as well, as the great difficulties to be met. Confining ourselves to Ministerial utterances on this point, we may quote first the Prussian Minister of Agriculture, who stated about December last that mobilization for the army had then gone so far that it was no longer possible to find substitutes, and the situation was not likely to be improved by the new Auxiliary Service Law, as the provision that men were not to be compulsorily assigned to lower paid work must
make it impossible, as a rule, to transfer industrial workers to the land. Agriculture would therefore continue to be dependent upon men released from the army, prisoners of war and women. In the Reichstag, on the 12th October, 1916, Herr von Batocki, President of the War Food Department, attributed the then existing shortage of potatoes partly to bad weather and partly to shortage of horses and men; and in December an article communicated by the War Food Department stated that, &quot; not-withstanding the shortage of workpeople and of horses, German agriculturists managed to cultivate a larger area of potatoes in 1916 than in 1915.&quot; Perhaps the strongest statement, however, is that of the Prussian Minister of Agriculture before the Budget Committee of the Diet on the 19th February, 1917, that agriculture was short of hands by hundreds of thousands, and that he had urgently requested the granting of leave to agricultural labourers, as the further release of mobilized men was necessary to make possible in adequate measure the spring sowing. In view of such a statement as this by the responsible Minister, and of the vital importance of agricultural production to Germany, it is very significant of the present position in regard to military reserves that farmers have, as already stated, been warned to look for less military assistance in this than in former years.Finally, in an announcement in the Vossische Zeitung of the 2nd March, 1917, which has every appearance of being an official circular, we are told that the first dominating principle in the assignment of national service men will be that &quot; agricultural work comes first,&quot; and only after it the provision of substitutes to set free men of military aae for the front and as skilled workers. .The Government is in fact faced, as elsewhere, by two imperious demands for men, for the land and for the army, and it is probable that policy has varied somewhat from time to time as one or other demand temporarily gained the upper hand. Thus, although there is evidence that so recently as November 1916 agricultural labour was still being conscripted (&quot;the number of farms that have lost their masters grows daily&quot; - Batocki in the Reichstag on the 4th November), indications of the converse policy of recall from the colours began to appear about the beginning of the present year. The Order of the Prussian Minister of Agriculture of the 30th December, 1916, already quoted, states that the War Department has agreed that agricultural foremen, also engine attendants, metal-workers, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights, for whom no substitutes can be fotfnd, shall, so far as possible, be recalled from the front. In January the establishment, of a &quot;war agricultural office &quot; in each Prussian province was announced, amongst whose functions first place is given to the provision, and where necessary exemption from military service, of managers of estates and agricultural labourers.The latest swing of the pendulum appears to have been in the opposite direction, as indicated by the circular warning farmers to count on less military labour in 1917, but it seems to us possible that the agricultural position may become so threatening that, in spite of all the efforts made to obtain labour from other sources, a significant number of men may have to be.recalled from the colours for the purpose. The demand for labour is increased owing .to the fact, of which there is abundant evidence, that owing to lack of fertilisers and draught animals milch cows were being put to this use in March in some areas and increase of weeds, production per worker must have fallen considerably. Up to the present, however, agricultural exemptions are probably not numerous.Fishing.It seems to us probable that, as is believed by the Admiralty and as Mr. Curtin suggests in his Times article, considerable numbers of fishermen have been exempted from naval or military service. The importance of the Baltic fisheries to Germany must be very great, and these cannot be carried on entirely by old men and bovs. In a report published in the Frankfurter Zeitung of the 23rd August, 1916, the statement was made that &quot; the forthcoming winter season for herrings, sprats, and mackerel is likely to produce the same brilliant results as last year&apos;s.&quot; The catch of herrings in August off the Mecklenbutgh and Pomeranian coasts was exceptionally large. This result could hardly have been attained without considerable reservations from military service. The Lokal-Anzeiger of the 17th December, 1916, published an article in which the shortage of fresh-water fish, a more important food in Germany than in this country, is attributed to mobilization of skdled workers at the outbreak of war, unskilled labour being of no value in the fishing industry. If this contention is correct^ shortage of food may compel exemption of fresh-water fishermen also.[718-1] F
Professions.There is probably an appreciable number of reservations to be allowed for under this head. The Russian Staff report, grouping the professions and administration together, estimates that of the half million men of military age in the group not more than 100,000-150,000 have been called up for service, decrease in the number of professional men having been accompanied by increase in that of officials. Little German information on the subject has come to our notice, but we are told that, in August 1915, 1,000 out of 3,000 members of the Berlin Architects&apos; Association were taking part in the war. The demand for architects must have been reduced to a low level by that time, and the fact that when mobilization had been carried so far as it had been at the end of the first year of war only one-third of the architects were serving suggests that professional men have not been severely dealt with. It seems also that the proportion of students for the professions who are serving is lower than in this country, as the Prussian Minister for Education is quoted in Vorwarts of the 31st January, 1917, as having stated in debate in the Diet that there were 6,968 native male students actually at the Prussian Universities out of a total of 28.000 native male students registered.In the same debate the Minister of Education stated on the 29th January that 10,950 elementary school teachers had been killed in the war. If the reference is to Prussians only, as we should naturally assume to be the case, the proportion of teachers killed is extraordinarily high, for in the Berliner Tageblatt of the 12th July, 1916, the head of the Prussian Elementary Education Department is.quoted assaying: &quot;We reckon the number of Prussian teachers at the war at from 40,000 to 50,000, and the number of killed at 4,000.&quot; The killed can hardly have grown from 4,000 in July to 10,950 in January, so it may be that the latter figure refers to the German Empire. Even so, it would be a very high one, for if the number of Prussian teachers mobilized was 40,000 to 50,000 in July, the figure for the whole of Germany could not well have exceeded 75,000 at that date.The total number of teachers called up down to the 15th May, 1915, Wets st/S-tccI by the German Teachers&apos; Union to have been 64,501, or 34*39 per cent, of the total in the Empire, which is thus fixed at 187,557. Of these it may be assumed that about 140,000 were of military age, as the proportion aged 18-48 at last census was 74 per cent. From these figures it appears that only a little over 50 per cent, of the teachers of military age have been called up, but that at least 15 per cent, of those called up have been killed. These numbers agree sufficiently well with the statement made by the Prussian Education Minister in the debate already referred to, that 8,000 out of 15,000 secondary school teachers had been called up for service, and that 1,295 of them, or 16&apos;2 per cent., had been killed. Thus for the teaching profession we have direct evidence of the exemption of a large proportion of the men of military age.The bearing of the proportion reported killed upon the question of total German casualties is obvious, as if it applied generally it would imply 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 killed in the German army during the first two and a half years of the war.A administration:The number of administrative officials acting under the Imperial State and local Governments must now be enormous. Not only^are there war demands for increase in administration to be met of the same type as those which have absorbed so large a personnel in this country (as, for instance, under the National Civilian Service Law, priority arrangements for metal supplies and railway transport, foreign purchasing organization, pensions and separation allowance control, &amp;c), hut a very large number of organizations have been brought into being, largely as a result of the blockade, which are so far without analogues in this country. The Berliner Tageblatt of the 1st and 2nd March, 1917, gives a list of 242 &quot; of the most important offices&quot; thus set up for the control of foodstuffs, metals, textiles and textile materials, clothing, leather, tobacco, cnemicais, wood, paper, &amp;c, all but a few of which are unrepresented in this country. These central offices, nearly all in Berlin, work through local organizations partly consisting of their own employees and partly furnished by local bodies such as the communal unions, so that the total amount of labour involved centrally and peripherally must be enormous.To give a few illustrations of the extent to which the control of the food supply has thus been carried, we may quote the &quot; Egg Supply Board,&quot; the &quot; Imperial Board for Legumes,&quot; the &quot;Imperial Brandy Board,&quot; the &quot;Eel Import Company,&apos;&apos; the &quot;Board of Control for Marine Shell-fish,&quot; the &quot; War Company for Sauerkraut,&quot; the. &quot; Peat-fibre
Committee,&quot; the &quot;Nettle Cultivation Company,&quot; and the &quot;War Committee for Fodder Substitutes,&quot; besides the more important offices, such as the &quot;War Food Department,&quot; the &quot; Central Purchasing Company,&quot; the &quot; Imperial Corn Control Board,&quot; the &quot; Imperial Fat Control Board,&quot; the &quot; Imperial Clothing Board,&quot; the &quot; Central Office for Supply of Coal and other Fuel,&quot; &amp;c. The constitution of a number at least of these boards, e.A., Corn and Fat Control Boards, consists of an administrative section, which is a public authority, and of a business section, which is a limited company. Figures showing the staffs required, by one or two of these, offices have been published.The Central Purchasing Company had in July 1916 an office staff of 2,300 male employees, 1.700 women typists, and 250 juvenile messengers. The male staff was evidently largely of military age, for we are told that all men employed had been classed as fit for garrison service or had been injured in the war. The Imperial Corn Office had a staff in December 1916 of 1,081 employees, and bought 4$ million tons of corn a year through 800 purchasing agencies.It will be seen that the total staffs, central and local, of these various boards and companies must amount in the aggregate to a very large figure. No doubt the lower posts would be held, as in the case of the Central Purchasing Company, by men of inferior military classification, but it has to be borne in mind that, since the account of its staff was written, the distinction between fitness for garrison duty and for service at the front has been in great measure abolished by revision of exemptions under a lowered standard. The brains and administrative and commercial experience required to run such organizations would be so difficult to obtain in the rapidly increasing numbers required that probably many men fully fit for military service have had to be kept back for the purpose.Of course, much of this work replaces that normally carried on by the usual commercial agencies of wholesale and retail trade. This consideration, upon which stress is laid in the Russian staff report, should not, however, in our opinion, be taken as an offset to the requirements of the new organizations, for we doubt whether men of military age would have been left to any extent in shops and wholesale offices if business had continued to flow through the old channels.In addition to these activities of the central and provincial Governments, greatly increased duties have been laid upon the municipal authorities. Some of these, such as the administration of the rationing system, the expropriation of dairy products by communal unions on behalf of the Jmperial E&quot;at Control Board, the requisitioning of articles of copper, bronze, and now aluminium, and the Government scrutiny of food stocks in the hands of farmers now being carried out by these unions, are of a type unrepresented in this country ; while others, such as the distribution of separation allowances and of rent and coal grants to soldiers&apos; wives, are undertaken here by other agencies, in part of a voluntary nature. The effect upon municipal staffs may be judged from the fact that in Neukolln, a suburb of Berlin with some 315,000 inhabitants, the increase since the war of municipal salaries has amounted to If million marks, rhis sum covers war bonuses to old employees as well as the salaries of new members of the staff. As the population of Neukolln is about one eighty-fifth of. that of all German towns of over 15,000 inhabitants, the increase in municipal salaries in the larger towns, to which in the main no doubt the conditions of Neukolln appty, may amount to some 150,000,000 M., or 7,500,0001., aud the numbers of new officials therefore possibly to anything up to 50,000.Another indication of the addition to municipal staffs entailed by war conditions, in this case by food rationing alone, is afforded by the statement that the staff required for the purpose in Munich is 700. Munich contains about one-fortieth of the population inhabiting towns of over 15,000 population in Germany, 26,675,000 in all in 1913, and the total number of new officials discharging this one duty alone may therefore be 28,000 in ail the larger towns of Germany, a figure which agrees sufficiently well with the previous estimate of staff for all new duties on the basis of Neukolln&apos;s pay-sheet.It would be difficult to say, on the strength of these figures, which apply to about two-fifths of the total German population, what numbers would be required for similar purposes outside the large towns. Although food rationing is much more developed in them than in the rural districts, there are other forms of communal activity applying particularly to the latter, such as the requisitioning of dairy products already referred to, as to which we are told (Vorwarts, 28th April, 1917) that there are over 18,000 butter-collecting offices in Germany, many of them collecting also milk and eggs. The frequent censuses carried out several times yearly of the numbers of animals and supplies of food in the country must also entaii the employment of many officials in the rural districts.   An unusually close scrutiny of the stocks of food held by farmers in
excess of their personal needs is now being carried out by order of the Government, With reference to this Die Konjunktur says that it involves the visiting of some 5,000,000 farms in 74,000 separate communes, and adds : &quot; If we assume that for each commune an average of ten men will be needed a very moderate estimate - we shall need some three-quarters of a million officials.&quot; It would seem that the creation of new local officials may have made even greater progress in the country districts than in the towns.Certainly the supply must have shown signs of running short, for we find the requirements of communal authorities ranked along with those of traffic undertakings in the list of purposes to which the labour secured by the National Civilian Service Law is to be applied (Vossische Zeitung, 2nd March, 1917).It would probably be futile to attempt to fix a figure for the number of men of military age now employed on administration, the old as well as the new, in Germany, The police force, for instance, normally employs a considerable number of men of military age, but we are without information as to the extent to which these have been mobilized. In view of the facts quoted as to new administrative activities alone, it is evident that the total number of reservations for the purposes of administration must be very large, probably running into hundreds of thousands in the aggregate.Total Reservations.As a result of the foregoing very incomplete survey of the civil demands upon German man-power, other than for the production of coal and iron and steel and for munitions and railway transport, already rated at 1,850,000 in all, we think it reason-able to assess the total of such demands at not less than 3,000,000 men of military age, inclusive of any excess of non-mobilizable men of classes 1889-1918 over 500,000 (see page 3).CASUALTIES, PERMANENT AND FLOATING.No estimate of German casualties at the present stage of the war can be regarded as other than an approximation, containino- very considerable possibilities of error. We find, however, as the result of approaching this matter from different points of view, that the various results obtained differ less among themselves than might, perhaps, have been expected ; and we feel, therefore, that in fixing the totals at 3,800,000 permanent and 500,000 temporary casualties (men under treatment who will again become fit for military service), we are putting down figures which, while they may well differ from the actual totals by hundreds of thousands, can scarcely be in error by more than half a million.Permanent Casualties.The first of the four estimates compared may be described as that of the Director of Military Intelligence, as it has been prepared in his Department. Its methods, in common with any others applicable to the purpose, are no doubt open to criticism; but the results obtained so fairiy represent the mean of those given by all the methods we have been able to emp^ that we have adopted them without modification for the purpose of fixing a definite figure for the table on page 22, although we should &quot;prefer our estimate of permanent casualties to be taken in more general terms, at from 3^ to 4 millions. Some of us would, in fact, place it nearer the former and others nearer the latter figure.1. The Estimate of the Director of Military Intelligence.The German permanent casualties up to the 31st January, 1916, were estimatec in the last report of the Committee by accepting the total of dead, prisoners, anc missing acknowledged in German official casualty lists, and applying British experience to calculate the number of men invalided from wounds and sickness, which the German lists do not report.It Was stated on page 10 of the previous report that, although the German official casualty lists published up to the beginning of the Verdun fighting in 1916 did not contain intrinsic evidence of falsification, the later lists showed signs of deliberate retardation and could not be accepted.An examination of the German official casualty lists published since the date of the previous report confirms this view. There are so many signs of deliberate retardation that the Committee has decided that the totak acknowledged in. the lists cannot be
used as a basis for their estimate of permanent casualties.^ The German casualty lists have, however, provided the means of estimating the infantry casualties of divisions engaged in heavy fighting.Up to the 6th December, 1916, the casualties were pubhshed by units, and it was possible, therefore, to follow the casualties acknowledged up to that date by every unit which fouo-ht in the battle of the Somme. It was found that those divisions which had not obviously failed to complete their returns by the 6th December showed a total of infantry casualties which, allowing for normal delays in publication, could be taken as 50 per cent, of strength for each period of engagement in the battle^The total Somme casualties based on this percentage were estimated at 700,000, and it is of interest to note that the Germans substituted alphabetical lists for unit lists a few days after a similar estimate was published in the press by a military correspon-dent who appeared occasionally to have access to official figures.The following method has been adopted in estimating the German casualties from the 1st February, 1916, to the 80th April, 1917 :-The German units in the field have been classed each month under one of the following headings : 1. Engaged in heavy fighting.2. Engaged in normal trench warfare.3. Besting.The total casualties of units engaged in heavy fighting have, been estimated by applying the Somme percentage, the permanent casualties (in accordance with British and French experience) being estimated at 40 per cent, of the total casualties.The casualties of units engaged in normal trench warfare have been estimated by applying a percentage deduced from British experience.The British rate of net infantry wastage in normal trench warfare has been calculated to be 615 per cent per month. The figures obtained by applying this percentage have been reduced by 20 per cent, to allow for the more rapid expansion of the British army and for the greater liveliness of the British front, tNo casualties for sickness have been allowed either for resting units or for troops on the lines of communication and in Germany, as the numbers are too small to affect an estimate which cannot but be approximate.The permanent casualties between the 1st February, 1916, and 30th April, 1917, estimated by the method outlined above, amount to 1,697,000. To these must be added the total of 2,102,000 estimated in the previous report for the first eighteen months&apos; fighting, giving a total for the whole thirty-three months of approximately 3,800,000.It is possible to check this estimate as follows : If we take the total of newly-trained infantry required for each British battalion per month, and apply 80 per cent, of this total (see above) to the German battalions in the field up to the end of January 1916, and 90 per cent, to the total of German battalions in the field since the end of January 1916 (by which time the Germans were beginning to draw upon inferior material for their drafts), we obtain for permanent and floating casualties a total of 4,250,000, compared with our estimate of 4,300,000.* Not only is there evidence of deliberate retardation in acknowledging casualties incurred in heavy lighting such as that in front of Verdun and on the Somrne, in which the information concerning the eugage-ment of the enemy&apos;s units is sufficiently exact to enable an accurate check to be applied, but an examination of the total casualties recorded by infantry regiments since the beginning of the war reveals many irre-concilable discrepancies, some of which were pointed out in the previous report, see, e.g., the last three paragraphs ou page 8 of that report.The differences between the casualties acknowledged by individual infantry regiments do not correspond with their fighting history. A regiment thar, acknowledged over 2,000 casualties for live weeks&apos; fighting on the Somme records less than 1,720 casualties for the rest of the. war. A regiment that fought at Yerdun and then on the Somme acknowledges less than 5,000 casualties for the whole war, whereas another regiment that fought at Verdun as well as in the Eastern theatre acknowledges nearly 17,000 casualties.There are many similar discrepancies.t It is sometimes urged that the fighting in the East has been much less severe than the fighting in the VY est. It was pointed out in the previous report that, this does not agree with the recorded casualties during the hrst eleven months of the war, at the end of which time it was possible to cumpare casualties acknowledged by divisions that had fought solely on the Western or the Eastern front.Since that date there has been so much reorganisation and movement from one theatre to another that, it is impossible to make a divisional comparison for the whole period of the war.An examination of regimental totals, however, shows that the four active regiments which acknowledge the heaviest casualties have fought on the Eastern front during the greater part of the war, and four of thehve reserve regiments which acknowledge the highest casualties have fought in the Eastern theatre or the--Balkans during the whole of the war.1718-1] a
2. Numbers as deduced from the German Casualty Lists.These lists, taken at their face value, may be shown to point to a permanent wastage of close on 3 millions. As there is every reason at the present time to refuse to take them at their face value, the increase from this figure to the 3j millions to 4 millions of our estimate seems reasonable, amounting as it does to an increase of not more than 25 per cent.The dead, prisoners, and missing in the casualty lists published up to the 30th May aggregate 1,625,537. Owing to delay in publication, these lists inay be taken as representing the German account of losses sustained up to the end of March, at which elate the number of German prisoners taken by the Allies was about 330,000. Deducting this number we may say that the fatalities admitted by the Germans for the first thirty-two months of war numbered 1,295,000. It is necessary to arrive at the figure in this way in order to divide the missing into unreported dead and unreported prisoners. (We assume that deserters in the interior of Germany or across the frontiers of neutral countries are not included in the casualty lists.)The number of deaths reported  since the  beginning  of the war may thusbe said to average   40,000   per month.     Adding 40,000 for April, though thiscan scarcely be adequate in view of the heavy fighting in that month, we get 1,335,000to the 30th April. The German casualty lists afford no information as to numbers of menpermanently disabled by wounds or sickness, but in British experience the ratio of menpermanently disabled for service at the front to total dead, including dead amongst themissing, is as 1 : 1.   On this basis the total German permanent casualties to the 30thApril, as deduced from the casualty lists, are as follows :-Dead        ............ .........1,335,000Permanently unfit    ... ... ... ... ... ...   1,335,000Prisoners   ... ... ,       ... ... ... ... ...     380,000Total      ...............   3,050,000We think it proper, however, *to assume that the proportion of men classed as unfit for service at the front to dead may be somewhat lower in the German army than in the British, especially as the French Staff Memorandum on German man-power of the 16th March, 1916, estimates the corresponding French proportion, on data which it admits to be imperfect, at 59 incapacitated to 100 dead.It seems preferable, therefore, merely to &quot;say that from the German official lists themselves the permanent losses can be estimated at a figure approaching 3 millions. Our view of the character of these lists is such that we consider this deduction quite consistent with an estimate of 3J- to 4 millions as the actual figure.3. Official Returns of Deaths from Violence in German Towns.Another German official source of information regarding casualties is provided by the weekly publications of the Imperial Office of Public iiealth (Ver&amp;fjentlichen des Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamts), which normally give, amongst other information, the number of deaths from violence every week in each town of over 15,000 population. The sum of these, as reported for 1913, was 17,927, and for 1915, 141,583.The excess of 123,656 cannot well be explained otherwise than as representing deaths of wounded men in hospital.* Some of these would no doubt be deaths of wounded prisoners, but, on the other hand, many wounded Germans must die outside the limits of the towns dealt with, which contain only about two-fifths of the total population, whether in other parts of Germany or in the occupied territories before they can be evacuated to Germany. Even bearing in mind, therefore, that the hospitals may be largely concentrated in the towns, the total numbers dying of wounds could scarcely be put, on the basis of these figures, at less than 200,000, and might be much more.The British proportion of killed to died of wounds is roughly as 3 to 1, but there is good reason to believe that, in German practice, wounded men who die before reaching a hospital or dressing station, and who in the British returns are classed as killed, are reported as died of wounds.    An examination of the German casualty lists,* The writer of an article in the Food Supplement to the War Office Daily Renew of the Foreign Press attributes the excess mainly to &quot; suicides, murders, and accidents of all kinds.&quot; This seems to be quite out of the question. The numbers returned are far too great to be seriously affected by murder or suicide. Suicides notably decreased in this country in 1915 and fatal accidents did not increase, so there is no reason to assume enormous increases under war conditions in Germany.There is abundant evidence in the lists themselves that the deaths of men killed at the front are not included, e.g., a number of important towns shew little or no increase in the deaths from violence reported over the year 1913.
it&apos; fact, suggests that in their case the proportion of kiiled to died of wounds should be more nearly as 2 : 1 than as 3 : 1. Assuming this proportion and taking the total number dying of wounds in 1915 at 200,000 or more, the killed, including died of wounds, in 1915 would come to 600.000 at least. The deaths, other than those from disease, acknowledged in the German casualty lists for 1915 amounted to about 450,000, so the difference is very considerable. If the total dead acknowledged in the lists up to the 31st May, 1917, were increased in like proportion, they would amount to about 1 780.000 ; and the total permanent casualties incurred up to the 30th April would come to nearly 4 millions.There are peculiarities in these returns of deaths from violence which are difficult to explain, such as the absence of increase in certain towns, including particularly seme of the largest, but otherwise following no apparent rule as to character or situation. It is evident, however, that the German Government considers that the information possesses significance for us, as it has suppressed it. We have not quoted the returns for 1916 because these were obviously falsified, the deaths from violence falling suddenly from 12,000 to 13,000 per month in the latter mouths of 1915 to 2,817 in January 1916. Later in the year they were for some reason allowed gradually to regain their old level, the number reported for August being 12,764, but at the beginning of 1917 the column for deaths from violence wras cut out of the tables altogether.4. Deaths of Teachers.The last evidence we shall deal with is that derived from the figures as to elementary and secondary school teachers referred to on page 16. These show that out of a number of men sufficiently large to form a good sample the deaths have amounted to at least 15 16 per cent, of the number mobilized As the total mobilized may be estimated at about 11,000,000 (Mr. Gerard, late United States Ambassador in Berlin, has been recently quoted as putting it at 12,000,000), the total dead, if this figure applied all round, would be about 1,700,000, and the permanent casualties therefore 3-1- 4 millions.Floating Casualties.The number of these has been estimated, as described on page 11 of our previous report, by the application of British experience to the German army strength. As, however, the methods adopted for estimating permanent casualties embrace all cases under treatment which are destined to become permanent casualties, in the sense of unfitness to return to the front line, such cases are here deducted from the estimated numbers under treatment or temporarily on light duty, &amp;c. On the other hand, as the German numbers in the field have increased by about 25 per cent, since our previous estimate, the temporary casualties may be supposed to have increased correspondingly. Allowing for this increase, but making for permanent casualties under treatment a deduction at the British experience rate of about 30 per cent, of total sick and wounded treated, we reach the figure of 590,000 sick and wounded under treatment who will recover&apos; sufficient!v to become fit again for the fighting line. It is by no means certain, however, that, especially under present circumstances, the period allowed for convalescence is as long in the German as in the British service, and we have therefore thought it wiser to reduce this figure to the round half million.NUMBER OF MEN UNDER ARMS ON APRIL 30, 1917.The number of divisions in the field is 232, together with four independent Landwehr brigades.The number of infantry battalions in regiments in all theatres is 2,262. There are also 298 Landsturm infantry battalions, which, though they are not grouped in regiments, are known to be attached to infantry divisions or to be employed in sectors of the front line.The strength of all infantry battalions, exclusive of machine-gun companies, is taken at 750 men, which is the establishment laid down for infantry and Jager battalions on the Western front in a secret memorandum, dated the 12th March, 1917, issued by the Prussian War Ministry, in agreement with the Bavarian, Saxon, and Wurttemberg War Ministries.The number of men in Field Recruit Depots is calculated according to the establishment laid down in a similar memorandum dated the 7th February, 1917.-The number of men in other arms and in the administrative services, both in higher formations and on the lines of communication within the zone of the armies, as
well as the number of men in Germany, has been calculated by applying to every unit the most recent documentary information concerning its establishment.It is impossible to calculate the number of men in the field by multiplying the number of infantry and cavalry divisions by their respective establishments. Such a method would exclude not only corps troops, army troops, General Headquarter troops, and lines of communication troops, but also a considerable number of units which, though employed in the front line, are sector troops and do not move with divisions.As regards the new divisions forming in Germany, a series of forty-two regiments has been identified. Forty of these regiments, which were formed at the beginning of 1917, appear to have been grouped in ten divisions, each of four regiments.As it is improbable that these divisions would take the held as four-regiment divisions, it has been assumed, for the purpose of calculating their strength, that on the 30th April, the forty-two regiments represented ten divisions of three regiments each, and twelve regiments that were possibly intended for garrison duty on neutral frontiers.The following table summarizes the number of men under arms on the 30th April, 1917 : In the field Infantry battalions, Jiiger battalions, Landsturm battalions in thefront line, machine-gun units, and dismounted cavahy ...   2,204,000Other units in the zone of the armies   ... ,.. ... ...   2,570,000 -Field recruit, depots ... ... ... ... ... ...     224,000Total in the field        ...         ...         ... ... 4,998,000In Germany Under arms (excluding men in depots and new formations) ... 045,000In new formations  ...         ...         ...         ...         ... ... 200,000In depots (excluding 1919 class*)       ...         ...         ... ... 420,000Total in Germany       ... ... ... ...   1,265,000Grand total under arms (excluding 1919 class*)    ...   6,263,000 * Part of the 1919 class is already in the depots, June 19, 1917.An independent estimate ot the French General Staff gives a total of 6,315,000, an excess of only 52,000. Of this excess, a total of 50,000 is due to a difference in the estimate of the strength of the new divisions still in Germany.GENERAL   SURVEY OF RESOURCES.We are now in a position to compare our estimates of the expenditure of German resources in men with the numbers available for disposal. This is done in the following table, from which it will be seen that the sum of the various estimates falls short of the total at disposal by some 627,000 men :  Tabular Summary of Conclusions as to German Personnel on April 30,German Males who attained the Ages 17-4-8 during the Year 1916.(Classes J 889-1919 inclusive.)Under arms (army) classes 1889-1918   ...          ... ... 6,263,000,,    (navy)   ...          ...          ...          ... ... 175,000Class 1919 (available this year)f          ...          ... ... 500,000Permanent casualties (army)   ...          ...          ... ... 3,800,000Other casualties, involving temporary incapacity (army) ... 500,000Naval casualties      ...          ...          ...          ... ... 35,000Mobilizable men necessarily retained in civil occupations ... 3,000,000Men in class 1919 not mobilizable owing to immaturity ... 150,000Physically unfit, apart from the above   ...          ... ... 500,000Unaccounted for      ...          ...          ...         ... ... 627,00015,550,000Classes 1889-1918 (see page 2) ... ... ...        14,900,000Class 1919 (see page 2)j        ... ... ... ... 650,00015,550,000f Part of the 1919 class was already under arms on the 30th April (see page 23). As the whole class must be reckoned under the heading of available reserves, it is unnecessary for the purpose of our calculation to distinguish between the proportion in the depots and the proportion not yet called up.
Comparing this with the similar table in our previous report, the chief difference, oartfrom the inclusion of two additional classes and from the increase by 1,000,000 of the estimate of total casualties, is the transfer of most of the men taken as necessarily retained in civil occupations from the class of physically unfit to that of physically fit for military service. : It will be seen that this alteration, which has become necessary in view of what is now known as to French &quot;and surmised as to German practice in regard to the physical standard for military service, is one of nomenclature rather than of substance. The figures which matter, those expressing the total number of men not under any circumstances available for military service, have been reduced only from 4,000,000 to 3,500,000.The balance of 627,000 may be accounted for by shortage in any or all of the other items of the table, except those referring to class 1919 ; or might conceivably represent a reserve of men not yet mobilized who can still be withdrawn from their present civil occupations. If it represents a shortage in the estimates, the items chiefly concerned, because the largest (apart from that for the forces under arms as to which information is much more definite), and at the same time the most doubtful, are permanent casualties and men necessarily retained in civil occupations, the figure for the latter being a minimum which may perhaps be largely exceeded in fact. In view of the importance of each of these heads and of the great liability to error of even the most careful estimates in regard to them, we do not think the fact that 627,000 men are left unaccounted for possesses any significance. The numerical value of each item in the table has been lixed without any reference to the joint capacity of the whole to account for the men available; and under these circumstances we are so far from considering that these 627,000 men must necessarily exist in the form of an uncalled reserve that, even apart from that possibility altogether, we should not have been surprised if the discrepancy had been greater.At the same time the figures in the table are entirely consistent with the exist-enee of a considerable uncalled reserve, which is, in our opinion, neither proved nor disproved by the table, or, as we have elsewhere described it, by the balance-sheet method of estimation which it epitomises. It is for this reason that, as stated in our opening paragraph, we prefer the method of directly estimating remaining German resources from such evidence of their extent as is available to inference from the inconclusive evidence of a balance-sheet, provided, of course, that the materials for such direct estimation are available.It is of importance, therefore, to examine such evidence as we possess bearing directly upon the present extent of German unmobilizecl reserves. We have formed the opinion that the number of- these is small, smaller probably than the 627,000 left unaccounted for by our balance-sheet. This opinion is based to a considerable extent upon the general impression that reserves of mobilizable men must now be very low, which has been left upon our minds by study of the evidence of Germany&apos;s economic position. Apart from this general impression, the following considerations may be adduced as evidence for our opinion : 1. The physically unfit are now being largely called up for service, even in the front line. We are informed by the Directorate of Military Intelligence that this fact has been clearly established both by the physique of a number of the prisoners recently taken, and by the evidence of previous rejections found in possession jof some of them. No doubt other countries in- the war have been forced to resort to similar methods, so far at least as auxiliary service is concerned, and particularly, as we have seen, France. But the extent of the effort made by France robs this argument of any point, for reserves of mobilizable men may be said no longer to exist in that country.2. The class of 1919, lads attaining the age of 18 during the current year, was called up for training in April in at least five army corps districts and in most of the remainder during the following month; and class 1918, one year older, has been m the field from about the same time. It is most unlikely that these classes would have been called upon so early if there were any considerable number of other reserves available. Even in France, where the shortage of men is so great, the class of 1918 has only just (April and May) been called up, and the inference that the Ge rmans have resorted with reluctance to this means of replenishing their ranks may be drawn from the ages at which preceding classes have been embodied since the commencement of the war :

This resource may now be said to be exhausted, for the process cannot well be carried much further; and the practice of the earlier period of the war. when recruits were readily obtainable from other sources than the young classes, shows that it would not now have been carried so far as it has been except under stress of the necessity of getting recruits not obtainable at a less disadvantage. The use for actual fighting of immature boys must be wasteful, and we are informed that in the case of the 1918 class it has so far given very poor results.3. The reduction of the establishment of infantry battalions from 1,000 to 750. already referred to on page 21, is taken as an indication of difficulty in obtaining new recruits to the extent required. It is known from a memorandum issued by the Prussian War Ministry on the 6th December, 1916, that this reduction has been effected in order to provide a reserve of trained men for the purpose of (a.) Maintaining the dep6ts ;(6.) Continuing the series of new divisions which were being formed at that time.It is unlikely that this reduction would have been made if the National Civilian Service Act had been expected to release a large number of men for the army.4. Certain infantry regiments recently formed in Germany have now been disbanded. As already stated on page 22, some forty infantry regiments were raised at the beginning of 1917; with the object of forming a new series of divisions numbered 251 and upwards. None of these divisions has yet taken the field. In order to make good the wastage due to the heavy fighting in the Western theatre during April and May, the recruiting authorities have had to call upon at least eighteen of the new regiments to furnish drafts, and it seems probable that five of these new regiments have been disbanded.The drafting is possibly due to the situation in the Eastern theatre, as a result of which the Germans may have decided to postpone the despatch of the new divisions to the front. The disbandment cannot be so explained. It seems probable that it is due to unforeseen difficulties in providing drafts which have to be found at the expense of the divisions of the new series.5. We have already referred to the evidence that men have recently had to he released from the army for work in agriculture, coal-mining, munitions manufacture, and the railway workshops. The two latter cases are not, perhaps, of any very great signifi-cance, as the&apos;men involved would probably be skilled workmen, and the need for such returns has had to be met by our own and other allied armies. General shortage of reserves is not necessarily implied by such returns to industry, but merely that an error has been made in withdrawing from certain essential industries more of certain types of skilled workers than they can spare.The returns of men to agriculture, however, appear to us to be of greater significance. Agriculture employs about a quarter of the German population, and as it has been very heavily recruited, presumably over a quarter of the army has been drawn from this source. What has occurred may, we think, be taken as absolute proof that this important section of the recruiting field is completely exhausted, the question being whether reversal of the recruiting process will not have to be carried further than it has been if the country is to continue to maintain itself. Probably if the Germans could effect further large captures of Russian troops their anxieties on that score would be at an end.^ Perhaps, however, the strongest evidence of depletion of reserves afforded by the agricultural recruiting position is that, notwithstanding the great shortage of vital agricultural labour, further recruits were, until recently, being drawn from agriculture (seepage 15). It may fairly be argued that in Germany&apos;s circumstances this would not have been done if the sources of supply generally had not fallen to a very hw level.
6. We may here again refer to the fact, already mentioned on page 14, that farmers have been warned not to expect so much military assistance in getting in the crops this year as formerly. In view of the great need for all possible assistance of the kind, this indicates a change in the disposition of the troops serving, which has indeed been pointed out to us by the War Office. -The proportion of reserves in training and of men on the lines of communication, from whom such agricultural assistance would be obtained, to troops at the front, is considerably lower than it was a year ago. This in itself points to depletion of the untrained reserve, as if it were not running short the fighting line would be maintained by fresh enlistments rather than by cutting down necessary services behind the front to the lowest possible limit.7. Industrial compulsion for males in Germany was actually in practice introduced, under the National Civilian Service Law, at the beginning of April. This step does not appear to have been taken at all light-heartedly by the Government, for recent official references to the matter have shown a solicitude for the rights of individuals not characteristic of their source. The Government, in fact, appears to have been in some fear of its public. It delayed compulsion for several months after the law was passed, and showed anxiety to soothe the susceptibilities of the people in regard to it. None the less, it has had to take the step, and it is very significant of the depletion of the civilian reserves of men that in the allocation of the new labour so made available the provision of substitutes to release more recruits for the colours has to share second place along with the freeing of skilled workers, presumably for munitions, &amp;c., first place being given to the requirements of agriculture (see page 15).CONCLUSION.Our general conclusion, then, is that, in addition to the 6,263,000 men under arms, of whom some 620,000 men are not yet in the field and are immediately available as reinforcements, Germany&apos;s reserves of military age consist of the 1919 and younger classes, and possibly a certain number of older men who are still in industry.As regards the 1919 and younger classes, 500,000 men of the 1919 class maybe able to take the field this year and a certain number of the remaining 150,000 men of that class will eventually become available    The younger classes are not expected to take the field at the rate of more than 500,000 men a year from 1918 onwards.Different views may of course be taken as to what might be clone if the military situation became desperate. It is conceivable, for instance, that, granted the accumuia-tion of an adequate stock of munitions, a certain proportion of the skilled fit men now employed upon munitions manufacture might be trained and drafted into the army at the cost of a corresponding decrease in munitions production. A similar course might be taken if the military situation developed favourably for the Central Powers, and the intensity of the fighting on any particular front were to be seriously and permanently diminished.We believe it may be taken for certain that, provided fighting continues on all fronts on the same scale as last year, no further recruits can be found for the army from the manufacture of munitions without sacrificing the essential supply.The possibility of withdrawing more men from the manufacture of munitions is mentioned merely to illustrate the difficulty of&quot; fixing any absolute limit to the provision of recruits by further depletion of industry. As no other industry employing any considerable number of militarily fit men appears to be in any way more in a position to dispense with them, we believe that, subject to the reservation already made, for practical purposes the limit in question may be taken to have been closely approached, if not reached already.Note.-As this report is going through the press the following extract from the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt&quot; of the 28th May has just come to hand : . The present situation thus presents the following characteristics : Increased demand, exhausted supplies and conditions of output, which tend more to decreasing than to expanding production. The authorities have realised that the dangers of tiie situation, which are more than mere transport difficulties, may lead to a production crisis of great magnitude. Hence immediate action has been taken to promote a greater output of coal. The army authorities have already set free 19,000 miners, and a similar number may be expected to be set free in the near future.&quot;This, of course, greatly increases the significance of the reference to the same subject in the issue of the same journal for the 10th May, quoted on page 8, and referred to above.June 19, 1917.
APPENDIX I.Gun Ammunition as an Index of Total Munitions Production.AS the cost of gun ammunition (completed rounds) is in British experience about four-fifths of the total cost of army munitions, apart from clothing and other stores ordered by the Army Contracts Department of the War Office, and as much of the remaining munitions expenditure, as on means of transport, &amp;c, must be closely related to the quantity of gun ammunition provided, this may be taken as a good index of total munitions activity. The advantage of doing so is that the quantities of gun ammunition provided by the chief Allied nations are readily obtainable, whereas a comparison of total munitions production presents many difficulties.The quantities of ammunition produced by or for Great Britain, France, and Italy are set out in a comparative statement prepared by an international office in Paris charged with the task of collating information as to the munitions activities of the Allied countries. These returns classify gun ammunition under four categories, the first of which includes in our case field, mountain, and anti-aircraft guns, the second 4&apos;5-inch howitzers and 60-pounder (5-inch) guns, the third 6-inch guns and howitzers, and the fourth 8-inch, 9-2-inch, 12-inch, and 15-inch howitzers, and 9*2 and 12-inch guns. The classification of French and Italian guns is similar, but.no information is afforded as to the numbers of weapons of different calibres in the fourth category, the only distinction shown being that between guns and howitzers.In order to reduce the cost, and therefore presumably the labour involved in the production of each class of ammunition to a common standard, the prices paid for high explosive shell (completed rounds) produced in England were ascertained for each calibre. The 6-inch shell was taken as a standard, as its diameter (152&apos;5 mm.) closely corresponds with that of the corresponding French and Italian weapons (145-155 mm.). As its cost is given as 6Z. 15s., and that of a field gun round as 2l. 5s., the average British daily production of the latter, 151,533 for the three months October-December 1916, was divided by three to reduce it to terms of 6-inch rounds. As the calibre of the British field gun, 83*8 mm., is appreciably in excess of that of the French and Italian 75 mm. it may be that the total production for these countries should be written down to a somewhat greater extent than [the British to reduce it to 6-inch units, but in the absence of information as to comparative costs of production of French and Italian ammunition it is necessary to use the British figures, and so the units represented by the daily production of gun ammunition of the first category in France and Italy have also been determined by division of rounds produced by three.For the third category no conversion is required, as the weapons represented are all approximately of the size taken as standard, but in the second and fourth categories weapons of different sizes, firing rounds of differing cost, and at diverse rates of expendi-ture, are included. In order to obtain an estimate of the average cost of a round in these two classes, it was necessary to take into account the number of weapons of each calibre, and their average rate of fire, as well as the cost of a completed round in each case. The necessary information was available only in the case of the British army, and it has been necessary, therefore, to assume that the average shell fired in cate-gories 2 and 4 is of the same size in the case of the other armies as of the British.The British averages were determined by multiplying the numbers of weapons in the field of each nature in categories 2 and 4 by the average weekly expenditure in rounds during 1916 to get the relative volume of fire from each class of howdtzer and gun. These volumes of fire were then multiplied by the cost in pounds sterling of the high explosive round in each case and the products summed to obtain the total weekly cost, and this figure divided by the total number of rounds fired per week to obtain average cost per round in categories 2 and 4, These proved to be 3&apos;85L in category 2 and 14*941 in category 4, so the total productions were multiplied by &apos;57 in the one case, and by 2*21 in the other to reduce to terms comparable with the 6-inch round, costing 675.L Applying the same factors to French and Italian production, we obtain the following figures:

This is done in the following table, from which it appears that the German daily production may be estimated at about 261,000 6-inch units as against about 151,000 to 152,000 each for France and Great Britain :-[718-1]* But see Appendix II.I

During the financial year 1916-17 these were, munitions for British use, 248,000,000Z. at home and 265,000,000Z. abroad.^ It is estimated that the cost of ammunition from abroad was 20 per cent, in excess of home prices, so if we apply the same ratio to munitions generally, we may say that the value of imported material at British prices was 221,000,0001., so that of the total production paid for during the year, 47 per cent, in value was imported. Evidently, therefore, the number of workers on munitions in this country forms only about 53 per cent, of the total number represented by the munitions produced for the land forces of the British Empire to which these figures apply.While the calculation in Appendix I based on anticipated production for the first half of 1917 points to a yearly British expenditure on gun ammunition of 375,579,0001 (at British prices), the yearly expenditure, similarly calculated from the daily production of October to December 1916, being 280,200,O0OZ., the actual expenditures as stated by the Ministry of Munitions exceed these figures by about one-third. Thus for October-December 1916 expenditures were 45,000,000?, American and Canadian, and 58,000.0001 British. Allowing for 20 per cent, excess of American and Canadian prices, the total expenditure for the three months at British prices was about 95,500,0001., or at the rate of 382,000,0001. per year. For January-March 1917 expenditures were 5O,OOO,O00Z. American and Canadian, and 78,000,000Z. British, the total equivalent at British prices being 120,000,0001 for the quarter, or 480,000,000Z. a year, as against 375,590,0001. average of January-June as calculated. For the financial year 1917-18, the estimated expenditure is 50O,000,O0OZ., which, taking expenditure on gun ammunition as four-fifths of the total, implies a munitions expenditure of 625,000,000Z., as against 586,400,000Z. for 1916-17, of which 73,400,000Z. was for allied nations. The difference from the 375,579,000Z. calculated in Appendix I, would be very serious if expenditure were the subject of investigation, but as it is only used as a means of obtaining a simple* See page 4 as to reason for including Canadian expenditure under this head.Germany
easure of munitions production by reducing the different sizes of shell to a common tandard the deficiency in expenditure calculated is of importance only if it applies to one category of gun ammunition more than another, and of this there is no evidence. Any such error even if present would, moreover, apply to all the countries compared, including Germany, and if the relative importance of gun ammunition or any particular variety thereof were a little under or over stated, that would matter only in so far as the misstatement affected the countries concerned in unequal degree. Probably there-fore the deficiency in expenditure as calculated in Appendix 1 from production is for our purpose a matter of minor importance.In order to arrive at the proportion of British munitions, steel excluded, produced in this country, it is necessary to deduct the cost of steel represented in the 248,000,0001. and 221,000,0001. quoted above as representing values at British prices of purchases in 1916-17. The cost of unworked steel included in these figures is stated to be 33,500,0001 for 2100,000 tons of steel purchased at home, and 13,650,0001 for 650,000 tons purchased abroad. This steel was devoted to the manufacture of munitions in Great Britain, and its cost, so far as it was purchased in this country, must be deducted from the 248,000,000Z. British expenditure, reducing that amount to 214,500,0001. as representing British expenditure on munitions, less steel.The total expenditure on imported munitions having been 265,000,0001,, this amount has first to be reduced by 13,650,0001, say 13,500,0001., for cost of unworked steel imported. The remaining 251,500,000Z. represents the total cost of foreign munitions, including the value of the steel used in their production, and has to be reduced by one-sixth (120 : 100) to allow for excess of cost, taken at 20 per cent. This reduction brings the figure to 209,500,0O0Z., which has to be further reduced to allow for value of steel included.   This we can only estimate on the British analogy.The, cost of the 650,000 tons of foreign steel used in British munitions, at the home price of 16Z. per ton, would be 10,500,0001, which, with the 33,500,0001 paid for British steel, makes the cost of steel in British-produced munitions 44,000,000Z. This sum of 10,500,0001. has also to be added to the total expenditure of 248,000,0001. for British material, bringing it to 258,500,000Z., of which 44,000,000Z., or 17 per cent., represents the cost of steel. Applying this ratio to the foreign purchases, valued at 209,500,000Z., their value at British prices, less 35,5OO,O0OZ., cost of steel used in their production, comes to 174,000,000Z., as against the corresponding figure of 214,500,000Z. for British products.On these figures the cost at British piices of the total production, less steel, is about 388,500,000Z., of which just over 55 per cent, is for British material. But as many munition components, such as empty shell cases, in which the full steel cost of the finished article is represented, are imported, cost of steel being therefore probably a larger item in the foreign than the British purchases, and so insufficiently allowed for by the 17 per cent, taken above, and as the proportion of foreign to total expenditure tends to decrease, it has been taken pot 40 per cent, instead of 45 per cent., a figure which is approved by the Ministry of Munitions as approximately representing the facts. cVfter June, when important shell contracts expire, it is anticipated that of a total expenditure of 50,000,000Z. per month, 32,500,000Z. will be for home production, so that, allowing for higher cost of foreign purchases, fully two-thirds of our total munitions will be produced at home.The stages by which the above estimate of 40-45 per cent, expenditure on munitions produced abroad has been reached may be summarized as follows:  Purchases at home for British use       ... ... ... ...    248,000,000Deduct cost of steel produced at home        ... ...      33,500,000Cost of British production, less steel ... ... ...     214,500,000Foreign purchases Canada   ......         ... ... ... ... ... 72,000,000United States of America ... ... ... ... ... 150,000.000Elsewhere        ...         ... ... ... ... ... 43,000,000265,000,000Deduct umvorked foreign steel used for British production   13,500,000Cost of foreign production, less unworked steel ... ...    251,500,000Deduct one-sixth, extra cost of foreign material        ...      42,000,000Value of foreign production, less unworked steel, at British prices    209,500,000 Deduct value of steel in this figure, taken at 17 per cent.      35,500,000Value of foreign production, less steel, at British prices ...    174,000,000
The figure of 17 per cent., taken as representing the proportion of French munitions, other than unvrorked steel, imported from abroad, is derived from the fact, of which we are informed bv the French Ministry of Munitions, that of a total expenditure up to the 30th April of 15,255,000,000 fir.., 2,610,000,000 fr. has been for imported products. The figure seems low in comparison with British yearly expenditure, but it is said to cover material of war properly so called, including artillery and small-arms and their ammunition, trench warfare material, gas apparatus and masks, railway material, motors, and so forth. For imported steel 1,358,000,000 fr. had been paid, and for home-produced steel 585,000,000 fr. Here, again, the figures appear very low in comparison with British yearly expenditure, which may be estimated as above at about 90,000,0001, or 2,565,000,000 fr. at 27^ fr. to the pound sterling.The discrepancy is, of course, in part due to the very small ratio borne by expenditure on munitions in the early period of the war to the present scale of expenditure in France, as well as in this country.APPENDIX III.Employment in the Munition Trades in Germany early in 1917 as estimated fromGerman Statistics.The journal of the German Department of Labour Statistics publishes monthly figures as to the numbers of workpeople employed by a large number of representative industrial firms. These returns are grouped according to industry, and enable comparison to be made with the numbers employed by the same firms one month and one year earlier, and so, assuming the adequacy of the selected firms as a sample of the whole, display the increase or decrease of employment in these industries. It thus becomes possible to compare the state of employment in June 1915 with June 1914. the last complete month of peace, and in June 1916 with June 1915, and so with June 1914, and then, carrying forward the comparison month by month, to bring it down to February 1917, the latest month for which the figures are available, and so to show how the numbers employed at that date compare with the figures for June 1914. The firms reporting are not in all cases the same throughout, but comparison is in each instance restricted to firms reporting for each of the periods compared. The total numbers of workpeople employed in each industry in June 1914 have been ascertained from the accident insurance statistics for about that date.The characteristic munition industries are dealt with in the German statistics under the four heads of &quot;mining, iron, steel, and other metal trades,&quot; &quot;mechanical engineering,&quot; &quot; electrical engineering,&quot; and &quot; chemical trades.&quot; The last three all fall within our munitions group, but the first, a large and composite class, includes mining, and iron and steel production, which we have reason to exclude from that group, as well as other industries falling within it. In order to arrive at an estimate for munitions production from these returns it is therefore necessary to establish figures for employment in mining and in iron and steel production, which may be deducted from the total estimated for &quot; mining, iron, steel, and other metal trades.&quot; For this, as it happens, there is more material than in the case of most German industries. Miners in February 1917 being estimated, as decribedon page 6, at 625,000, and iron and steel production workers at 300,000, the sum of the four groups of industries enumerated above, less 925,000, gives a figure which may be taken to represent employment in the German munition industries last February.In the first group, mining, iron and steel, &amp;c, the number of workpeople employed before the war, as fixed by the accident insurance statistics for 1913, was 2,383,821, and by the method described above it is estimated that this group had increased by 43 27 per cent, in February 1917, the estimated total at that date being 3,415,000, of whom all but 925,000, or 2,490,000, are munition workers. For the second group, mechanical engineering, there is an estimated increase of 31 &quot;53 per cent., with a February total of 582,000 ; for the third group, electrical engineering, there is an increase of 6-25 per cent., total 391,000; and for the fourth group, chemical industries, there is an estimated decrease of 1-80 per cent., total 277,000, the grand total for the whole group of the workers in munition trades thus arrived at for February 1917 being 3,740,000.
Part II.-AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.Report Revised to June 1, 1917.MALES OF MILITARY AGE IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.THE classes serving at the present time are those born in the years 1867-1899&apos; i.e., men aged 17^-50^. The census date being the 31st December, it is convenient to calculate the probable number of men of corresponding ages, 17-50, at the end of 1916. The number at these ages, corrected by deduction of foreigners resident in Austria, and by addition of 266,487 Austro-Hungarians estimated to have been resident in Germany at&quot; the commencement of the war, was taken in our previous report at 11,681,898&apos; for the 31st December, 1915. This is the number which would have resulted from a continuance to that date of the rate of increase during the period 1900-1910. On this assumption the further increase during the year 1916 would have been about 74,000, bringing the estimate for the end of 1916 up to 11,756,000, the numbers at the various age groups being as follows: Date of Birth.	Class.	Age on Deo. 31, 1916.	Population.1899	1919	17-	523,3001898	1918	18-	504,2001897	1*917	19-	478.0001896-92	1916-12	-   20-	2,180,4001891-87	1911-07	25-	1,988,-8001896-82	1906-02	30-	1,746,200188i-77	1901-1897	35-	1,574,1001876-72	1896-92	40-	1,448.8001871-67	1891-87	45-50	1,312,2001899-1867	1)19-1887	17-50	11,756,000It will be noted that men in their 51st year of age on the 31st December those born in the year 1866 are not included in the above total. There are, however, a certain number of men of this age and one year older serving, though the classes as a whole are not.   This point will be referred to later.Calculation on the basis of a continuance of the previous intercensal rate of increase is not a wholly satisfactory means of estimating what the population would have amounted to on the 31st December, 1916, under peace conditions, but is probably the best method available. It involves two tacit assumptions : (1) that the combined effect of birth and death rates upon the population under consideration has remained the same as in 1900-10 ; and (2) that the average rate of net emigration has remained as m 1900-10, or, if not, that any change in (1) has been neutralised by converse change in (2). These assumptions are almost certainly untrue. The death rates to be considered under (1) are those of the years 1911 onwards, and these have up till the commencement of the war been lower than those of 1900-10. The birth rates, on the other hand, affecting such a population are those of approximately the latter half 1SRQ nmeteentl1 century, or, more exactly, 1860 to 1899 as compared with 1850 to lobJ, and for these two periods the Austro-Hungarian birth rate was much the same, it is probable therefore that the true rate of increase should be taken on this account at a little above that of 1900-10.The net emigration to be considered under (2) was slightly greater during the years 1911 onwards to the outbreak of war than in 1900-10, but sine August 1914 [718-1] K
it has of conrse ceased, so that from this cause also there is probably some under-estimation in our figures.* They have, moreover, to be increased, as in the case of Germany, to allow for men assumed to have died under peace conditions before the end of 1916, but who lived long enough to join the Army and die as soldiers. The number of such men was taken in the case of Germany at 100,000, and so cannot be taken at less than 60,000 for Austria-Hungary. Adding this number to the 11,756,000 available population, and making allowance for the considerations discussed under (1) and (2) above, the total population from which soldiers aged 17-50 could be drawn may be put at 12,000,000.In endeavouring to estimate the reserves available for the Army from this number of men we feel that even more than in the case of Germany reliance must be placed upon evidence bearing directly upon their actual number rather than upon estimate; of Army strength, casualties sustained, and numbers necessarily retained in civil life, by deduction of which from the total man-power a figure for reserves still available might be arrived at. The reason for this is two-fold : first, that the direct evidence o approaching exhaustion of reserves is even more marked than in the case of Germany and, secondly, that the materials for estimating two out of the three main forms o expenditure of resources in men, namely, casualties and necessary reservations inadequate for Germany, are much more so in the case of Austria. These three channels of expenditure may now be considered.NUMBER OF MEN UNDER ARMS ON JUNE 1, 1917.The forces in the field at the time of our previous report were estimated by the Director of Military Intelligence to have numbered 2,250,000, whereas his estimate for the beginning of June last amounts to only 1,872,000, a decrease of 378,000. The number of divisions and of infantry battalions is indeed known to have slightly increased, the former from 79 to 80^- and the latter from 997 to 1,003, but there is good evidence that the average strength per battalion has decreased during the pas year. Thus the average of forty-eight company strengths reported by prisoners during May and June was only 161, and no instances of the full strength of 250 were recorded. Moreover, a Russian General Staff report, dated the 19th February, 1917, states thai &quot; the official strength of the companies of active regiments has been reduced to 160- \ SO men.&quot; This evidence has recently been reinforced by an Italian capture of a document giving the establishments of the 1st, 2nd, and.-3rd battalions of the 2nd Regiment of the 16th Division. These amount to 741, 73.1, and 730 officers and men respectively, In view of this evidence, the War Office reduction of estimated average battalion strength from. 900 in 1916 to 760 in 1917 appears by no means excessive. The estimate of the total strength of active infantry in the field is accordingly 752,250, a reduction of 145,050 from the previous estimate.In addition to this reduction in infantry there is evidence from officer prisoners&apos; statements that there has been considerable reduction in the strength of &quot;march&apos;&apos; battalions among the extra-divisional troops. These &quot; march &quot; battalions corresponc to the German field recruit depots from which drafts are made to the regiments in the field, and the estimated reduction is put at 80,000, or about 25 per cent, of the previous strength.The remaining estimated reduction of J 52,950 is less clearly substantiated than the 225,050 for divisional infantry and &quot;march&quot; battalions, and&apos;cannot be acceptec with the same confidence, owing to the absence of direct evidence in its support. It is considered, however, by the Director of Military Intelligence that the facts in his possession particularly the absence of increase of the number of divisions by the methods used for this purpose in the German army, and the necessity, under the cir-cumstances of Austrian campaigning, of maintaining the proportionate strength of the infantry in the Austrian army point to a decrease in the strength of other arms more or less in proportion to that ascertained to have occurred in the infantry. We see no reason to differ from this opinion, and therefore accept the estimate of the Director of* The returns published by the Board of Trade of Austro-Hungariaus entering the vaiious countries of immigration, which are not quite complete, but are probably more reliable than the Austrian figures of emigration, total 2,424,220 for the years 1901-10, and 995.815 for the years 1911-14, or very nearly a quarter of a million per annum in each case. When such corrections as the figures supplied suggest have been made, it may be said that for the years 1901-10 emigrants from Austria-Hungary averaged 242.000 per annum, and for the sis years 1911-1(3 170.000, the reduction in the average for the latter period being due to the war.
Military Intelligence, recognising however, as he himself does, that it may be appreciably in error. On the other hand, we do not consider that this margin of error is sufficiently large to affect our calculations very seriously, for, compared with the uncertainty which exists as to casualties and as to the numbers of men retained as indispensable for industry, the estimate of army strength may be regarded as aclose one. . . ...Men on the lines of communication, m tne absence of information on this point,are estimated at the same figure as in 1916, viz., 550,000, notwithstanding the reductionin the German numbers so assigned from 1,000,000 in 191G to 645,000 this year, butthe numbers in training now are taken at 515,000 as against 600,000 a year ago.This number includes the first muster of the class of 1919, called to the colours inFebruary last, and assessed at 400,000, and the products of various revisions of olderclasses, &quot;including the fourth revision of all classes from 1893 to 1913, the yield ofwhich has  been put at  20,000-    It is not an unnatural assumption that  theproductiveness of the successive revisions has progressively diminished, but circum-stances can be imagined under which this might not be so, as, for instance, a suddenreduction in the physical standard of recruiting, or the introduction of administrativemachinery effective for the release for military service of men previously treated asindispensable in their civil occupations.   Although we are aware of no such evidencein the case of Austria, we can only regard the yields estimated for these variousrevisions as very doubtful quantities.CASUALTIES, PERMANENT AND FLOATING.Permanent casualties during the first twenty-two months of the war, up to the 31st May, 1916, were estimated in our previous report to have averaged 80,000 per month, apart from prisoners of war, of whom about 1,100,000 were held by the Allies at that date. The total, apart from prisoners, was therefore 1,760,000, or, including prisoners, 2,860,000. The rate of loss continued very heavy till the Russian offensive of 1910 came to an end about the end of September, so for the four months June-September 1916 it is estimated by the Director of Military Intelligence that the previously assumed rate of permanent wastage, 80,00b1 per month, apart from prisoners, may be taken to apply, bringing the total for the twenty-six months to the end of September to 2,080,000. For the eight- months from that date up to the end of May 1917 Austrian losses were relatively slight. In consideration of the character of the fighting, mainly trench warfare, and some of that of a very inactive type, the permanent wastage for this period, apart from prisoners, is assessed by the Director of Military Intelligence at 225,000, bringing the total, exclusive of prisoners, to 2,305,000, or, in round numbers, 2,300,000. To these losses must be added the number of prisoners in the hands of the Allies at the end of May, some 1,800,000 men, including those taken by the Italians in their May offensive&quot; The total estimate of permanent casualties to the end of May thus comes to 4,100,000.Temporary wastage is estimated, as in our previous report, at 400,000. This figure includes the total number of men absent from their units through wounds or sickness, and so does not correspond with the estimate of 500,000 for Germany, which excludes all men under treatment who will not recover to fitness for the fighting line.MEN REMAINING IN INDUSTRY.^ Doubtful as our estimate under this head for Germany proved to be, the difficulty or framing such an estimate for Austria-Hungary is vastly greater. In fact, a careful survey of the material at our disposal has convinced us of the impossibility of basing such an estimate upon Austrian evidence as to the industrial and administrative needs of the Dual Empire. ^ In these circumstances it is obviously impossible to estimate reserves by collocation of military expenditure of man-power with its essential reservation for civil duties. All that can be clone is to show, in the light of the estimate of such military expenditure already arrived at, what the balance, either unfit for military service, indispensable in civil life, or still available as reserves, amounts to. This balance can then be criticised in the light of such direct Knowledge of depletion of reserves as we possess independently of calculations founded upon total man-power.
GENERAL SURVEY OF RESOURCES.The 12,000,000 men of military age taken as originally available are estimated to be made up as follows : Forces in the field       .. .. .. .. .. 1,872,000Lines of communication.. .. .. . . . - - - 550,000In training-     ..          .. .. - - .. .. - - 5i5.000Navy and naval reserves .. .. .. . - .. 50,000Prisoners of war .. .. ... .. - - 1,800,000Other permanent casualties .. - . .. - . - - 2,300,000Temporary casualties   .. .. ., .. .. 400,000Remaining in civil life (unfit, indispensable, or available as reserves)   ..     4,513,00012,000.000The last item is understated to an indeterminable but slight extent, because a few of the men serving in the army are not included in the total of 12,000,000, which includes only men born during the years 1867 to 1899. Men born in the years I860 and 1866, who were of course under 50 years of age at the commencement of the war, have served with the army till recently, but an Imperial decree of the 21st May, 1917, ordered the release from service by the 30th June of ail such men with the exception of those voluntarily enlisted, and of officers and officials on the retired and reserve lists. If this decree has been fully carried out, the correction remaining to he made on account of these two classes is probably quite insignificant.In the case of Germany the proportion of men now exempted as physically unfit for service was assessed, on the analogy of France, at only 5 per cent. If this proportion is taken to hold good&quot; also for Austria-Hungary, the number so exempted there should be about 600,000, which might be raised to 700,000 by allowance for immaturity in the youngest classes. Deduction of this number brings our figure for men capable of military service, but still remaining in civil life, to 3,813,000. This number appears to us so high, in view of the evidence, discussed later, pointing towards exhaustion of reserves, that we look upon it with some suspicion.In the case of Germany, our estimate for what it is worth of necessary reservations was 3,000,000, but addition of this figure to estimated military expenditure of men showed a deficit of 627,000 as compared with the total to be accounted for. This deficit may be due to underestimation of the number of &quot; indispensable &quot; men, which may therefore be taken as estimated for Germany at 3,000,000 to 3,600,000.In our previous Report we discussed the difficulty which arose from the apparently large number of men of military age retained in civil life in Austria-Hungary as compared with the figure arrived at in our estimates (admittedly speculative, as they doubtless are) of similar reservations in Germany; and we felt that the discrepancy for which we were unable to account to our satisfaction threw grave doubts upon more than one item in our balance-sheet, in view of what even then we described as the known shortage of mobilisable men in Austria-Hungary. We thought that the much smaller number of prisoners of war in the Austrian Empire as compared with those in Germany might have been a reason for the retention of more native-born men in the former Empire for industrial and agricultural purposes ; and we suggested that owing to the disaffection of some large sections of the population the proportion of unmobilisable men might have been higher than in either Germany or France. Two gentlemen well acquainted with conditions in the Austrian Empire (Mr. Crosby, late First Secretary at the American Embassy, Vienna, and Dr. Seton Watson) have kindly allowed us to question them on this and other points, and have expressed the opinion that the recruiting of men in the disaffected portion of the Empire had probably been stricter and more effective than in the loyal provinces. Moreover, the Vienna statement of prisoners of war in the hands of the Central Powers in May 1917, referred to in our report on Germany, gives 1,092,055 to Austria-Hungary as against 1,690,731 to Germany, the German excess of prisoners being about 55 per cent, as against about 35 per cent, excess in population. The difference is, therefore, not very striking, but it may well be that Germany has been able also to make more use of deported civilians and other foreign labour.The result of our endeavours to trace the disposal of the men of military age in Austria-Hungary by way of a balance-sheet is therefore fully as unsatisfactory as on the last occasion, and for the reasons given in a preceding paragraph we feel it necessary to discard to a large extent the calculations on which it is based, and to rely on the direct evidence of decreasing man-power,- which is, as we have said, more
marked than in the case of Germany, and certainly more marked than at the date ofour previous Report. .This evidence may be stated to consist m the reduction ol army strength at a time when the strength of the German army has been increased, and notwithstanding strenuous efforts to obtain more men. The reduction in army strength may be a little less or a little greater than the estimate provided for us by the Director of Military Intelligence, but of its reality there can be little doubt. While the number of battalions has remained practically stationary their strength has been reduced by about one-sixth, and the &quot; march &quot; battalions, which form their field reserve, have also been reduced both in number and in strength. If it had been at all possible we cannot doubt that the increase of establishment and strength of the German army effected during the past year would have been accompanied by a similar increase in that of Austria-Hungary.AVhile reduction of numbers under such circumstances must be held to indicate inability to maintain them, the cause of this inability is shown to be lack of human material by the extraordinary efforts to raise men which have been made, and notwithstanding which the reduction has occurred. The age of service has been more widely extended in Austria at both its limits than in any other of the principal countries engaged in the war. The upper limit of age is 50, as against 48 in Germany, and men of 50-52 are not wholly exempt. At the other end of the scale the class of 1919 was called up in February last, when its average age was just over 17^-, while in Germany its enrolment only commenced in April, the date at which the class of 1918, one year older, was called up in France. A country which possessed reserves of men available for service would hardly call like this upon its boys, whose employment must be attended by many disadvantages.Another piece of evidence pointing strongly in the same direction is furnished by the number of &quot; revisions &quot; to which older classes have been subjected. When the classes 1915 to 1893 had been revised for the third time in February of this year it was supposed by military critics that their capacity for furnishing recruits was probably exhausted. This &quot; combing,&quot; however, was quickly followed by a fourth in June for all classes from 1913 to 1893 inclusive. There can be no certainty, of course, that even this represents the final squeeze by which it may be sought to obtain recruits of these ages, but we think the inference a fair one that after a second, third, and fourth revision in November (191(3), February, and June little available material can remain. At the least these repeated revisions, together with the extensive employment of lads and elderly men, must represent a great recruiting effort, and as, in spite of such an effort, the numbers in the field have declined, the evidence pointing towards depletion of reserves appears to us to be very strongvWe consider this evidence much stronger and more definite than that by wrhich the ii gure of 4,513,000 men of 18-50 remaining in civil life has been arrived at (p. 4), Either some of the other figures on which it depends are seriously in error or the circumstances in Austria-Hungary are such as to require the retention in civil life of a much larger proportion of men than in Germany or France. The former seems the more likely alternative, though both factors may of course operate simultaneously, but whatever the cause may be, we believe that in the obscure Austrian situation the two most definite facts are that&apos; the army strength is now rather under than over 2,000,000 (excluding recruits in training), and that the Government is no longer in a position to increase, and hardly even to maintain it, even in the absence of any extraordinary losses such as were suffered in the summer of 1916.    1August 22, 1917.
fPart III.-TURKEY.Report Revised to November 80, 1916.IN the following report, the method of estimating remaining resources in personnel by estimation of original man-power and deduction of estimated wastage has been abandoned, for reasons which will be stated later on, in favour of the alternative principle of deducing these resources from our knowledge of the numbers and categories of men serving in the field and training in the depots, and from an estimate of the enemy&apos;s remaining power to add to them. As the war proceeds, and as evidence accumulates of the actual depletion of the enemy&apos;s reserves of man-power, it is obvious that addition of such remaining reserves to numbers in the field will tend more and more in all cases to give a %truer picture of remaining strength than estimates of population originally mobilizable, and of wastage, both of which may be seriously in error. In any case, the first point requiring consideration is the strength of the army in the field.Since the time when our former report on Turkish personnel (dated the 28th July, 1916), was prepared, evidence has accumulated indicating that a great effort is being made to provide for the maximum possible increase of the forces in the field at an early date; but there is no evidence of any corresponding increase, up to the present moment, of the Turkish forces in the field.The estimated strength of field and garrison units is now about 590,000, as opposed to 500,000 in our last report, but allowance is now made for the strength of staffs, taken at 20,000, and omitted from that report.Though there is apparently an increase of 70,000 on these figures, this is not really the case, as all divisions are now estimated at full establishment, whereas in our former figure, only those divisions, twenty-six out of fifty-two, the strength of which was unknown, were so estimated, the remainder being taken, as reported upon, at u rifle &quot; strength.An alternative estimate, constructed on the lines previously followed, gives 491,000 as the present strength of field and garrison units, or about 30,000 less -than the estimate we accepted in our last report.In view of the facts that the lower estimate excludes, in the case of some divisions, men temporarily engaged upon non-combatant duties, who would in other countries be included in estimated strength in the field; and that, against the over-estimation involved by taking all units at full establishment, there has to be set the existence of non-Moslem non-combatant levies doing work such as transport, which in other armies accounts for an appreciable proportion of the strength reckoned as combatant, we have no hesitation in preferring the higher figure 590,000. The number of divisions in the field has decreased by eight since our last report was written, in consequence of the amalgamation of weak units in the third army that serving in the Caucasus. We understand, however, that the strength of the. field army has not decreased in correspondence with the number of its divisions, and that it remains approximately the same as at the date of our last report.The next point for consideration is the extent to which their reserves of trained or untrained men not yet put in the field will enable the Turks to add to this army of about 600,000 men. ff this problem is to be approached on the lines usually followed, we require to know (a.) The total number of fit men of military age at the beginning of the war whom Turkey was then, or may since have become, in a position to call to the colours ;(b.) The strength of an annual contingent of youths attaining military age ;(c.) The loss from casualties, including both permanent casualties and the floatingloss from temporary casualties ; (d.) The loss, whether of trained or untrained material, from sickness and othersources of wastage apart from casualties inflicted by the enemy anddesertions.
Our survey of the information available under these heads leads ns to the conclusion that it is insufficient to enable us to form on these lines any reliable estimate of Turkish reserves.(a.) Size of Military Population.A communication, dated the 23rd November, has been received from the Italian Admiralty Intelligence Division fixing the population of the Empire at 21,450,000, or about I1 &quot;million in excess of our previous estimate. This information is stated to be derived from a reliable informant who is connected with the Turkish General Staff. Its form is somewhat peculiar, viz., &quot; A census of the Turkish element of the Ottoman Empire in 1915 gives the following returns, &amp;c.&quot; At first sight the reference might appear to be to the Ottoman, or at least to the Moslem, element in the population only.. If that were so, the figure given would be so widely at variance with all previous estimates that we could only consider the statement a piece of German propaganda analogous to and worthy of as little credit as Enver Pasha&apos;s recent boast of an army of 3,000,000 men. This cannot be the case, however, for the number quoted for Asia Minor is stated to include Armenians. It appears probable, therefore, that the limitation to the &quot; Turkish element&quot; of the Ottoman Empire is meant to exclude Egypt and other territories recently nominally subject to the Empire. The figure is accepted in this sense at the War Office as representing the result of a recent census, and therefore more authoritative than the previous estimates.Accepting this then as the total population of the country, we may say that it probably implies about 17,000,000 Moslems, if Christians are reckoned at about 4 million and Jews at somewhat less than half a million. Of these 17,000,000, we estimate that about 3,200,000, mainly consisting of the inhabitants of Arabia and the majority of the Kurds, would not be available for recruiting. The remaining 13,800,000 might now it is thought, owing to increase of Governmental control under German tutelage, be recruited to a considerably higher standard than that accepted at the time of our last report, but what actual addition should now be made is a matter of complete uncertainty. It should be noted that the capacity of the Turkish population to produce recruits at the beginning of the war was probably reduced below the average, as the result of wastage of men in previous wars, which is believed to have brought about a considerable preponderance of females in the population.(b.) Amount of Annual Contingent.Our information as to this illustrates no less forcibly the difficulty of estimating Turkish resources. It was estimated in the Cairo Handbook of the Turkish Army of February 1916 at 200,000, but in our previous report we gave our reasons for considering such a figure to be incredible, and for adopting the revised Cairo estimate of 80,000. If, however, the total recruitable strength of the Turks has increased to a notable extent owing to increased stringency and effectiveness of government, the estimate for the annual contingent should be correspondingly increased also.(c.) Casualties.Permanent casualties, including desertions, were estimated in our last report at about 500,000, and are estimated at 625,000 for the beginning of December. The element of uncertainty here, though considerable, appears to be less than in regard to the other points to be taken into consideration.(d.) Wastage apart from Casualties.Although this is known to be heavy, an estimate would be a matter of extreme, difficulty. In the case of European Powers in the present war, this consideration is of such minor importance that it is conveniently merged with casualties, but this has not been the case in their former wars, nor does&quot; it appear to be the case with Turkey now. Disease is believed to have been very fatal, both to enrolled troops and to the general population, from which further troops may be drawn. As indicative of the possible effect upon our calculations of this form of wastage, we may refer to the loss suffered by the Turks in their campaign of 1897 against Greece, which has been placed at less than 2,000 men killed and disabled, hut at over 25,000 dead or permanently invalided from disease.   This goes to show that
Turkey is probably still in the position occupied, until a recent date, by all civile countries in regard to the relative extent of losses from wounds and from disease i war. No doubt German control has done much to improve upon the standard of 189/ which could not in any case be taken as applying to the present war, but information of a very heavy loss from disease, particularly dysentery, typhus, cholera, and malaria, has been received, though the actual extent of this loss remains unknown to us. Eve if we had not this information, moreover, we should be of opinion, in the light of common knowledge as to Turkish organisation, that, notwithstanding German efforts, the relation of the loss from disease to loss from casualties of the Turkish armies remained very different from the European standard attained in the present war. Turkey, in fact, may be fighting under the conditions prevalent in Europe a centur ago, and even in South Africa fifteen years ago, when casualties did not constitute tit main source of wastage. If so, even granted that the estimate of 625,000 permaneai Turkish casualties is correct, we are still without the information as to wastage require if an estimate of remaining personnel is to be derived from numbers origmail available.With so much uncertainty attaching to the various items of information essentia to the construction of a balance-sheet of Turkish man-power it would be quite possibl to construct a table of the kind, harmonising with the known strength of the field army; and containing no entries capable, at the moment, of disproof. But we feel that sucii a table would be too much a work of imagination to be of any value, and we have therefore been led to consider whether this method of treating the subject is now essential in framing an estimate of Turkey&apos;s remaining resources. Fortunately, from this point of view, the present recruiting policy of the Turkish Government is such that the factors referred to are of rapidly lessening importance for this purpose. That policy aims at getting every possible man into the army at the earliest possible moment, and as a consequence the numbers reported by contact as serving with the colours must rapidly come to represent the total obtainable. When this result is attained, as it should be early in 1917, it will be possible to infer original resources from a knowledge of wastage, or wastage from a knowdedge of original resources, but both will be immaterial to the estimation of remaining resources.The evidence that the Turkish Government is making every effort to place every possible man in the field is thus of cardinal importance. The following measures have been taken since the date of our last report: (a.) The calling up of young classes has been carried further than by any other belligerent country, as class 1919 has already been summoned to the depots for training, and class 1918 has joined or is joining field units.(&amp;.) The official &quot;Gazette&quot; of the 29th October, 1916,&apos;publishes the following provisional law&quot; concerning young men fit for military service :-&quot; Those men, wdio according to the age appearing on the official registers are not yet ready to be called up for military service, but who from the point of view of their health and bodily development, are considered as fit for military service by the heads of their recruiting offices, will be sent for training.&quot;In other wTords there is to be practically no lower age limit for military service in Turkey in future.(e.) Men are retained with the colours till the age of 50 (though it is believed that after 45 they will be mostly employed in labour battalions and coast defence), and men under that age who had hitherto escaped service are now liable for home service.(d.) All exemptions on payment have been abolished, at least nominally, though it seems possible that a considerable number of men who have hitherto been exempted on payment will still escape service through influence.(e.) Emigrants and immigrants have been called up, including, under the latter, Greeks and other foreign subjects, and inducements are being offered to Serbians to join the Turkish army.(/.) More pressure has certainly been brought to bear on the partially productive races of the Empire, such as Arabs, Kurds, and Druzes, but Christians and Jews, though probably now being enrolled, are not as yet being trained as combatants. It is, of course, conceivable that under German direction non-Moslems might be drafted into some of the European armies, but there is no evidence so far that this has occurred, the indications being rather
that they are actually required for non-combatant work for the Turkish(a ) Moslenus from many of Turkey&apos;s lost European provinces are being summoned t0 Turkey for enrolment in the army. We are informed that this statement does not apply to the Moslem subjects of Bulgaria, over 100,000 of military age, who are being made to serve in the Bulgarian army, but that it does apply to the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina and probably to some extent of Macedonia and the Dobrudja. A friendly neutral who left Constantinople on the 15th October reported that a number of trainloads of men from Macedonia and the Dobrudja, &amp;c, were coming into Constantinople from the direction of Adrianople when he came through ; and it was announced in the Bulgarian paper &quot; Balkanska Posta &quot; of the 24th October that all Turkish subjects in Bosnia - Herzegovina between 18 and 42 had been required to report themselves for duty with the Turkish army, and that 80,000 had already done so. This number would probably approximate to the total available from this source, the Moslem population returned at the census of 1910 being 612,000, and the total to be obtained from the former provinces of Turkey in Europe, exclusive of Bulgaria, may perhaps amount to about 100,000.As regards the effect of these measures, it is impossible to do more than guess at this even in the case of the enrolment of the junior classes, which, might be definitely measured if the size of the annual contingent were accurately known.We are driven, therefore, to reliance upon such knowledge as is available of the results so far obtained by the increased stringency of the new policy. This knowledge is not as yet very great, but it should rapidly increase from now on as the effects of the most recent measures materialise. On this point we are unable to say more than that, although the increase of pressure upon Arabs and Kurds, &amp;c, and the refusal of money exemptions and greater stringency generally have no doubt been in gradually increasing operation for some considerable time, they do not seem as yet to have led to any material increase in the numbers in the field. We understand there is reason to think that some new divisions&quot;, of which one has recently been located on the Bosphorus and another on the Ismid peninsula, may have been formed largely as a result of the training of the 1918 class, and may at present be held in reserve in the interior of the country. If so, the new classes, which, if a long continuation of the war were anticipated, would be used as drafts to maintain existing forces, are being used in Turkey to make new formations, probably as the result of German demands for troops in the European theatre of the war.We may now endeavour to place a numerical value upon the foregoing considerations.The men now serving in the field are, as already stated, estimated to number 590,000.In addition to these, reserves may be stated as follows : Men in training in depots           ...          ...          ... 50,000Class 1918 (in depots or in new formations)           ... 80,000Class 1919 (in depots)  ...         ...         ...         ... 80,000Recruits from Bosnia-Herzegovina, &amp;c.     ...          ... 100,000Further men estimated to be obtainable as the result of increased stringency, including abolition ofexemptions on payment       ...          ...          ... 200,000Total      .........        ...       510,000&quot;vfj^0^ ^ese items is, of course, exceedingly speculative. So far as abolition of bedel,&apos; or exemption on payment, goes (which, from the monetary loss involved, is estimated as likely to yield an additional 150,000 men), that probably applies chiefly to non-Moslems, who will not be recruited for the Turkish firing line; and increased pressure on Kurds and Arabs may have its effect largely in increased numbers of irregulars, whose usefulness is very limited. In some cases, for instance, these levies cannot be moved from their own country. We should not have been disposed to take sucn a low figure as 200,000, in view of the effort evidently being made under German direction and of the large margin of &quot; partially available &quot; man-power assumed in our 1/18-1] M
previous report, but for the evidence, quoted above, that the results have hitherto been disappointing. Additional recruits from the classes subject to service at the beginning of the war must be found in the main rather by improved administration of the original recruiting law than by the new legislation. We feel that if any very large supply of regular recruits coidd be obtained from this source they would be already, to some extent, in evidence.We have thus a total of 1,100,000 men in, or available for, the army, of whom about 720,000, i.e., all but the last three classes of reserves mentioned above, are trained. The question of the allowance to be made for the effects of the recent increase in stringency of recruiting is, as yet, so doubtful that the total is subject to a considerable margin of error. This must, however, diminish very rapidly, as the men now being recruited are put in the field, leaving, we are assured, few to replace them; and it may be remarked that previous estimates of Turkey&apos;s power to maintain or add to her armies under given conditions of recruiting have, so far, tended to err on the side of excess.January 25, 1917.Part !V.-BULGARIA.Report Revised to December 31, 1916.INF presenting its estimate of the Bulgarian position at the end of 1916, m regard to personnel, we have decided that the subject can best be treated on the lines of our revised report on Turkish personnel, Le., by abandoning the method of a balance-sheet between original resources in man-power and their estimated expenditure in favour of a direct estimate of the resources now remaining. The reasons for adopting this course are similar to those applying in the case of Turkey, namely, the uncertainty attaching to most of the estimates necessary for a balance-sheet, and the accumulating evidence of exhaustion of reserves, from wrhich it follows that resources tend increasingly to be confined to the armies now in the field or under training together with the annual contingents of young recruits as these attain military age.We may first set out the difficulties in regard to the data affecting the problem which have led us to abandon the method followed in our previous report.Population of Military Age and Fitness.This may be estimated with some degree of confidence for Bulgaria itself, for most of which census statistics are available. Even here, however, three difficulties are met with : 1. The deduction for losses in the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 is a matter of uncertainty. In our previous report we assessed these losses at 35,000 to 40,000 men, a figure which appeared to most of us to be small in comparison with the estimates of loss in the present war, but which was founded upon the best information then available to us. Since then further information on this subject leads us to revise this estimate to 60,000 men who would otherwise have been available for the present war.2. The extent of the gain in population resulting from the Balkan wars is open to question. No census of the newly-acquired territory appears ever to have been taken, but from the population estimates of the Director of the Bulgarian Statistical Bureau, it would seem that the official ^estimate of the excess of the population of the new territories over that of the Dobrudja area ceded to Roumania is about 375,000. The population of these new territories (those acquired in 1912-1913) would, of course, be in excess of this by the extent of that lost to Roumania, and it seems doubtful whether recruits could be drawn from this newly-acquired and less perfectly organised popu-lation in quite the same proportion as from the population of Old Bulgaria. We did not think it wise, however, to make any deduction on this account in our previous report.
3. The Moslem population, which was excluded in our previous report as furnishing few if any combatants, is now known to have been made liable to military service,, though the extent to which actual combatants are derived from it is a matter of uncertainty. This population was estimated in our previous report at 133,000 men of military age [17-47]. Assuming the whole population, Moslem and Christian, and in the newly-acquired territories as well as in Old Bulgaria, to be fully available for military service of some description, and deducting the loss in the wars of 1912 and 1913, we may estimate that the males aged 17-47 in Bulgaria itself at the end of 1916 would, under peace conditions, have numbered 945,000, of whom about 165,000 would he physically unfit on the ratio of 17^- per cent, adopted in our last report for reasons therein stated, leaving 780,000 men of military age and fitness.The uncertainty attaching to this figure is not perhaps of a degree seriously prejudicing its use, but the position is very different when we attempt to estimate recruits from the occupied territories, for which no census returns are available. The territories in question, with rough estimates of their population, are as follows : Macedonia          ..         ..         .. .. .. 1,500,000Greek Macedonia east of the Strurna .. .. .. .. 340,000Prishtina-Pristend ..          ..          .. ., .. .. 250,000Dobrudja..         ..         ..         .. .. . . .. 250.000Total .. .. ..       2,340,000The populations quoted are very speculative, and the extent to which they can be drawn upon for recruits to the Bulgarian army is equally so. All except Greek Macedonia had already been recruited for the Serbian or Roumanian armies before their occupation by the Bulgarians, and in our revised report upon Turkey the Turkish population of Macedonia and the Dobrudja was treated as a field for Turkish recruiting capable of yielding 20,000 men.* Bearing these points in mind we are disposed to regard as not unreasonable, though of course highly speculative, the estimate furnished to us that these populations may have provided 5 per cent, of their number as recruits to the Bulgarian or Turkish armies up to the end of 1916. On the number quoted this would amount to 117,000, or deducting the 20,000 Turkish recruits, to 97,000, say 100,000 recruits for the Bulgarian army. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that further men may be found from these sources, and we therefore accept the War Office estimate that they may perhaps be made to yield a further 30,000 men apart from new annual contingents.Annual Contingents.We are informed that during the last year or two before the war the annual number of recruits accepted had grown to 42,000, and that allowing for recruiting of Moslems and aliens, and, we may add, for the rapid increase of population, the strength of an annual contingent from Bulgaria proper may now be estimated at 50,000. These numbers, primarily derived from recruiting records, are slightly in excess of those deducible from the census records, but the difference is not great.The question of the allowance to be made for the occupied territories is a much more difficult one. On the basis of population alone, considered in proportion to that of Bulgaria itself, the contingent available from these areas might be taken at about 20,000. No doubt, however, much of the population dwelling in these territories before the war is no longer there to furnish annual contingents, and some of the recruits obtainable might be unacceptable, so the estimate cannot be made on these lines. On the whole, therefore, bearing in mind that 50,000 may be a rather high figure for Bulgaria itself, we are disposed to estimate the total contingent at 55,000 so long as the territories at present occupied remain in Bulgarian hands.Casualties.The permanent loss from casualties, taken at 90,000 in our last report, is believed by the War Office to have increased to 130,000 by the end of 1916. In view of the heavy fighting of the latter part of 1916 the addition for that period seems not out of* Recent information suggests the possibility that these men after being trained in Turkey have returned to form an additional division in the Bulgarian army, but as, if added to the estimate of Bulgarian. resources, they must be deducted from that recently furnished for Turkey, it will be convenient in this report-to treat them as still a part of the Turkish army. &apos;&apos;    [718-1] N
proportion to the earlier total, but some of us question the heavy losses assumed during the invasion of Serbia in the first three months of the war (65,000, Colonel Cunliffe-Owen). Perhaps the most definite evidence we possess on this point is the statement published in the Sofia press of the 14th June last that killed then amounted to 37,000 and other casualties to 100,000. It is difficult to say what may have been included as &quot; other casualties,&quot; but, judging by British experience, the permanently disabled and dead recorded as missing would be at least half as many again as dead reported as such, so that the loss up to the date in question may perhaps be estimated from this Bulgarian source to have amounted to 92,000, including permanently disabled men still under treatment. To these must be added prisoners and deserters, as well as deaths from disease ; and in view of the fact that 7,000-8,000 men are believed to have deserted many of them to the Greeks between December 1915 and June 19.16, the losses under these three heads for the whole period to June 1916 can scarcely be reckoned at less than 15,000. Thus, on the Bulgarian statement as to the number of dead, an estimate of total permanent loss on the 14th June might have been founded amounting to 107,000, or 17,000 in excess of our previous estimate for a slightly later date. Such an excess would approximately represent the proportion of a floating loss of 50,000 (as estimated for that date) destined to become permanent, and as these are included in the 107,000 but not in the 90,000, the two estimates are in close agreement. We may add that the French staff estimate of permanent losses to the 14th February, 1917, is 132,000 as compared with the War Office figure of 130,000 to the end of 1916.The Committee feel, nevertheless, that - the evidence of loss is not sufficiently substantial to be accepted with confidence ; and this has formed one of the reasons determining them to abandon the balance sheet method of statement.The floating loss from casualties of a temporary nature is probably somewhat higher than at the date of our last report. We then put it at 50,000, but, in view of the heavier fighting of the autumn, and of the fact that the application of British army experience as well as of German experience, as stated in the &quot; Soziale Praxis &quot; of the 14th January, 1917, points to a figure of 60,000-70,000, the 50,000 might be raised to 60,000. The experience of the Western front, however, is not necessarily applicable to the Balkans, and we have no more confidence in the figure suggested for floating than for permanent casualties.Men Retained in Industry.The number of fit men necessarily retained in industry was estimated in our previous report at 60,000, and reasons were given for believing that it was likely to show some increase. We might perhaps now put it, on the strength of the information afforded to us, at 70,000, but this is a very doubtful figure in regard to all the enemy countries, and one as to which estimates are liable to differ widely.Turning from these items of our discarded balance-sheet, we must next examine the two remaining, which are essential to the direct method of estimation proposed  present army strength and reserves. It would of course be impossible to frame an estimate of reserves except by examination of original man-power and its expenditure in the absence of evidence that such reserves were running dry, but there is fortunately general agreement that this is the case with Bulgaria. Apart from new annual contingents, neither the British nor the French Staff estimates &quot;admit the possibility of important Bulgarian reserves. In support of this opinion we may point out that &quot;the view taken in our previous report that exhaustion of reserves had even then been readied has been supported by the course of subsequent events, no additions to army strength (see comparison of present and former estimates on p. 4 ; also footnote on p. 4) being apparent beyond those due to the calling up of the 1919 class. The calling up of this class may itself, indeed, be cited as evidence of exhaustion of reserves, for we are informed by the War Office that not only is it probable that a large proportion, possibly three-quarters,of the 1918 class has been put in the field,but that somemen of the 1919 class may also bewith the Colours, the remainder being in training. As the latter class are not yet on average 18 years of age they would hardly be called upon if important
reserves existed. Other evidence exists in the shape of serious difficulties in regard to agriculture and commerce, owing to the. extent of the mobilisation. For instance, it has been found possible to expend only 200,000 out of 3,500,000 francs voted in 1916 for development of agriculture in the newly-occupied territories. The strongest evidence, however, on this point may probably be held to lie in the general policy of the enemy countries to put the largest possible numbers into the field for this years campaign.Present Army Strength.In our previous report this was reckoned at 430,000, including the 1918 class, but excluding Moslems and Macedonians in transport and other non-combatant corps. As recruiting from these sections of the population has since then been more strictly enforced, and as their limitation to non-combatant duties is less certain, it is now thought better to include them, to the number of, perhaps, 175,000* in the statement of army strength. Including these men and the 1918 and 1919 classes, taken at 50,000 each, the present War Office estimate is put at 540,000. As we estimate each of these classes at 55,000, the total becomes 550,000, or 76,000 less than the French staff estimate of (326,000. We may note that an estimate of Bulgarian army strength derived from our previous figure of 430,000 by making appropriate additions and deductions stands almost midway between the estimates now made by the British and the French staffs. This may be shown as follows : Previous estimate        .. .. .. .. 430,000Add-Macedonian transport personnel .. .. .. 65,000Bulgarian Moslems of military age and fitness      .. 110,0001919 class    .. &apos;   .. .- .. ..    55,000-- 230,000Deduct Additional permanent casualties ..          .. .          .. 40,000,,      floating loss            ..          .. ..          .. 10,000,,      industrial workers    .-. &quot;       . . ..          .. 10,000Men aged 46-47 on 1st January, 1916, and so over militaryage on 1st January, 1917, say..          .. .. 20,0001:60,00080,000 580,000It will thus be seen that if we had had no fresh information from the War Office as to the number of units and their average strength we should have made our estimate 30,000 higher than we do. This discrepancy may of course be due either to greater wastage from casualties or withdrawals for industry or to smaller accessions of strength from the Macedonian and Bulgarian Moslem population than we have allowed for. These figures are all, as already pointed out, so doubtful that a discrepancy of 30,000 arising from their total effect is not surprising. In these circumstances, and granted absence of reserves, the one important point is the reliability of the estimate of army strength, as to which we understand that the Intelligence Directorate of the War Office holds to its own view, but desires to call attention to the higher estimate of the French staff, which is based upon a correspondingly higher estimate of the average strength of the second line battalions, as to the number of which there is no difference of opinion.in estimating total available personnel,! the only additions to be made to the* The Macedonians serving as non-combatants with the Bulgarian army were reckoned at 65,000 at the time of our previous report. The Moslems of military age in Bulgaria were estimated in that report at 133,000, of whom we assume that 110,000 may now be serving in one capacity or another.f Although discarding the balance-sheet method we may refer to the fact that our previous estimate showed 70,000 men unaccounted for by the figures then given. &quot;This would have been only 60,000 if the military population had been estimated as in the present report, but to this figure must now be added the 30,000 by which the present estimate of army strength fails to correspond with that in our earlier report, making a total of 90,000. If, however, a .fresh balance-sheet were constructed for Bulgaria, for which alone the attempt was made before on the strength of the estimates discussed in the present report, the deficit might be assessed at about 70,000. We do not, however, attribute importance to either figure, acd prefer for the reasons given to disregard the apparent discrepancy, as we did before. We think it is not improbable that the demands of agriculture, which were not taken into account in making the estimate of 70,000 fit men necessarily retained in industry, might account for the reservation of another 70,000 fit men if this has in fact been made. The area under cultivation for 1917 outside the \-ar zone in Bulgaria is reported on good authority to be the most extensive yet known, and miaftt account for the balance.
