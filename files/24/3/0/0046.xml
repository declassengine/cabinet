Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. G-140.ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.(Memorandum by Lord Curzon.)ON the 9th February the War Cabinet instructed Sir F. Ponsonbys Committee to prepare a scheme for the proposed new Order on the basis of optional knighthood, i.e., anyone receiving the two higher classes of the Order should be at liberty to decline the knighthood ordinarily associated with those classes, and should append to his name initials which were the equivalent of knighthood, but did not carry with them the titles &quot; Sir &quot; and &quot; Lady.&quot; When this scheme was drawn up, it was thought to be very doubtful whether the letters G.M.B.E. (i.e., Grand Member) and S.C.B.E. (i.e., Star Commander) would meet with popular acceptance, while the difficulty of precedence was felt to he insuperable. Anyone not a Knight could not be placed in front of those1 who are Knights. Accordingly, the G.M.B.E.\s and S.C.B.E.&apos;s and their wives would rank below all Knights Bachelors and their wives, while those recipients of the new Order who had elected to take a knighthood would rank above all Knights Bachelors, and would be placed at the end of the existing orders of knighthood.Confronted with this difficulty, the Cabinet instructed Sir George Cave and myself to confer with Sir F. Ponsonby&apos;s Committee, with a view to seeing whether any other solution could be found.Let it be remembered that the problem before us is to hnd an Order which will be suitable for presentation to and will satisfy the following entirely different classes of persons: (a.) Foreigners, numbering probably several thousands, who have rendered valuable service in the various theatres of war, and who do not understand and would not appreciate an Order without classes or without distinction.(b.) Persons in our own dominions or colonies who attach a good deal of importance to social precedence and to titular prefixes to their names.(c.) Persons of distinction at home, from Princes or Cabinet Ministers down-wards, who have done real service in connection with the war, but to whom it would be absurd to offer the style and title of Knight.(d.) Labour members and trades-unionists who would not refuse a decoration, but would,, for reasons entirely honourable to themselves, abjure a title.(e.) Munition and other war workers in every sort of sphere, many of whom would not care for a title; but a probably equal, perhaps a larger, number of whom would not care for a distinction unless it were accompanied by a title.To found an Order which will satisfy the claims of all these conflicting parties was the almost impossible task set before the Committee.As the result of a Conference held on the 26th March, we decided to submit two alternative schemes to the War Cabinet, for both of which there is something to be said, but neither of which is free from objection. Objections, indeed, are inseparable from any solution that can be proposed.First Seheme-The first scheme contemplates the creation of a single decoration which should follow the continental practice of possessing five classes, but should carry with it no knighthood. Such a decoration, in its various classes, might be bestowed upon every variety of aspirant, both at home and abroad. The nomenclature would be as follows : Grand Commander. Grand Officer. Commander. Officer.   . Associate.G.C.B.E. G.O.B.E C.B.E. O.B.E. A.B.E.
On the Continent it would eive general satisfaction, because it would be in strict accordance with foreign precedent, while the absence of knighthood would be immaterial to foreigners, the majority of whom do not desire, and cannot make use of a knighthood.The scheme possesses the further advantage that women would be elegible to it without the invention of any new title, and could append the same initials to their names as men.Farther, it would dispense the Crown from creating a new Order of knighthood  which would probably mean the permanent addition of 500-800 fresh Knights and Ladies to the establishment of Knights and Ladies in the Empire. On the other hand, any person willing to receive a war award, but anxious to be adorned with a knighthood would not be given the Order, but could be accommodated by inclusion in one of the existing Orders of knighthood, or by being made a Knight Bachelor.Such an Order, moreover, being dissociated from knighthood, might be conferred in its highest classes (a) on persons of the greatest distinction, e.g., a Prime Minister, or a dominion representative (General Smuts), neither of whom would accept knighthood, or on Labour Members and leaders, or on the Clergy.The drawbacks of this scheme are, of course, that it would probably not be sufficiently appreciated in the dominions and colonies, where titles and social precedence are regarded as of great moment. an(j tna^ ft might cause considerable disappointment among those classes in this country whose service in the war has not been wholly untinged by expectations of social preferment to come, and who would prefer a knighthood to any number of ornamental letters. If, on the other hand, knighthoods were conferred in very large numbers on war workers, the value of the new Order would pro tanto be diminished.Second Scheme. The second scheme recognises a fundamental divergence between the aspirations and needs of the various classes concerned, and provides for them by creating: (a) a new Order of knighthood for those to whom a title and precedence are the paramount consideration; (b) a new decoration, of one class only, unaccompanied by title, and carrying no precedence, for those of either sex who hold the opposite view.(a.) The Order would be that of the British Empire with five classes : Knights Grand Cross, or G.C.B.E. ; Knights Commanders, or K.C.B.E.; Commanders, or C.B.E.; Officers, or O.B.E.; Associate, or A.B.E. the first two carrying knighthood. Women woujd be admitted and would become Dames Grand Cross, e.g., Dame Penelope Stanhope, G.C.B.E., and Dame Commander, D.C.B.E. the assumption of the title being optional. It Avould probably be undesirable to give them the title of &quot;Lady,&quot; because otherwise we might have &quot; Mr. Thomas Perkins, A.B.E., and Lady Perkins, K.C.B.E.&quot;-a fruitful source of domestic perturbation.(&amp;.) The decoration would be called War Service Order (W.S.O.) if it were to be confined to the purposes and duration of the war, or National Service Order (N.S.O.) if it were to be a permanent addition to the list of British decorations.It would indeed be the equivalent for civilians to the D.S.O. for soldiers, would he open to both sexes, would raise no pretence of title or precedence, and would largely depend for its distinction upon the list of first appointments and upon a none too profuse distribution afterwards.The advantages of this two-fold scheme have already been indicated. It would apparently provide for every need at home and abroad. On the other hand, there is a certain risk in creating two decorations for the same service : it might be found difficult to weigh against each other the respective merits of, say, the W.S.O. and the O.B.E.; and the W.8.0. would be discredited from the start unless its superior or at least equal distinction were established.Possibly a rule of discrimination might be laid down by giving the W.S.O. to permanent officials, and the O.B.E. to persons who have been temporarily employed during tl)e war.The two schemes are submitted with no sort of exhilaration to the War Cabinet. Wrere it not for the insatiable appetite of the British-speaking community all the world over for titles and precedence, the first would be unhesitatingly recommended.c. or K.April 1, 1917.
