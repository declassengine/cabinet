SECRET.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Second Interim Report of the Sub-Committee on Territorial Changes.Conquest of the German Colonies in Africa.1. OPERATIONS against the German dependencies in Africa were, for the most part originally conceived with a strictly limited objective in view, such, for example, as the destruction of the. important wireless installation at Kamina, in Togoland, the occupation of Buea and the port of Duala in the Cameroons, or the occupation of Tanga, in German East Africa, an operation primarily intended to protect the Uganda Railway and our own East African Protectorate. Eventually, in every case, the scope of the operations was enlarged by the force of circumstances, and the conquest of the German Colony itself became the, objective. In the case of German South-West Africa, however, the destruction of the wireless station at Windhuk was an objective which, from the outset, necessitated the defeat of the enemy&apos;s forces in the Colony (see Appendix (A)).2. Operations against German South-West Africa were begun in September 1914, but were largely in suspense from the middle oiNOctober till early in January 1915, owing to the necessity of suppressing the rebellion in the South African Union. The actual campaign in South-West Africa involved the overcoming of considerable natural difficulties, as well as the defeat of some 8,000-10,000 enemy troops well supplied with ammunition, some artillery, and many machine guns. Under the circumstances, the completion of the conquest of the Colony by the final surrender of the enemy forces in July 1915 was a considerable achievement on the part of General Botha, who commanded the Union forces. These amounted to a maximum strength at any one time of 38,000-40,000 men, exclusive of native and Cape Boy auxiliary personnel, composed of English and Dutch South Africans in almost exactly equal proportions. Imperial assistance was limited to the provision of transport by sea, some Naval, Royal Marine, and Royal Garrison Artillery, and a certain amount of material. Rhodesia furnished an infantry battalion..3. The unconditional surrender of the German forces in Togoland and the destruction of the powerful long-distance wireless station at Kamina were effected in a vigorous campaign lasting only a fortnight (12th-26th August, 1914). The British force consisted of some 2,500 West African troops under British officers, assisted by a small French contingent. In the Cameroons the operations, which began in September 1914, proved of much greater difficulty and duration. The Germans made a most determined resistance till February 1916, when the remnant of their forces finally retired into the adjoining Spanish territory. The maximum forces engaged at any one timejconsisted of over 6,500 Imperial and Colonial troops (mostly black, but including an Indian battalion and sundry Naval and Royal Marine details), about 8,000 French African troops, and a small contingent from the Belgian Congo.4. In German East Africa a really formidable resistance was encountered, and has not yet been crushed. The preparations originally made by the Indian and Imperial Governments were quite inadequate, and ended in failure. It was not till much larger forces were sent out early in 191(3 that British East Africa was relieved from the menace of invasion. The native Askaris, about 18,000 strong, have, under German discipline, proved most effective fighters, and even now are still stubbornly contesting the southern portion of the territory.. The maximum strength of the force under General Smuts&apos;s command has been nearly 70,000 men, exclusive of an equal number of native carriers and of some 12,500.Belgian troops. The bulk of the 15,000 or more white troops employed have been furnished by the South African Union. India [35 8 J
provided about twenty battalions of regular and Imperial service troops, as well as detachments of other arms, mostly Mahommedan troops unsuited for employment against the Turks in Mesopotamia or Egypt, while about twenty black battalions have been provided locally or sent from West Africa.5. The East African and South-West African campaigns also absorbed a very considerable volume of shipping. The total number of ships employed in carrying troops, animals, and stores to East Africa from the United Kingdom, West Africa, and South Africa was sixty, of a gross tonnage of about 360,000 tons, many of which did several journeys. This figure is exclusive of forty-five colliers, carrying about 250,000 tons of coal, and of the ships sent from India. The aggregate figures for these last are not available, but the tonnage employed at certain dates was as follows : December 1915, about 25,000 tons; April 1916, about 39,500 tons ; February 1917, 11,500 tons. For the South-West African campaign about 30,000 fighting troops, largely mounted, and a corresponding proportion of transport and transport personnel were sent by sea to Luderitzbucht and Swakopmund.Military and Political Objections to the Restoration of the Colonies to Germany.6. It is clear from the above brief summary of the operations that the German colonies did not fall into our possession automatically as the consequence of our command of the sea, but involved a serious military effort on the part of the British Empire and its Allies. The total of British Regular troops employed has, it is true, been very small, though, no doubt, a considerable proportion of the South African forces engaged in South-West Africa might have volunteered for general service, wh.ile.the rest of the forces comprised elements which have been usefully employed in minor theatres of war, or for secondary purposes. Even admitting that the direct drain upon the first-class fighting material available for major operations has been relatively small, the total strain on our organising power and our resources in ships, material, and labour has been by no means inconsiderable (see Appendices (A) and (E)).7. Nor can it be said that it would have been safe, either for political or military reasons, to have left the German Colonies alone. In this connection it is impossible to leave out of account the intimate bearing of the presence of Germany, as a Great Power and a potential enemy of the British Empire, in immediate proximity to the South African Union, upon the disloyal element in the Union (see Appendix (B)). The leaders of the recent rebellion were undoubtedly in direct communication with the German authorities, and the rebels generally looked to Germany for support in their attempt to set up an independent republic. The rapidity with which the rebellion was suppressed, and the brilliant success of General Botha&apos;s South-West African campaign, should not obscure from our view the danger with which the whole fabric of the British position in South Africa was-menaced. In East Africa, again, it was British and not German territory that was in danger of being overrun and conquered, until the British Government was perforce obliged to divert to this theatre of war troops and shipping to an extent which has proved by no means an inappreciable strain, upon, our resources. The Cameroon campaign, too, locked up a force of 15,000 men for a year and a half. From the German point of view, indeed, the operations in Africa can only be regarded as a military diversion of the most successful character, in which very limited German forces, cut off from all hope of support, have detained far larger Allied forces in the case of East Africa for over two and a half years.8. The attention of the Committee has been drawn by the Admiralty to the fact that the German bases in Africa added very much to our difficulty in disposing of German cruisers, and that the &quot; Konigsberg &quot; managed to keep a considerable number of cruisers watching her for nine months by sheltering in an East African river. The German wireless station at Kamina, in Togoland, though destroyed by us before the end of August 1914, had already rendered the very greatest service to German -shipping in the opening days of the war (see Appendix (B)).9. The Committee consider that the German Colonies have cost the Empire such appreciable sacrifices, and have involved so prolonged a diversion of effort from the main theatre of war, that it is clearly undesirable to risk incurring similar sacrifices -and difficulties in the conceivable event of another war.   They are, moreover, of
opinion that the military disadvantages&apos; likely to anise from the re-establishment of Germany in these Colonies would he much more serious in the future than they have moved in this war. The Germans had not made any very serious preparations in these Colonies for a war with England when they precipitated the war in Europe, nor had they any experience of the. effectiveness of the long-range submarine. It is probable that, if the German Colonies were restored, they would be much more effectively organised from the military point of view. Duala in the Oameroons, and one of the East African ports, would be equipped as powerful submarine bases, and the immunity which we have so far enjoyed in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans would be at an end.*10. In a competition of armaments the British system of colonial government, with its consideration for the rights and wishes of the natives, and with its reluctance to face large expenditure on grants in aid, would be at a disadvantage confronted with the German system, based on a much greater readiness to spend money for ulterior economic or military ends, and a more systematic and ruthless utilisation of the human material which it may control. The development of the resources - of our tropical Empire should be a most important factor in that general increase of productive power in the British Empire upon which we shall have to rely to make good the wastage involved in the war. But that object will be frustrated if the military drain upon those Colonies both arrests the development and swallows up its results.11. The Committee also feel that they cannot ignore the very serious objections to the retransfer of the natives of the occupied territories to German rule, both on general humanitarian grounds and on the more particular ground of the relations which have been developed with the natives since our occupation. In almost every case our advent has been welcomed, and the natives have consistently stood by us since. In Togoland, for instance, chiefs and people voluntarily brought in and surrendered the rifles with which the Germans had supplied them to resist our advance. According to information supplied by the Governor of the Gold Coast the cultivated area in the portion of Togoland in British occupation has increased some 30 per cent, since the expulsion of the Germans, an increase which he attributes mainly to the greater confidence of the natives in the British administration. In East Africa many of the surrendered German Askaris have enlisted in the British forces. To hand back these people to their former masters would be to inflict a severe blow to our reputation for good faith and loyalty. Nor is it possible, in countries where our rule depends to so large an extent on prestige as in Nigeria or British East Africa, to overlook the dama^ino- effect which the retrocession of the German Colonies would have in the eyes of our own native subjects (see Appendices (B), (E), and (G)).General Advantages of Retaining the German Colonies.12. Apart from the strong military and other objections already mentioned to restoring the African Colonies to Germany, it may be pointed out that their retention would secure the improvement of our territorial frontiers in Africa, the improvement of the internal communications of the Empire, and an addition to its economic resources.13. The annexation of German South-West Africa would substitute a land frontier of 700 miles with the Portuguese for a frontier of 1,400 miles with the Germans, and give the whole of British South Africa a more compact shape, better suited for defence and for economic development. The annexation of German East Africa would eliminate an indefensible frontier of 550 miles in immediate proximity to our main artery of communications in British East Africa, as well as the present frontier of 200 miles between German territory and Rhodesia, and replace them bv a more natural frontier, the total length of which, not reckoniug some 550 miles&quot; of Lakes Tanganyika and Nyasa, is only 600 miles. (This is on, the assumption that Belgium would not retain any of the German East African territory of which she is at present in military occupation.) Here again the new frontiers would be entirely wittiunaggressive States like Portugal and Belgium. These changes in the strategico-pohtical configuration of our African territories would, in the opinion of the Committee, naturally facilitate the peaceful development of their resources.14. The retention of German East Africa would secure continuous British territory from the Cape to Cairo.   This continuity might, moreover, prove valuable [358] &apos; C
at some future date by permitting tbe construction of railway lines linking up into a single system the different radial lines connecting the interior with the coast. The economic and administrative advantages of securing this continuity would he considerable. But the Committee wish more particularly, in view of the experience of the present war, to lay stress on the military importance of linking up the different portions of the British Empire by railway, wherever possible.15. The economic resources of the German Colonies in Africa, both agricul-tural and mineral, are also appreciable and capable of considerable development (see General Appendix). Statistics of the trade of the German colonies in Africa, together with an account of the various tariff systems in force in the European possessions in Africa, will be found in a memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade (General Appendix). The Committee hope to present their recommendations as to the economic policy to be pursued with regard to Equatorial Africa when they have received from the Law Officers of the Crown a report as to the precise position of the Berlin Act at the conclusion of the Avar.German South-West Africa.16. The considerations of a general geographical and strategic character, which make it desirable to retainGerman South-West Afriea, have been indicated. South-West Africa is&apos; not comparable to East Africa in agricultural possibilities, though its mineral Avealth is probably very considerable. Its general characteristics resemble those of the adjoining territories of the South African Union, and its incorporation in the Union Avould he the natural sequence to its annexation, even in the absence of the political reasons Avhich put any other solution out of court.17. The conquest of German South-West Africa Avas almost entirely the achievement of the South African Union forces. To refuse South Africa the natural reward of her efforts, and to imagine that she would be satisfied by gains secured for the Empire in some other part of the world, would be to ignore completely the part which local patriotism and local pride play in Imperial affairs.18. But the conquest of German South-West Africa was also an internal victory over the forces Avhich provoked the South,, African rebellion, and Avhichare still a disturbing element in the life of South Africa. The retention and development of South-West Africa would be the final justification of General Botha&apos;s and General Smuts&apos;s policy in the eyes of the majority of their compatriots. Its restoration to the Germans would be their condemnation and the vindication of the rebels. The result would be a situation fatal to the peace of South Africa, and one of Avhich Germany, reinstated as a source of supply and a rallying point for all the disloyal elements in the LTnion, would take the fullest advantage (see Appendix (B)).German East Africa.19. In addition to the general arguments of a strategical and geographical character, which have been referred to in previous paragraphs as making desirable the incorporation of German East Africa in the British Empire, the Committee further desire to point out that this incorporation may make it possible, if hereafter desired, to treat the Avhole of the great region betAveen the southern frontier of Abvssinia and the Soudan to the future northern frontier of the South African Union (whether fixed at the Zambesi or further north) as a single administrative area. This larger British liast Africa has certain general characteristics differentiating it both from the South African Union and from a purely black man&apos;s country like the Soudan or West Africa. It is not likehr to become a white man&apos;s countrv, even in the sense in which thaty  i        - V , ........        .1.    - -- &quot; * . ...expression is used of South Africa. But it is a country which is capable of containing, in the more bracing uplands, a considerable settled element of white farmers, owners of plantations, and directors of industry. It is also a country peculiarly suited, by its climate, economic conditions, and convenience of access, to Indian immigration. The Committee have taken note of the strong representations made by the Government of India for the recognition of India&apos;s claim to colonisation rights in this region. They are of opinion that the provision of some field for expansion Avithin the British Empire cannot be legitimately denied to the population of India, and that the social
and econ ornicf reasons which are advanced to justify the exclusion of Indian immigrants from the self-governing Dominions do not apply to the case of East Africa (see Appendix (B)).20. German East Africa is naturally ihe richest of the German possessions. It has a native population of 7,600,000 (1013 figures), abundant rainfall, a good soil, and very considerable mineral resources. Gold, mica, coal, iron ore, and lake soda are among the minerals which are already worked or known to exist in workable quantities. Of the agricultural products of the country copra, cotton, rubber, coffee, sisal, sugar-cane, rice, maize, and ground-nuts are all capable of great development, while there is a large field for successful sheep and cattle raising in the uplands. In all these respects a great deal of useful experimental and pioneer work has been done by the Germans, the benefit of which will be reaped by their successors. The country has also been equipped by them with much of the necessary plant of civilisation in the shape of good harbours, public buildings, and roads. There are two railways open for traffic. The Central Railway, 777 miles in length, links up the coast with Lake Tanganyika. The TJsambara Railway, 219 miles long, opens up the region between Tanga and Mount Kilimanjaro.21. The importance of the considerations in favour of the retention of German East Africa is clearly realised in South Africa, which is directly interested, in the question of the continuity of British territory in Africa, and which has played so large a part in the conquest of the country. Its retrocession would create profound disappointment in the Union. It would be even more keenly resented by the white community of British East Africa, which in proportion to its numbers and resources has made the very greatest sacrifices in connection -with the war, and has contributed a very material share to the work of overcoming the German resistance. In India, whose troops have also played their part in. this theatre of war, the effect of the reinstatement of Germany would likewise be very unfortunate (see Appendix (B)).22. In dealing with the future of German East Africa the Committee consider that any claims that Belgium may have acquired in virtue of the military operations of her forces in this region should be met otherwise than by a permanent incorpora-tion of any portion of German East Africa in the Belgian Congo. Neither from the point of view of administration or of economic development, nor from the point of view of the welfare of the natives themselves (see Appendix (F)), is it desirable that this region should be divorced from the rest of the territory to which it naturally belongs, and attached as an unnatural projection o  the Belgian Congo.23. The Portuguese have asked for a small rectification of the southern border, which would give them the right bank of the River Rovuma to its mouth.   The Committee consider that more precise information should be secured as to the value of the portion of German territory which lies south of the Rovuma, before it can-pronounce an opinion on this point.The Gameroons.24. Next to German East Africa the Cameroons are economically the most important German possession. Cocoa, rubber, and palm oil are already produced in considerable quantities, and there are great possibilities for the development of many kinds of tropical product. Prom the point of view of political and strategical geography their retention is much less important to ourselves than to the French^ for whom it would mean a great improvement in the configuration of their territories to the north of the Congo. Duala is the natural port for the future development, not only of the Cameroons, but of the French territory further east, viz., Ubanghi and Wadai. Its great possibilities as a naval base would, no doubt, make its inclusion in British territory very advantageous. But the French declared, at the time of the provisional partition in 1915, that they regarded its possession as essential and as a matter on which there could be no compromise, and this presumably represents their view as to the permanent settlement. Nor is it easy to see on what grounds we can assert a claim to Duala unless we are also prepared to extend it to the back country for which it is the natural port of entry.
25. The provisional partition gives us a strip of mountainous country containing some valuable plarjtations and potential hill stations, and should include in British territory the whole of the dominions of the Sultan of Bornu. But a revision, in minor details, of that partition is certainly desirable, more particularly in the latter respect. Jt is evident, however, that the French mean to retain substantially what they now hold, looking upon it as an offset to wrhat we have secured in East xifrica and South-West Africa. On the other hand, if the relative share in the actual military operations is considered, we should be entitled to half, rather than to one-tenth, of the captured Colony or, indeed, even more, -if we chose to lay stress on the fact that the operations could never have taken place at all but for the British command of the sea. The Committee consider that, while we may be prepared to acquiesce in the French intention to retain the whole of the area which they now occupy in the Cameroons,. the provisional nature of the partition should be postulated, in. order, if possible, to secure some quid pro quo elsewhere in return for our eventual acquiescence in its becoming permanent (see Appendices (B), (C), and (D)).Togoland.26. The situation in Togoland is in many respects similar to that in the Cameroons. In this case the French, who only played a very small part in the conquest of the Colony, provisionally occupy nearly two-thirds of its area. We, on the other hand, hold the port of Lome and control the railway system, and are in a much better position for bargaining than in the Cameroons. Our own immediate administrative interests in the adjoining Gold Coast would be met by a rectification of frontier which would include in British territory the whole of the Awuna, Peki, and Dagomba tribes, at present cut in two by a frontier line indefensible from the j)oint of view either of justice to the natives or of efficient administration. The Committee are of opinion that, subject to this rectification, the disposal of the future of Togoland as between British and French should be left as a matter for subsequent bargaining.An Unsatisfactory Peace.27. Taking into account all the reasons given above, the Committee are definitely c of opinion that, in the event of a conclusion to the war which will enable the Allies,.if they wish it, to insist upon retaining the African Colonies, none of these Colonies should be given back to Germany. But in view of the terms of their reference, the Committee feel obliged to consider what are the most vital territories to retain if a partial surrender of the Allied conquests becomes inevitable.28. The Committee are convinced that the retrocession of German South-West Africa is, for the political reasons &quot;already given, absolutely impossible. The political objections to the restoration of German East Africa are hardly less strong, irrespective of considerations of a geographical and strategic character which make its retention a matter of great importance to the cohesion of the British territories in Africa and to the security of our shipping in the whole Indian Oeean. The restoration of the Cameroons would be a serious blow to French plans of reorganising their territories in this region, while for us it would involve the menace of a German naval base at Dual a.29. If any territory has to be restored the Committee recommend, as far as British, interests are concerned, that it should be, in the first instance, Togoland, subject to the rectification of frontier previously referred to; and secondly, the Cameroons. In the latter case France would, however, probably stipulate for the recovery of the areas ceded by her to Germany in 1911. How far any such arrange-ment would involve an obligation on our part to compensate France elsewhere, either in territory or in remission of a portion of her indebtedness to us, would depend on a balancing of the assets acquired by each of the partners oyer the whole field of the war.30. If the situation at the end of the war is so unsatisfactory that even these concessions are insufficient, it might then be necessary to face the possibility of having to surrender the south-eastern portion of German East Africa, iucluding the ports of Lindi and Kilwa, and, if it came to the worst, Dar-es-Salam. The frontier of the reduced Germany Colony would in that event run north-eastwards from the head of Lake Nyasa and then eastwards to the coast, leaving intact a broad belt of continuous British territory between Rhodesia and British East Africa.   Even if the Central
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 22, 1917,Railway could not be retained in its entirety, we should at any rate retain the Usambara line and secure the Uganda Railway from any danger of immediate attack across the frontier. These are, of course, only rough indications; definite suggestions for alternative frontiers in such a contingency could only be put forward with much fuller detailed information than is at present available to the Committee, and after consultation with men of local knowledge. If, however, the Germans were in a position to insist on more, we should at any rate aim at retaining a strip of continuous territory between the present Belgian frontier and a line drawn between Lake Victoria and the head of Lake Nyasa (see Appendix (H)).31. In making their recommendations the Committee have, in accordance with the terms of their reference, confined themselves to the consideration of the German African Colonies taken by themselves. They have not attempted to weigh the relative desirability of retaining any or all of these Colonies as compared with other objectives of British and Allied policy in Europe and elsewhere, and they recognise that their conclusions are necessarily provisional, in so far as they are liable to eventual modification in the light of other considerations not here discussed, or of the general policy of the Allies at the conclusion of the war.(Signed) LOUIS MALLET (Chairman).W.

APPENDIX (A).Memoeandum by the War Office.Brief Summary of Colonial Campaigns in the Present War.I. German South-West Africa.OPERATIONS were considered on the 5th August by a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the chairmanship of Admiral Sir H. B. Jackson. It was decided that the destruction of the wireless installations on the coast, at Luderitzbucht and Swakopmnnd, was essential. On the 9th August, however, the project for operations was extended to include destruction of the newly completed and powerful long-distance German wireless installation at Windhuk, an important link in the German chain. This latter objective involved nothing less than the complete conquest of the colony.On the 10th August the Union Government notified its willingness to co-operate and to undertake the land operations necessary, the Imperial Navy furnishing all the naval assistance required. On the 20th September Union forces disembarked at, and occupied, the German port of Luderitzbucht.On the 15th September the Union officers, Generals Beyers and Kemp, resigned, and published a disloyal manifesto in the Hertzogite press. The treasonable dealings of Colonel Maritz and other Union officers became evident soon after, and portions of the Union forces on the borders joined the enemy. Before the end of October rebellion became general throughout the Northern Free State and Western Transvaal. Preparations for the campaign in (German South-West Africa were greatly retarded, and changes of plan were necessary. By the 11th January, 1915, the rebellion was crushed and the leaders were in custody or disposed of.Early in January the final design of the plan for the invasion of the German colony took shape as follows : (a.) A northern force, to disembark at Swakopmund, strength about 20,000, ofwhom 15,000 mobile, (b.) A central force, portion already disembarked at Luderitzbucht, strengthabout 10,000, mainly mounted, (c.) A southern force, on the Orange River, strength about 0,000, mainly mounted. (d.) An eastern force, to enter German territory on the east at Rietfontein, strengthabout 2,000, mainly mounted.eThe Germans placed some 8,000-10,000 men in the field, well supplied with ammunition, some artillery, and many machine guns ; also some aeroplanes. In spite of the great natural difficulties of the country, owing to the vast distances to be traversed and the lack of water, the greater mobility of the British forces rendered German resistance hopeless, and the principal strategic centres of the country were occupied with comparative ease.On the 12th May our troops entered Windhuk, the German forces and Government retreating north to the border of Ovamboland, after having first violated Portuguese territory and engaged in hostilities with the Portuguese troops. On the 9th July, 19.15, the surrender of the German forces and of the colony was accepted by General Botha.The troops engaged consisted of permanent and specially raised units of the South African Union forces, of Burgher Commandos, of a Rhodesian. battalion, and of a few Naval, Royal Marine, Royal Garrison Artillery, and Army Service Corps details. The maximum strength at any one time was 38,000 40,000 exclusive of a large establish-ment of native and Cape coloured transport drivers.   The English- and Dutch-speaking
elements in the force were in almost exactly equal proportions. This campaign in no way affected operations in the main theatres. The Dutch would not, in any case, have volunteered for service in any other theatre, and it is doubtful if any large number of the English-speaking element would have done so.2. Togoland.On the 5th August, 1914, the German Governor of Togoland advanced a proposal for the neutrality of his territory, which was refused. On the 9th August instructions were issued by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of the Gold Coast for military co-operation with the French troops available in an attack on this German colony, the object of the operations being confined to the seizure of the powerful long-distance German wireless installation at Kamina.On the 12th August a British force disembarked at Lome. The campaign was -conducted with exceptional energy and initiative, and within a fortnight the German colony and the troops surrendered unconditionally (the 26th August, 1914).The forces engaged comprised the Gold Coast Regiment, West African Frontier Force, Gold Coast Volunteers, and Gold Coast Constabulary, about 2,600 in all, exclusive of naval forces employed on the coast and of some French details which co-operated in the interior.8. Cameroons.On the 5th August, 1914, the question of operations against the German Cameroons was considered by the same sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence that considered the operations against German South-West Africa. On the 10th August the French Government notified its readiness to co-operate with naval and military forces, and on the 23rd August notified its willingness to accept the appointment of General Dobell to the supreme command of an Allied Franco-British Expeditionary Force.The initial objective, as notified to General Dobell on the 27th August, provided only for the seizure of Victoria, Buea (seat of Government), and Duala, and the destruction of the wireless installation at the latter place.On the 27th September Duala was surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and two days later (the 29th September) orders, were sent to General Dobell that his objective was to be the complete conquest of the Colony. It then became evident that a prolonged campaign would be necessary. ,The Germans, who were well prepared and well equipped, opposed a formidable resistance and utilised every defensive means. After several temporary set-backs and disappoint-ments, the campaign finally concluded on the 14th February, 1916, on which date the garrison of Mora, in the&apos; North, surrendered. A few days earlier the remnant of the German troops, whose ammunition was exhausted, together with the German Governor and his staff, had passed into Spanish Muni, from whence they were removed for internment to Spain and the Spanish island of Fernando Po.The British troops employed included battalions of the West India Regiment, West Africa Regiment, West African Frontier Force, and one Indian battalion. Maximum strength at any one time about 6,500, exclusive of naval and Royal Marine details operating on the coast. The French forces which co-operated in the expedition consisted of about 8,000 men from Equatorial Africa and Senegal. There was also a small Belgian Congo contingent. The German forces were at their maximum nearly 10,000. The proportion of whites to natives in German native forces here and in East Africa was about one in ten. This is a much higher proportion than in the British or French coloured troops, and accounted largely for the formidable character of the resistance.None of the Allied troops used in this campaign were suited for employment in the main theatres of war.4. East Africa.In East Africa, the largest and in many respects the most highly developed of the German Overseas Dependencies, a really formidable resistance was encountered, and the enemy, though in much reduced force, is still in the field. The campaign has unquestionably involved a serious outlay both of money and resources, though very iew of the troops employed were fitted for the major theatres, and the campaign was a
necessity if the neighbouring protectorates of European Powers were not to be overrun from bases in the German territory.It is typical of German methods that the true range and power of the wireless installation at Muanza was concealed from ourselves and others until it was discovered to be capable of communicating with NTauen without intermediate stations. Other German preparations in this Colony were similarly advanced, and at first the problem of the reduction of the Protectorate was scarcely appreciated either in the War Office or in India, the latter country being looked to for both intelligence and the provision of the majority of the troops required.At first the objective of the operations was merely the capture of Tanga with a view to ensuring the Uganda Railway against an attack from this direction. The attack on Tanga failed, and subsequent operations along the British East African frontier in the early months of the war showed that the force originally sent out was insufficient to ensure the safety of the Uganda Railway. To avert the complications involved in the possibility of a serious German attack on the railway, coupled with trouble fomented in Abyssinia, it became necessary to make an effort to get rid of the German menace. South Africa was appealed to for assistance, and early in 1916 General Smuts was in a position to begin the highly successful but arduous campaign by which the Germans were progressively driven southwards out of one district after another, while Belgian forces from the north-west and a British force from North-Eastern Rhodesia drove their outlying forces south-eastwards and north-eastwards upon the main body. A small Portuguese force also co-operated along the southern frontier. At the moment of writing; the German forces remaining in the field have been confined in the least hospitable portion of their territory, and are short of supplies and transport, though still well equipped as regards small arms and ammunition. The bulk of their field and heavier artillery has been lost or captured, by us.The German forces consisted of some 18,000 well-disciplined and highly-trained Askaris. The British forces, at their maximum, included : Imperial troops, 2 Regular battalions, 11 batteries, and specialist troops of all kinds, as well as Naval and Royal Naval Reserve details operating on the coast and on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria ; the South African Union troops, 2 mounted brigades, 3 infantry brigades, 6 batteries, and specialist troops; Indian troops, Regular, Imperial Service, and Volunteer, 20 battalions and 5 batteries ; lastly, a Rhodesian white battalion, British East Africa and Uganda white volunteer units, and about 20 battalions of King&apos;s African Rifles, West African Frontier Force, Rhodesian Police, &amp;c. ; in all, about 69,000 men, exclusive of an equal number- of native carriers. The white and Indian troops are being withdrawn as rapidly as possible, and their places are being taken by new battalions of King&apos;s African Rifles, Matabele battalions, &amp;c. The Belgian forces, nominally 20,000 strong, have probably never exceeded a total of 12,500 effectives.The only troops employed in this campaign who could have been utilised in France were the 2 Regular battalions and the South African Infantry. It is, however, uncertain how many of the latter would have volunteered for service in Europe. Practically all the Indian troops employed were either Mahommedans of a class which could not have been used against the Turks, or were of such inferior value that they could have been used in no other theatre.War Office,March 1, 1917.
APPENDIX (B).Memorandum by the Colonial Office.BY the desire of the Chairman, we have prepared a Supplementary Memorandum expanding the arguments in our Memorandum of the 14th September, 1916 (T.C.-5), in so far as it deals with the German Colonies in Africa.I. German South-West Africa.It was stated in the first Colonial Office memorandum that political considerations of the most imperative kind required that German South-West Africa should become British.   It may be convenient to explain more in detail why this is so.The outbreak of war found South Africa governed by a Dutch Ministry. Not only were all the Ministers, with two exceptions, themselves Dutch, but the leading men in the Ministry, General Botha, and General Smuts, had taken a leading share in the resistance offered by the Transvaal to the British conquest. The memories of the South African war were not dead, and, as the rebellion which broke out in September 1914 showed, there was an active section among the Dutch, who thought that the time had arrived, with German assistance, to cut South Africa loose from the Empire.The Union Government, however, never at any time wavered in its loyalty to the Crown.. Rejecting all idea that South Africa could remain neutral, on the 4th August, 1914, the Union Government telegraphed offering His Majesty s Government to take over most of the duties of the Imperial garrison. Mr. Harcourt telegraphed in reply as follows: &quot; If your Ministers at the same time desire and feel themselves able to seize such part of German South-West Africa as will give them the command of Swakopmund, Luderitzbucht, and the wireless stations there or in the interior, we should feel this was a great and urgent Imperial service. You will, however, realise that any territory now occupied must be at the disposal of the Imperial Government for purposes of an ultimate settlement at the conclusion of the war. Other Dominions are acting in similar way on the same understanding.&quot;Ministers answered, cordially agreeing to co-operate, and after the rebellion had been suppressed General Botha undertook the South-West Africa campaign, which, except for the assistance rendered by the Navy and some help with the artillery, he conducted to a successful issue entirely with South African resources.It will be observed that according to Mr. Harcourt&apos;s telegram quoted. above and the Union reply (both of which have been published inCd. 7873), German South-West Africa remains nominally at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Nobody, however, in South Africa doubts that the Union will acquire South-West Africa. Thus the Union Minister of Finance, in his budget speech on the 31st March last, estimated that the rebellion had cost the Union in direct loss 5,100,0001., and that from the outbreak of war up to date 15,000,0001. have been spent in prosecuting the war.   He added : &quot;We have acquired assets far exceeding the 15,000,0001. by our expenditure on this war, and therefore, bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind also that our expenditure will not only give us these direct results, but will enable us to be placed in a position to be entitled to have some voice, when peace comes, our expenditure is shown to be not extravagant.&quot;It need hardly be said that General Botha and his Government have been the object of the fiercest attack on the part of the extremist section.   To men like Maritz [358]- E
and Beyers it seemed to be an absolutely unique opportunity for undoing the work of the South African war, and many who never came out in rebellion objected to the Scuth-West African campaign, and still sympathise with the defeated rebels. All these people are busily engaged in trying to undermine General Botha&apos;s influence, and if South-West Africa is returned to Germany at the end of the war, they will claim N triumphantly that the result.has vindicated their objections to the expenditure of South African blood and treasure on a wicked and useless expedition. General Botha has staked his political existence on his decision to carry out, in the spirit as well as in the letter, the pledges given by him at Vereeniging. It is an obligation of loyalty as well as of Imperial interest not to throw him to the wolves. For to surrender South-West Africa would, in fact, be nothing else.It may be added that, whatever Government is in power in the Union, South-West Africa, in German hands must be a danger to the Union. Not only would invasion be possible, but (as was, in fact, shown in the recent rebellion) a German administration must be a standing peril as a source of supply of and a rallying-point for all the disloyal elements in the Union.II. German East Africa.It was stated in our Memorandum that public opinion, both in South Africa and British East Africa, would be strongly opposed to any handing back of German East Africa.So far as South Africa is concerned, it is necessary to recall the circumstances in which troops were sent from that country to East Africa. After the reverse at Tanga in 1914 the British forces in British East Africa were compelled to remain on the defensive, and the Protectorate was for over a year in considerable danger of invasion by the Germans. Owing to the heavy demands which were being made on our military resources by the campaigns in other countries, there was no prospect of obtaining further assistance for British East Africa except possibly from South-Africa. The difficulties of the. Union Government have already been explained in Part I, but General Smuts engaged in a vigorous recruiting campaign, and eventually raised a large force of South Africans. In his opening speech, delivered to a mass meeting at Cape Town on the 22nd November, 1915, he emphasised the urgent need of South African assistance in order to complete the work of&quot;, driving out the German flag from South Africa, and pointed out that South Africa was not protected by the Monroe Doctrine, like America, by distance, like Australia, by forces of reserve power, like Asia, and that therefore it was a special call to, and the clear duty of, the Union to see territory in Southern Africa inviolate against the designs found in a &quot; Greater Germany.&quot;General Smuts and the South African troops have in fact taken a leading part in the conquest of German East Africa. The credit and reputation of General Botha and his Government have been staked, though it may be less obviously than in South-West Africa, on the conquest of East Africa, and a conquest followed by a retrocession would be regarded by public opinion in South Africa as an expensive failure, for which it would be very difficult to find adequate justification.His Majesty&apos;s Government must, in short, having invited the assistance of the Union, abide the result of their action. It is morally impossible for them to give up German East Africa without obtaining the consent of the Union, and that consent, it is safe to sa*y, would only be given under the pressure of necessity.So far as British East Africa is concerned there is probably no section of the Empire which in proportion to its numbers and resources has made greater sacrifices in connection with the war than the white community in that country. After years of struggle and disappointment the settlers had recently attained a certain measure of prosperity, but, on the outbreak of war, a large proportion of the men of military age left their farms and businesses without hesitation and enrolled themselves in the local forces. Compulsory military service was spontaneously adopted by them at an early date before, indeed, it had been adopted in this country their whole weight was thrown into the struggle and, from their knowledge of local conditions, their assistance has been of the utmost value. There can be no doubt that they confidently expect that German East Africa, for the conquest of which they have made such heavy sacrifices, will be retained by this country. Should this expectation not be realised the effect on the white population would be deplorable, and the difficulties of the local administration, at all times considerable, would be greatly increased.Attention was drawn in our previous Memorandum to the objections to the
retransfer of the natives to German rule and to the loss of prestige which British rule would suffer by such an event in the eyes of the natives.generally. These arguments apply to all the German Colonies in Africa, and are dealt with in greater detail under the Heads of &quot; Cameroons &quot; and &quot; Togoland.&quot; We would merely observe here that there is undoubtedlv a very powerful body of public opinion in this country which, on humani-tarian grounds alone, is strongly opposed to the retransfer of those Colonies to their former owners. In this connection it may be added that many of the surrendered German askaris are being enrolled by General Smuts, and if we are to hand them back to the tender mercies of their former masters our action will not only be keenly resented by the natives, but will probably be stigmatised as base ingratitude by public opinion here. -We also referred in our Memorandum to the competition in armaments which would ensue between the British Protectorates in East Africa and German East Africa if the latter were handed back at the end of the war. Both the East Africa Protec-torate and Uganda are new and imperfectly developed countries, and it is of the highest importance, not only in their own interests but in those of the Imperial Government, that as large a portion as possible of their funds should be devoted to reproductive work, such as the development of communications, &amp;c, and that they should be placed at an early date on a permanently self-supporting basis. If they are burdened with largely increased military expenditure their position will become a difficult one, and the)&apos; will probably require heavy grants-in-aid from the Home Government.Finally we referred to the vulnerability of the Uganda Railway. The General Staff, in their Memorandum of the 22nd September, 1916, agree that this is a matter of great importance, and we would only point out that, although many successful attacks were made on the section of the line between Mombasa and Nairobi, with considerable damage to rolling-stock and permanent way, the injury done was trifling compared, with what might have resulted from attacks on the section between Nairobi and Lake Victoria. In the former section there are no viaducts and no important bridges, but in the latter there are no less than twenty-seven steel viaducts, many of which are of considerable magnitude. If one or more of these were seriously damaged in time of war, repairs would be very difficult to execute, and the consequences, both from a military and economic point of view, might well be serious.. There are two additional points to which reference was not made in our previous Memorandum. -The first of these is referred to in the telegram from the Indian Government of the 8th. September,. 1.916 (Appendix A, to India Office Memorandum), in which they state that, &quot; As regards German East Africa, whatever may be its eventual administra-tion, we trust arrangements to admit of Indian emigration on equitable lines may be made.&quot;As the Committee are no doubt aware there have been serious difficulties in connection with the emigration of Indians to the Colonies. Both the Imperial Govern -ment and the Government of India have for years been endeavouring to find some solution of the question and, in view of the part played by India during the war, it is more than ever important that a solution should be arrived at as soon as possible. There can be no doubt that the situation would be greatly relieved if an outlet for Indian emigration could be found in a country which, as in the case of German East Africa, is of large extent, is thinly populated, and is apparently suitable for Indian settlement.The second point is that both Belgium and Portugal will certainly raise the strongest objections to the reoccupation by Germany of territory adjacent to theirs in Africa, as they would in that event be exposed to retaliation from their formidable neighbour, whose attitude towards them was by no means conciliatory even before the war.III. Cameroons.The Western frontier of the Cameroons coincides with that of Nigeria for between 700 and 800 miles. Nigeria is the largest British dependency (exclusive of India) not possessing responsible government. It is also by far the most populous of any of the British dominions or colonies, having about 17 millions of inhabitants; Canada (the next in population) having about 8 millions. Before the war its revenue was about that of Ceylon. A large proportion of the inhabitants are Mohammedans, under the immediate control of important Emirs, whose authority it is the policy of the British Administration to uphold.
These few facts are mentioned in order that the importance of the British Dependency adjoining the Cameroons may not be overlooked.The British land forces engaged in the Cameroons campaign were composed of West Africans, and of these the greater part were drawn from Nigeria. The whole of the campaign in the North was carried out by the Nigerian Regiment under their Commandant, and the operations by sea could hardly have been so promptly and successfully completed had it not been for the assistance in craft and personnel given by the Nigerian marine.The campaign therefore concerned Nigeria more than any other West African Colony, and its successful conclusion was naturally regarded by the soldiers and by the Chief and Emirs (whose loyalty was most satisfactorily tested) as due to the valour of the Nigerians -which to a considerable extent it was. .There can be no doubt whatever that the return of the Germans to the Cameroons would be a very severe blow to British prestige throughout Nigeria. The Chiefs, both Mohammedan and Pagan, are accustomed to see the conquerer take over the land of the conquered, and the general opinion would no doubt be that, whatever we might say, we had not beaten the Germans. When the greater part of the Cameroons was given to the French by the &quot;provisional&quot; partition of February last, it was thought that it might cause some dissatisfaction among the natives, but this was not the case, possibly because a sufficiently wide strip was allotted to us along the frontier to satisfy those who were nearest to us, and familiar with German methods, of the advantages of a change of masters.   As for the rest, at any rate the Germans had been got rid of.As there are no white troops in Nigeria and only a small native force, we depend there largely on prestige; and should the Cameroons revert to Germany, which would probably be followed by an aggressive attitude of the natives restored to their rule in the frontier regions, it would involve a reconsideration of the whole military policy in the Protectorate.If the Cameroons had been conquered solely by British forces, the position would be somewhat similar to that of German South-West Africa; but the objections to its return to Germany, though grave, would not be so overwhelming, although it is likely that the French, whose territories adjoin the Cameroons on the other two sides, would have agreed to its retrocession with great reluctance and only under pressure. But the actual situation is entirely different.The share of the French in the land operations in the Cameroons was quite as large as ours, and they, no doubt, consider that it was larger. A part of it consisted in the recovery of the large tracts of country ceded by them to Germany in 1911, which must mean a great increase of their prestige among the natives, who have now returned to their old allegiance. With this part of the operations, and with the whole of their campaign in the Eastern and Southern Cameroons, British forces had nothing whatever to do. The French are therefore peculiarly interested in the Cameroons, the onky one of the German Overseas possessions in the conquest of which their forces have plaved an important part, and where they have expended much money and many valuable lives.It is abundantly evident, from the negotiations which took place in connection with the provisional partition of the Cameroons, that the French have every intention of retaining at least the portion they now hold. This was shown early in the campaign, when we could not get them to agree to anything like an approximate half-and-half partition; the reason, of course, being that, owing to the geographical position of Duala, that all-important port would inevitably have fallen to us, and they no doubt felt (as we feel now) that no matter how &quot; provisional&quot; the partition was called, the holders of Duala would probably remain there. Later on they made no attempt to conceal their intentions. In the report of the conversation between M. Cambon and Sir E. Grey, contained in the despatch to Lord Bertie of the 24th February, 1916, it is stated: &quot;He&quot; (M. Cambon) &quot;told me that the French Colonial Party were very excited. Early in the war we had asked the French to have a force ready to help us in East Africa. They had kept one ready in Madagascar. Then we had said that we did not require it, and it had been used elsewhere. Lately, without saying anything to the French, we had decided to undertake large operations in East Africa. As to the Cameroons, Duala was the only possible port for French Central Africa, seeing that the French could not take one of the ports of the Congo. There was really no other outlet for them, whereas we, for our corresponding possessions, had outlets in Nigeria, and Duala was therefore vital to the French..
M. Cambon told me [that he had recommended that the territory belonging to the Emir of Bornu should not.be divided, and that if we gave Duala to the administration of the French, they would drop their demands about German East Africa.&quot;M. Picot used the same arguments at the meeting of the Foreign Office on the 23rd February, when the French proposals for the partition of the Cameroons were put forward. He said that the possession of Duala by the French (l was essential, and that on this point there could he no compromise.&quot; And when he was drawing the line of demarcation between the British and French spheres, he insisted on retaining a certain road on the ground that it was a line which would be followed by a railway to be constructed to the north.It is not to be supposed that the dissatisfaction of the French Colonial party would be assuaged by the possession of Duala and the greater part of the Cameroons during the period of the war only, or that a great scheme of railway construction could have been contemplated in a territory which the French did not expect to hold permanently.As regards the possible return to Germany of the narrow strip of mountainous territory left to us by the &quot; provisional&quot; partition of the Cameroons, it is not worth serious consideration. It would be for the most part useless to the Germans ; to hand it back would be very disquieting and a blow to our prestige in Nigeria, and would be most objectionable to the French.Although, as is shown above, the great improbability of the French being disposed to return any portion of the Cameroons to Germany must be fully recognised, it does not follow that, in negotiations with France,.we should accept the reasons which.led to the existing partition as justifying a permanent transfer to the French of the territory now provisionally allotted to them. If the relative shares in the conquest are to be taken as governing the future, then they could not possibly claim more than half the Cameroons (instead of about nine-tenths), and in view of the work of the Navy, this would be more than their fair share. If they keep Duala, they ought to have less than half, owing to the great value of that port. The arguments brought forward at the time of the provisional partition, based on the attitude of the French Colonial party, were possibly of weight at the time, but they should not, we. submit, be given special consideration in connection with a general and permanent settlement. In other words, although we may know that the French fully intend to keep what they have got, it is not to our interest to make them a present of it, and we should keep alive the &quot; provisional&quot; nature of the partition in order that we may, if possible, obtain some quid pro quo in return for our acquiescence in its being made permanent. As far as can be seen at present, we have not got very much in the way of territory to offer to France, if such an offer should hS necessary, as part of a general settlement. The same considerations apply (with still greater force) to Togoland, in the reduction of which the French forces played a very small part.IV. -Togoland.The objections to returning Togoland to Germany are to a considerable extent the same as have been pointed out in the case of the Cameroons. In Togoland French forces played a very small part in the campaign, but the French now administer (provisionally) nearly twice the area which was allotted to the British, who, however, hold Lome (the port) and control the railways.The question of the future of Togoland was discussed at considerable length by the Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Hugh Clifford^ in a Memorandum written in October 1914, from which the following extract, dealing with a possible retrocession to Germany, is taken :  i! The existing boundary between Togoland and this Colony and its Depen-dencies is eminently unsatisfactory. However convenient it may have appeared to the two European Governments concerned at the. time of delimitation, it unquestionably entailed a cynical disregard of native rights and of native settlement.&quot; As at present drawn this boundary-line cuts off a portion of the country belonging to and inhabited by the people of three important tribes from the rest of the country peopled by them and also from their Paramount Chiefs.   These three tribes are the Awunas in the extreme south, and on the coast, whose Fia [358] F
resides at Kwittathe Pekis, further to the north in our Trans-Yolta districts, whose Fia resides at Peki-Blengo; and in our northern territories the Dagomba tribe, whose Paramount Chief resides at Yendi in Northern Togoland.&quot;This grievance is one of very long standing-nearly twenty years old in fact -but it is as fresh in the minds of the people to-day (vide paragraph 58 of my despatch No. 746 of the 7th October, 1913), as though the settlement between Great Britain and Germany had been arrived at yesterday.&quot; The German officials across our border have not contrived to make their rule popular. This is due in part to their system of direct taxation e.g., poll-tax, &amp;c.  and partly to the martinet character of their rule. Their local nickname of the &apos; Twenty-fivers &apos; an allusion to the frequency with which they were accustomed to resort to corporal punishment was not given to them without reason. The arrival of our troops and officers in Togoland was, therefore, everywhere welcomed by the native population ; but the spontaneous. expressions of enthusiastic delight which our occupation of Togoland elicited from the Awunas, Pekis, and Dagombas, is to be ascribed not only to their preference for British as compared with German methods of administration but also to the great satisfaction with which the reunion of their divided tribes was regarded by them.&quot; If Togoland were hereafter to be restored to Germany, such action would be strongly resented by the entire native population of the Gold Coast and its Dependencies, but especially by the Awuna, Peki, and Dagomba tribes. There is also only too much reason to fear that the natives of Togoland, who have acted loyally by us, would fare badly at the hands of a restored German Government. As an instance of how loyal they have been I may mention that in the Misahohe district, which marches on our Peki country, the chiefs and people voluntarily brought in, and handed over to our Political Officer, 1,000 muskets, which the German Provincial Commissioner, Dr. Grunner, had given to them wherewith to resist our Forces.&quot;[Here follow suggestions as to possible rectification of boundaries.]&quot; There are three other points which call for consideration in connection with the suggested restoration of Togoland to Germany.&quot; Firstly, there can be no doubt that, even though the war had terminated in the triumph of our arms, the restoration of Togoland to the German Government would be a very serious blow bo our prestige among the natives of this Colony and its Dependencies, and no amount of argument or persuasion w^ould avail to con-vince them that Great Britain had, in fact, emerged victorious from the trial of strength. This, added to the very acute sense of grievance which such restoration would, in any event, engender in the Awuna Tribesmen, would be highly regrettable, viewed from the standpoint of the local Government, and might quite conceivably be fraught with evil consequences in the future.&quot; Secondly, the Government of Togoland, I am informed by M. Nouffiard, the Lieutenant-Governor of Dahomey, has constantly proved itself a very bad and troublesome neighbour to his Government. Pvelations between ourselves and the German Colonial Government of Togoland have of late been of a very friendly description, but Administrations whose theory and practice of government, as , applied to large native populations, are based upon such widely divergent principles, as are those of Great Britain and Germany, cannot but find themselves in frequent disagreement over incidents occurring upon their frontiers. In September of last year, for instance, an Awuna woman was first shot and then clubbed to death by a German police patrol for breach of quarantine regulations, of which no notice had been given to our local officers, and of which our border natives had received no notification. No adequate redress was obtained from the Government of Togoland for this outrage.&quot; If at the conclusion of the war Togoland were to be restored to Germany, there can be little doubt, I think, that the German Colonial Government would speedily prove itself an even more undesirable&apos; neighbour, both to the Gold Coast and to Dahomey, than it has been in the past; and the Administration of the Gold Coast would further be subjected to the humiliation of seeing natives of Togoland,. who had acted loyally towards the British Government, treated with great severity, what time we should, of course, be powerless to intervene on their behalf.&quot; Thirdly, though this is a matter of Imperial rather than of local importance,
it most, I think, be recognised that the principal value of Togoland to Germany-consisted in its central position on the west coast of Africa and on the shores of the Atlantic for the purposes of communication by wireless telegraphy. The gigantic installation at Kamina, which is reported to have cost between 200,000Z. and 250,000Z., was only completed in August last, and was completely destroyed before the end of that month. It is certain, however, that during the first days of the war it was instrumental in warning German shipping in the Atlantic of the position of affairs, and it is probable that it thus saved Germany considerably more money than had been expended upon its construction. . Is His Majesty&apos;s Government prepared to place the Government of Germany in a position to repeat this coup f&quot; To sum up, then, the restoration of Togoland to Germany at the end of the war is, judged from the standpoint of the local Government, exceedingly inexpedient. There is also the Imperial and strategical objection, last noted, to be urged against such a course. If, however, it be decided to restore Togoland to Germany, a rectification of frontier in the Peki and Dagomba country, and, as far as circumstances admit, in the Awuna country also, should be insisted upon.&quot;Sir Hugh Clifford ha*s recently written on the subject of the German wireless station at Kamina (see paragraph 16 of Memorandum quoted above) urging in the strongest terms that in no circumstances should Germany be permitted to re-establish herself where she would be in a position to reconstruct this station.H.

Confidential.)My Lord, Foreign Office, February 24, 1916.TO-DAY I mentioned the subject of the Cameroons to M. Cambon.He told me that the French colonial party were very excited. Early in the war -we had asked the French to have a force ready to help ns. in East Africa. They had kept one ready in Madagascar. ..,Then we had said that we did not require it, and it had been used elsewhere. Lately, without saying anything to the French, we had decided to undertake large operations in East Africa. As to the Cameroons, Duala was the only possible port for French Central Africa, seeing that the French could not take one of the ports of the Congo. There was really no other outlet for them; whereas we, for our corresponding possessions, had outlets in Nigeria, and Duala was therefore vital to the French. M. Cambon told me that he had recommended that the territory belonging to the Amir of Bornu should not be divided, and that, if we gave Duala to the administration of the French, they should drop their demands about German East Africa.I told M. Cambon that our colonial feeling was equally excited about Duala, which apparently was the only port of the Cameroons; but the matter had been discussed with the Prime Minister and some of my colleagues, and we had come to the conclusion tlrat, as the South African Union wras already in possession of German South-West Africa, we ought to accept with as little qualification as possible the French proposals about the Cameroons. We would, therefore, accept M. Picot&apos;s proposals, asking only that the territory of the Amir of Bornu should not be divided, and should go to us for administrative reasons, and that not only British merchant vessels, but British ships of war, should be able to rise Duala during the war.M. Cambon cordially agreed with both these conditions, and I understood from him that he thought his Government would authorise him to settle on these lines.I said that I was speaking only unofficially, because the official negotiations were being carried on by M. Picot with our experts ; but I wished M. Cambon to know the difficulties that wre had had with regard to Duala, and the reasons that had moved us to agree to the French proposal.I mentioned that all occupation of German colonies was provisional till the conclusion of peace.I am, &amp;c.E.

APPENDIX (E).Letter to the Chairman from Sir H. McMahon.My dear Sir Louis, January 12, 1917.WITH reference to our conversation of the other day about foreign colonies and possessions, I write these few lines to amplify the views I expressed on the subject of German possessions in Africa. /I refer especially to East Africa, because German West Africa did not affect us in Egypt, except so far that after the capture of that country we received welcome rein-forcement from there in the form of officers (General Dobell and others) and troops who did excellent work in our Western desert.German East Africa did affect us, and that very inconveniently, in several ways,, direct and indirect: 1. Our initial defeat there, which disclosed the strength of the local German.forces, necessitated our sending to East Africa some of the Indian troops defending the Canal.2. The possibility of being called upon to send further reinforcements there and elsewhere was urged upon me by the Commander-in-Chief, Egypt, as one of the reasons which prevented his undertaking the urgently-needed expedition to cut the Hedjaz Railway line from Akaba.3. Operations in East Africa deprived India of the troops which were and still are urgently needed to drive the Turks out of our Aden territory.(2- and 3 have had a prejudicial bearing on the Arab movement by impeding its progress.)4. The fact that all available forces in Uganda and British East Africa were fully occupied with the Germans in East Africa added considerably to the anxiety which the Mohammedan movement, brought about by Germany in Abyssinia, caused me in regard to the Sudan, where our small force was then wholly occupied with the operations in Darfur^All this has brought home to me very strongly the danger which German East Africa would have been to us had the Germans had a few^ years more in which to strengthen their position and forces there, and it indicates the still greater danger which German East Africa will be to us at some future time if we allow Germany to remain there and make use of her past experience.Similar conditions, mutatis mutandis, doubtless obtain in the case of German West Africa, but of this I cannot speak from personal knowledge. As far as East Africa is concerned, I am most strongly of opinion that we should not, and must not, allow Germany to remain there after the war.APPENDIX -(F).German East Africa.I. Note by Mr. E. P. Spanton entitled &quot; Some Considerations as to the Effect of a return to German Eule in East Africa/&apos;II- Note by Mr. E. F. Spanton entitled &quot;Some Notes on the Treatment of the Natives in German East Africa.&quot;I.   Some Considerations as to the Effect of a return to German Rule in East Africa. 1. From the point of view of British Prestige.THE defeat of the British force at Tanga in November 1914 produced a disastrous effect upon the minds of the natives of East Africa, For many months after this fight it was constantly said that the English were women, who did not
know how to fight, and though the success of the present invasion has done some-thing towards removing this impression, Tanga has not been forgotten, and large numbers of the natives are inclined to believe and to fear that the story they Lave been told by the Germans may be true, viz., that they are now withdrawing from certain parts of their colonies because they are wanted to fight for their Emperor elsewhere, and that when the war is over the English, who are only old women and cannot fight, will not be able to prevent them from returning.The treatment of the British prisoners of war as slaves of the Germans has also produced a tremendous effect upon the native mind,- which so much admires strength and despises weakness.It will be understood that the bad impression referred to cannot be confined to the territory until lately German. News, and opinions about it, spread far and rapidly in Africa.2. From the point of view of the English Missions,The Universities&apos; Mission to Central Africa was working in the country for nearly twrenty years before the Germans occupied it, and their right to work there without interference Avas duly recognised in the course of the negotiations of 1889.The return of German rule after the present war would appear to involve the destruction of this work ; it is hardly to be hoped that English people could live and work under the German flag in Africa, at least for many years to come. Even were it to be conceived as possible that permission would be given by a German Colonial Government for English missionaries to work in their territory, it cannot be doubted in view of what we. have seen of their recent methods that they would render such work practically impossible.3. From th)e point of view of Justice to the Native Races.The Germans have shown themselves incapable of ruling the African people; they have treated them with brutal cruelty and injustice. The natives have had a foretaste, on more than one occasion, during the last year of what they would have to expect if they were made subject to the Germans when the war is at an end. German forces have retired before British advance guards, and have, subsequently, again occupied their previous position, as the British iell back ujjou their main body; when this has happened the natives have been massacred by the returning Germans for having sold food to the English while they occupied the district, and certainly in one case, for having been glad that the English came.ERNEST F. SPAN TON, Principal of St. Andrew&apos;s College; Zanzibar.January 22, 1917.II. Some Notes on the Treatment of the Natives in German East Africa.1. Treatment by the Germans.Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, some of the teachers of the Universities&apos; Mission to Central Africa, who were working in the north of the colony, were arrested by the military authorities, and within the first six months, after a systematic search for those teachers in the north who were not at first made prisoners, practically the only worker of the mission still at liberty was a sub-cleacon, wrho had been put in charge of the mission station at Maalabani, near IVlheza. He remained there until the occupation of this part of the colony by the English troops.The teachers in the south of the colony, in the Rovuma district, were not made prisoners until 1916, for the most part, and I have no information as to how they were treated after their arrest.The teachers from the north wrere compelled to march some hundreds of miles across country under miserable conditions. Many of them were in chains, and com-pelled to carry burdens, though weak and ill, and they were all subject to very rough usage from their guards, both coloured and white. Some of them were taken to Kondoa Irangi, where a considerable proportion of them died, the remainder who survived
were removed to Mrogoro. The others, who had not been sent to Kondoa Irangi, were imprisoned at Tabora, where we frequently saw them, and received news both of their own condition and of that of their fellows who were at Mrogoro. No charge was ever brought against any of these men, but they were regarded as prisoners of war, because, though German subjects, they were adherents of the English Mission. They were confined in camps with coloured prisoners taken in action, and with other natives suspected of treason and similar offences. When the Belgians were on the eve of taking Tabora, the rest of the native prisoners (i.e., those taken in the field and the suspects) were carried off into the bush, but the mission teachers were set at liberty.In December 1914 a charge was made against one of the Euglish Mission clergy (Reverend IT. A. Keates) of having signalled by means of acetylene lamps to the English troops. (Whether to those who invaded Tanga in November 191^, or to those on the British East Africa border, never transpired, but in either case the charge was equally absurd, as Mr. Keates never possessed an acetylene lamp, and it -would have been quite impossible in any case to have made such signals over the distances involved.)The Germans tried to induce some of the mission teachers to perjure themselves by telling a story which was suggested to them in support of the above charge. When they refused they were harshly used and threatened with death, but as they still refused (and as no acetylene lamp could be found), the charge against Mr. Keates was dropped, and the teachers in question were not further interfered with, but were treated like the others who had been made prisoners.A somewhat similar instance of the same kind of thing arose in connection with a charge against two of the Church Missionary Society&apos;s missionaries (Rev. Dr. West-gate and the Rev. E. W. Doulton). They were accused of having taught the natives in the Ugogo country something of heliography, of having given them an instrument with which to signal to the invading British force, and of having inspired communica-tions which were to be sent to the British. The whole story was taught to the natives, who were told to repeat it as evidence, and they were very severely flogged to induce them to do so. Under the influence of the floggings two of the natives gave the evidence required of them, a third, who refused, received over 100 lashes ; the two false witnesses, when confronted with the English missionaries before a judge, blurted out the whole plot, and, after much bullying and cross-examination, it was found that no threats of further punishment could shake their evidence. The charge, therefore, fell through, like the one alluded to above, but was revived a little later, and a second trial took place before a new judge.   The matter was then dropped.Many of the German Askaris, and practically all porters, required for transport, were recruited by the following simple process. Parties of soldiers were sent out into the villages (they were generally timed to arrive at night when the people of the village were likely to be caught in bed) to seize all the young men. They fastened them together somewhat in the fashion of the Arab slave raiders of older days, and drove them to the nearest fort. They were confined in a fort, or, more frequently, in a camp, and were told that any attempt to escape would be punished with death.The porters engaged in transport work were consistently treated with the greatest brutality. When a man fell exhausted under the weight of his load, he was flogged until he staggered to his feet and stumbled on again. Those who were too weak to do this were shot as they lay.&apos; Eor example, one of the German officers with the column retreating from the Ruanda country before the advancing Belgians, wrote in a private letter: &quot; Our road is paved with the corpses of the natives we have been, obliged to kill.&quot;2. Treatment by the Belgians.The Belgian forces entered Tabora on the 19th September, 1916, and that night the town was a pandemonium. Belgian Askaris wandered about the streets with loaded rifles, looting the native houses in all parts of the town, carrying off the women and threatening to shoot the men -who protested against the loss of their wives quite a considerable number of men were actually shot in the immediate neighbourhood of Tabora by marauding Askaris during the two or three wreeks that followed the occupa-tion of Tabora. After the first night the state of affairs in the town itself was somewhat better, for police patrols were sent out regularly, but it sometimes happened that these patrols were themselves guilty of loot and violence. The Belgian officers, when appealed to, generally expressed their disapproval of these proceedings, but professed themselves unable to control their troops.   It was commonly stated that
these native troops had been got to Tahora by the promise of unlimited loot and unlimited women as soon as they should arrive. On our march north from Tabora towards the lake we found everywhere in the Belgian sphere evidence of this sort of brigandage. Villages had been burned, crops destroyed, and the people had fled; as soon as we passed into the British sphere we found things untouched, and the natives came to our camps, eager and willing to sell us produce. The first night out from Tabora we camped near Itaga, a mission station of the White Fathers. Of the mission village not one of its seventy houses remained, and the Father Superior told me that on the previous Sunday three young mothers of his people had been carried off and their babies thrown into the bush. On the morning of our arrival a man had been shot for objecting to the rape of his wife. Not only had food been stolen in wholesale fashion, but the food stores had been burned in a spirit of wantonness.Native Feeling in (German) East Africa.(1.) Before the War. The people of Ruanda (the province in the north-west of the colony) were a constant source of anxiety to the German authorities; they had never dared to attempt to collect hut tax from them. When the war broke out a branch of the Central Railway, to run north from Tabora, was being surveyed. Its purpose was, perhaps, partly commercial, but chiefly to enable the Germans to control the Ruanda people.The people in the north of the colony (Bondei, Shambala, Zigua, Masai) were distinctly pro-English, and longed for the day to come when they should be under British rule. The same may be said of the large tribe of Wagogo, who lived north and south of the Central Railway, centring round &quot;Dodoma.The people of the south-east might be described as anti-German, and, in conse-quence of their treatment by the Germans, perhaps anti-European. The Wanyamwezi and kindred tribes centring round Tabora were, on the whole, probably the most loyal to the German administration. These people are ruled by powerful Sultans and Sultanas, whose friendship the Germans were at some pains to cultivate.(2.) During the War.-The Germans&apos; methods of dealing with their own native-subjects during the course of the military operations, caused those sections of them who were inclined to be disloyal to dislike the German rule more than ever, and it became thoroughly unpopular with all classes of people, some of the troops excepted. Great pains were taken to conciliate the native troops. Their rate of pay was largely increased, they were granted privileges denied to the rest of the people, and were allowed to rob and to tyrannise pretty well as much as they pleased. Yet, as the war dragged on, large numbers of them became thoroughly disaffected, and talked openly of their hope that the English would , come quickly and bring the wrar to an end. Many of them had to be flogged into action, and seized every opportunity to desert.In view of what has been said above as to the attitude of the Wanyamwezi before the war, the following evidence is significant as showing the result of the behaviour of the Germans upon the most loyal of their native subjects. In the summer of 1916 the Governor called a conference of the Sultans of the Tabora district, at which he was refused more men, either for military or for transport purposes; for some days the attitude of the natives was such that a revolution was openly spoken of and seriously feared. As a matter of fact, the Muhammadan Sultan of Tabora approached some of the prisoners with a scheme for the massacre of the Germans, as a means of freeing his people from a tyranny they could no longer bear, and was only induced to postpone his project by the assurance that the British or Belgian columns would very shortly arrive and drive the Germans from his country. The people of Tabora were prepared to welcome the invading forces, and to help them by every means they could; what has been said above as to the behaviour of the Belgian native soldiery will explain the modification of their attitude which was to be noticed after the Belgians&apos; arrival.The English, however, have been welcomed everywhere, and regarded by the people as delivering them from slavery.ERNEST F.

APPENDIX (G).Future Administration of German East Africa.Letter addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies by the Universities&apos;Mission to Central Africa.Head Office, 9, Dartmouth Street, Westminster, Sir, London, February 12, 1917.IN consideration of the approaching termination of military operations in the colony hitherto known as German East Africa, and of the occupation of the colony by the forces of the British Empire and its Allies, we, the Committee of the Universities&apos; Mission, humbly approach you in the interests of the native inhabitants of the country. We have, some of us, been witnesses in recent, years of the cruelties wrought by Germany on the native tribes living under her rule. The whole story of the German occupation of East Africa from the beginning is a record of oppression. Certainly much has been done in the development of the land in the interests of the German settlers, but the native rights have not been considered. The native has no rights in German eyes.   What is to be the future of the colony ?Either wholly or in part it will be given back to the German Empire, or to Portugal or to Belgium, or it may remain,; in its entirety, under the British flag.In the interests of the Africans, any one of these results except the last would be deplorable. The native would, probably, not be any better under Belgian than under German rule, and our experience is that he might be even worse off under the Portuguese.It is not for us to suggest who eventually ought to possess the land, but we feel entitled very strongly to press the point that it should not be retained by Germany, nor handed over to either of the other two Powers. Christian missions, both British and French, for half a century have worked in this vast district, to the advantage of the native tribes, educating them, training them, developing them; and our own Universities&apos; Mission was at work there twenty years before German East Africa existed. All this work would, presumably, come to an end if the colony passed from British rule.Therefore, in the interests of humanity, in the interests of the Christian religion, and in the interests of the defence of the native races, we pray that the protection of Great Britain, or of some Power other than German, Portuguese, or Belgian may be extended over this country; that it may not be handed over to those who would crush out our native life, and check the development of what might, in the future, be one of the great races of the world.yy^g are &amp;c.

APPENDIX (H). -Considerations Based on Prospective Development oe Aviation.Letter from General Brancker to the Secretary, covering a Memorandum prepared in the Military Aeronautics Department of the War Office.War Office, Adastral House, Victoria Embankment, February 8, 1917.I ENCLOSE a memorandum on the subject about which you spoke to me a couple of days ago. I agree with it generally, but have not time to go into details. There is no donbt at all that aviation is going to have an enormous influence in the future. Now is our time to look ahead, and, by our demands when peace is being-considered, earn the blessings and praise of coming generations. The memorandum goes fairly far ahead, and there is little doubt in my mind that the Azores are going to play a very important part in aviation in the future. I mention the Azores particularly, because it seems to me that the rest of the paper is absolutely clear, and is hardly open to argument.Yours sincerely,W. S. BRANCKER.Memorandum by Major B. 0. Fellows.. 1. The subject-matter of this paper deals with the problem of inter-continental transit by air, which is one which cannot be dissociated from the considerations of territorial adjustment which must inevitably follow the conclusion of the present hostilities.Broadly, the aerial considerations involved can be divided into two categories : (a.) Routes immediately available;(b.) Routes available in (say) three to four years&apos; time.. This division is rendered necessary by the constant and progressive advance of aerial science, which enables us to foresee possibilities which, at the present moment, might, by those unversed in current progress, well be claimed as visionary.2. Considering (a), i.e., &quot; Routes immediately available,&quot; we must, for this purpose, take either Egypt or India as our starting-point, and it is the aim of this paper to show that, with certain territorial readjustments, an aerial belt connecting Australia, Straits Settlements, Burmah, India, Aden, Egypt, Central Africa, and South Africa is now a working possibility.A scheme has already been launched for starting an aircraft industry in the East; for the present, the exigencies of the present conflict fix its locale in Egypt, but it may well be that the greater facilities^ for the supply of both raw material and labour will, when peace dawns, demand its transfer to India.For our present purpose, we will assume Egypt to be the strategic centre, and from here two main lines of aerial transit radiate (1) to South Africa, (2) to India with an ultimate extension to Australia. -* The main considerations to be envisaged in considering the feasibility of any aerial route as a practicable factor, under present conditions, are : (a) an ample provision of landing grounds throughout the selected route, (say) one for every 100 miles, and (b) the institution of lighthouses for night hying.Let us now deal with the two immediately available routes seriatim bearing in mind the above considerations : 1. Egypt to South Africa. We already have an all-British route, except for the strip of German East Africa intervening between British East Africa and British Central Africa. To obviate this break, it is suggested that that part of German East Africa lying between Lake Tanganyika and a line drawn from the South-Western point of Victoria Nyanza to the Northern point of Lake Nyassa should be acquired ; roughly, this means the acquisition of a belt of territory 1,000 miles long and 150 to 200 miles broad; this would leave to the Germans their important up-country station of Tabora.2. Egypt to India and ultimately to Australia. This presents a less facile problem, and means rights of landing and the establishment of posts in un-British territory.
Recollecting that we are still considering the problem from the point of view of (a), i.e., &quot;Routes immediately available,&quot; the only practicable one at present must follow some such line as follows : (1.) Egypt to Port Soudan.(2.) Port Soudan via Massowah and Italian Eritrea to Assab, and thence to Perim and Aden.(3.) Aden to Muscat, thence across the Gulf of Oman, and Eastward along theSouthern Coast of Baluchistan to Karachi. (4.) Inter-communication in India and Burmah is easily assured. (5.) Burmah to Singapore.(6.) Singapore via the Dutch Islands to Timor, and thence to New Guinea and Queensland.The practicability or otherwise of the above presupposes the acquisition of certain rights over the alien territory traversed ; these rights will be largely of a temporary nature, as will be obvious when we visualise in the succeeding paragraphs the same routes under conditions which appear in all likelihood to have developed in four years&apos; time.As conditions are, it means we must have facilities for landing grounds in Italian Eritrea, in the country occupied by the generally hostile Arab tribes from Mokalla to Oman, in Muscat, and thence presumably we can pick up the line of stations which will connect Basra with Karachi along the Northern shores of the Persian Gulf.From India onwards to Australia the scheme is more visionary, and is probably impracticable beyond Singapore till the possibilities of long-distance flying have sufficiently developed to enable us to use Borneo and New Guinea, with an intermediary landing station in Gilolo or Celebes. From Burmah to Singapore no great difficulty exists, as it merely means the acquisition of two landing grounds on the Isthmus of Lagor between Tenasserim and Penang, and thence an all-British route exists to Singapore.3. To turn to (o), i,e., &quot; Routes available in (say) three to four years&apos; time.&quot;The problem of inter-communication between Egypt and [South Africa remains unchanged, whilst Egypt to India and Australia will present new features and possibilities.First let us consider the feasibility of the desert route from Suez, via Akaba, and across the Arabian desert to Basra ;* if, as has been contemplated in the past, a railway is built on this route, this certainly becomes our most direct route to India, and enables us to use a land route throughout. There are many factors in its favour, and it is at least equally practicable to the alternative and not much shorter line from Aden along the South Arabian Coast to Muscat and Jask.To Singapore, the conditions remain unchanged, but, as previously pointed out, from thence onwards to Australia, we should be able to use Borneo and New Guinea, with only one alien landing-ground in Gilolo, Celebes, or one of the adjacent islands.4. In conclusion, let us glance for a moment at the altogether wider prospect of inter-communication by air, which, the increasing range of modern aircraft renders possible.Is it to be gainsaid that the crossing of the Atlantic is outside the region of possibility ?In all questions governing the future control of the North Atlantic trade routes, we are confronted by the potentialities of the Azores, whether as a base for aircraft or submarines, and their possession would appear crucial to the existence of our power, both from a naval and aerial point of view.Given the possession of the Azores, the Power which holds them may be said to command not only the North, but the South Atlantic Sea routes.Gibraltar, the Azores, Bermuda, and St. Vincent (Cape Verde Islands) may be said to form an aerial quadrilateral meet in the future to play their part after the-fashion of the old land fortresses of days gone by.B. C. FELLOWS.February 8, 1917.Note. The writer of the memorandum is, of course, unaware of the terms of the agreement with regard to Asiatic Turkey (T.0.-6), which will presumably secure to Great Britain flying rights to Mesopotamia both from Egypt and from Haifa.printed at the foreign office by c. r harrison-29/3/1917.
