Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET...... *G.-144. rSTATE PURCHASE OF THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.Memorandum by the Hov, Waldorf Astor, M.P.A War Measure.STATE purchase is needed for the more successful prosecution of the war, to. economise man-power, shipping, land transport, and to get the maxium of efficiency.   ;,As regards the beer trade, the recent Home Office conferences show that no real; economy of man-power, transport, and fuel can be effected as long as it remains in private hands.   Purchase or Prohibition alone will give this.   Nationalization would, enable very appreciable economies to be made, and would not be as unremuuerative as Prohibition,   Even if it were possible, voluntary amalgamation would be dangerous,, as involving the creation of a powerful Trust and Monopoly in private ownership.       ;Shipping.There is a shortage of spirits for munitions.   Unless potable spirit in bond is used (see separate memorandum attached), either grain, molasses, or West Indian spirit must be imported.   Both the Wheat Commission and the Shipping Controller&apos; urge that this shipping should be saved by redistilling the raw whisky in this country.Railways, &amp;c.Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee.on the Restriction of Imports stated that : &quot; A great waste of transport power is caused by the carriage of beer on the railways. Barrels are bulky, and different brewers will not use each other&apos;s barrels, so that each barrel which is sent out from the brewery full makes a return journey as an empty. Beer is often sent to distant places ; instances have been cited of the supply of beer from Scotland to places in the south-west of England. This contributed to the congestion on the railways, and so reacts upon imports, since our ability to import depends largely on the number of voyages ships are able to complete during the year, and therefore on the efficiency of the ports and of the railways behind them. Moreover, if the railways were free from congestion, the use of home materials in place of imported materials (such as timber) would be facilitated, with double benefit from the point of view of tonnage and from exchange.&quot;The 1(1,000,000 standard barrels now allowed would produce about 13,750 bulk barrels if the gravity were reduced to 1,010 (Carlisle strength is 1,03.8). As about 15 per cent, of the beer is transported by rail, this means 1.950,000 barrels, or 390,000 tons or 108,333 railway truck-loads. Beers must continue to be sent over the country regardless of the location of breweries so long as trade connections and private interests have to be maintained. State management in Carlisle has relieved the railway of 1,100 tons per annum.About half the beer not sent by rail is delivered by mechanical and one-half by horse transport. The same streets and roads are traversed by vehicles belonging- to different firms who, in order to supply their own tied houses and customers, must pass by the houses of customers oi: their trade competitors. A reorganisation would enable one Cart or lorry on.its round to;cover the whole of the customers in one area. Such an economy of transport and of labour would give a corresponding saving either in fuel or in horses (as well as the oats, hay, &amp;c. thev now consume). [473-1]
Man-power: Redundant Public-houses and Braveries.There are some 100,000 licensed houses in Great Britain (or 130,000 in the United, Kingdom) with an average staff of four to five persons (including the wife).   From., two to four persons might be released for every public-house closed.   Lord d&apos;Abernon estimates (G-.T.-297) that at least 30,000 houses could be closed almost at once.The average brewery does not work up to more than two-thirds of its capacity even in normal times, and much concentration of business could be effected.With national management it is estimated that the business of the thirteen breweries which at present exist in Birmingham could be done by four, with a saving of some 1,000 to 1,200 employes. Again, it is estimated that in Liverpool ten small breweries could be closed, releasing 50 per cent, of their employes, the balance being required by the remaining three firms to meet their increased trade. Such a centralisation would liberate 50 carts, or 25 motor lorries, 100 delivery men, and railway rolling-stock for about 55,000 tons, as well as the truck or possibly canal boat space required for the 275,000 barrels, which, when empty, now have to be returned to Warrington.The Board of Trade estimate that during the period October to December 1916 202,800 males were employed in malting, brewing, and in public-houses, hotels, &amp;c, of whom 49,500 were of military age. A large number, coupled with a big percentage of the 147,700 women employed in-these trades, might be released to replace younger and fitter men and women in other businesses.Lord D&apos;Abernon estimates (G-.T.-297) that over 60,000- men and the same number of women could be liberated.If there is ever to be a drastic closing of public-houses and breweries, the present moment is favourable. The displaced men and women could, in most cases, readily find employment. After the war the labour market may be flooded and their prospects would be precarious.Fuel.By closing the unnecessary and small redundant breweries a real economy of coal and coke could be effected, as a large brewery consumes 20 to 30 lb. less coal or coke per barrel than a small one.Board of Control.The Board of Control (Liquor Traffic), appointed to increase national efficiency, recommended in December 1916 that the State should purchase the whole of the interests connected with the Drink Trade.Subsequently the Board represented to the Cabinet that, if the Food Controllers proposals were carried out, State purchase should be introduced as soon as possible. They explained that this conclusion had been reached because purchase alone would (a) provide the best machinery for controlling spirits, (b) recoup most effectively the State for any loss in Excise revenue, (c) cause the decreased brewing material to produce the maximum volume of beer by reducing gravities to a greater extent than could be done by the Trade under private control, (d) release far more men for essential trades, (e) provide the greatest economy for transport, and (/) distribute the beer fairly and equally.Demobilisation and Reaction.Unless the future of the drink traffic is now settled, all concerned in that Trade must keep up during the war a vigorous campaign, involving an expenditure of cash, energy, and labour, in order to maintain their post-war prospects.The risk of reaction after the privations of war is considerable.   Already the Trade are preparing a campaign to sweep away all restriction just at a period when their retention may be essential.   A Trade paper states that &quot; every parliamentary candidate &apos; will be invited to state his views, and the Trade will support, entirely regardless of their political complexion, those pledged to remove the present temporary restrictions.&quot;Spirits.The war-time prohibition of spirits, which is strongly advocated in Scotland on the ground of efficiency, would be facilitated by purchase.
Finance.        , .x .   ,;The Liquor Control Board have had several estimates submitted to them, which range from 240,00(),000Z. to 370,000,0001 The Board pointed out to the Cabinet that Suppression of licences, concentration of businesses, the reduction and economical use of land transport would result in a large saving of working expenses ; and that, in their opinion, no apprehension need be felt as to the effect of the proposed reform on the annual revenue of the State. *Although the Treasury would be committed to finding the capital (Government Stock) after the war (say, any time up to three years after the declaration of peace), practically no cash need be found now, as far as the beer trade is concerned.During the war breweries might be pooled and run by a Trade Committee under Government control and direction, all breweries, whether closed or not, receiving a pro rata share of the total pooled profits earned by the breweries remaining open. (It is estimated by some brewers that owing to the decreased cost of production due to amalgamation and to present high wages and prices of beer the profit even on the 10,000,000 barrels would almost equal the pre-war profit made by the Trade). The Trade could not find the whole of the compensation for dispossessed licences, a Treasury contribution would be needed, but the amount involved is not great.Should the submarine campaign compel a further considerable reduction on the 10,000,000 barrels, or even total prohibition, the above scheme would have to be altered. The Trade might, under these altered conditions, be given a yearly advance out of the capital due after the war.W. ASTOR.
