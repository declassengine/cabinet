G.-117.ENEMY   PEINCES. Parliamentary Pledges.(Extracts from Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons.)Mr. Swift MacNeill asked the Prime Minister (1) whether, having regard to the July 27, fact that the rank, style, and dignity of Royal Highness, Prince of the United Kingdom 1916-of Great Britain and Ireland, and G.C.V.O., now possessed by His Royal Highness the Duke of Albany, a traitor in arms against the Sovereign and people of these countries, are held subject to the pleasure of the King, and the titles of G.C.B. and G.C.V.O., now held by His Highness Prince Albert John Charles Frederick Alfred George of Schleswig-Holstein, now also in arms against the Sovereign and people of these countries, are held subject to the pleasure of the King, and are conferred or taken away by the exercise of the Royal prerogative on the advice of the Ministers of the Crown, he will, having regard to the conduct of those princes in becoming public enemies of these kingdoms, by whose people they were maintained and educated, advise His Majesty the King to deprive them of these honours, ranks, and dignities which they disgrace; and (2) why have not their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Cumberland, Teviotdale, and Earl of Armagh, and the Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence, and Baron Arklow, traitors in arms against the Sovereign of these countries, and in the line of succession to the Throne, been deprived of their peerages by letters patent or statute, or any other powers, and of their vested rights on certain contingencies of succession to the Throne by Act of Parliament modi-fying the provisions of the Act of Settlement, which have been frequently modified, the modification generally being in the interests of Germans ; and whether he is aware of the indignation aroused by the protection or immunity given to traitors in high positions, and the construction placed on such seeming preference tc private and personal, as contrasted with public and Imperial, interests ; and will he take steps for the removal of such mischievous impressions ?Sir A. Markham asked the Prime Minister whether, with a view of allaying the sense of disgust felt by a large number of loyal subjects of the Crown at the Duke of Albany and Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein who are in arms against the Sovereign and the people of these countries, he will advise the Sovereign in the exercise of his Royal prerogative to deprive these persons of the various titles, rank, and precedence which they hold at the pleasure of the Crown, and which are accordingly revocable at such pleasure ?The Prime Minister : The Cabinet have had this matter under consideration, and ice are, as I said some days ago, in full sympathy with the feeling of the House on this subject. His Majesty will be advised to take the necessary steps, both as regards titles and orders, and the technical questions involved are being considered by the Lord Chancellor.Mr. Lynch : Will it be necessary to introduce a Bill ?The Prime Minister : I have stated that the question will be considered by the Lord Chancellor.Official Report, Vol. 84, cols. 1863/4.Mr. Lynch asked the Prime Minister whether he has a Bill in preparation destined October 31, to remove from the Peerage and from citizenship in this country those Members of the 1916-House of Lords, for instance, German princes, who are now in arms against the Allies ; if not, why is this not to be done; and if so, why the introduction of the Bill is   . delayed ?Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1917.
Mr. Bonar Law: The exact--form-which the necessary legislation should take is now under consideration by the Government, and we hope to introduce it without undue delay probably in another place.        ..........   4 ...   -    ..;j , Mr. Lynch : May I ask why there has been this delay ? There has been more vtime wasted in answering questions than would have been necessary to pass a Bill through the House ?Vol. 86, col. 1515.Mr. Lynch asked the Prime Minister whether he will submit to the House a state-ment giving the names of all the Members of the House of Lords who are now in arms against the Allies, together with the amount of the pensions the payment of which may be still due to them, and also a statement of the services to this country which have placed them in a position of special privilege ?Mr. Bonar Law : It is, I am informed, doubtful whether the Dukes of Cumberland and Albany whom I presume the honourable Member has in mind are actually Members of the House of Lords. I do not know of any other persons in arms against us who could be considered Members of that House. The answer to the second part of the question is that no such payments are due, and the third part therefore does not arise.Mr. Lynch : May I ask the right honourable gentleman, on this point of doubt whether they are really Members of the House of Lords, he will see fit, if they really are Members of that House, to remove them from that position, instead of protecting them, as the Government has been doing ?Mr. Bonar Law : I have just read the answer that it is going to be done.Mr. Lynch : Yes, but there was a point of doubt.Vol. 86, cols. 1515/16.Mr. Lynch asked the Prime Minister whether he can now name a date for the introduction of the Bill dealing with the.case of enemy princes who are Members of the House of Lords.The Prime Minister : I hope this Bill will be introduced in another place very soon, but 1 am afraid I cannot yet name the precise date.Vol. 87, col. 203.Mr. Lynck asked the Prime Minister whether he is yet in a position to give the date on which will be presented the Bill dealing with German enemy princes.The Prime Minister : The Bill is being drafted, and as soon as it is ready it will be introduced, as I have already informed the House, in another place.Mr. Lynch : When the Bill is introduced, will the right honourable gentleman undertake to keep a House, as a count out is now a method of protecting German princes ?The Prime Minister : As I have said, it will be introduced in another place, over whose proceedings I have no control.Vol. 87, col. 1415.On the Motion for the Adjournment, in answer to Mr, Swift MacNeill,Mr. BonAR Law said: I am afraid I must, like some of my colleagues, claim privilege as a Member of the new Government because I have not had time to look into this matter. I understand that what the honourable ^Member asks was promised by the late Government. If I may say so, I share in this matter the prejudices if they be prejudices-. of the man in the street, and I can assure the honourable gentleman that the question shall have my best attention.Mr. MacNeill : I am quite satisfied with that.Vol. 88, col. 985..
Mr. Lynch : Is it the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill dealing Dec. 18^ with enemy princes? *Mr. Bonar Law : It is not the intention to introduce a Bill this session, I promised the honourable gentleman who raised this question the other day that it will he gone into. That is being done, and there will be no delay beyond what is unavoidable.Vol. 88, col. 1130.In answer to questions by Mr. Lynch and Mr. Swift MacNeill with regard to Dec. 19, enemy princes having seats in the House of Lords, and other enemy princes holding 191^ titles,Mr. Bonar Law said: As I have already explained, the Government are not in a position to deal with this matter before the recess; but I have undertaken that, with this reservation, there will be no delay.Mr. MacNeill : Is the right honourable gentleman aware that so far back as the 27th July last the late Prime Minister promised me on the floor of this House that legislav tion would be instantly instituted, and that he likewise promised me that other gentlemen would be struck off the roll of knighthood. That could be done by a stroke of the pen, utterly irrespective of Parliament. Why is the House to be trifled with any longer in; this way ?Mr. Bonar Law : During the ten days or so of the existence of this Government we have not had time to deal with anything that does not arise in connection with the war.Mr Lynch ; Will the right honourable gentleman remove the impression which prevails in this country that these men are being protected on account of their relationship ?Mr. MacNeill : It was stated that there were difficulties in relation to that Bill, I believe there are none. Will the right honourable gentleman consider a Bill I have prepared myself, and that I would bring in to-morrow if I were allowed ? I ask him to take this Bill and lay it before the Law Officers of the Crown.Mr. Bonar Law : I shall be extremely glad to get the Bill, and I have no doubt it will be of assistance to the officials concerned in the matter.Vol. 88, col. 1298.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 23, 1917.
