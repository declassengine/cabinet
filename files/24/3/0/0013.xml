THE Royal Italian Government trusts that the British Government will come to an agreement with Italy regarding Maritime Freights, so as to ensure the same advantages as those accorded to France by the Convention signed in London last December by Mr. Runciman and M. Clementel.While trusting that, following on a full and concrete exchange of views and proposals between the competent authorities of the two countries, this agreement may be concluded as soon as possible, the Royal Italian Government has the honour to present to the British Government the following requests, which are considered of. particular importance and urgency in order to meet the imperative needs of the moment: r1. Extension of ci.f. freights for coal on Admiralty steamers (now limited to 50,000 tons per month) to the total quantity of 125,000 [?] tons of coal monthly, which amount, according to the agreement arrived at in London last October, the British Government has agreed to cede to Italy on the spot at requisition prices.2. Allocation of surncient tonnage for the transport to Italy of wheat, maize, rice, and other cereals to meet the requirements shown by the data already in the possession of the competent departments of the British Government, in addition to the limited amount of tonnage assigned up to date for the shipment of these products to Italy.3. Conversion to time-charter of all the sixty-four licences (both time-charter and single voyage) granted up to date by the British Government for British steamers employed direct by the Italian Government or by private Italian firms.4&apos;. Supplementary allocation of sixty British steamers on single voyage licences ; such steamers to be directed, - voyage by voyage, to Italy for the transport pi coal. These sixty steamers represent the English tonnage which, in normal times, has always been employed in the free coal traffic with Italy, but which have in part failed it of late.5. Revision of the agreements for coal freights from England to Mediterranean ports, as follows : (a) The rate corresponding to the insurance premiums against war risks to be..excluded from the freight, such insurance to be borne by the charterers. . (6.) All Aided Mediterranean ports, including those of North Africa, to beincluded in the Schedule of Maximum Freights, (c.) Efficacious steps to be taken for the exercise of compulsion in regard to neutral steamers which were employed in the free coal traffic with Italy up to the 30th October, 1916, so as to*keep them in that trade.6. That the details for the execution of the Agreement relating to the chartering of foreign steamers through the International Committee be fixed so that the allocation of tonnage requested by the Italian Government and private Italian firms may be guaranteed proportionately, with the total requests and offers received by the said Committee./. ^Management and direction of neutral steamers engaged on time-charter to beSECRET.G.-112(A.)MARITIME FREIGHTS.Translation of a Memorandum by the Italian Minister of Transportreferred to G.-112.Printed for the use of the War Cabinet.

exercised exclusively by the chartering Government, without the intervention of any Shipping Agencies through which such chartering may have been effected.8. Conditions for the transport of ores from the Mediterranean to England by the Italian Government to be fixed on the same basis as those governing the transport of coal from England to Italy effected by the British Government.APPENDIX I.Notes on the Italian Memo randtjm by Mr. Roydon.IN view of the very serious deficit on Government requirements, it is extremely undesirable to enter into fresh commitments as to the future provision of tonnage. The agreement with the French on the 3rd December has already proved extremely embarrassing, and will probably have to be modified.1. In October the Admiralty agreed to buy 125,000 tons of coal on behalf of the Italians, but the provision of tonnage at Blue Book rates was not extended to more than 50,000 tons a month. It is presumed that the request in this paragraph is merely that tonnage will be provided at Blue Book rates in replacement of British chartered vessels. In that case the question is purely a financial one, and will, it is presumed, be supplied by the Treasury.2. The supply of wheat to Italy is controlled by the Wheat Executive, who, in conjunction with the Transport Department are endeavouring to help the Italians so far as possible to meet their requirements for wheat, and maize as a wheat substitute. For maize as a cattle food, for rice and other cereals no responsibility at present exists, unless they are used in reduction in the supplies of wheat It is impossible in the present tonnage situation to give the Italians any promise of assistance with regard to the transport of rice and other cereals, the supply of which even to this country is far from assured.3. The sixty-four licences to which the Italians were originally entitled has by this time been reduced by war losses, &amp;c, to fifty, representing thirty-six time-chartered vessels, and fourteen voyage-charters. The Ship Licensing Committee are strongly opposed to the concession of these fourteen voyage-charters to time-charters.4. It is quite impossible to agree to the Italian request for the supplementary allocation of sixty vessels on voyage charter for the transport of coal to Italy. The tonnage position at present is that every tramp which can load by the end of February has been requisitioned, except those which are already in the service of France or Italy, those which are exempt from requisition as having been brought from neutrals, as having escaped from the Baltic, &amp;c. (most of which are, in any event, already serving France or Italy, or doing equally important work), and a few others, which are doing work of such obvious importance that they could not be taken. Proposals are now before the Cabinet for making a substantial reduction in the liner services carried on by British vessels, but it must be remembered that any steps taken to secure further vessels now can only mature after the end of February, and that in addition to the requirements now notified, the large additional requirements for Russia will be putting further strain upon tonnage from the beginning of April onwards.0, 6, &amp; 7. The Board of Trade (in conjunction with Trade Division as regards C). These paragraphs have been referred to the Board of Trade.With regard to 7, however, the present arrangement works well, and in view of the arrangements made between the Transport Department and the Italians for the use of neutral vessels to convey ore on the return voyage, it would appear undesirable to make any change.8. The proposal made in (8) requires elucidation, and seems to be a matter for discussion between the Italian Delegation and the Controller of Shipping. Its financial aspect concerns the Ministry of Munitions.The present arrangements in regard to the conveyance of iron ore in&apos;vessels requisitioned or chartered by the Italian Government to carry coal are as follows: Italy has provided Italian tonnage to the extent of 25,000 tons of ore a month, in consideration of which the Ship Licensing Committee has allowed certain British yessels time-chartered to Italy to return in ballast.
About October last, the Italian Delegation agreed, after great pressure, to load ore cargoes in the maximum possible number of their national steamers under requisition. They were guaranteed against any loss of importing capacity by a promise of additional British requisitioned tonnage in an agreed proportion.As the ore situation grew more serious, it was necessary to press the Italian delegates to load ore in their chartered tonnage also, whether neutral or British, which was returning to the United Kingdom in ballast. They were given a similar guarantee against a loss of importing capacity, and it is understood the Ministry of Munitions also agreed to guarantee them against any net financial loss on the operation, after any saving in freight on the additional quantity of coal carried at British Blue Book rates had been taken into account.The guarantee as regards tonnage is being fulfilled, and the shipment of coal is in advance of that of ore, in consequence of the recent agreement to give Italy additional ships for coal.APPENDIX II.Notes on Paragraphs 5, C\ and 7 of the Italian Memorandum, prepared in the Marine Department of the Board of Trade.5. THE question of revising the agreement for coal freights from England to Mediterranean ports is now being considered by the Inter-Ally Chartering Committee, ou which the Italian Government have representatives. The three points (a), (6), and (c) mentioned in paragraph 5 have already-been raised by the Italian representatives on that Committee, and these questions can very well be left to be dealt with by the Committee. This Inter-Ally Committee meets several times a week at the Board of Trade.6. The request here is that the Italians may be given their fair share of neutral steamers controlled by the Inter-Ally Chartering Committee. The Italian Government have their representatives on that Committee, and they can see that Italy gets her fair share.7. This again is a question to be determined by the Inter-Ally Chartering Committee, on which the Italian Government have representatives. It is not expected that there will be any difficulty in this request being complied with.January 19, 1917.o
