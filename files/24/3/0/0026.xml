SECRET.G.-121.POSITION IN REGARD  TO GOVERNMENT TIMBER PURCHASES.I. Memorandum by Sir Alfred Mond. II. Minute and Memorandum by Sir Lionel Earle.HAVING accepted on the 16th instant the position of Chairman of the International Commission on Timber Purchases, I wish to draw attention to the very serious state of affairs created by the Treasury instructions contained in their letters dated the 5th and 12th instant, wherein we are asked to restrict purchases in Scandinavia and the United States of America.The statistical position regarding supplies is, shortly, as follows: Average requirements in sawn timber for war purposes 43,500 standards a month (or 522,000 standards a year (exclusive of poles, pickets, and rough timber).It is estimated that the following quantities can be obtained without purchasingin Scandinavia or the United States of America : * Standards.

materially increased. The Scandinavian and United States of America markets therefore remain essential&apos; for the provision of the necessary timber for wa; and munitions purposes. The amount of surplus stocks in the country which can be commandeered would undoubtedly last for a few months, after which the position would be an extremely dangerous one, as we should have to rely on being able to purchase timber, obtaining tonnage for, and obtaining delivery of timber without interruption, and the whole of these large quantities from Scandinavia and the United States of America without any increase of the present demands.I would submit that no apparent justification exists for running such a very grave risk of shortage in a material of such vital importance in the conduct of the war. The two reasons put forward in virtue of the cessation of forward purchases in the United States and Scandinavia are, firstly, the question of exchange, and, secondly, the question of tonnage.As regards the question of exchange, I would point out that the purchases by outside merchants far exceed those made by the Government. Apparently the outside merchants are able to find the means of financing their purchases and dealing with the exchange problem. I am informed by the Government buyer that he would undertake, if the Treasury puts at his disposal the amounts required in sterling in London, to deal with the exchange. The Treasury objects to this course, on the ground that it would disturb the work of the Exchange Committee as far as Sweden is concerned. In reference to this point, I would submit that the large quantity of exchange required for private purposes, which is not under Treasury control, in itself prevents that regulation of exchange through the Exchange Committee which the Treasury thinks desirable, and that unless this is eliminated no real control of exchange can be obtained.I would further point out that Sir Lionel Earle, on his recent visit to France, had arranged in Paris for a joim Franco-British-Swedish loan for 4 0,000,000 to 60,000,000 kronors, on what appeared to me and to him very reasonable terms. The carrying through of this transaction was, however, stopped by the Treasury, for reasons wrhich have^been explained to me. I am inforn ed that it is apparentb. easier for the French Government to arrange loans in Sweden than the British Government, owing to the fact that the French have not been so immediately concerned in the blockade and are regarded with more friendliness by the Swedish Government. Further, there are more Swedish securities held in Paris as cover for a loan than in London.As regards the American exchange. Iam not in a position to offer any opinion ; but I cannot think that the relatively small amount of money required for timber purchases, in view of the other very large commitments, seriously affects the question.Secondly, regarding the question of tonnage, I am informed, in respect to the Scandinavian market, that the bulk of the material is carried in neutral bottoms, and the cessation of imports would therefore not liberate British tonnage, nor would there be apparenth any guarantee that the neutral tonnage just liberated would be available for the Allied purposes. On the other hand, as I have already stated, the dangers jinvolved are, in my opinion and that of my advisers, of the most serious character ; and I cannot accept the responsibility for allowing matters to remain in their present position without definite instructions from the War Cabinet on the question. I (Signed)        ALFRED MOND.His Majesty s Office of Works,January 26, 1917The First Commissioner,I attach a memorandum wdiich I think sets forth clearly the necessity for purchasing timber for purely war purposes in both Scandinavia and the United States. In view of the Treasury instructions (copies of letters attached), I think the matter should be considered and instructions as to our future action given by the War Council. The explanation as regards the increased purchases of pitch pine and sleepers accounts for the recent increase of purchases in the United states referred to in Sir Robert Chalmers&apos; letter of the 12th instant.As you know, I had practically arranged in Paris for a joint Franco-British-Swedish loan for 40,000,000 to 60,000,000 kroner on what I think reasonable terms, but, for reasons unknovMi to roe, the Exchange Committee did not see their way to agree to this prop- sal. Meanwhile the Treasury appear to me to be unable to solve the Swedish exchange question, which has been proonnently before them for the past four or five
months. Perhaps you will consider it advisable to lay the whole facts before the^ War Council, as I do not think the War Timber Commission can guarantee to supply timber for the various war demands, under the conditions laid down in Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s(Signed) LIONEL EARLE.January 18, 1917.Soft timber for the requirements of the armies in France, and for War Office, Ministry of Munitions, and Office of Works requirements at home, is purchased from money placed at the disposal of the Office of &quot;Works out of the Vote of Credit. An International Commission, with British (Office of Works, Admiralty, War Office, and Ministry of Munitions), French, and Belgian representation, exists for collating the above requirements and those of the French and Belgian Governments, and bringing them into relation with the home production of Great Britain and France. The latter is being developed in both countries to the utmost, but it is still necessary, and will always be necessary, to obtain much the greater part of the British requirements from abroad. Purchasing abroad is done by the Office of Works&apos; buying agent in consultation with French and Belgian representatives, the basis of the purchases being the indents for timber received from the armies in France and from the various Departments.Recently the Treasury have instructed the Office of Works to restrict its purchases of timber in Scandinavia (particularly Sweden) and the United States of America within the narrowest possible limits, in view of difficulties connected with the exchange. The desirability of refraining from purchasing in neutral countries has always been borne in mind by the Office of Works in its operations in timber, and for this and other reasons purchasing in Scandinavia and the United States has never been undertaken unless it appeared to them that failure to obtain the timber would prejudice the carrying out of essential services. Indeed, for the first seven months of last year they kept out of the Scandinavian market altogether, and quite recently they have expressed their inability to execute an order for o00,000 60-centim. track sleepers because they could onl\ be obtained in the Gulf of Mexico.It is desirable therefore to explain what timber is purchased in these countries, the purpose for which it is used, and why it cannot be obtained anywhere else.*1. Pitch-pine.Pitch-pine can only be obtained in the Gulf of Mexico. It is demanded chiefly by the Inland Water Transport Department and the &quot;Director of Railways, France. The demands amount to about 1,500 standards a month, the f.o.b. value being approximately 15,000Z.A special order for about 4,500 standards of pitch-pine (f.o.b. value 45,000Z.) is now in curse cf execution for making railway waggons urgently required for the railway sei vices in France. It was at first intended to use &quot; railway-waggon oak,&quot; which itself is a special oak, to be obtained onl) in the United States of America, but it was not obtainable in the time, and in any case, the cost would have been greater.2. Sleepers.Sleepers can be obtained from many sources. They are being cut in as large quantities as possible by the Home-grown Timber Committee in the United Kingdom, and by the Canadian Forestry Battalions in France. They can also be imported from the White feea, from Spain, Portugal, and the United States of America.They are required in large quantities, and are Used for various purposes (trenches, roads, railways, &amp;c.) in France, Salonika, and Egypt. A small quantity is also required by the military authorities and by the Ministry of Munitions in this country.The average monthly demands for all purposes were until recently about 175,000 a month, and arrangements had been made to obtain these without purchasing in the United States of America. But since November last additional demands have come forward for about 4,000,000 sleepers for railway services and roads in France, and, in spite of every effort to increase- the production of the Home-grown Timber Committee and the Canadian Forestry Battalion in France, and to exhaust all other sources of supply (the White Sea being now closed), it has been necessary to purchase some 1,200,000 sleepers in America, f.o.b. value about 150,000L
3. Plywood.Pljwood can be obtained from Canada and the United States of America only.It is used by the Ministry of Munitions for diaphragms for ammunition boxes,, which are, of course, being made in large quantities now to meet the requirements for the spring offensive.The demands amount to about 477,500 ft. super a month, f.o.b. value about 14,500Z.The limited amount of plywood which can be obtained from Canada has proved most unsatisfactory and unreliable, and there is no alternative but to obtain it in the United States of America.4. Sawn and Planed Fir.Planed and dressed fir (which is used in construction work for flooring, &amp;c.) can be obtained only in Scandinavia.Sawn timber (which is used largely for trench work and also for hutting in France, and for the rougher construction work, roofing, &amp;c, in this country), can be obtained from the White Sea, from Scandinavia, from the United States, and from Canada.The demands for both amount to about 8,000 standards a month for this country, and to about 18,000 standards a month for France.For the present the White Sea is closed, so that nothing can be obtained from that source. As regards Canada, the St. Lawrence ports &quot;are closed, and only the eastern ports (St. John and Halifax) are available, and the amount which can be lifted from those ports is restricted 1. By the capacity of the ports in the matter of loading berths;2. By the fact that the railways serving the ports can only deliver a limitedquantity ; and 3. By the amount of tonnage which can be procured.In fact, the amount procurable from this source is no more than 9,000 standards a month, so that, even if the requirements in this country be disregarded, 9,000 standards have to be obtained from Scandinavia or the United States. The balance is actually being obtained in Scandinavia.Home requirements are being met for the time from stocks in this country, but they cannot be drawn upon to any extent without leading to importation (which can only be from Scandinavia).If importation by private buyers-were entirely prohibited (as has been suggested), and direct-importation by the Office of Works restricted to the requirements for France, the existing stocks at the present rate of consumption (90 per cent, of which is estimated now to be for Government requirements) would not suffice for more than six or eight months, and there would then be only the timber produced in this country to rely upon.5. Box Shooks.The box shooks bought by the Office of Works are required for ammunition boxes andfbr petrol and rum boxes, and are obtainable from Canada and Scandinavia only. The demands amount to about 1,500 standards a month.Canada&apos;s maximum production in the time allowed, amounting to about 650 standards a month (chiefly for ammunition boxes, which are the more expensive), is being taken, so that it is necessary to obtain the balance of 850 btandards a month from Scandinavia. The relative values are 29,500Z. (f.o.b.) from Canada and 27,500/. (c.i.f.) from Scandinavia.A suggestion that the manufacture of such boxes in this country might be increased would mean, even if labour and mills were available, that deals of the best quality would have to be imported for the purpose, and they can only be obtained from Canada, Scandinavia, and the White Sea (when open).FEINTED AT THE FORSISJT OFFICE BT C.
