Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1917.SECRET. G.-132.ALLIED CONFERENCE AT PETROGRAD,, JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1917.Report by. Lieutenant-General Sir H.&apos; H. Wilson.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-130 and G.-131.)1. THE Plenary Meeting at its first sitting appointed four Sub-Committees to deal with the following subjects : (a.) Political situation.(6.) Strategical situation,(c.) Munitions situation.(d.) Financial situation.2. Each of these Sub-Committees drew up reports which were adopted by the Plenary Meeting with slight alterations except the report of the Munitions Sub-Committee. In the case of this Sub-Committee the Plenary Meeting made some changes, and, while passing all those paragraphs which spoke of the gift of materiel of all sorts, they cut out all those paragraphs (9-13) which suggested certain arrange-ments being made and certain machinery being set up, which would ensure the materiel arriving with some degree of punctuality at its destination.These latter paragraphs were, however, inserted in the Protocol as &quot; considerations,&quot; and, as M. Belayef repeatedly assured us that he would have all these &quot; considerations&quot; carried out, there is no reason to suppose that the proposals they contain will not be loyally accepted and carried out in substance, if not in every detail.3. The reports of the Sub-Committees in the Protocol itself cover all the ground over which we worked, and there is, therefore, no necessity for me to elaborate what has already been said in these documents, but I submit a short report on matters not dealt with in the more formal documents, and I propose to divide my report under the following sub-heads :-(1.) Impressions.(2.) Conduct of the war.(3.) The military attached duties(4.) General Poole&apos;s duties.(5.) Questions of rank and pay.(1.) Impressions.4. In 1915 the Russian Army suffered a series of defeats, a loss of territory, a punishment in killed, wounded, and prisoners, a loss of guns rifles, ammunition and materiel, and underwent a fatigue and a temporary loss of morale which in my opinion would have completely &quot; knocked out &quot; the armies of any other of the Allies. That the Russian Army, with of course the assistance of their Allies, has been able to hold together after these appalling experiences, and not only hold together, but re-make, re-arm, and re-establish itself as a fine fighting machine, better in every respect than it was at the beginning of the war, is a feat of which it can be justly proud, and, indeed, is an answer to many of the pessimistic and adverse criticisms which are constantly being made against the Russia of to-day; and I think it is well to bear in mind what Russia has done when trying to gauge what she can, and will, do in the face of difficulties which to Western eyes may well seem almost insurmountable.5, Russia&apos;s loyalty, and reckless. sacrifice of life for her Allies has been proved over and over again, notably in 1914 in the north (East Prussia), and in 1916 (Brussilof) in the south, and the same loyalty, if not quite the same sacrifice of life, may be counted on for the future of the war.
6. The great difficulty, indeed the great danger, in Russia at the present time is the deplorable condition of the railways. The chaos now reigning touches every phase of Russian life military, civil, economical, financial, and internal. Coal cannot be carried from the pit-mouths to the railways and the manufactories ; food cannot be distributed to the towns nor collected from the countryside; troops and materiel cannot be carried from one place to another and so each &quot;impossibility&quot; reacts on other &quot; possibles &quot; until a position has been reached which, if not quickly and thoroughly taken in hand, may affect the war in a disastrous manner. It is good to know that the authorities are fully alive to the state of affairs, and everything which it was possible for the mission to do to heJp was done. The intense cold and exceptional snowfall of this winter have increased the difficulties, but I am confident the Russians will solve their difficulties just as they solved those much greater difficulties to which I have already referred in paragraph 4.7. During my visit I met many officers of every rank, in Petrograd, in Moscow, and along the front, and, on the whole, I was well pleased with what I saw.I found serious soldiers, men of character, resolution, and knowledge, who compare not unfavourably with their equals on our Western front. The Staff officers seem to know their work, and the duties are carried out in much the same manner as with us.It is true that no commander along the front has anything approaching our knowledge of siege warfare, but it is equally true that the siege warfare on the Russian front is very different from that on ours, and it is also the fact that the Russians have much more experience of open warfare than we have.On the whole, therefore, I came to the conclusion that the Generals and Staffs that I saw were quite capable of handling any number of guns and aeroplanes that we can give them, and if they don&apos;t get the value out of these that we should with our present knowledge, they will get as much out of them as we did a year ago.8. The Russian Army is being reorganised, and divisions are being reduced from sixteen to twelve battalions, and cavalry regiments from six to four squadrons. This reorganisation should be completed by April-May of this year, and I saw several corps on the front which already fulfil the new conditions. Colonel Knox&apos;s despatch Y 2 of the 20th February, 1917, gives all the details, and I only add here that, in my opinion, this reorganisation will be a great improvement, even though, for many months to come, some forty to fifty divisions will have very little, if any, artillery.9. The question of command-effective, active command in the Russian Army is a difficult one. The distances are so great, the climate (snow and mud) for two-thirds of the year so bad, the means of communication by rail and road so indifferent, the Russian temperament -of late to bed and late to rise so peculiar that as a matter of fact the superior Generals and their staffs see very little, much too little, of the troops and trenches, and, therefore, on the whole, the superior command is not well-informed about matters at the front, and those at the front feel that they are cut off from those who wield the power further back. This is bad, but it will not be altered in this campaign.10. The men are wonderful. For the most part big, powerful, cheery children, and wonderfully brave and patient. On the other hand, they are illiterate and stupid, and quite devoid of enterprise and initiative. They are well clothed (except on Eoumanian front), well booted, well fed, and well cared for the standard being Russian not English. The Russian private is more punctilious in saluting than the private of any army I have seen in this war.11. All the horses that I saw were in splendid condition, and this in spite of an exceptionally severe winter.Sleigh transport in capital order and with good march discipline. I was much struck by the turn-out of the horses everywhere. The Russians must be admirable horse masters.12. So far as I could see and hear, I should think the moral of the Russian Army is good, and the officers and men are less depressed by their lack of guns, of ammunition, and of aeroplanes than any other army of the Alliance in a similar situation.(2.) The Conduct of the War.1. If the present railway difficulties are satisfactorily overcome, and I think they will be, and if no deadly internal upheavals take place, and I don&apos;t think there will be during the war, the plans for this year seem to be somewhat as follows: 
2 No great massing of forces for an overwhelming attack will be made for the following reasons: (a.) The difficulty of superior command and superior direction, already referred to under &quot; Impressions,&quot; paragraph 9.(b.) There is no one portion of the line from Riga to Galatz which is sufficiently well served by railways, roads, or waterways to enable a force of (say) 100 divisions to be massed, fed, and ammunitioned,(c.) To endeavour to mass all available troops at one point would take so long (say three or tour months) that no surprise would be possible, and, in addition, immense stretches of line would be so weakened and for so long a time, that the enemy, whose power of rapid movement is infinitely greater, could concentrate on some ill-guarded portion of the line, and by breaking through could upset all the original plan. And not only so, for just as it would take months to collect up at the point of attack, so it would take months to unravel the troops again and get them back to the threatened area.It seems certain, therefore, that, difficulty in command, the absence of personal touch, the terrible delay in transportation and the immense distances to be traversed, make combined great offensives very difficult, and a single massed offensive impossible.3. If a massed offensive is impossible, and if combined and timed offensives are very difficult, there remain only the local and separate offensives of the different commands, i.e., Russki, Ewart, Brussilof, and Roumania.4. These, then, are what the Russians propose to carry out, but as it is essential that the Russian offensive should follow ours as soon as possible, and as the climatic conditions in the south will permit of operations commencing there at an earlier date than further to the north, it is proposed that Brussilof should lead off, followed by Ewart, and finishing with Russki. But as it is of first importance that these attacks should not be so separated by time as to allow the enemy to defeat each in detail by massing troops drawn from other parts of the line, it is proposed that the last attack of the three should open before the first has come to a standstill, and therefore there will be a moment when all three attacks will be in progress at the same time..General Gourko told me that he estimated the length of time between the first offensive and the last offensive at about three weeks, and as it is necessary, in the nature of this plan, that the first attack should be able to continue Jong enough to overlap the last attack, it is proposed that Brussilof s attack shall be the biggest.5. There remains the Roumanian front.The course of the Roumanian campaign has resulted in the addition of some 500 kilom. to the Russian front, and of this only 24 kilom. are held by Roumanian troops. The Russians are very angry at this additional burden, and are never tired of pointing out that this strain on their resources is borne by them alone; that the Roumanians are useless as soldiers and are for the most part German ; that the whole of Moldavia is one great spy-bed, that the Roumanian civil population and soldiers (what there are left) are a common nuisance, that the Roumanian railways are in chaos, and, in short, that the present situation is intolerable.To add to the difficulties of a very complicated situation, a system of command has been set up which seems to me to be quite unworkable. The King of Roumania has been placed in nominal command of all troops in Roumania, viz., three Russian Armies of forty-four divisions, six Roumnanian divisions, and such Roumanian dep6ts as have been formed in rear. During the campaign in Roumania the King has had, as military adviser, General Berthelot, who again&apos; has been assisted by 300-400 French officers. All these remain, but the King has now been given General Sakharof as Chief of the Staff and Military Adviser; but Sakharof also directly commands the three Russian Armies (9th, 4th, and 6th). We get, therefore, this amazing state of affairs, the King (who is not a soldier) commands the forces in Roumania; his former adviser, General Berthelot, remains with him; his new (Russian) Chief of Staff, Sakharof, advises him also, and in addition he (Sakharof) directly commands fbrtv-fbur out of the ulty divisions under the King&apos;s (nominal) orders. To make the situation complete, the railways in Roumania are under the Roumanians, and partly owing to difference of gauge, partly to incompetent administration, partly to German activities and sympathies, the railway situation is very serious indeed, and competent judges think there will be a famine in four to six weeks from now, and that the Russian troops will starve or have to fall back.lhe outlook on this front is bad, and it is not possible to forecast what will
happen. Captain Neilson, who has just returned from Roumania, says that the 4th Russian Army is 25,000 men short of establishment; that from 25* per cent, to 75 per cent, of the soldiers have no serviceable boots; that in one corps alone there are 3,000 cases of enteric; that the Danube has already begun to rise, and has swept awav the old railway (built in 1877) from Galatz to Bolgrad ; that the River Sereth will soon rise; that the troops are already ill-fed and ill-clothed ; and that it may be necessary to retire the whole line in order to save the armies from destruction. General Berthelot Colonel Sir John Norton-Griffiths, Colonel C. B. Thomson, and many others whom I saw tell much the same story. Generol Berthelot is of opinion that the situation can only be saved by an offensive which shall retake Braila, cross the Danube, and hold the right bank of that river and the northern part of the Dobrudja to a depth of 30 kilom. from the river, and thus enable the army to be fed by the lower reaches of the Danube. General Berthelot thinks that an operation of this description would be possible within the next two months. 1 confess I can see no reason for agreeing with him, and under the conditions of command which now exist it seems to me that the less General Berthelot is in evidence the better it will be for the Roumanians.General Berthelot&apos;s position is a very difficult one, and he knows it. He told me he was going to try and stay on for three months; I much doubt his being allowed to. As regards an offensive against Braila and across the Danube into Northern Dobrudja. I am of opinion from all the information I could gather that such an operation is frankly Out of the question until the railway situation has been greatly improved. To me the question is not whether the Russians can retake Braila and the Northern Dobrudja, but whether they can hold on to their present line, not from pressure or strength of the enemy, but because of the chaos in command and chaos on the railways.6. To sum up the previous paragraphs : (af) No great massed offensive will be attempted..(&amp;.) Each of the three fronts (Northern, Western, and South-Western) will have its own offensive, the South-Western being assisted (possibly) by the 9th Army of the Roumanian front.(c.) Each offensive will be independent of the other, and each will probably start on a different date.7. The following further information is of interest. I gathered from Generals Gourko, Russki, and Ewart, and also from other sources, that if sufficient troops are given to General Russki he will make Wilna his objective ; if sufficient troops are given to General Ewart he will make an attack from about Baronovitchi; and, as regards General Brussilof, the intention appears to be to move the 7th and 8th Armies from about Stanislau and Nadourna towards the west, then wheel south across the mountains whilst the 9th Army attacks from its present line.As regards dates, I much doubt whether Brussilof s attack will take place before the middle of April or the beginning of May (new style), and the other attacks will be correspondingly later (see paragraph 4). These dates are only approximate, as they depend on the weather and on the completion of the reorganisation of the whole Russian Army. General Gourko told me that he hoped to employ a total of &quot; some-thing not much short of 100 divisions&quot; in all these attacks, and he assured me that all heavy guns above 4*5-inch and 48 Line, and all available aeroplanes, are to be given to these main offensives.8. I have written of all these attacks as though they were more or less certain to take place. This is not quite so. The position reached when I left Russia was that Generals Russki, Ewart, and Brussilof&quot; had submitted their plans and proposals to the Stavka and had not yet had final approval. I dont know the cause of this delay, which may have a serious effect on the course of summer campaign, since no preparations can be made by the commands until approval is given for their schemes. It may be that General Gourko, believing that General Alexief wss coming back as Chief of the Staff on the 3rd March, did not feel in a position to tie his successor&apos;s hands. Whatever the reason, there is no doubt of the inconvenience and danger of this delay, as if it is continued it will certainly affect the date on which the attack will commence.9. The only information I could obtain about the Caucasus was that the Grand Duke Nicolas was to be reinforced by four Cavalry Divisions and one Infantry Brigade, and that he would take the offensive as soon as the weather permitted. ^ I do not think Gourko knew much about the Grand Duke&apos;s plans, and so the information he gave me was meagre, and he contented himself with generalities such as the importance of closer co-operation between the Grand Duke and our forces in Mesopotamia and Egypt, &amp;c.
I did all I could to impress him with the fact that a really energetic campaign by the Grand Duke this summer, following on our successes in the Sinai Peninsula and in Mesopotamia, and backed by a well-organised propaganda among the Arab tribes, might well put the Turk completely out of action ; but Gourko was not very enthusiastic, though this matters little, as I imagine he has but little power with the Grand Duke. -10. What chance have the Russians of a real success along their Western front ?It is exceedingly difficultto make a forecast. If our offensive starts, as it may, about a month earlier than the Russians, and if in that month we have real success, I would have great hopes for the Russian offensives. Their problem is not the same as ours. They are faced by a very thin line of Germans (the Austrians are not of much account), with no depth and no great central reserve, and with indifferent means of lateral communication, and with only a moderate number of guns and aeroplanes. A break once made in such a line can be rapidly enlarged and exploited, especially when one remembers the masses of cavalry, with horses in admirable condition, which the Russians possess, and which they are prepared to use if the slightest opening is given to them.Perhaps I can best put my opinion of the chances in this coming campaign in this way. If luck is on their side, they may do really great things ; if luck is against them, they will do very little. The Russians have neither the materiel nor the organisation to force the hand of Fortune.(3.) The Military Attaches Duties.1. I was asked to report on the work and duties as heretofore allotted to the Military Attache, to General Hanbury-Williams, to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Samuel Hoare, and to Colonel C. B. Thomson.2. As regards the first three officers, I have nothing to add to the telegrams I have already sent on this subject, and copies of which I attach (Appendix (A), No. H.W. 5, 5th February; Chief 24223, H.W. 9, 15th -February; Chief 29706, H.W. 14, 21st February).3. The case of Colonel C. B. Thomson is very different and rather complicated.So long as the Roumanian Array was fighting as an army there were no difficulties, but now that the Roumanian Army has disappeared as such, and is only represented by six rather indifferent divisions out of a total of fifty, which now defend what is left of Roumania, the case is quite ditferent.I have already referred to the impossible situation which exists as regards the King of Roumauia&apos;s position.   (See &quot;Impressions/&apos; paragraph 5.)This state of affairs cannot last, and until some new situation arises it is perhaps premature to give advice as to Colonel Thomson. It is well, however, to remember that Thomson is pro-Rouman and quite rightly so and for this reason he is suspect by the Russians, who profoundly dislike the Roumanians, and have a great contempt for them. He finds himself, therefore, in a delicate situation, and if the position of the King is altered, or if the whole Russian-Roumanian line is obliged to fall back behind the Pruth, Thomsons position would become impossible, and he ought to be recalled. For these reasons it seems to me that Knox ought not to lose touch with the three Russian Armies now in Roumania, even though they are, nominally, under the command of the King, and I have told Knox, pending further instructions from you, to treat those armies as though they still lay &quot;in the Russian line. He is to keep Thomson informed of his visits to those armies, and he is to give Thomson all possible information and assistance. Thomson, on his side, is also to keep Knox informed of what goes on at Jassy. This, however, I would like to add : Colonel Thomson himself would like to come away, and if he is kept on in a very difficult and invidious position I think it ought to be made clear to him that his future prospects will not be -adversely affected. This applies also to the officers who are serving under him ; none of their futures should be clouded by the fact that, for political or quasi-military reasons, they are condemned to serve in a lost cause.4. I would like to repeat here what I said in one of my telegrams (H.W. 9, 15th February) attached. - .Colonel Knox holds a unique position in Russia. He has travelled in all parts of European and Asiatic Russia; he is known by, and he knows, almost every officer of distinction in; the Russian Army, and as he was up and down the line in the great retreat of 1915, and went through the hardships of that trying period with the Russians themselves, they look upon him more as one of themselves than as a foreigner.[405] . c
When I was going along the line, two Chiefs of the Staff said the same thing to me  that Knox knows Russia and the Russian Army better than almost any Russian officer. I therefore attach more weight to Knox&apos;s opinion on any manner affecting the Russian Army than I do to the opinion of any other man in Russia.(4.) General Poole&apos;s Duties.1. I have already telegraphed the broad outlines of the work which I hope Poole may be allowed to carry out. (See telegrams H.W. 4, of the 5th February ; H.W. 5, of the ,5th February; Chief 29107, of the 9th February; Chief 24223; H.W. 8, of the 15th February; Chief 29329, of the 12th February; Chief 29582; H.W. 11, of the 18th February; H.W. 12, of the 18th February; and H.W. 15, of the 21st February; Appendix (B).)2. So far as Prussia is concerned, the great difficulty is to find out what she most wants, which of her wants she can supply herself, and which must be met from the outside, and, having sent what is most essential, how to get the material from the ports to its destination, and having got it there, to make sure that full use is made of it.3. The organisation now set up under Poole I attach a copy (Appendix (C)) of instructions I gave to General Poole is a modest attempt to meet these requirements. His office contains, in its staff and in its three subsections, the machinery to deal again in a modest way with the points enumerated in paragraph 2. That is to say, that in subsection 1 he will have a staff which will keep in touch with the munition works in Russia, find out their difficulties and their wants, and keep London informed.The supervision and claims of priority of the transport of material from the forts to their destination are also vested in this subsection, and all the military officers at the ports are under the head of this branch.Subsection 2 will devote its attention to collecting guns and mortars at certain centres (Tsarske, the Polygon, Moscow), and some of the headquarters along the front, where they will be assembled and tested, and where schools will be formed, and as much Russian personnel instructed as the Russian authorities will allow.Subsection 3 is only concerned with aeroplanes. The assembling and testing, the schools which we hope to form for teaching flying, fighting, observing, and wireless will all be done at Moscow. After a certain amount of difficulty the Moscow site was agreed to by the Grand Duke Alexander and by the Yvar Office in Petrograd. We are to be allowed to remain there, in any case, until the 1st June of this year.4. Poole and his immediate staff will make Petrograd their headquarters, but they have permission to visit the Stavka or the front whenever they think fit. Poole is, nominally, attached to the War Minister, thus gaining direct access to this official, and as technical adviser to the Grand Duke Serge he gets access also to the Stavka.5. I am strongly of opinion that we are here setting up as large a staff, and we are proposing to deal with as many subjects, as it is safe to attempt with the Russian authorities in their preseut temper and mood.It will be seen that munitions are only represented in subsection 1, the head of this subsection being a munitions officer, but it was clearly understood that this subsection might, and indeed ought to, grow to quite large proportions if the Russians will allow it. When this takes place, then some readjustment of duties may have to be carried out; but I am quite clear in my own mind that if we tried anything on a larger scale now it would arouse the susceptibilities and the jealousies of the Russians, and then all our work and attempts at assistance would have been in vain.I recommend, therefore, that the arrangements now made be given a chance ; as time goes on and we gain further experience, alterations, and I hope additions, will have to be made to the organisation we are now setting up.(5.) Question of Rank and Pay.I attach proposals re the rank and grading of the officers serving under Colonel Knox and General Poole and Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Sam Hoare (Appendix (D)).I attach also some notes by Colonel Knox (Appendix (E)) and a statement of pay and allowances of officers in Russia, with certain proposals I have added (Appendix (F)).HENRY WILSON, Lieutenant-General.March 3, 1917.
APPENDIX (A).General Sir Henry Wilson to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.-(H.W. 5.) February 5, 1917.Present situation and distribution of duties quite impossible and unworkable. In future General Poole will take over all duties connected,with munitions, and I strongly advise that Knox retain Operations, as hitherto, and be given Intelligence in addition, leaving Secret Service and War Trades to Hoare. Consider no other solution workable. Poole will have headquarters at Petrograd; Hanbury-Williams&apos;s duties-to remain untouched. This redistribution will necessitate the transfer of the following personnel from the British Intelligence Mission to Colonel Knox : Captain Scale, Lieutenant Stevens, Lieutenant Lee (arriving shortly), Sub-Lieutenant Hodson, R.N.V.R., and three typists and coders, two of whom must have thorough knowledge of Russian.Chief of the Imperial General Staff to General Sir Henry Wilson.(24223.) - [Date   (?)   .]Your H.W. 5 of the-6th February. As an alternative suggestion, has it occurred to you that all officers dealing with Military Intelligence should be placed under Knox, who would co-ordinate all their work ? This would involve placing &quot;both Hoare and Benet under Knox, to advise him with regard to Secret Service, War Trade, and Censorship questions. They would correspond direct with the sections concerning their own special subjects, under his general supervision. Knox would, in fact, have to form, with officers at present available in Russia, an Intelligence Mission, divided in a similar fashion to the British Intelligence Directorate here.^ ^ 4^ ^ %r ^Another point which has arisen is that we have repeated requests from the Shafkato the Russian Military Attache here for information that has already been sent to Mission in Petrograd. 1 It is quite evident that there is very serious delay in the information passing through the Russian War Office to the Shafka. But would it not be essential that there should be some Intelligence Officer attached by Knox to Hanbury-Williams for direct exchange of purely military information ? The wires between these officers and the War Office in London to be repeated. Can this be arranged ?General Sir Henry Wilson to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(H.W. 9.) ^ February 15, 1917.Your 24223. Your alternative was considered, but I thought it unworkable for the following reasons: First, it is essential that Knox should remain as &quot;Military Attache. He is the best known and most trusted of all Attaches, and holds a unique position in the Russian Army, and any change in his position would not be understood by the Russians. Secondly, it appears to me that Knox must report on Operations as well as Intelligence, and it is impossible to confine him to the latter. He and his oflicers alone know the fronts, and they alone get direct information. Hanbury-Williams serves^a most useful purpose at Shafka, and, by virtue of his position, deals with subjects of which Knox knows nothing ; but he neither speaks the language nor knows the Commanders or Staffs along the front personally, nor knows the fronts themselves. ^ Consequently, Knox and his officers are the only people who can keep the War Office informed as regards details of the Russian Armies. Thirdly, it would be inadvisable for the Military Attache to touch Secret Service; and, from the point of view of Operations and Intelligence, the subjects of Censorship. (as conducted here), of passports and of War Trade have only a distant interest. For these reasons, and IT W 1 Cannot telegfaph, I am clearly of opinion that the proposals I made in ^ T&apos;m &apos; ,5 are tne oruy practical and workable solutions of a somewhat complicated and difficult state of affairs.
Chief of the Imperial General Staff to General Sir Henry Wilson.(29706.   Cypher.) . [Date   ( f )   .]Since you do not consider it practicable to place officers mentioned under Knox. agree to proposal (see your H.W. 5 of the 6th February). You do not mention question of officers to be attached by Knox to Han bury-Williams. I consider this essential It is the procedure adopted by tbe French, whose identifications are always ahead and fuller than ours. It is also the only (method ?) by which we can ensure information from here reaching the Shafka within reasonable (time ?).   Can you arrange it ?General Sir Henry Wilson to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(H.W. 14.) February 21, 1917.Your 29706.   Hanbury-Williams raises objections to attachment of an office from Knox, which appears to me to be sound, and I think you will find that in future the work will be greatly improved by the changes now being carried out.  I will explain fully on return home, and meanwhile reorganisation of Knox and Hoare offices and duties will be carried out.APPENDIX (B).Copy of Telegram from General Sir Henry Wilson to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.(H.W. 4.   Cypher.) &quot; February 5, 1917.I am leaving General Poole and Lieutenant Notcutt in Russia.   Poole will create an organisation for the more rapid delivery of guns and ammunition, the training o some Russian personnel, the formation of trench mortar and aviation schools, and generally speaking, will assume responsibility for all artillery, aviation, and munition material which we send to Russia.He will also act as expert Artillery Adviser to the Grand Duke Serge, and so fa as he can, he will put Western ideas into the Russian artillery.In order to allow Poole to do this he requires at once the following staff:- One G.S.O. 1, and I suggest Lieutenant-Colonel Finlayson, now in the 1st Corps.One G.S.O. 2.   Suggest Notcutt, now here.One trench mortar officer.   Suggest Captain Hand, now D.T.M.O. in France. Two really good  N.C.O.&apos;s  as  instructors in   2-inch  and  Stokes  trench mortars.One officer to organise despatch of material from the ports to tbe places oiassembly.   Suggest Captain Banting, R.G.A., now in France. One chief I.O.M.   Suggest Major Truscott, now A.O.D., 1st Army. . Two sergeant artificers. One clerk.The Aeroplane School, now at Moscow under Major Valentine, will require th following staff: One officer to train in observation for artillery co-operation.   Suggest MajoHarvey Kelley, now in Trance. One flying instructor.   Suggest Captain btrugwell, now in England. ^ One officer in charge of supplies and M.G. instruction.   Suggest LieutenanSmith, now Canada House. ,One officer wireless expert. One N.C.O.    ,, One N.C.O. M.G. expert. Two clerks. Six fitters. Two riggers.Considering nature of the duties and in view of heavy living expenses, I wi suggest certain temporary ranks and rates of allowances later.
Milner, the Emperor, the Grand Duke Serge, all agree to the main proposals in the telegram. I am confident this scheme is the best we can devise to attain our object in the limited time before the great offensives commence, and that it will more than double the value of the material we are giving to Russia, but its success will in great measure depend on the promptitude with which it is carried out. 0 Poole&apos;s headquarters will be at Petrograd, and be will wire and write direct to you. _:_&quot;_;General Sir Henry Wilson to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(Extract.) ,(H W. 5.)

It you and Headlam will study W.O. telegrams to M. A, for some weeks past, you will see the kind of questions which are constantly arising.[Note.

General Sir Henry Wilson to Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(H.W. 11.) . February 18, 1917.My H.W. 4.   Poole urgently requires as Interpreter Second-Lieutenant GeorgeHill, of 35, Bassett Road, Kensington, who lately received commission, and is now at Aldershot.General Sir Henry Wilson to Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(H.W. 12.) - February 18, 1917.Your wire 29329 only received by me last night in return from my trip.Milner&apos;s telegram of the 9th February to the Prime Minister really answers your question, but I will briefly define Pooles duties again.Poole, who will be separate to the Military Attache and Hanbuiw-Williams, and who will communicate direct with London, will divide his office into the following sub-sections : (I.) Representative of Munitions, with duties as defined broadly in Milners telegram; supervision of arrival of material at ports and transportation by rail. Layton suggests Lieutenant-Colonel Byrne as head of this subsection, and he will have officers at the ports and in Petrograd under him.(2.) Collection and assembly at various centres of guns, ammunition, and mortars, , and instruction and formation of schools.(3.) Aeroplanes and their schools.In addition, Poole will be technical adviser to the Grand Duke Serge, and, so far as the Russian authorities will permit, Poole will follow the fortunes of guns, mortars, and aeroplanes at the front. These are our present arrangements, but on return home it will be necessary to examine into&apos; the working of Harmonius and Callwell, and bring their offices into harmony with Pooles new organisation out here. There will in future be four people to deal with at Shafka and in Petrograd, viz., Hanbury-Williams, Knox, Hoare, Poole.   Each in close touch with, but independent of, the other ....General Sir Henry Wilson to Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(H.W. 15.) February 21, 1917.Headlam remains behind for about three or four weeks to see some parts of the front not yet visited.. Poole will commence to work in accordance with proposals already wired directly I leave.APPENDIX (C).General Poole.1. You will remain in Russia as the head of the new organisation to be called the &quot; Military Equipment Section.&quot;2. You will deal with the following subjects: (a.) * Advising as to the supply and supervising the delivery of munitions of every description, and keep authorities at home posted as to munitions situation in Russia.(b.) Collecting, assembling, and equipping of armaments and aeroplanes sent out by the War Office by the Russian Supply Committee in London.* This is subject to the concurrence of authorities at home.Chief of the Imperial General Staff to General Sir Henry Wilson.(29582.) [Date   (?)   .]Your proposals in H.W. 4 are approved, and officers and others are being collected for despatch as quickly as- possible. Names will be telegraphed Military Attache, Petrograd.
*Munitions and Collecting- and assembling- of Aeroplanes and schools,transportation from       armaments and formation of schools, ports to destination. &apos;* The Ministry of Munitions has been asked to send out an officer as the head of this subsection. 4. You are, unofficially, attached to the War Minister.5. Your headquarters will be at Petrograd, where you will establish a suitable office.6. You will be independent of the Military Attache or the British Mission at Stavka, but you will keep both these offices fully informed.of all matters of interest to them.7. You will deal direct with the G.I.G.S. on all matters of policy, but in matters of detail your subsections will deal direct with their opposite numbers in London.8. The success of the scheme is so much a matter of personal effort on your part, and on that of the officers and n.c.o.&apos;s under you; and the novelty and perplexities of our attempt to set up this organisation in a strange country at this period of the war are so great, that it does not seem either wise or possible to do more than draw up in outline the object aimed at, or the machinery to be set up.These instructions must therefore be acted on only so far as they seem practical or practicable, but you will not make any real change without submitting the proposed alterations to the O.I.G.S.APPENDIX (D).Proposals as to Rank and Pay.The Office of Military Attache :-(1.) Colonel Knox to be  Brigadier-General.    No alteration in pay or allowances.(2.) Lieutenant-Colonel Blair to be G.S.O. 1, and remain Assistant MilitaryAttache&quot;.   No alteration in pav or allowances. (3.) Major Thornhill to be G.S.O. 2. (4.) Captain Scale to be temporary Major and G.S.O. 2.(5.) Clerk A.

E(c) Formation of schools and the training of as much personnel as the Russians will allow.Id.) Technical advice to the Grand Duke Serge.(e) Follow the fortunes of all material you send to the front, and advise the commanders as to the best use and upkeep of the same.3 In order to carry out these duties you will establish an office on the following lines, but you are at liberty to vary these proposals as you gain experience and feel your way.J General Poole.IStaff.
The Office of War Trades : The status of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir S. Hoare under the new arrangements is a matter for discussion between the War &quot;Office and the Foreign Office previous to which I am not in a position to make any recommendations.Captain S. Alley has not now got a living wage, but if my proposal for a flat rate of 20 roubles&apos; allowance is adopted this case will be met.2. Generally speaking the rate of pay and allowances should be higher in Russia than elsewhere, for the following reasons : (1.) Officers sent out to Russia run a serious chance of being forgotten or overlooked, and their military prospects suffering thereby.(2.) The cost, of housing, food, travelling, tips, &amp;c, are far greater in Russia than in France, and expenses in Russia are steadily increasing.3. For these reasons I think that allowances should be granted at, at least, .20 roubles a day a flat rate.4. General Poole and his staff must have good offices in a reasonably central situation.These will be very difficult to obtain and will be expensive, but they are essential to the smooth and efficient working of this new organisation.5. I attach copies of notes by Colonel Knox and General Poole.APPENDIX (E).Temporary Lieutenant-Golonel Blair, D.S.O., D.S.C. (Assistant Military Attache).(Date of first commission, June 26, 1901.)Colonel Blair was given the temporary rank of Major in 1915 to make him senior to Major Campbell, R.A., who was sent out in 1914 by M.I.1.C for Secret Service, and formed the British Mission in the Petrograd War Office.He was gazetted Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in 1.916, when it was expected that he would take my place as Military Attache.Neither of these temporary promotions were, therefore, conferred as rewards, and he has not yet been gazetted a Staff Officer. If Colonel Blair returned to regimental duty now, he would revert to the rank of Captain. Major&quot; Neilson (not a Staff College graduate) was gazetted a General Staff Officer when detailed for duty in Russia at the commencement of the war. It would be interesting to know whether Colonel Blair&apos;s duties will be considered as service on the Staff in the same way that Major Neilsons will be after the war.Colonel Blair is probably the only Staff College graduate still remaining a Captain.Major Thornhill, Indian Army (Assistant Military Attache). (Date of first commission, January LS, 1902.)Major Thornhill came to Petrograd in May 1915 in charge of the Intelligence Mission which was reorganised by him. He was told to put on Staff badges before he left England, but has not yet been gazetted a General Staff Officer.He was appointed Assistant Military Attache when it was decided to hand the Intelligencle Mission over to Sir Samuel Hoare, M.P., on the 16th July, 1916, but his appointment has not appeared in the Gazette, vide Dirmilinfs telegram No. 23922 of the 16th February, 1917, to the Military Attache.Captain Scale, Indian Army (in charge of Military Section of Intelligence Mission).(Date of first commission, May 8, 1901.)Captain Scale was sent out to Russia in August 1916, as it was necessary for Colonel Hoare to have someone with military knowledge in the Mission. ^ He was recommended in France for accelerated promotion.   He was told, like Major Thornhill,
at the War Office to wear Staff badges on coming out, but has not yet been gazetted a G S 0 In the view of the presence in official positions in Russia of officers of less than three years&apos; service, such as Majors Edwards and Hallward, Captain Scale should be given the temporary rank of Major.It should be noted that Lieutenant Notcutt, General Pooles Staff Officer, has been recommended by General Sir Henry Wilson to be appointed G.S.O. 2. This officer has less than three years&apos;service, and if this appointment is made, Colonel Blair should be graded as G.S.O. 1 and Major Thornhill and Captain Scale as G.S.O. 2.APPENDIX (F).Statement of Pay and Allowances of Officers in Russia.Military Attaches Office.Lieutenant-Colonel J.
