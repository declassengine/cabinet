Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET.314G.-113.SUPPLY OF SHELLS AND STEEL TO ITALY : UNSKILLED LABOURFROM ITALY.    -ACCOMPANIED by Mr. Layton, I had an interview on this subject at the Ministry of War on Tuesday morning, the 9th January, with the Under-Secretary Dall&apos; Olio and a number of his officers. Colonel Delme-Radcliffe was also present. Mr. Layton, who seemed to me to have a thorough grasp of the details of this question, which is very complicated, had already been discussing it on preceding days with the Italian experts, who struck me as very competent and businesslike. Between them they had worked out a detailed programme of w hat we could do to assist Italy in this f matter during the coming months. A copy of this programme, which Mr. Layton promised me, ought, I think, to be obtained from him and filed with this note.The two general points which we discussed at this meeting were :-1. Italian purchases in America ;2. The assistance that Italy might give us in the manufacture of steel by L &apos; H supplying labour.  .With regard to the former, I urged very strongly upon the Minister that the Italian Government should not itself make purchases in America, and should, as far as possible, prevent private firms from making purchases. I urged the extreme importance of avoiding competition,, and of concentrating all the Allies&apos; purchases in the hands of one body of buyers. The Italians fully admitted that this was the right course, but said that they had been driven to independent purchases by our failure to supply them with the proportion of steel which we had promised in the autumn of last year. I am afraid that this is true. Dall&apos; Olio did not make a grievance of this, but rather urged it as an excuse for the fact that there was independent Italian buying, especially on the part of private firms, whom, as the Government was unable itself to supply them, he could not prohibit from doing the best for themselves on their own account. He was quite as anxious as we were, however, that there should be only one buying body for all the Allies on the American side, and would continue to work with that object, which, if we were able to carry out the programme now agreed upon, he hoped to be able to achieve.His difficulty was in controlling private firms, as these had better acquaintance with sources of supply, and also greater financial resources, than the Government. A suggestion was thrown out that these Italian firms, which are in the habit of buying in America, should be formed into a syndicate, and should put their information and any offers of material made to them at the disposal of the central buying body, so that there might still be only one purchaser on the part of the Allies.My impression is that the Italian Government are sincerely desirous of working with us in this respect.2. The other point that I urged strongly was that they should help us in the matter of labour. The more labour they could give us, the more likely we were to be able to supply them with steel, as we were very short of labour in the steel works, and, while our plant was sufficient, there was a danger of our being unable to keep it running at full power. Dall&apos; Olio replied that he was afraid. they had no skilled workmen to spare, but that, as far as unskilled labour was concerned, he was most anxious to assist us. There were, however, objections on the part of the Government as a whole, but he thought that, if I could personally represent the matter to BaronNote by Lord Milner.Sonnino, they might be got over. [208-5]
I therefore got the Ambassador to arrange another interview for me with Baron Sonnino, who came to see me at the Embassy late in the afternoon of Tuesday. I put our need of labour, and the point of view that the more labour they gave us the more steel we could give them, as strongly as possible to him, and found him not unfavour-able. As regards skilled workmen, he said he feared the case was hopeless, but no doubt they could do something with regard to unskilled.He asked me what sort of numbers I contemplated. I said we could take an indefinite number, and it was not worth while to talk of anything but considerable numbers. We must talk in thousands, not in hundreds 5,000 was the least that would be much use to us ; we would rather have 10,000. He seemed a little anxious about the conditions, and whether there might not be trouble from our labour unions. I told him that if he agreed in principle, we would send a labour expert to arrange all the details, and that I could give him my personal assurance that we would not bring over one man unless we British Government were satisfied that the pay and conditions of living would be satisfactory, and that the people were sure of being weE treated.   On this he promised his hearty co-operation.I think further steps in the&apos; matter should be taken without delay, while the iron is hot.(Initialled) M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 16, 1917.o
