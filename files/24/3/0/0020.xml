SECRET.42INTERIM REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIAL CHANGES.&apos; I. Disposal of Pacific Islands taken by the Allies from Germany.Terms of 1. THE Committee considered this question in the light of theitefereiace. - or ..&apos;. second paragraph of the letter addressed by the Foreign Office to &quot;-&apos;[ &apos;&quot; the Board of Trade on the 8th August, 1916, which forms part of the terms of their reference. The paragraph stated that &quot; it appears to Lord Grey very necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have a clear idea of what increase of territory is desirable in the interests of the British Empire, and how much of the territory already taken from the enemy by Great Britain and her Allies can be used (a) for surrender to the Allies as their share and (6) for bargaining with Germany in the event of the Allies being unable to impose their own final peace terms upon Germany.&quot;2. The Committee agreed unanimously that the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand would resent any proposal to restore to Germany the islands taken from her in the Pacific and now in British possession, and that, in view of the sacrifices offered by those Dominions in the common cause, it would be desirable and politic to retain the islands permanently in British occupation (see also paragraph 2.8 below). They also recommend that the Japanese should not be disturbed in the possession of those islands which they have occupied. In coming to these conclusions they were influenced by the following general considerations.Germany^ use of 3. The German colonies have, from their acquisition to theher Colonies. beginning of the war, been used mainly as a means of assistingGermany to obtain a dominating position in the politics of theworld.4. The possession of these colonies has given Germany a title to interfere in every local quarrel in almost any part of the world, while her colonial harbours have formed at once bases from which her ships can threaten the commerce of other nations and the excuse to her own people for the large expenditure on her navy.5. The annexation of Kiaochao gave her the means of actively interfering in the relations of China and Japan with the other Powers, and gave them a base from which she could seriously threaten our commerce in the event of war, thus compelling us to keep a much stronger fleet in China than would otherwise have been necessary, and this fleet, on the outbreak of war, proved to be quite inadequate to prevent&apos;the German squadron based on Kiaochao from attacking our commerce, and even with the enormous additions that were made to our fleets in foreign waters and the assistance of the Japanese, it took four months to bring that German squadron to a decisive action.6. The note on the German possessions in the Pacific attached to this report (Appendix (A)) shows which of them are occupied by the British and which by the Japanese, and gives information respecting their relative importance, the number of the inhabitants, harbours, trade, &amp;c. ..
7. If the suggestion of the Committee respecting the disposal of the islands now in British and Japanese possession be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it should have the previous sanction of the Australian&apos; and New.Zealand Governments before being finally adopted for the endorsement of the Allies. In the event of its acceptance, Australia would, it is understood, retain the administra-tion of German New Guinea, and New Zealand that of Samoa; but the exact distribution amongst the British administrations in the Pacific of those German possessions which ^ are in British occupation may, in the opinion of the Committee, be left to the Colonial Office.8. In regard to the islands occupied by the Japanese, the   Islands occupied by Committee were informed that His Majesty^ Government received   the Japanese-in August 1914 categorical assurances from Baron Kato that Japan had no intention of seizing territory such as the German islands in the Pacific, which might cause apprehension in Australia and New Zealand.9. The Japanese Prime Minister made a public pronounce-ment to the same effect. The Japanese Government were, moreover,, informed on the 22nd August that British expeditions were on their way from New Zealand and Australia, the former to occupy Samoa and the latter to seize the Carolines, German New Guinea, and other German possessions in the Pacific.10. A little later, however, Japanese warships were sent to those waters, and acted in co-operation with those of Great Britain in the destruction of enemy bases and ships.11. A Japanese force was landed in the Marshall Islands and an expedition sent to other islands. Some excitement was caused in the United States, and the Japanese Press Bureau issued a statement to the effect that the occupation of Jaluit was purely military and not political.   They proceeded to occupy Yap, Angaur, .;and other German possessions north of the equator.12. Baron Kato expressed the opinion to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that it would be impossible ever to restore any of these islands to Germany, and later on, in October, he made it clear that the Japanese had no intention of evacuating any of those lying north of the equator. The memorandum already referred to, marked &quot; A,&quot; indicates the islands now in Japanese occupation.13. Jn view of the situation thus created, the Committee had to consider whether the possession of these islands by Japan constituted such a menace to Australia, and to British interests; generally, as to make it imperative to hold the Japanese Government to their original undertaking not to annex them, or, if not, what measures, if any, might be. necessary to counteract the inconvenience of their annexation by Japan.14. The Committee, basing their opinion upon the memorandum   Admiralty view of furnished by the Admiralty, which forms Appendix (B) of this   the value of the report, came to the conclusion that the occupation by Japan of the   Mauds, islands north of the equator, even although they would provide the Japanese Government with naval bases and wireless installations 2,000 miles south of Japan, would not seriously affect British interests either by endangering the trade routes or in any other way.
15. It may be mentioned parenthetically that the question of acquiring a harbour and coaling station from the French east -of the Cook Islands will be referred to later on. :16. In the circumstances the Committee consider that it would be unnecessary besides being highly impolitic to insist upon evacuation, in view of the bad effect which such action would inevitably have upon the future relations of the two countries.17. The Committee, whose attention had been directed to the increased danger of Japanese trade competition in the Pacific which the possession of these islands would facilitate, and to the opportunity which the territorial settlement might offer for coming to some agreement with a view of safeguarding British interests, decided, after considering the memorandum put forward by the representatives of the Colonial Office, which is annexed to this report&apos;(Appendix (C)), that it would be preferable to leave the different British Administrations to deal with these questions locally as they have done.in the past. xVustralia and New Zealand have always been strongly opposed to the negotiation of agreements with Japan, and had even refused to adhere to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911.18. In conclusion, the Committee felt that the future relations of Great Britain and Japan would to a large extent depend upon the issue of the war which, if favourable to the Allies, would influence Japan in the direction of maintaining good relations with this country, and would render the chances of friction arising out of the Japanese possession of the islands very remote.19. If, on the other hand, the war resulted unfavourably to the Allies, it was difficult to predict what course Japan might take.Portuguese Timor. 20. The Committee considered the question whether it would bedesirable to acquire by exchange or agreement the Portuguese portion of the island of Timor, which is at present partly in Dutch and partly in Portuguese possession. They were informed by the Admiralty that the information in their possession is insufficient to enable them to form any authoritative opinion as to the comparative value of this territory for the purpose of an exchange. Oil is known to exist there, and if it can be obtained in quantity and prove to be of similar high quality to that obtained in the neighbouring islands of Sumatra and Borneo, the existing British concessions might be extremely valuable, in which case it would be advantageous that the sovereignty should be British. The Admiralty state that the island is not required as a naval base in any sense of the word. --&apos; Dilhi, the seat of government, is the only known harbour in thePortuguese territory ; the anchorage is good, though the area is somewhat restricted.21. The proximity of Timor to Australia renders it a potential menace to the Commonwealth if a foreign Power purchased it from Portugal, while as a Japanese possession it would be dangerous.The Committee suggest that, in any discussion which may take place with Portugal in regard to readjustmentsjof Colonial terri-tories, the importance of providing against the alienation of Timor to any other Power should be considered.22. The Committee were unable to elicit any information as to which nation claims possession of Hunter and Matthew Islands. These islands are of very small area, and possess no harbour. The Committee concur in the view of the naval authorities they can be of no use to us, nor can the fact of their being in the possession of another Power affect us in any way.II. The Proposed Exchange of the New Hebrides for Islands lying between the.Cook Pitcaim Island.New Hebrides. 23. It being part of the duty of the Committee to considerreadjustments of territory with the Allies and the abolition of [1339J b
obsolete treaty rights; they have discussed a proposal: put forward by the representatives of the Colonial Office, whereby Great Britain should surrender to France her interest in the New Hebrides in return Tor a cession by the latter of the French islands lying between the Cook Islands and the Pitcairn Islands.24. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Franco-British condominium for. the joint government of the islands which was established in 1906, has proved a failure. It was hoped that &apos; that arrangement would result in the better protection of the natives, and in the reduction of friction between Great Britain and France, but this hope has been disappointed. The French officials have not co-operated fully with the British officials to ensure its smooth and effective working, this failure being particularly noticeable in regard to offences connected with the sale of arms,&apos; ammunition and liquor to natives and recruitment of native labour. There has been no effective jurisdiction over natives, and the French Administration has failed to enforce the&quot; laws, for the protection of natives as against their own dependants.25. It is felt that, despite the partial improvements arranged with the French Government just before the war but not yet put into operation, it is a matter of urgent importance both for the sake of the good government of the islands, and in order to avoid serious causes of friction with France in the future, to terminate the present arrangement either by the cession of the islands to one party or the other, or by their&apos; division. Division, owing to the great extent of French land claims, which could hardly be settled by the Joint Court under two years, would be a difficult and unsatisfactory solution, and it is very doubtful wdietlier it would be possible to buy the French out on any terms which we could consider.26. Although it is the case that Australia and New Zealand have few material interests in the New Hebrides, where most of the landed and a good deal of trading interests are French, yet public opinion, especially in Australia, is sensitive and considers that the interests of Australasia have been overlooked in the past.27. This was made clear at the Imperial Conference of 1907, and in 1911 the Commonwealth refused to endorse a suggestion&apos; made by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific and sup-ported .by New Zealand and by the Admiralty, for the exchange of British rights in the New Hebrides for Tahiti.28. The Committee would therefore urge that, if the proposal  Necessity of con-to cede British rights in the island be accepted in principle by His  suiting Australia Majesty&apos;s Government, the views of the Commonwealth, and the   and New Zealand. New Zealand Governments should be confidentially  ascertained before it is further proceeded with, the reasons in favour of the proposal being fully explained to them.   If they were favourably disposed, and if the proposal were finally adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government,&quot; the Committee would recommend that direct over-tures should not be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the French, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government should wait until the French Government made known their wishes and came forward with suggestions for a settlement of outstanding questions.; 29. It is unnecessary to say that, if the French Government were aware that His Majesty&apos;s Government desired an arrangement of the nature outlined, they would be unlikely to show anaccommo-dating disposition.30. A note on the New Hebrides and on the French islands which it is desired to obtain in exchange for the relinquishment of British rights there is attached to this report (Appendix (D)).31. The main object which the Committee have in suggesting  The Panama Canal, the acquisition of these islands is the importance which the Admiralty
attach to obtaining a good harbour and coaling station in Oceania, in view of the opening of the Panama Canal.32. Memoranda by the Hydrographer of the Navy (Appen-dices (E) and (F)) shows the relative importance of the four harbours at Manga Reva, Rapa, Papiete (in Tahiti), and Bora Bora.33. The Tahiti group&apos; (Society Islands) are not, self supporting at present; and would, not be. a, remunerative acquisition from a financial point of view. On the other hand, the Admiralty state (Appendix (E)) that they are likely &quot;to become a centre of con-siderableimportahceon the cross-Pacific, trajde,&quot; lying as they do on the route between Australia, New Zealand, and Panama.34. A more prosperous future for these islands may therefore be anticipated, to which the French Government are doubtless fully alive.35. Although on general grounds such an exchange as ie proposed should appeal to the French Government, as it is in ths direction of reconstituting our Empires in those &quot; more homogeneous and more coherent groups&quot; to which M. Delcasse attaches such importance, it may prove difficult to negotiate the full exchange contemplated in this report, for, in the circumstances, it would not appear probable that the French Government would be willing to part with all their harbours in Oceania, as would be the case if they gave us Papiete. (in Tahiti), Manga Reva, and Rapa..36. If it should prove impossible to persuade them to give us all the islands between the Cook Islands and Pitcairn Island, it should be borne in mind that our principal object is to obtain a, good harbour, and that the negotiations need not necessarily be abandoned if we were unable to obtain all our demands.37. The Board of Trade recommend and the Committee agree that, if the New Hebrides be ceded to France, it should be a condition that British trade interests should be safeguarded either by a proviso against discrimination or in some other way, that existing concessions and enterprises be.confirmed, and that British subjects should have equal rights to engage in businesses,.&apos; occupations, or professions and should be treated on a like footing in regard to taxation, both national and local.LOUIS MALLET (Chairman).

APPENDIX (A).Note on the German Possessions in the Pacific.THE &quot; Dentsches Kolonial-Handbuch &quot; for 1908, which is stated on the cover to have been compiled by Professor Dr. Rudolf Fitzner from official sources, gives the following divisions of the German Protectorate of New Guinea: Name of Group.

Samoa (Br.)..	2,588	37,269	14-4The groups marked (Br.) all lie south of the equator and are in British occupation, while Nos. 3, 4, and 5 lie north of the equator and are occupied by the Japanese, with the exception of Nauru, which, although belonging to the Marshall Islands, lies south of the equator and is in British occupation. The phosphate deposits in Nauru are being worked by an English company-.the Pacific Phosphates Company.The Bismarck Archipelago and Kaiser Wilhelm&apos;s Land formed what the Germans called &quot; the old protectorate,&quot; the Alte Schutzgebiet as opposed to the Inselgebiet, which included all the Carolines, Mariana, and Marshall Islands. When war broke out both were under the Central Government at Rabaul.1. The principal islands of the Bismarck Archipelago are New Pommern (New Britain) with the Gazelle Peninsula, principal places, Rabaul (the administrative headquarters of the protectorate of German Newr Guinea, a good harbour, formerly called Simpson Hafen), and Herbertshohe (former capital), New Mecklenburg (New Ireland), New Lauenburg, and new Hanover, and the Admiralty Islands (of which Manus is the largest).Of the German Solomons (those to the south-west are British), the largest and most important is Bougainville.2. Kaiser Wilhelm&apos;s Land, i.e., the mainland of New Guinea and adjacent islands.No census exists of.the native population, but the &quot; Kolonial Atlas,&quot; issued by the Colonial Company in 1914, gives over 300,000. (This estimate is much bigger than that given by Dr. Fitzner, and other estimates are even larger.) Principal ports, Friedrich Wilhelmshafen, Eitape, and Adolphhafen.t The tariff system in force included a lengthy free list, including railway materials, agricultural machinery and implements, fuel, lubricating oils, tubes, telegraph wires, building materials of all kinds, manures, harness makers&apos; goods, fence wires, straps, ropes, hawsers, anchors. Specific duties were levied on tobacco, spirits, wines and beer.   All other goods paid 15 per cent, ad valorem.The statistics of imports for 1912 are the following: German New Guinea (Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon&apos;s Islands, Kaiser  Wilhelm&apos;s Land)       .. .. .. .. .. ..      289,000Germany .. .. .. .. ..       109,000United Kingdom .. .. .. .. ..        n,0O0Australia and South Sea   .. .. .. .. /,        93,000
3. The Carolines were divided into :  (a.) East Carolines. Principal islands, Truk (native population, 13,514) (these and following figures are from Dr. Fitzner) and Ponape (native population, 3,266) ; total population of group, 25,629.(b.) West Carolines and Palau (Pelew). Principal islands, Yap, where there was a wireless station and the German-Dutch cables from German New Guinea, Celebes, Shanghai, and Guam met (population, 6,(541), and Palau (4,074) ; total population of group, 14,860.4. Mariana (or Ladrone) Islands. Principal island, Saipan (population, 2,163); total population, 2,789.   (Guam, the largest island, belongs to the United States.)5. Marshall Islands. Principal islands, Jaluit (white population, 48) and Nauru (white population, 34).Jaluit is the headquarters of the Jaluit Gesellschaft, the principal German trading company north of the line.   Statistics of imports for 1912 are as follows :  East Carolines, Marshall Islands, and Mauru&apos; .. ..        97,000.Germany .. .. .. .. .. .. ..        22,000United Kingdom    ,. .. .. .. .. .. 2,000Australia and South Sea       .. .. .. ..        58,000West Carolines, Pelew, and Mariana Mauds .. .. ..        67,000Germany .. .. .. .. .. .. ..        25,000Australia and South Sea       .. .. .. .. ..        15,0006. German Samoa includes the islands of Upolu, where is Apia, the seat of Government, and Savaii. (Tutuila, with the fine harbour of Pago Pago and other islands of the group, belong to the United States of America.) The import statistics are as follows :  Samoa ,. .. .. .. .. ..       246,000Germany .. .. .. .. .. .. ..        48.000United Kingdom    .. .. .. .. .. ..        23,000Australia and South Sea Islands        .. .. ..      153,000APPENDIX (B).Admiralty Remarks on the Claim of the Japanese to occupy the Islands captured fromthe Germans North of the Equator.IN view of the assistance given by the Japanese in clearing the enemy out of the China Seas and Western Pacific, it is only right that they should receive a fair share of the islands captured.For the maintenance of our position. in the China Seas it is of very great importance to continue our friendly relations with Japan, and that, if possible, the Alliance should be renewed. It is therefore essential to meet her wishes in a friendly spirit. The proposal that she should retain the captured islands north of the Equator seems to be a fair one and one that gives no reasonable ground of complaint to the Australian and New Zealand Governments.The groups of islands which, under these conditions, will come under Japanese control are the Mariana Islands,&apos; Pelew Islands, Caroline Islands, and Marshall Islands. They contain a great number of islands, most of which are atolls, that is, mere coral reefs enclosing lagoons.Only seven of the islands appear to possess harbours which would be suitable as bases, and most of these are small.A brief description of each of these is attached.In view of the isolated positions of these islands it is doubtful if it would be worth while to defend them on a sufficient scale to resist attack by such a force as could.be sent from Australia or Hong Kong, provided we maintained command of the sea, and it is doubtful if&apos; we should consider it worth while to defend any of them if they were in our hands. The only British trade route of any importance that at : 1331)1 &quot; 0
present passes through these islands is that used by the P. and 0. steamers, which go direct from Sydney to Yokohama. In case of war with Japan the trade on this route would necessarily cease. All the trade between Australia and China passes south of New Guinea. It is true that the islands can be used as bases for the supply of submarines about 1,200 miles nearer the trade route between Australia and China than any of the ports previously in their possession, but there are so many islands that, even if they were all nominally in our possession, it is doubtful if we could prevent some of the atolls being used for this purpose without our knowledge.As regards their use as W/T stations, Yap, where the Germans had a high-power station, is the principal one to be considered.The area covered by this station is also covered by one or more of the British high-power stations at Hong Kong, Rabaul, and Nauru, except for a small area south-east of Japan.   The two latter stations were taken from the Germans.Yap is also the landing place of three cables belonging to the German Netherlands Telegraph Company, and so forms a link between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai and between both and Guam, which latter is an important junction of the cables from San Francisco, the Philippines, Japan. &amp;c.Besides Yap, the Japanese have established the following W/T stations on the captured islands : Miles Rauge.Truk      ... .. .. .. ..      700Suipan      .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

It is very doubtful whether that consent could be obtained. Neither Australia nor New Zealand have ever been willing to adhere to the Japanese Treaty of 1911, though in 1915 the Japanese Government specially asked that Australia should adhere, and offered a veryMarshall Islands. Jaluit Island. Latitude 5D 55&apos; north, longitude 1690 40&apos; east. Very imperfectly surveyed.It is difficult to determine, from the information available, the extent of the anchorage, or the advantage it would offer as a base.The defence of the known anchorage appears to present considerable difficulty on account of the apparent lack of good gun positions, and the number of entrances to the lagoon which it would probably be necessary to protect.Pslew Islands.Malakal Harbour. Latitude T 20&apos; north, longitude 134G 30&apos; east.A harbour with very narrow entrance suitable as a submarine base, could be easily defended. The surveys are not sufficiently complete to enable an opinion to be formed of its value as a base for large ships.Mariana Islands. Saipan Island. Latitude 150 11&apos; north, longitude 1450 41/ east.Tanapag Harbour. Imperfectly surveyed. A very narrow entrance, which could probably be improved.Without further information it is impossible to estimate the suitability of this harbour as a submarine base.   Water area is about 2 miles by 1 mile.The entrance could be easily protected, but the harbour itself is open to long-range bombardment over an arc of ISO0, against which it is not easy to defend it.
11292/15. definite pledge to restrict emigration (as in fact they have restricted it for many years past in the case of Canada). The matter was discussed with Mr. Hughes when he was in this country early in this year, but nothing resulted from the discussions.The reluctance of the Australians has been no doubt largely due to their fear of immigration, which, in view of the smooth working of the Japanese control of emigration to Canada, in ay be exaggerated. But their unwillingness to bind themselves by any treaty to which Japan would not fail to appeal on behalf of her own subjects, also finds a justification in Japanese policy.The Japanese treaty gives most-favoured-nation treatment, but whereas in this country and in the Empire generally this means a real equality, it is not so in Japan. In Japan 42852/133. Foreigners cannot own land as private individuals.2. Foreigners cannot acquire shares in the Bank of Japan, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Nippon Yusen Kwaisha. and the various agricultural and industrial banks.3. Foreigners cannot be members or brokers of exchanges.4s. Foreigners cannot become public officials.5. Foreigners cannot become barristers or notaries.6. Foreigners cannot own mines or carry on placer mining.7. Foreigners cannot own Japanese ships or be directors of shipping companies. &apos; 8. Foreigners cannot engage in the coasting trade.9. Foreigners cannot engage in the emigration business either as individuals or shareholders.10. Foreigners who are labourers cannot, without permission of the executive authoritv, work or reside outside the limits of the former foreign settle-ments or mixed residence zones.Besides this, it is pretty clear that, when the Japanese object to competition, the foreign trader will, in fact, find, as Sir Conyngham Greene observed in one case, that42852/13. &quot;such difficulties and obstructions would quickly be encountered as would doom his enterprise&quot; to failure. Quite recently the Japanese put so many obstacles in the way of British trade in the Marshall islands that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. nearly made up their minds to withdraw their steamers from the trade, and the Resident39675/16. Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands assured us that they would withdraw their steamers from the colony.,itself (exclusive of Ocean Island) if certain trading licences for which Japanese had made application were granted. These licences were, in fact, refused, but the incident illustrates the Australian view of the danger of allowing the Japanese to secure any foothold, and it is fairly certain that any agreement with Japan would be regarded by the Australians as a stepping-stone for further demands.This view is strongly supported by the action of Japan in regard to other treaties. What she apparently aims at in every case is recognition of complete equality. Thus she is auxious to negotiate a new treaty with regard to the measurement of ships, though the practical advantages which such a treaty could give are, in fact, already given by an Order in Council of 1885.At present both Australia and the British possessions under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific are unfettered in their dealings with the Japanese. No . differential legislation against Japan exists, but if the Japanese tries to land in Aus-tralia he finds his ignorance of Norwegian or modern Greek a fatal bar to entry. In the Pacific Islands the grant of trading licences is in the hands of imperial officers, whose discretion within the limits of local law, which &quot;can be made or unmade by a telegram from the Colonial Office, is unfettered. While nothing substantial is likelv to be gained in the Pacific Islands north of the Equator by paper concessions by the Japanese, it is submitted that any agreement made by us to do or not to do certain things south of the line would (even if such an agreement could be made, which is doubtful), by increasing the danger of diplomatic pressure from Japan, be more likely to embarrass than to help us.(Initialled) H.

APPENDIX (D).Extract prom a Memorandum by the Colonial Office.II-.-The Pacific.Australian forces have occupied German New Guinea and the adjacent islands of the Bismarck Archipelago. Nauru, just south of the equator, is in British occupation, but the German islands north of the line (Marshalls and Carolines) are in Japanese occupation. In order to satisfy the aspirations of Australia,who has always resented the intrusion of Germany into what she looks on as a British sphere, it is clear that after the war the territory south of the line must become British. Australia would no doubt wish to have also the remaining German islands,, or at least that they should not remain in the possession of Japan, but as it seems impossible to disturb the Japanese she will no doubt acquiesce in their retention by Japan. German Samoa was conquered by forces from New Zealand, and for similar reasons must remain British.The destination of our conquests in the Pacific leaves therefore little room for doubt. Thev are not in anv wav suitable for bargaining with, either with Germany or with our Allies.The real problem in the Pacific concerns the.bargaining which we must undertake with the French. The Condominium in the New Hebrides, which was established in 1906, is a failure, and both on its own account and for the sake of good relations with Prance (with wdiom it must, even with the improvements effected just before the war, he a constant cause of friction), it is urgent to get rid of it by the cession of the islands to one party, or by their division.Division owing to the great extent of French land claims in all the islands w^ould P. 97, be a dihicult and unsatisfactory solution, and it is verv doubtful whether it would be Aus- 228-possible to buy the French out on any terms which wre could consider. In this connection it may be observed that in 1913 when the New Zealand Government proposed that France should cede the New Hebrides in exchange for the Gambia or other territory in Africa, His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to hold out any hope that it would be possible to offer to the French Government any concession, territorial or otherwise, which the French would regard as adequate compensation. It remains, therefore, to consider the cession of the islands to France.Australia and New Zealand have few material interests in the islands, where most of the landed and trading interests are French, but public opinion, especially in Australia is,sensitive, and considers that its claims have been overlooked in the past. This latter point Avas made abundantly clear at the Colonial Conference of: 1907, and in 1911 the Commonwealth refused to endorse a suggestion made by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and supported by New Zealand and by the Admiralty, for the exchange of our rights in the New Hebrides for Tahiti. It is&apos; essential, therefore, that before any negotiations with France on this subject are begun the consent of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments should be obtained to any bargain proposed. Circumstances, however, are changed, and their consent, provided that they are consulted in due time,could probably now be obtained, to a bargain by which other territory in the Pacific would be acquired in exchange for our share in the -New Hebrides.The compensation to be received by us must include the Society Islands (Tahiti, &amp;c.) and the Austral Islands (Rapa), which lie just to the east of the Cook Islands, which are administered by New Zealand ; but we should certainly ask for all the French possessions to the east of the Cook Islands. Indeed, it is doubtful whether, if the French cede Tahiti and P^apa, they will want to retain the rest. There is some reason to suppose both that the French might be willing to cede, and that Australian opinion would accept, and 2\&apos;ew Zealand opinion welcome, this solution. In 190b the French reduced their establishments at Tahiti because the islands were not paying their way, and it was suggested that France-contemplated the Misc. 208, cession of the island (which was subsequently denied). Australia and New Zealand at No. IV. [1339] &apos; D
once took alarm, and New Zealand offered to take over the administration of tlie islands, drawing special attention to the excellent harbour at Raiatea. In 19L3 New-Zealand, replying to the despatch in which His Majesty&apos;s Government informed Ministers of the Conference to be held with the French for revising tlie New Hebrides Convention (in which it had been made clear that no fundamental change in the position of the islands was then possible), asked that if ever the Condominium should be abandoned &quot; the rights of England in the New Hebrides may be exchanged for the Society Islands and the Island of Rapa.&quot; Australia, however, while insisting on the hopelessness of the Condominium, wished His Majesty&apos;s Government to ask the French whether they would consider the question of a transfer of their interests in the New Hebrides to Great Britain, a question which His Majesty&apos;s Government promised to put &quot; on a suitable opportunity&apos;&quot;&apos; which ex hypothesi did not then exist. Australia would no doubt still much prefer, if the question were an open one, that the New Hebrides should come under her administration. New Zealand has also recently suggested informally an exchange of 29956/8. Tahiti and Rapa for some of the captured German African territory on the ground of the need for British coaling stations in the Pacific. It is believed that there would b little loeal opposition to a cession at Tahiti, which before the war did more trade with the British Empire than with France (though it did more with the United States than with either).In conclusion it may be pointed out that the cession of the French Islands lying between, the Cook Islands and Pitcairn islands in exchange for the new Hebrides, which the French have always looked on as an appendage to New Caledonia, is in the 29454/8. direction of reconstituting our Empires in those &quot; more homogeneous and more coherent groups &quot; to which M. Delcasse referred in his note of the 16th June, 1915, about the provisional division of the Camcroons. It is questionable whether this principle has much value for us, but the French seem to attach importance to it.******(Initialled)   H. J. R.H. L.Colonial Office, September 14, 1916.Consular Report for 1914.APPENDIX (E).Rapa and Manga Reva Islands.Memorandum by the Tlydrographer of the Navy.THE importance of Rapa and Manga Beva Islands is now largely accentuated by their position as lying almost on the direct route between Australia and New Zealand and Panama, and it appears probable that the Society Islands, to which they are adjacent, must, in the future, become a centre of considerable importance on the cross-Pacific trade, whether they remain in the possession of the French or eventually become British.A chart on which are set out the great circle tracks from Sydney, New South Wales, to Panama and from Wellington, New Zealand, to Panama, showrs clearly the advantageous situation of the islands in this respect ; the difference in relation to either island is hardly appreciable from a practical navigational point of view.Rapa Island.Ahurei Bay, which is the only harbour of the Island, is a good anchorage with a narrow entrance, which could be improved considerably; the anchorage, although well protected, is, however, of a very limited extent, and the area actually available for heavy draught vessels is only about half a mile long and about two cables wide. The entrance is open to. the eastward and therefore is exposed to the full strength of the south-east trade, which is the prevailing wind during the greater part of the year; this is a grave disadvantage, as it would affect the handling of large vessels in entering
Note. In view of the above memorandum it seems desirable to obtain possession of both islands if possible ; hut if only one can be obtained the choice should fall on Manga Reva,A. K. W.October 28, 1916.The above memorandum should be read in conjunction with a further memorandum by the Hydrographer of the Navy, dated the 27th November, 1916 (Paper No. T.C.-25), and entitled &quot;Harbours in French Possessions in the Eastern Pacific other than Manga Reva and Rapa,&quot; and the Admiralty note thereon.(Initialled) M.

Although nothing is.reported on the subject, it is considered possible that the* marshy low-lying land at the head of Ahueri Bay may render the anchorage somewhat unhealthy.The comparative isolation of Rapa Island is a special feature, but whether this increases its importance or not I am not in a position to remark upon.Manga Reva.Manga Reva is the easternmost group of the Tuamotu or Low Archipelago, and as the islands lving to the eastward of it are all British, its transference to British sovereignty would not cause it to be an isolated British possession, but would further consolidate our interests in this locality. Admiralty Chart No. 1,112 shows the group, of which the island of Manga Reva is by far the largest, being nearly 5 miles in its extreme length; to the eastward of this island is a considerable area where anchorage for a large number of heavy draught vessels could easily be arranged, although the depths are somewhat great; at present no vessel of greater draught than 12 feet can enter, so far as is known, owing to the coral bar situated on its south side. This bar is, however, very narrow at its western end, and could readily be deepened to admit heavy draught vessels, as has recently been done at Papiete, in Tahiti, in which case much greater natural difficulties existed.The anchorage is well protected from sea disturbance by the outlying coral reefs, and the safety of its approach would not be interfered with in any way in this respect.A temporary anchorage for large vessels is recommended inside the outer bar of the north-west passage with good shelter from the south-east trade and sea.The general configuration of the land, i.e., the absence of any land-locked harbours, would appear to render the conditions of climate generally healthy.The state of the existing survey is not at all satisfactory, and a detailed survey of the whole group would be at once necessary if it passed into British possession, hut it is considered that a safe deep-water approach channel to this anchorage from outside would almost certainly be found, and the conditions so far as can be judged are distinctly promising.In conclusion, as regards the comparative merits of these islands with a view to either of them becoming a British possession, it is considered that Manga Reva&apos;s advantages considerably outweigh those of Rapa Island.J.

APPENDIX (F).MEMORANDUM   BY   THE  HYDROGRAPHER  OF   THE  NAVY,   WITH PREFATORY REMARKS BY THE ADMIRALTY.[These Remarks, and the Memorandum which follows, should be read in conjunction with a previous Memorandum by the Eydrographer (Paper No. T.0.-17).]THE Hydrographer has submitted the following Memorandum on the harbours in the rest of the islands in French possession in this part of the Pacific (including Papiete, the principal harbour of Tahiti) in case the French were disposed to part with the whole or any of them.From this Memorandum it would appear that if the -whole group were turned over to Great Britain, Papiete would probably be retained as the principal harbour ; and it is improbable that the French would be willing to surrender Bora Bora to us, while retaining Tahiti themselves, as it would be establishing a rival port in such close proximity to their own.Memorandum on Harbours in French Possession in the Eastern Paoieic other than those in the islands of manga r.eva and rapa.1. Tubuai or Austral Islands.No harbours of any description exist in this group.2. Society Islands.Tahiti (Papiete Harbour).The anchorage available for heavy draught vessels in Papiete Harbour extends approximately over an area of about 1^- miles in length, with a general width of about $ mile, but the best portion is about a mile in length with good holding ground of sand and mud ; the general depths throughout ysltj from 9 to 15 fathoms.The anchorage has excellent protection from the ocean swell, as the barrier reef which forms the seaward side of the harbour has only a very narrow passage through it; it is convenient as an anchorage, but has the disadvantage of being very hot, being situated on the leeward side of the island.The passage leading through the reef into the harbour has recently been dredged to a depth of 30 feet, but it is proposed shortly to increase this very considerably.Owing to the rapid increase in depth at a short distance from the shore of the harbour, the provision of good wharf accommodation would appear to be an easy matter.Papiete is the seat of the Government of all the French possessions in the Eastern Pacific.The chart of Papiete Harbour* and the general chart of Tahiti^ are attached for information.Bora Bora.A very fine natural harbour is situated on the western side of Bora Bora Island, one of the north-western islands of the Society Islands, and distant about 140 miles from Tahiti; this harbour has excellent anchorage of good area with an entrance carrying 33 feet of water ; the holding ground is good, the general depths being from 14 to 17 fathoms ; this harbour is superior to any of those under discussion, being on the whole better even than Papiete in Tahiti ; the island, on the other hand, is much smaller than Tahiti, and is believed to be considerably less fertile.3.

ships are known of among them, although it is possible that anchorages might be found if surveys were carried out; none of. the islands, however, would be suitable for occupation as a permanent base.4. The Marquesas Islands.- The island of Nukuhiva, in the northern part of this group, is the only one possessing anchorages worthy of mention ; these are in Comptroller Bay and Anna Maria Bay on its south side, and Anaho Bay on the northern side,, the largest of these three being that in Comptroller Bay, but none of them are really suitable for permanent purposes, being all more or less open to seaward.5. General Remarks.This summary therefore practically only adds the harbours of Papiete and Bora Bora, in the Society Islands, to those previously considered.If the entire group of the Society Islands, however, should be transferred to Great Britain, there appears little doubt that Papiete would be retained as their principal harbour. It would appear extremely doubtful if any transfer of a portion only of this group is likely to be considered; if this, however, is possible, Bora Bora would provide a valuable harbour.The attached chart cutting, enclosure (A),* shows the Great Circle tracks between Panama and. Sydney, N.S.W., and Wellington, N.Z., via Tahiti, with the distances by those routes compared with the direct Great Circle tracks, from wdiich it will be seen that Tahiti is most advantageously situated in relation to the direct route from Sydney, the difference in distance via Tahiti being only 122 miles ; the difference between the distances by direct route, and that via Tahiti, with reference to Wellington, is greater than in the case of Sydney, being 351 miles, which practically adds one day&apos;s steaming.Enclosure (B)* is a portion of a chart showing all the islands nowr under discussion, with the Great Circle tracks referred to ; this shows clearly an important point which should be considered with reference to the situation of Tahiti and Manga Reva on the route between Panama and Australia and New Zealand, viz., that the approach to Manga Reva from both directions is comparatively clear of dangers, while the route to Tahiti from the eastward passes through the numerous islands of the Low Archipelago ; this therefore means that both in the immediate approach to Tahiti from the eastward, as well as after leaving it when bound for Panama, the dangers of navigation through the Low Archipelago render this route a matter of considerably more difficult navigation than is the case in respect of the route to and from Manga Reva.J.
