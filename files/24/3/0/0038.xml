Printed for the War, Cabinet.   March 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. G.-133.NOTE BY LORD MILNER ON THE PROCEEDINGS  OF THE ALLIED CONFERENCE AT PETROGRAD, JANUARY-;i FEBRUARY 1917.[Previous Papers, Nos. G.-I30, G.-J31, and G.-132.]AT the Allied Conference held in Paris on the 15th and 16th November, 1916, the late Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, dwelt on the desirability of an early conference in Russia between statesmen and generals of the Western Powers, and representatives of the Russian Government and army, in order to secure real co-ordination of plans on the Eastern and Western fronts. The proposal was warmly supported by Mr. Lloyd George, then Secretary of State for War, at the same Conference, and presented by him in the form of a resolution, which, though not adopted in a formal record, was accepted by the Conference as an agreed decision. Political events in France and Great Britain, however, made an immediate mission to Petrograd impossible, but at the Anglo-French Conference held in Downing Street, over which Mr. Lloyd George presided, on the 23rd December last, the 9th January was provisionally settled as the date of the mission&apos;s departure from England, and, though there was a further delay owing to the intervening Rome Conference early in January, the Allied Mission left London on the 19th January and arrived at Petrograd on the morning of the 29th January, travelling by way of Port Romanov and the Murman Railway.The Allied countries taking part in the Conference were represented by France M. Gaston Doumergue, Minister of the Colonies, ex-President of the Council. . M. Paleologue, French Ambassador in Petrograd.

M. Woynowsky-Krieguer, Acting Minister of Ways and Communications.His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Serge, Inspector-General of Artillery.General Gourko, Acting Chief of the Military Staff.Admiral Roussine, Chief of the Naval Staff.M. Sazonof, Russian Ambassador in London.M. Neratof, Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs.Three days were occupied in preliminary formalities, including an official reception of tbe Allied delegates and their Staffs by His Majesty the Emperor at Tsarskoe Seloe, and it was not until the afternoon of the 1st February that the first formal meeting of the Conference took place.. The full record of what occurred at this and subsequent meetings will be found in the copy of the proees-verbaux annexed to this despatch, and all that need be said here is that: 1. It was immediately obvious that no real business could be transacted at the plenary meetings of the Conference, where, including secretaries, some forty-five people were present, of whom twenty-one were delegates.2. A programme of work for the Conference was submitted by the President, M. Pokrovski, under four main heads: Political, military, munitions and material, and financial.3. It was agreed that these four questions should be considered by Committees of those Delegates who were specially qualified to deal with the respective subjects.The results of the deliberations respecting the military conduct of-the war, material and munitions, and finance, will be described in the special reports dealing with those matters. The political questions set forth for discussion in M. Pokrovskfs programme (see Appendix p. 5) were of far less importance as regards the war than the other three subjects, and the conclusions regarding them were little more than academic.The discussion about Greece included an attempt by General Gourko to secure a completely free hand for General Sarrail, which was easily countered by my Italian colleague and myself. The French Ambassador introduced a request of his Government, addressed to the three Allies, to agree to the occupation of Volo and Larissa by Allied troops. It appeared that the Russian and Italian Governments acquiesced in the proposal, but I, while expressing the personal opinion that the conditions accepted by the Greek Government could be held to include such an occupation, refused to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government or to consider the question one that really lay within the competence of the Conference to discuss. I learnt subsequently that liis Majesty&apos;s Government had refused their assent to the French proposal.Two other Greek questions were discussed. One, raised by the Italian Delegate, that of alleviating the pressure of the blockade in proportion as the Greek Government carried out the terms laid down by the Allies. The other, the somewhat delicate one of want of cohesion among the Allied Ministers at Athens, put forward by M. Pokrovski. The decisions taken by the Conference on these two points are recorded in the proces-verbal of the sitting of the 6th February. They embody admirable principles, but their execution depends on factors which are really outside the scope of the Conference, so that they represent little more than a pious and unanimous opinion.It was agreed that the question of utilising the services of those enemy prisoners, who in reality adhere to the Allied cause, should be referred to the sympathetic consideration of the Allied Governments. This decision mainly applies to Italy and Russia ; so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, there are, I
understand, comparatively few Czech, Jugo-Slav, or Polish prisoners in our hands, and we have nowior a long time given every facility for Arabs and Armenians to work against their oppressors.Another resolution, in the form of .a vceu, concerned the Serbian Army. Although mainly a military question, it had been put down for discussion in the political series, and I had no hesitation in adhering to the proposal that the war-worn Serbian Army should be withdrawn from the front so far as possible, and that its ranks should be reinforced by Slav prisoners who were prepared to join.The effect of the announcement of the German &quot; blockade &quot; of the coasts of Great Britain and France on the United States, and the Scandinavian countries&apos; did not become sufficiently clear before the close of the Conference to allow of any useful consideration of the two remaining points suggested by M. Pokrovski for political discussion the possible economic consequences of the attitude of America, and questions regarding the application of the Allied blockade to Scandinavian countries-so that, with the resolutions above referred to, the official &quot; programme of discussion&quot; was exhausted.In the course of our deliberations, however, other points had been raised of considerably more importance than those set down by M. Pokrovski, and I propose to deal with them now as briefly as possible.A summary of the conclusions of the Military Committee (see p. of records of Conference), was read at the Political Conference of the 6th February, at which the Military Delegates were also present. These conclusions were, prudently enough in the interests of secrecy, couched in such extremely vague terms, that almost the only definite fact that emerged was the abandonment of any serious attempts to recover Roumania this year. I therefore raised the point that economic considerations should not be left out of account in* the preparation of strategic plans, and laid stress on the great advantage of denying the rich cornfields of Wallachia to the enemy, and I asked whether this had been taken into considera-tion. General Gourko replied that it had been agreed that each High Command should be entirely free to choose its own point cf attack, and that the question must be settled entirely by considera-tions of strategy. This view, which was supported by General de Castelnau, is no doubt militarily right, but the political and economic consequences of what is clearly the Russian intention, to do nothing on the Roumanian front, may be very serious.General de Castelnau urged with great emphasis that Japan should be asked to help far more actively than she had done hitherto, both in supplying guns and munitions, and more particularly in furnishing troops. The Conference at once accepted M. Doumergue&apos;s distinction between the two demands, that guns and munitions could be asked for as from any other provider of war material, and paid for, but that Japan could only be requested to send troops as an Ally, and that her price for this would be some big political advantage. We felt that a request for troops might be met with a direct refusal, a knowledge of which might diminish the outward solidarity of the Alliance, and encourage the separatist efforts of the enemy. M. Sazonofs earlier efforts to obtain Japanese troops seemed to show, moreover, that such a refusal was almost certain. On the other hand, should Japan agree, subject to conditions, those conditions would probably be so difficult, that the price would be out of all comparison to the direct advantages. M. Pokrovski pointed out the one possible gain in making a demand which we were fairly confident would be refused, namely, that Japan would have weakened her position when the time came to divide the spoils. The general sense of the Conference was however entirely against making the appeal at all, and General de Castelnau admitted the force of the political objections advanced.[373J . B 2
In the course of the discussion respecting Greece, M. Pokrovski proposed the formation of a permanent Allied Committee to ensure unity of allied action in Greece. This proposal was not carried further as regards Greece, but it led to an important discussion on the question of establishing a permanent Council for the higher Conduct of the war, composed in theory of the four heads of the Allied Governments. I am elsewhere dealing fully with this question, which I regarded as the one really important point con-sidered at the Political Conferences, and I need not go further into it here.Finally, I should also record the fact that M. Bratiano, who was in Petrograd when the Allied Mission arrived there, was allowed to attend the sitting of the 6th February,&apos; when the conclusions of the Military Committee were read. M. Bratiano had urged very strongly his claim to be present when questions connected with Rouinania came up for discussion, and, as there were no agenda respecting Roumania before the Conference, it was agreed that he might hear the military decisions in regard to action on the Roumanian front. We took this decision, in spite of the possibly inconvenient precedent caused thereby, in order to save M. Bratiano from the very difficult position in which he would have found himself on his return to Jassy, if he had had to tell his Government that the Allies had shut him out entirely, and he was therefore unable to say what they proposed in regard to Roumania. We felt that it was really desirable, in the present situation, to show the Roumanians that M. Bratiano still had the confidence of the Allies. I would add that M. Bratiano took no part whatever in the discussion -of the meeting, which was the only one at which he was present, and that his name does not appear in the official record.
