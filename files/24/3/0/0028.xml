37NATIONALISATION OF SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Shipping, with Special Reference to the Formation of an Armed State-owned Inter-Imperial Shipping System as an Important Element in the Defence of the Empire.(Previous Paper No. G.-122.)1. THE question of the control of shipping in this country is concerned with: (a.) The best use of British ships in the national interest during the war.(6.) The financial aspect of the shipping trade.(c.) The position of British shipping after the war, and(d.) The defence of the nation and Empire.It has often been urged during the war that shipping should be &quot;nationalised.&quot; Sometimes this expression is used to describe such a method as was employed in the case of the railways, which may be shortly described as the State control of the railway system during the war with guarantee to the proprietors that their profits during the war shall not be less than their profits in 1913. This, of course, is not true nationalisation, but national possession for a limited period during which the proprietors are guaranteed their peace profits. On other occasions the term &quot;nationalisation of shipping &quot; has been used in its full and proper sense as meaning the complete acquisition and control of the British mercantile marine. The purpose of this memorandum is to examine the question&quot; of real nationalisation, having regard to the aspects of the problem which have been stated.Why British Shipping has Prospered.2. When the war broke out shipping was one of our chief industries, and it must be freely conceded that its management by private individuals raised it to great eminence. It should not be forgotten, however, that the shipping industry of the United Kingdom owes its success very largely to the existence of magnificent British coal supplies situate so near to fine ports as to give them a monopoly value. Coal, as was long ago pointed out by Jevons, acts as a magnet to raw materials, which provhfe profitable inward cargoes. The &quot;exportation of British coal, again, provides splendicf outward cargoes for shipowners. Thus British shipping is worked on a peculiarly profitable basis. In 1913 the exports of coal reached 77,000,000 tons. It may be pointed out that under State management the all-important coal factor would continue to operate.   It is a dominating factor which we owe, not to persons, but to nature.Magnitude of the Problem.3. There is often exhibited a tendency to exaggerate unduly the magnitude and difficulties of the problem   As a matter of fact, as the war has brought home to us, th.e number pf ships of considerable size in the British mercantile marine is not very great.   There are some 10,000 ships on British register, but of these only some [244-4] BSECRET. G.-123.Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 191 7.
5,000 are ocean-going. Having regard to ocean-going steam vessels of 1,600 tons gross register and over, we entered upon the war with 3,888 such ships, with a total tonnage of 16,841,000, and this number had been reduced at the end of 1916 to 3,464, with a gross tonnage of 15,300,000. This is the part of our shipping that matters, and we see it to be concerned with fewer than 3,500 units of carrying power.4. The practical management of the mercantile marine is in the hands of a considerable number of owners, the majority being under the control of joint stock companies. In many cases, doubtless, the management of the vessels as commercial units is vested in persons who are both owners and managers. A very large proportion of shipping shares, however, are owned by persons who have no knowledge whatever of the shipping trade. It is probably true, also, that in the majority of cases the divesting of shipping companies of their ownerships would leave intact the organisation of the companies as going concerns, with sufficient managing ability to enable them to carry on. There is little of actual proprietorship connected with the great majority of the persons forming the working personnel of either shipping offices or ships.5. If this is true, what reason is there to apprehend that if the State took possession of British shipping it would be unable to manage what it had acquired ? Can it be soberly argued that the control and use of about 3,500 steamships of importance, plus a number of smaller vessels, would so strain the powers of management after the change of owmership as to bring about collapse, or even considerable inefficiency ?6. Moreover, it is surely unjust to those shipping proprietors who are shipping managers to assume that if the State entered into possession of the ships in the real sense, they would, in resentment, refuse to aid the State. For what are the facts ? Above all other trades the shipping trade has gained by the war. Of the actual gains I will speak presently. Let it suffice to say at this point that they have been and are prodigious. It would be a grave injustice to representative&apos; shipowners to hold that if the State decided to enter into the real possession and actual management of ships, they would refuse their services after making unparalleled and unlooked-for profits during the war. I believe that if the Government decided upon nationalisation they would find amongst leading shipowners who are also ship managers far more than enough men of public spirit and capacity ready to do their plain duty to the State. Indeed it is well known that not a few of the most prominent shipowners have, during the war, served the public interest with the greatest ability and devotion.7. It is sometimes said that a large part of the practical business of shipping is conducted outside the United Kingdom, and that this makes nationalisation difficult. The answer to this argument is that when the State took possession of the shipping trade the foreign agencies of the shipowners would naturally come into its possession intact, and that the personnel and connections could and would be maintained.Concent7&apos;ation in Shipowning.8. It is to be observed in this connection that the tendency of recent years in shipping, as in other trades, has been to concentrate power in fewer and fewer hands. Indeed, combination as to prices in the shipping trade preceded its development in many other trades, and has been for a long period a cause of bitter complaint on the part of British traders. Agitations as to shipping &quot;rings&quot; or &quot;conferences&quot; have been so numerous as to become a commonplace. Within the shipping trade itself there has been great antagonism as between &quot;tramps&quot; and &quot;liners,&quot; tramp owners not unnaturally taking up the same position as shippers with regard to ring freight charges and rebates. It must be conceded that competition between shipowners conveying goods between port (A) and port (B) is inherently uneconomical, and that is the proper economic defence of the &quot; conference&quot; or &quot; ring.&quot; Against this has to be put the important consideration that the economic advantages of combination in such a case may be, and sometimes undoubtedly are, offset by the abuse of the power of monopoly when entrusted to private hands. Even in time of war the system of conference rates is continued. It may be pointed out that the chief recommendation of the majority report of the Royal Commission on Shipping Rings, which reported in 1909 was that the best way to deal with shipping rings was that &quot;shippers and merchants in a given trade should form themselves into associations so that they might be able to present a united front to the conference when any controversy arose.&quot; That is to say, the shipping ring was to be fought by a merchants&apos; ring.   This proposal may
appear, and indeed is, sufficiently humourous, but it is difficult to know how, short of a real and effective control of shipping by the State, the&apos;injurious effects of private monopoly in the shipping trade can be prevented.9. It is obvious that very great economies in personnel would result from nationalisation. The great complication which now exists of shipping offices, clerks, agents, brokers, &amp;c, would be swept away. At each United Kingdom port a single shipping office would suffice for the work to be done. It is not suggested that that -could be effected during the war. For the present the multiplicity of shipping offices and agents would have to be continued, and when peace comes very great savings could be readily effected.Shipowners&apos; Profits.10. Let us next pass to the question of finance. As to shipping profits, it has been recently calculated by Mr. J. A. Salter (not for the purposes of this memorandum, but in another connection) that in the first twenty-six months of the war shipping profits were: Class of Ship.	Number.	Net Profit Insurance at pre-war Values.	Net Profit Insurance at full Values.Ocean tramps .. Cargo liners Passenger liners, coasters, &amp;c.* ..	1,666 1,108	  135,000,000 103,000,000 67,000,000	  116,000,000 89,000,000 57,000,000		305,000,000	262,000,000* Taken at half profit made by tramps, &amp;c.At the date of this writing the net profits of British shipowners during the war, after allowing for insurance upon inflated ship values, are well over 300,000,000L Mr. Salter&apos;s calculations have been confirmed by Dr. Stamp, of the Inland Revenue, working on independent lines&apos;. Those extraordinary figures are quite unrealised by the public at large, and there is no doubt whatever that when they are known there will be a considerable exacerbation of the public feeling which already exists on the subject of shipping profits.. 11&apos;. The excess profits duty has failed to prevent the making of undue profits by the shipowners. This is not to reflect upon shipowners as a class of traders, but merely to state a fact. It is a statement which is true of some members of other trades, but in no trade as a whole has the excess profits duty worked so disadvan-tageously to the national interest as in the case of shipping. The explanation is twofold : (a.) In the first place, the two years immediately preceding the war were years of unusual prosperity for shipowners. Whereas in the years 1904-14 the average profit on! cargo ships did not exceed 5 per cent., in 1912 it was 26 per cent, and in 1913 18 per cent. Thus the shipowners standard for the purposes of the excess profits duty is exceptional, and it means that he gets 20 per cent, profit before the State takes a penny in excess profits duty.      *(6.) The exceptional and increasing calls upon shipping and the continuous decrease in ships available, have combined to raise freights to amazing and unprecedented levels.12. The last-named consideration has been partly mitigated by the requisitioning of an increasing proportion of tonnage at what are called &quot; Blue Book rates &quot; (i.e., rates arranged by the Admiralty Transport Arbitration Board). But even on this head it has to be observed that the existing tramp Blue Book rates give a net profit of about 12 per cent, after allowing for insurance on the inflated ship value, whereas if the war had not occurred the profit would probably not have reached 5 per cent. If we have regard to the value of the ships before the war, which is the true test, then the Blue Book rates give a profit of over 30 per cent.
13. In view of these considerations it is certainly not enough to suggest that the-&quot;way to deal with shipping profits now is to raise the levy of the excess profits duty. Even if it were raised^ to 100 per cent., the shipowners would be left with 20 per cent, profit on pre-war capital as compared with only 5 per cent, made by them in the average of the eleven years before the war. It should further be remembered that when the war broke out shipowners were certainly in for a time of severe depression. As was said by a leading shipowner, Sir Walter Runciman, in December 1913 : &quot;We are in for a very bad depression .... there is a very serious position to face.&quot; It is probable that if the war had not occurred, shipowners&apos; profits between July 1914 and the present time would not have reached 4 per cent.14. Unfortunately, too, shipowners&apos; profits have cost the nation far more than the sum taken by the shipowners. High freights, of course, have operated in exactly the-same way as. high import duties to raise the prices of home produce. Therefore, shipowners&apos; high profits have led to farmers&apos; high profits, and the lack of control of freight rates has affected the whole agricultural position most adversely, and inter alia compelled the War Office to commandeer British wool at a high price, that high price appearing to the farmer to be an injustice. Many other curious consequences have followed upon high freights, and it is probable that the private ownership of shipping during the war has cost the public hundreds of millions of pounds more than has been drawn by shipowners.15. But not only is it true that the shipowners have escaped lightly under the Excess Profits Duty. In another respect they have escaped taxation altogether. High freights have meant a great rise in ship values. Ships which were before the war 61. a ton are now (January 1917) worth about 301. a ton. The appreciation in the capital value of British ships has been well over 300,000,000Z., and in respect of this great sum not one penny of taxation has been paid. In some cases shipowners have sold out of the shipping trade altogether and made great untaxed fortunes.16. The profits referred to have been swollen by the Government backing of war risks insurance. At the 31st December, 1916, the Government War Risks Insurance scheme stood thus :  (a.) Premiums paid by shipowners       .. .. .. ..       14,100,000(b.) Losses .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       16,900,000(c.) Balance debit    .. .. .. .. .. ..        2,800,000(d.) Paid by the State, 80 per cent, of 2,800.000Z. .. ..        2,240,00017. It has been urged in some quarters that the proper way to deal with ship-owners&apos; profits is to leave them, or a large part of them, in shipowners&apos; hands, on the understanding that they are earmarked for the building of new tonnage to maintain our mercantile supremacy. This suggestion amounts to a proposal that shipowners shall remain in possession of their profits, but that they shall turn those profits into capital. It does not seem to me that the public can be expected to be content with such a project if it is agreed, as it must be agreed, that the profits made are undue profits. Howr can it be suggested that it is fair that shipowners should in effect have capital freely supplied to them out of the needs of a people engaged in a devastating war ? Why, for example, should a manufacturer engaged in a splendid and useful home trade, which has been half rained by the war, furnish out of his diminished income new capital to the shipowner ? Why should an architect, robbed of his entire business for several years and reduced to seeking some clerical or other employment to keep him going, furnish out of his small earnings, through prices inflated by high freights forced subscription to building a new ship for one who has had the good fortune to make money out of the very circumstances which have wrecked the architect ? It seems to me that the more this proposal is examined the more it will be seen to be utterly inequitable.Security Incompatible with Private Ownership.18. As to the future of the British mercantile marine, the new conditions of naval and aerial warfare must be gravelv considered in their relation to the safety of the United Kingdom and the preservation of the British Empire. The conditions of sea p^ower are changing before our eyes. In submarine warfare- the attack appears to be stronger than the defence, although we have certainly not reached the limits of submarine development in point of- size, speed, or armament. The development, of aerial warfare will probably be even more inimical to the safety of merchant ships in war.   Thus the position of an island largely dependent upon sea-borne supplies is
rapidly changing from one of exceptional security to one of exceptional insecurity. Although we started this war with the possession of more than one-half of the effective ocean tonnage of the whole world, we are in a state of great anxiety as to the safety of our imports. The sea connections of the Empire are threatened, and in twenty years&apos; time the conditions of naval warfare may be such as to mean that the outbreak of a great war would mean the resolving of the British Empire into isolated^ factors unable to help each other. It is true that we have good hopes of increasing our agricultural production, but as is too often overlooked, we want food for our factories as well as food for our people, and nothing we can do can alter the fact that for by far the greater part of our raw materials we are, and must be, dependent upon sea-borne supplies.19. It is surely for consideration whether in these new: and menacing conditions we can leave the mercantile marine in private hands. The responsibility of main-taining it in efficiency and sufficient strength must rest with the Government. If, then, the British mercantile marine is to remain a private venture, it must be brought under a considerable measure of State control. Conditions as to speed, arming, nationality, and number of officers and crews, construction, and possibly submersibility, would have to be imposed conditions which would make the commercial control of merchant ships exceedingly onerous and difficult. Indeed, it is suggested here that the degree of control necessary would be so great that it would be far better to take complete charge and run merchant ships on behalf of the nation.20. It is very necessary to refer to the manning of the British mercantile marine as it existed at the outbreak of war. For a number of reasons the profession of seaman is not a very popular one. In spite of the enormous growth in the British mercantile marine the number of British white persons employed in 1912 was just under 209,000, whereas it was over 183,000 as long ago as 1872. In the same time the number of foreign white persons employed had risen from, about 20,000 to nearly 31,000, while the number of Lascars and Asiatics had risen from a number which cannot be stated, but which was comparatively small, to 47,000. In 1886, when the first record of Lascars and Asiatics was made, the number was 16,673. These figures are not consistent with the greatest degree of safety for the mercantile marine in time of war. It would appear that in the new conditions of sea warfare which we have to face it would be quite necessary for the Government to determine that the white men employed should be exclusively British, and that the number of Lascars and Asiatics should be reduced. It should also be noted that it will probably be necessary in future to exercise and train ships&apos; crews in gunnery and in other duties which will devolve upon them when war comes. Obviously we can never hope again to start on a great war by clearing the oceans of enemy ships as we did in 1914. That is to say, the outbreak of war with a great Power would place large parts of the British mercantile marine at the disposal of the enemy if it were incapable of defending itself. It is difficult to see how such conditions are compatible with the ownership of British merchant ships in large and small groups by private owners, some of them joint stock companies and some of them private firms.State Revenue from Shipping.21. After the war the nation will be in need of a greatly enlarged revenue, and it has become apparent that the State should no longer depend solely, as it has done in the past, upon revenue derived from taxation. We have suffered not a little through this dependence. Germany, by reason of the splendid revenues of her various States, &quot;has been able to maintain herself at a much higher status as a world Power than if she had depended upon such revenues as she could derive from taxation. The British mercantile marine affords, in the existing circumstances, an opportunity for the acquisition of great revenue after the war, either by shipping shareholders or by the nation. Which is it to be ? The close of the war will find the world&apos;s civilisations depleted of stocks of essential materials, and there will be a great call upon the world&apos;s tonnage. Freights, although relatively small as compared with the extraordinary figures during the war, will remain high as compared with pre-war figures. The world&apos;s shipyards will be exceedingly busy in an attempt to meet the demand for new tonnage to atone for the ravages of the war. Ships, although not worth so much as now, will remain at high -values as compared with the pre-war position. In these circumstances, it is suggested that for the British Government to take possession of the British mercantile marine now would be to reap a splendid harvest after the war. [244-4] C
and to obtain the means of liquidating a large proportion of the additional charges arising out of the war., 22. Bearing in mind that the shipowners have paid not one penny in taxation upon . the appreciation in market value of their property, it is suggested that it would be equitable for the State to enter into possession of the British Mercantile Marine at a figure based upon the market value of the shipping concerns at the 30th June, 1914, plus 20 per cent. This, it will be perceived, is equivalent to leaving in the shipowners&apos; hands a certain proportion of the unearned increment gained through the war. It would be another form of excess profits taxation. It would leave the shipping companies in possession not only of a premium upon their pre-war capital, but of the extraordinary profits in respect of income which have accrued to them after payment of the Excess Profits Duty.   (See paragraph 10.)23. As to any ships now under construction, it may be pointed out that the Government by giving priority to shipbuilding material and labour is in effect giving large sums of money to shipowners. The ships which will be completed during the next six months will be finished under special privileges amounting to a large payment by the nation to the shipowners. The national safety imposes upon the Government the need to push forward the completion of ships, but it is subversive of the public interest that such a course should confer unearned increment upon shipowners. Given a policy of nationalisation, the ships would be taken over from the shipbuilders and added to the national capital.An Armed Inter-Imperial Shipping System.24. It is of the utmost importance and value to the United Kingdom and the Empire that a State-owned Inter-Imperial shipping system should be at once established. In the view of the present writer such a scheme is a vital Imperial interest. It is possible to establish between the ports of the British Empire a mercantile marine which would be, in effect, an integral part of the Imperial Navy. The ships could be constructed to give them the maximum of security in war, and they could be manned by properly trained crews. In this connection it is to be remembered that in 1913, the year before the war broke out, imports into the United Kingdom. from British possessions were worth 191,500,0001., while exports and re-exports from the United Kingdom to British possessions were worth 209,000,000L (There is also, of course, inter-colonial trade.) In the time to come this trade will be doubled or trebled, and, given an Inter-Imperial mercantile marine owned and safeguarded by the Imperial Government, or jointly by the Imperial and Colonial Governments, the sea-connections of this great commerce could be given a degree of security which could not otherwise be obtained.25. The Inter-Imperial merchant marine suggested would consist of vessels ranking both as warships and as merchant ships. It is perfectly true that in a single vessel there cannot be combined a maximum of advantage for both purposes, but, from the point of view of our fighting forces, the armed merchantmen of the Inter-Imperial mercantile fleet would be exceedingly valuable additions to the Navy as a whole, even while they performed economic functions. The technical development of such vessels would, of course, require the most careful consideration, but even at the beginning they could be made incomparably more useful to the national scheme of defence than privately-owned vessels could possibly be. As to State-owned ships trading to foreign ports, there could be no such development unless by mutual arrangement with our present Allies, and in respect of foreign trading the advantage to the nation would be chiefly on the economic side. Under a national shipping system the mercantile marine would thus consist of two categories of ships : (a.) Vessels confined to Inter-Imperial trading, and therefore capable of development as war vessels.(&amp;.) Vessels in the foreign trade. These, although they could not be developed for war as fully as Inter-Imperial ships, could be safeguarded and manned far more effectively than is possible under private ownership. *26. Let us sum up the considerations in favour of real and effective nationalisation : (a.) As to control, the complete possession of the mercantile marine would, it is contended, enable the Ministry of Shipping, aided by expert advice, which
would certainly be available, to use the nation&apos;s ships to the best advantage in the interests of the war. Desirable imports being determined by a thorough examination of the nation :s needs, it would only remain to fetch such imports as were desirable, and to take out our exports. Again, it is pointed out that the number of large carrying units involved is fewer than 3,500, so that the problem, considered as one of magnitude, is not really formidable. The time has gone by when ships could be handled to the best advantage by companies or firms controlling a small group of ships.(6.) As to finance, both now and after the war, the nationalisation of shipping would give to the Government a splendid revenue, which it ought in the national interest to possess. For the present, the ownership of the ships could be used as a means of reasonable war taxation. Freights could be lowered, and yet earn a good dividend on the capital employed.(&amp;.) As to British shipping after the war, the interest of national security, as well as the need for securing an ample State revenue, suggests the advisability of making the British mercantile marine a national service.(Initialled)        L.
