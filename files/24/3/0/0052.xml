Printed for the War Cabinet. . April 1917.SECRET. G 146.POSITION OF MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING.Memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping.(A.) Men employed in Shipyards and Marine Engine Shops (exclusive of Repair Work)- On Admiralty work, approximately 110,000 On merchant work ,, 70,000(B.) Steel Supply. The amount of steel now available for merchant work (including repair work) is ...I. The present rate of merchant output per annum is(Le.) 1,500,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity.)(As against 550,000 tons gross or 825,000 tons dead-weight produced in 1916.)II. With-(i.) The supply of steel increased to 16,000 tonsweekly; and (ii.) The present number of workmen-The rate of merchant output per annum would be(Le., 2,000,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity.)III. With-(i.) The supply of steel increased to 20,000 tons weekly; and(ii.) 17,500 additional workmen experienced in marine work, or22,000 additional workmen not experienced in marine work The rate of merchant output per annum would be(I.e., 2,500,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity.)IV. With-  -(i.) The supply of steel increased to 22,500 tons weekly; and(ii.) 35,000 additional workmen experienced in marine work, or44,000 additional workmen not experienced in marine work-The rate of merchant output per annum would be(Le., 2,800,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity.)Note. It is estimated that up to this point by Working overtime and nightshifts and making a few extensions in several existing works which could easily be carried out in a short space of time the present shipyard and engine shop plant and facilities are sufficient to cope with the increases indicated. Beyond this point greater extensions would be necessary.   (See notes to V.)[539]13,000 tons per week. 1,000,000 tons gross.1,300,000 tons gross.1,600,000 tons gross.1,800,000 tons gross.
V. With-(i.) The supply of steel increased to 32,000 tons weekly; and(ii.) 95,000 additional workmen experienced in marine work, or120,000 additional workmen not experienced in marine work.The rate of merchant output per annum would be approxi-mately ... ... ... ... ...   3,000,000 tons gross.(I.e., 4,750,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity.) Notes to V.(a.) While existing shipyards, if priority were given for the additional plant that would be required and the extensions that are possible, could cope with the increases indicated, the capacity of marine engine and boiler shops for merchant work would need to be increased by something like 50 per cent.In view of the urgent necessity for increase of output, a careful review has been made of the possibilities of obtaining assistance from non-marine engineering shops. Some of these might- make engines, but they could not instal on board ship nor could they complete all the piping and other work which has to be done on board ship and supervised and carried out by expert-marine engineers. In any event, in very few cases has it been found that they could give the necessary assistance on boilers. Extensions would undoubtedly require to be made to the existing marine engine shops, and more especially to boder shops, if the maximum output mentioned above is to be anything like reached.(b.) The forging difficulty is a serious one. For this last-mentioned output forges would require to supply 44,000 tons instead of 26,000 tons of forgings per annum, or an increase of 70 per cent, over their present supply for merchant work. It is well known that already the forges find great difficulty in meeting the requirements of the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and the Shipping Controller.(c.) Very large increases would be required in all sub-contractors&apos; work, such as auxiliary machinery, dynamos, anchors/chains, windlasses, pumps, steering gear, fans, electrical fittings, &amp;c. In this connection considerable assistance could be obtained from sources outside the usual manufacturers.VI General Remarks.1. The foregoing estimates, it will be obsorved, are expressed in terms of annual output. The number of ships completed during the year ending December 1917 depends entirely on how soon the increased supplies of labour and material can be made available.2. Whatever amount of steel it is decided to allot to merchant shipbuilding, it is of the highest importance that its distribution should be carefully regulated and deliveries made in the proper sequence, so that the fullest use may be made of the labour available. Ships have been delayed in construction for one or two months, not only through shortage of steel, but for the lack of proper distribution and delivery of the steel that was ava lable.All the steelworks of the country are at present under the control of the Director of Steel at the Ministry of Munitions.The quantities to be assigned to Admiralty work and merchant work respectively having been decided upon, it should be left to the Director of Steel to allocate same to the steelworks The Admiralty should then be responsible for the distribution and delivery of their own, and the Shipping Controller for the distribution and delivery of bis. At present distribution is entirely in the hands of the Admiralty. If each Department were responsible for their own distribution much of the present difficulty would disappear.3. It will be observed that in indicating the additional workmen required a distinction has been drawn between workmen skilled in marine work and workmen not skided in it. Skilled workmen could be drawn from Admiralty work if the present Admiralty demands could be reduced, or from the army.There are large numbers of workmen in allied trades, e.g., bridge work, steel constructional work, and large building contracting, who, although they have had no
pe0ied at tub FOEEIGN OiTFICK bt C. E. habr1son.-2/5/1917.former experience in shipyards and marine engine shops, could very quickly adapt themselves to the work, being already used to working in steel. Steps would, however, need to be taken to ensure that no objections would be raised by the ship-building and marine engineering trades to the best use being made of any labour already in the works or labour that might be imported. This should be done automatically and without the waste of time and delay to output involved in negotiations between workmen&apos;s representatives and the staffs, whose every minute is required for production.4. Summarising the foregoing remarks, it will be evident that the efforts of ship-builders and marine engineers depend for their success on the co-operation of the Government. In order to carry out proposals HI, IY, and V, it will be necessary for the Government (a.) To regulate properly the supply and distribution of steel and forgings.(&amp;.) To give to merchant shipbuilding a greater proportion of the workmen atpresent engaged in shipyards and marine engine shops, (c.) To withdraw from the army and every available source sufficient men to fullyman the plants.April 26, 1917.
