P^jw^ Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government]^       33Printed for the War Gabinet.   January 1917SECRET.G.-115&quot; *.v 9RESTRICTION OF BREWING.Memorandum by Lord Devonport. (Previous Paper G.-107.)THE amount of beer that can be brewed and is being brewed at the present time under the Output of Beer Restriction Act is 26,000,000 standard barrels, involving the use of about 955,000 tons of barley, 57,000 tons of grits, and 120,000 tons of sugar. This is 85 per cent, of what is known as the 1915 output (the actual period in the Output of Beer Restriction Act runs from the 1st April, 1915, to the 31st March, 1916). It is suggested that the amount be now reduced to 50 per cent, of the 1915 output. This would save or set, free for other purposes about 400,000 tons of barley, 23,000 tons of grits (which are for the mOst part maize), and 50,000 tons of sugar.This proposal rests on the following grounds : 1. It will save the tonnage now used for the sugar and the imported barley and grits, except in so far as any of this continues to be imported for other essential purposes.2. It will make home-grown barley available for mixing with wheat for bread.Barley is particularly valuable for this purpose, because there are nomechanical difficulties in milling it with wheat.   This will save tonnage onimported wheat or other cereals. 3. It will make unquestionably better use of the food value of the barley than isdone in brewing (see extract below from report of the Royal SocietyCommittee).4. It will save labour, internal transport of very bulky goods, and fuel.The procedure for giving effect to this policy has received careful consideration after consultation with representatives of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic), of the Board of Trade, and of the Customs and Excise Department. The following course is suggested : 1. An immediate return should be obtained of all stocks of malt and of barley and other cereals bought for malting purposes, and further malting should be stopped by an Order under the Defence of the Realm Regulation as soon as a sufficient amount of malt has been made to produce the reduced quota of beer that will be permitted. This action must be taken forthwith as the malting season is already far advanced. For this reason alone it is desirable that a decision on the proposals in this Memorandum should be reached at the earliest possible moment.2. The actual restriction on brewing should be imposed by an amendment of the Output Of Beer Restriction Act. This Act limits the maximum barrelage that can be brewed by any brewer to 85 per cent, of the amount brewed by him in 1915, i.e.r enforces a reduction of 15 per cent. The amendment proposed is to substitute as from the 1st April, 1917, 50 per cent, for 15 per cent, as the reduction required. An earlier alteration would lead to a charge of breach of faith, in view of the terms of the existing Act, and, in any case, an alteration taking effect in the middle of a quarter would, in the view of the Customs and Excise Department, be practically impossible to administer.3. Steps should be taken to control the distribution of the reduced output of beer so as to prevent particular districts of licensed houses from having their supplies dispropoftionately curtailed or cut off altogether.
4. In order to prevent the reduced supply of beer leading to an increased con-sumption of spirits, measures may also prove necessary to secure a corresponding control in regard to the distribution and sale of spirits.5. The export of beer, save under licence, should be prohibited. All beer exported represents grain that has previously been imported and on which has been expended labour, coal, and transport facilities. This export trade has considerably increased during the year 1916.The Customs and Excise returns show the export as under :-1 01 o.JL .&apos; A O     . . . * a. .. .*1914 .. 1915 ,.For the ten months of 1916 ending October 31 For the same period of 19151014Estimated total export for 1916, 780,000 standard barrels.Barrels. 655,461 539,269 533,363 614,726 412.192 471,412Drastic restrictions have long been, in force in Germany and are now being made still more drastic. Till November last the breweries of Northern Germany were allowed 35 per cent., and those of Southern Germany 48 per cent, of their pre-war supplies of barley. On the 17th November the northern breweries were reduced to 25 per cent, (out of which 14 per cent, is absorbed for military purposes) ; no change has apparently been made yet in the south. These figures compare with a percentage of 73 per cent, still permitted in the United Kingdom. rThe following cutting from the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; of the 21st December, 1916, appears to show that the recent reduction in Germany is con-nected with the further use of barley to dilute wheaten flour: &quot; In consequence of the shortage of potatoes, the use of dried potato products in bread will be completely stopped in Germany after the 1st January, and barley-flour will be substituted. The necessary barley has been obtained by reducing the brewing ration. The original idea of using rye-flour, obtained by a sharper milling of that grain, has been abandoned, in order not to reduce the available .quantity of rye-bran.&quot;DEVONPORT.Ministry of Food, Grosvenor. House, W., January 5, 1917.Enclosure 1.Statement of Possible Objections and Answers.The proposal will, no doubt, be resisted on the following, amongst other, grounds : 1. That it is an attack on a particular trade and will cause widespread loss for which compensation should be paid. To this it may be answered that the restriction So proposed is practically the same as that proposed in the case of confectionery and aerated waters, where it is contemplated that the use of sugar should be limited to 40 or 45 per cent, of the pre-war use. There is no talk of compensation there. Other trades have been, or are being seriously affected because the country could not afford them in war time. It would indeed be very difficult to justify a reduction of the sugar used in confectionery without making at least an equal reduction of the sugar used in beer. It would be equally difficult to give compensation in one case and not in the other.2. That it, will deprive farmers of a valuable feeding-stuff, viz., brewers&apos; grains. To this it may be answered that if the barley is milled for human consumption, the barley offals (about 40 percent, of the whole grain) will be at least a full equivalent for feeding purposes. If the barley is not all milled for human consumption, the balance will, of course, be directly available for animals, though such a use is open to the criticism that it is not the most economical use of the barley (see next paragraph).Undoubtedly in some districts, notably Dublin, where the c&quot;ows during the winter are largely fed on brewers&apos; grains, there may be a temporary difficulty of transition to a new feeding-stuff, but this can clearly be surmounted by proper prganisation.   In any case,
if the reduction of brewing is not brought into force before the 31st March (as proposed below) little or no difficulty can arise till next winter.3. That beer is a food, preserving a large proportion of the nutritive value of its materials. On this point the conclusion of the Food Committee of the Royal Society, in their report just presented, is of great value : &quot; The beer, together with the bye-products of the brewery, contains between 27 per cent, and 58 per cent, of the energy and less than 27 per cent, of the protein of the original material; whereas if these materials were not brewed, but utilised in the theoretically best possible manner, about 71 per cent, of the energy and 68 per cent, of the protein would be recovered as human food. This very high recovery is possible only if the use of the barley and other materials as food for live-stock is equally prohibited. If, as would otherwise be the case, they were converted into meat, only 15 per cent, of the energy and 17 per cent, of the protein would be realised as human food.&quot;If, therefore, the barley is not kept mainly for human consumption a measure for restricting brewing will undoubtedly be attacked with some force as wasteful of food. If the barley can be used mainly for mixing with wheat flour, the scientific argument is conclusive against brewing.
