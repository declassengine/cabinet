[This 3mmm&amp; Is  he Pfoperfff .of His Britannic M^esty&apos;s Government]THERE is nothing to say about this beyond what T have already reported, but I just wish to place it on record that the Italians are waiting for us to make a move in the matter. All the Ministers I spoke to were anxious for such a Conference, and anxious to have it soon. Baron Sonnino assured me that they were prepared to send either the Minister of Marine, or, if not him, some highly placed and authoritative official. All he wanted was to be informed of the date, and that the French Minister of Marine, or some high official representing him, would be present. It was agreed that the Conference should be in London.The next move in the matter now rests with us.Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET.G.-114.MARITIME CONFERENCE.Note by Lord Milner.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 16, 1917.(Initialled)M.o
