TERRITORIAL CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS.Third Interim Report.I. IN discussing the question of exchanges or adjustments of territory between the British Empire and its Allies at the conclusion of the war, the Committee realise that they are not in a position to frame any c unprehensive or definite scheme. To enable them to do so it would be necessary for them to know on what general principles the territories acquired in the course of the war are to be apportioned between the leading Allies, i.e., whether the guiding principle is to be that of equal division, or division proportionate to the effort and sacrifices involved, or. more roughly, that of actual occupation during the course of the war. It would be equally necessary for them to know what is the base-line from wdiich any calculation is to start, i.e., whether Alsace-Lorraine is to be restored as part of Fvance&apos;s share of the spoils of war, or, as the French apparently contend, treated as a liberated province on the same footing as the other French provinces now in German occupation. Similarly, whether Egypt and Cyprus are to be reckoned as British acquisitions made during the war, or as previously existing British possessions whose value has been somewhat enhanced during the war by the abrogation of certain limitations upon our authority. The most the Committee can do is to set out and, as far as possible, classify certain British and Allied desiderata or claims, and to indicate, tentatively, ways and means of harmonising these in detail.2. In order-to arrive at anything more than the most tentative idea of what exchanges are feasible, it is desirable to form some estimate of the value of the various territories or rights, the exchange of which mav come into consideration, both to their present and would-be possessors. The values to be estimated consist, not only of such calculable things as areas, populations, and economic resources, actual or potential, but to a large extent of such intangible factors as administrative, strategical, diplomatic, or sentimental considerations.British Desiderata from the French.3. The principal British desiderata which it would be advantageous, if possible, to secure from the French are as follows (the grouping is geographical and not in order of importance) :  (l.) French Somaliland.(2.) Abrogation of French treaty rights in Muscat and Zanzibar and French claims in Sheikh Said or elsewhere in Arabia outside of the portion of the &quot; Arab State &quot; defined as in the French sphere of influence in the Anglo-Franco-Russian Agreement of May 1916.(3.) The French possessions in India: (a) as a whole; (6) Chandernagore and the loges, compensating France by an increase in the area of Pondicherry.(4.) Settlement of the New Hebrides question.(5.) Eastern Pacific Islands : (a) as a whole; (b) Manga Reva, or some other islandon the New Zealand-Panama route. (6.) St. Pierre and Miquelon, with the abandonment of French fishery rights onthe Newfoundland Treaty Coast.4. French Somaliland is not a country of great economic value in itself, though there are considerable possibilities in prospect with the development of Jibuti as the terminus of the railway line to Adis Abeba. Its main importance for us lies in the fact that Jibuti, as the seat of the arms traffic, has been the cause of serious trouble to us in India and adjoining countries, as well as in the Sudan, Uganda. British East Aft ica, and British Somaliland, trouble which is likely to be greatly increased when the cessation of the present war throws large quantities of cheap arms into the market. [Vide report of the Arms Traffic Sub-Committee.) By acquiring Jibuti and French [408]
Somaliland we should make much more certain of suppressing this traffic than by any agreement with the French based on their co-operation in suppressing it. The acquisition of French Somaliland has also a further contingent value, as facilitating an arrangement with Italy in fulfilment of article 13 of the Treaty of 1915. Its effect would be to eliminate French interests and influence from Abyssinia and to increase correspondingly British and Italian economic and political interests. Lastly, there is possibly some strategic advantage in holding both sides of the Straits of Bab-ei-Mandeb.5. The economic value of French Somaliland to the French is somewhat higher than to us, in consequence of the lucrative character of the arms traffic. The total imports (excluding specie) of French Somaliland in 1913 amounted to 1,357,0007., of which 319,0001 came from France, 247,000L from the United Kingdom, and 416,000/. from-British possessions. The exports in the same year amounted to 1,90S,000L, of which 333,0001 went to France, 99,0001., to the United Kingdom, and 398.000J. to British possessions. The revenue in recent years has fluctuated between 60,0001. and 1 20,0001. More important still is the fact that it provides the only French coaling station on the way to the East and Madagascar. Upon this fact, and upon the general political and strategic importance of their being established on the Red Sea and at the gateway into Abyssinia, where their influence is defined in the tripartite agreement of the 13th December,. 1906 (see Appendix (A)), the French are certain to put a very high, and possibly a prohibitive, value. In other words, it is possible that France may estimate her interest in retaining French Somaliland at a higher valuation than we are disposed to attach to its acquisition, and, if so, the first condition of a bargain is absent. On the other hand, we regard the British interest-in acquiring the colony as exceedingly strong, and desire to draw attention to the view of the Anns Traffic Committee that, &quot;having regard to the vital interests at stake, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified in making heavy sacrifices to obtain the desired results.&quot;6. The exclusion from the bargain of Obok and the immediately surrounding district has been considered by the Committee. Such an exclusion would enable the French to retain a coaling station, and would not seriously impair the general economic and strategic value of the colony to us. But there is every reason to fear that our main desideratum, the suppression of the arms traffic, would not be secured, and that Obok would simply replace Jibuti as its centre. On the other hand, the French would not retain that which they probably value most the political and other opportunities which are connected with the development of the railway into Abyssinia. On the whole, the Committee are of opinion that a bargain as regards French Somaliland would be rendered valueless, so far as the control of the arms traffic is concerned, by the exclusion of Obok from the exchange.7. The abrogation of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, by which the two Powers undertook reciprocally to respect the independence of the Suitan of Muscat, is recommended as desirable, though not essential, by the Arms Traffic Sub-Committee, in order to put the suppression of the traffic in arms on a permanent basis. Apart, however, from the aums traffic, we are of opinion that it is desirable to eliminate French political interests in Muscat as being inconsistent with our special political and naval position in the Gulf, the maintenance of which, to the exclusion of all other Powers, is in our opinion a matter of vital necessity (see Appendix (B)).Since the acquiescence of the French Government in a stricter regulation of the arms traffic from Muscat in 1912 the trade, has very little actual value for them, but the limitation imposed upon our freedom of action by the agreement of 1862 has a political and exchange value to them which cannot be ignored, although in present circumstances it would be difficult for them to press this consideration.8. The Zanzibar treaties are numerous and complex, but in practice the three which are of chief importance are those of France, the United States, and Germany. That with Germany has presumably lapsed, but we are left with the question of the French and American treaties (as well as with the Portuguese, Italian, Belgian, and Russian treaties, which derive their benefits from the two former under the most-favoured-nation treatment clause).   The most embarrassing clauses are those concerned with:  
(1.) The remnants of the old consular jurisdiction^ which confer  obstructive privileges.(2.) The limitation of the Government of Zanzibar&apos;s powers of taxation, and of theimposition of import or export duties. (3.) The personal inviolability claimed by foreign consuls.Of these rights it may be said roughly that those given under the first heading are derived from the French treaty, while those under headings (2) and (3) are contained in the treaty with the United States. The privileges conferred by these treaties with the abuses deriving from them have, of course, been extended under the most-favoured-nation clause to other Powers interested.9. If we are to secure entire freedom of -ction it must be remembered that negotiations will be necessary with the United States as well as with France, and that, although an agreement with France will be a decided step in the right direction, some of the obstructions will still be perpetuated under the treaty with the United States. The Committee, nevertheless, regard the abrogation of French treaty rights in Zanzibar as desirable, and they suggest that it might be included in any negotiation for territorial exchange with the French, and possibly made one of the conditions of British assent to the permanent occupation of the Cameroons by France.10. The French claim to Sheikh Said, which is situated in a triangular area measuring some 550 square miles, having the sea as its base and immediately adjoining the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, is mainly based on its purchase, from a local sheikh, by some Frenchmen in 1869, although shadowy French claims date back to the 18th century. They have, however., never been recognised by us or the Turks, who gave us an assurance in 1905 that they would never alienate it under any circumstances, an assurance which was confirmed in 1914. It lies within actual gunshot of Perim, which was shelled from it early in the war. Its inclusion in the Aden Protectorate is therefore necessary for the security of the island (see Appendices (B) and(C)).11. The Committee recommend that the Turks, who were allowed to reoccupp it in December 1914, after being turned out by us, should be again ejected, and that the place should be taken over by British forces. Its possession by us at the conclusion of the war would be a strong point in our favour. The action which we recommend might not be agreeable to the French, but they could not reasonably object to the expulsion of the Turkish troops. Moreover, our acquisition of Sheikh Said can be justified under the proviso inserted in article 10 of M. Cambon&apos;s note of the 9th May, 1916, recording the Anglo-French agreement respecting Arabia, under which our general undertaking not to make annexations in Arabia is subject to a right to make such rectifications on the Aden frontier as are necessitated by recent Turkish aggression. One of the reasons for which this proviso was inserted was the necessity under which we might find ourselves of annexing Sheikh Said, although this was not stated to the French. It has been stated already that we have never recognised French claims to Sheikh Said, but this will probably not prevent the French whose claims are exhaustively set forth in a recent German work: by Dr. Stuhlmann, an extract from which is annexed (see Appendix (D)) from protesting against its retention by us, which may possibly necessitate our offering them a quid pro quo.12. The French possessions in India consist of Pondicherry and its dependencies, Karikal, Mahe, and Yanaon on the Madras coast, and Chandernagore on the Hooghly, 20 miles north of Calcutta. The French also claim certain rights of jurisdiction over a number of scattered patches of land, known as the loges, the sites of former French factories. The total area of these possessions is about 200 square miles, with a population of 270,000. Their value to us is purely administrative. At present they are all potential centres of sedition, and Chandernagore in particular is a hotbed of anarchism, where assassination can be plotted, with absolute impunity in close proximity to Calcutta. The advantage of eliminating Chandernagore has, indeed, been described &quot;by the India Office as a matter of vital importance, compared with which the elimination of the rest of the French possessions and loges is a minor matter.. From a military point of view there are objections connected with the possible cable and wireless use of these possessions. On the other hand, their economic value to us is almost a matter of indifference.[408] C
13. To the French nation, as apart from the vested interests of deputies, officials, and others, these possessions have chiefly a sentimental value. But it may reasonably be assumed that the sentimental value attaches to the retention of a French foothold in India, and more particularly perhaps to the name of Pondicherry. The separate value of Chandernagore, and the importance of the-vested interests connected with it, can only be very small.14. The probability of our being able to secure the complete elimination of the French from India by any offer which it is worth our while making is problematical. But there ought to be no real difficulty in securing Chandernagore. Negotiations took place in 1857 for the cession of all French territory, except Pondicherry and Karikal. and in 1883-85 for the extinction of French rights in the loges in return for territorial concessions in the Pondicherry region. These broke down, but in 1910 the Government of India submitted a proposal, never actually placed before the French, for ceding to France a considerable area of land near Pondicherry in exchange for the cession of the other territories and rights. The proposal as outlined (see Appendix (E)) would give France about the same population as before, but with an increase of about 50 square miles of territory, and an administratively much more compact and convenient possession, while we should secure the vital object, namely, the elimination of Chandernagore at a trifling cost. This bargain, indeed, is one which we ought not only to be able to secure, but to have a right to insist upon, in view of all the circumstances of the present war. The Committee,&apos; in fact, regard the cession of Chandernagore, at any rate, as one of such urgency from the point of view of the peace and good government of India, and therefore of the general welfare of the Allied cause, that they recommend that it should be taken up with the French Government at once, and settled as soon as possible, without waiting for the conclusion of the war or for any general territorial settlement.15. The Committee are of opinion that in the course of any general settlement it would be desirable to secure from France an undertaking against the alienation of any part of French Indo-China to a third Power.16. The situation in the Pacific has already been dealt with in the First Interim Report. It was there pointed out that the condominium in the New Hebrides is an admitted failure, and that a partition of the islands would be a difficult and unsatis-factory solution, in view of the extent of the French claims in all the islands. The recommendation made was that the whole of our claims in the New Hebrides should be abandoned to the French in return for the cession to us of the French islands east of the Cook Islands. This would give us, besides a not unreasonable equivalent in economic value, one or more useful coaling stations on the route from New Zealand and Australia to the Panama Canal. As in the case of Pondicherry and Chander-nagore, there would be a considerable convenience, from the point of view both of French and of Australasian sentiment, in an exchange of territory within the same geographical area, though it must be remembered that the proposed arrangement is one which wdll appeal more readily to New Zealand than to Australia which has always resented the presence of the French in the New Hebrides.17. Failing such a bargain it might be possible, if the arrangement were one which commended itself to Australia, to secure, in return for the complete cession of the New IJebrides to France, Manga Reva or another good harbour on the route to Panama, together with other concessions. But, even if in this way it were possible to obtain, say, the cession of St. Pierre and Miquelon, the exchange would remain, as far as the Pacific was concerned, very unequal, and it would, of course, be necessary to obtain the consent of the Commonwealth and New Zealand before proposing it. On the other hand, if there were some desideratum outside the Pacific on which the French set a high value, it is conceivable, though not probable, that they might be prepared to purchase it by the abandonment of the whole of their rights in the New Hebrides as well as the cession of a harbour in the Eastern Pacific Islands.18. The value to France of St. Pierre and Miquelon and of the French fishery rights on the Treaty Coast is now very small, but the nature of the. French rights is such as to be a standing cause&apos; of possible friction between the two countries, and of actual adminis-trative inconvenience to Newfoundland. The islands have a great sentimental value,to Newfoundland, and the elimination of any possibility of their acquisition by the United States is a matter of great importance, not only to Canada and to Newfoundland, but to
the Empire generally. The present is a specially appropriate time for arranging this, such as is very unlikely to recur. Moreover, their acquisition would be the^ only addition of territory which the British North American Dominions would receive as the reward of their sacrifices (see Appendix (F) ).Some Probable French Desiderata from the British.19. The French may very possibly, in the interests of geographical consolidation, put forward very far-reaching proposals which are hardly likely to commend themselves to the British Government. But the following are some of the most probable desiderata which might reasonably be taken into practical consideration : (1.) Recognition of their right to the whole of the territory now occupied by them in the Cameroons, subject to the rectification of the Nigerian frontier.(2.) The acquisition of the whole of Togoland, subject, to the rectification of the Gold Coast frontier.(3.) Rectification of the Darfur frontier.(4.) The Gambia.20. It was pointed out in the Second Interim Report that we should insist upon the provisional nature of the present partition of the Cameroons in order to secure some quid pro quo elsewhere for our eventual acquiescence in its becoming permanent. But that quid pro quo cannot be very large. The French know we are not likely to dispute their claim to remain in possession, beyond securing what we regard as a satisfactory rectification of the Nigerian frontier. The Committee are of opinion that our acquiescence might very reasonably be made dependent on a similar abandonment by France of some claim elsewhere, e.g., Muscat and Zanzibar, or as a make-weight in some larger transaction.21. On the other hand the portion of Togoland which we hold under the provisional arrangement will, even after allowing for the rectification of the Gold Coast frontier, he a substantial portion of the whole colony. Moreover, it includes not only the most fertile area, but also the starting point and initial sections of the whole existing railway system. Its value as a channel of entry into the back country is therefore very considerable to the owners of the latter, and the Committee consider that the French should pay a substantial price for its acquisition.22. The rectification of the western frontier of the Darfur Province so as to include Dar Tama in the French Sudan is a matter to which the French attach importance.It has been recommended by Sir Reginald Wingate, who states that considerable political capital should be made of this concession. He is as yet unable to say whether other concessions of value could be given to the French on that frontier, but he has promised to provide further information on this subject.23. The Gambia is a flourishing colony with a substantial trade (exports in 1913, not including specie, 662,000L ; imports in 1913, 619,000L), and a stable revenue of about 100,0001. a year. It has an area of from 4,000 to 5,000 square miles. It possesses an excellent seaport capable of conversion into a strong naval position, and a waterway Avhich is unique in Africa, since, unlike all other African rivers, the Gambia has neither delta nor bar to obstruct navigation. The river is no less than 27 miles across at the mouth, and l\ miles wide at Bathurst, the capital. It is safe to enter, as there is never less than 27 feet of water, and it is navigable for some 150 miles by steamers drawing 12 feet, and for some 80 miles further by vessels of 10 feet draught. Bathurst is, moreover, an important link in our wireless communications both for naval and commercial signalling, as it is in a good central position; it is near the trade routes, and has cable communications with St. Vincent (Cape Verde Islands) and thence with England and South America. Sierra Leone is not in such a suitable position, and a wireless station there would be considerably screened by the land to the north-west, A large and important area now covered by Bathurst would not be covered by a similar station at Sierra Leone. It must also be borne in mind that &quot;there is a considerable trade between the colony and the United Kingdom and between the colony and other British colonies (exports to the United Kingdom in 1913, 41,000Z. ; imports from the United Kingdom in 1913, 252,000i. ; imports from British colonies, 94,444Z.), most of which would
probably disappear in the case of a transfer, as the French would no doubt desire to bring the new territory under the differential tariff which is at present in force in Senegambia (see Appendix (G) ).24. The importance of Gambia to the French is, however, considerably greater than it is to us. It forms a natural entrance into the whole of Western Senegal, and its acquisition would undoubtedly enhance the value of French West Africa as a whole, as well as be a convenience from the administrative point of view. It would be easy for us, if we chose to encourage a traffic in arms or to close our eyes to smuggling, to make the Gambia a no less serious embarrassment to the French than Jibuti is to us. From the sentimental point of view, too, the French very much dislike this enclave in their West African Empire. Their anxiety to secure it was shown in 1908, but the terms then offered, viz.. abandonment of French rights in Muscat and Zanzibar, were obviously out of the question.25. The Committee consider that if the French raise the question of the Gambia, we should make it clear that we can only cede it for a really substantial equivalent, such as French Somaliland (including, necessarily, the elimination of French treaty rights in Abyssinia), together with French rights in Muscat and Zanzibar. The cession would be subject, of course, to satisfactory arrangements being made for the security of the interests of the various officials and pensioners, the various &apos;missionary and educational establishments, and the interests of the native inhabitants, especially of the chiefs. It would also be very desirable that arrangements should be made for the protection of British trade, but, as indicated above, the French would, no doubt, desire to treat the new territory as part of Senegambia, and to subject it to the same Customs regime.26. In some instances, particularly where the interests to be surrendered are economic rather than sentimental, it is possible that an exchange, which might otherwise be impossible to arrange, might be facilitated by the remission of a portion of France&apos;s indebtedness to us.French and British Desiderata Compared.27. The most convenient way of arriving at a general settlement with France would be to arrange definite pairs of exchanges, wherever possible in the same geographical areas. For example, a settlement might be arrived at on the basis of the following pairs of exchanges : (1.) French cession of Chandernagore and other Indian dependencies,  exceptPondicherry, which would be correspondingly enlarged. (2.) French cession of Eastern Pacific Islands in return for complete cession of theNew Hebrides to France. (3.) British cession of the Gambia in return for French Somaliland (includingthe elimination of French rights in Abyssinia) and abandonment of Frenchtreaty rights in Muscat and Zanzibar. (4.) Abandonment of British claims in the Cameroons (subject to the rectificationof the Nigerian frontier) and the rectification of the Darfur frontier inreturn for the cession of St. Pierre and Miquelon and the abandonmentof the French fishery rights on the treaty shore.We should then still have Togoland in hand as a means of amplifying the above settlement, possibly by the complete elimination of the French from India, or by the acquisition of the New Hebrides.28. But such a settlement by pairs of exchanges may not be possible to arrange. Still less is it possible to lay down such a definite scheme of exchanges beforehand, except as an example, or at most an indication of what might be aimed at. For one thing, it may be difficult to find pairs which are sufficiently equivalent in value. If, for instance, the French declined to cede more than one or two of their Eastern Pacific Islands as againt the New Hebrides, there would be a loss on our side which would require to be made good on some other bargain. Again, in the course of negotiations, a number of alternative suggestions are certain to be put forward, ranging from the smallest adjustments to the most comprehensive territorial rearrangements. In the circumstances the Committee do not feel that they can do more than indicate some of
the main desiderata, and to express the opinion that our negotiators should be equipped with the very fullest and most&quot; carefully worked out data to enable them to conduct their task successfully..-Italian Claims and Desiderata from the Allies.29. By article 13 of the Treat)- under which Italy entered the war (Appendix (H)) it was stipulated that, &quot; in the event of the other Powers increasing their African Colonial.possessions at the expense of Germany, France and Great Britain recognise in principle the claim of Italy to some &apos; equitable compensations,&apos; notably in the settle-ment in her favour of questions affecting the boundaries between her Colonies of Erythrea, Somaliland, and Libya and the contiguous French and British Colonies.&quot; In the original draft of the Treaty the French Colony of Obok-Jibuti (French Somaliland) is expressly excluded from this promise.   The sentence runs as follows : &quot; Ces compensations, toutefois, ne seront pas prises sur la Colonie francaised&apos;Obock-Djibouti, dont le territoire est trop restreint pour &amp;tre diminue et lasituation trop importante sur la route de iTndo-Chine et de Madagascar pourpermettre une cession quelconque.&quot;The Committee are given to understand that, although the French Government consented to eliminate this reservation from the text of the treaty, they intimated to the Italians that they meant to maintain it in substance.30. The wording of this, article, in so far as it relates to the African colonies, on the face of it does not seem to imply more than rectifications of frontier. The words &quot; equitable compensation&quot; might, however, be taken as pointing to some territorial concession there or elsewhere, or possibly to financial assistance. So far as the African colonies are concerned, it would appear that, if concessions are made to Erythrea, they would have to be made by Great Britain on the Sudan frontier ; and unless an exchange of French Somaliland for the Gambia were effected, in which case the French Government would contribute indirectly, the extension of Italian Somaliland would also be at the expense exclusively either of British Somaliland or British East Africa, or both. In regard to Libya, it is not known to the Committee what would satisfy the Italians on the French Tunis frontier, and the Committee are ignorant whether the French Government are prepared to meet them in any way.31. The Egyptian-Libyan frontier, in any case, requires demarcation from the Egyptian point of view. The present line renders the harbour of Sollum, which is Egyptian, untenable by us, while it leaves the adjacent little bay of Porto Bardia equally useless to the Italians (see Appendix (I)). It is suggested by Sir Reginald Wingate that this boundary should be treated independently of other frontiers and on its merits. The line of boundary proposed by Lord Kitchener, which would include Porto Bardia in Egyptian territory, and would thus assure the safety of Sollum could, in his opinion, be made acceptable to Italy, if the Egyptian claim to the Senussist oasis and shrine of Jaghbub were withdrawn and the oasis placed within the Italian sphere. He considers that the exclusion of all entirely Senussist settlements from Egyptian territory is desirable, and would remove a certain source of friction between Egypt and her, Italian neighbour. He desires, however, to reserve for the present his final opinion on the cession of Jaghbub.32. As against the cession of Jaghbub it has been pointed out to the Committee by Sir H. McMahon that the cession of this oasis with the ancestral shrine of the Senussi sect, while liable to offend the sentiment of the Egyptian Government, would deprive us of an influence in Senussi affairs which, in the not impossible contingency of the failure of the Italian Government to control that sect, might hereafter be essential for the preservation ^ of the tranquillity of the Egyptian frontier. The General Staff, moreover, are on military grounds (see Appendix (I)) strongly opposed to the cession of Jaghbub, and also recommend a revision in our favour of the frontier at Sollum. The Committee^ however, recognise that this would be the reverse of a settlement of the frontier in favour of Italy, and may be impossible of realisation, even if the question be dealt with independently, as recommended by Sir B. Wingate.^ 33. Failing that, and in the event of its proving impossible to satisfy Italian claims in any other way, the Committee realise that it may be necessary, whilst retaining Jaghbub, to cede Sollum. The Western frontier of Egypt might then be fixed as follows : Starting from a point along the coast 11 miles east by south of Sollum and continuing in a straight line to the intersection of the 24th meridian of longitude [408] D
east with the 30th parallel of latitude north, and thence following the 24th meridian as at present. This concession, although not large territorially, is important to the Italians as Sollum is the starting point of the caravan route to Jaghbub, and a principal market of the Senussi community.34. In regard to the Sudan frontier of Erythrea, Sir R. Wingate can suggest no transfer of territory that would not seriously complicate tribal affairs, and consequently lead to friction between the neighbouring administrations. Sir Henry McMahon concurs, and points out the vital importance of excluding any other foreign Power from the drainage area of the Tsana Lake and Blue Nile. The Committee are therefore unable to recommend any concession on this frontier.35. In regard to Italian Somaliland, much would depend upon the possibility of our acquiring French Somaliland, in which case there would be less difficulty providing that satisfactory arrangements could be made for the food supply of Aden, which at present gets most of its meat from Berbera in ceding British Somaliland and its hinterland to Italy. This would be more than a mere rectification of frontier and would partake of the nature of &quot; equitable compensation.&quot; It is doubtful, however, whether Italy would consider even the cession of the whole of this colony as &apos;; equitable&quot; com-pensation, and it is probable that her aspirations lie in the direction of territorial extension in British East Africa. If this should prove to be the case, it would be necessary to examine her proposals on their merits. With this possibility in mind the Committee are collecting further information from the economic and administrative point of view as regards the Juba valley and the adjacent region of British East Africa, including the port of Kismayu.36. If no deal is possible over French Somaliland, and if the French refuse compensation to the Italians on the Tunis frontier, the whole onus of fulfilling the treaty obligations will fall on Great Britain. In this case, Great Britain would be equitably entitled to compensation from the French Government, a point which should be borne in mind in our negotiations with that Government.37. There is, however, the possibility of another solution which is recommended by Sir R. Wingate and by Sir H. McMahon, namely, the adoption of the policy advocated by Lord Kitchener in 191.4 of partitioning Abyssinia into spheres of influence. In that case Ttaly could receive a share which would probably satisfy her aspirations (see Appendix (A)). The Committee understand that this question is now under the consideration of -His Majesty&apos;s Government. They are therefore unable at present to make any recommendations on this subject.Anglo-Russian Desiderata.38. The only British territorial desideratum so far indicated to Russia, in return for British support of the Russian acquisition of Constantinople and the Dardanelles, is the revision of the 1907 Agreement with regard to Persia, so as to include the neutral sphere laid down in that Agreement as part of the British sphere. To this the Russian 1 Government has agreed in principle, though it will probably ask for certain assurances of liberty of action in the Russian sphere (see Appendix (J)\ It is understood that this question is being dealt with by another Committee. Other desiderata might presumably concern the position in Chinese Turkestan and Tibet.Belgium and the Allies.39. An account of Belgian co-operation in the conquest of German East Africa, and a statement of Belgian claims, will be found in Appendix (K). The Committee are informed that Belgian assistance has been of a - substantial character, and that without it warlike operations would have been greatly prolonged. They understand that the Belgian Government have no territorial ambitions in German East Africa beyond a rectification of frontier in the neighbourhood of Lake Kivu, but that they Toughly value their acquisitions in German East Africa at: (1;) The Kabinda enclave, belonging to Portugal, on the right bank of the Congo, and at a tract of territory on the left bank of the Congo also belonging to Portugal. These tracts are desired in order that Belgium may obtain full control of the mouth of the Congo, and in order to extend the Atlantic coast-line of the Congo State.(2.) An indemnity to cover their military expenditure and the losses resulting to the Belgian Congo in the-East African campaign.
(3 ) A substantial indemnity for the release of the territory and railway now in Belgian occupation, the latter alone being valued in their opinion at 170,000,000 fr.(4.) Such modifications as they may desire in the Berlin General Act.40. The Committee recognise that it may be difficult to deal with any of these Belgian desiderata entirely independently of the European settlement, but subject to this reservation they recommend that: -(1.) The Belgian Government should not be permitted to retain any portion of German East Africa, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be ready to consider favourably a rectification of the Congo frontier near Lake Kivu.(2.) His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to use their good offices with&apos; the Portuguese Government to promote the attainment of Belgian aspirations at the mouth of the Congo.(3.) The request for an indemnity to. be paid to Belgium, in connection with the Belgian operations in Africa, while it can hardly he separated from the general question of the reparation due to Belgium from Germany, should, if put at the conclusion of the war, be met in a sympathetic and liberal spirit.Portugal and the Allies, 41. Portugal will have a general claim to recognition from the Allies after the war. As far as territory is concerned, she is understood to be anxious to secure the small triangle of German East Africa between the mouth of the llovuma and Cape Delgado, and to desire a settlement in.her favour of the disputed point as to the exact delimitation of the frontier between Angola and German South-West Africa. But in the main she will expect her reward in the shape of capital to be spent in opening up her present undeveloped territories. There are reasons for believing that there is a strong movement in Portugal in favour of the development of the Portuguese colonies with the help of British capital.42. In connection with the general position of the Portuguese territories in Africa the Committee draw attention to the point that the war has terminated the Anglo-German agreements of 1898 which made provision for the eventual absorption, by mortgage, of the Portuguese African territories by Great Britain and Germany. The terms of these agreements were briefly that Germany should not object to our acquisition of Portuguese Mozambique south of.the Zambesi and west of the Shire, while we should not object to Germany&apos;s acquiring the rest of Portuguese Mozambique.north of the Zambesi and east of the Shire. As regards Angola, a partition was contemplated : the northern and southern portions being assigned to Germany, while the middle portion was assigned to Great Britain.   -.43. It is doubtful whether the Portuguese Government would or could agree to any arrangement involving -an extensive alienation of Portuguese territories or sovereign rights, except possibly for an equivalent territorial quid pro quo. They are exceedingly sensitive in this respect,-more especially as regards Delagoa Bay. It is understood, in fact, that one of the determinant factors for Portugal&apos;s active participation in the war was the conviction that military co-operation against the common enemy would render it impossible for a British Government in honour to permit any encroachment on the territorial or sovereign rights of her Ally. As a measure of precaution, however, the Committee suggest that in any arrangements made for financial assistance to Portugal at the conclusion of the war, in connection with the development of her African colonies or otherwise, stipulations should be inserted against the alienation by Portugal of these territories to any other Power.44. The arguments which make it desirable to eliminate the French from India make it also desirable, though perhaps less urgent, more particularly in respect of cables and wireless telegraphy, to eliminate the Portuguese settlements also. These settlements Goa, Daman, andDiu include some 1,500 square miles, with a population of 500,000 and a considerable trade. It would not be easy to-find suitable territory to exchange for those settlements in Africa. Portuguese pride would probably forbid their sale, but it might be possible to arrange a long-term lease by transferring to Portugal a portion of the instalments of the French debt to us. With the abrogation of Portuguese direct sovereignty in India would also - go- the anachronism by which Portugal still retains the right to appoint six Roman. Catholic :bishops in British India (see Appendix (L)).
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 28, 1917.45. The growing importance in modern warfare of cable landing stations, wireless telegraph stations, and submarine bases renders it a matter of serious consequence that no foreign power should acquire any of the Portuguese islands such as the Azores. Madeira, or Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic, or Portuguese Timor in the East Indies. The Committee recommend that in any general arrangement arrived at with Portugal provision should be made against the alienation of these islands or of the Portuguese colonies in India.Japan and China.46. The allotment to Japan of Germany&apos;s rights in the Shantung Peninsula and of the German Pacific Islands north of the Equator has, it is understood, already been agreed to in principle by the British Government. Where the need for delimitation and adjustment is still required is with regard to the succession to German rights and concessions in China outside the Shantung Peninsula. It is very undesirable from the point of view of India that Japan should establish herself in the provinces of Szechuan and Yunnan, and it is suggested that if Japan is to take over any German interests, they should be confined to the actual province of Shantung and its neighbourhood. The question is exhaustively dealt with in a memorandum (see Appendix (M)) prepared by the Foreign Office for the information of the War Cabinet.Ceuta and Gibraltar.47. The question of the possible acquisition from Spain of Ceuta and some of the surrounding territory in exchange for Gibraltar has been brought before the Committee, who realise that considerable political advantages in our relationship with Spain might accrue from such a transfer. But the naval and military considerations involved are of so highly technical a character that the Committee do not feel themselves competent to make any definite recommendation on the subject. They would urge, however, that the consideration of the question in all its bearings should be undertaken without delay.Considerations arising out of possible Future Developments of Aviation.48. The recommendations made by the Committee have not taken into account any of the considerations which arise in connection with the possible future development of aviation (see Appendix (H) to Second Interim Eeport). The Committee are of opinion that it would be desirable that the views of the Air Board, which has not been repre-sented upon the Committee, should be ascertained.LOUIS MALLET (Chairman).W.

A communication from the Emperor Menelek dated 8th August, 1904, the translation of which is annexed to the present Agreement, inviting the company to whom the above concession was granted to construct the second section of the line from Dire Dawa to Adis Ababa;Art. 6. The three Governments agree that the Jibuti Railway shall be prolonged from Dire Dawa to Adis Ababa, with a branch line to Harrar eventually, either by the Ethiopian Railway Company in virtue of the deeds enumerated in the preceding article, or by any other private French company which may be substituted therefor, with the consent of the French Government, on condition that the nationals of the three countries shall enjoy in all matters of trade and transit absolute equality of treatment on the railway and in the port of Jibuti. Goods shall not he subject to &amp;nj fiscal transit duty levied for the benefit of the French colony or Treasury.Art. 7. The French Government will endeavour to arrange that an English, an Italian, and an Abyssinian Representative shall be appointed to the Board of the French Company or Companies which may be entrusted with the construction and working of the railway from Jibuti to Adis Ababa. The British and Italian Governments will reciprocally endeavour to arrange that a French Director shall in like manner and on the same conditions be appointed to the Board of any English or Italian Company which has been or may be formed for the construction or working of railways running from any point in Abyssinia to any point in the adjoining English or Italian territory. It is likewise agreed that the nationals of the three countries shall enjoy in all matters of trade and transit absolute equality of treatment, both on the railways which may be constructed by English or Italian Companies, and in the English or Italian ports from which these railways may start. Goods shall not be subject to any fiscal transit duty levied for the benefit of the British or Italian Colonies or Treasuries.The three Signatory Powers agree to extend to the nationals of all other countries the benefit of the provisions of articles 6 and 7 relating to equality of treatment as regards trade and transit.Art. 8. The French Government will abstain from all interference as regards the Concession previously granted beyond Adis Ababa.Art. 9.

The three Governments are also agreed that all construction of railways in Ethiopia, joining the Benadir to Erythrsea to the west of Adis Ababa, shall, in so far as foreign assistance is required, be carried out under the auspices of Italy.The Government of His Britannic Majesty reserve to themselves the right, in case of need, to make use of the authorisation, granted by the Emperor Menelek on the 28th August, 1904, to construct a railway from British Somaliland through Ethiopia to the Soudanese frontier, on condition, however, that they previously come to an agree-ment with the French and Italian Governments, the thiee Governments undertaking not to construct without previous agreement any line entering Abyssinian territory or intended to join the Abyssinian lines, which would compete directly with those estab-lished under the auspices of any one of them.Art. 10. The Representatives of the three Powers will keep each other fully informed, and will co-operate for the protection of their respective interests. In the event of the British, French, and Italian Representatives being unable to agree, they will refer to their respective Governments, suspending all action meanwhile.Art. 11. Beyond the Ageements enumerated in articles 1 and 5 of the present Convention, no Agreement concluded by any one of the Contracting Powers concerning Ethiopia shall affect the other Signatory Powers of the present Agreement.Done at London, 13th December, 1906.E.

APPENDIX (B). I.Sheikh Said and Muscat. Note by the Admiralty.THE inclusion of Sheikh Said within the Aden Protectorate is, as has been shown from the experience of this war, necessary for the security of Perim. This is essentially in the nature of a military rectification of frontier, and it may therefore he assumed that it was present to the mind of the French Government when they assented to &quot; such rectification of the Aden frontier as may be deemed necessary in consequence of recent Turkish aggression.&quot; It is difficult to believe that in face of this assent they will seriously press their shadowy claim to Sheikh Said, even though the passage quoted may not in itself have any relevance to existing French interests.In the opinion of the Admiralty, it should be made clear in any discussions with the French that the inclusion of Sheikh Said in the Aden Protectorate is considered by us to be covered by the &quot; necessary rectification ;&apos; of the Aden frontier, which is specially excepted in paragraph 10 of the Arab State Agreement.The position as regards Muscat is dealt with in detail in the annexed memorandum by Sir Edmond Slade. Part of this memorandum will more directly concern the Persia Sub-Committee, but the significance of matters in Muscat lies in their relation to the general situation in the Persian Gulf.From this memorandum, which has the general concurrence of the Admiralty, it will be seen that the danger of French claims in Muscat is not considered serious when once the Arms Traffic question has been satisfactorily settled. Provided no territorial rights can be acquired, by France or any other Power, in Muscat or elsewhere in the Gulf of Oman or Persian Gulf, we are not likely ourselves to want the Musandim Peninsula or other territorv on the southern side of the entrance of the Gulf. The complete exclusion of all French interests from Muscat would be a convenience, but cannot, be described as a necessity from a naval standpoint.The settlement of the Arms Traffic Question is of course a naval as well as axpolitical and military interest, and it is assumed in the foregoing remarks that a satisfactory&quot; settlement will be arranged.Admiralty, November 4, 1916.II.The Political Position in the Persian Gulf at the end of the War.Memorandum by Vice-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade.It must be assumed that we do not intend to abrogate any of our actual rights and position as the paramount Power in the Persian Gulf which has been acknowdedged now for practically a century without any rival. Our Treaties with the local Chiefs begin about the year 1820, and since that time we have systematically asserted our supremacy and have maintained peace and freedom for maritime traffic within the Gulf. This has not been clone without the expenditure of life and money, but on the whole there have been few relapses, and notwithstanding the wild and lawdess nature of the tribes inhabiting its coasts, the Persian Gulf has been wonderfully free from serious trouble.So far we have not annexed any territory (with the exception of a square mile of land at Basidu at the western end of the Island of Kishm in 1820), on either side of the Gulf, but we have a practical protectorate over the pirate coast of a somewhat indefinite character, a more definite protectorate over Bahrein, and concessions for telegraph stations at Bushire, Henjam, Jashk, and Charbar in Persia. These stations are held by the Government of India, and a small number of troops are maintained at them for local defence against marauders.At the end of the 18th century, the Sultan of Muscat exercised a much greater influence in the Gulf than he does at present, and in 1798 a treaty was concluded with him for the purpose of excluding French influence from his territories. At that time Muscat and Zanzibar were under the same ruler, and he also held large territories on the Persian coast, including Bander Abbas and Kishm.
In 1856, when the theu Sultan died, the Persian territories, including the islands, nad been lost, the dispute as to which of his sons should succeed him being settled by the Viceroy by the separation of the two territories of Muscat and Zanzibar. Zanzibar was assigned to one brother, who agreed, in consideration of receiving the richer share, to pay a subsidy of o,760 . a year to the other, who took Muscat.In 1873 the British Government took over the payment of this subsidy as consideration for certain settlements with Zanzibar concerning the Slave Trade, and the payments have been made regularly ever since, subject to good behaviour on the part of the Sultan. The occasions on which payment has been withheld are very rare. The Government of India has always supported the reigning Sultan, and at times has given him effective assistance to maintain his position ; in fact, without British support, Muscat would, have ceased to exist as a State under the present dynasty long ago., Although the Treaty of 1798 aimed at excluding France altogether from Muscat in the course of the first half of the 19th century, she succeeded in obtaining such treaties with the Sultan that, when the partition was decided upon, the Government felt obliged to consult her about it. In 1862, as the result of fresh pressure on the part of the French, an agreement was signed by which each country undertook to respect the independence of Muscat and Zanzibar.Muscat has commercial treaties with the United States, France, and the Nether-lands besides the treaties with Great Britain, and these treaties have at one time or another been a source of considerable embarrassment in our dealings with that State.In 1891 the Sultan entered into an agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any of the territories of Muscat or her dependencies, except to Great Britain, but in 1894 France, instigated it is thought by Russia, sent a vice-consul to Muscat who immediately began to intrigue against us. The result was the French endeavour to obtain the lease of Bander Gisseh as a coaling station, which was objected to hy Great Britain on the ground that the Sultan was not at liberty to alienate any territory by reason of the Treaty of 1891, and also that it was contrary to the stipulation of the Treaty of 186:!, whereby each country agreed to respect the territorial integrity of Muscat.It was finally agreed that France could have a coaling station on the same terms as those on which Great Britain holds her coaling station, namely, on sufferance, and, in fact, a small portion of the latter was handed over to the French., who have, however, never made effective use of jt.Arising out of the activities of the French consul at Muscat a further dispute arose between His Majesty&apos;s Government and France over the right of dhows, which had been entered at the French Consulate as the property of French proteges, and therefore as being entitled to French protection, to fly the French flag, and in consequence to be immune from the right of visit and search by British cruisers engaged in either the suppression of the slave trade or the arms traffic.This right, if substantiated, would have enabled the French, in whose hands the greater part of the arms traffic was centred, to have carried it on in spite of all our efforts to stop it. The dispute was referred to The Hague, and the awrard was in effect to put a term to the practice of granting French protection, but recognising the vessels already registered. No person who was pot a bond fide French protege before .1863 can claim to continue a licence in the event of a licensed dhow being lost.The arms traffic, as stated, above, was mainly in the hands of the French agents, and tliere were several Arms involved, but the effect of systematic operations to kill the trade was to make it so unprofitable as to drive them all out except one firm, that of M. Goguyev. This firm, which has also large interests in the arms trade at Jibutil, obtained considerable hold over the Sultan by advancing him monev against the Customs receipts, and, in consequence, it has always been a most difficult matter to deal with them. Their position, however, in 1914 had been considerably weakened, and it is probable that they could be bought out if it was considered advisable to do so.If this firm could be induced to withdraw entirelv from Muscat, there would then be no French interests, except on paper, to prevent us from coming to an agreement with them if necessary.it will be seen from the chart that we alreadv hold certain rights over a considerable portion of the coast at the southern entrance to the Persian Gulf, and that little more is required than to consolidate our position. The Musandim Peninsula, which has been recognised as belonging to Muscat, is separated from that State by a strip of territory belonging to the Trucial Chief, the Sheikh of Sharjah, whose domains
are subject to an ill-defined British protectorate. &apos; It would perhaps be possible to round it off by absorbing the Musandim Peninsula, but it is not necessary so long as no other nation is allowed to&quot; obtain a footing there. From this point of view it might be as well to maintain the Anglo-French Agreement of 1862, because it would probably assist in this object. If we come to the conclusion that it is not necessary actually to absorb the Peninsula so as to safeguard our position at the entrance to the Gulf, we shall not have to ask France to abandon the Treaty of 1862, which may considerably simplify our negotiations with her. All we really want from her is a recognition of our Treaty of 1891 with the Sultan and an agreement about the arms traffic, and this should form part of the general settlement, including not only the Persian Gulf, but also Jibutil, Abyssinia, Somaliland. and the Bed Sea.As a naval station the Musandim Peninsula is of little use. The anchorages are all bad, and in the summer time the. climate is insupportable. Kubbat Ghazira is the only one that appeared to have decent holding ground, but even that was not good. Khor Kawi, which has been reported on as a suitable anchorage, I know from practical experience during the operations on the Biyaban coast in 1910 not to be safe.. The situation with regard to the Persian side is more important on account of the Admiralty interest in the Anglo-Persian oil concession, and the consequent necessity of securing that under no possible circumstances can we be disturbed in our enjoyment of those rights. ^ *&apos;The concession covers the whole of Persia except the provinces bordering on the Caspian, and the area over which oil is known to exist is about equal to that of France and Germany combined. So far two prolific fields have been struck, but only a small part of the concession has been examined. We are drawing oil from one of these fields in large and increasing quantities.The importance of this concession lies in the fact that, if our hold over it is consolidated, it will enable us to make ourselves entirely independent of the United States for all oil products. After the present wards over anything may happen while the world is settling down to normal peace conditions again and readjusting their commercial relations. If we remain dependent on the United States for the greater part of our oil fuel, as at present, our hands are tied ; it is therefore of supreme importance to provide ourselves with an alternative source of supply which is independent of foreign control at the earliest possible moment.The only known large source from which oil can be drawn that is not under foreign control is covered by the Anglo-Persian concession, and it is therefore important that we consolidate our position there and secure, so far as it is possible, our hold on the oil-producing lands.The importance of this is best illustrated by figures. The war expenditure of oil fuel is at the rate of 3,000,000 tons a year, and it will probably shortly reach the rate of 3,500,000 tons. At the present moment our estimated supplies for the next twelve months will come from : The United States British Colonies British India.. Anglo-Persian Mexico BorneoTons. 2,000,000 50,000 10,000 400,000 300,000 48,000United Kingdom shale oil        .. .. ... .. .. 35,000,,        ,,    creosote        .. .. ,. .. .. 65,000Total    .. .. .. ..       2,908,000It is under consideration to.push forward the development of the Anglo-Persian field, so that we may be able to draw from it: Tons.Fuel oil in 1917 .. .. .. .. 600,0001918 .. .. .. .. .. ..       1,000,0001919 .. .. .. .. .. .        ..       1.500,0001920 .. .. 2,000,000In this manner we shall be in the position of being-&apos;able to make ourselves independent of the United States for this vital commodity.Every 1,000,000 tons of crude oil will give on refining approximately 600,000 to 700,000 tons fuel oil, 90,000 tons petrol, 80,000 tons lighting oil, 20,000 lubricating oil, 15,000 paraffin wax, besides other products. We shall therefore also be able to [408] F
supply a large part of other necessary petroleum products besides fuel oil from a source which is free of the control of the United States.Oil fuel is rapidly taking the place of coal, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to the Admiralty to see that the country secures the control of as large sources of supply as possible. A great deal of the success with which we have been able to control.neutral shipping has been due to our control of coal, and we must at all costs endeavour to continue that control even though oil takes the place of coal. The present oil-field that is being worked is a very rich one, but it is not inexhaustible, and we must look to extend our operations over the whole area of the concession, but in order to do so political control is absolutely essential.We own the rights in Persia, and we must control that portion of the country in which oil is found in such a way that it can be got at and exported to us in safety.There are, besides, indications of oil in Mesopotamia, Koweit, Bahrein, and in Arabia. It is important to secure control of all the oil rights in these areas so that no other Power can exploit them for their benefit.In Mesopotamia and Arabia the oil rights should be expressly reserved in those territories which will form the projected Arab State. In Koweit the late Sheikh has given His Majesty&apos;s Government certain undertakings, and these should be confirmed by his successor. In Bahrein the Government of India has been requested to see that the oil rights are not let to any but British firms. In that part of Mesopotamia over which His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain direct administrative authority similar precautions should be taken.In order that there should be proper supervision over the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab, it is necessary that British control should be maintained over it, and that no foreign interest should be allowed to obtain a footing. The traffic in and out-with oil alone will render it necessary to maintain the waterway always open and free from vexatious restrictions, such as might be imposed if the river comes under any other control than British. The total number of vessels annually going to Abaclan for oil may be expected to exceed 300 in a few years&apos; time, and therefore the matter is one of importance.The position that we should try to obtain therefore is that the provinces of Kermanshah, Luristan, Arabistan, and theBakhtiari country, Pars, including Laristan, Kerman, including Bashakird and Makran, must be entirely under British control. We shall then be able to develop the oil concession in such a manner as to ensure that while drawing sufficient for our needs we conserve our supplies as much as possible. We shall also be able to push the development of other minerals, of wdiich there is reported to be a considerable quantity, particularly in Kerman and Fars.If we cannot obtaiu the complete control of these provinces in Persia, we should at least complete the negotiations that have already been commenced with the Persian Government for the transfer of the islands to British sovereignty. This will give us the virtual control of the Gulf, and with it sufficient influence to maintain order, at any rate, in the coastal districts, so long as other European interests are not allowed to obtain a footing in Southern Persia.Closely connected with the problem of the development of the oil resources of Persia is that of the railways, and the two ought to be dealt with together. The oil will supply cheap fuel, which is necessary for the economical development of the railways, and therefore it is important to plan them with a view of tapping the oil districts.On the Arabian side of the Gulf we should obtain the continuation of the arrangements made with the late Sheikh of Koweit, and an agreement with the present Sheikh to give us fulTrights to explore and develop any oil that may be found in his territories.E.

APPENDIX (C).Extract from India Office Memorandum.Sheikh Said.WE have given assurances to the Arabs that we do not intend to make annexa-tions, and we have agreed jointly with the French not to do so with the proviso, however, that &quot;ceci n&apos;empeehera pas telle rectification de la frontiere d&apos;Aden qui pourra etre jugee necessaire, par suite de la recente agression des Turcs&quot; (article 10 of M. Cambon&apos;s note referred to above).   This proviso was inserted for two reasons : (a.) Because it is not certain that the existing frontier divides the tribes in thebest possible way. (b.) Because we might find it necessary to take over Sheikh Said.This fortified promontory is within gunshot of our station on Perim Island, which has, in fact, been bombarded from it during the war. We ejected the Turks in December 1914, but allowed them to return, and they have been entrenched there ever since. It may seem desirable, in order to make a repetition impossible, and at the same time to secure Sheikh Said against French claim, to annex the peninsula. The Government of India are content to leave it to the neighbouring Arabs. In that case we must induce the French formally to withdraw their claim, whether in virtue of the terms of our agreement or by offering them compensation elsewhere. Their claim dates from 1869, when two Frenchmen purchased the place from the local Sheikh for 80,000 dollars. The Porte denied the right of the Sheikh to sell, but the French, though they occupied, the place for a very short time, have never abandoned their interest in it, and have always evaded recognising it as Turkish territory. In 1893 M. Deloncle urged in the Chamber the importance of occupying it; and as recently as November 1914 a company styling itself the &quot; Ouest Asiatique Compagnie internationale de 1&apos;Arable &quot; claimed to have acquired the rights of the original proprietors. It appeared on enquiry that the company was not registered, and that its spokesman was &quot; of the shadiest character&quot; (Sir F. Bertie, No. 9, 10th January, 1915). Nothing more has been heard of it, but it would seem desirable to set the question at rest once for all.It should be noticed that Sheikh Said is situated in a triangular area, measuring some 550 square miles, having the sea at its base, and immediately adjoining the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, which the Turkish Government agreed, after the Aden Delimitation Commission in 1905, not to alienate &quot; de quelque maniere que ce soit.&quot; An instrument confirming this agreement was signed on the 9th March, 1914, and was awaiting ratification when the war broke out (Appendix (C)). The ejection of the Turks from Arabia will thus expose this piece of territory a fact which makes it desirable that we should not tie our hands more tightly than is necessary in this region.APPENDIX (D).Extract from Dr. Franz Stuhlmann&apos;s &quot;The Fight for Arabia between Turkey and England.&quot;   (Chapter VIII.)Sheikh Said.IN L734 Admiral la Bourdonnais obtained a cession of the Cape from the native Sultan. Louis XVI is even said to have kept an agent there. Napoleon Bonaparte instructed General Bon to occupy the place, but nothing was done. In 1828 Mehemed Ali was instructed by the French Government to occupy it. When he wished to do so ten years later, the French Government no longer supported him, for England opposed this expedition.   When England in 1839 had occupied Aden, and in 1857 Perim, her
interest in Sheikh Said was perhaps lost. At all events, she allowed the district to be sold to a French company in 1868, and the contract was registered by the French Consulate in Aden on &quot;the 14th October, 1868. England tried to upset the purchase and caused the Governor of the Hejaz to protest on the ground that Sheikh Said belonged to Turkey. The French -Ministry, of Perim sent Lieutenant Vidal to the spot, who established the validity of the contract, which was confirmed on the 21st December, 1869, the period for payment being prolonged to the 1st December,. 1870. Payments were made regularly. The Societe de Bab el-Mandeb (founded by MM. Rabaud Bazin, of Marseilles) sent a comite d&apos;etudes to Arabia. On the 4th June, 1 870, the Governor of Mocha occupied Sheikh Said, and the French consul at Aden protested. After negotiations in Paris and Constantinople, the Turks admitted the regularity of the purchase, but as the Governor of Mocha did not withdraw, the company stopped its payments to the Sheikh and interrupted its work. In 187!. Rear-Admiral Lallemand deposited oil, and probably also coal, at Sheikh Said. In 1876 Monsieur Suel tried to sell the district to the French Government, but consideration of the proposal was deferred. In 1884 the Italian Government approached the. Marseilles company with a view to sale. Two million francs were asked. It was said that Germany. Russia, England, and Spain were interested, but that the others went no further in the matter for fear of annoying England. In 1885 the French traveller Soleillet wrote &quot;one of the keys of the Red Sea is in our hands. Shall we abandon it ? By occupying Sheikh Said we can keep the Suez Canal open.&quot; On the 7th December, 1896, Deloncle maintained French rights at Sheikh Said in the French Chamber. If is said that in 1898 France bought the district from the company and declared it a French colony. Nevertheless, the Turkish Government sent troops there on the 19th October, 1902. A new attack w-as begun by French interests in 1904. M. Presseq-Rolland, afterwards editor of the &quot;Depeche de Toulouse,&quot; concluded a new contract with the son of the Sultan. Mohamed Ali Tabat Durein, wdio had died in the meantime; but the purchase was disallowed by his Government. During the war between Italy and Turkey the Turkish garrison was increased to 4,000. At the end of 1913 French interests made another attempt. M. Albert Corbie, who has written a book on the subject, and who was clearly the head of the Cabinet d&apos;Etudes techniques des Houillieres et du Port de Cheikh Said, visited Jibuti in October. Apparently he received no encouragement from the Governor of Jibuti or the French vice-consul at Aden; and when it proved impossible to go to Sheikh Said, owing to the presence of the Turkish garrison, he was obliged to return to France.* * * -s- * *&quot; It is very important at the conclusion of a peace favourable to Turkey to examine the question of Sheikh Said closely, and, if possible, to secure that the frontier with English territory is carried at some distance from the cape, and not in accordance with the demarcation of 1905. It will be for consideration later, after careful military and technical study, whether not only strong Turkish fortifications, but also harbour works can be constructed there, and whether it is possible to bring a railway from the north there. At all events, Sheikh Said is for the Red Sea an extraordinarily important place.&quot;APPENDIX (E).Memorandum by the India. Office.French Possessions in India. 1. The French possessions in India fall under two heads, viz. : (1.) Settlements held in full sovereignty and administered by French resident officials ; and(2.) Certain scattered patches of land, known as the Locjes, the sites of former Frauch factories, over which the French Government claim to exercise certain rights of jurisdiction.
2. The Settlements are five in number, viz. : -	Area in	Population	Square Miles.	in 1901.(1.) Pondicberry and its dependencies	115	174,450(2.) Karikal...	53	56,600(3.) Mahe    ...	26	10,300(4.) Yanaon ...	5	5,000(5.) Uhandernagore	4	26,800Of these, Nos. 1-4 are all situated on the coast and within the limits of the Madras Presidency. Chandernagore is on the Kiver Hooghly, some 20 miles north of Calcutta. The Pondicherry Settlement, it may be observed, is not a compact block of territoty, but comprises, besides the main settlement on the coast, in which the town of Pondicherry is situated, some ten isolated strips of French territory in the adjoining British district. The main settlement itself is very irregular in shape, dovetailing in and out with British territory; it also contains a British enclave approximately in its centre.The Loges.3. The French Loges are situated at the following places :  	Province.	Area of Loge.(1.) Masulipatam ... (2.) Calicut (3.) Dacca (2) (4.) Balasore (5.) Ghoorpuda  ... (6.) Surat(2)	Madras         ... ,,              ... Bengal Bihar and Orissa ))           )) Bombay-	67 acres. 6 acres. 5 and 36 acres. 38 acres. 2 roods. 2^ and 19 J acres.The French also claim rights, or did when the question was under discussion in 1885, over further small areas at (7) Patna, in Bihar and Orissa, and at (8) Caziuibazar and (9; Jugdea or Jongdia, in Bengal. The Government of India repcrted, however, on the 11th September, 1885, that &quot;/there is no evidence forthcoming that since 1815 the French have exercised any rights in the ancient loges&quot; at these three places. Another place at which there was formerly a French factory is (10) Berhampore, in Bengal. As to this place the Bengal Government reported in 1882 : &quot; There was formerly a loge .... in Berhampore, but it is no longer in existence; the land on which the factory buildings stood was held on lease by the French, but it always has been, and is now, under the jurisdiction of the British Courts.&quot;The French do not appear to have claimed this loge in 1885, and could presumably assert no claim to it now.** In August 1884 the draft of a convention was handed to the French Government, of which the preamble ran as follows: &quot;Whereas certain rig-hts and privileges are possessed and exercised by France in the parcels of laud designated &apos; factories&apos; or &apos; loges,&apos; situated at the following places, namely: .(1.) At Masulipatam, in the Madras Presidency. (2.) At Calicut.(3.) At Surat, in the Bombay Presidency. (4.) At Mouzah Balesore, in Bengal.(5.) At Mouzah Ghoorpudab, in Bengal; and whereas, &amp;c.&quot;Commenting on the draft convention in a note to Lord Granville dated January 19, 1885, the French Ambassador remarked:&quot; Ce projet, en enumerant celles des loclaites situees sous la juridiction de la France qui seraient 1&apos;objet de la transaction, ne fait pas mention des autres loges franchises qui existent egalemenr,, a 1&apos;^tat d&quot;enclaves, dans les Indes auglaises, telles que celles de Dacca, Patna, Cazimbazar et Yangdia &quot; ;and M. VVaddington went on to ask for an assurance that there was no intention to call in question the rights of the French Government at these places.   He did not mention &quot;Berhampore.It is to be noted, however, that -Berhampore is among the places mentioned by the &quot; Imperial Gazetteer&quot; (vol iv, p. 123) in the passage dealing with the French loges in India.[4081 &apos; GThe French Settlements.
French Eights in the Loges.4. Even in the areas where the rights of the French Government are more substantial, the extent to which French authority is either admitted or exercised varies in the different cases. Thus, as regards the Dacca Loges, the Government of India reported in 1885 that though the French Government still retained &quot;proprietary rights&quot; in the two plots, they had exercised no &quot; jurisdictional authority&quot; within them for sixty years ; and when the limits of these areas were fixed by local British and French officials in 1908, the Government of India were careful to remind the French authorities that &quot; sovereign rights over the Dacca Loges lie exclusively with the British Government.&quot; On the other hand the French Government apparently regard the two plots at Surat as territory under full French sovereignty, and claim (though we have never admitted the claim) to exercise full and complete jurisdiction over them. As to the two Loges in the Madras Presidency (Masulipatarn and Calicut), the Madras Government reported in 1909 that &quot;all essential rights&quot; are exercised by the British Government, although (i) no municipal taxation is levied, and (ii) the French authorities exercise civil jurisdiction in suits which litigants institute before them. At Balasore, as the Bengal Government reported in 1868, the French Loge &quot; has .... been regarded as the territory of a foreign Power exempt from the jurisdiction of the British Courts,&quot; a doctrine which has resulted in serious administrative inconveniences and abuses.^ The question of this Loge was brought to the notice of the Government of India by the Local Government (Bihar and Orissa) in July 1914.Past Negotiations.5. Negotiations on the subject of the French Settlements in India passed between the French and British Governments in 1857 and again in 1883-85. On the former occasion the object aimed at was the cession of all French territory except Pondicherry and. Karikal; on the latter, the extinction of French rights in the Loges in return for territorial concessions in the Pondicherry region. On neither occasion was any agreement reached.-The question was tentatively raised in 1901 and 1904 ; but it did not again engage the serious attention of the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government until 1909-10, when it was revived in connection with the negotiations then in progress with the French Government regarding the Maskat arms traffic. In a despatch dated the 30th June, 1910, the Government of India submitted proposals for the cession to France of a considerable area of land in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry in exchange for the surrender to Great Britain of all the French settlements in India, other than Pondicherry and the surrounding district, as well as of the scattered Loges. The area to be. ceded to France covered about 138 square miles ; its population was estimated at 98.300, and its annual revenue at about 2,75,000 rupees (18,333L). The territory to be ceded to Great Britain (i e., the four settlements of Karikal, Mahe, Yanaon, and Chandernagore) amounted in all to about .v8 square miles, with a population of some 98,700 persons. The revenue of the French settlements was not known. The Government of India supported their proposals on the ground that &quot; we should derive very considerable advantages from the concentration of French territory in one compact area- and from the control which we should obtain over that dangerous centre of sedition, Ghandernagore.&quot;Chandernagore.6. In the event, the Government of India&apos;s proposals were never placed bofore the French Government. But the question of Chandernagore, which had become more and more prominent in connection, with Indian sedition, was revived by the Viceroy in October 1913. Lord Hardinge pointed out that this town, which was to all intents and purposes a suburb of Calcutta, had become the centre of the chief and most dangerous anarchical conspiracy in India, to which could be traced a number of. recent outrages, including in all probability the attack made upon the Viceroy himself in December 1912. The position of the Government of India had been rendered intolerable by the existence, within a few miles, of Calcutta, of an anarchist centre where plans could be hatched, bombs manufactured, arms imported, emissaries instructed, and.youths depraved with absolute impunity.   Other places might have their seditious organisations, but they* Similar inconveniences at Surat led to a proposal by the Bombay Government in 1912 that an endeavour should be made to obtaij a lease of tlie French lauds by local neg-otiaiion.. The proposal was negatived.
were at least amenable to British law, whereas at Chandernagore our police and magistracy were quite impotent, and, even if the French Government were to send out instructions for more rigorous action, the local authorities were too weak to carry them out.* In view of the growing danger of the situation, Lord Hardinge strongly pressed upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the necessity of coming to some arrangement with France for the transfer of Chandernagore, whether by cession or lease, to British jurisdiction. He threw out the suggestion of a twenty years&apos; lease, failing a more satisfactory arrangement. As a result of the Viceroy&apos;s representations, the matter was brought informally to the notice of the French Government; and Sir E. Grey, during his visit to Paris in April 1914, spoke very plainly on the subject to M. Douuiergue in the course of a conversation at the Quai d Orsay. But, so far as is known at the India Office, no progress has been made towards an agreement.Prospects of a Settlement.7. It is now understood that an opportunity may arise of dealing with the question of the French settlements as part of a wider arrangement with the French Government. From the Indian point of view, the most satisfactory solution would undoubtedly be the complete extinction of French territorial rights of every description throughout India. Inter alia, tins would get rid of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to cable and wireless rights in French India a matter to which the Indian military authorities attach considerable importance from the point of view of censorship requirements in war time. Such a solution involving as it would the final disappearance of the French Empire in India would doubtless be distasteful to French national sentiment. But it might possibly be accepted as part of a general settlement at the conclusion of a victorious war, particularly if France, largely owing to British assistance, had made important acquisitions of territory nearer home. At all events, we might aim at this in the first instance. If the French decline to entertain tiie proposal our main energies must be directed towards securing the cession of Chandernagore. This is a matter of really vital importance, in comparison with which nothing else counts for very much. But it is also very desirable that French rights in the Loges should be extinguished, both on account of the practical inconveniences mentioned above, and because the continued existence of these small enclaves is an anomaly which contains a certain element of danger however slight it may be-to the good relations between ourselves and our allies. It ought to be possible to secure these two desiderata without territorial compensation in India, which is undesirable both in principle and in practice. But if tins proves impossible, an arrangement might be concluded on the lines recommended by the Government of India in 1910 (see paragraph 5), viz.: cession to France of territory round Pondicherry in return for the surrender of all the other settlements and of all French rights in the Loges. In negotiating regarding the Loges it will be desirable to avoid the use of language which may be construed hereafter-in the event of the negotiations failing as an admission of French jurisdictional rights (e.g., at Patna, Cazimbazar, Jugdea, and Dacca), the existence of which we have always denied.Political Department, India Office, April 20, 1915.APPENDIX (F).Extract prom Memorandum by the Coloxjal Office.The Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon.THESE islands were ceded to France for fishing purposes by the Treaty of Versailles ^0. to CO. in 1783, and His Majesty&apos;s Government regard themselves as entitled to the reversion, ^v.:&apos;1^0&quot; as the French Government are aware,   the islands were formerly very valuable to Stonl France on account of the fishing, but latteriy owners who used to fit out their fleet spondence at St. Pierre, and make it their headquarters, find it more profitable to fit out their il! $ vessels in France, and send them direct from France to the Banks, and the fishery and  oT&quot;^&quot;* Besides its connection with sedition, -Chandernagore is the home of a considerable contraband trade.

The islands, therefore, have for France mainly an exchange value, and ic was no doubt because of this that the French Government carried on with us for some time before the war a very leisurely corre spondence with regard to their rights under the Convention of 1904, contending that we had not power to enforce the- fishery regulations for a close time, &amp;c, on the Newfoundland coast, and disputing our jurisdiction in the Bays. Both were paper points, as French fishing vessels had ceased to frequent the coast.On the other hand, Canada, which in 1907 asked us to obtain the cession of the islands from France, and Newfoundland to which they ought, geographically - and historically speaking, to belong, and to either of which a cession to the United States, if it were ever attempted, would be extremely objectionable, have every reason to desire to see the islands British, and an effort ought now to be made to meet their wishes and to obtain possession of them, and a surrender of the French fishery rights on the Newfoundland shore.The present moment is (apart from the advantages offered by a general settlement), specially favourable in that the United States are less likely to object than at any other time.Newfoundland should, if this policy is accepted, be asked whether she would concede in return further facilities for bait for the French bankers.In this connection it maybe observed that the French, in obtaining j)rovisional possession of almost the whole of the Cameroons, laid special stress on the pressure to which the Government was subjected from the Colonial party. It would only be fair to point out to France that, in the matter of the Pacific and of St. Pierre and Miquelon, His Majesty&apos;s Government are subject to the pressure of the public opinion of powerful communities whose wishes they are at all times bound to consider, and that in view of the action of the Dominions in unstintingly devoting their resources of men and money to the common cause, it is doubly difficult for His Majestys Government to resist their pressure in those spheres which the Dominions not unnaturally regard as peculiarly their own.(Initialled) H. J. R.H. L.Colonial Office, September 14, 1914.APPENDIX (G).Extract, from Colonial Office Memorandum, 1908.The Gambia.THE Gambia claims to be one of the oldest British Colonies, the first settlement having been established there in the reign of James I, and there is consequently a sentimental objection to parting with it to another Power. As a Colony it is particularly flourishing, and its trade, imports and exports combined, which in 1906 amounted to 876,0001. (including bullion and specie), is increasing. This commerce is principally carried in British ships, but practically all the exports go to countries outside the United Kingdom, which provides less than half the imports, while only one of the principal firms in the Colony is British, the remainder being almost entirely French. Moreover, the French are in a position to diminish seriously the value of the Gambia by insisting on the fulfilment of Article 5 of the Agreement of the 8th April, 1904, whereby they are given Yarbutenda at the head of the Protectorate, and, should the river there not be open to maritime navigation, access to a point lower down the river, which can be reached by merchant-ships engaged in maritime navigation. Also, in the event of not obtaining the Gambia, the French will probably carry out their project to build a railway parallel to the river, which will considerably damage British trade. As a set-off to these considerations, there remains the fact that the situation of the Gambia is such that it is impossible for the French to prevent smuggling from that Colony into their own possessions, and consequently, so long as it remains British, there is a considerable check on the levying by France of
differential duties in the adjacent territories. In this respect the position is not unlike that at Muscat, where the French rights Under the joint protectorate prevent the adoption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of any effectual measures for restraining the traffic in arms.The strategic value of Bathurst, the capital, as a coaling-station and port of refuge in time of war, is discounted for us by the possession of Sierra Leone. When the question of coaling-stations was examined the relative merits of the two harbours were considered, and the conclusion was arrived at that for British purposes the latter was far preferable, and, moreover, it may be said that the Power that holds the sea holds the Gambia.APPENDIX (H).Italian Claims in Noeth-East Africa.Article 13 of Agreement of April 2(i, 1915.DANS le cas ou la France et la Grande-Bretagne augmenteraient leurs domaines coloniaux d&apos;Afrique aux depens de 1&apos;Allemagne, ces deux Puissances reconnaissent en principe que lTtalie pourrait reclamer quelques compensations equitables, notamment dans le reglement en sa faveur des questions concernant les frontieres des colonies italiennes de 1&apos;Erythree, de la Somalie et de la Lybie et des colonies voisines de la France et de la Grande-Bretagne.APPENDIX (I).Memorandum by War Office.Jaghbvb and Sollum.I. FROM a strategical point of view it is of great importance that Jaghbub should remain within the Egyptian border, as all roads from the west and north-west converge there and then proceed to Siwa, whence they radiate to all the oases of Lower Egypt and to the Mediterranean. Jaghbub may therefore be called the western gateway of Lower Egypt, and as it is protected on the west by a wide belt of waterless desert it forms a strategic point on which the defence of the Western Desert of Egypt may be said to pivot.For military reasons, therefore, the inclusion of Jaghbub in Egyptian territorv is essential to the proper and economical defence of the latter.2. Sollum is the natural port of Jaghbub, and consequently, if the latter is retained, the former should also form part of Egyptian territory. As, however, the present frontier line makes it quite indefensible, and, as Porto Bardiais its necessary appendage, it is requisite that the frontier should be extended so as to start from a point 5 miles west-north-west of Ras-el-Melh, whence it should run to the intersection of the 24th meridian of east longitude with the 30th parallel of north latitude.If Sollum were in the hands of a foreign Power Jaghbub would be dependent on Marsa Matruh as its seaport, a place 90 miles more distant from it than Sollum. This is a disadvantage both commercially and strategically. In fact, an enemy force based on Sollum would be in a position to threaten the principal outpost of the Western Desert of Egypt before the arrival of assistance from Marsa Matruh.War Office, March 28, 1917.
APPENDIX (J).The Anglo-Russian Agreement as to Constantinople and the Dardanelles.Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey-(Received March 27.) (No. 44.   Secret.)Sir, Petrograd, March 13, 1915.IN accordance with, your instructions, and after consultation with my French colleague, I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday morning that, subject to the war being prosecuted to a successful conclusion and to the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised, His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to the Russian aide-memoire on the subject of Constantinople and the Straits, which his Excellency had handed to me on the 4th March, and of which I have the honour to transmit a copy herewith.I at the same time gave his Excellency an aide-memoire to the above effect, embodying your telegram No. 329 of the 10th March, though, in order not to compromise the cypher, I had been obliged to alter the sequence of the words.I then read to him and left with him a memorandum, in which I have recorded the observations which you had, in your telegram No. 43, Private and Secret, of the 11th instant, instructed me to make on the subject of our assent to the Russian demands.Copies of both these documents are enclosed.After expressing in warm terms his satisfaction at receiving this communication, his Excellency said that he had no objections to raise to any of the desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with the sole exception of the conversion into an English sphere of the present neutral sphere in Persia. The question of railways made it very difficult for Russia to renounce all her existing rights in that sphere, and, if she did, she would have to ask us to allow her in return to be absolute mistress in her own sphere.After some further conversation on the subject. I told his Excellency that I had been instructed to make personally to the Emperor the same communication which I had just made to him, and enquired when I could have the honour of an audience. M. Sazonof replied that this would not be &quot;at all easy to arrange, as His Majesty was leaving the next morning for the front, and would probably be engaged with audiences all the afternoon, as he himself was to have one late in the evening. I then suggested that, as the Emperor would probably wish to consult him before replying to the communication which 1 had been instructed to make, His Majesty might perhaps consent to receive us both together. This his Excellency kindly arranged, and I accordingly accompanied him to Tsarskoe.I have, in my telegram No. 54, Private and Secret, of yesterday&apos;s date, reported that the Emperor, in the course of our audience, authorised me to inform you that he consented in principle to the neutral sphere being incorporated in the British sphere, but that M. Sazonof will probably insist on our giving in return some assurances as to Russia&apos;s liberty of action in her own sphere.I have, &amp;c.GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.Enclosure 1.Aide-memoire communicated by M.

Lesdits Gouvernements allies sont assures de rencontrer aupres du Gouvernement Imperial la meme sympathie pour la realisation des desseins qu&apos;ils peuvent former en d&apos;autres regions de 1&apos;Empire ottoman comme ailleurs.Petrograde, le 19 fevrier (4 mars), 1915.. Enclosure 2.Aide-memoire communicated to M. Sazonof, March 12, 191..&apos;).SUBJECT to the war being carried on and brought to a successful conclusion, and to the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere being realised, as indicated in the Russian communication herein referred to, His Majesty&apos;s Government will agree to the Russian Governments aide-memoire relative to Constantinople and the Straits, the text of which was communicated to His Britannic Majestv&apos;s Ambassador by his Excellency M. Sazonof on the 4th March, 1915.Petrograd, February 27 (March 12), 1915.Enclosure 3. Memorandum.HIS Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to make the following observa-tions with reference to the aide-memoire which this Embassy had the honour of addressing to the Imperial Government on the 12th March, 1915.The claim made by the Imperial Government in their aide-memoire of the 4th March, 1915, considerably exceeds the desiderata which were foreshadowed by M. Sazonof as probable a few weeks ago. Before His Majesty&apos;s Government have had time to take into consideration what their own desiderata elsewhere would be in the final terms of peace, Russia is asking for a definite promise that her wishes shall be satisfied with regard to what is in fact the richest prize of the entire war. Sir Edward Grey accordingly hopes that M. Sazonof will realise that it is not in the power of His Majestys Government to give a greater proof of friendship than that which is afforded by the terms of the above-mentioned aide-memoire. That document involves a complete reversal of the traditional policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and is in direct opposition to the opinions and sentiments at one time universally held in England and which have still by no means died out. Sir Edward Grey therefore trusts that the Imperial Government will recognise that the recent general assurances given to M. Sazonof have been most loyally and amply fulfilled. In presenting the aide-memoire now, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe and hope that a lasting friendship between Russia and Great Britain will be assured as soon as the proposed settlement is realised.From the British aide-memoire it follows that the desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government, however important they may be to British interests in other parts of the world, will contain no condition which could impair Russia&apos;s control over the territories described in the Russian aide-memoire of the 4th March, 1915.In view of the fact that Constantinople will always remain a trade entrepot for South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask that Russia shall, when she comes into possession of it, arrange for a free port for goods in transit to and from non-Russian territory. His Majesty&apos;s Government will also ask that^ there shall be commercial freedom for merchant-ships passing through the Straits, as M. Sazonof has already promised.Except in so far as the naval and military operations on which His Majesty&apos;s Government are now engaged in the. Dardanelles may contribute to the common cause of the Allies, it is now clear that these operations, however successful, cannot be
of any advantage to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the final terms of peace. Russia alone will, if the war is successful, gather the direct fruits of these operations. Russia should therefore, in the opinioii of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not now put difficulties in the way of any Power which may, on reasonable terms, offer to co-operate with the Allies. The only Power likely to participate in the operations in the Straits is Greece. Admiral Garden has asked the Admiralty to send him more destroyers, but they have none to spare. The assistance of a Greek flotilla, if it could have beeu secured, would thus have been of inestimable value to His Majesty&apos;s Government.To induce the neutral Balkan States to join the Allies was one of the main objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government had in view when they undertook the operations in the Dardanelles. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that Russia will spare no pains to calm the apprehensions of Bulgaria and Roumania as to Russia&apos;s possession of the Straits and Constantinople being to their disadvantage. His Majesty&apos;s Government also hope that Russia will do everything in her power to render the co-operation of these two States an attractive prospect to them.Sir E. Grey points out that it will obviously be necessaiy to take into considera-tion the whole question of the future interests of France and Great Britain in what is now Asiatic Turkey ; and, in formulating the desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the Ottoman Empire, he must consult the French as well as the Russian Government. As soon, however, as it becomes known that Russia is to have Constantinople at the conclusion of the w^ar, Sir E. Grey will wish to state that throughout the negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Government have stipulated that the Mussulman Holy Places and Arabia shall under all circumstances remain under independent Mussulman dominion.Sir E. Grey is as yet unable to make any definite proposal on any point of the British desiderata; but one of the points of the latter will be the revision of the Persian portion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 so as to recognise the present-neutral sphere as a British sphere.Until the Allies are in a position to give to the Balkan States, and especially to Bulgaria and Roumania, some satisfactory assurance as to their prospects and general position with regard to the territories contiguous to their frontiers to the possession of which they are known to aspire; and until a more advanced stage of the agreement as to the French and British desiderata in the final peace terms is reached, Sir E. Grey points out that it is most desirable that the understanding now arrived at between the Russian, French, and British Governments should remain secret.Petrograd, February 27 (March 12), 1915.APPENDIX (K).Note on Belgian Co-operation in East Africa.I.- Brief Summary of Belgian Operations.SOON after the outbreak of war the Belgian Government urged upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the need of offensive operations against German East Africa from British East Africa, in order to safeguard the Congo against German attack, and they suggested co-operation between the British and Belgian forces. At that time extensive. British operations against German East Africa were not considered practicable. The Belgian Government were informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not at the time commit themselves to operations on a large scale, and the suggested Belgian co-operation was declined. So far as the north-west frontier of German East Africa is concerned, matters remained in this position until the end of 1915.In the meantime; the position on the south-west frontier of German East Africa (Abercorn district) became somewhat insecure and, in view of a threatened attack by the Germans, the local authorities early in 1915, asked for military assistance from the Governor-General of the Congo. In consequence of this request one Belgian battalion was sent to Abercorn, another to the south end of Lake Tanganyika, while two more were held in readiness on the west side of the Lake. In July part of the Belgian troops helped in repelling a German attack against our post at Saisa. About October the two Belgian battalions in Rhodesian territory were withdrawn in order to take part in the offensive campaign which was then in contemplation.
In -this case again it was the Belgian Government which pressed for military co-operation, and it was decided that such co-operation should be arranged by the local authorities. It was accordingly arranged that, while the British forces attacked the German concentration in the Kilimanjaro area, the Belgians should invade Ruanda from Lake Kivu. This scheme was carried out. The Belgians advanced in two columns; the first from the north of Lake Kivu, and the second from the south of Lake Kivu to Usumbura and Ujiji.   Both columns met at Tabora in September 1916.It must be borne in mind that this advance on the part of the Belgians on Tabora would have been impossible but for the assistance afforded to them by the British, as is obvious from the following considerations :  1. Nearly the whole mass of the German forces was drawn off to meet the &quot;Britishattack in the Kilimanjaro and Wilhelmstal districts, and the Belgianadvance met with very little opposition. 2. The Belgians were given great assistance as regards transport of munitions ofwar to the Congo via the Uganda railway.    A munition base was alsoestablished for them at Mombasa. 3. More immediate assistance to their move was afforded by the supply of largenumbers of carriers, without which their advance could not have been . effected.   Uganda recruited many thousands of carriers for this purposealone.4. The British Naval Expedition on Lake Tanganyika had gained command of the Lake for the Belgians and, if this had not been done, they could hardly have advanced in face of the possibility of a German raid across the Lake. British seaplanes, guns, &amp;c. were also given to them for the Lake.II. Belgian Claims and Aspirations.When, upon the occupation of Tabora by the Belgians, the Belgian Government were asked to give General Smuts further military co-operation in completing the conquest of German East Africa, they took the opportunity of defining their view of their position in those districts of German East Africa which had been occupied by. Belgian troops.   That view was as follows : They stated that they were in occupation of the provinces to the north-west of the: German colony, viz., Ruanda, Urundi, part of Bukoba, Ujiji, part of Tabora and of Bismarckburg. These provinces comprise the richest and most populous districts of the colony, a port on Lake Victoria, the larger part of the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, including the old terminus of the Central Railway, and a considerable section of the railway itself. They assumed the right to regard these acquisitions as definitely at their disposal, for the purpose of negotiations, and they valued them roughly at: -1. Two tracts of Portuguese territory, viz., the Kabinda enclave and the Portuguese province on the left bank of the Lower Congo. These tracts were required to secure full control of the mouth of the Congo, and to extend the Atlantic coastline of the Belgian colony.2. An indemnity to cover their military expenditure and the losses resulting to the Belgian Congo in the East African campaign.3. Substantial indemnity for the release of territory and railway, the latter alone being worth, in their opinion, at least ] 70,000,000 francs.4. Certain minor advantages such as concessions in respect of railway rights on the Central Railway, rectification of the frontier of the Belgian Congo in the neighbourhood of Lake Kivu, and such modifications as they might desire for the General Act of the Berlin Conference.This price, or its equivalent, they proposed to exact from Germany at the end of the war. Alternatively, they would continue to hold the districts occupied, or would require the same price from any other Power interested in securing the surrender of the territory. They put forward, as the price of their.!hrther military co-operation with General Smuts, the recognition of their rights over the occupied districts, in the sense described above, and of the existence of the principle that Belgium should reap advan-tages to be defined hereafter for her further participation in the campain in proportion to the measure of her further efforts.In reply to these memoranda, His Majesty&apos;s Government stated that they would dispense with further Belgian co-operation, and they pointed out that the proposal of [408] &quot; I
the Belgian Government to regard the portion of German East Africa occupied by them as definitively theirs (which was implied in the intention expressed by them to make separate arrangements with Germany in regard to terms, if necessary) was contrary to the agreement between the Allies by which all conquered territory was to be held . provisionally only until the end of the war. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree in advance with the recognition of this right, and the)7 regarded it as premature to enter into any discussion as to the future. They could not regard with indifference any settlement in East Africa which might prejudicially affect the safety of their interests in that quarter of the world.The net result of this correspondence with the Belgian Government was 1. That His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to themselves complete freedom of action as regards the settlement to be made after the war.2. That the proposal for further Belgian military co-operation was definitely dropped.*3. That the Belgian Government agreed to hand over the whole of the Tabora district to British Administration during the provisional period of occupa-tion.   This transfer was carried out on the 25th February, 1917.APPENDIX (L).Extract from Memorandum by the India Office.The Portuguese Possessions in India.IT is for consideration whether, if opportunity offers, an attempt should not be made to get rid of the Portuguese settlements also by offering compensation in Africa. These consist of the territories of Goa (1,301 square miles; population in 1900, 475,513), Daman (149 square miles; population, 41,671), and Diu (20 square miles ; population, 14,614). They were acquired in the sixteenth century, and undoubtedly have a great sentimental value&apos; to Portugal, out of whose possession they have never passed. Their economic value is less. The estimated revenue of Goa in 1913-14 was a little over 300,0001., and there was an estimated surplus of 60,000Z. Imports and exports amounted respectively to 560,855Z. and 178,340Z., the overwhelming proportion of the trade being with British India (imports from Portugal, 42,178Z.; exports to Portugal, 268Z.). The number of ships visiting Marmugao during 1914 was 64, of which 29 were British (78,530 tons) and 27 German (79,385 tons).The insecurity which is apt to prevail has occasionally been a source of inconve-nience to neighbouring British territory (e.g., in ] 912); from time to time there are small frontier difficulties, wdiile excise questions give constant trouble. Questions, too, have arisen between the two Governments regarding telegraphs. Thus, in 1912 the Portu-guese Government were negotiating with the German Telefunken Company for the estab-lishment of wireless stations, to which the Government of India expressed themselves as &quot;unable to agree under any circumstances whatever&quot; (telegram of the 20th September, 1912); and it was only after long, protracted negotiations (and, even so, with a condition -attached * which would make British censorship in war time impossible) that the Portuguese Government last month were induced to agree that they would not grant cable landing rights nor authorise the establishment of any wireless telegraph stations without having arrived at a previous understanding with the British Government (Mr. Carnegie, No. 199, of the 24th August, 1916).The Portuguese settlements have not hitherto given serious trouble as asylums for anarchists, though recently there have been cases in which correspondence between such persons seems to have been transmitted through residents in Portuguese territory. If, however, we are successful in eliminating the French settlements, it must be expected that anarchists will find their last refuge in Portuguese soil, while Germany may attempt to find in it a point for political penetration. With Portuguese territorial jurisdiction would presumably disappear also their preposterous ecclesiastical jurisdic-tion, which would in itself be no small advantage to us.   Formerly the Crown of* -The Belgian Government was recently requested to hold in readiness a small force for the local defence of the Rhodesian frontier against raids by fugitive German columns, but was subsequently informed that this co-operation was not, after all, required.
Portugal claimed to exercise patronage and jurisdiction over Roman Catholics throughout British India; and though by a concordat with the Vatican in 1886 these were limited to the metropolitan archbishopric and seven suffragan sees, the anomaly still remains that six Roman Catholic Bishops in British India and native States are nominated by a foreign Government, and British Indian Roman Catholics are constantly memo-rialising, and asking that they may be removed from foreign jurisdiction (the last memorial is as recent as the 18th May last: Sir H. Howard, No 44 of the26th June, 1916). This is the more anomalous in that the Republic of Portugal is violently anti-clerical.APPENDIX (M).Foreign Office Memorandum.The Japanese Claim to Inherit the German Rights in Shantung.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have to consider in the main two issues arising out of this claim, firstly, the desirability, from a British point of view, of Japan acquiring the position hitherto held by Germany in Shantung, and so becoming dominant in this important province of China, and, secondly, the obligation of His Majesty^ Government towards China to prevent the establishment there of Japan as a result of the war.In order to appreciate these two issues it is convenient to examine (II) the original rights of Germany in Shantung, (III) the administration of the province by the Japanese since the fall of Tsingtao, (IV) Japanese policy in respect of Shangtung during the war, (V) the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards this question vis-a-vis China, (VI) the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government vis-a-vis Japan, (VII) the interests of Great Britain, France, and Russia involved, (VIII) the probable attitude of the United States, (IX) the expediency of demanding a quid pro quo, and (X) the propriety of consulting France and Russia beforehand.The recommendations (I) arising out of these considerations are set out first for the purpose of convenience.I. Recommendations.1. Japan is already in occupation of the German rights in Shangtung, and her officials have been administering for two years the leased territory of Kiaochow and the railway from Tsingtao to Tsinahfu. To give her an assurance that we shall support her claims in an eventual settlement is only to recognise the fait accompli. That she would in any circumstances, except before force, evacuate is not thinkable. We have therefore no alternative but to make a virtue of necessity and comply with her request.2. We should, however, in return for our assurance to Japan that we will support her claims in regard to the disposal both of Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung and of her possessions in the Islands North of the Equator, ask from her a corresponding assurance that she will, in the eventual peace settlement, lend us her support in the same spirit in our claims to the German Islands South of the Equator and in our general policy elsewhere.3. Although her intentions, as far as wre know them, are nominally to admit the sovereignty of China throughout Shantung, previous experience leads us to anticipate that she will eventually endeavour to make of it a second Manchuria, which means primarily rejection of the Open Door policy.4. We should be justified in attempting to avert this by attaching to any assurance we may give certain reservations in order to guard ourselves against the Japanese taking over rights in excess of what the Germans possessed.These reservations should be that (a.) Tsingtao shall retain its status as a treaty port, such as Shanghai. (b.) No preferential rates shall be levied over railways already built or to be built hereafter within Shangtung in virtue of rights inherited from the Germans.5. An advantage in insisting on these conditions would be that we should go far to disarm American opposition.
6. Although we are anxious to confine the Japanese to railway construction within Shangtung itself, and in particular to prevent their building a line to connect the Tsingtao-Tsinanfu Railway with the Peking-Hankow Railway, we should be better advised not to raise the point directly, if at all (II).7.&quot; It is inadvisable to ask for a quid pro quo elsewhere, such as might be found in the Yang-tsze valley or Yunnan (IX).8. A declaration might be made that under the changed circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government would no longer consider themselves bound by the assurance given to Germany in 1898 not to construct a railway from Wei-hai Wei into the province of Shantung.   But this is probably unnecessary (VII).9. The two specific reservations recommended are relatively non-contentious. To attach highly controversial conditions to our assurance would be both ungracious and impolitic. We were, indeed, prepared at an inopportune moment to give the assurance primarily, if not solely, in order to obtain quickly naval assistance. But Japan has now spontaneously and unconditionally consented to provide it, though she has intimated that she still expects us to consider favourably, in connection with her concession, her request for an assurance as to her territorial claims. She has at the same time made it clear to us that she is not prepared to help us any further on the sea. Nevertheless, if the transactions no longer retain ostensibly the character of a bargain, Japan&apos;s concession merely anticipates the fulfilment by us of our share: and we cannot allow the consideration of giving her the assurance to be prejudiced. Moreover, the Japanese have rendered both to us and to the Russians considerable service in the supply of guns and munitions, and must continue to do so; and finally,, Germany&apos;s policy of endeavouring to detach Japan from the Alliance has still to be watched and frustrated. Any reply to Japan&apos;s request which could be interpreted as unfavourable to her aspirations would react inevitably on her general attitude.II. German Position in Shantung before the War.This was established by a convention between Germany and China on the 6th March, 1898, and completed by arrangements as to customs in 1905, and as to railway and mineral development in 1913.By the 1898 convention China ceded to Germany on lease territory on both sides of the Bay of Kiaochow, with certain unimportant islands in the bay, and estab-ished a neutral 50 kilometre zone in the surrounding district under the sovereignty of China in which both Chinese and German troops had the right to operate. In practice this neutral zone was German; German subjects were allowed to hold and develop mining property in certain specified areas of Shantung. Preferential treatment was given to Germans in all cases where foreign assistance, in persons, capital, or material, was required. Germany was entitled to coustruct two railways to the boundary of the province.By the later arrangements mentioned the customs came to be administered in the ordinary way by the Chine-e Maritime Customs, though, in fact, the commissioner and most of the employes were all Germans, and the usual 5 per cent, ad valorem duties were levied, and there was no discrimination in favour of Germans, nor were any preferential rates levied along the railways. The Germans waived certain mining rights, acquired under the 1898 convention, and received in return an option on two railways to connect the Tsingtao-Tsinanfu line with the Peking-Hankow and Tien-tsin-Pukow line, and the right to develop important deposits of iron and coal at a specified spot near these railways.N.B. It is very undesirable that the Japanese should inherit the option on the railway. Apart from economic considerations, the linking up of the Tsingtao-Tsinanfu railway with the Peking-Hankow line would give them a strategic advantage of the first importance, enabling them to dominate Peking on the north and the Yang-tsze A^alley in the south. But there is every reason/to suppose that the Japanese intend to build this extension. When, during the negotiations which led to the treaties with China of May 1915, the latter asked, with reference to the German rights to which Japan would succeed, that the phrase, &quot;in .relation to Shantung&quot; should be altered to read &quot;in Shantung,&quot; the effect of which would have been to exclude the German concessions for the railway extensions in question, the Japanese Government refused. Should it he decided, however, to make the reservations recorn-mended in I 4, reservation (b) could be so worded, or at least the conditions so framed, as to recognise Japanese rights to build railways within Shantung only.   The
utmost that we could do would be to show the Japanese by implication that we wish their railways to stop at the boundary of the province.In general there has been under the German regime a virtual monopoly of industrial concessions, but as regards the retail trade and freights the Open Door has been maintained. In Manchuria there is general preferential treatment for Japanese goods.There is another partial German asset which ought possibly to be borne in mind in any discussion that may arise, viz., the northern half of the Tien-tsin-Pukow Railway which is German built and German controlled. (The southern half is British built and British controlled.) The German section lies within the province of Shantung wdth the exception of a short northern section which runs through Chihli to Tien-tsin.The Japanese may demand the section which runs wholly through the province of Shangtung. They may also demand the extreme northern section, and they may even ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to surrender to them the southern British section for the sake of uniformity.It must, however, be&quot; understood that this railway in no sense falls within the category of German rights acquired under the Convention of 1898 and subsequent arrangements, but it is a Chinese Government railway, and therefore on an entirely different basis to that of any other of the Shantung railways.It may be that the Japanese will not raise the question, and in any case it is important that it should not be mentioned to them.III. The Existing Japanese Administration of Shantung.The Japanese officials replaced Germans in the administration of Tsingtao and the railway after the fall of the Port. But towards the end of 1915 the Chinese customs were re-established, though the employees of the Chinese customs service were Japanese. No discrimination is made at present in favour of Japanese goods, and the ordinary 5 per cent, ad valorem tariff is levied. But trade was suspended during the military operations and has hardly yet been resumed. There is a Japanese garrison at Tsinanfu and at other places on the railway.IV. Japanese Policy in Respect of Shantung during the War.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo was told by Baron Kato on the 10th August, 1914, that the Japanese were preparing an attack on Tsingtao, that they desired no territorial aggrandisement in that region, but that they would be in a position eventually to restore to China the territory from which the German occupation had excluded her. Nevertheless the note of the Japanese Government embodying this omitted all reference to the return of Tsingtao to the Chinese, and the Japanese Government refused to join His Majesty&apos;s Government in a declaration to the Chinese Government that Tsingtao would be returned.Still the Japanese ultimatum to Germany of the 16th August required her &quot; to deliver on a date not later than the 15th September to the Imperial Japanese authorities without condition or compensation the entire leased territories of Kiaochow with a view to eventual restoration of the same to China.&quot;But almost simultaneously Baron Kato fold Sir C. Greene that the terms on which Japan would restore Kiaochow to China must depend on whether the place was surrendered without bloodshed or had to be taken after heavy expenditure of life and money.The Chinese, however, maintained throughout that they had received definite and formal assurances from Japan that Kiaochow would be restored to China, and that Japan associated England with her in the attainment of that object. It was on the strength of these assurances, which, as far as we know, were never given in writing, that the Chinese allowed the violation of their territory for the purpose of the military operations for the capture of Tsingtao.The real, intentions of the Japanese Government appear to have been first indicated on the 18th December, when Baron Kato stated in the Japanese Parliament that the Japanese Government had entered into no agreement with any American or European country or with China as the result of which Japan was compelled to restore Kiaochow to China, and he added later that the whole position had been altered by the fact that Japan had been obliged to capture it by force of arms.It was not, however, till May 1915 that the Japanese definitely showed their hand. A series of demands were made on China, and those relating to the proposed [408] k *
future status of Shantung were embodied in treaties and exchanges of notes. Briefly stated they are as follows : The Chinese Government agree to give full assent to all matters upon which the Japanese Government may hereafter agree with the German Government relating to the disposition of all rights, interests, and concessions which Germany, by virtue of treaties or otherwise, possesses in relation to the province of Shantung.The Japanese Government undertake to restore to China after the war the leased territory of Kiaochow Bay on the following conditions : (I.) The whole of Kiaochow Bay to be opened as a commercial port.(2.) A concession, under the exclusive jurisdiction of Japan, to be established at aplace designated by the Japanese Government. - (3.) If the foreign Bowers desire it, an international concession may be established. (4.) The Japanese and Chinese Governments shall arrange by mutual agreementthe disposal of the German properties and buildings.The Chinese took note of this declaration and made no protest.The ultimate effect of this arrangement cannot be gauged now. It may mean little or much. On the face of it China regains sovereignty over Kiaochow, but the establishment of a Japanese concession in the commercial quarter of Tsingtao will tend gradually to close the Open Door. Her immediate object may be only to control Shantung economically, and the province will be of great economic value to her. In addition to- developing a market for her home manufactures, she will acquire control over areas where she can obtain at low priees the raw materials of those manufactures. Shantung is essentially a coal and cotton province commodities which are invaluable to Japanese factories. But the inheritance by Japan of the German railways and the option on extensions may also be used to give her a predominant political and military position in the province and constitute a strategic menace to Peking and the Yang-tsze.Japan&apos;s immediate intention seems to be to save China&apos;s face. But, though the latter unwisely protested immediately after the fall of Tsingtao and asked for the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, she has by submitting to the treaties and taking note, without protest, of the Japanese declaration, accepted the inevitable. On paper she will be no worse off-in fact, less badly off- by the subsitution of the Japanese for the German arrangement, but actually the Japanese penetration is potentially more dangerous to her than the German, and China will never believe that Japan is not going to convert Shantung into a second Manchuria.V. The Position of His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government vis-a-vis China.When rumours of an impending attack on Tsingtao reached Peking on the 12th August, 1914, and the President thereupon expressed anxiety with regard to Chinese interests, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking stated under instructions (founded on Baron Kato&apos;s original statement to Sir C. Greene (IV) ), that the Chinese need have no appre-hension as to the residts of any joint action by the British and Japanese Governments. On the 12th August Sir J. Jordan telegraphed his opinion that a clear declaration should be made to the effect that Tsingtao would eventually be restored to China. Sir John was instructed, in reply, to try and induce his Japanese colleague to join him in making a declaration to.this effect, but his efforts in this direction were unsuccessful, as were those made subsequently.It may be argued from this that His Majesty&apos;s Government are under a certain moral obligation towards China to see that Kiaochow is restored to her, but, in view of the fact related (IV) that China made no protest against the arrangement after-wards forced on her by Japan, His Majesty&apos;s Government may perhaps be taken to be released from such obligation. It may be taken for granted that in agreeing over the head of China to Japan&apos;s succession to Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung Great Britain will prejudice her traditional relations with China, forfeit to a considerable degree the confidence of the Chinese in her protection, and lose prestige by a demonstration of helplessness.There is, however, no choice in the matter, and we can only hope that, when the war is over we shall sufficiently regain our strength in the Par East to be able to check Japanese ambitions elsewhere in China, and so get back what we have temporarily lost of Chinese confidence.
81VI.__The Position of His Majesty&apos;s Government vis-a-vis Japan.The Japanese Government claim that on the 9th August, 1914, Sir E. Grey, speaking to the Japanese Ambassador said that in the event of Japan&apos;s declaring war asainst Germany and capturing Kiaochow, Great Britain had no objection to Japan&apos;s continuing in possession of that territory after the war, and that he desired the Imperial Government to have no misgiving, on that point.There is no record of this conversation and Sir E. Grey would appear to have been misinterpreted, since such a declaration of policy as he is reported to have made would be inconsistent with the instructions sent almost simultaneously to Sir J. Jordan (V).&apos;It is, however, true that on the 9th March, 1915, Sir E. Grey informed the Counsellor of the Japanese Embassy, in connection with the Japanese demands on China, that he recognised that there must be an expansion of Japanese interests and influence in China, on the same lines as there has been of other Powers and that Japan naturally expected to see them increased.In January 1915 certain overtures were made by Germany to Japan, by which the German concessions at Tien-tsin and Hankow were offered to Japan. On the 31st January Sir E. Grey informed the Japanese Ambassador that we ourselves did not intend to put forward claims to any of the German concessions in China, and that therefore, if the future of those concessions came to be discussed with the Chinese Government, the discussion could not be a source of difficulty between Japan and ourselves. Later, on the 4th February, Sir E. Grey explained that he meant that His Majesty&apos;? Government would raise no objection to these concessions being the subject of negotiation between Japan and China. But the German &quot; concessions&quot; in question were the German settlements in China generally, and, though the Japanese pretend that the effect of Sir E. Grey&apos;s statement was in some way to refer to Shantung, the incident was really irrelevant to that question.VII. The Interests of Great Britain, Russia, and France involved. There is no British political interest in Shantung.On the 10th April, 1898, when His Majesty&apos;s Government obtained the refusal of Wei-hai Wei on the departure of the Japanese, they gave an assurance to the German Government that England had no intention of contesting the rights and interests of Germany in Shantung, and that she would not construct a railway from Wei-hai Wei into the interior of Shantung. It was explained to Germany at the same time that this question must, however, be kept distinct from that of the German claims with regard to railway construction in the province.British commercial interests in Shantung are not large. There is a small amount of retail trade (soap, cigarettes, soda ash) which is centred in Tsinanfu and the purchase for export of pongee, strawbraid, oil seeds, &amp;c. The export trade is chiefly at Chefu and Tsinanfu.The British American Tobacco Company, the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Lever, Brunner, Mond, &amp;c, are represented at Tsinanfu.Russian and French interests are comparatively insignificant, both politically and commercially.The Russian Government has declared : &quot; qu&apos;il n&apos;a nullement en vue d&apos;empieter sur les droits japonais en Chine ou leser les interets du Japon en creant des obstacles a leur developpement ulterieur.&quot;Moreover, it is unlikely, in view of the treaty signed between Japan and Russia on the 3rd July, 1916, that the latter will in any way try to obstruct Japanese expansion in China.VIII. The Attitude of America.The following identic note was ,sent by the United States in May 1915 to China and Japan : &quot; In view of the circumstances of the negotiations which have taken place and which are now pending between the Government of China and the Govern-ment of Japan, and of the agreements which have been reached as a result
thereof, the Government of the United. States has the honour to notify the Government of the Chinese Republic that it cannot recognise any agreements or undertakings which have been entered into, or which may be entered into, between the Government of China and Japan, impairing the treaty rights of the United States and its citizens in China, the political or territorial integrity of the Republic of China, or the international policy relative to China, commonly known as the Open Door policy. An identical note has been transmitted to the Japanese Government.&quot;On the 16th March, 1916, the American Ambassador in London told Sir E. Grey that His Government had been receiving information that the design of Japan was to secure a predominant position in China, and reserve to herself at any rate the exploitation of certain provinces. Mr. Page said that the attitude of the United States Government now, as hitherto, would be opposed to such exploitation.Mr. Lansing had a conversation on the 16th January tins year with Sir C. Spring-Rice, in which he said that he was anxious about the attitude assumed by Japan, wrho seemed to be asserting rights in China and in particular in Shantung which could not be admitted by the United States.He subsequently stated that the United States Government could not acquiesce in any form of financial control in China, except, perhaps, in Manchuria.For many months the American press has been very apprehensive as to Japan&apos;s inheriting the German rights in Shantung, and acquiring the German Islands north of the Equator, and there will evidently be considerable excitement when it is known that we have formally agreed to support Japan in her claims.If it is decided to attach the suggested reservations to our assurance, it is for consideration whether we should inform the United States Government confidentially, as the United States is an interested party.We have heard privately that Mr. Wilson intends, at the end of the war, to call a Conference of the Powers interested in. China, and to endeavour to * come to an agreement for the maintenance of Chinese integrity, and the policy of the Open Door.   But we have no official confirmation of this.IX. The Expediency of obtaining a Quid Pro Quo Elsewhere.Japan has certain definite assets, and very considerable trade in the Yang-tsze Valley. There are the important iron and coal mines, known as the Han-Yeh-Ping; there is a Japanese option on a railway to connect the Japanese line in Fukien with Hankow; and there are certain Japanese claims on the mines in Kiangsi. Moreover, Japanese shipping companies have wharves at all the ports. It is certain that Japan would never consent to surrender any of these assets, and we should only irritate her by suggesting it. We might conceivably hint that we should view with approval the withdrawal from Hankow of the unnecessary Japanese garrison that has been there for many years, but even this would undoubtedly give offence.As regards Yunnan, where Japanese activities are viewed with alarm by the Indian Government, and are undoubtedly disquieting, a request for their cessation would probably be met by their disavowal, or a statement that the Japanese Govern-ment had no official cognisance of them. The utmost that we could ask would be a declaration that Japan disinterested herself in the provinces adjoining India and Tibet. But this might lead to her interesting herself elsewhere, and in any case raise issues leading to a protracted controversy. It may also be taken into account that Japan&apos;s resources are limited, and though the domination of Shantung by Japan is to be deplored politically, and its eventual conversion into a second Manchuria to be feared economically, her energy will thereby be diverted from those parts of China which are of greater importance to us, and we shall be given breathing space, if only that, for the unimpeded development of our own interests in the Yang-tsze Valley, Quangtun?, and Yunnan.X. The Propriety of Considting Russia and France.The Japanese Government propose to obtain an assurance from us that we will support their claim and then themselves to approach the French and Russian Govern-ments with a similar request.
The agreed procedure being for all the Allied Governments to consult in common before deciding on prospective peace terms, the French and Russian Governments would presumably be entitled to object to the procedure now proposed by the Japanese Government. But it has been generally recognised that the Anglo-Japapese Alliance permits a certain exceptional handling of international matters in the Far East, and the practice of Great Britain and Japan engaging in preliminary negotiations or conversations about matters involving their Far Eastern interests has hitherto gone unchallenged.If it is decided to give the required assurance to the Japanese Government, it would no doubt be given &quot; subject to an agreement being arrived at between the Japanese Government and the other Allied Governments.&quot;J.
