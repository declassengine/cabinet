Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET.G.-142,  hi.IN October 1916 my predecessor, Mr. Balfour, circulated some questions about Heligoland to certain naval officers of distinction, serving at the Admiralty and afloat, and invited their opinions.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet, the questions and the replies.E. C.Admiralty, April 5, 1917.QUESTIONS ON HELIGOLAND.Though nobody can foresee with any assurance either the date at which peace will be declared, or the circumstances under which its terms will be considered by the Powers, it seems desirable that careful consideration should be given to the various problems on which the country may have to forrn an opinion. Some of these problems, though territorial in appearance, are naval in fact, and among these not the least important are the questions connected with Heligoland.The man in the street-whether the street be in London or Berlin undoubtedly holds the view that the possession of Heligoland has been a great naval strength to Germany, and that whether, under the then existing conditions, Great Britain was right or wrong to cede it under the settlement made in 1890, modern developments both in sea power and air power have proved that she made a very bad bargain.It is, however, clear, from such informal conversations as I have had on this subject with high naval authorities, that this is not the unanimous view of the Navy, perhaps is not its view at all. In order to clear the matter up I have drawn out a series of questions whose answers may provide a solid foundation for any. decision which the country may be called upon to take : I. Does the possession of Heligoland by Germany help the German Fleet ?(a.) Does it materially increase our difficulties in carrying out*hostile operations in the Bight either by (1) surface craft, (2) submarines, (-3) aircraft ? - (6.) If so, is this result due to the fact that he&amp;vy guns are mounted upon the island; or that it provides an important post of observation connected both with the land and sea by wireless ? or that its harbour materially aids the work of German submarines, mine-layers, and destroyers ? (c.) Does it hamper our blockade ?(d.) Does it facilitate the movements of the High Seas Fleet?II. 1. Would the possession of Heligoland by Britain help the British Fleet? (a.) What garrison would it require in time, of peace to secure it against a coup demain; and with what armaments must it .be provided to make it safe anduseful in time of war ? (6.) If it is to be treated as a fortress, could we tolerate the German populationon its shores, or, indeed, any population not directly required for the serviceof the garrison ?(c.) How far would the necessity of providing reliefs to the garrison, and of supplying food and munitions, hamper^ us during hostilities? Would it interfere with our naval freedom of action ? Would it involve important risks either to our warships or our transports ?(d.) Would the possession of the island help us to menace, by submarines or mines, the German Fleet either issuing from the Bight, or returning through it ? [472] ^ ^ ^        B
(e.) Would an air station on the island prove a valuable source of information with regard to the movements of the High Seas Fleet ? and(/.) Would it constitute a serious menace to German naval bases and the Kiel Canal ?2. If, as is probable, the answers to these questions do not all point in the same direction, how does the balance of advantage and disadvantage lie ? In other words, putting all questions of sentiment on one side, should we gain or lose as a naval Power by possessing Heligoland (a.) Ungarrisoned and unfortified ?(b.) As a subsidiary naval station fortified and garrisoned so as to be secure against attack both at the outbreak of war and during its continuance ? It must be noted that in answering this last question the subject of cost must be taken seriously into account.A. J. B.September 16, 1916.REPLIES.(1.)Reply from Admiral Sir John Jellieoe (Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet).My dear Mr. Balfour, &quot; Iron Duke,&quot; October 10, 1916.I enclose a paper on the questions you ask me regarding the possession of Heligoland.The point in the paper that I should like to emphasise is, that the possession of a fortified Heligoland would be to us a great incubus and drag on the fleet, exposing the fleet(to great risks with no commensurate advantage, unless the fortified Heligoland is entirely self-supporting and in no way dependent on the fleet.Yours very sincerely,J. R. JELLICOE.Taking the questions raised in the attached paper seriatim the following are the replies:  I. Yes, as an outpost for aircraft, submarines, and destroyers, its utility is greatly reduced by the circle of minefields, which extend 30 miles to seaward of it. These prevent the approach of surface craft. The gun defences of Heligoland are therefore of little, if any, value to the Germans.(a.)   1. No, the minefields do this. 2. Not all.3. No experience, but its position is favourable to cover the German rivers from air attacks from seaward. (b.) As a fortress and observation post, it is of little use.   It is of use as anadvanced base for submarines, destroyers, aircraft, and minesweepers, (c.) Not at all.(d.) Only as an advanced base for destroyers and minesweepers, the former protecting German minefields, and the latter ensuring a safe passage through minefields laid by us.II.  The possession of Heligoland would be a great misfortune to the British Fleet unless it is absolutely and entirely self-supporting. It would necessitate the constant presence of surface craft of all types to convoy stores and munitions, the losses among which should be heavier than the losses they could inflict on the enemy, because the enemy&apos;s primary bases are within 30 miles, and, lying round it in the form of a semi-circle, command all approaches to it.(a.) I cannot express an opinion. It depends on the feasible landing places. It could not be held in war if dependent on Great Britain for supplies of any sort, as mines and submarines would prevent approach to it.(6.) No.
(c.) If any dependence were placed.on supplies from Great Britain the possession of Heligoland by us would very seriously interfere with naval freedom of action, and it would be a very great incubus to the Navy, involving serious losses without sufficient, compensating advantages.(d.) Yes, very greatly, provided it could be held without support from Great Britain.(e.) Yes, provided the air defences of the Island were strong enough to deal with the aircraft of the enemy, and the aircraft were in bomb-proof shelters, otherwise our aeroplanes would be in the position of an inferior fleet contesting the command of the sea. I should not recommend the basing of Zeppelins on the Island.(/.)   Yes.   See (d.) and (e.).The case of Gallipoli will assist in appreciating the Heligoland case.At Gallipoli we held undisputed surface command of the sea; the distances were small, yet a few submarines deprived us of several battleships, and reduced us to communicating at night, and by trawlers, tugs, and, other small craft. We should never be as favourably placed as regards supply to Heligoland as we were at Gallipoli. .It is sometimes contended that the possession of Heligoland would seal up the German bases and forbid the exit of submarines, &amp;c. This cannot be, because the submarines and other craft can safely leave by the Kattegat : and the case of Zeebrugge shows that it is very difficult to seal up a port.The history of the cruises of the German submarine U. 0 5 shows that in spite of our mines, nets, &amp;c, she left regularly at will, and on practically any course, and returned safely. Many other submarine mine-layers probably did the same, and destroj^ers safely use Zeebrugge as a base. It is 60 miles, only from Dover, where we can without hindrance collect any ships and material we wish. Zeebrugge is also open to bombardment from the sea.Heligoland would have less power to dominate the German bases than have Dover and Harwich over Zeebrugge.&apos;2.: (a.) We should gain considerably during war, because the island would not be a garrisoned and armed enemy base.(b.) It would be a millstone round the neck of the Navy, and an attempt to hold it would lead to heavy losses from mine and submarine. The case is different if it were absolutely self-supporting. In this event, the question of cost must be weighed against the advantages to be gained.Summing Up. There are two conditions under which the possession of Heligoland would be advantageous to us.Firstly, if the island were fortified to an extent which would make it impregnable against German sea and air attack, and if it were entirely self-supporting and independent of being provisioned or munitioned, or of communication in any way with Great Britain during, say, twelve months of war, and provided bomb-proof harbours were constructed in which submarines and aeroplanes could shelter.There is no doubt that our possession of Heligoland as a submarine base would prove a great thorn in the side of the Germany Navy, and a very serious menace to the exit of their fleet from the North Sea ports. Unless it is absolutely self-supporting it would, on the other hand, be nothing but an incubus to the British Navy, and would involve our surface ships running risks which would be out of all proportion to any possible advantage to be gained by the possession of the island.Secondly, the possession of Heligoland by this country as an unfortified island, which would be given up at once at the outbreak of war, would give the advantage that the Germans could not make it into an advanced base. This, of course, would involve the destruction of all the works now existent in Heligoland.J. R. JELLICOE.&quot; Iron Duke,&quot; October 10, 1916.
In formulating the answers to the various questions on the subject of Heligoland, 1 have followed the series of questions as put, this being the clearest and most concise method of dealing with them.   But I preface the answers with the following remarks.The problem of Heligoland is a factor of Imperial strategy and not alone a naval factor.It is assumed that, when the time comes for considering the terms of peace, Germany will be so reduced in strength that she will probably be in no condition to force a European war for at least a generation.The answers to the questions under heading I (Does the possession of Heligoland by Germany help the German Fleet ?) are beyond doubt, and they point emphatically to the decision that it is imperative Heligoland should no longer remain a German possession.The answers to those under heading II (Would the possession of Heligoland by Britain help the British Fleet?) assume that the situation would be firmly grasped, for half-measures would be useless, and it appears necessary that Heligoland should constitute a complete fortress in all respects at all times. Properly fortified and stored, it should be constantly on a war footing, which would preclude the possibility of its containing any civil population.As regards the final questions, there is no divergence as to the direction in which the answers point. Obviously, ungarrisoned and unfortified, Heligoland would only remain in our possession just so long as we were at peace with Germany. In view of the future development of the Air Service, the advantages accruing to the possession of Heligoland are immense, For air strategy in future wars will undoubtedly become of increasing&apos; importance.Generally, I have confined the answers to the purely naval side of the question. I assume that the question under II (a) can be answered satisfactorily by competent military authority, and that there is no reason to suppose that, properly fortified and garrisoned, it could not be maintained against any attack from the sea, more especially when possessed by the Power that holds the command of the sea.October 14, 1916.The fourteen specified questions may be answered as follows :  I. Yes ; for the reasons given below.(a.) Yes; Heligoland represents a fortress at the point of a salient, which renders the salient almost unapproachable.(i.) Surface craft are hampered in their approach and retreat by a gun-swept circle of. 20 miles diameter, which half fills the navigable waters of the Bight.Reply from Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty (Commanding Battle Cruiser Fleet.)Dear Mr. Balfour, EMS. &quot;Lion,&quot; October 14, 1916.Your letter, with Heligoland Paper, dated September was only received by me on my return here on the 8th October. I attach some remarks and answers to the questions. It is a complex matter, difficult to solve by question and answer, and needs consideration&quot;in conjunction with others who can voice authoritatively the answers to the multitude of further questions which crop up as one probes the main question. I hope my answers will be of value.The crux of the question lies in the answer to Question II (a). I cannot conceive Germany reconciling herself to our fortifying and garrisoning Heligoland. Much must depend upon her condition when peace reigns once more.It will be to her what Gibraltar is to Spain, and she, if she had not become a. decadent race, would have fought us over and over again for its possession. Will Germany be so reduced ?Yours sincerely&apos;,DAVID BEATTY.
(ii.) Submarines trying to operate in the Bight have a powerful German air station immediately alongside them. E.C. mines can be controlled from the fortress, and more distant mine-fields kept under effective observation. German submarines, aeroplanes, and torpedo-boats can be kept at Heligoland ready for instant attack, in the very centre of the area where our submarines require to work.(iii.) Aircraft are never used by us in the Bight except when taken there by surface craft; they therefore suffer the limitations under heading (a) (i). Also, any British aircraft which might try to work up the Bight can be sure of having a superior air force launched from Heligoland across their line of retreat.(b.) This is partly answered above. To sum up, the value of Heligoland is based on all these properties and on others as well. It is a fortress with heavy guns of great range; it is a powerful air base both for observation and attack; its situation is ideal; it forms an advanced base for submarines and torpedo craft; and it is the nerve centre of extensive mine-fields.(c.) The Germans in Heligoland do not greatly hamper our blockade if we compare with the case where Heligoland is either non-existant, or neutral, for in such case we should find a close blockade in the Bight very difficult. But if we consider the only rational alternative, Heligoland in our possession, it would immensely help us to prevent merchant shipping entering Hamburg and the Kiel Canal.Hence in a negative sense it hampers our blockade.(d.y Heligoland greatly aids the movements of the High Sea Fleet: as a fortress to cover its retirement, as an outpost to protect it while exercising or doing gunnery practices to the eastward, as a base for sweepers to clear passages for its egress, and as a base for aircraft to observe and scout in advance of it.To sum up then, the value of Heligoland to Germany is very great.II. (i.) Heligoland in our hands would be of enormous importance, not merely for purposes of naval strategy, but more particularly when we look to the requirements of air strategy in the immediate future.(i.) (a.) This question must be answered by Military Officers. The fortress, however, should be maintained permanently on a war footing.(&amp;.) No civil population could be tolerated.(c.) A weak oversea force which requires a &quot;line of communication&quot; kept open for it may be a source of great embarrassment, but a self-contained fortress, such as Gibraltar or Heligoland should be, would cause no such trouble. The island could easily stow food and munitions for twelve months, but a supply steamer to be passed in by night, say once a month, would present no difficulty which could not be overcome. Even with Heligoland in enemy possession we have been able to send, periodicallv, minelayers by night to within one hour&apos;s steaming of the fortress.Only mines could keep the supply ship out, and we have now many effective methods of dealing with mine-fields. Spare planes, airships and their crews would, of course, fly there whenever required.(d.) Yes ; submarines, minelayers, torpedo craft, and aircraft working from such a base might be of incalculable value. Consider how the Germans at Zeebrugge,. with an ill-equipped port at a greater distance, have strewed our coasts with wrecks and have constantly blocked the mouth of the Thames. We also, from Heligoland, could do this to Hamburg, Wilhehnshaven, and the Kiel Canal.(e.) Yes, we could observe the exact state of the High Sea Fleet every morning and would reap oilier great advantages as well.(/.) Heligoland as an air base would hold a unique and dominating position in air strategy.   AH the following places can be reached in an hour or less : KielHam burg .. Lister Deep Borkum   .. Schillig Roads Ouxhaven . .Wilhelmshaveu SyltMiles.80805050303540 40-50A three hours&apos; journey for plane or airship will reach Essen (160 miles), four hours to Berlin (220 miles), five hours to the Austrian frontier (280 miles).   These distances [472] c
are nothing to an airship, and have been done frequently by planes during the present war.If we had Heligoland now we could communicate freely by air with our own and Russian ships in the Baltic. Also from this base we can cover large areas of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland.Whether we look at it commercially in peace, or strategically in war, Heligoland forms an outpost of such importance that it may justly be called the Gibraltar of Northern Europe.2. The above answers point very emphatically in one direction. The only difficulty we have to face is some anxiety as to its security, which is not insurmountable.(a.) To keep Heligoland unfortified is to go less than half-way to our proper objective.(b.) Fortified and garrisoned and in our hands, Heligoland may well be looked on by future generations as the key of Northern Europe.Fifty years hence we may be fighting Russia : in matters such as these we must think in centuries. As regards cost, more than half the work is already done for us and what remains can be comfortably spread over the next generation, for war with Germany should not recur within that period.DAVID BEATTY.October 14, 1916.(3.)Reply from Admiral Sir Henry Jackson (First Sea Lord).Remarks on the use of Heligoland.I am not in full agreement with those critics who deplore our want of foresight in having ceded Heligoland to Germany on any terms.The possession of this island by Great Britain at the outbreak of war would have entailed us attempting to hold it, and probably caused us many naval losses, unless we had abandoned it to the enemy forthwith.In the main strategy of the war to which we have been forced to conform, the use of Heligoland has been almost negligible as far as.Jt has affected major naval operations, but in a future war against the holders of the estuaries of the rivers flowing into the Heligoland Bight the main strategy might be entirely different, and it is possible that this small island might prove of great strategical value.In the present war it has hitherto only affected minor naval operations, and has benefitted the enemy b)r enabling him to maintain an efficient patrol of the German bight by forces weaker both numerically and offensively than would have been possible had the island not existed or been held by ourselves or a neutral.To answer your questions categorically, it may be stated: I. (a.) 1. It greatly increases the danger to our surface craft penetrating the Bight. Its position as a strongly fortified look-out station 25 miles from the enemy territory and war channels bars access to the inner waters, except through comparatively narrow channels which can be easily guarded with small forces.2. Its effect on submarines, however, is much less, and its position is in some respects an assistance in enabling them to fix their positions in the Bight much more readily than they could do in its absence.3. The same remark applies to aircraft, but at the same time if they are sighted on the island the news of their presence can be communicated to the fleet and defending forces by telegraph easier and earlier than could otherwise be the case.(b.) This result is due to the guns of its defence keeping all surface, craft at a distance from its shores which, depends on the visibility at. the time, and may range from 1 to 15 miles. - - -It can signal-their approach by&apos;telegraph so that the force approaching will not know whether its presence has been made known or not.Its harbour forms an anchorage for the outpost flotilla of the day, and brings them two hours nearer the North Sea than if they were at anchor at their bases in the rivers. It is not considered it is of much use for minelayers, except as a convenient outport.(c.) It does not affect our blockading force in the Atlantic Ocean in the present condition in this war.
(d.) Yes, in so far as it prevents our vessels penetrating into the Bight, and its presence forms a fortified barrier under which the vessels of the High Sea Fleet can shelter if for any cause they cannot enter the rivers. A retreating squadron would obtain support about 25 miles nearer the North Sea than it could from the batteries on the inner islands or mainland.II. 1. (a. i If we possessed Heligoland we should be able to watch and report the exit of the German Fleet from its bases with much greater facility than at present, but this would entail a watching force being based on the island.The garrison would have to be a large one, probably reaching 5,000 men, and the maintenance of this garrison and the naval forces based on the island would necessitate maintaining an intermittent line of communication to the island from our shores.The forts and vessels would be subject to frequent attack and also steady attrition, and would constitute a severe drain on our resources, inadequate with the return.(b.) A German population could not be tolerated, and in a period of strained relations, all persons not required as part of the garrison would have to be removed.(c.) The maintenance of the garrison would, as stated in (a), be a severe drain on our resources, but would not necessarily interfere with our naval operations elsewhere. All vessels approaching Heligoland would be subject to attack, and the risks to them would always be very serious.(d.) If we could maintain the island and adequately protect the stores from bombardment, we should be able to hamper the movements of the German Fleet more readily than we can do at present, but probably at a greater expense as a whole.(e.) An air station would certainly be of value, and a natural addition to the forces on the island if we possessed it.if.) Its possession would not actually be a serious menace to the German naval bases, as long as the German Fleet was intact. With no fleet in being, it would bring our base of observation 300 miles nearer the German coast. It would be a thorn in the side of the enemy, and a very great anxiety to us. It would form a submarine base difficult for us to maintain, and may be compared with the Belgian ports in the present war, which are a nuisance to us but do not prevent our freedom of action.2. (a.) Heligoland ungarrisoned and unfortified would be at the mercy of Germany, who would seize it and refortify it in a few months.(6.) Fortified as a base, its expense both in money, material, and personnel would not get an adequate return for the reasons given-above,----H. B. J.October 1, 1916.- ; (4.)Reply from Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Wilson.Answer to First Lord&apos;s Questions on Heligoland.I. The possession of Heligoland is of great assistance to the German Fleet.It is useful as a post of observation in itself, and it also provides a place of safety where the enemy&apos;s outpost vessels can find shelter under its guns if attacked by a superior force.Submarines can also be kept there ready to attack any of our vessels which attempt to operate in the Bight.It is not used for aircraft, as far as we know.The submarines would probably be able to prevent us from keeping a close blockade, even if Heligoland did not exist, but the possession of Heligoland makes it easier for them to do so. -It facilitates the movements of the High Seas Fleet by making it more difficult for us to watch the exits from the Jade and Weser.. II-The possession of Heligoland, if we could hold it, would be of considerable assistance to us 1. As a post of observation.2. As an aircraft station from which the movements of the German vessels in theElbe and Weser could be watched. 3. As a base where our submarines and destroyers could re-fuel and carry outsmall refits.
It is doubtful, however, if, even with Heligoland in our possession, we could keep destroyers in the Bight, as they would always be liable to be cut off by a superior force.It is also very doubtful if any garrison could hold Heligoland if the Germans decided to take it, The total area of the island is so small that it would be hardly possible to give it a larger number .of guns and howitzers than it has at present. The island would be always under the observation of the Germans from the three-mile limit and -from the air, so that every important change in the armament would be known to them, and they would be sure to make special arrangements for bombarding it by mounting long-range guns in monitors or otherwise. These could choose their own time for attack as we could not keep our fleet in the neighbourhood for fear of submarines.The monitors would be liable to attack by our submarines, but as they would only have to go a few miles from their base they would no doubt find effective means of protecting themselves against torpedoes.The island would also be continuously exposed to attack from the air.All our supply ships would be exposed to attack by submarines, and it would be difficult to give them adequate protection.Our attempts to support the garrison hy naval means would probably result in our losing many vessels by submarines and mines, and gradually weakening our force in that way without adequate advantage.If we took it, it would have to be treated only as .a fortress, and everyone in the island would have to be under military or naval discipline.On the whole, quite apart from the fact that in -our hands it would be a constant source of irritation to the Germans, the balance of advantages and disadvantages is very much against taking possession of it.The dismantling of it as a fortress might be considered in connection with an scheme for neutralising the Kiel -Canal under International Guarantee, but in that case Cuxhaven would have to be dismantled also and the forts at Kiel as well.   There would be little advantage in having it in our possession unfortified as we could not then prevent the Germans from taking possession of it and fortifying it in case of war.A. K. W.October 5, 1916.(5.)Reply from Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe (Second Sea Lord).Questions on Heligoland. Dear Mr. Balfour, October 25, 1916.I have answered your questions seriatim to avoid confusion : &apos;   I-(a.)-(1.) Yes.        ;  .(2.) Not materially. -(3.) Not materially. (6.) Yes.   All three.(c.) No.   Not materially from the point of view of modern blockade.&apos; (d.) Yes, as an outpost.   It enables them to start closer to the North Sea.   It shelters a fleet falling back.II. (1.) (a.) In peace, about 5,000 men ; in war, very heavy armanent at a very great expenditure.     Very costly line of communication; and it is too small for a main base, (b.) No.(c.) (1.) An appreciable drain on our resources. &apos;    (2.) No.(3.) Yes. (d.) Yes. (e.) Yes. .(/.) A menace certainly; how serious depends on many factors.II. (2.) (a.) Yes, in the early stage of a war.   Probably only for a short time. (b.) Probably lose more than we should gain.
To sum up : Heligoland is too small to be made a Gibraltar. We might hold it for a term of years, say five, or till the war indemnity was paid, if one was contemplated. It might then be ceded back, dismantled, with a proviso that it was neither to be fortified nor garrisoned. This would make it less effective during the first stage (only) of a future war.In my opinion, it would not pay us to hold it permanently both garrisoned and fortified. &quot; It would cost us more than we should gain by it.A. G.-C.(6.)Reply from Rear-Admiral Tudor (Third Sea Lord).The replies I should feel inclined to give to the questions you put are as follows: I. (a.) and (b.) 1. Yes. Our surface craft must keep ourside its gun range ; its harbour affords shelter to submarines and other craft, gives protection to minesweepers, and is an outpost for information. It therefore counters our surface craft from all these points of view.2. Yes, to a certain extent.3. Only in so far that it is a potential menace to vessels carrying aircraft, (c.) It prevents us from having a blockade..(d.) Yes, in so far as it hinders our observation and reduces the area in which we can act free! v.II. I. Yes.(a.) I doubt if a garrison exceeding 2,000 to 3,000 men would be necessary, provided a submarine flotilla were based on its harbour.A moderate number of long-range guns combined with submarines and other torpedo craft should make its capture by a eoup de main difficult.(b.) It&apos;would be wise to clear the Germans out; otherwise it might be open to our own nationals.(c.) Reliefs, food, and munitions should provide little difficulty if our fleet be superior.(d). Yes, it would be a constant menace to their fleet coming out if used as a submarine base.(e.) Yes, certainly.(/.) It would form, an advanced base for on attack on German naval bases and the canal.2.-(a.) Yes.(b.) Yes, and not at great cost.I am sorry that Heligoland, fortified Or unfortified, did not belong to us when this war broke out, because it would have entailed two things, both to the disadvantage of the Germans.We should have had submarines in the harbour, so that Germany must have suffered losses to take it; and when taken she would have had to undertake its fortification under difficulties, instead of everything being ready for her.One of our greatest troubles has been that we have had so little to attack, but with Heligoland in our possession, and fortified, Germany would either have to leave it unmolested-a valuable outpost for us or she would be presenting us with constant objects for attack, and would undoubtedly sustain considerable losses.I am, therefore, very strongly in favour of the recession of the island if we are ever in the position to obtain it; and it should be fortified.To turn it over to a weak neutral would be useless, as the weak neutrals have proved as regards Germany more weak than neutral. To leave it to Germany, unfortified, will simply provoke disputes and difficulties should they commence to fortify, just as we are having a dispute with another country, or even internal troubles.A recession, it must be remembered,ds not the same thing as annexation after conquest, and should not leave any bitter feelings on the part of the Germans, who have misused what we presented them with.Perhaps you may think that in these notes my instinct is more apparent than my [472! &apos; D
logic, but I do instinctively feel that we should be wrong not to acquire and fortify Heligoland if Providence once more gives us tbe chance.F. C. T. T.October 26, 1916.. &apos; (7.)Reply from Commodore Lambert (Fourth Sea Lord).I. Does the possession of Heligoland by Germany help the German Fleet? Yes.(a.) Does it materially increase our difficulties in carrying out hostile operations in the Bight either (1) surface craft, (2) submarines, (3) aircraft? Heligoland as a fortified advanced base is a material obstacle to all operations in the Bight.(b.) If so, is this result due to the fact that heavy guns are mounted upon the island; or that it provides an important post of observation connected both with the land and sea by wireless ? or that its harbour materially aids the work of German submarines, minelayers, and destroyers ?This is due to the fact that it is a signal station, and also has harbour accommoda-tion for flotillas of destroyers and submarines which are well placed for threatening any inferior force operating in the Bight.(c.) Does it hamper our blockade ?(d.) Does it facilitate the movements of the High Seas Fleet?It has no effect on our blockade except to the extent that it facilitates the safe exit and re-entry of the German Fleet.II. 1. Would the possession of Heligoland by Britain help the British Fleet ? No.(a.) What garrison would it require in fime of peace to secure it against a coup de main ; and with what armaments must it be provided to make it safe and useful in war time?It would require a garrison of about 3,000 men and guns of varied calibres to make it safe.(6.) If it is to be treated as a fortress, could we tolerate the German population on its shores, or, indeed any population not directly required for the service of the garrison ? No.How far would the necessity of providing relief to the garrison, and of supplying food and munitions, hamper us during hostilities ? Would it interfere with our naval freedom of action ? W7ould it involve important risks either to our warships or our transports ?The difficulties of transport and communication in war, and the inevitable losses which these operations would involve, outweigh any probable advantage to us which might result from our possession of it as a fortress.(d.) Would the possession of the island help us to menace, by submarines or mines, the German Fleet either issuing from the Bight or returning through it ?Yes, but owing to the proximity of the island to the German main bases it would be possible for the enemy to so effectively screen the island by mine-fields that our vessels could only operate from there with difficulty and loss.(e.) Would an air station on the island prove a valuable source of information withregard to the movements of the High Seas Fleet ? and (/.) Would it constitute a serious menace to German naval bases and the Kiel Canal ?There is hot enough room on the island for an efficient air station ?2. If, as is probable, the answers to these questions do not all point in the same direction, how does the balance of advantage and disadvantage lie ?   In other
(8.)Reply from Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Oliver (Chief of the Admiralty War Staff).Replies to Questions.I- Yes.The island helps the German Fleet. It is a point of support. In clear weather the guns range over a circle of 15 miles&apos; radius and afford protection to retreating ships.(a.) It increases the difficulty of operating in the vicinity with any kind of craft.(6.) Yes. It has heavy guns, very well protected. It is connected by submarine cable and W/T. The small harbour is used as an advanced base for submarines and small craft.(c.) and (d.) Yes.II. Its possession would not help the British Fleet, which would frequently be required to cover vessels taking munitions and supplies to it, or to assist in its defence.Fighting in its vicinity would be very favourable to the Germans and unfavourable to us, on account of mines, submarines, and night attack by destroyers.It is very fortunate that we did not possess it at the beginning of the war, because we would have been forced by outside pressure, prompted by sentiment, to unduly risk the fleet.(a.) A question whose answer1 would vary every few years, due to progress in warfare and armaments.   Nothing but the best and latest armament would suffice. (6.) No.(c.) The freedom of action of the fleet would be greatlv hampered. Whenever the island required anything, a major operation on the part of the fleet would be necessary to get it there, involving risk of heavy loss.(d.) The possession of the island by us would be a trouble to the enemy and some assistance to us.   But the quantity of vessels maintained there would not be sufficientwords, putting ail questions of sentiment on one side, should we gain or lose as a naval Power by possessing Heligoland (a.) Ungarrisoned and unfortified ?(6.) As a subsidiary naval station, fortified and garrisoned so as to be secure against attack botl) at the outbreak of war and during its continuance ? It must be noted that in answering this last question the subject of cost must be taken seriously into account.Our object is to destroy or neutralise the action of the enemy armed vessels. This becomes more difficult if the Germans are in possession of the island, and more easy if we hold it, because it cannot then be used by them as an advanced base. But it must be noted that Heligoland, being an island, can only be held by the Power which controls tbe water area round it. . To hold that area a force of small ships covered by a massed fleet is necessary. Moreover, the massed fleet must be based on a protected harbour, so situated that it can give the cover required. Such a, harbour is available for the German Fleet, but not for the British, and therefore until the German main fleet has been destroyed, Heligoland cannot be held by Great Britain when at war with Germany.It is recommended that Heligoland should pass into our possession at the peace, that the defences should be completely demolished, and that it should be held hj us as a non-fortified post. In this way we shall deny it to the Germans, which is the important point.Assuming that this proposal is accepted, the policy in any future war will depend on whether the Germans have or have not a fleet at that time. If they have one, the island should not be held, because it would be without fortification and a strong garrison-; and if fortified and garrisoned it would, sooner or later, have to be relieved by the fleet, possibly under disadvantageous circumstances. In other words, it would be an encumbrance.If they have not one, the island should be held ; in that case a small garrison might be required to prevent the place being rushed.c LOctober 21, 1916.
to effect much, and the small harbour would be insecure from bombardment at long range and air attack.(e.) The island is too small to form an extensive base for aircraft. It would be valuable as a lookout station and for a small number of aircraft.(/.) Yes, a considerable menace, but it could not stop the fleet getting out. They could pass it by keeping near the coast in shallow water, where it would be hard for submarines to dive, and they could sweep channels daily, under cover of batteries on land, which couid keep our vessels at a distance.2. It will be to our advantage to have nothing to do with the island.Unfortified, but occupied by us, we should have to abandon it when hostilities were going to begin. Our having it in peace would only give the advantage of preventing the Germans fortifying it in peace. It would cost us a lot for no return, and politically would be used to keep up the desire in Germany to get it back.We should lose greatly as a naval Power by having a fortified Heligoland to maintain with the fleet. It would be another vulnerable spot to add to the many we have already.I do not think we could fortify it so that it could be certainly held at such a distance from our coast. It is much too small to make a first-class fortress of. and store munitions and guns and everything necessary for a protracted period of hostilities. It is so close to German bases that reducing it or blowing it off the map would be an engineering proposition which -could be solved with enough, time, money, and previous preparation.Guns on land are now effective up to about 20 miles&apos; range. Twenty-nine miles&apos; range would be necessary in order to bombard it from the shore, and in the next ten years guns will probably be capable of such a distance, or would be made for this special purpose. Numbers of craft of the monitor type, but heavily armoured, could be made.If Heligoland were moored 29 miles off the land at the Thames mouth we should find a way to take it; we cannot take it now because it is so far off our bases, and we cannot keep ships continually in its vicinity;H. F. OLIVER.October 4, 1916.(90-Reply from Commodore Tyrwhitl (Commodore (T.)). Answers to Questions on Heligoland.I. Yes.The artificial harbour of Heligoland is an excellent base for destroyers and sub-marines, from which these craft are able to emerge in any weather, regardless of fog  the latter being a serious drawback to their river harbours.(a.) 1 and 2. Yes, but somewhat nullified since the Bight was mined.   3. No.(b) The heavy guns mounted on Heligoland are dependent on visibility, and for this reason are not considered to be of great value.Heligoland provides an important observation post in clear weather for submarines, and the harbour already mentioned in I, materially aids the work of destroyers and submarines:(c.) Not in the least.(d.) Not materially, although it provides shelter and a somewhat exposed anchorage for the High Seas Fleet, and gives two exits.II. Yes, but I do not believe it could be held.(a.) No garrison could make it secure in peace against a coup de main, nor could any armament make it safe or of any use to us in war time.It is merely a matter of time before Heligoland will be within gun range of Wangeroog. The distance is 44,000 yards, and I understand that this range is already practical.(b.) No, certainly not.(c.) It would be impossible to provide reliefs and munitions in war time without
(10.)Reply from Commodore S. S. Rail (Commodore of Submarines).Dear Mr. Balfour, October 6, 1916.I attach replies to the printed questions you sent me. Though not strictly relevant to the subject I would, from the submarine point of view, like to take this opportunity of asking whether, when peace conditions are being considered, the abolition of submarines cannot be made the basis of our proposals.I am not sure if it is thoroughly realised what a great field there is for development in this type of vessel; the scope for ingenuity in design is almost unlimited, and it is possible to construct a navy of practically all classes of fighting ships, with the ability to submerge added to their existing qualities.I feel convinced that it is Germany&apos;s only naval means of neutralising the inferiority of her geographical position, that she now realises this, and that she will inevitably equip a submarine navy as soon as she can.The stimulus of war has not provided any real antidote ; it seems impossible for a vessel that only operates in one element to triumph in the end over one that has her choice of two.Such success as has been attained has been due to the war coming before Germany realised what submarines could do for her and at a time when they were in an early stage of development.Every advance or enlargement of submarine activity encroaches upon our position, and the matter appears to me to be so vital that it is suggested the war would have been well fought if abolition of submarines could result from it.It is believed that Germany has on one occasion agreed to abolition, and that France was the cause of the failure to come to an international agreement to this end. No doubt records as to this are available.Surely neutrals would support us, and very strong argument is available to assist. It could be claimed that the war has proved that submarines merely lead to destruction of life and property, much loss to neutrals, and the inevitable breaking of agreements without any decisive results on the armed forces of the enemy ; that it is in no sense conducive to progress in any peaceful requirement either as a means of rapid or safe transport or as an aid to commerce in any form.If total abolition is Utopian, guarantees for a rigid adherence to &quot; visit and search&apos;&apos; are the next best; this will rule out the small, cheap, &quot;sink at sight&apos;&apos; submarine.I owe apology for the length of this digression, but feel strongly that it is now or never. ^ It has been more on my mind after a four-day cruise in &quot; K. 3 &quot; that it is vital to abolish or restrict the commerce destroying capabilities of submarines.&apos; Yours sincerely,S. S. HALL.involving grave risks to our warships and transports, and incidentally would hamper rather than aid our naval forces.II. (d.) Yes, if my (c.) is incorrect.(e.) Ditto. (/.) Ditto.2. Heligoland would be made untenable from the guns of Wangeroog, besides being the constant target of innumerable aircraft by day and by night. We should lose prestige by being unable to hold it.(a.) It would be to our advantage to insist on Heligoland being ungarrisoned, unfortified, and unoccupied.(6.) I do not believe this is possible, and strongly advocate that one of the conditions of peace is that Heligoland is reduced to dust. All fortifications, air stations, houses and buildings of any sort or description, to be blown up, and the harbour to be filled up with the debris. The island to be considered a &quot;No Mans Land,&quot; and not to be inhabited, and no German ships to be allowed within 10 miles of what is left.R. Y. TYRWHITT.October 7, 1916.
I. Does the possession of Heligoland by Germany help the German Fleet ? Yes, see (o) of this answer.(a.) Does it materially increase our difficulties in carrying out hostile operations in the Bight, either by: 1. Surface craft. 2. Submarines. 3. Aircraft.Not materially. Though ;the removal of Heligoland armament and observation resources would make hostile operations in the Bight easier for surface craft, submarines, or aircraft, such removal would only get over one of the smallest difficulties, and would not turn the scale in favour of any operation which would otherwise be impossible.(6.) II so, is this result due to the fact that heavy guns are mounted upon the island; or that it provides an important post of observation connected both with the land and sea by wireless ? or that its harbour materially aids the work of German submarines, mine-layers, and destroyers ?German possession of Heligoland helps the German Fleet in that the island forms a valuable observation outpost, and point a&quot;appui for her patrols, not so much on account of the heavy guns as on account of. the harbour and the protection of the apex of the Heligoland Bight. As the island with its shoals covers 5 miles, it is easier to maintain the mine-fields and patrols, running roughly east and south from the island to the mainland, with this island in the centre. Neither the harbour nor the island materially aid the work of German submarines, except that the island being 270 feet high is a valuable navigational aid in the Bight, where the mainland is low-lying, the weather generally thick, and the water off the mainland is shoal to long distances from the shore.(c.) Does it hamper our blockade ?No.   Its possession by Germany must surely make for the efficiency of the German i anti-submarine craft in the Bight; and so adversely affects our submarines, but the net result is only to push our submarines a little further out and this cannot be said to affect our blockade.(d.) Does it facilitate the movements of the High Seas Fleet ?Yes ; to a small extent as an observation point and as an advanced support during a retreat; it facilitates the movements of the High Seas Fleet, particularly in the tactics they have adopted in the present war.As in (6), it makes the protection of the apex of the Bight triangle an easier matter, and so affords them some sea room for exercises, &amp;c., inside their mine-fields.II. Would the possession of Heligoland by Britain help the British Fleet?No; it is considered that its possession by us would be tbe source of a constant and heavy anxiety, expense, and loss, with no gain in the slightest degree commensurate with these disadvantages.(a.) What garrison would it require in time of peace to secure it against a coup de main; and with what armaments must it he provided to make it safe and useful in time of war ?This is not answered in view of conclusions arrived at.(b.) If it is to be treated as a fortress, could we tolerate the German population on its shores, or, indeed, any population not directly required for the service of the garrison ?No(c.) How far would the necessity of providing reliefs to the garrison, and of supplyingfood and munitions, hamper us during hostilities ? Would it interfere with our naval freedom of action ?Would it involve important risks either to our warships or our transports ?Supposing that the island remained tenable in spite of hostile bombardment from heavy guns and aircraft, a very large mine-sweeping and anti-submarine force would be necessary to keep the approaches clear, which would have to be based on the island in addition to the garrison.. The question at once arises, for what purpose is this enormous dispersion of force with a line of communication of 300 miles ?   The only purpose that
would justify it would be that of providing a base for large ships, but the place is not suitable for these; the utmost that could be accomplished would be a precarious hold for submarines and small craft, and the effort required out of all proportion to any result to be hoped for would be so great as to interfere with our naval freedom and involve important risks to all ships using the island as a base.(d.) Would the possession of the island help us to menace, by submarines or mines, the German Fleet either issuing from the Bight or returning through it ?(e.) Would an air station on the island prove a valuable source of information with regard to the movements of the High Seas Fleet ? and(/-) Would it constitute a serious menace to German naval bases and the Kiel Canal ?The answer to these three questions is yes, if other considerations are ignored; but the drain on our naval resources which the holding of the island would entail would be out of all proportion to these three advantages.(2.) If, as is probable, the answers to these questions do not all point in the same direction, how does the balance lie ? Should we gain or lose as a Naval Power by possessing Heligoland (a.) Ungarrisoned and unfortified ?(b.) As a subsidiary naval station and garrisoned so as to secure against attack both at outbreak of war and during its continuance ?Apart from sentiment, the conclusion is that the possession of Heligoland by us would amount to hanging a weight round our necks which in the end would strangle us, it would inevitably end in having to cut the rope, and this I believe to be the case to-day; feeling certain as I do that Germany after this war will equip a large submarine navy, the possibility in the future of being able to make any use of or even hold Heligoland is hopeless.S. 8.
