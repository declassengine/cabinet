Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET.BRITISH PROPAGANDA IN ALLIED AND NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.Note by Lord Robert Cecil.(Previous Paper No. G-101.)THE accompanying memorandum shows the immense amount of valuable propaganda work done by the News Department and those associated with it. I venture to add two or three general observations : 1. Official propaganda known to be such is almost useless, except, of course, in the form of State Papers.2. It is much easier to do harm than good by propaganda. A tactless interview will sweep away results of months of patient work. Eor instance, Lord Northcliffe&apos;s published observations on Spain did much injury, and I am afraid that some of my American interviews have created a good deal of trouble in the United States. Perhaps in each case the eventual result may have been less harmful than the immediate effect Avould have led one to expect.3. Much of the writing in the newspapers here has been harmful. Our national habit of self-depreciation is a handicap. Moreover, in many countries we are suspected of arrogance, and the most moderate criticism of foreign countries is, for this and other reasons, bitterly ressnted.   This is specially true in America.4 Germany and Prance, too, can do many things in America which would not be tolerated in us. I have discussed our propaganda with many Americans, e.g., Edward Marshall, Simonds of the &quot;Tribune,&quot; Moreton Prince, and many others. They have often begun by urging more active propaganda, but when asked for practical suggestions they have nothing to propose except more interviews and a better news service. As to the former, I incline to think that recently we have rather overdone the thing. As to the latter, I will say a word in the next paragraph. One thing is certain : that any attempt to have an organised British propaganda in the United States would bo fatal, as all of these men admit. It is doubtful if the Germans have gained by it. We should be simply ruined by any such attempt. I remember very well the disastrous effects of Horace Plunketfs efforts among the American correspondents here, and tremble to think of the mischief he may be doing over there now.   In American propaganda the only plan is to do good by stealth.5. Lastly, in war-time it is the facts that count, not words. All we can do to help by propaganda is to let foreigners know what is actually happening. If the events are discouraging they will be discouraged. No doubt we may also offend people by stupid observations, but we can never explain away disagreeable facts. German propaganda, properly so called, has, in my judgment, been everywhere a complete failure. Their victories have dazzled people, their cruelties have disgusted them; above all, their power and ruthlessness have frightened them sometimes into submission and at others into revolt. But their publications have done no particular good and have often done harm.R. C.Foreign Office, December 29, 1916.[150]B
British Propaganda in Allied and Neutral Countries.DURING the early months of the war, propaganda was cod ducted by three organisations: the News Department of the Foreign Office, Mr. Masterman&apos;s Com-mittee at Wellington House, and the Neutral Press Committee, all of which had come into existence when the war began. There was no appreciable overlapping by these three bodies and they worked in co-operation with each other, but there were manifest advantages in their all being placed under one control, and it was eventually decided, that, as propaganda in neutral and allied countries was clearly a matter in which the Foreign Office were best qualified to exercise supervision, this control should be in the hands of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Neutral Press Committee, of which Mr. Mair was secretary, was at a later date entirely merged in the News Department of the Foreign Office, though for convenience some of Mr. Mair&apos;s work, is still conducted from his own office, and Mr. Masterman&apos;s organisation at Wellington &quot;House works in close co-operation with the News Department, and consults it with regard to any new departures that may be contemplated.The principal functions of the News Department are: Seeing and supplying information to and obtaining facilities, including the arrangements for trips to the front, &amp;c, for the correspondents of American and other foreign newspapers in London; arranging interviews for them with promiuent persons; sending news telegrams and other propaganda material for allied and neutral countries to His Maje^ty&apos;s Representatives and to unofficial agencies which have been set up in those countries for the distribution of such material.Mr. Masterman&apos;s organisation at Wellington House produces and distri-butes li erature (pamphlets, &amp;c.) in many languages in allied and neutral countries, ihe organisation has a special pictorial department which distributes the official and other photographs abroad; it produces weekly, fortnightly, and monthly illustrated papers with text in almost all foreign languages; the exhibition of the official cinematograph films abroad is also under the control of Wellington House. Sir Gilbert Parker has a special department there for the United States; his principal activities consist in serfding out literature to and corresponding with a wide circle of influential people in America, and in producing a weekly summary of the American Press. He also co-operates Avith the News Department in obtaining interviews for the American correspondents. A detailed report of the work of Wellington House is attached, but that work is also dealt with to some extent in the notes contained in this memorandum. These notes have in most cases been prepared by the individual members of the News Department who are charged with the supervision of propaganda in the countries concerned, a fact which accounts for the use of the first person in some of them.Probably the mo?l, important part of the propaganda work is that conducted by means of granting facilities and supplying material to the correspondents of foreign newspapersin London, and this is now done in an increasing degree. In the earlier months of the war the War Office and Admiralty were reluctant to do much in this direction, imt we now obtain much assistance from them, the Ministry of Munitions, and other Departments. The whole position as regards visits to the British front in France has greatly changed ; for many months no correspondents were allowed there at all, but we have now for a long time past been sending weekly parties of neutral and allied journalists and other foreigners of distinction out to France. These parties have included 28 Americans, 22 French, 16 Italians, 13 Russians, besides Dutch, Swedes, Norwegians, Spaniards, South Americans, Japanese, Greeks, Swiss, and a Chinaman. General Headquarters have also arranged to have rjermanent correspondents of Allied countries and of the United States. As regards facilities from Government Departments at home, though we do not perhaps get all we want, we get very many, and the principal improvement that would be desirable is that other Departments should initiate suggestions in this direction oftener then they do; the present position is, as a rule, that the News Department, and the correspondents are constantly racking their brains to think of subjects which it will be interesting to work up, whereas the Departments themselves must be in a position to think of many things which come within their sphere which would be of interest abroad and would have a proportionate propagandist value.   At the suggestion of the News Department
The News Room.This room is the centre of the work of the Commission. All the English papers, monthly, weekly, and daily, are arranged here. There is an English reference library, writing tables, &amp;c. Every kind of question is answered here, and it is hoped that the room may be a permanent centre in Petrograd.Correspondence.Two secretaries deal with the Prussian correspondence, and with the filing of cuttings from the Prussian press. Letters are received from every part of Russia, and they are all answered to the best of our ability. Questions are of every kind social, economic, educational, military, literary, &amp;c.officers have been appointed in all the more important Government Departments to whom the News Department applies when it wishes to obtain facilities or information for correspondents.RUSSIA.It was decided in December 1915 that more organised efforts for British propaganda in Russia should be made. A Bureau was established at Petrograd, and the work was put into the hands of Mr. Hugh Walpoie, Major Thornhill, and Professor Harold Williams.The work of this Bureau, now called the Anglo-Russian Commission, is summarised by Mr. Walpole as follows : The work of the Office has fallen into the following divisions :  Press Work.Excellent relations with the Russian Press have now been established. It has been found by experience that articles by English writers are, with certain exceptions, to be avoided. The work must be done, wherever possible, by the Russians them-selves. To that end several Russian journalists are now attached to our staff. We have, on the advice of a committee of Prussian journalists, started the weekly issue 1. Of an English Bulletin. This is a weeklv collection of facts of everv sort and kind, made up by the members of the Commission, and sent out to every newspaper in Russia. The disadvantage of sending the same thing to many papers is here overcome, because with such a Bulletin the papers may choose any facts they please, using- some and rejecting others. We have reason to believe that this Bulletin is very widely used.2. We further issue our daily telegrams, sent to us from England especially for publicity purposes.3. Many articles are written, from information supplied by us, by Russian journalists.4i. We send to many papers series of facts with regard to various subjects, which the papers themselves can make into any form that they prefer.5. We issue a certain number of articles of especial interest written by Englishmen.6. WTe receive great numbers of photographs, maps, &amp;c, from England, which are distributed to the Russian illustrated papers.Entertainment.This must be regarded as of the very first importance. At present our efforts are confined to weekly luncheons. These luncheons are held in the offices of the Commission, and English and Russians of all kinds are invited to them. They have been a very great success, and, so long as the invitations are issued with care, the results promise to be of real importance.In Russia more may be done by personal friendliness than by any official pro-ceedings.   It is hoped that a number of evening gatherings may also be arranged.
Work in connection with the new Anglo-Hussion Society.Much work is being done in connection with the new Anglo-Russian Society.We are in daily touch with Professor Vinogradof, and Dr. Harold Williams and myself are members of the Propaganda Sub-Committee of his society. This Sub-Committee supplies us with Prussian help for translating and publishing purposes. We, on our side, supply them with every kind of English information.Projects in connection with the publishing of English books, the regular issue of English pamphlets, the series of lectures on England throughout Russia, &amp;c, are progressing.   We are working towards these objects in concert.Military Work.Major Thornhill has developed a very solid connection with the Russian army press. Captain Garstin is the member of our staff who has this work in hand, and now a regular flow of material photographs, articles, pamphlets, &amp;c. goes from the Commission to the front.Commercial.With regard to commercial questions, now of the very first importance in all Anglo-Russian affairs, the commercial attache of the British Embassy is under the same roof as ourselves. Wre refer, of course, commercial questions to him; but in certain directions as, for instance, the development of English advertising in Russian papers we have, with bis consent, formulated certain proposals.&quot;Mr. Walpole comes home at intervals to obtain literary and other material for the use of the Commission.In order to supplement the supply of British telegraphic news to Russia, an arrange-ment has been in existence for many months past by which the &quot; Times &quot; supplies daily telegrams, which are paid for from public funds and sent through the iNews Department to papers in Petrograd, Moscow, Kieff, and Kharkov..The exhibition of British cinematograph films in Russia has been in charge of Captain Bromhead; he has been most successful in his work, a full description of which will be found in Mr. Masterman&apos;s report.FRANCE.The need for propaganda to convince the French that Great Britain is taking her due share in the war has varied from time to time, but things have considerably improved in this respect since the offensive on the Somme. Conditions in France are not suitable for the establishment of a British Bureau similar to that at Petrograd, but much has been clone bv the distribution of literature and hvthe insertion of articles, through the British section of the Maison de la Presse, in the press of Paris and the Provinces. A great deal of propaganda has also been done by means of inviting distinguished French writers to England and to the British Front to see and write about things for themselves ; in this matter special attention has been paid to the French provincial press. A need has long been felt for a better service of British telegraphic news to France, and especially to the provincial press, and arrangements are now being made for the supply through Reuter&apos;s of a free service of this sort. Suggestions have been made for the establishment of a special news agency in Paris for this purpose, but the weight of opinion is in favour of making use of and developing existing agencies.ITALY.Much distribution of useful literature in Italy has been done by persons working under the general supeiwision of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador. As regards the daily press, a good deal has been done by granting facilities to the Italian correspondents in London, and by arranging visits to the Front for them and for others specially invited from Italy; but unfortunately there are very few resident Italian corre-sponclents in London, and some of those who have been here were not much use. A special Reuter service of telegrams, paid for by His Majesty&apos;s Government, is sent to Italy and well reproduced there.Much useful work, supported by His Majesty&apos;s Government, has been done in Italy by two Belgians, MM. Lorand and Destrees ;* the latter is still working for us
there. His most useful achievement has been the production of a book on England&apos;s effort, which has been widely distributed, and for which very full ma^orials were supplied by Wellington House.We have also an independent agent, Mr. Hutton, working as a private individual in Tuscany and Northern Italy.JAPAN.The propaganda work undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Japan has been entrusted to Mr. Robertson Scott, an experienced English journalist who has estab-lished relations with the Japanese press and has published several articles in different newspapers. A large number of articles and other material (e.g., extracts from captured documents) have been supplied to Mr. Robertson Scott for this purpose by the News Department. He has also brought out a book in Japanese. Thanks to the generous and patriotic action of a well-known British resident in Japan it has been found possible to proceed with a scheme for starting an Anglo-Japanese magazine, of which Mr. Robertson Scott is to be editor and manager. An influential committee has been formed in London to assist and advise in the preparation and publication of the magazine.The weekly summaries of military news supplied by the War Office are telegraphed to Tokyo and are much appreciated by the Japanese public. Reuter&apos;s Agency supplies a selected service of 8,000 words a month, retransmitted from Shanghai, and it is considered that so far as Japanese consumption is concerned this service is adequate.Wellington House has prepared an illustrated paper, entitled &quot; Senji Gaho,&quot; with captions in Japanese and English, on the lines of the Chinese &quot;Cheng Pao,&quot; which will be issued fortnightly and distributed in Japan through the agency of a committee especially formed for that purpose by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo.ROUMANIA.Until the evacuation of Bucharest daily telegrams were sent to Bucharest, and distributed from an agency established for the purpose there. A special Reuter service was also supplied. Two or three important publications have been produced in Roumanian, such as an edition of Raemaekers&apos; Cartoons and the Report on the Wittenberg Camp; and arrangements have lately been made with a Roumanian journalist resident in England to send through the Legation articles in the language of the country for the Roumanian press; special facilities have been obtained for him from the War Office and elsewhere.Articles have been sent direct to certain Roumanian papers from Mr. Mair&apos;s office since an early date in the war.UNITED STATES.Judicious propaganda is probably more necessary in the United States than in any other country, and it is in that country that the matter has to be handled with the greatest care.The most important channel used by the News Department and those who work in conjunction with it for influencing American public opinion has been found to be the distribution of a large supply of healthy news. In America more than any other country this is the most efficacious means of countering the German propagandists intrigues.The Middle West.At an early date in the war the importance of the Middle West, as an area needing special attention, was fully realised.In some ways it is true that the Middle West is less pro-Ally than the Eastern States or even those bordering on the Pacific. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that, owing to remoteness, it is indifferent rather than antipathic to the Allied cause.The Great States of the Middle West contain a large German and Irish population. The Germans in many of the towns have been long settled, and are much respected. As a mass they probably avoided the excesses of Count Bernstorff&apos;s henchmen, who formed only the minority of German Americans. The presence of this saner German population seemed to give the lie to much of what the Middle Westerner read about the German atrocities in Europe.[150] C
The Irish were either irreconcilable or largely under the influence of a seminarist priesthood, and even those who were not formed a very poor channel for conveying satisfactory views of the British cause or British aspirations to the Middle Westerner.Besides the Germans and the Irish there were large Scandinavian colonies and some Slav. Torn as these were by internecine feuds, they were united in resenting, the only Allied action with which they really came into touch, the holding up of the mails from Scandinavia and Central Europe.The remoteness of the Middle West and its lack of touch with more important quarters are no new things. Americans will speak of its lack of touch with Washington, and will instance the pitiful scenes which accompanied the mobilisation of the Militia in some of the Middle Western States.Historians record how, except for the German element, there was great and apparently irremovable indifference manifested by the Middle States to the issues of the American Civil War.Undoubtedly the magazine is one of the best means of catering for the Middle Westerner. The &quot; Saturday Evening Post,&quot; :i Every Man&apos;s Magazine,&quot; the &quot; Century,&quot; the &quot; Outlook,&quot; and others are to be found in almost every verandah in these Middle Western streets, and we have concentrated on just the sort of article which the Middle Westerner enjoys that is to say, the semi-scientific, semi-philosophic article about the war and all that has arisen from it.As far as daily papers are concerned, we are much handicapped by the fact that there is a lack of Middle Western correspondents in London. We have endeavoured to remedy this, but so far Avithout success, at any rate as far as the daily neAvspapers and daily news are concerned. As far as articles AAdthout actual news value are concerned, much good work is done by many of the important syndicates, like that managed by Mr. Curtis Browne.Two Chicago papers whose articles have a large circulation in the Middle West, in their own columns or those of other papers the &quot; Chicago Daily News &quot; and the &quot; Chicago Daily Tribune &quot; we have been able to help in many ways. The latter, a somewhat pro-German organ, has printed a good deal from its able correspondent, Mr. Philip Patchin, while one or two of its itinerant correspondents, especially a certain Mrs. Warren, have written good articles of a healthy nature. It will be remembered that an interview with Lord Grey of Fallodon, probably one of the most important interviews of the Avar, Avas given to the &quot; Chicago Daily News,&quot; and in the columns of this paper, which is very friendly to our cause, articles provided by their London correspondents, often with the assistance of the NeAvs Department, are matters of an almost daily occurrence.Other papers which we have been able to help in this manner might be mentioned. Possibly the &quot; Kansas City Star&quot; is the most important. We are investigating the very difficult question of getting in touch with that influential but pro-German organ, The &quot; Cincinnati Enquirer.&quot; The staff of this paper Avants treating with special circumspection, and it is in matters like this that we have to rely upon the assistance of Captain Gaunt.It should be remembered also that the great news agencies the Associated and the United Press serve hundreds of papers of the Middle West. One interview of Sir Maurice de Bunsen was given to the United Press, and, as an experiment, I asked to see in how many of the smaller papers it Avas produced. Mr. Keen, the London manager, sent me sixty papers and then I asked him to stop. Many of these were small papers of one sheet, published in country towns of Avhich the names are scarcely known in England; but if this is typical of the usual distribution, and I have no reason to suppose that it is not, it is very satisfactory.When an inter view is given to one of the New York papers, a point is always made by the -News Department and by Sir Gilbert Parker of insisting upon its syndication in the Middle West. Thus, it may seem foolish at first sight to give an interview with&apos; Admiral de Chair upon the blockade to the &quot; Brooklyn Eagle,&quot; an evening paper in New York, but that particular interview was reproduced in twenty-five other papers, largely because we had made an agreement with Mr. Suydam to syndicate it widely. Again, an interview with Lord French on the Belgian deportations, which was given to the &quot; Chicago Daily News,&quot; was reproduced in papers in each of the following towns: New York, Cincinnati, Providence, Montreal, Philadelphia, Denver, Toronto, St. Paul, Kansas City, Vancouver, and twenty-four other cities of Canada and the United States a distribution which one must consider satisfactory. Finally, Captain Gaunt assures us that the best means of reaching even wider publicity in the Middle West is to spread our net from New York outwards.
Supply of News.So far as the News Department is concerned our constructive efforts in this direction take two forms. In the first place, we have the censoring of American messages very largely in our hands as an advisory body to the Press Bureau, although the Foreign Office has no technical censorship any longer. This is an instrument of value: as all cable messages from the Central Powers to the United States pass through London, where almost all the American papers have their European managers, we can observe the German falsehoods as they come red-hot from Germany and can prepare answers to them which in cases of importance the London correspon-dents of the American papers will frequently carry with the original message. Again, the friendliness which we have encountered at the hands of the American press representatives forms a fund upon which we can draw in the case of awkward or undesirable telegrams which the correspondents in London propose to send. We can almost always get such telegrams modified and not infrequently stopped altogether with their consent.   Of course this has to be done with care.In the way of providing actual news we have been able to do a good deal by our influence with the other Government Departments. Naturally enough these Departments have their attention directed more to the matter which concerns them than the shifting currents of opinion in neutral countries. To give an instance, we were able to impress upon the Irish and War Offices that it was essential that London correspondents of the American papers should be sent to Dublin when the rebellion broke out, and the consent and help of these Offices were productive of excellent results. Again, we discovered that the treatment of the conscientious objectors was a sore point in certain pacifist circles in the United States, and we were able to approach the War Office with a view to obtaining reassuring information. We are at present studying the publicity aspect of the action of the Federal B/eserve Board in consultation with the Treasury, and this is typical of the co-operation between our Department and other Offices through a continued series of journalistic situations in America for the last two years. It might astonish some outside observers if they knew how much we had succeeded in stopping that might have been disadvantageous to us in the press of the United States; if, for example, they knew how we stopped the execution of Roger Casement being taken up in every paper of the United States, or if they understood how a lid was put upon discussion in the New York press of the appointment of M. Sturmer to office, to give two instances only. The outside w^orld knows only when we are unsuccessful or only partially successful.By far the largest section of the news that reaches America does not of course emanate from the brain of the News Department but from that of the American corres-pondents. They are constantly thinking of points upon which they want information, and it has been the News Departments work .to see that this information is provided. The American Administration admits the representatives of papers to far closer confidence than does ours. An American journalist observed laughingly to me ir i want to know something about foreign affairs from the State Department I walk into Lansing&apos;s room and ask him.&quot; Owing to the kindness of prominent English officials we have to some extent reproduced this open condition of things. Once a week the American correspondents are seen by Lord Robert Cecil who answers any questions that they care to put to him upon matters of foreign affairs or the blockade.One further instrument of publicity should be mentioned. It will be remembered, that about eight months ago a big Allied bazaar was held in New York. It was called a bazaar, but might be better termed an exhibition of military and naval objects of interest and war relics. The French display was magnificent, and they took some 200 000L in entrance fees. Our own was less good, but largely through the instru-mentality of Captain Thwaites and the kindness of the Admiralty, War Office, India Office and other public Departments, we have entirely turned the scale in Boston. I heard&apos;last week from Captain Thwaites that they had had 40,000 persons in one day in Boston, that they had exhibitions of Zeppelin relics, guns, war gear, &amp;c, and had dug trenches in a neighbouring plot of land. He hoped that a very large sum would be realised in the ten days that it would be open in that city.About the middle of January the bazaar will be moved to Chicago, thence to St. Louis, and thence on to Minneapolis, and there is little doubt that it will have great influence in stimulating pro-Ally enthusiasm and in explaining the Allied achievements, more especially as a series of lectures by Captain Ian Hay Beith have been arranged in connection with it.
Lord Derby has been giving them similar interviews every fortnight on politico-military affairs. General Maurice sees them every Thursday at the War Office and talks to them with a more than American frankness on technical military matters. When I was in the United States last month I saw the enormous effect which these talks of General Maurice could produce. He would often be quoted in the next column to some German assertion in order to give it the lie. At the Admiralty, Captain Hall, the Director oi the Intelligence Division, gives a similar interview once a week, and every day at 5 o&apos;clock a member of the News Department sees the Americans and answers any questions on the routine work of our foreign politics and even other matters. These meetings are largely attended, and every day there is some point which has to be looked up or made clear. One of the American correspondents confessed that what with these weekly interviews, and those which they have with Mr. Page and Mr. Skinner, he thought their time pretty well filled up.The Provision of Facilities.It is not only a matter of answering questions. Having a news sense that delights in the concrete, the American journalists in London have an insatiable appetite for seeing incidents and institutions. Sometimes it is an interview with a Cabinet Minister on the shipping question, sometimes an interview with a banker on the financial position, sometimes it is permission to see a submarine, sometimes to take a flight in an aeroplane, sometimes a visit to a training-camp, or a prison for Irish rebels, or a munition factory, or a hospital, or facilities to see American maikcensored, or a seat in the House of Commons during an important debate, or a talk with the head of the Department of the Y\rar Office which deals with decorations. I could go on with almost any number of instances, for every day has something, and during one month alone the News Department provided fifty facilities of this kind for the resident American pressmen in London.All the above, it will be seen, refers to the representatives of the American papers of New York and of other cities, of which there are about thirty, in London. There is a good deal which it is difficult to formulate on paper, for these correspondents are extremely important to us, and. they have constantly to he nursed and humoured. For example, it is not of course the routine work already described which gives the greatest bother. The moments during which most anxiety was felt lest there might be an unpleasant change in the nature of news sent across were moments when, for some reason or other they thought that they had been slighted. Two occasions occur to me. The first occurred when a most indiscreet article appeared in &quot; Land and Water &quot; describing a visit of an American journalist to headquarters in France, and how he had shown the white feather when in the firing-line. The incident did have some truth &quot;about it, though it was unknown to the author of the article and as far as he was concerned, the incident was imaginary. Somewhat naturallv the American correspondents, who, to do them justice, have always shown courage at the front, were exceedingly angry, and for a week were ominously sulky and difficult to deal with.The second occasion was wdien articles of Mr. Curtin be^an to appear in the British press. Rightly or wrongly they left that he had betrayed the interests of American journalism in procuring a false passport and abusing the hospitality of the country to which he was accredited. Considering the very high sense of journalistic honour which the American correspondents have always displayed, and which has been of use to us on more than one occasion, our personal sympathy was wholly with them. Undoubtedly it did far more to upset the American press than any other recent incident. The American Luncheon Club was broken up by resignations because the Committee had entertained Mr. Curtin, and when I discussed the whole matter with the head of the Associated Press in New York on the 24th November I found him very sore about it. There is a need therefore to get the American journalists in good temper, and I am not sure that this is not one of the most important bits of work that the News Department has to do.Important as the resident correspondents are, we cannot rest content in dealing with them alone. New York is the hub of United States journalism to a greater extent than is sometimes imagined, and the greater papers are distributing centres to the lesser papers dotted about in other parts of the United States, and especially in that very important area, the Middle West; hut at the same time we have need of an organisation in New York, to which we can send special stories for distribution to papers who have no correspondents in London, and deserve a pat on the back or
a piece of favouritism in return for some local service to the British cause. The man upon the spot is Captain Gaunt, the naval attache, and to him we frequently cable out a special piece of information. For example, the day that Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s new Cabinet was announced, we sent rapidly a number of anecdotes of a trivial but sensational description illustrating alike the iron will and domestic benevolence of the new Ministers. The London correspondents would not have &quot;carried&quot; these, hut out there they were greedily snapped up and certnin papers were put under obligation to Captain Gaunt, while the new Cabinet was made a greater reality to American public opinion. Every week some material goes out accompanied by small items of interest, like pieces of captured Zeppelin or rubber concealed in a husk of coffee berries. The Admiralty sends out a number of stories of the fleet; these, except by saying that they, are always of an interesting nature, need not be described. Our organisation for sending out to Captain Gaunt, on the spot, information and articles of tins kind is increasing every day, and I daresay that it will soon reach very large proportions. When I returned from America I reported that I thought it essential that all the general super-vision of our propagandist interests on the spot should be concentrated.in the hands of Captain Gaunt, who would, of course, delegate specific functions to his subordinates, a view which was, I believe, accepted by the Admiralty and the News Department. I need hardly point out that many questions with which we are in conflict with America are naval or blockade questions, and that, therefore, the close collaboration Between the Admiralty and Foreign Office is the more desirable, particularly because Captain Hall, Sir Douglas Brown rigg, and Commander Walcott have found a means of working in the nearest and most friendly fashion with the News Department.A weekly letter of comment upon the general, political, social, business, and journalistic events is sent by the News Department to Captain Gaunt. The use to which he puts it is best expressed in his own words: &quot; I assure you your letters are most valuable. For instance, your letter arrived at 11 o&apos;clock this morning. I lunched in a private room with fourteen men, seven of whom have a tongue that works at both ends, and I&apos;ll bet you wouldn&apos;t recognise your letter now, as extracts are gravely repeated on the Cotton Exchange, Stock Exchange, and places where men of this city gather together.&quot;There are other bodies with whom our contact is close. I need only instance the Belgian propaganda body under M. Davignon; while much quiet useful work is done through individuals with bodies like the Scandinavians, Poles, or Homan Catholics in the United States of America.American Jownalists in England.Quite apart from the representatives of the daily American papers, there is large and increasing body of itinerant Americans passing through Great Britain. As a rule these write not so much for the daily papers as the monthly, and the matter that they require is not so much sensational as matter that requires more prolonged study. We have tried to deal with these persons, and we are perfecting our machinery for getting into touch with them. They are very jealous of their independence, and my feeling is that To set up anything in the nature of a French Maison de la Presse would be unfortunate, since it would be taken as indicative of a desire to influence their opinions in a way desired by the British Government. I may give a few instances to show the. kind of persons with whom we have had to deal, and the kind of subjects which they wish to study. Mr. Freeman has written articles in the &quot; Atlantic Monthly,&quot; &quot;New York Outlook,&quot; the &quot; Worlds Work,&quot; the &quot; Century,&quot; and other prominent magazines, and his articles have been reproduced under the author&apos;s name, or anonymously in English papers like &quot; Land and Water,&quot; the &quot; Cornhill,&quot; &amp;c. He has treated such subjects as &quot;What each of the Allies thinks of the others,&quot; the &quot; Future Relations of England and America,&quot; &quot; England in the Far East,&quot; the &quot; German Colonies in English Hands/&apos; and so forth and so on. Mr. Arthur Gleason, a well-known writer, has had an interview with the Prime Minister, has written articles on the change that has come over female labour since the war, has discussed the future of Trade Unions, and is now on a visit to Ireland. Mr. Hard, like Mr. Gleason, writes for most of the well-known magazines of standing in the United States, and has had oppor-tunities of seeing the training of English naval officers, has studied the work done by the Welfare Department of the Ministry of Munitions, has been to the Fleet, and inspected naval repair stations. These are only three instances of many. Perhaps this. [150] D
side of our work needs most strengthening- at present. The Americans, especially those in the Middle West, are great magazine readers, and take their opinions very largely from magazines. They see amongst them the German community, on the whole, a body of respectable and unfrightful persons. They hear deplorable stories of, let us say, the maltreatment of the conscientious objectors, and they are apt to think that the Germans after all are not the Huns they have been painted, and that the English are not true democrats.One of the ways in which we have been handicapped in the News Department is by the fact that it is very difficult to find out exactly what is going on, and more often than not there are subjects lying to hand which we never hear of, because those responsible for them hide their activities under a bushel. Eor example, I understand, there is a department taking form for the purpose of drafting the men with the colours into civil life when the war is over. If only the people responsible for that would say to us, &quot; Send along one of your journalists who has the power to write and is an intelligent man with some knowledge of social economy. We will make a friend of him, keep him more or less permanently in touch with this office, explain the problem that lies before us, and how intimately it is connected with the future of democracy, take him along with us in our efforts to solve the problem, from time to time let him produce an article here an article there, explaining to the Americans what we are doing.&quot; If only Departments would do this we could be sure that the magazine readers of America, who spread from coast to coast, would know that the future of democracy in England was not desperate, and that our civil servants were very much alive. I remember talking with one of the most intelligent American reporters, to whom it was a revelation that we have a great active all-embracing bureaucracy in England. He said that the American people had no idea of this and was still only interested in debates in Parliament which was the only thing the American press used to &quot; carry.&quot; Here is the key to the difficulty. The Government Offices have a tradition of silence and Parliament has not. It is this tradition of silence only very very slowing breaking down that forms the chief difficulty Avith which the News Department has to contend.Beside the journalists there are numbers of visitors from America to England. If they are of any importance we always try to get into touch with them, send them to the front or the fleet, and on their return to America keep in touch with them by private correspondence. Let me give an instance of what was done under this heading by the News Department last week. Members ot the News Department wrote private letters to A, a Professor of Economics in the University of California, enclosing financial statistics for which he had asked for the purpose of reading a paper before one of the big economic societies of America ; to B, the head of a big association of veterans of the Civil War, a man who travels from one end of the union to the other, meeting the local branches of his society; to C, the leader writing sub-editor of the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot;; to D, a New York practitioner, the physician of Pierpont Morgan, a man who is constantly moving about in a New York fashionable set; to E, a former correspondent of the United Press in London, lately at San Antonio in Texas ; to F, a correspondent of the Associated Press, who is tourina- round India and sending articles home for imbrication in America. These were all written by various members of the News Department, and took the form of private letters written from a private address giving news about the military and political situation of a kind that the recipients would probably pass on. In many cases they were answers to specific questions. The News Department has a stream of about one every day passing out in this fashion to what is now a large and increasing number of persons.It may be well to take a recent event and explain its treatment by the News Department. As soon as the news of the Belgian deportations was received in England the Belgian Propaganda Committee and the News Department evolved together a plan of campaign which opened Avith an interview given by Lord Egbert Cecil to the Associated Press. This Avas reproduced in a vast number of United States newspapers, and made a good beginning.M. Carton de Wiart, at the suggestion of M. Davignon, cabled privately to prominent persons in NeAV Y&quot;ork adjuring them not to let the matter rest. As a result a protest meeting was organised in New York City, and, oAAdng to the adroit manage-ment of Captain Gaunt, not only Mr. Root attended, but the General Commanding the Eastern Department (General Leonard Wood), who Avas accompanied by his staff. The significance of this can be appreciated if the growing political influence exerted by General Wood in recent times is realised.
Each day the correspondents were supplied with detailed stories both by M. Davignon and the News Department. The &apos;&quot;&apos; Chicago Daily News,&quot; a paper of considerable influence in the Middle West, made a particular feature of these stories, and ran special articles for four days.The aim has been to back up those Americans on the spot who were following up the New York Meeting of Protest with others. We have tried to provide at intervals important utterances on the subject of the deportations calculated to attract notice, accompanying these with a continuous stream of small stories each day. Of the former a statement by Lord Bryce was the first. An interview with Lord Erench has since followed, and we have in train another interview with Mr. Appleton, repre-senting the labour aspect.Wellington House.The activities of Wellington House are well illustrated by their full and interesting report. It will be, perhaps, best if I quote a passage from my private report on my return from America. It may seem that there is some criticism in it, but it is the criticism of some one who never, till he went to the United States, realised the wonderful work that was being done by this distribution. Sir Gilbert Parker&apos;s correspondence with prominent Americans and his resume of the American press is always invaluable.&quot; I must not forget to mention that I heard many complimentary references to the work of Sir Gilbert Parker. Most of the prominent men I met seemed to be on his distribution list. I gathered that if he could extend the number of recipients in the south, west, and middle west, it would be desirable. One friend of mine, who travelled about the country, said he found comparatively few persons reached in the interior. He also said that Sir Gilbert need not be afraid of sending simple narrative pamphlets. One, &apos; From Dartmouth to the Dardanelles &apos; (or some such title), a simple description of the career of a midshipman, had had a wonderful success in this, and he was still being asked for copies. He quite agreed that it was best to concentrate chiefly on argumentative literature, blue-books, white papers, and the like, because these were never seen by the average American, but the inclusion of a simple narrative from time to time would do good. Often a friendly Congress man would hand his pamphlet over to his local newspaper, which would be only too glad to insert extracts from it. I was astonished to find how familiar Sir Gilbert Parker&apos;s distribution was. At a dinner of twenty persons gathered together by chance in Philadelphia the five people nearest me were all upon Sir Gilbert Parker&apos;s list.&quot;Finally, we may mention the presence of lecturers whom we have encouraged in America. Among these are Dr. Hand of Harvard, Captain Beith (Ian Hay), and Mr. Alfred Noyes. Mr. Noyes, who is Professor of English at Princeton University, has for some months past been working in London with the News Depart-ment as his headquarters. He has been given facilities for writing articles on military, naval, and other matters of interest, and the material that he has produced has been of great value in America and also in other neutral countries. He is about to return to America, where he is to undertake an extended lecture tour. It has been our policy to encourage lecturers when there seems reasonable excuse for their presence in America, but to discourage the mere hack lecturer who is taking on the work for money making or self-advertising or obviously propagandist reasons. It is probably not an over-statement to say that 75 per cent, of those who would like to go and lecture in America would do more harm than s-ood.SPAIN.Mr J. Walter, of the &quot; Times,&quot; has been in Madrid, with occasional visits to the provinces, for many months past, and conducts a kind of unofficial Press Bureau for the Foreign Office. He distributes (1) telegraphic news, (2) newspaper articles, (3) photographs for reproduction in newspapers and for exhibition.Two cables a day are sent from Mr. Mair&apos;s office, containing news and appro-priate comment from the Allied point of view. Mr. Walter distributes them to about half a dozen of the most important Madrid newspapers not under German control or influence, and to two Bilbao papers. (The wireless message from Carnarvon is also primarily meant for Spain.   It is not circulated through Mr. Walter, but is taken up
by the Spanish Oompania de Telegrafia sin Hilos and given out to subscribers, along with the German messages from Nauen. Subscribers are not allowed to take the German wireless, or ours, alone.)Mr. Walter receives a large number of articles, written in Spanish, from Mr. Mair&apos;s office, and a few in English which he has translated locally from the News Department. These are not much printed in the Madrid papers (though they occasionally appear there), but they are very widely reproduced in the provincial newspapers all over Spain, down to the obscurest country towns.Illustrated papers in Spain are popular and successful. The photographs which we send to Mr. Walter appear with great frequency even in some papers (e.g., the &quot; A.B.O. &quot; and the &quot; Nacion&quot;) which are either, like the former, pro-German in tendency, or, like the latter, definitely under German control. There are also shops in Madrid, Barcelona, and elsewhere which admit a perpetual and constantly renewed exhibition of the British official photographs.The Spanish press is poor : paper is dear, and the newspapers are almost all sold at a halfpenny. We help several with money subventions usually nominally as payment for advertisement space (which we hardly ever use). This is an unpleasant but necessary form of propaganda in Spain.We distribute pamphlets and the illustrated Spanish newspaper &quot;America Latina &quot; very widely sometimes by post (the distribution of &quot; America Latina&quot; is chiefly so effected), sometimes through pro-Ally committees in various towns, largely through consuls and steamship lines. In the same way picture postcards &quot;and occasional illustrated journals are sent. We have an almost complete list of the barbers&apos; shops throughout the country, which are kept supplied with much propagandist material.   We occasionally send Spanish pro-Ally books to clubs in all jDarts of Spain.The subsidiary races of Spain are not neglected, and we make occasional publi-cations in Catalan and Basque.The photographs, books, pamphlets, and illustrated papers are produced by Mr. Masterman&apos;s committee at Wellington House.Spanish journalists in England are sent to the British front and given other facilities with some frequeue)-, and write excellent articles on their experiences for the newspapers of which they are correspondents.SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA.Propaganda is conducted on principles generally similar to that in Spain, but differing a good deal in detail.Telegraphic propaganda is mostly effected by a subsidised Reuter service to Buenos Aires, whence it is distributed to Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. The South American papers are always anxious for material, and all, except those actually under German control, will print very nearly everything that is sent them by cable. A similar service on a smaller scale has lately been started for Central America and Mexico, with distributing centre at Panama. We also send a weekly cable  meant primarily for the obscurer places containing a summary of the British military news, with a few items of general interest, for the previous week.Spanish articles are widely sent out from Mr. Mair&apos;s office, and gladly and freely printed in the press over a great part of the continent. We also send a good many articles in English: in most of the capitals the Ministers have a little local committee, which arranges for the translation of such articles and their insertion in newspapers.Photographs are now sent in fortnightly packets to most South American countries; to some, where the press is poor and cannot afford the cost of reproduc-tion, the actual blocks are sent, ready for immediate printing.Illustrated newspapers are very successful: &quot; America Latina&quot; in Spanish America and &quot; O Espelho &quot; in Brazil.Pamphlets are widely circulated through Ministers, Consuls, and steamship lines. The appetite of Brazil for these is insatiable ; in quite small places the consul can often take two or three thousand, and finds a brisk demand for them all.I am glad to say that we subsidise no newspaper in the continent.Propaganda in South America is not nearly so necessary as in some other countries, feeling either being quite strongly for the Allies (as in Brazil), or at any rate not hostile. There is still work to be done in Central America, where the German trade hold is strong.
Englishmen locally resident do a great work in South America : the British and pro-Ally committees work hard and successfully.HOLLAND.There is a very large service of British telegraphic news through Reuter&apos;s, at Government expense, to Holland, and this is very fully published in the Dutch press, and a considerable amount of news is also sen t bv Beuter&apos;s by mail. Dutch translations of articles from the British press are circulated daily to all Dutch papers in. towns and provinces, free of cost. There is a very large distribution of literature in Dutch, produced by Wellington House, through various channels. Numerous official war photographs are distributed and exhibited in public places, while commercial firms are assisted in the production of pictorial advertisements depicting scenes with the British armies, &amp;c. The London correspondents of Dutch newspapers are given assistance and guidance, and facilities are procured for them in many directions. A Bureau has been established in Rotterdam under the control of His Majesty&apos;s consul-general, which exercises a general supervision over these and other propagandist activities.Propaganda in the Netherlands East Indies may be divided into two sections : Propaganda among the Dutch there resident, and propaganda among the natives of the islands and the immigrant Arabs and Malays.Much the same lines are followed as in Holland, but to a considerably less extent, for the Colonial Dutch have primarily only a local interest in the war and&apos;are on the whole very well disposed to the Allies, knowing that their problem in Java is much the same as ours in India. A certain amount of general propagandist material in English and in Dutch is sent to Mr. Beckett at Batavia, who is almost alwavs able to get it into two or three of the most reputable local Dutch papers. He is also able to distribute a very large quantity of pamphlets and illustrated journals in Dutch. The delicate question when dealing with the Netherlands Indies is always Japan and her alleged designs of extension in that direction. .The native population of the Netherlands East Indies is almost entirely Mahommedan, and some mention of the work done among them is made in another section of this memorandum. Our single attempt to circulate material in Javanese is temporarily in abeyance owing to the fact that the Dutch colonial authorities have stopped the import of the Javanese translation of the Moshi document; they have made it clear that they do not welcome too active a propaganda among their Moslem subjects. Mr. Beckett is also able to distribute a certain number of illustrated news-papers with text in Oriental languages.SCANDINAVIA. Sweden.The greater part of the British propaganda in Sweden is conducted through the Stockholm Bureau, a Eranco-British institution, under the joint control of French and English agents respectively. The business manager is a Swede, Lundberg by name, who is also a partner of the publishing firm of Olzon and Lundberg, which specialises in-pro-Entente books and pamphlets. The Bureau sends out domestic and foreign news to Swedish newspapers, and distributes advertisements. From the London end, daily cables, containing the official reports, news both general and of a propagandist character, and commercial intelligence, are despatched from Mr. Mair&apos;s office in Victoria Street. In addition, two or three propagandist articles and a London letter are sent out weekly from the same office.Public Opinion.Sympathy in Sweden is fairly equally divided between the two belligerent parties. From a political point of view, the Conservatives are, generally speaking, pro-German, and the Liberals and Socialists pro-Entente. Of the Conservatives the &quot; Activists,&quot; influential as they are, only form a minority. The majority ia pro-German in sympathy, but carefully watches which-way the cat is likely to jump. This leads to a rise and fall of the Activist influence and numbers, in accordance with the military situation at the moment.At the present time, for instance, there is sure to be a certain recrudescence of [150] E
pro-German influence and agitation owing to the Roumanian disaster. On the whole, it may be definitely stated that Sweden is not now pro-German, that if a referendum of the population were taken there would be a pro-Entente majority, and that the Activist element, which in 1915 seriously threatened to drag Sweden into the war on the German side, has very considerably lost in power and influence. The whole trend of movement of public opinion has been towards the Entente for months past, ever since it was borne in on -Swedish opinion that Germany might lose the war.Newspapers.The Stockholm Conservative papers are all pro-German. One Liberal paper (Stockholms Tidningen) reputed to be closely connected with the Government, is strictly neutral, while the other great Liberal paper (Dagens Nyheter) and the Socialist paper (Hjalmar Branting&apos;s organ) are distinctly pro-entente, the latter very markedly so.Norway.We have for some weeks past had an agent in Christiania, and it is hoped that he will soon be able to build up a Bureau on the same, though more modest, lines than the Stockholm Bureau. In addition to this, arrangements are being made to supply the Norwegian Telegram Bureau in Christiania with daily wires.Public Opinion.The overwhelming mass of the Norwegian people is strongly pro-Entente, but their intense enthusiasm for England, so apparent at the beginning of the war, has been considerably damped by the inconvenience necessarily caused by some of our blockade measures. Still they love us, despite the fact that some of their illusions are gone. There are a few &quot; intellectuels &quot; who are pro-German, but they hardly count in the mass. The unsatisfactory feature in Norwegian public opinion is the Socialist attitude; for the Socialists are total disarmament and peace-at-any-price folk, who, rather than run the risk of war, would make the greatest concessions to Germany.Newspapers.Of the Christiania papers, Morgenbladet and Verdens Gang are the only ones which occasionally show an anti-Entente bias. The official Government organ, Intelligenssedler, is strictly neutral, while practically all the other papers are distinctly pro-Entente.   All, however, pride themselves on their neutral attitude.Denmark.In Denmark we have up to now no agent, and if we had one his task would be a peculiar one, for there are few to convert they are practically all in full sympathy with the Entente. It needs, however, more than propaganda work to dispel the fear of Germany, which lies heavy on the whole of Denmark.Public Opinion.This is, of course, strongly anti-German. Only among the Socialists is the pro-German element to be found, and then only among the party leaders. The Danish working-man is not pro-German.Newspapers.Of the Copenhagen papers, the Social Demokraten, which represents the views of the Socialist party leaders, is consequently pro-German. AU the other papers are either neutral with a pro-Entente bias, or frankly pro-Ally, except the Radical Politiken, which, while professing neutrality, has many a stab at the Entente. This paper is one of the best edited, and has as good a foreign news service as anv in Scandinavia.:      SWITZERLAND.A -pro-Entente distributing agency has been established at Berne, to which daily messages are sent by telephone via Paris. There is also a special Reuter service of telegrams.
A large supply of press articles are sent to an experienced journalist working in connection with HisMajesty&apos;s Legation, who has special opportunities of securing their publication in the press of both German and French Switzerland, and these articles seldom fail to appear. Articles are also inserted in the Swiss press through other channels.There is undoubtedly a great change for the good in the attitude of German-Switzerland and the German-Swiss press towards the Allied cause: French-Switzerland has always been almost exaggeratedly pro-Ally as a whole.GHEECE.The principal centre of British propaganda in Greece has been a small Press Bureau in connection with the Legation under the charge of Mr. Gerald Talbot. News telegrams have been sent twice a day to the Legation since the early days of the war, and Mr. Talbot, at any rate until the recent disturbances in Athens, has had a great measure of success in placing them in the friendly newspapers, as well as various articles which have been sent him to be translated locally. He has also supervised the production at Athens of about twenty pamphlets, mostly translations, made on the spot, of English pamphlets produced at Wellington House. A wide distribution is also made, both in Greece and among Greek Colonies abroad, of a weekly illustrated pro-Ally journal, the &quot;Hesperia.&quot;CHINA.In the early stages of the war the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Legation in China were directed principally to placing before the more enlightened and educated classes in China translations of available literature showing the origin of the war and the justice of Great Britain&apos;s cause. Chinese translations were accordingly made and widely distributed, with the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s consular officers, to all officials, Chambers of Commerce, and notables throughout the country, of the following pamphlets: The White Book on the European Crisis : &quot;Why we are at war with Turkey&quot;; &quot;The Scrap of Paper, the German Chancellor^ statement and Sir Edward Grey&apos;s reply&quot;; &quot;The Memorandum on the first three months of the War&quot; ; &quot; The American Verdict of the &quot;War&quot;; and a pamphlet in Chinese, prepared by Messrs. Brunner, Mond, and Co., of Shanghai, and distributed in all the Provinces with the help of Eis\Majesty&apos;s consuls.Apart from the above documents in the vernacular, a great number of pamphlets in English were also given a wide circulation.Subsequently, in order to combat the increasing propagandist activities of our enemies in China, and the broadcast dissemination of mendacious reports by the German consuls and agents, it was found advisable to create a central body to co-ordinate British efforts in China in regard to the distribution of pamphlets and news, and to reach and interest a much larger audience. With this object in view a &quot;War Propaganda Committee &quot; has been instituted at Shanghai under the chairmanship of His Majesty&apos;s consul in that port and subject to the general supervision of His Majesty&apos;s consul-general, which, by availing itself of the services and organisation of the Christian Literature Society, a missionary body with widespread ramifications throughout the interior, is to undertake the entire work of translating and distributing pamphlets and other suitable literature among the Chinese. The subject matter for this propaganda will be supplied periodically to the Shanghai Committee by Wellington House, which is also publishing fortnightly a very effective illustrated paper in Chinese, entitled &quot; Cheng Pao,&quot; 50,000 copies of which are distributed by the Committee, and a large number through private channels. The Governor of Hong Kong and the Commissioner of Wei-hai-Wei also distribute a large number of this paper in the districts under their control. His Majesty&apos;s Government are assisting the Shanghai War Propaganda Committee by a generous monthly subsidy. Arrangements are also being made, with the assistance of some of the leading British firms at Shanghai having agents in the interior, for the development of a form of commercial war propaganda which it is hoped will further our trade interests and at the same time keep British efforts and superiority in the war before the Chinese by means of advertisements, posters, and almanacs, in which use is made of military photographs and other material supplied from this country.As regards the dissemination of news, Reuter&apos;s Agency supply a full service of 32,000 words monthly to Shanghai, which is reproduced in English newspapers [150] F
published in that port. Reduced services are transmitted to Peking and Tien-tsin and other of the more important Treaty Ports, and arrangements exist for the translation of the most interesting portions of this service into Chinese and its circulation to the Chinese newspapers. In places where the English community is not large enough to collect sufficient subscriptions towards the Reuter service, His Majesty&apos;s consular officers have been authorised to supply the deficiency at the public expense.PROPAGANDA AND COUNTER-PROPAGANDA AMONG MOSLEMPEOPLES.Moslem peoples within the sphere of the Eoreign Office are mostly in Egypt and the Soudan, Persia, Java, North Africa, and various places of less importance, such as Loanda, some inland parts of Liberia, and Madagascar. There are also Moslem colonies in various places in South and Central America.Attempts are made to counteract enemy propaganda among Mohammedans, especially the seditious Indian propaganda which emanates chieflyfrom the United States and Switzerland, by the stoppage of the distribution of pamphlets and newspapers through the post and otherwise. The Erench and Italian Governments have prohibited the circulation of such matter in their respective possessions. The Italian Government, at the suggestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, have requested the Government of the United States not to include it in United States mails to Italy (i.e., to carry out their undertaking under the Rome Postal Convention of 1906), and a request has been made to the French Government to do the same. The Siamese Government have already made the same request as that of the Italian Government to the United States; in this case the latter refused. Representations have constantly been made to the United States to put a stop to the issue of the &quot; Ghadr,&quot; &amp;c, hitherto without success. A joint representation from the British and French Governments to the Swiss Government to prevent the postal circulation of such matter is now under consideration.The Foreign Office, in conjunction with the India Office, circulates as widely as possible a propagandist newspaper, &quot; El Hakikat,&quot; with text in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Hindustani. Similar periodicals have lately been started, one with text in Chinese, which will be useful for Kansu and Chinese Turkestan ; and a second with text in four Indian languages, which will be useful, as far as this Department is concerned, for Indian colonies in neutral countries. Similar work is being done with other publications in Arabic, such as for example the Moshi document (the latter has been circulated in all languages spoken&apos;by Moslems, including Chinese and Javanese); the Shereefs proclamation; a Map of the World at War, with Arabic text; an edition of Raemaekers&apos; Cartoons, with explanatory text in Arabic; and an Arabic translation of Dr. Ruy Barbosa&apos;s famous speech at Buenos Aires: and there has previously been a distribution of two Arabic pamphlets ; Cook&apos;s &quot; Great Britain and Turkey,&quot; and another entitled &quot; The Violation of Belgian Neutrality.&quot; Wide circulation has also been given to the true story of the deposition of the late Sheikh-ul-Islam and to the manifesto of Bosnian Mohammedan students in Switzerland.This Department also regards the previously mentioned places as the proper recipients of occasional telegraphic news, and such messages are sent when events happen of particular interest to Moslems for example, the success of the Shereef and the discovery of the Moshi document. The authorities in Egypt have been asked to telegra*ph direct to the consul-general at Batavia any important news of this nature.As regards North Africa, an arrangement has been made with the British authorities in Egypt to send copies of loyal Arabic newspapers to Tripoli, Algiers, Tunis, and Tangier. (At Algiers, Tunis, and in the French zone of Morocco, His Majesty&apos;s representatives are always instructed to obtain the previous consent of the French before any publication or distribution, and the same procedure applies to some extent in Madagascar.) Some photographic picture blocks are now beginning to be sent to Tangier for publication in the local press.A certain amount of material of Moslem interest is sent to Rio de Janeiro and to Buenos Aires. At the former place the British consul-general is able to obtain the insertion of a considerable quantity of such matter in local Syrian and Arabic newspapers; to good effect, for there are 20,000 Arabs in and near that place. At Buenos Aires the number of Orientals is also large, and a vigorous propaganda is there conducted by the Emir Emin Arslan, formerly Turkish consul-general, who now works openly in favour of the Allies.
SUMMARY OE TELEGRAPHIC PROPAGANDA.It may be well to summarise the news telegrams sent from, or under the auspices of, the Eoreign Office : Wireless messages covering all the news of the day are sent daily, one from Carnarvon and one from Poldhu.Two telegrams are sent daily to Mr. Walter, at Madrid.Three to the Bureau at Stockholm.Two to the Legation at Athens.Two to the Legation in Roumania.Two to the &quot;National Tidende,&quot; Copenhagen.Telegrams go three or four times a week, as the need arises, to the Embassy at Petrograd, for distribution by the Bureau there, and a daily telegram from the &quot; Times,&quot; as stated above, goes to newspapers in in Petrograd, and three other towns in Russia. The &quot; Morning Post &quot; supply similar telegrams to go to certain neutral countries.A weekly war summary of all fronts and a weekly summary of general news go to a large number of countries.These are all, of course, in addition to an extensive service of news telegraphed by Reuter&apos;s for the Government, and are intended chiefly to supplement the Reuter service in countries where, for various reasons, experience has shown that that service does not cover all the ground.This Memorandum, prepared at short notice, does not pretend to be entirely exhaustive, or to cover every individual propagandist activity undertaken by or under the auspices of the News Department of the Eoreign Office : there are necessarily many isolated pieces of propaganda arranged by the Eoreign Office which cannot all he included in any general statement, such, for instance, as the visit to Spain by arrangement with the News Department Gf Mgr. Deploige, Professor at Louvain, who no doubt did much to improve the state of feeling in clerical circles in Spain, and who was the promoter of the address to Belgium from Spanish Catholics; or the reproduction and sale all over the world by Mr. Selfridge of the &quot; Lusitania&quot; medal, which should serve as a lasting reminder of German methods, but the Memorandum will, it is hoped, suffice to give a general idea of the propaganda work that is being done. A hankering after an institution on the lines of the Maison de la Presse in Paris has from time to time manifested itself in some quarters, but I am convinced, after an experience dating from the early days of the war, that the general control of propaganda in Allied and neutral countries should continue to rest with the Eoreign Office, and that the headquarters should be at the Eoreign Office itself, as they are now. It is that Office which is concerned with most of the current questions, about which the foreign, and especially the American correspondents, want daily information, and it is necessary that the officials whose duty it is to see the correspondents should keep in constant touch, under the same roof, with the Departments of the Eoreign Office which deal with the subjects of their enquiries, in order to supply them Avith information with the promptitude that is essential in these matters. The correspondents, and especially the Americans, will come much more freely to the Eoreign Office, which is the natural place for them to seek information and facilities from, than they will to an office known to be established for propaganda purposes. Moreover, it would be quite unworkable to have our various organisations in foreign countries independent of the Embassies and legations, which would necessarily he the case if they Avere under the control of a separate authority in London.The part which the Admiralty, the War Office, and other Government Depart-ments can best play in propaganda matters is to supply the News Department of the Eoreign Office for propaganda purposes with as much news and material concerning the matters which come within their respective provinces, and as many facilities for foreign correspondents, as is possible consistently with the public interest.Foreign Office,December 20, 1916.printed at the foreign ovtice bt c. e. harbison.-9/1/1917.
