Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET.Gr-141. -c:    -xWHEAT SUPPLIES.Notes by Mr. Joseph Davies. (Previous Paper No. G.-139.)AN examination of the statistical position justifies the joint conclusion of the above memoranda, that the position of our wheat supplies constitutes a question of grave urgency, demanding strong and immediate action.The appended statistics show that it is probable we can provide for our needs of wheat until the 30th September next, when our 1917 crop will be harvested. All attention should therefore be concentrated on our position at that date, when with twelve months to run no further home supplies can be had.By that date our available shipping will according to the estimate of the Shipping Controller be reduced from its present figure of 8,000,000 tons to 6,800,000 tons; and neutral shipping will decrease in at least as great a proportion. In addition there is the risk of further loss through raiders.The following factors must also be taken into consideration : 1. That British shipping tonnage will probably continue, after September, todecrease at the rate of at least 200,000 tons per month. 2. Neutral tonnage supplies will decrease in a proportion at least as great. 3. That there is a possibility of losses through submarines and raiders exceedingthe present estimate of the Shipping Controller as shown above. 4. That a.failure in the American 1917 wheat crop similar to that of 1916 might. force the United States of America to limit, if not prohibit, exports. 5. That, in addition to our needs, we are largely responsible for supplies to ourAllies ; and that to run risks of shortage for ourselves is to endangerFrance and Italy.Under such conditions it cannot be too strongly urged that this country will be in a position which must cause grave anxiety if the opening of next winter finds us with a stock of wheat representing less than six months&apos; consumption. Even with a six months&apos; reserve then in hand, the national consumption will require an average import of 280,000 tons of wheat per month in order to carry on to the harvest of 19.18.The Necessity for a 600,000 Ton a Month Programme.^ As shown in the following statistics, this safety-line cannot be reached except by an immediate increase of imports up to 600,000 tons a month : Tons.For April, the prospective imports are ..      ..      ..      ..      459,000For May and June      ,,        \,, ..       ..       .......       535,000Making for the three months ..       ,.......      994,000Against this, our actual consumption during these three months will be 1,600,000 tons, of which home-grown wheat will furnish 400,000 tons and the imports should provide 1,200,000 tons. &apos;Thus, unless the present programme&apos; is materially increased, in the next three months, a period during which our tonnage supplies will be greater than they are likely to be (Luring the rest of the war, we shall be steadily eating into our reserves.Every week that is allowed to pass will make the problem of securing the necessary reserves more difficult. &apos; .      -The required stock can only be built up month by month, as, irrespective of snipping difficulties, the loading and discharging ports are limited in their capacity for handling grain. To secure transport for 600,000 tons per month it is [466]
clear that a drastic readjustment of the 1917 calls on our shipping must be made. The following suggestions are also put forward : 1. Raw Cotton.Imports from United States of America, first two months of 1917, 127,000 tons.At 24th March, 1917, the stock of American cotton at Liverpool and Manchester was 155,000 tons, equivalent to two months&apos; supply. In addition, large stocks were held in manufacturers&apos; hands. It would therefore be possible to prohibit the import of cotton for two or three months, or better to limit it to 25 or 30 per cent, for a longer period. If needful, cotton mills could be put on part time. The whole of the tonnage saved could be diverted to wheat, and as both come from the United States of America, with cotton costing four or five times as much as wheat, weight for weight, our exchange with United States of America would benefit. The Committee on restrictions of imports did not recommend any reduction in cotton imports, but they stated that, in their opinion, &quot; the matter should be further considered.&quot;2. Wool.Imports from Australia, first two months of 1917, 42,000 tons.Some of this space could probably be. diverted to wheat without risking essential supplies of woollen goods for the Army.3. Russian Wheat.Russia has promised 500,000 tons of wheat from Archangel.   In view of the vital importance of securing this, and the uncertainty of Russian promises, it is suggested that our representatives in Russia should be supplemented by a special Commissioner or Commission, whose sole duty would be to see that the wheat is sent to Archangel / and shipped.This supply is the more valuable as it will reach the United Kingdom and France i in ships which would otherwise return light from Archangel.4. American Tonnage.Now America has definitely come inj an immediate effort should be made to secure the assistance of American shipping and German shipping in United States of American ports in conveying the necessary increase in wheat supplies to this country.The Possibility of Preventing Famine by Substituting other Cereals for Wheat.The suggestion has been put forward that in the event of wheat supplies failing the utilisation of barley and oats for human food would &quot; secure the nation against actual starvation, even if no food supplies whatever could be imported.&quot; On this point the following statistics are put forward : Annual production of Cereals and Potatoes.
