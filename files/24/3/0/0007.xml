fThiRDncnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!Printed for the War Cabinet   January 1917.SECRET.CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAFFIC).Memorandum by Lord D&apos;Abernon.1. ORDERS of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) are now in force over by far the greater part of Great Britain. Under these Orders the hours for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor are rigorously curtailed ; the practice of treating, and the sale of liquor on credit are prohibited; the strength of spirits has been reduced ; and other regulations of a restrictive character have been imposed.2. From all quarters favourable reports have been received of the remarkable improvement which these Orders have brought about; and unmistakable evidence has been forthcoming to show that, notwithstanding the largely increased spending power of the industrial classes, the measure of success attained by the Board&apos;s Orders has been far greater than might have been anticipated from a policy of restriction unaccompanied by fundamental reorganisation of the trade. But on the evidence before them the Board are convinced that, though there has been great improvement, further substantial progress is attainable. The successful prosecution of the war is still being hampered by excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor.3. This excessive consumption is of serious consequence to the efficiency of our fighting forces, especially in regard to material. Looked at from another point of view it involves wastage of the nation&apos;s food supplies, and prevents economy in the use of the nations resources in the matter of sea and land transport. In the light of the experience which they have gained during the last eighteen months, the Board are of opinion that the time has now come when comprehensive measures, beyond their present powers, are necessary in order to carry to completion the work of restriction and control which the Board were established to discharge.4. There are three possible policies : (a.) More stringent restrictions ; (b.) Prohibition; and(c.) Direct and complete control by,the State of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor throughout Great Britain.6. With regard to (a) the Board are of opinion that the limits of effective action by alteration of the existing Orders have been well-nigh reached, and that any further action on these lines would be inadequate to obtain the further progress which is necessary for the best efficiency of the nation. What is required is not modification or increased stringency of the existing Orders, but their stricter observance. For this a different and less imperfect machinery is needed. In many areas, and those the areas in which excessive drinking is most prejudicial to efficiency, the Orders now in force admittedly do not and cannot produce their full effect on account of the inherent difficulty, under present conditions and with the Trade as now constituted, of securing the compliance of the public and the Trade. The pressure of competition in the Trade, aggravated as it is by a redundancy of public-houses, has made it difficult for licensees to employ measures of restraint which may have the result of irritating customers, and diverting trade to competing houses.6. With regard to (6) the policy of prohibition has beem widely canvassed during the war, but as at present advised the Board do not feel justified in recommending its adoption. They do not regard it as essential for the conduct of the war, provided that sufficiently stringent measures of control are applied. From the purely financial point of view, it would probably have the disadvantage of involving the State in the payment of large sums as compensation, apart from the loss of a considerable proportion of the national revenue. And there are obvious objections to any policy adopted for the-period of the war which would be likely to lead to violent reaction when the war ia over.
7. The remaining policy, namely, direct and complete control by the State, has already in four areas Carlisle, Gretna, Invergordon, and Enfield been put to the practical test of experience by the Board. In all these areas the results so far achieved, even in the short space of time during which the Board have been in possession, and in spite of exceptional difficulties, including the influx of a large temporary population, have been most encouraging. Excessive drinking in these areas has been substantially reduced, and measures have been taken to meet the demand for improved conditions in the supply of food and non-alcoholic refreshment.8. State control has come to be regarded with more and more favour as being the I policy which offers the most rapidly effective and the best permanent solution of the \ problem.   Local authorities in adjacent areas have urged the Board to provide, by an extension of the existing boundaries, for their own inclusion in the area within which State control is now in operation.9. The Board are satisfied that State control would give the following important results: (a.) Strict observance of the law.(b.) The elimination of all private profit in the sale of liquor.(c.) The immediate suppression of many thousands of redundant licences.id.) The regulation of the quantity, quality, and strength of liquor, facilitating theconservation of food supplies and the more economical use of transport, (e.) Extended facilities for the supply of food and non-alcoholic refreshment. (/.) The amalgamation and reorganisation on an economical basis of manufacturingand wholesale businesses. (g.) The release of a large number of men and women for work connected withthe war.Although not an essential element in a scheme of State control, the temporary suspension of the sale of spirits would become immediately practicable if deemed necessary by the Government in the national interest.10. With regard to the financial aspect of the policy, the Board desire to point out that suppression of licences, concentration of businesses, the reduction and economical use of land transport would result in a large saving of working expenses ; and that, in their opinion, no apprehension need be felt as to the effect of the proposed reform on the annual revenue of the State.11. The Board have considered the possibility of assuming control of the drink traffic for the period of the war only, or as a preliminary to purchase at some later date, but they are satisfied that both on financial and on administrative grounds a policy of purchase outright is by far the more desirable course to adopt in the particular circumstances of the liquor trade. Acquisition, except on a permanent basis, would make it impossible to bring into full effect a revised and improved system of manage-ment, the central feature of which is undoubtedly the substitution for tenants of salaried managers having no financial interest in the sale of liquor. The governing authority could not, deal effectively with concentration of businesses, reconstruction and adaptation of premises, and with the staff of the various undertakings and licensed houses. The expedient would be a costly one, involving the payment of large sums from the Exchequer in the form of compensation, without securing to the State the advantage of permanent control. If State control is to be adopted, purchase outright appears to the Board to be the most practical and the only financially sound procedure.12. Having regard to all these considerations, the Board recommend that the policy of State purchase be adopted.13. The Board have not deemed it necessary at the present stage to refer to the basis on which compensation should be paid to the various interests or to the precise method by which direct control should be exercised. With regard to the basis of compensation, His Majesty&apos;s Government have already at their disposal the reports (Cd. 8283 and 8319) presented in April 1915, by the Liquor Trade Finance Committee appointed to consider tins question in its relation to England and Wales and to Scotland. The question of the best means to be adopted for the exercise of direct control has for some time past been engaging the attention of the Board, who have accumulated a considerable mass of information on the subject. The Board would be prepared, if so directed, to submit a full report on this and other relevant questions for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(Signed) D&apos;ABERNON, Chairman.December 16, 1910.
