Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET. G.-105.RESTRICTION   OF  IMPORTS.Preliminary Report op a Committee Appointed by the War Cabinet to Consider and Report on the Question op the Restriction of Imports.I PRESENT to the Prime Minister and to the War Cabinet a preliminary report of the proceedings of the Committee appointed by them on the 21st December, 1916 (War Cabinet 18-12), &quot; to consider and report on the question of the restriction of imports.&quot;The Committee held their first meeting on the 4th January, and started their work with a review of the attempts made during 1916 in the direction of restricting imports.1. In February last the Shipping Control Committee suggested a reduction of over 13,000,000 tons as compared with the previous year. The Board of Trade replied that reduction to this extent was impracticable, but they hoped to prohibit to the extent of 4,000,000 tons per annum. Later the Board of Trade modified this figure to something over 2,000,000 tons, and finally Mr. Runciman recently announced that the prohibition was, in fact, between 1,500,000 tons and 1,800,000 tons per annum.- 2. The Committee had before them a number of papers dealing with the subject, including two memoranda by the Board of Trade, dated the 1st and 2nd January, 1917, showing the difficulties of prohibition resulting from our relations with foreign countries and the Empire.A survey of the facts contained in these papers showed us that it is necessary to re-examine the whole case ab initio, and to determine what departmental machinery, if any, should be set up to carry into effect a real restriction of imports on a large scale.3. It at once became clear that there were two main questions to be decided, namely : (a.) The total amount of imports to be restricted.  -(6.) The nature of the articles to be restricted.(a.) The Amount of Imports to be Restricted.In considering this question, the determining factor is the supply of shipping available. Just as there has been, and continues to be, a shrinkage in merchant tonnage, so, in the same degree, there must be a reduction in imports. This restriction has so far been unscientific in character, and, unless imports are brought into closer relation with tonnage, before long the situation, both as regards shipping and the supply of necessary commodities, will be one of acute crisis.Thanks to Sir Norman Hill, who has made a close study of the subject and submitted valuable statistics showing the decrease in tonnage referred to in the report of the meeting on the 4th January (Appendix I), the Committee have been able to obtain an estimate of the amount of shipping available during the present year.It is estimated by Sir Norman Hill that, during this year, there will be a decrease of 10 per cent, in British tonnage and 25 per cent, in neutral tonnage, owing to submarine losses and other causes mentioned in Appendix 1.This shrinkage, translated into tons, means about 500,000 tons per month, or, say, 6,000,000 tons per year.While the Board of Trade do not like to pledge themselves to the accuracy of these figures, at the same time they concur in the view that steps must be taken at once towards a substantial reduction in imports.[173-2] B
We have, therefore, decided that two alternative programmes should be drawn up : one showing a restriction of imports to the amount of 250,000 tons per month, the other showing a restriction rising to 500,000 tons a month.4. Having now arrived at a basis upon which to start the work of restriction, we proceed to the next question.(b.) The Nature of the Articles to be Restricted.At our first meeting some discussion took place as to whether we should ourselves determine what articles are to be allowed in and what shut out.It was felt, however, that the members of the Committee are too much occupied with other matters to sit de die in diem hearing the evidence of representatives of the various trades and Government Departments.5. It was therefore decided at our second meeting, of which a report is shown in Appendix II, to appoint an Interdepartmental Committee composed of officials of the different Departments who,&apos; by their expert knowledge, are well equipped to conduct the necessary examination.We have issued instructions to them as to the nature of their work (shown in Appendix II). They will have daily sessions for a fortnight, and at the end of that time they will report to us upon the result of their labours. When we have received and considered their report, we propose to address the War Cabinet again on this subject.6. There remains one point to which the Committee desire most earnestly to draw the attention of the War Cabinet, namely, the importance of compensating for the decrease in imports by developing to a corresponding degree the resources of this country. In the report of our proceedings (Appendix I) it will be seen that the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Munitions, and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, each from the point of view of his own Department, referred to this most important question.The Committee are well aware of the many and great difficulties of developing home resources at this time, but they feel that whatever can be done towards the increase of supplies and manufactures in this country will mitigate to some extent the very serious blow to trade tbatKmust be the outcome of a restriction of imports carried out on the scale which is new necessary.(Initialled) C. of K.January 9, 1917.APPENDIX LThe First Meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on Restriction of Imports, held at the Privy Council Office on Thursday, January 4, at 3*30 p.m.Present:Lord Curzon.Dr. Addison.Sir Albert Stanley.Sir Joseph Maclay.Sir Maurice de Bunsen.Sir Norman Hill.Mr. S. H. Lever.This Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet on the 21st December, 1916, &quot; to consider and report on the question of the restriction of imports.&quot;1. Lord Curzon gave an account of what had been done during 1916 in the direction of restricting imports. He referred to the proposals made by the Shipping Control Committee, and pointed out the very small degree to which restriction had actually taken place.   The Shipping Control Committee had suggested a reduction of-
over 13,000,000 tons as compared with the previous year. The Board of Trade had said that reduction to this extent was impracticable, but they hoped to prohibit to the extent of 4,000,000 tons per annum/ Later the Board of Trade had modified this figure to something over 2,000,000 tons, and finally Mr. Runciman had recently announced that the prohibition was, in fact, between 1,600,000 tons and 1,800,000 tons per annum.   The papers on this subject, which were before the Committee, were : (1.) Letter from the Shipping Control Committee to the President of the Board ofTrade, dated the 10th February, 1916. (2.) Letter from the Shipping Control Committee to the Prime Minister, dated the19th March, 1916.(3.) Memorandum by the Board of Trade, pointing out objections and difficulties, 4th April, 1916.(4.) India Office Memorandum, 27th December, 1916, containing suggestions as to (a) carriage by neutral ships, and (6) stoppage of re-export trade.(5.) Memorandum by the Board of Trade, 1st January, 1917, pointing out difficulties of prohibitions resulting from our relations with foreign countries and the Empire.(6.) Memorandum by the Board of Trade on Restrictions of Imports, 2nd January, 1917.A review of the facts contained in these papers shows that it is necessary to re-examine the whole case ab initio, and to determine what departmental machinery, if any, should be set up to carry into effect a real restriction of imports on a large scale.2. Sir Albert Stanley said that at present imports had not been brought into relation with tonnage, and the result of this could only mean that before long there will be a shortage of necessary things. The actual needs of the country had not been considered, and restriction so far had not been scientific in character. The question is how are we to reconcile the actual needs with the amount of available shipping. The machinery for dealing with the subject at present is totally inadequate. Sir Albert Stanley said that it is vital that we should see how far we can develop the resources of this country, as, for instance, in the supply of metals. He pointed out that in the matter of motor-cars there had been no real restriction. Pleasure cars were brought in in 1916 upon the representation that there was a need for private cars. The mere fact that the Unitea States is an open market in which anyone can buy, gives reason to suppose that we are buying there and not developing the resources of our own country as we should do. It must be remembered, however, that this question of developing our own resources is primarily one of man-power.    s3. Sir Norman Hill submitted a memorandum on shipping tonnage and prohibition or restriction, together with some &quot; physical&quot; statistics showing to what extent shrinkage in tonnage had already taken place, and to what extent he estimated a further decrease due to submarine losses and other causes. He estimates during the year a further decrease of 10 per cent, in British tonnage and 25 per cent, in neutral tonnage, both of which estimates may be regarded as low.The following are some of the causes affecting the decrease in carrying power : (a.) Deviation of vessels to avoid danger zones, e.g., the distance from Gibraltar to London is 1,313 miles; recently one of Lord Inchcape&apos;s ships from Gibraltar to London made a voyage of 2,560 miles.(b.) The inefficiency of the crews, owing to the fact that the ports have been swept of efficient seamen. A 17-knot Cunarder on a recent voyage made 17 knots through the danger zone, si&apos;owing that her engines were all right, but during the rest of the voyage she averaged only 13 knots.(c.) Bunkering and rate-fixing experiments have chased neutrals from this country to safer and more lucrative trades. It is only natural that a neutral vessel should prefer to trade between North and South America rather than between Great Britain and Italy.Sir Norman Hill estimates the shrinkage of tonnage at about 500,000 tons per month, or, say, 6,000,000 tons less than last year.4. Dr. Addison, speaking for the Ministry of Munitions, said that he was quite sure that something drastic must be done and without delay. He gave figures showing the shortage of his supplies of lead and steel, and how he was 300,000 tons [173 - 2] &quot; B 2
a month short of iron ore. At the moment the Ministry of Munitions are faced with the fresh problem of importations of raw material instead of the manufactured articles.Dr. Addison submitted two suggestions :-(1.) That Government Departments should help the Shipping Controller by appointing in each Department a Shipping Priority Committee, which should report once a month to the Shipping Controller, emphasising the urgency of their particular needs.(2.) That each of the Departments concerned should contribute to an Inter-departmentid Committee, composed of representatives of the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, the War Office, the Treasury, and the Board of Trade, who should settle amongst themselves, as far as possible, their competing claims.The wish for some such interdepartmental Committee as that suggested by Dr. Addison has also been expresed by the Admiralty and the War Office.5. Sir Norman Hill pointed out that a decision ought at once to be made as to what we must have in the way of food to keep the country going, and that the country should at once be put on a sound basis of rations.   He suggested : (1.) That vessels should be requisitioned for all Government cargoes of wheat, meat, and munitions.(2.) That there should be a big and strong list of articles which ought not to be allowed to come in.(3.) That there should be a further list of articles which should take their chance for space in vessels. He thought that under a system of absolute prohibition, as suggested by the Shipping Control Committee in February last, there might be a tendency to lose space in vessels.The question of timber was also discussed. It was reported that there are twelve ships in the port of London waiting to discharge while timber is blocking the quays. Yet we continue to import 300,000 tons of sawn timber per month.6. Mr. Lever explained the position from the Treasury point of view, and emphasised the advantages which would be gained if, for instance, wheat could be obtained from Russia, and if we could use more rice. The exports from the United States to this country amounted to something like 2,500,000 tons per annum of steel alone. We ought to make every effort to replace as much of that as possible with home ore. This question of home supplies had previously been referred to by Sir Albert Stanley, and Dr. Addison pointed out that the difficulty in the way was one of labour.7. With reference to the position of the Foreign Office with regard to our Allies and neutrals, Sir Maurice de Bunsen said it was clear from the statements which had been made that we must explain to French, Italians, and Japanese the true facts of the case. The Foreign Office would support the Committee in seeing these restrictions carried into operation. Some discussion took place as to whether this Committee could do the work of giving effect to the restriction of imports on the lines suggested, or appoint another Interdepartmental Committee, such as that suggested by Dr. Addison, to deal with the matter.8. It was decided, in the first instance, that Sir Norman Hills memorandum  involving, as it did, such a colossal undertaking, which would attack and destroy for the time being many vital industries should be carefully considered by members of this Committee, who would bring their views on the matter to the next Committee meeting on Monday, the 8th January, at 3 f.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 4, 1917.
APPENDIX II.Meeting of the Restriction of Imports Committee, held at the Privy Council Officeon Monday, January 8, at 3 p.m.Present:Lord Curzon.Dr. Addison.Sir Albert Stanley.Sir Joseph Maclay. -Sir Maurice de Bunsen.Sir Norman Hill.Mr. S. H. Lever.Lord Curzon referred to the previous meeting of the Committee, at which the question as to what body should determine the nature of imports to be restricted was left undecided.   Lord Curzon suggested : 1. That an Interdepartmental Committee, composed of officials of the different Departments concerned, should be appointed to consider what articles are to be restricted.2.- That the Committee should sit daily for a given time.3. That the Interdepartmental Committee should report at the end of the period fixed to this Committee, who will in turn report to the War Cabinet.By this means two objects will be gained: in the first place, the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet will retain the authority of deciding the total amount of imports to be restricted, and, in the second place, the detailed work of examining the fist of different articles will be performed by officials of experience and knowledge of the subject.Sir Albert Stanley said that he was in complete accord with Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion. He added that, in his opinion, the chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee should be an independent man, not a permanent official. He suggested that the period for the work of examination should be a fortnight. He further suggested that immediate action might be taken in regard to cotton and timber.The Committee concurred in the suggestions of both Lord Curzon and Sir Albert Stanley.It was agreed that the President of the Board of Trade should ask Sir H. Babington Smith to act as chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee, which should be composed of representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, Ministry of Munitions, Treasury, Board of Trade, Foreign Office, India Office, and the Colonial Office, and Sir Norman Hill.After some discussion it was decided that the following instructions should be issued for the guidance of the Interdepartmental Committee : (1.) The Interdepartmental Committee to draw up two programmes : one showing a restriction of imports to the- amount of 250,000 tons per month; the other showing a restriction rising to 500,000 tons per month.(2.) The Interdepartmental Committee to be asked to sit de die in diem for a fortnight, or such shorter period as may be sufficient for their investigation.(3.) The Interdepartmental Committee to consider what articles are to be restricted and in what quantities, so as to make up the total amounts shown in (l.)(4.) The Interdepartmental Committee, upon which the Treasury will be repre-sented, to pay special attention to the Exchange aspect of the question.(5.) At the end of the examination the Interdepartmental Committee to make a report to Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee in the direction above indicated.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 8, 1917.VBIHTHD   AT THE .]?01ZEISJt OrFICS BT C.
