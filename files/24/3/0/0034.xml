SECRET. 11.-129.POSITION OF SHIPPING DURING 1917.Report by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton to the Shipping Controller.To Sir Joseph Maclay, Bart.,Shipping Controller, x Wellington House, Buckingham Gate, 8.W.,Sir, February 19, 1917.1. FOLLOWING upon our preliminary report of the 26th January, we now beg to submit the results of our first- investigation into the position of shipping during the year 1917.2. Our estimates are based primarily upon the commodities imported and tonnage entered, as recorded monthly in the &quot; Accounts relating to Trade and Navigation of the United Kingdom&quot; issued by the Board of Trade. We have taken as our starting point the imports and entrances for each month of 1916, and assuming that under unaltered conditions the volume of trade for the corresponding months of 1917 would be represented by the same figures, have calculated the changes due to all the factors producing variations of tonnage which have been reported to us. To some extent the monthly values assigned to the factors in question are hypothetical since they involve the future. The returns which we hope to obtain periodically will, however, place us in a position to Correct our assumptions up to date and to revise-and extend our forecast in any direction which changing experience may render necessary.2a. Our general scheme is thus to estimate the extent r f the losses and grains to mercantile trading which are expected to be met with in the course of the vear 1917, and finally to arrive at aggregate weight of commodities which cannot be carried in the vear. It should be ckarlv understood that in the investigation we have not brought into account any credit for expected reduction of imports due to restrictions already imposed (if such there he). We appreciate the importance of measuring the effect of such restrictive measures as have been or are about to be adopted, and this part of the subject we propose to take up in the next stage of our work. In considering the results which we submit, it will be necessary, therefore, to bear in mind that the saving of imports expected to be attained by action already taken is part of the saving which our conclusions show to he necessary, and is not additional thereto.We feel also that a certain benefit should be secured in 19.17 as compared with 1916, and particularly with the early months of 191(1, from the closer control of shipping which has been and is to be effected. This, of course, is a factor to which statistical weight cannot at present be given, though we may be able to include it in subsequent developments.3. In the present estimates we have brought under consideration changes from the 1916 experience, which may arise from the following causes :  Producing Reduction of Tonnage available for Imports.(a.) Net losses of British ships from war and marine risks, after allowing for replacement of losses by new ships at the rate of building prevailing in 1916.(&amp;..) Diminution of neutral entrances, whether arising from actual reduction of shipping or from diversion to other countries.(e.) Increase in the requirements of Russia,(d.) Increase-mainly for coal-in the requirements of Italy. 1328] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1917. . ,(
(e.) Provision of tonnage for railway material and rolling-stock for the army in France.(/.) Increase of imports for the Ministry of Munitions.(g.) Increase of imports for the War Office.(h.) Carriage of wheat from Australia.(?,) Possible increase of port and transit delays.Producing Increase of Tonnage available for Imports.(j.) Extension of the building programme.(k.) Purchase of neutral shipping, existing and new.(I.) Transfer of British shipping from abroad to ocean trade with the United Kingdom.4 It will be seen from our references herewith to the several items detailed in the last paragraph, that at the moment we attribute but little influence on the general situation to some of them. Other elements of variations than those included in the above list will no doubt arise, and will be dealt with as they are made known to us.5. In examining the operation of the above factors we deal generally with the ships of 1,600 gross tonnage and over, which represent the bulk of the ocean trade. Where, however, it is necessary to consider the position in regard to the smaller vessels we deal with it as far as the facts available permit.Loss Factors.(a.) Net Losses of British Ships.6. The statements, as at the end of each month prepared by the Admiralty Transport Department, give the total gross tonnage of British ships (passenger and cargo) on the last day of each month from June 1916 onwards.   Earlier than this date no complete returns appear to exist, but the returns of war losses which have been kept from the beginning of the war enable us to assess the net losses of gross tonnage for the first six months of 1916.   In the period July-December 19] 6 the war losses were 609,106 tons, and the net losses 499,725 tons.   From these figures wi propose to assume that the net losses in each of the months January-June 1916 wen five-sixths of the war losses of the corresponding months.   After January 1917 we must, of course, assume a hypothetical figure for each month.   For February, in view of the fact that in the first two weeks of the month the recorded net losses wen 43,189 tons, we assume a total for the month of 150,000 tons, thus assigning to the last two weeks of the month an equal loss to that experienced in the last two weeks of January.   For March and April caution suggests that higher figures should be assumed, namely, 200,000 tons in each month.   After April it appears admissible to assume that enemy submarine activities will be checked to some extent, and we have reduced the assumed net losses to 150,000 tons in Mav and to 100,000 tons in each month after May.7. We thus arrive at the following estimates of monthly net losses stated in thousands of tons (gross) : LosvS.	1916.	1917.January	55	175February	57	150March	77	200April           ..	113	200May	51	150June	26	100July	32	100August	72	100September	86	100October	102	100November	118	100December	82	100
8. Using the foregoing figures, we have prepared the following table showing the gross tonnage of British shipping at the end of each month from December 1916 onwards compared with the corresponding tonnage twelve months earlier : Month ending 	Gross Tonnage at End of Month.	Gross Tonnage at End of Month a Year previously.

It will be seen from the last table that, whereas the British tonnage existing on the Hist December, 1916, was 15,278,000, it is estimated that on the 31st December, 1917, it will have fallen to 13,7D3,()00. The reduction is equal to 103 per cent., or an average reduction throughout the year of, say, 5 per cent. This average reduction of the tonnage existing at a given date is of no value unless the carrying power throughout the year is estimated on the basis of the tonnage existing at the beginning of the year. We do not think that any practicable estimate of the tonnage entrances throughout the year could be made on this basis. Tonnage has been continuously diminishing throughout the whole period of hostilities, and in order to judge the importing capacity of successive months of any one year reference must be made to the tonnage existing in the corresponding month of the previous year. From this point of view, which is, we submit, the only correct one to take, the average net reduction of British tonnage throughout 1917 (subject to what we have said above as to the necessarily hypothetical character of the estimates as to&apos; the future) is nearly 9 per cent, of the corresponding tonnage of 1916.10. The figure last stated is based, it must be remembered, on total tonnage. The needs of the fighting forces do not admit of any reduction of the tonnage assigned to their service, unless owing to port delays or other reasons there is a leakage which is capable of remedy. The reduction of the tonnage available for civilian requirements is necessarily a much larger figure, and we estimate it (taking into account certain other relevant factors) at about 17 per cent. This refers only to British shipping. As we shall proceed to show, a loss of neutral tonnage to at least the same extent has to be provided for.11. It is necessary to convert the estimated loss of tonnage shown in paragraph 8 into loss of tonnage entrances in each month of 1917. We have reason to believe, as a result of calculations to be explained later (see paragraph 30 below), that the average number of entrances which the vessels of over 1,600 gross tonnage make into the United Kingdom in the course of a year is 3*4. This may be held to indicate that of the tonnage engaged in the import trade at the end of each month, 28 per cent, will make an entrance into a United Kingdom port within the next following month. If, therefore, the tonnage engaged in import at the end of a given month is x tons less than the corresponding tonnage a year previously, 28 per cent, of x will be lost to the tonnage entrances in the next month as compared with the entrances recorded twelve months earlier. The figures in the last column of the table in paragraph 8 have therefore to be multiplied by -28, and when further multiplied by yf they show the effective loss of net tonnage entrances as compared with the corresponding month of 1916, which is the form to which all variations must be converted in order to make use of the monthly trade and navigation accounts. The figures of net loss of tonnage entrances so obtained are subject to a reduction of 6f per cent, to eliminate tonnage of passenger vessels not available for cargo (see paragraph 35 below), and as thus adjusted are carried to the summary appended to this report..12- In addition to the losses among vessels of over 1,600 gross tonnage, continuous reduction of tonnage has occurred among the smaller vessels, and this, while not a
large item in the aggregate, is proportionately the more serious that many of these smaller vessels, being engaged in foreign trade either within the home trade limits or with relatively near countries outside those limits, make a considerably greater number of entrances in the course oil a year than do the larger vessels. We find that in the twenty-seven months, October 1914-Deceinber 1916, 110 small trading vessels were lost, representing a gross tonnage of 128,000. Of these, however, 73 vessels, repre-senting a tonnage of 67,703, were lost in the year 1916, this representing a monthly loss of over 5,600 tons (gross) a month. These vessels make, we estimate, an average of eight entrances a year; and after adjusting the figures, therefore, for marine losses&quot;and for replacements, and for the exclusion of tonnage of passenger vessels not available for cargo, we conclude that the effective reduction of netvtonnage entrances during 1917 due&quot;to the loss of small vessels will be 20,000 tons a month. This figure is also carried to the Summary.(b.) Reduction of Neutral Tonnage Entrances.13. The reduction under this head must be estimated on a different basis from that employed in the case of British shipping. Neutrals are free to trade in all parts of the world, and an estimate based merely upon losses, and disregarding diversions of shipping from trade with the United Kingdom, whether due to submarine risks or world freight conditions, would be fallacious, The only practicable course is, in fact, to make a general estimate of the probable loss of entrances in each month, based to some extent upon past experience, but taking into consideration also the new factors wdiich have come into operation.14. We find that in 1916 the total net tonnage entrances of neutral shipping* were 9,831,404 tons, as against 10,862,166 tons in 1915. The reduction for the whole year was thus 9^- per cent. But in the first two months of 1916 the entrances were 10 per cent, greater than in the corresponding period of 1915; between March and August the losses were 9  per cent., and in the last four months of the year they were 17 per cent. Matters were thus getting progressively worse during 1916. In Jauuary 1917 the reduction, compared with January 1916, was 16 per cent., and we presume that, in the known circumstances, a large addition to this figure must be looked for in regard to February and March. We have assumed, therefore, that the reduction of neutral entrances will be equal in February to 33 per cent, of the entrances of February 1916; in March, to 25 per cent, of the entrances of March 1916; am! in each month, of 1917 ihereafter to 20 per cent, of the entrances for the corresponding month of 19.16. The figures thus obtained, aud aggregating a loss of entrances of over 2,000,000 tons net, are reduced by 5 per cent, to eliminate the non-cargo capacity of passenger vessels before being carried to the Summary.&quot;15. In connection with this subject we have considered the possibility of an increase in the available shipping owing to enemy ships in neutral ports coming, into trade as a result of the resentment excited by the recent German declarations. According to articles in the press, the enemy tonnage locked up is substantial, but it would be unlikely that all of it would become available to trade or that the part becoming available would all come to the United Kingdom. While, therefore, we might receive some assistance from this source before the end of 1917, it does not seem possible to make a definite estimate until matters have developed further.(c.) The Russian Programme.16. We have received a statement showing (a) the tonnage required to supply the full amount of munitions aud coal asked for by Russia; and (b) the full amount of munitions and the same amount of coal as last year. WTe have compared the requirements for 1917 with what happened in 1916, and after making allowance for return cargo (which may be taken as not more than last year), &amp;c, we conclude, on a general review of the situation that the loss in shipping may be taken as 2,728 vessels for one week under (a) or 817 under (6). These figures represeut total losses in 1917 of about 604,000 and 169,000 net tonnage entrances respectively and the iarser of these losses [i.e., that incidental to the fulfilment of the whole programme) is entered in the summary and distributed over the appropriate months, in explanation of the gains in tonnage under this head at the end of the year it may he mentioned that the shipping has been arranged this year so that the cargoes &quot;to Russia are* In using- the convenient term &quot; neutral shipping,&quot; we have included such allied tonnage as enters British ports.
carried at earlier dates. If delays take place the distribution will be altered, but unless the derangement is considerable we do not expect the total loss above named to be exceeded.(d.) Goal for Italy.17. The demands for coal for Italy have increased considerably, but after discharge in&quot;- coal at Italian ports the vessels will be available for importing goods to the United KitWom on the return journey, and there is therefore no decrease in import from this cause to be taken into account.(e.) Tonnage for Railway Material, &amp;c, for France.18. There is an increased demand for railway material for the Expeditionary Force in France, which means the continuous use of about 50,000 net tons of shipping. This tonnage would not have made its next entrance in the ordinary course imme-diately, and we show the corresponding loss of tonnage entrances from February-onwards throughout the year, sf.) Increased Requirements of the Ministry of Munitions.19. We have asked for a return of the imports of 1916, but this is not yet completed. In the circumstances we have assumed that increased shipments during 1917 will be made to the extent of 1,000,000 tons weight as compared with 1916. We assume that of this class of imports about 200 tons will be carried to each 100 net tons of shipping.(g.) Increase of Imports for the War Office.20. From returns supplied to us by the War Office Contracts Departments^ we estimate that, exclusive of foodstuffs and timber, the War Office requirements will absorb 260,000 net tonnage entrances in 1917. As to foodstuffs, we presume that direct shipment to France, &amp;c, will be increased correspondingly with the increase of the army. This, however, does not involve an increase of supply (since the increase of the army abroad means a reduction of the population to be maintained within the United Kingdom), unless the military use of commodities on active service abroad is less economical than military and civilian use at home.Id regard to timber we understand that the requirements of the army will be at least as great in 1917 as in 1916, but as the Restriction of Imports Committee has this item under consideration we do not think it necessary to estimate for any increase in the quantity carried for military servicei.) Wheat from Australia.21. We understand that, as compared with 1916, an additional import of wheat from Australia, amounting to 810,000 tons (dead weight) in the spring of 1917, should lie allowed for. We assume that this represents 400,000 net tons, of shipping, and on the lurther assumption that the round voyage will occupy five months as against two months (on average) taken by the North American shipments, Ave conclude that net tonnage entrances amounting to 600,000 tons will be lost on this account. This loss ias to be distributed over the months January-May, the maximum loss in any one month amounting to 195,000 tons of entrances falling in April. These details are difficult to assess with any precision, but this is of little importance, as the whole item is relatively certain.(&apos;-) Port and Transit Belays.22. Vve have not provided for any increase of loss of tonnage under this head. We refer in a later paragraph to the importance of the subject in connection with measures for economising tonnage.PROFIT FACTORS. -) Extension of the Building Programme.28. We understand that it is expected to secure new tonnage (gross) to the amount of 750,000 tons during the year 1917.   Of this amount about 450.000 is [328j &apos; C
allowed for in arriving at the net Josses dealt with in (a) above. The balance oi 300,000 tons (gross) may be regarded as producing net tonnage entrances increasitio from 20,000 in or about March to 80,000 in December. The detailed amounts of new tonnage entrances thus arrived at are included in the Summary.(k.) Purchases of Neutral Shipping.24. Whe understand that it is hoped to acquire 500,000 tons (gross) of new shipping from foreign countries in the year. This, we have calculated, will produce net tonnage entrances increasing from ;^0,000 tons in or about March to lz0,000 tons in December. We understand further that an attempt will be made to secure a similat quantity of existing neutral shipping. It does not appear probable that this will result in any marked increase of tonnage entrances, and we have preferred, as a matter of precaution, to assume that its main effect will be to check the decline of neutral trade with the United Kingdom. We have had this point in view in assessing the loss under (b) above.(1.) Transfer of British Shipping from Abroad.25. Prom details of present negotiations which have been supplied to us, wt estimate that a new credit, beginning with 40,000 tons of entrances in April and increasing to 70,000 tons a month from September, will be derived from this source. We have felt it necessary to guard ourselves against any expectation of a lar^ accretion to United Kingdom trade from transfers of British shipping, as any consider-able movement in this direction might deflect neutral tonnage to the part of the world from which the British ships were taken.Summary of Losses and Gains.20. Our Summary shows for the year a total loss to merchandise of net tonnasjt entrances amounting to 6,852,000 tons, and against this s;ains amounting t 1,710,000 tons.There is thus a net loss to merchandise of 5,142,000 tons. This loss is distributed unevenly over the year, the maximum (597,000 tons) being in March, and tk minimum (194,000 tons) in December. The decrease towards the end of the year is clearly due to the facts that the building and purchase programme become mow effective as the year advances, and the Russian and Australian wheat programmes will have been worked out. In interpreting these figures it should be borne in mind thai columns (e), (f), and (g) of the Summary represent a transfer of shipping from mercantile to Government services, and not an actual loss of shipping. This would vitiate a. dire.-: comparison of our total losses in tonnage entrances with those shown for the several months of 1917 in the Board of Trade returns.The Average Duration of Voyages.27. It will be convenient at this stage to investigate the question of the average dura-tion of voyages of vessels engaged in the import trade, the accurate determination of which is essential to a correct estimate of the strain of tonnage losses on carrying capacity The average duration of the voyage is most directly obtained by dividing the net tonnage at work into the net tonnage entrances (after making necessary adjustment&apos; in each case), but it can also be found by examining the shipping index and tabulating&apos; the entrances of a large number of ships. In order that no possible check upon our work shall be neglected we have used both methods.28. To ascertain the tonnage at work in the import trade we have analysed the monthly returns prepared by the Admiralty Transport Department. The return foi January 3917 shows a total gross tonnage of 15,102,968 for vessels of 1,600 gross tonnage and over. Of this, however, a large proportion is requisitioned for the JNav; and War Office, and a further considerable proportion is requisitioned for Australia New Zealand, India, and the Allies. There appears to be an impression that tin wdtole of these vessels are in the same position as those trading on behalf of thi Colonies and Allies, viz., totally lost to British trade. We are satisfied that such is not tin case. A certain proportion of the requisitioned ships referred to are, speaking broad! and allowing for exceptions, lost to the export trade, but are available and are use( for import work; being, indeed, in this respect in the same position as the vessel carrying sugar, ore, wheat, &amp;c, in January, which obviously will make tonnage entrances into the United Kingdom.   We have tried various methods of estimatiBi
the total tonnage which is employed for imports (however it may be engaged other-wise), and have come to the conclusion that the only way to arrive at a safe figure is to investigate the work of the vessels requisitioned for the Navy, the War Office, Erance, Italy, and Russia, and to separate from the total those which are in fact in mercantile service at one period of the year or another. This we have done, with the following results : The tonnage of vessels (passenger and cargo) requisitioned for the Navy, the War Office, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Allies, or employed in carrying wheatto France-and Italy, or trading for the Allies or the colonies is         ..         .. 5,929,225But of these the &quot; part-time &quot; class represents ..          ..        ...          ..          .. 950,710Leaving as permanently withdrawn from mercantile service       ... .. .. 4,978,515To these we must add the vessels permanently abroad and those building, the total gross tonnage of which (allowing for the fact that vessels permanently abroadare somewhat smaller than the average) we estimate to be   .. .. .. 2,425,000The total gross tonnage not in the import traffic of the United Kingdom is therefore 7,403,515 The total gross tonnage shown by the Monthly Statement being .. .. ..     15,102,968There is working in the import traffic .. .. .. .. ..      7,699,453or rather more than 51 per cent. This last figure is of speciaMiuportance.29. To get the net tonnage which is to be divided into the net tonnage entrances for 1916, as explained in paragraph 27 above, we should work upon the yross tonnage existing at the end of June 1916. Taking 51 per cent, of this figure, converting it into net tonnage and eliminating the non-cargo tonnage of the passenger vessels (as to which see paragraph 35 below), we arrive at a mean net tonnage on import work of 4,690,000 tons.30. The net tonnage entrances (British) in 1916 were 20,214,309 tons, but this figure must be reduced by two items. The first of these is the tonnage entrances of small vessels; after a careful survey of this distinct and complicated problem we estimate these at 14 per cent, of the total, or (say) 2,830,000 tons. The second adjusting item is the tonnage entrances representing the non-cargo capacity of passenger vessels.. This, allowing for four entries a year in the case of these boats (a figure which is above the average for all vessels of which we are in search, but which is suggested by actual investigation) represents 1,350,000 tons entrances. The total deduction to be made from the net tonnage entrances of the year for the purpose in hand is thus 4,180,000, leaving a balance of say 16,000,000 tons. Dividing this by the mean net tonnage at work during the year (4,690,000, see paragraph 29 above) gives an average of 3&quot;4 entrances a year.31. We stated in paragraph 27 that we had investigated this question by actual inspection of the Transport Department Shipping Index and tabulation of the records of a large number of vessels. The period covered was the eight months May-December 1916. The number of ships dealt with was: passenger boats, 275 ; and cargo boats, 747. The average number of entrances a year was : passenger boats, 3 9; cargo boats, 3*3 ; or, taking them together, and reducing the passenger boats to their equivalent in cargo vessels, an average of 3*4, thus confirming completely the results brought out by the more detailed calculation.-32. An average of 3*4 entries a year means that, taking one month with another, 28 per cent, of all. the trading vessels make an entry to the United Kingdom every month and it means, therefore, that where a loss of shipping has been sustained the tonnage entrances of every month will be reduced by 28 per cent, of that loss.Weight of Goods carried by each 100 Net Tonnage.33. The monthly returns of the Board of Trade give the quantities and values of goods imported and the net tonnage entrances. In times of peace these sets of figures form a good basis of comparison, but during the war the goods imported are&quot; less than the true figure owing to the exclusion of certain goods consigned to Govern-ment, and the entrances are less than the true figure owing to the exclusion of entrances by ships having only Government cargo (other than food and grain). In the first place, therefore, we made careful enquiry with regard to the error which can be corrected by leaving the entrances unaltered and adding to the cargo all goods other than food and grain brought on Government account as part cargoes. It is difficult to obtain the figure with accuracy, but pending the receipt of a statement which is [328] &apos; D
t::&apos; t 8being prepared for us by the Ministry of Munitions, we think that it can reasonably be taken as 1,500,000 tons for 191(5.&apos;34. The Board of Trade returns give quantities in various terms, and they have to be reduced to tons before they can be considered; the result may be summarised as follows: Tons.(1.) Food, drink, and tobacco     .. .. .. ..    15,381,000(2.) Raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured       .. ..   22,340,000(3.) Manufactured articles . &apos;       ... .. ... ..     4,304,000(4.) Miscellaneous        .. .. ... .. ... 75,0.0.042,100,000Adding in respect of goods on Government account (mainly Ministryof Munitions) .&apos;. .. .. .. .. ..     1,500,000The total becomes .. ..   43,600,000This figure may be taken as an approximation to the weight of goods corre-sponding to the net tonnage entrances given in the Board of Trade returns, which are as follows: Tons.British .. .. .. .. ..   20,214,30!)   .Foreign .. .. .. .. .. .. ..     9,831,404Total   .. .. .. ..     &apos;   ..   30,045,713The two sets of figures imply that each 100 tons net of shipping carried 145 tons of cargo, but another complication arises owing to the insertion in the net tonnage entrances of the total net tonnage of a passenger ship, which carried a far smaller proportion of cargo than a cargo vessel of the same size. An adjustment could be avoided if we felt sure that war and marine risks and naval and military requirements will reduce the two classes of vessels available for commercial use in equal proportions. The danger in ignoring this point can be seen by taking an extreme case and assuming that all the cargo vessels had to he taken for military purposes; we should then assume that the balance of shipping was worth 145 tons of cargo for each net ton of shipping, but should find in practice that a far smaller amount would be carried. In order to investigate the question, Sir Kenneth Anderson made enquiries from shipping lines with regard to the carrying capacity of passenger liners, and as a result of an analysis of the figures he obtained we conclude that those passenger liners still in commercial use are worth, from a cargo-carrying point of view, two-thirds of their nominal net tonnage.35. The next part of the investigation is therefore to deduct the non-cargo part of the tonnage entrances of passenger vessels from the total tonnage entrances; this deduction for 1916 is about 1,350,0.00, or 6f- per cent, of British entrances. a deduction must also be made from foreign entrances, and we have deducted a some-what smaller figure (5 per cent.); the result is as follows :- Net tonnage entrances British   .. .. ..        ... .. .. .. ..     20.21-1,309Foreign .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       9,8S1,40430,045,7131,350,000 490,000 ---      1,840,00028,205.713Dividing this into the weight of cargo carried, we have that each 100 tons of net tonnage carried 155 tons of cargo. -36. The figure of 145 tons gives the average weight carried by each 100 net tons of shipping actually entered in the Board of Trade returns. The figure of 155 tons gives the average weight carried by each 100 net tons of shipping available for carrying cargo and entered in the returns,.Summary of Shipping Losses expressed in Terms of Weight of Commodities.37. The final column of our Summary shows the reduction in weight of imports corresponding to the loss of ship tonnage. The figures show a total of nearly 8,000,000 tons of commodities, made up of amounts which vary from month to month for the reasons indicated in paragraph 20. A loss is shown for January 1917, which has already been incurred, and must have been met partly by a reduction of stocks and partly byDeduct for non-cargo capacity of passenger vessels  BritishForeign .. .. &quot;...
anv restriction of import which has already taken place. It should he understood, as explained in paragraph 2 (a), that we have pot taken credit in our estimates for the effect of any curtailment of imports already arranged. These must, of course, be brought into&apos;account against the deficiency that Ave show.Restriction of Imports.. 38. We understand that an immediate restriction of imports is to be made. As to this Ave feel it necessary to point out that a restrictive policy adopted now will only effect the imports for about eight months of the present.year because goods just shipped will be unaffected, If, therefore, the total year&apos;s shortage of shipping is equivalent, as we suggest, to a reduction of imports by 8,000,000 tons, the greater part of this deficiency has to be made good by measures operating over eight months only.The Position in 1918.39. We should, Ave feel, lay stress also on the fact that the position in 1918 cannot be estimated immediately from the results of our present work. The losses during 1^17 will, on the one hand, further reduce the carrying capacity of the mercantile shipping as compared vrith 1916, Avhile, on the other hand, the accretion from purchases and the expansion of the building programme will in 1918 produce their full effect. The situation as to that year has to be Avorked out, effect being given in the calculations to the recurrence of any of the special items of 1917, e.g., the Prussian programme, and special caution is needed lest unwarrantably favourable inferences as to 1918 should he.drawn from the improvement shoAvn in the Summary towards the end of 1917.40. The figures given in this report show that we anticipate a most serious decline in the amount of imports for general use, and it is clear that efforts must be made in every direction to economise tonnage. In this connection the folloAving remarks on specific points may be mentioned : (1.) Shortened Length of Voyage-It is an economy in tonnage to bring com-modities over the shortest distance, thus if we can eliminate or reduce voyages to and from (say) the Ear East and Australia, taking five or six months, and replace them by voyages from (say) Canada or United States of America, taking about two months, a vessel becomes two and a half times more valuable. In other words, while 50,000 net tonnage of shipping coming from great distances would produce only 110,000 tonnage entrances it would produce 275,000 tonnage entrances from shorter distances or an increase probably at least 250,000 in tons weight, of commodities, or munitions. On the other hand, there are possibilities of increased delay owing to lengthened voyages in attempts to avoid submarines or raiders.(2.) Expedition at Ports. This is another way in which a great saving of tonnage can he effected. A saving of five days a A^oyage would increase the tonnage entrances and imports by 5 per cent, in respect of commercial vessels (2,000,000 in tons weight of imports), and as it would also mean economy in the A^essels in use for the Navy and Army, their future demands would automatically be reduced. In this connection we should remark that if the shortening of voyages indicated, in (1) above meant more crowded ports, the profit from the action taken in one direction would be discounted by the loss of efficiency in the other.(3.) Economy in Tonnage by the War Services. We have assumed that as much as possible is being, and will be done in this direction, but so serious does the general position seem that it is advisable to make reference to economy, eAren where it seems unlikely that saving can be effected. The conclusion of the East African campaign might possibly release some shipping to other military work, and so indirectly benefit the import trade.41. In conclusion, we think it neeessary to point out that, Avhile we have necessarily worked from the tonnage entrances of 1916, we do not expect that the losses calculated by us will be realised exactly as they are shown, month by month, in the Summary. The tonnage entrances vary from one month to another to a much greater extent than might be anticipated, and no doubt the monthly entrances of 1917 will vary from those of 1916, quite apart irom the special conditions which are affecting the position. We have no reason to think, however, that taking several months together the results realised will be other than we have estimated.&apos; &quot;We are, &amp;c.ALFRED W. WATSON. W. PALIN ELDERTON.
