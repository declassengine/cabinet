Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1917.MAMMOTH SHIPS.Memorandum by Lord Curzon.ON tbe 25th April I was asked by the War Cabinet inter alia to &quot; decide the question of building &apos; unsinkable &apos; mammoth ships.&quot;I have had personal interviews with representatives of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping and with Lord Pirrie, and have found that there is a great deal to be said on both sides.On the one hand, there is a strong feeling against building mammoth ships. This was expressed to me by the members of Sir Joseph Maclay&apos;s Committee, and may be summed up briefly as follows : 1. Material.The amount of steel (from 16,000 to 18,000 tons) required for the construction of one mammoth ship would be sufficient for eight standard ships.2. TimeA mammoth ship takes at least fourteen months in building, a standard ship about four and half months.3. Quays and Docks.There are very -few ports with accommodation for so big a ship, and only three graving-docks (Liverpool, Southampton, and Belfast).4. Disability in Handling Cargo.The same carrying capacity is not obtainable in the mammoth ship as in her equivalent in standard ships, because of delay in loading and discharging the bigger ship. The Shipping Committee estimate that she would take a month to load, and therefore they feel that it would be better tc lose a percentage of eight &quot; standards.&quot;5. Risk from Submarines.The Committee are strongly and unanimously of opinion that the mammoth, as designed, will not turn out to be unsinkable. They think that she would be relentlessly pursued and attacked by the enemy, that if hit by torpedo or by mines in either of the engine rooms, and still more in both, she would sink ; if hit elsewhere she would have to be towed into harbour, that she would require to be specially convoyed, and that the experiment would prove to be an expensive failure.They maintain, that the standard ships (of 8,000 tons deadweight each) as compared with larger or smaller vessels offer the maximum division of risk consistent with early delivery.On the other hand there are the views of the Admiralty and Lord Pirrie, in favour of the large ship.1. Risk from Submarines.As I think the Cabinet are aware, the Admiralty view is that the mammoth ship is practically unsinkable.  -Lord Pirrie shares this opinion. He thinks that she could be hit by mines, or by three, or even four torpedoes in either or both engine rooms, without being sunk. She would be saved by her &quot; double skin &quot; construction, and she would have no side lights except on the upper deck.[551]SECRET. &quot;G.-147.
2. Quays and Docks.No difficulty is anticipated in the small number of ports that could accommodate the ship because New York, Boston, Portland, Quebec, and Halifax on the other side of tbe Atlantic; and Liverpool, Southampton, and Belfast on this side are all that are likely to be required. She could be loaded or unloaded either in the open river or at any quay of sufficient size.8. Economy in Personnel.The big ship would offer great economies in officers and crews as compared with eight &quot; standards.&quot;4. Economy in Convoys.There would also be a saving in convoys which would merely be required in the danger zone. Elsewhere, her speed, which would be far greater than that of the ordinary ship, would be a sufficient protection.To sum up : To the Admiralty the building of the mammoth ships appears as a necessity; to Lord Pirrie as a legitimate experiment; to the Ministry of Shipping as little short of a freak.After hearing and weighing all the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that it would Joe difficult for the Government, in the light of information supplied by their advisers on naval construction, to justify the refusal to proceed with the building of a vessel which they are told is practically unsinkable, and which may, if successful, provide a model that will he of permanent value, not only in the present war, but hereafter.I therefore recommend that an order be placed with Messrs. Harland and Wolff at Belfast to start at once upon the construction of a mammoth ship, as designed by the Admiralty, using the keel already laid down, but unfinished, of a big merchant ship 800 feet long, referred to in G.T.-539.For this purpose, 3,000 tons of steel approximately the amount required for one standard ship should be allocated during the twelve weeks after June, this being the amount of material needed for the construction of the bottom of the ship. A start should also be made upon building the engines.-I would point out to the War Cabinet that should some event, at present unforeseen, have happened by the end of that time, such as our mastery of the sub-marine danger or the imminent conclusion of the war, which might induce the Government to abandon the construction of the ship, it would not be too late to with-draw from the venture.The cost, as estimated by Lord Pirrie, would by then have been approximately  3,000 tons of steel at 12/. a ton ... ...       36,000Cost of taking over present keel and foundation ... 10,000 Engines    ... ... ... ... ...        20,000Say       ... ... 66,000 It would, however, be possible to obtain credit forabout 50 per cent, of the steel, say ... 18,000And for the engines (which, being of a commercial and not Admiralty pattern, could be sold andfitted into another ship) ... ... ... 205000Sav       ... ...       38,000Or, in other words, a total net loss of about       ...        30,000Or it might even be possible to complete the ship and use her for the Admiralty as an oil carrier.These considerations of the ultimate disposal of the ship are, however, matters with which the War Cabinet are not immediately concerned.The next step should be, in my opinion, to place the order promptly, so that the work on the mammoth ship may be started as soon as possible.
It may be asked why, if it is advisable to build one mammoth ship as a form of insurance, is it not also advisable to build several vessels of the same type? The answer is that there is a slip available for a big ship at Belfast, and the keel is already laid down; but more especially because in Ireland, and in Ireland alone, there is, I am informed, both sufficiency of labour and freedom from labour troubles in the shipyards.  About 1,000 men would probably be employed upon the construction.Taking the various factors of Labour, Material, and shipyard facilities into consideration, it appears that Belfast is the place best suited for the building of the Mammoth Ship.There are other slips in Great Britain on which mammoth ships could be built, but having regard to Labour shortage, I have not recommended their use.&quot;When the first mammoth ship is launched in about seven months&apos; time from the date of commencement it will be for the Government to determine whether another similar vessel should be laid down in the slip set free.QUEZON of KEDLESTON.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W., April 30, 1917.
