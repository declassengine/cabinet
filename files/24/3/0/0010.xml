3ASIA MINOR.Note by Lord Milner.IN the course of a very long interview which I had with Baron Sonnino on Monday, the 8th January, he raised this question without my having previously referred to it, aud explained his point of view at some length. He narrated fairly enough the previous history, with which we are all familiar, and said that he thought Italy had just cause to complain of the way she had been treated in the matter, though he did not think that there had been any deliberate intention to place her in a disadvantageous position, certainly not on the part of England. But he went on to sav lie was most anxious not to engage in recrimination^ or to dwell upon the past. His sole object was now, as soon as possible die specially emphasised the. danger of delay \ to get the question settled in a manner which would put Italy in a more favourable, position, when the wdiole story c&apos;ame out, than she was at present.It was quite likely, he thought, that none of our aspirations as regards Asia Minor could in fact be realised, or realised in full. It was more or less an ideal programme ; but even in such a programme Italy ought to have her fair share. He was surprised that England had given Alexandretta to France, but that was England&apos;s business.What interested Italy most was the question of the outlet to the sea by way of Adana and Mersina, as the Konia hinterland would be almost valueless without it. I was careful to avoid discussing the details of the possible agreement, but, as far as I could gather without going into them, he did not care so very much about Smyrna  certainly not as much as about Adalia and the coast opposite the Dodecannese.With regard to the method of bringing about a solution of the question, I asked him whether he approved of London as a place of conference, and whether we might hope that he would come to it himself. He said he would like to have it settled in London, and was prepared to come himself, but only provided that there had been some previous discussion, holding out a hope of a settlement, as it would only make matters worse if there was to be a formal conference resulting in a failure to come to any agreement.Various methods of advancing the solution of the question were discussed. He appeared favourable to the idea that there should be, in the first instance, an informal discussion in London between the Ambassadors of Italy, France, and Russia, and our Foreign Secretary. His hope evidently is that England will act as a mediator between France and Italy in the matter, and bring some pressure to bear upon France, so that, when the matter finally comes out, it may appear as a fair deal, in which all the four Allied Bowers have received proportionate consideration. Anything else would, he felt sure, have a bad effect, not only upon the conduct of the war, but upon the relations of the Allied Powers afterwards.What he cared most about was the maintenance of the Entente even in peace. The recognition of Italy&apos;s claims in the Mediterranean (and she had practically no claims anywhere else ; she was a purely Mediterranean Power) was essential to this.I may add that in this, as in all.his remarks, Baron Sonnino was most friendly in his attitude to England, as well as very cordial to myself personally.-  (Initialled) M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 16, 1917.SECRET.
