RESTRICTION  OF IMPORTS.The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P.,Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.Sir,WE were appointed by the War Cabinet on the 21st December, 1916, &quot;to consider and report on the question of the Restriction of Imports.&quot; On the 9th January, 1917, we presented a preliminary report (G-105), in which it was shown that we had appointed an Interdepartmental Committee, composed of officials of the different Departments concerned, with instructions to prepare two alternative programmes, one&apos; showing a restriction of imports to the amount of 250,000 tons per month, the other showing a restriction rising to 500,000 tons per month.This Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Babington Smith, have now completed their investigation, and have presented to us a Report (of which a copy is attached) containing the two programmes for which we asked. In view of the state-ments made and the advice given by the Shipping Controller in regard to shortage of tonnage, we have deemed it desirable to recommend for general acceptance by the War Cabinet (subject to certain exceptions) the larger scale of restriction, namely, that involving reduction of imports to. the amount of 500,000. tons. It seems to us that no smaller programme will either release the shipping or attain the results that are desired.We have examined the sections of the Report seriatim, and have had the advantage of discussing it in detail with Sir Henry Babington Smith.Generally speaking, we concur in the recommendations contained in the Report of his Committee. We would like, however, to bring to your notice the following observa-tions with regard to some of the proposals : Section I. Paper and Paper-making Materials.In accepting the proposals of the Committee we suggest that the War Cabinet should without delay issue instructions as to : (a.) Stricter economy in consumption, especially in Government Departments. (6.) Collection of waste paper to be carried out by, or under the direction of, local authorities.Section U.--Timber.With regard to this section of the Report we have considered the advisability of creating a central authority to control timber supplies, and more particularly whether the powers should be vested in : -(a.) The Board of Agriculture.(6.) A New Department of Timber Controller.(c.) The War Office.The main objection to (a) is that the sphere of influence of the Board of Agriculture does not extend to Scotland or Ireland, or to France.The objections to [b) are those incidental to the creation of yet another Government Department.The reasons in favour of (c) are :  1. The War Office are by far the largest users of timber.2. Some of the forests in France, which it is proposed to fell, are within the zone of war, and therefore the work must be under the military authorities.3. The War Office has had wide experience in controlling supplies, e.g., wool and flax.4. The necessary labour must be in part military. We therefore recommend to the War Cabinet that: (a.) A Director of Timber Supplies should be appointed in the War Office. (6.) He should have an Interdepartmental Committee to assist him. (c.) The functions of the Home-grown Timber Committee and other existing authorities should be absorbed in the. new authority. [244-5]
With regard to obtaining supplies in France, we understand that there are political difficulties to be overcome, especially in the cases of forests where clear-felling will be necessary. In approaching the French Government it will be advisable, in our opinion, to base the arguments for felling in the main on the congested state of the &quot;French ports.Section HI.-Fooclstuffs and Feeding-stuffs.1. Raw Fruit and Vegetables.We concur in all the recommendations, except in the case of oranges, grapes, bananas, and onions, the importation. of which, in each case, we suggest should be reduced by 75 per cent. In S&apos;ime, if not in all, of these cases we may be compelled in the last resort, as. the result of protest or negotiation, to accept a smaller reduction. With a view to such eventuality it might be well to have something in hand.2. Luxuries.Here, again, we concur in all the recommendations, except as regards wine and brandy, which we recommend should be reduced by 75 per cent, in each case, instead of 50 per cent., partly because of the large stocks existing in this country, partly in deference to the considerations already named ; and canned fruits, the imports of which, owing to the fact that they constitute a popular article of consumption with the poorer classes, should, in our opinion, in no case be reduced by more than 50 per cent, of the 1916 imports.3. Cereals and Feeding-stuffs.With reference to the paragraphs dealing with brewing materials, we should like to see complete prohibition, but we concur with Sir H. Babington Smith&apos;s Committee in thinking that this may not be practicable. We therefore suggest that the War Cabinet should decide the precise additional reduction, whether 30 per cent, or a larger figure, that can be made (in augmentation of that already in operation) in the output of beer.Section IV.-Raw Materials and certain other Articles. Section V&apos;--^Manufactures. Section VI. Re-ex-ports. We concur in all the proposed restrictions.In endorsing the recommendation of Sir Henry Babington Smith&apos;s Committee, we fully realise that the proposed restrictions will raise difficult questions with our Dominions, our Allies, and some of the neutrals, and will, when carried into effect, assail and possibly even for the time being destroy a number of industrial interests in this country and abroad. We feel, however, that in no other way can the available amount of tonnage, now so seriously reduced, be made to meet the necessary demands made upon it. -We are also aware that, in order to preven t speculation and the creation of monopolies in articles that are arbitrarily reduced, it may he necessary to., control the prices of various commodities. This matter is referred to in the attached Report, in regard to the prices more particularly of tea, cocoa, and coffee. The question of con-trolling the price of food is one upon which we did not like to arrive at a conclusion in the absence of the Food Controller, but we are disposed to think that it will be necessary to extend the system over a wider area.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,CURZON of KEDLESTON, Chairman.CHRISTOPHER ADDISON.A.

TERMS   OF   REFERENCE.Committee of Imperial Defence,2, Whitehall Gardens, London, S. W., Sir, January 9, 1917.I AM directed by Lord Curzon to state, for tbe information of the President of the Board of Trade, that the Restriction of Imports Committee, appointed by the War Cabinet on the 21st December, have decided that it is necessary to set up an Inter-departmental Committee, composed of officers from the different Departments, to examine what articles should be prohibited or restricted.Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee will therefore be -glad if the President of the Board of Trade will be kind enough to appoint a representative to serve on the Interdepartmental Committee.The Committee think that it will be convenient here to state, for the guidance of the Interdepartmental Committee, the following instructions : 1. The Interdepartmental Committee to draw up two programmes one showing a restriction of imports to the amount of 250,000 tons per month, the other showing a restriction rising to 500,000 tons per month.2. The Interdepartmental Committee to be asked to sit de die in diem for a -  fortnight, or such shorter period as may be sufficient for their investigation.3. The Interdepartmental Committee to consider what articles are to be restricted, and in what quantities, so as to make up the total amounts shown in 1.4. The Interdepartmental Committee, upon which the Treasury will be represented, to pay special attention to the exchange aspect of tbe question.5. At the end of the examination the Interdepartmental Committee to make a report to Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee in the direction above indicated.A similar letter is being addressed to the Treasury, the Ministry of Munitions, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, India Office, War Office, Admiralty, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry-of Shipping.I am, Sir,- Your obedient Servant,CLEMENT JONES.The Permanent Secretaryof the Board of Trade,Whitehall, S.W.[244-5]b

REPORT  OF  THE  INTERDEPARTMENTAL   COMMITTEE  ONIMPORT   RESTRICTIONS.To the Right Honourable Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E. My Lord,WE have the honour to refer to your letter of the 9th January directing us to draw up two programmes, one showing a restriction of imports to the amount of 250,000 tons per month, the other showing a restriction rising to 500,000 tons per month. We were instructed also to pay special attention to the exchange aspect of the question.The terms of our reference excluded the examination of the data upon which the figures of 250,000 tons and 500,000 tons per month are based. We have, therefore, not enquired as to the extent of the restrictions necessary, or as to the modifications in the situation produced by events which have occurred since the Committee was appointed.2. The principles which we have endeavoured to apply in detail may be defined as follows : (i.) We must continue to import in sufficient quantity all things necessary directly and indirectly for war purposes, in so far as they cannot be produced, or are not already in stock, in this country.(ii.) We must continue to import in sufficient quantity the necessaries of life for the civil population, in so far as they cannot be produced or are not already in stock in this country, and all things indispensable for the production, manufacture, and distribution of such necessaries.(hi.) It is very desirable from the point of view of exchange to continue to import the raw material of the manufactures which we export.(iv.) It is very desirable from the point of view of exchange to exclude manufactured articles which are not indispensable for the above purposes, or which, if indispensable, can be produced in this country.(v.) Exclusion is specially advantageous from the tonnage point of view in the case of those articles which are heavy (weight being in most cases more important than bulk), especially if they are brought from great distances; from the exchange point of view, in the case of those articles which have a high value, and in particular those which are imported from countries where the exchange problem is specially difficult, as the United States.(vi.) It is also desirable, for reasons of practical advantage and also of public sentiment both in this and other countries, to exclude articles of luxury, even if their value and tonnage are not large. The import of luxuries, besides leading directly to extravagance in expenditure, . makes it more difficult to insist on economy in more necessary articles, and also indisposes Allied and neutral countries to assent to import prohibitions which are injurious to their interests.3. Even in the case of necessaries, the present rate of consumption leaves in some cases a margin for economy. Whether such economy is possible or not. home products or accumulated stocks should be employed wherever possible in place of imported products, thereby saving tonnage and benefiting exchange. The most important product for such substitution is timber, to which we call particular attention in our Report.4. In cases where a product is imported from more than one country it is evident that, if port facilities are equal, tonnage is economised if it is brought from the nearer country rather than the more distant one.A similar consideration applies where a product brought from a distant country can be replaced by another product of similar use and equivalent value from a nearer country.Thus it is clearly advantageous from the tonnage point of view to import wheat from North America rather than from Australia or India, and oleaginous produce from West Africa rather than from Manchuria.There are,- however, other considerations which may tell in the opposite direction. [244-5] &quot; B
In particular, considerations of exchange make it desirable to reduce as much as possible the imports from North America. These considerations have an important bearing on some of our recommendations; but as they have recently been fully before the Government in connection with the wheat imports we do not enter into further detail. Important savings of effective tonnage have been, and can be, effected by economy in the length of voyages ; but we have not made any allowance for such savings in our estimates.5. There are important considerations of a different character which limit the application of the principles stated above. Products which, on those principles, it would be desirable to exclude or restrict are, in many cases, imported from countries within the British Empire. Such cases are fruit from Canada, Australia, and South Africa ; canned fish from Canada; tea from India and Ceylon; ostrich feathers from South Africa. The Governments interested may raise very natural objections to the injury involved to private interests and to financial strength.Similar objections are made by the Governments of Allied countries, both in the case of unmanufactured products, such as fruit and marble from Italy, and, particularly, in the case of valuable manufactures, such as silks from France and Japan. It is impossible to deny the cogency of the reasons put forward by these countries, since they are similar to those which compel us to use every effort to maintain our export trade.Certain undertakings have already been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, both to the Dominions and the Allies; and in the case of France there is a reciprocal arrangement for the free licensing of imports into the one country from the other in cases where a prohibition exists.We recognise, therefore, that there may be difficulty in securing the wmole of the reductions which we recommend, but it is clear that the full reduction required cannot be realised if any large concessions are made. In the case of prohibitions affecting to any serious extent the interests of any of the Dominions or of India, it will be necessary to communicate with the Governments concerned before the prohibitions affecting them are put in force, and similarly with the Allied Governments. Howr far it will be possible to maintain the full restrictions against the objections which must be anticipated it is not for us to say, but it is essential that action should not be delayed by prolonged negotiation.6. Similar difficulties arise also in the case of neutral countries. Some can retaliate by stopping the export of products which are indispensable to us (e.g., pyrites, iron ore, quicksilver, and copper from Spain). In other cases the stoppage of manufactures or produce at present sent to us might create valuable supplies for Germany. There are numerous special agreements concluded for the furtherance of the blockade policy or for obtaining necessary supplies, and these in some instances preclude us from stopping particular imports.Neutral Governments also object if they receive less favourable treatment than Allies as regards admission of their exports, basing their remonstrances either on &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treaties or on more general grounds. The result is that con-cessions made to Allies tie our hands as regards neutrals. For instance, having agreed not to exclude cotton hosiery from Japan, w^e are unable to exclude the far larger import of similar goods from the United States. These difficulties are serious. We can only recommend that every effort should be made to surmount them.7. There is one other consideration which limits the action we propose. Regard must be had to the future of valuable trades centred in this country. If the advantage in tonnage or exchange arising from the curtailment of a particular import or the prohibition of a re-export is relatively small, and the future continuance of the trade would be endangered, we think that it should, if possible, be allowed to continue.II. Programme of Restriction.8. Having stated the general conditions of the problem, we proceed to tabulate in summary form the restrictions which we recommend in order to produce a total saving of 250,000 or 500,000 tons.The figure given for &quot; estimated, saving &quot; represents in each case the amount by which the average monthly import, when the restriction is fully effective, will fall below the average monthly import in 1916.-

The above figures represent the reduction of imports which will be produced when the restrictions proposed are fully effective.   It must be remembered, however, that: &apos;1. A certain amount of time most necessarily be lost in making prohibitions effective, since a quantity of the goods affected are in transit at the time of the prohibition. The exact rule to be applied in such cases should be settled by the licensing authority.   It should be as strict as practicable.2. In many cases, for seasonal or other reasons, the prohibitions will have effect mainly in the latter part of the year. &apos;3. In some cases there will be substitution of articles whose import is not restricted for those which are excluded or restricted.4. Some delay may be caused by discussions with the Dominions and Allied and neutral Governments.We also anticipate that some concessions may be unavoidable to meet the objec-tions of those Governments. On this ground, and also to allow for substitution, we have thought it necessary to reduce the above totals by an amount which can only be conjectural, but which we put at 25,000 tons a month.Moreover, in the limited time available for the examination of an extremely complex subject, it has not been possible for us to consult representatives of the trades affected. Such consultation will be necessary in many cases, and we recognise that some of our recommendations may have to be modified as the result of the more complete information thus obtained.10. After this deduction has been made there remains a deficiency of 72,000 tons per month, which must be made up in order to reach 500,000 tons. This can, in our opinion, be done most readily by a further saving in timber. The development of home supplies, in the United Kingdom and in Francs, for pit-timber and for military purposes is, as we explain in the section of our Report which deals with timber, almost entirely a
matter of labour, transport, and organisation, and we believe that the required saving-of shipping can be effected in no other way by the employment of so few men. If a sufficient labour force can be supplied, we believe that tbe saving, which we bad estimated at 200,000 tons could be increased by a further 50,000 tons per month, or even more. &quot;&apos;*11. If, however, the labour or transport required for this purpose cannot be made available, it will be necessary to have recourse to foodstuffs.The above totals have been reached without reducing the supply of staple foods and feeding-stuffs. They represent, as regards food, the cutting off or reduction of items which, though in many cases useful, cannot be regarded as in any sense indispensable, or as contributing materially to the maintenance and efficiency of the population.In order to reach the larger total required, it will be-necessary to restrict not merely non-essential but essential foods or feeding-stuffs. The dangers attending any such proposals are obvious. It is a matter primarily for the Food Controller and the Agricultural Departments, who, we understand, are giving full consideration to this aspect of the question.12. The lower scheme of restrictions which we have formulated gives a total saving of 330,000 tons per month after making the same allowance as in the higher scheme for delays, concessions, substitutions, &amp;c. There is thus a margin of 80,000 tons over the figure of 250,000 tons which was indicated in our instructions. If it is decided that the tonnage available permits the adoption of the lower scheme, we strongly recommend that this margin should be used, not for admitting some of the articles which we propose to exclude, but for accumulating additional stocks of the most necessary articles, such as grain and iron-ore, with a view to future contingencies.Annex I. Summary of Recommendations. Section I. Existing Prohibitions. (A.) Paper and Paper-making Materials.Imports as a whole to be reduced to 50,000 tons a month. Estimated saving 57,000 tons a month and 8,000,000Z. a year.Printed posters and other printed or coated papers, as well as paper-hangings, to be altogether excluded. Importation of foreign printed matter, including books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, &amp;c, except for single copies through the post, should cease, subject to the granting of licences in exceptional cases. Other measures : 1. The size of posters to be restricted.2. The use of paper for contents bills, catalogues, or other advertising purposes to be restricted.3. Priority for Government requirements and the needs of certain important export trades.4. Steps to be taken for enforcing economy in consumption by GovernmentDepartments and others. 5. Further efforts to be made for collecting waste paper.(B.) Other Prohibitions.Licensing to be restricted so far as possible. A further saving will result from the fact that the restrictions were not in force or fully operative throughout the whole of 1916. Total estimated saving 30,000 tons a month and 8,000,000Z. a year.Section II. Timber. The following measures are recommended :  1. Steps to secure economy in use by  (a.) Cabinet instruction ; &apos;(b.) Restriction on use of timber for civilian purposes; (c.) Salvage, especially in France.2. That steps be taken to increase the supply of home-grown timber, both in the United Kingdom and in France.For the above purposes it is essential that a single strong authority should be set up in close relation to the military authorities ; meanwhile, importation of timber of all kinds to be placed on the prohibited list and licensed.Estimated saving 200,000 tons a month and 15,000,000/. a year in value.
Section III. Foodstuffs and Feeding-stuffs.- 1. Raw Fruit and Vegetables.The following to be prohibited and 50 per cent, licensed : Apples,Oranges (except bitter oranges),Grapes,Bananas,Almonds and nuts,Onions,Tomatoes.The following to be prohibited absolutely : Other raw fruit (but not vegetables).The following to be prohibited absolutely if imports as a whole are reduced by 500,000 tons a month :-Apples,Bananas,Tomatoes.[Note. The produce of the Channel Islands is to be regarded in every case as exempted from prohibitions.]Estimated saving 38,000 tons a month and 8,500,0001. a year, or with maximum restriction 52,000 tons a month and 12,000,0001. a year.2. Food &quot; Luxuries.&quot;Import of the following articles to be prohibited and importation to be regulated as shown below : Aerated, mineral, and table waters :   Exclude absolutely except for medicinal purposes.Canned salmon and lobster:  License 50 per cent., supplies being drawn fromCanada and the United States in proportion to pre-war imports. Coffee : Exclude absolutely, but allow re-export from stock. Raw cocoa : Exclude foreign absolutely, and license half British-grown cocoa. Preparations of cocoa : Exclude absolutely.Articles of food containing sugar (for definition see Report) : Exclude absolutely. Tea: Exclude foreign absolutely, and restrict Indian and Ceylon tea as shown in Report.Wine : License 50 per cent, of 1913 imports. Brandy : License 50 per cent, of 1913 imports. Rum : Exclude absolutely.Estimated saving 25,500 tons a month and 24,000,000Z. a year. Tobacco : Arrangement with the British American Tobacco Company to be recon-sidered.Fruits canned, bottled, and preserved : Already prohibited.   Exclude-absolutely if maximum reduction is enforced, otherwise license 50 per cent.3. Cereals and Foodstuffs..(a.) Brewing.New restriction will secure additional net saving of 24,000 tons a month; if maximum restriction is to be enforced this is insufficient, and we recommend further restriction, which will yield a total saving of at least 48,000 tons a month.Estimated saving on exchange 3,500,000L or 7,000,0001 a year, as the case may be.Further recommendations : (i.) Sugar used for brewing to &quot;be excluded absolutely, (li.) Restrictions to be placed on carriage of beer barrels over railways.(b.)

The saving estimated to result from these causes is 10,000 tons a month.Annex II.-Articles not to be Excluded.The following articles have been considered by us, and we recommend that their importation should.not at present be restricted, or that any restriction to which they may be subject should not at present be increased for reasons of tonnage : Food and DrinU Grain and flour of all kinds.Meat.&apos;Butter.Cheese.Eggs.Fish, other than canned salmon and lobsters.Oranges, bitter.Lemons.Haw vegetables, other than onions and tomatoes.

RESTRICTION  OP  IMPORTS.Detailed Report.[Notc-The figures contained in the Official Trade Returns of the United Kingdom, winch have been issued since the outbreak of war, include all imports of foodstuffs on Government account; but they do not include similar imports of other commodities -which were on importation declared as imported on Government account.&apos;]SECTION I. EXISTING PROHIBITIONS.(A.)-Paper and Paper-making Materials.13. PAPER and paper-making materials are already on the Prohibited Import List, the prohibition being administered by the Royal Commission on Paper. During the last ten months of 1910 imports of these articles were reduced by one-third of the imports during 1914.The imports in the last three years were as follows : Tons.1914   .. .. .. .. ..&apos; ,. .. ..   1,798,0001915   ..     -..............   1,693,0001916   .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,281,00014. In Appendix III to this Report there is printed a letter addressed to the President of the Board of Trade by the Chairman of the Commission, in which it is suggested that it would be possible during 1917 to make a further reduction over the 1916 imports of 50 per cent, in respect of packing and wrapping paper, strawboard, millboard, and wood-pulp boxes, boxes and cartons of paper and cardboard ; and of 33^ per cent, in respect of other descriptions of paper and paper-making materials.The Commission estimate that the imports of paper and paper-making materials during the year beginning the 1st March, 1917, wrould on this basis not exceed 720,000 tons : this being equivalent to 40 per cent, of the imports in the calendar year 1914.In other words, the average monthly import when the prohibition is fully effective will amount to 60,000 tons, as compared with an average monthly import during 1916 of 107,000 tons a saving of 47,000 tons a month.The Commission represent that the carrying out of the above proposals would involve a considerable amount of hardship, especially for proprietors of newspapers, periodicals, and magazines, Avho have during 1916 drawn largely on their stocks. We gather that these users are responsible for about one-half of the total consumption of paper in the country.15. We consider, however, that it is necessary to go beyond the measure proposed by the Cummission, and that imports of paper and paper-making materials as a whole should be reduced to about one-third of the imports during 1914, that is, to an average amount of 50,000 tons per month, giving a further saving of 10,000 tons per month or 57,000 tons per month in all. The saving in exchange would be about 8,00(),000L a year. As further restriction on packing and wrapping paper and paper board may be impracticable in view of their increasing use for munition and other essential purposes, the additional saving will have to be effected mainly at the expense of printing and writing paper and paper-making materials. This result should be obtained by abandoning the preferential treatment, as regards further reductions, proposed for these latter categories by the Roj al Commission.The above proposals will render necessary large economies in the use of paper for newspapers, periodicals, advertising, &amp;c. We represent strongly that such economies will have a valuable effect not only in the saving of tonnage, but also as a clear indication to other interests which will suffer from the reductions proposed and to our Allies that the strictest economy is being exercised. In this connection we attach great importance to the restrictions on the use of paper which we recommend below. [244-5] D
We have included the whole of the reduction which we recommend in the smaller programme as well as in the larger, not only for these reasons, but also because we understand that it is important both to the Royal Commission and to the trade not to be left in any doubt as to the extent of the restriction which will be imposed.16. Some of our members are in favour of a still larger reduction in this import; and if the situation should require a restriction of even more than 500,000 tons per month we all agree that a further reduction would have to be made.] 7. In order to safeguard interests in the United Kingdom against competition from foreign printers, which in the new circumstances would be manifestly unfair, we recom-meud the total prohibition of the importation of printed posters, and other printed or coated papers, as well as paper-hangings. The importation of foreign printed matter, including books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, &amp;c, except for single copies sent through the post, should cease, subject to the granting of licences in exceptional cases. The additional saving likely to result from this proposal is inconsiderable, and would amount to only about 100 tons a month.18. We consider that the adoption of the measures outlined below would make for economy in the consumption, of paper, and thus to some extent mitigate the incidence of a further restriction. We accordingly recommend their adoption, in so far as may be possible, but we must leave their consideration in detail to the departments concerned.1. The posting after a specified date on hoardings and elsewhere of posters of more than a certain size (say a single sheet of defined size) should be prohibited, as well as the combination or multiplication of posters of the authorised size on one and the same hoarding.2. The use of contents bills and of paper for catalogues or other advertising purposes should be prohibited or restricted so far as practicable.3. It would be desirable, if possible, to institute a priority system, which would secure the supply of paper for Government requirements and the needs of certain important export trades.4. Further steps should be taken to enforce economy in the consumption of paper, both by Government Departments and by others.5. Increased efforts should be made to organise the collection of waste paper, though labour difficulties are involved. The pressure of reduced supplies of raw material will no doubt operate automatically in this direction, as well as in increasing the use of materials produced in this country.(B.) Other Articles already ox the Prohibited Import List.19. Besides paper and paper-making materials, a considerable number of articles, of which a list is appended to this Report (Appendix IV), are already actually on the Prohibited List, or are held to be covered by existing prohibitions. The administration of most of these prohibitions is in the hands of tlie Import Restrictions Department of the Board of Trade.The various prohibitions are referred to in different parts of this Report, but any additional saving recommended in respect of them has not been taken into account in estimating the reduction in imports possible in each section as a result of new prohibitions.It is estimated that existing prohibitions will yield a saving of about 30,000 tons a month during 1917, as compared with 1916, partly because the prohibitions were either not in force or not fully operative throughout the whole of last year, and partly because it may in some cases be possible to increase their stringency. The saving in exchange may be estimated roughly at about 8,000,00.0/. per annum.SECTION LI. TIMBER.20.^ We ^ consider that questions affecting timber are of vital importance in connection with any proposals having in view a large reduction of imports.The imports of timber amount to more than 6,000,000 tons per annum. There is plenty of timber in the woods of the United Kingdom and France to supply all needs, military and civil, for several years, if it can be extracted. If one-half only of the imported timber were replaced by home:growm timber, the relief of tonnage would amount to 250,000 tons per month.
There is no other import of large volume which can be reduced and replaced by a home product without delay, without privation, with benefit to exchange, without serious injury of any kind, and with so little expenditure of labour.The extraction of the timber is a question of (a) labour ; (6) transport; (c) organi-sation; and in order that the questions of labour and transport may be solved, it is essential that a suitable organisation should be created for dealing with the whole question. We indicate below the nature of the organisation which we suggest. We consider its creation a matter of extreme urgency.The imports of soft timber into the United Kingdom in 1916 (Board of Trade Returns) were: Soft Woods.	Amount.	Value.	Tads.&quot;	 Hewn wood	213,000	2,251,000Pit-wood           ..         ..      - ..	: 2,021,000	i   6,908,000Sawn wood	3,686,000	27,748,000Sleepers and staves	309,000	2,122,000Total	6,229,000	39,029,000* Elsewhere in this report quantities are given in tons. We have therefore thought it convenient in dealing&apos; with timber to convert loads and standards into their approximate equivalents in tons the load being- treated as equivalent to 1 ton and the standard to 3 tons.21. The imports of furniture and hard woods are already controlled, and amounted in 1916 to 89,000 tons only.We deal separately with the questions of (A.) Soft timber generally. (B.)- Pit-wood.(A.)-Soft Timber Generally.22. The requirements of soft timber for 1917 are at present estimated as follows : Tons.   .War Office      .. .. ......     .. .. .. 2,250,000fMinistry of Munitions    .. .. .. .. ... &apos;       ..    750,000Admiralty       ... .. .. .. .. .. ..     75,000Other Government Departments   .. .. .. .. 150,000Indirect war and essential civil requirements .. .. .. 1,200,0004,425,000Omitting pit-props, the imports for the year 1916 (as given in the Boardof Trade Returns) were          ..         ..         ..         ..         .. 4,203,000To this figure should be added Imports direct to France for war purposes        ..         ..         .. 375,000Imports into this counlrv for direct Government account  (notincluded in Board of Trade Returns) ..         ..         ..         .. 240,000Total     .. .. .. .. 4,823,000t Since this estimate was furnished we are informed that increased demands have been received from the Conirnander-in-(Jhief in France, which, if continued throughout the year, will involve &apos;an addition of about 600,000 tons to this figure.23. Apart from the imports, the Home-grown Timber Committee have produced approximately 150,000 tons during the year for war purposes. It follows that the import, together with the home-grown supply, was about 550,000 tons in excess of the estimated requirements for 1917.24. From a census which lias just been taken it appears that the stock of timber in the hands of merchants is at present approximately 1,800,000 tons, and, on a very rough estimate, the amount in the hands of firms consuming timber is put at 1,200,000 tons.From these figures it appears that there are in the country roughly eight months&apos; supplies, but a considerable proportion of this stock would probably be unsuitable for military purposes, and the figures may to some extent be misleading as applied to the needs of -the Army and the Ministry of Munitions.[244-5] E
25. Large stocks are, moreover, needed in the country in the beginning of the year to tide over the closed water season. Owing to the closing by ice of the St. Lawrence, the White Sea, and the Northern Scandinavian ports, the imports of timber during the first six months of the year are only about one-third of the year&apos;s supplies. Consequently the dangerous months, from the point of view of supplies, are about the middle of the year, and if reduction in tonnage is to be effected it ought to be in the latter months of the year. This is particularly important in view of the possibility that very large additional quantities may be needed for the spring offensive. Even on present demands the War Timber Commission are experiencing the greatest difficulty in meeting requirements, and are being forced to draw upon stocks in the countiy.26. The difficulty of arriving at any definite conclusions as to the extent to which the import of timber could be restricted in safety is intensified by the fact that there is no available estimate of the amount of timber required for indirect war work, and for other indispensable purposes. Almost every trade requires timber in some shape or form, and it is necessary that supplies should be available for innumerable purposes having only an indirect connection with war work, but at the same time essential for the production of supplies and for the maintenance of the export trade.(B.)-Pit Timber.27. The consumption before the war was about 4.500,000 tons per annum, of which it is estimated that one-fifth was supplied from the United Kingdom. It has now fallen, partly in consequence of the reduced output of coal, to 3,500,000 tons in 1916 of which over 2 million tons were imported, mainly from France and Scandinavia.The Board of Agriculture, as the result of special enquiries, estimate that the woods of the United Kingdom contain pit-wood sufficient for one and a half years&apos; complete supply on the pre-war scale, without trenching seriously upon the capital of the woods.. If these supplies can be made available in increased quantities a very large reduction can be effected in the quantity imported.(i.) Measures Recommended.28. The means for bringing about large reductions in the imports of timber appear to be: 1. Measures for securing economy in its use, both for war and civil purposes. 2. Measures for increasing the supply of home-grown timber, both in the United Kingdom and in France.(a.) Measures for Securing Economy in Use. 29 Our recommendations under this head are as follows :  1. We suggest that a Cabinet instruction, on the lines of the annexed draft (see Annex at the end of this Section), be issued to the War Department, the Ministry of Munitions, and other Departments, enjoining the very strictest economy in the use of all timber, and the employment of home-grown timber, where possible, in place of imported timber.2. We recommend also that measures be taken to restrict the use of timber for civil purposes building, packing of goods, &amp;c. We do not make detailed recommendations as to the means by which this could be done, since for that purpose consultation with the trade would be required. If our recommendations as to a special authority to deal with timber are accepted, it would be the duty of that authority to consider and execute the necessary measures.3. One important element in economy is the salvage, return, and re-use of packing-cases of all kinds, cartridge boxes, shell cases, &amp;c., which have been sent to France. The difficulties are doubtless great, but the importance of overcoming them is obvious when it is pointed out that every ton of wood returned from France saves the import of a ton from Scandinavia or Russia, and, in addition, economises the labour required for the manufacture of the boxes, cases, &amp;c.(b.) Measures for Increasing the Supply of Home-grown Timber.30. We believe that the supply of timber from the United Kingdom and from France can be largely increased.
31. Present Position.-We have no information as to the amount of timber supplied from French forests, or as to the amount of timber supplied for civil purposes from the woods of the United Kingdom.Timber to the amount of 150,000 tons was supplied from the United Kingdom for military purposes by the Home-grown Timber Committee during 1916.That Committee is now supplying 24,000 tons per month of sawn timber from England and Scotland, the number of men employed for this purpose being about 3,500 (British, 1,000 ; Canadian, 1,900 ; prisoners of war, 600). The amount of labour is being increased, and the Committee expects to produce 450,000 tons in 1917.32. In considering how the British supply of timber of all kinds can be increased, the first question is that of labour. The supply from existing sources should be increased in every way possible. We understand that there is difficulty in obtaining large numbers of lumbermen from Canada. Some attempts have been made to draw from other countries, such as Portugal. These-should be continued, and other countries might be tried for instance, Newfoundland, Australia, and New Zealand.In addition, we suggest that soldiers of the Home Defence army should be employed in wood cutting. Their employment in dock work is, we understand, very successful, and does not interfere with their military value. For much of the work, especially for pit-wood, skilled labour is not necessary.33. The second question is transport. The railways are congested, and coasting-vessels are hardly obtainable for sea transport. The question is also complicated by the fact that the pit-props can most conveniently be conveyed to the pits in empty waggons which have conveyed coal from the pits, and that these may not be available at the sources of wood supply. We have ascertained, however, that the railways could undertake to convey an additional 10,000 tons a week of pit-props, and perhaps more, to the mines.If the necessary labour is found for cutting this amount of pit timber and placing it on the rail the imports can immediately be reduced by 520,000 tons per annum.The chief obstacle to the increase of the supply by private enterprise of home-grown pit timber (apart from scarcity of labour-) is the high cost of transport by rail. Special rates have already been conceded; but we recommend that the question C;f further reductions, and of an extension of flat rates, be considered by the Board of Trade and the railway authorities, with the special object of bringing forward home supplies.. 34. The third question is sawing machinery. The difficulty of obtaining machinery may cause delay in increasing the supply of sawn timber ; but it need not influence the increase of pit timber.35. We understand that the Home-grown Timber Committee have not experienced difficulty in finding woods suitable for their operations; but if any difficulty should be found, we recommend that compulsory rjowers be exercised. We also recommend that full publicity be given to the necessity, in the public interest, of an increased home supply.Similar considerations apply to the development of the supply of timber in France. We are informed that steps are being taken to increa.se largely the number of Canadians employed there, and we recommend strongly that this policj^ should be pursued with the greatest possible energy.There are large areas of forest close behind the front of the ,armies in France; but hitherto the French Forest Department has not allowed cutting to take place in these forests except in accordance with their regular scheme. If a clear cut were permitted the work would be much more rapid and the supplies of timber from the forests which are conveniently situated much larger. We recommend that the French Government should be urged to allow unrestricted cutting in the forests nearest the front, even though this may sacrifice their future for a certain number of years. Increased supplies of timber from this source are the most useful of all, since they will not only release tonnage, but will relieve the congestion of the French ports and railways.36. Although it is not possible with safety to make any large reductions in the imports of timber during the spring months, we consider that it is desirable to bring the imports under control with a view to reductions in future. For this purpose we recommend that the imports of all kinds of timber should be-prohibited, but that for the present they should be freely licensed. It is undesirable to set up a licensing system if it can be avoided, but we believe that it will be indispensable in the near future, and that any disadvantage caused by setting it up before it is absolutely required will be more than compensated by the advantage of having the machinery in operation when restriction begins.
(ii.) Authority to Control Timber,37. At present the following authorities deal with the timber question in its various aspects : 1. The Commander-in-Chief in France controls the military uses of timber in France, the arrangements for obtaining and transporting timber from certain of the French forests, and the salvage and despatch homewards of used boxes, cases, &amp;c.2. The War Timber Commission, representing the Office of Works, the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and the French and Belgian military authorities, is responsible for the supply of imported timber to France and its allotment to the forces of the respective countries.3. The Office of Works is responsible for the purchase of timber to meet the demands of the War Timber Commission.4. The Transport Department of the Admiralty is responsible for finding tonnage to convey timber purchased abroad for military, purposes to the United Kingdom or to France, and also to convev timber from the United Kingdom to France.5. The Home-grown Timber Committee (appointed by the Board of Agriculture) is responsible for increasing the supply of home-grown timber for military purposes. Its operations are at present mainly in the United Kingdom, but a large extension of its operations in France is also being arranged for.6. The supply of pit-props for coal mines has been dealt with by the Board of Trade and the Board of Agriculture, and also in part by the Coal Mines Committee under the Home Office. It would naturally fall within the province of the Coal Controller if it is decided to appoint one.38. At present no authority has been charged with exercising any check either upon the importation or tbe consumption of timber.39. It appears to us that, in order to carry out a vigorous policy of developing home supplies and economising consumption, it is essential that the greater part of the functions described above should be concentrated in a single authority. The work of this authority would fall into three main branches : 1. The purchase and supply of timber for military requirements, including those of the Ministry of Munitions, and for other Government Departments.2. The control and licensing of imports and the utilisation of existing stocks, and the restrictions to be imposed on the use ol timber in the United Kingdom.3. The development of home supplies for military purposes, for pit timber, for sleepers, and for general civil use.40. It should also keep in view the question of reconstituting forests and safe-guarding the future interests of forestry in this country.41. The authority should be constituted in such a manner as to enable it to take strong and rapid action; and in order that it may operate without friction, it should be in close relation to the military authorities.Whether it is desirable to create an independent authority, with a Controller of Ministerial rank, or to attach the authority for its relation with the Cabinet and Parliament to one of the existing Departments, is a question beyond our competence. In any case, it is essential that the authority should have great independence of action.(hi.) Results. &amp;42. We estimate as follows the reductions which can be effected in the various ways recommended: Tons.Excess of 1916 imports and home production over requirements of 1917.. 550,000 Increase in supplies from French forests for military purposes.. ..      250,000Increase of production in United Kingdom for military purposes .. 300,000 Increase in production in United Kingdom of pit-props .. ..      300,000Supplies drawn from stocks in United Kingdom (one-quarter of stock) ..      750,000 Economies in use, military and civil (say, 5 per cent, of estimated require-ments)      .. .. .. .. ....      220,000Total .. .. ..   2,370,000(Say, 200,000 tons per month.)
These figures are necessarily conjectural; but we are convinced that if the policy which we have indicated is pursued with energy and determination they can be realised, and probably exceeded.If special steps in the direction we have indicated are not taken, the saving would probably not exceed 100,000 tons per month.Annex to Section II.Draft Cabinet Instruction on Economy in Use of Timber.The necessity for largely diminishing the import of timber into this country has become urgent. Steps must be taken at once to restrict the use of timber as far as may be compatible with the efficiency of the public service. There is reason to believe that greater economy can be exercised in future both in the number of new buildings and in their method of construction as well as. in the use of timber in works of every kind. Rigid economy should be enforced in connection with the making of all manufactured articles involving the use of timber, such as packing cases and the general work of internal furnishing of hutments, factories, and workshops.The attention of the chiefs of all Government Departments who are concerned with the use of timber is drawn to these points, and they are requested to see that the following instructions are carried out: -1. No new building work involving the use of timber should be undertaken unless its urgency is strictly proved.2. Concrete, brick, or other suitable materials should be used as. far as possible in substitution for wood.3. Temporary buildings should not be erected unless no existing buildings can be found suitable for the purpose in view.4. Home-produced materials, such as fibre board, baskets, bags and the like, should be used whenever possible instead of wood and tin-plate in the manufacture of packing boxes, cases and crates for munitions and stores.Where the use of wood is unavoidable, it must be employed in the most economical way possible as regards both quantity and quality. The method of making the boxes, &amp;c, should be such as to-ensure the least amount of damage in opening, and to enable them to be taken to pieces and packed flat for return so that they may be used several times.5. Where the use of wood is essential, every effort must be made to utilise home-grown supplies instead of imported timber.0. Heads of Departments should report within one month the steps taken to give effect to the foregoing instructions, and should furnish an&apos;estimate of the saving which they consider will be made.With the same aim of economy in view, the Commander-in-Chief in France should be requested to give the necessary instructions for ensuring the adoption of the most economical &quot; method of employing timber in trenches at the front and in ad work connected with the armies in the field, and for. the return, whenever possible, of all wooden cases and ammunition boxes.SECTION III. FOODSTUFFS AND FEEDING-STUFFS.43. We have examined the question how far it is possible to economise tonnage bv curtailing the import of foodstuffs and feeding-stuffs, and we submit recommendations which, if carried into effect, would produce a considerable saving. In framing these proposals we have had the benefit of expert advice from the Departments of State concerned, and also from the Royal Commissions on the sugar and wheat supplies. The present proposals would imply some important changes Jn the habits of con-sumption, especially as regards beer, fresh fruit, and canned provisions; but we believe that they could be carried out without injury to the health and efficiency of the nation. It would be necessary to take measures for ensuring more even distribution of some articles, and in some cases control of price would be essential; but it would not be necessary to institute a general system of control of consumption. If it is found that a much larger reduction of imports is inevitable, we believe the imports of foodstuffs and of feeding-stuffs could be further cut down without allowing the supplies to fall below the minimum required for health and efficiency ; but this could hardly be done without instituting a general system of control in respect of. some of the most important foods [244-5]   &apos; F
The recommendations in this Section are divided under four main heads, according to the articles with which they deal: 1. Raw fruit and vegetables and dried fruit;2. Articles of a less essential nature, generally dutiable, which partake more of thenature of &quot;luxuries,&quot; and may be so described for want of a better term;3. Cereals, meat, and feeding-stuffs.; 4. Sugar.(i.) Raw Fktjit and Vegetables.44. We are of opinion that it would not be practicable to effect a large reduction in imports as a whole unless severe restrictions are imposed on imports of raw fruit and vegetables, over a million tons of which are imported annually.Imported fruit is of course available at the season when there is no home-grown fruit, and large quantities, especially of bananas and oranges, are consumed by the working classes. Fruit possesses a dietetic value; but its actual nutritive value is small compared with its bulk.Similarly, vegetables, other than potatoes, on which we propose no restriction, have only a low nutritive value. Onions are, however, largely used for seasoning, and at a time when variety of diet will necessarily be restricted, their total exclusion might entail real hardship on the people, especially the poorer classes. In the case of tomatoes there is less objection to exclusion. Other vegetables classed as &quot; Unenumerated &quot; in the Monthly Trade Accounts (value 233,000Z. in 1916) do not bulk large, and comprise mostly fresh vegetables brought into the country without any considerable waste of cargo space. Unless for reasons of policy it is thought desirable to exclude articles of luxury, such, for instance, as asparagus, we should not recommend any restriction on the last-named class of vegetables.45. It will be apparent that raw fruit and vegetables (except potatoes) cannot be regarded as staples in the &amp;.ame degree as wheat, meat, or even sugar, and it would in our opinion be difficult to justify restrictions on essential articles, should circumstances eventually require such action, unless the commodities now under consideration had first been dealt with.46. We understand that hitherto action such as that now contemplated has been impracticable for three principal reasons : 1. An undertaking has been given to the self-governing Dominions that no prohibition will be imposed on their produce. The undertaking was given in circum-stances different from those now prevailing, and we consider that steps should be taken to secure a release from it. Apples are the oidy fruit seriously affected, being imported largely from Canada. Whilst, we should welcome an arrangement which, wherever possible, admitted colonial but excluded foreign fruit, there would, we understand, be reason in that case to fear retaliation from the United States of America,-retaliation which it would be unwise to risk at the present moment. As regards apples from Australia, a tonnage arrangement has been effected which will automatically secure a reduction in their importation. It should be pointed out that there is a small import of certain other varieties of fruit, notably, pears, grapes, and peaches, from the Dominions.2. There is an understanding with France and Italy that the importation of their produce will either not be prohibited or will be licensed freely. That understanding is of greater importance in connection with manufactured articles. In connection with fruit and vegetables neither France nor Italy is likely to be much affected. France would be affected only by prohibition on vegetables and on certain classes of raw fruit, such as plums, pears, cherries, currants, and the like, which congest the railways and should certainly be excluded. Italy would be affected principally by a prohibition on lemons, nuts, and oranges. We understand that no large quantity of Italian oranges will be available this year for consumption in the United Kingdom, as a large part of the crop has passed into Germany. Such quantity as remains could no doubt be. utilised by the army in France. Lemons possess a quasi-medicinal value, and are imported almost wholly from Italy. In the circumstances we do not recommend any restriction.3. The most serious difficulties are likely to be experienced with Spain, on which country we ,are dependent for important raw materials necessary for the prosecution of the war.   Any restriction on her fruit and -vegetables, not arranged by mutual consent,.
might expose us to retaliation, and we therefore recommend that negotiations should be commenced at once. The utilisation of idle tonnage in Spanish ports would naturally form an important element in such negotiations. The matter is most urgent, since the shipping season for oranges, which ends in May, has already begun.In 1915 the proportions of the principal fruits and vegetables imported into the United Kingdom which were shipped from Spain (and the Canary Islands) were as follows: oranges 95 per cent., grapes 73 per cent., bananas 34 per cent., almonds and nuts 23 per cent., onions 60 per cent., aud tomatoes 62 per cent.It is probable that freight difficulties will in any case effect a very large reduction in the imports of Spanish oranges. As regards onions, it is understood that the War Office, are contemplating considerable purchases, the intention being to supply the forces at Salonica from Egypt and the forces in France from Italy and Spain. In the latter case the produce would be transported by rail direct. It is thus piobable that imports into the United Kingdom will automatically fall to 50 per cent, of last years total. The fact that for domestic reasons Spain has been obliged to prohibit the export of potatoes might be used as a counter in any conversations between the Governments.47. For reasons already stated, we consider it essential that the diplomatic difficulties which have hitherto hampered our actions should be overcome. Subject to this qualification, we recommend that the following articles should be placed on the list of prohibited imports, the prohibition, however, not to extend to the produce of the Channel Islands : Raw fruit, not including lemons, but including almonds and other nuts used asfruit. Onions. Tomatoes.48. The policy as regards licensing imports should conform with the following recom-mendations, the imports for 1916 being taken as the standard on which the proposed reductions should be based. Produce purchased by His Majest)r&apos;s Government in neutral European countries for the purpose, of restricting the supplies of the enemy should of course be admitted under licence; but it is desirable that such purchases should, wherever possible, be included in the total amount of a given article allowed to be imported into the United Kingdom in a given period, so that the total volume of jmports of that article allowed may not be exceeded.49. Apples. To be reduced by 50 per cent., unless it should prove necessary to cut down imports as a whole by 500,000 tons per month, in which case the prohibition should be absolute.As the shipping season from the United- States of America and Canada is the autumn and winter, this restriction will not have much effect before next autumn. It maybe noted that we import normally 43 per cent, of our apples from the United States of America, 38 per cent, from Canada, and 11 per cent, from Australia.50. Oranges. Bitter oranges (Spain) are of special value in the form of marmalade ; their quantity is small, and a general licence should be given for their importation. Other oranges should be reduced by 50 per cent.51. Grapes. To be reduced by 50 per cent. &apos; Grapes are imported mainly from Spain and Portugal. *52. Bananas to be reduced by 50 per cent., unless it should prove necessary to cut down imports as a whole by 500,000 tons per month, in which case the prohibition should be absolute. Only a very small proportion (7 per cent.) comes from British Possessions, 34 per cent, being obtained from the Canary Islands and the balance from Central America. Imports are fairly constant all the year round, but the highest point is reached in July-August and the lowest in December-January.53. All other Descriptions of Raw Fruit should be totally excluded, except in cases where it is desirable that licences should be given for Blockade reasons.54. Almonds and other Nuts used as Fruit-Nuts possess some nutritive value, and we recommend only a 50 per cent, reduction.
55. Onions to be reduced by 50 per cent. Tbe bulk conies from Spain (60 per cent.) and Egypt (30 per cent). The normal import from Holland has decreased considerably, but it is understood that purchases are being made by His Majestys Government for the purpose of restricting the supplies available for enemy consumption. The main shipping season is during the autumn and winter months.56. Tomatoes- Imports other than from the Channel Islands to be reduced by 50 per cent, unless it should prove necessary to cut down imports as a whole by 500,000 tons per month, in which case they should be stopped altogether. The Channel Islands supply normally about one-third and Spain and the Canary Islands more than one-half of the tomatoes imported into the United Kingdom. The largest imports are in the months of July, August, and September.57. It maybe estimated that the above recommendations, if carried into effect, will yield a saving in the ensuing twelve months of 38,000 tons per month, or, should it be necessary to enforce the maximum restriction, of 52,000 tons per month. The saving in value over a twelve months&apos;period would he from 8,500,0001 to 12,000,0001. The subjoined statement indicates the distribution of the saving: -Article.	Imports during 1916,		Estimated Monthly Saving.	Tons.		Tons.Apples	133,000	2,740,000	5.500 (or 11,000 tons).Oranges (except bitter)	294.000	8,090,000	11,200Grapes	40,000	1,097,000	1,600Bananas	152,000	2,210.000	6,300 (or 12,600 tons).Almonds and nuts	36,000	1,620.000	1,500Other fruits (raw)	30.000	893,000	2,500Onions  ..          . .	171,000	2,060,000	7,100Tomatoes	82,000	1,950,000	2,300 (or 4,500 tons).Total    ..	938,000	15,660,000	38,000 (er 52,000 tons).(Note.-Allowance has been made for imports of grapes and tomatoes from the Ohanuel Islands, which have not been included in the estimates of tonnage and value saved. Imports of other articles from the Channel Islands are negligible.)58. Dried Fruits. The existing prohibition on tbe import of dried fruits does not cover dried dates, and currants have been specifically exempted. As dried fruits have a high food value and do not occupy much cargo space, we do not recommend any alteration either in the existing prohibition or in the arrangements by which certain quantities of prohibited fruits are admitted under licence.(ii.) &quot; Luxuries.&quot;59. In view of the tonnage stringency we consider that imports of certain commodities which are in the nature of luxuries, and possess no nutritive advantages commensurate with their bulk or their value, should be drastically curtailed., In the case of tea, coffee, and cocoa, which can hardly be regarded as &quot; luxuries,&quot; our recommendations are mainly based on the large stocks which already exist in the country.        %60. Aerated and Mineral Waters and Table Waters come mostly from France. We recommend that the importation of all such waters, whether dutiable or not, be totally prohibited, unless it can be shown that they are required for clearly medicinal purposes. A saving of about 100 tons a month would thus probably be ensured.61. Canned Salmon and Lobster are imported principally from the United States of America and Canada. There is a small but growing import of canned salmon from Japan. Both articles, although used mainly by the poorer classes, possess a small nutritive value in proportion to their bulk and cost.We recommend that imports of canned salmon and lobster be reduced to 50 per cent, of the imports for 1916, supplies being drawn from Canada and the United States in proportion to the pre-war imports from each of those countries. The gross saving monthly would be about 3,000 tons. The net saving will, however, be less, since other foods will take the place of.those excluded, and may be estimated at half that figure.
62. Coffee,-(Imports in 1916, 82,000 tons.) There are about five years&apos; stocks in the country. Import should be totally prohibited, and a saving of some 7,000 tonsa month thus secured. Re-exports (24,000 tons in 1916) should be allowed from stocks in the United Kingdom for reasons of exchange. 2,000 tons are sent monthly to Holland for Belgian relief.63. Cocoa, Raw.-There is rather more than a year&apos;s stock at present in the country. Imports in 1916 reached 88,000 tons (60,000 tons from British Possessions; 28,000 from other countries), having doubled since 1914, when they were 42^000 tons. ^ We recommend that the import of all foreign-grown cocoa, and 50 per cent, of British-grown cocoa be prohibited ; 5,000 tons a month would thus be saved. We understand that a certain amount of cocoa beans are sent to Holland for the production of cocoa powder and cocoa butter. This arrangement, and also the Swiss ration of cocoa, should be reconsidered.64. Preparations of Cocoa (mainly from Switzerland and Netherlands) should be prohibited absolutely a saving of 1,000 tons a month-provided arrangements can be made for reducing the Swiss rations of cocoa, sugar, and other materials.65. Articles of Food containing Sugar. (Imports in 1916, 11,800 tons.) We recommend the exclusion of articles, described in the Monthly Trade Accounts, as &quot; confectionery (except chocolate confectionery)&quot; and &quot; other articles of food containing sugar.&quot;*   The saving will be about 1,000 tons per month.66. Tea. The figures for 1916 are 	Imports.	Re-exports.	Stock.Indian and Ceylon tea Other tea (China and Java mainly) ,.	Tons. 143,774 24,695	Tons. 21,038 6,751	Tons. j&quot;56,000-5S,000Total       ..	168,469	27,789	56,000-58,000We do not suggest that consumption in this country should be reduced, having regard especially to the restrictions on brewing; but a reduction of imports can be secured by drawing upon stocks, which amount to four and a-half months&apos; consumption, and by restricting re-exports.We recommend (a.) The total prohibition of the import of foreign tea a reduction of 2,000 tons a month ;(6.) A reduction of the&apos;import of Indian and Ceylon tea from 143,750 to 120,000 tons (about 17 per cent.) giving a further saving of 2,000 a month ; and(c) Prohibition of re-exports and licences only in cases where economy of tonnage is secured (say, 8,000 tons).The result of these recommendations would be a total saving of 4,000 tons a month.The restriction can, we think, be most conveniently enforced by regulation of exports in India and Ceylon. The tonnage allowed should be allotted in the proportion of 70 per cent, to India and 30 per cent, tu Ceylon. The amounts purchased &quot;by the War Office in India and Ceylon (estimated to amount to 22,000 tons this year) should be reckoned as forming part of the 120,000 tons allowed.Some hardship will be caused to growers, since tea cannot be stored in India; but in any case they would probably be unable to secure tonnage for the whole of the crop.67. It will be necessary to control the prices of tea, cocoa, and coffee, in order to prevent speculation and large rises in price.* In 1916 3,700 tons, or 124,000Z. in value, comprised caramel, solid and liquid, chutney, preserved ginger, &amp;c. &quot; . V&apos; J,v[244-5] G
68. Wine.-(Imports in 1916, 45,900 tons). The stocks in bond in this country amount to about eight months&apos; consumption. There are also, no doubt, considerable stocks out of bond, in private cellars and elsewhere. We recommend that importation be reduced by 50 per cent.&apos; as a whole of the imports for 1913. A saving would thus be effected of about 2,000 tons monthly. The largest imports are from France and Portugal, and there may be complaints from the growers; but purchases need not be reduced to the same extent as imports, as the wine can be stored in the country where it is produced. The reduction of 50 per cent, can also be supported by the consideration that brewing in the United Kingdom has now been reduced to 50 per cent, of the pre-war supply.69. Spirits. The stock of brandy represents more than two years&apos; consumption. We recommend that its importation be reduced to 5 0 per cent, of the import for 1913. As regards rum, it is estimated that the army consumes about 1,000,000 gallons per annum, or about one-tenth of the total import in 1916. We recommend that, in view of the large stocks now in the country (representing about four years&apos; consumption), the importa-tion of rum be prohibited absolutely, all purchases for the Army and Navy to be made from stock. The saving effected per month would approximately be 500 tons in the case of brandy, and 3,400 tons in the case of rum.70. Altogether the above recommendations would yield a saving of some 25,500 tons in weight per month, and about 24,000,0001 in value per annum. They are summarised below &apos;:-Imports iu 1916.Aerated, mineral, and table waters .. Canned salmon and lobsters Coffee ..

The above estimate does not include articles already on the prohibited import list, imports of which during 1916 were as follows : 	Amount.	Value.Fruit, canned, bottled, and preserved Tobacco.. Hops   .. Total..	i Tons.                     45,400             1,820,000 75,700              7,390.000 -     7.400                710,000 1		128,500              9,920,000	The tightening of the prohibitions will probably result in some further saving.72. As regards tobacco we understand that there is an arrangement with the British American Tobacco Company whereby they are allowed 20,000 tons of imports, so long as imports by other persons do not exceed 24,000 tons. In consideration of this arrangement, the Company bring to this country, in neutral ships controlled by them, which previously did not trade with Allied countries, some 60,000 tons of general cargo. We recommend for the consideration of the Shipping Controller that this arrangement should be terminated unless the Company&apos;s allowance of tobacco imports can be reduced to 10.000 tons, the imports by other persons being correspondingly reduced. &apos;
73. Imports of canned, bottled, and preserved fruits should be reduced by one-half of the 1916 imports, if imports as a whole are to be reduced by  50,000 tons per month, and stopped altogether if a reduction of 500,000 tons per month is necessary.(iii.) Cereals and Feeding-Stufes.74. Anv proposal actually to reduce the amount of these essential supplies available for human and animal consumption stands of course on a different footing from the recommendations already discussed. As already stated, such a proposal would almost certainly involve a systematic control of consumption,&apos; and though we would by no means exclude the possibility of making such a proposal later, we are not in a position to do so at the moment.While, for instance, the measures already taken in regard to the milling of wheat and the composition of bread will allow a saving of the first instance of 5 per cent, of the wheat imported (23,000 tons a month), with probably another 5 per cent, later, we have not taken this saving into&apos; account in our present recommendations, pending further enquiry, as to the extent to which this saving must be offset by increased importation of feeding-stuffs to make good the loss of wheat offals.Any increase in the home production of cereals and other foods will, of course, render possible a corresponding diminution of imports. It is impossible, however, to estimate what may be the effect of the measures taken with this object, and we do not allow for any reduction on this account.75. Apart from actual reduction of supplies or substitution of home products, it appears that saving could certainly or possibly be effected in the quantities of imported cereals or feeding-stuffs by measures having for their object the curtailment of certain relatively wasteful uses, as follows : -(a.) By restricting the brewing industry ;(6.) By modifying to some extent the existing policy in regard to the slaughter of home-grown cattle ;(c.) By the substitution of feeding-stuffs having a high food value in relation totheir bulk for those with a low value ; (d.) By obtaining alcohol and acetone for explosives otherwise than from thedistillation of certain foodstuffs.(A.) Brewing Mate7*ials.76. We estimate that if the use of brewing materials were entirely stopped it would be possible to realise, as a saving of tonnage, substantially the whole of the volume of brewers&apos; materials which would otherwise be used. This saving, on the basis of the Output of Beer Restriction Act, which was designed to secure a reduction in the amount of beer brewed to 26,000,000 standard barrels in the year ending the 31st March, 1917, would amount to 985,000 tons a year, or 82,000 tons a month.*Any reduction of the volume of brewing less than total prohibition would bring about a proportionate saving of imports, i.e., a reduction of brewing by 30 per cent, on the figure permitted under the Output of Beer Restriction Act (the reduction now announced by the Government) will produce a monthly saving of about 24,000 tons. If imports have to be reduced by as much as 500,000 tons per month, it will be necessary to stop brewing altogether, or if that be decided to be impracticable, to reduce it to a lower figure than that now authorised; It is probable that a great part of the malting necessary for the production of beer has already been completed for the coming season. Accordingly, if further restriction is decided upon, immediate steps would have to be taken to stop malting altogether. Even so, the full effect of such action could not be felt until the autumn.77. We understand from the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply that sugar used for brewing purposes is of low-grade quality, and that there are large stocks at present in the country which are finding their way into trades into which they ought not properly to enter. We therefore recommend a total exclusion of the import of sugar of the description in question until the stocks are nearly consumed.78. A great waste of transport power is caused by the carriage of beer on the railways. Barrels are bulky, and different brewers will not use each others barrels, so that each barrel which is sent out from the brewery full makes a return journey as an empty.   Beer is often sent to distant places; instances have been cited of the supply of* The mode of arriving at this figure is shown fully in Appendix I to this Report.
beer from Scotland to places in the south-west of England. This contributes&quot; to the congestion on the railways, and so reacts upon imports, since our ability to import depends largely on the number of voyages ships are able to complete during the year, and therefore on the efficiency of the ports and of the railwaj^s behind them. More-over, if the railways were free from congestion, the use of home materials in place of imported materials (such as timber) would be facilitated, with double benefit from the point of view of tonnage and of exchange. We therefore recommend that the transport of barrels of beer over long distances should be severely restricted, either by prohibition or by heavy freight charges. This would be in accordance with the policy of the War Office, who have taken steps to secure that troops shall, as far as possible, be supplied from breweries in the vicinity.(B.)-The Meal Supply.79. The increased slaughter of cattle, sheep, and pigs in the United Kingdom would afford a saving in two directions :  1. It would temporarily, at any rate, enable us to import less meat from abroad ; and2. It would afford an even greater relief in regard to the importation of feeding-stuffs.The numbers of cattle in the United Kingdom in 1916 showed an appreciable increase (amounting to 267,000, or over 2 per cent, of the total number for 1914). It is clear that the possibility of reversing this process of increase, and gradually encroaching upon our capital of cattle, must be contemplated as a measure available for dealing with real stringencj^ in regard to food supplies.80. It has further been suggested to us that direct economies in the production of meat could be effected, both by killing at an earlier age and by shortening the average period of fattening,81. All these proposals raise problems of agricultural policy with which we are not competent to deal, and w^e make no recommendation at the moment.82. Poultry and Game. Imports are small, and probably fill space which would otherwise not be filled. We do not recommend any prohibition unless it is considered desirable for reasons of exchange.(C.) Wasteful Importation of Feeding-stuffs.83. The imports for 1916 included 189,000 tons of offals of corn and grain, including rice meal. It appears to us that it should be possible to replace these imports by imports of other feeding-stuffs possessing a higher nutritive value in proportion to their bulk. If this were done it might prove possible to effect a considerable saving of tonnage without affecting in any way the actual supply of feeding-stuffs in this countiy. The matter should be considered further by the Food Controller and the Board of Agriculture.84. Our attention has been called to the importation of soya beans (65,000 tons, value 960,0()0L in 1916) largely for the manufacture of feeding-stuffs, this product yielding a somewhat smaller proportion of oil than other oleaginous seeds and kernels. Soya beans are imported from the Far East, and their properties do not appear to be more valuable than those of analogous products. Whilst we recognise that it is impossible to place any restriction on the amount of oil seeds imported as a whole, we consider that, for the purpose of economising tonnage, they should be brought from sources nearer at hand than the Far East (especially from West Africa), and we accordingly recommend that the importation of soya beans be prohibited.85. It is difficult to estimate what the net saving under this head is likely to be,, but it may amount in all to, say, 5,000 tons a month.(D.)-Distilling Materials.86. Alcohol and acetone are largely used in the manufacture of explosives. The distilleries now employed in producing alcohol and acetone for this purpose consume about 50,000 tons per month of grain and molasses.Many of the distilleries produce yeast as well as alcohol. The yeast is necessary for bread-making, and no alternative method-of producing it has&apos; -yet been devised.
The alcohol distilleries which produce yeast must therefore continue, but the alcohol distilleries which do not produce yeast might be shut down if the alcohol which they produce, amounting to 1,319,000 proof gallons per month, could be provided otherwise.87.&apos; It is suggested that this alcohol might be provided from the very large stocks of proof spirit in bond in this country, employing, of course, the youngest spirit for the purpose. The objection to this course is the cost. The additional expense resulting from this method of supply would depend upon the price at which the spirit in bond was taken over by the Government. It might amount to as much as 8,000,0001. per annum. The saving in material would be 2,000 tons of grain and 10,000 tons of molasses per month.: 88. It has also been suggested that, if the import of rum is prohibited, the West Indian distilleries might be used for producing alcohol instead of rum.   We do not know if they can be easily adapted for this purpose, but it appears to us that if, on further examination, this measure is found to be practicable, it should be adopted as art of the larger programme.(iv.) The Sugar Supply. 89. The Food Controller has stated that a supply on the basis of f lb. of sugar per week per head of the population would be sufficient for all reasonable needs, if it were possible to ensure an even distribution. This would permit of some reduction in the amount at present going into consumption, but we do not allow for any saving of tonnage, since it is probably desirable to increase stocks.(v.) Summary.90. From the recommendations in this Section it may be estimated that there would result a saving of about 92,500 tons; or if it was decided to reduce imports as a whole by 500,000 tons, of 130,500 tons a month, made up as follows : 	For Minimum	For Maximum*	Reduction.

Tons.Raw fruit and vegetables .,	38,000	52,000li Luxury &quot; foods	25,500	25,500Brewing materials	24,000	48,000Wasteful feeding-stuffs (say)	5,000	5,000Total..         ..         ...         ...	92,500	130,500 bOn the exchange side there would be an annual saving of from 8,500,0001. to 12,000,000L in respect of raw. fruit and vegetables, of 24,000,000L in respect of &quot; luxury&quot; goods, and of from 3,500,000/. to 7,000,0001. in respect of brewing materials. In other words, the saving would amount to about 36,000,0001. for the minimum and about 43,000,0001. for the maximum reduction in imports. No allowance is made for any financial saving in regard to feeding-stuffs. *SECTION IV. RAW MATERIALS AND CERTAIN OTHER ARTICLES.(i.) Cotton.91. The import of raw cotton represents a very large tonnage, 969,000 tons in 1916, the value being 85,000,000Z.Raw cotton was re-exported to the amount of 106,000 tons, the principal re-export being that of Egyptian cotton to the United States. Of the remainder it is estimated tnat one-fifth only is consumed in a manufactured state in this country. The export trade is of very great value, having amounted in 1916 to 118,000,0001. It is of primary importance from the exchange point of view that this trade should be maintained in lull volume.A reduction of the import of raw cotton would be desirable if arrangements could be made to^ secure either that it should have its effect in a reduction of stocks, or that any reduction of manufacture should apply -to articles for home consumption, and not to those for export. The problem is, however, one of extreme delicacy, since any measures taken with these objects might cause great disturbance affecting vast interests. [244-5] H
We recommend that the matter should be further considered, but we are not prepared to make any recommendations for present action.Any economies in home consumption would be an unmixed advantage, except so far as cotton goods were replaced by&apos;woollen or other materials. We suggest that reductions should be effected as far as possible, either by arrangements with the trade, as to the priority of manufacture as between the export and home trade, or in connection with the supply of labour, or by direct appeal to the public.92. There would be a substantial saving in tonnage and in voyages through dangerous waters, and also relief to the ports in this country, if Egyptian cotton were shipped direct to the United States of America instead of being re-exported from this country. This would, use tonnage which at present goes to America from the Eastern Mediterranean in baliast, and would release tonnage which could be used for bringing ore to this country. The stocks in the United States of America are large, and there are also considerable stocks in this country.We recommend that all export of raw cotton should be prohibited and licensed only to the extent necessary for supplying Holland, Prussia, and other Allied or friendly-countries.   The export to America should not be licensed.The result will probably be to cause a fall in the price of Egyptian cotton, which is at present excessively high. This may cause some dissatisfaction to those Egyptian cultivators who are still holding their crop ; but they will probably still be able to sell at a much higher price than the normal.93. We estimate the net saving of tonnage at 2,500 tons per month, this amount being included in the total of 10,000 tons under the head of Re-exports.(ii.) Jute.94. Imports of raw j ute are wholly derived from British India. The average annual import in the three years 1914-1916&apos; was 290,000 tons, the re-export having amounted to 86,000 tons. The amount retained and consumed in the United Kingdom is, therefore, approximately 200,000 tons per annum. In 1916 imports amounted to 238,000 tons, and re-exports to 78,000 tons.Jute is essentially not an article of luxury, but is necessary in the form of bags and canvas wrappings for the carriage of many foodstuffs; it is very important in connection with the export trade, especially in textiles. With a reduced import of timber, jute may be substituted for it to some extent for packing purposes.95. The supplies afloat and in stock in the United Kingdom amount, according to a census recently taken, to 200,000 tons, or about a years consumption.We recommend, accordingly, that shipment from India for consumption in this country should be reduced during the present year to 60,000 tons, the shipments being spread over this period as follows : Tons.February to July .. ...      .. .. .. .. ..     30,000August to December        .. .. .. .. ..     30,000The situation should be examined afresh in July, and if it appears that stocks are getting too low it may be necessary to increase the allowance in the second half of the year.96. ^The re-exports of jute from this country were in the past made up very largely of exports to the North of France. Stocks in that country are abnormally low ; but as we understand that France is now cbtaining supplies by direct shipment from Calcutta, and as Italy, Spain, and the United States of America are also obtaining supplies direct, the re-export trade has been reduced very considerably. With reduced imports, re-exports on any large scale would be undesirable, but we do not suggest that licensing for re-export should be altogether discontinued, as it is convenient to re-export to Scandinavia and Holland in limited quantities under control.97. We would further suggest that the distribution of unsold stocks and of future imports on private account (if any) should be controlled by the War Office in consultation with the Board of Trade, in accordance with a scheme which has been drawn up by the former Department.98. If no allowance is made for re-exports, the above proposals would effect a saving of import of 15,000 tons a month. But as some re-export will be unavoidable, and as the allowance for home use may have to be increased, we estimate the net saving at 12,000 tons a month only.99. Imports of jute manufactures during 1916 amounted to about 100,000 tons, of which some 25,000 tons were re-exported principally to Canada, the United States, and
Argentina. It is doubtful whether the cessation of re-export would result in any ultimate saving of tonnage, and we are not prepared to recommend any prohibition on the importation of these manufactures.(iii.) Hemp.100. We have carefully considered the possibility of reducing the imports into this country of raw hemp and manufactures of hemp (162,000 tons in 1916). In view, however, of the importance of that article for military purposes and for essential needs (e.g., rope for ships and binder twine), restriction would not, in our opinion, yield results proportionate to the administrative labour involved. There is a considerable re-export trade, which amounted to 39,000 tons in 1916. Half of this was sent to France and the remainder to Dominions and Allies. The prohibition of re-export would not result in any important saving of tonnage, since much of the hemp is required for essential purposes, and would be imported direct.Some saving of tonnage might be effected by importing larger quantities from nearer sources, ie., by importing more Italian and Prussian hemp, if supplies are available, and less Manila hemp.   This should be kept in view in the allotment of tonnage.(iv.) Wool.101. According to a recent census stocks of wool in this country are low, and in view of the heavy demands for military requirements it is not desirable to attempt any restriction of import.The War OfHce exercises control over the trade, and we understand that arrange-in en ts have been made whereby such supplies of wool as may be available after military requirements have been satisfied will be used, so far as practicable, for manufacturing goods for export. Manufacture for internal consumption is to be severely restricted to essential needs.(v.) Hjees and Leather. 102. The imports of hides and leather in 1916 were as follows : Tons.Wet hides        .. .. .. .. .. .. ..      38,500Dry hides .. .. .. .. .. .. ..      30,000Undressed leather (including tanned kips)   ,. .. .. ..      51,000* -  -Total (say)      &quot;.. .. .. .. ..     119,500This import has provided the supplies of leather necessary for military purposes&apos; and also those for indirect military and civil use and for the export trade. In addition, there have been re-exports of hides and leather to the extent of 15,000 tons.103. The military requirements for 1917 can, we are informed, be met by the following imports: Tons.Wet hides        .. ... .. .. .. .. ..      28,000Dry hides .. .. .. .. ..      52,000Tanned kips      .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       13,000Total   .. .. .. .. 93,000The above import, after supplying military needs, will provide almost exactly the same amount of leather for indirect military and civilian purposes as in 1916, but the re-export of 15,000 tons would not be provided for.104. The net result as regards imported tonnage of hides and leather will be a reduction from 119,000 to 93,000 tons, that is to say, a saving of 26,000 tons. This is produced by a reduction of 37,000 tons in the import of leather and an increase of 11,000 tons in the imports of hides.105. Our recommendations are :-1. Prohibition of the import of leather and exclusion of all leather, except the13,000 tons of tanned kips needed to provide for military requirements. 2. Prohibition of the import of hides and licensing of the amounts required, viz.,28,000 tons wet hides and 52,000 tons dry hides. 3. Prohibition of the export and re-export of hides and leather., ., . ^though it is proposed to increase the imports of hides by 11,000 tons, the pro-mbition of importation would be necessary in order to enable the War Office to regulate the import of the various classes of hides in accordance with military needs.We do not recommend any prohibition on the importation of goat shins, sheep stuns, and rabbit shins (dressed or undressed).   Imports of calf skins are unimportant.
106. In addition to the supplies of hides and leather from hides dealt with above, other leathers, chiefly skins, were imported in 1916, as follows : Tons.Boxcalf.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .,       1,100Glace kid .. .. .&apos;. .&apos;. .. .. ..      2,600Varnished, japanned, &amp;c.   .. .. .. .. .. ..        500Unenumerated    .. .. .-. .. .. .. ..      5,300Total     .. .. .. .. .. ..      9,500We recommend that these classes of leather should be prohibited and licensed, so far as required for export trade, or for essential civilian requirements.107. It is very desirable that any reduction in supplies resulting from the above recommendations should have its effect in the reduction of home consumption and not of export trade. This result can, we think, be best attained by arrangements with the trade.We understand that if, as we recommend below, the import of American boots is prohibited, there will probably be an immediate reduction in the manufacture of &quot; luxury &quot; boots.103. The above recommendations will result in a reduction of imports by about 2,500 tons a month in weight, and in value by about 7,000,0001. per annum.Boots and Shoes.109. Although boots and shoes are more properly dealt with under the head of manufactures, it is convenient to consider them here in connection with leather.In 1916 there were imported about 3,300,000 pairs (about 3,000 tons) of boots and shoes, of which about 60 per cent, came from the United States. The other chief countries that supply the United Kingdom are Switzerland and France. The imports amounted in value to about i,200,000Z.There were exported in 1916 some 16,000,000 pairs, valued at 6,400,000?., but this figure includes a proportion of military boots for Allied Governments.110. Whilst a substantial proportion of the output of those factories in England and Scotland which produce men&apos;s boots will be required for the Allied armies, few factories producing women&apos;s and children&apos;s boots have been taken over by the War Office. It should also be remembered that, as regards men now in the arnry, a military demand replaces a former civilian demand.It should, therefore, be possible to prohibit import without producing a shortage of necessary boots and shoes for the civilian nopulation even after maintaining the exnort trade at something like its present level.It has been shown that women can perform most of the necessary operations in the industry, and a further depletion of male labour would probably result in the increased employment of women.111. Should there be a serious rise in the price of boots for essential civilian purposes, e.g., for munitions workers, it would be possible for the War Department to secure production at reasonable prices.112. We recommend that the importation of boots and shoes of leather be totally prohibited, thus securing a saving of 250 tons a month, and over 1,000,000L a year.Partly-manufactured Materials for Boots and Shoes.113. We have been dependent on a number of imported articles, such as cut or shaped leather; eyelets and hooks ; knives, blades, groovers, and cutters ; nails and pins to fit American machines : needles and drivers; peg wood ; rivets and nails; tacks; wood shanks. The total weight of these articles was about twice that of the complete boots and shoes imported.The above articles are already on the Prohibited List under various heads, but it has not been possible to exclude them. We recommend that the existing policy be continued, but that there should, wherever practical, be increased stringency. Leather-parts should be totally excluded, with the exception of rolled welts for Italian boots and other supplies necessary for military purposes. The total saving is not likely to exceed 250 tons ner month.
(vi.) Mineral Oils. 114. Imports in 1916 were as follows:-Petrol Lamp oilLubricants      .. .. ..Total ... ..&apos; .. .. .. 1,327,000The above figures include import on direct Government account.Economies in the use of petrol have already been effected by the action of the Petrol Committee, and. also of the military authorities. We have not examined in detail the question of further economies in petrol, or in other classes of mineral oil consumption.115. We recommend that all possible economies should be enforced both in civilian use and also in use by &quot; privileged persons,&quot; as well as in consumption for military and naval purposes. We do not attempt to form any estimate of the extent to which such economy is possible ; and, as stocks are low, we consider that every economy, for the present at any rate, should be used, not to reduce import, but to increase stocks.(vii.) Summary.116. It may be estimated: that the recommendations in this Section will effect the following reduction in imports : 	Saving1 in Imports.	Arti e.				-*	Tons per Month.	Value per Annum.Raw jute Hides and leather           ..         .. Boots and shoes and partly  manufactured materials for boots and shoes ...

We have examined the possibility of imposing further restrictions on the importation of manufactured articles, both from the point of view of saving tonnage and of relieving exchange difficulties in neutral countries.The value of manufactured goods imported is large, but their tonnage is relatively small. Taking imports as a whole, their value per ton is about 221., whilst the average value of a ton of manufactured articles is 5U. It follows that con-siderations of exchange will have more weight in determining the&apos; restrictions to be imposed on this class of imports than considerations of tonnage.In the following paragraphs manufactured articles in which tonnage is the primary consideration are dealt with first. Expensive articles, where the tonnage consideration is almost negligible, are dealt with separately, and for convenience, a few other articles,&quot; such as feathers, which are strictly not manufactures at all, are dealt with in the same section.(i.) Bulky Articles. 118. From a tonnage point of view the most important articles under this head are : -Imports in 1916.Tons.Wood manufactures        .. .. .. .. ..       54,000Glass. .. ....        mm .. ...    149,000Painters&quot; colours.and pigments.     .. ...        .. ...      &apos; ..      61,000Paper has been deaft with separately.-[244-5] I
119. Wood Manufactures other sorts including Chip Boxes, Woodicare, and Turnery. In 1916 the value of the imports amounted to 1,839,000/.., and the principal sources of supply were the United - States, Russia, Norway, Sweden, France, and Holland. These articles are already on the prohibited import list, but there has been some difficulty in enforcing a rigid prohibition in view- of the necessities of industries in this country, particulaily the match and certain textile industries, and also because some of these manufactures come from France and Italy. We recommend, however, that efforts should be made to effect a reduction of 50 per cent, of the 1916 imports, unfinished articles necessary for industry (such as ply wood, bobbins, match splints, &amp;c.) being, so far as possible, included in the proportion licensed.120. Glass. The main sources of supply are Holland, the United States, Sweden, France, and Belgium. The importation of sheet, window, and plate glass, and glass tableware is already prohibited.Tableware (shown in the Trade Accounts under the head of Flint Glass) is now entirely excluded, except small quantities for the mounting trade which should still be licensed at the discretion of the Controller of the Import Restrictions Department. If, as has been suggested by the Board of Trade, all glass not already prohibited is now prohibited, there will be a saving exceeding 30,000 tons in comparison with 1916, the prohibition on tableware having been in force for the last quarter of the year only.The total imports of sheet and plate glass in 1916 amounted to 31,000 tons. The imports from Belgium, which had been authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government, appear to have been stopped for the present by the action of the enemy. We are committed to granting licences at the rate of 500 tons a month, but no licences are being granted for glass of these categories from other countries. Assuming that the Belgian imports are resumed, the saving compared with 1916 will amount to over 20,000 tons.Imports of glass bottles, which have so far not been prohibited, amounted in 1916 to 84,000 tons in weight and 968,0007. in value. We recommend that they should nowr be prohibited, and their import reduced by at least one-half, so as to effect a saving of 42,000 tons.121. Painters&apos; Colours and Pigments. 61,300 tons, of a value of over 2,000,000?., were imported in 1916. The principal sources of supply were Holland, the United States, and France. In view of the needs of the Admiralty and essential civil requirements, total exclusion would be impracticable ; but we consider that a considerable saving could be effected if tenants and landlords were released during the war from covenants requiring them to proceed with internal and external painting of houses at specified intervals, and if the requirements of the Factory Acts regarding periodical painting were suspended. We consider further that no external painting of buildings should be carried out except under licence from the local authority. Such licences are required in normal times for building operations, opening of streets, &amp;c, so that the necessary machinery is in existence. In the case of new huts, creosote oil, of which large quantities are available, should, wherever possible, be substituted for paint. Economy should further be urged on all Government Departments in the use of paint. Import should be prohibited, and licences should be limited to two-thirds of the quantities imported in 1916, the whole supply of barytes being obtained from this country as soon as possible.   The saving would be about 20,000 tons a year.122. Starch, Restriction of the importation of starch has been found impracticable, as it is indispensable for cotton manufactures and other industrial processes.123. Marble. At present Italian marble is subject to the prohibition which affects stones and slates, but has been licensed up to 50 per cent, of the 1915 import, for political reasons. In 1916, 19,400 tons, of a value of 161,000L, were imported. We consider that, this import should be stopped. The resultant saving is reckoned below as a saving for this section ; though strictly not a new prohibition, it was not taken into account in the estimate of additional saving likely to result from existing prohibitions..124. Tanning Extracts. It is proposed to prohibit the import of quebracho extract as well as of chestnut extract (which is already prohibited), in order to exercise control. There may be some saving in length of voyage, but probably none in actual tonnage imported.
133. Sewing Machines and Parts (413,000Z.) are imported chiefly from the States of America and Holland.   They are already on the prohibited list,134. Gilt Mouldings for Picture Frames (87,000Z.) are imported chiefly from Holland and Italy, and are already on the prohibited list; the stringency of the prohibition should be increased.135. Plated and Gilt Wares (value in 1915, 43,000Z.) are imported chiefly from the United States. It is possible that these articles may be covered by existing prohibi-tions, but we recommend that they should be placed specifically on the prohibited import list.136. Boots and Shoes have, for convenience, been considered under tbe head of leather.137. In value the saving over a period of twelve months resulting from the recom-mendations in this group would amount to nearly 5,000,000Z. The saving in weight would be only 500 tons per month.(B.) Articles largely affecting the Allies:138 The following articles which largely affect the Allies should also be subject to prohibition, if the diplomatic difficulties which may be anticipated can be surmounted.&apos; the value of the articles in question is so considerable that the reason for prohibition is oDvious.  In certain cases we recommend that licences be granted for a proportion of the 1916 import:- 8125. It may be estimated that:the monthly saving in respect of glass bottles, painters&apos; colours, and marble will amount to about 6,750 tons. The annual saving in exchange may be estimated at about 1,300,000?. j I........(ii.) Articles Important Primarily in connection with Exchange.126. From the point of view of exchange, it is most important that imports from the United States of America, and to a less extent from Switzerland, Holland, and other countries should be curtailed.(A.) Articles mainly affecting Neutrals.1.27. Embroidery and Needlework (value 3,248,000Z.).-Imports are almost wholly from Switzerland, and diplomatic difficulties are certain to be experienced in the imposition of any restriction.   We consider that, if possible, there should be absolute prohibition.128. Clocks and Parts. Imports (value, 227,0001) come predominantly from the United States of America, and we consider that they should be prohibited. We should have been disposed to recommend a similar prohibition on the importation of luatches and parts (value, 1,475,000Z.) other than gold watches, wdiich are ahead)?- excluded, but it has been represented to us that their manufacture takes place predominantly in the French-speaking portion of Switzerland, and we agree that it wrould, for diplomatic reasons, be unwise to impose any severe restriction.129. Photographic Apparatus. As articles of this description are not separately distinguished in the &quot; Official Trade Returns,&quot; their exact value cannot be stated. Photographic apparatus is imported chiefly from the United States of America, and we recommend prohibition.130. Incandescent Gas Mantles (value in 1916, 57,000Z.) are imported mainly from Holland. It is under consideration whether they can be produced in the United Kingdom.131. Cinematograph Films (value, 1,000,0001.) are imported chiefly from the United States of America, and also to some extent from France.   Import should be prohibited.132. Typeiuriters and Parts (665,000Z.) are imported from the United States of America, and it may be difficult to dispense with them altogether. The parts which, as &quot;hardware, are already restricted, must continue to be admitted in small quantities. We recommend prohibition of import of the complete typewriter, and reduction, if possible, by 50 per cent, of the 1916 amount.the United and werecommend that efforts should be made to reduce imports to 25 per cent, of the 1916 amount.

The value of imports of the above articles is no less than 23,000,000L, of which 5,500,0001 is from Switzerland, and 3,000,0001. from the United States of America. If our recommendations are carried into effect, it may be estimated that there will be an annual saying of imports of about 19,000,000Z. in value, and about 19,000 tons.in weight (1,600 tons a month).Appended to this report (Appendix II) is a statement showing the contributions of British Possessions and the principal Allied and neutral countries to the imports in question.HO. We further recommend that the importation of the following articles, which closely affect Japan, should be prohibited: Antimony loaves, baskets and basketware of bamboo, cloisonne icares, and [mats and. matting of rush. We also recommend that the existing prohibition on the importation of lacquered icares be enforced against goods of Japanese origin.141. We have not recommended any prohibition on linen yarns or manufactures, which come predominantly from Allied countries, but it may be thought advisable to insert them for-purposes of bargaining. Imports of linen yarns in 1916 amounted to 500 tons, of a value of 65,000Z. and linen manufactures to 900 tons, of a value of 376,000L142. Hitherto the policy of His Majestys Government, as regards prohibition, 1ms been hampered by arrangements or understandings with the French and Italian Governments, who have naturally opposed restrictions on some of their most important articles of export at the present time. These arrangements affect principally such articles as silk manufactures, hats and bonnets, marble, leather gloves, feathers, fancy goods, wine and brandy.All Allied and neutral countries of importance enjoymost-favoured-nation treatment in the United Kingdom as regards the treatment of their imports, and it has therefore been difficult whilst admitting French or Italian goods to exclude similar manufactures of other countries.143. The attitude of the Japanese Government has not differed from that of the French and Italian Governments. They have shown considerable impatience at any proposal to place restrictions on their manufactures, even when imports into the United Kingdom
of such manufactures were small compared with similar imports from other countries. Thus it has not been practicable to impose any prohibition on Japanese silks or hosiery. Yet the value of Japanese silk imported into the United Kingdom amounted to only 1 600,0007. out of a total import of silks amounting to 12,900,000?. As regards cotton hosiery, the Japanese trade has developed during the war. In 1916 the total import amounted to about 3,500,0007., the greater part of which came from the United States. Imports from Japan amounted to 1,237,0007.It may be mentioned in this connection that the Treasury have on several occasions refused credits asked for by the Belgian and other Allied Governments for the purchase of cotton hosiery in the United States. This refusal has been based on the ground that other forms of hosiery could be furnished from home sources in adequate quantities, but it will clearly be difficult for them to maintain this attitude if cotton hosiery of foreign manufacture is admitted for civilian consumption. &apos;It is very desirable from the exchange point of view to exclude so important an import from the United States, and it is hardly reasonable that this should be prevented for the sake of the smaller trade from Japan.144. With regard to Switzerland the position is not&apos; less difficult. A large part of the country is contiguous to Germany, and the sympathy of the population is pro-German. On the other hand, it is considered undesirable frr political reasons to alienate the French part of Switzerland, which is well disposed towards the Allies, and is engaged in the manufacture of munitions for them. Nevertheless, important industries, which it is proposed to restrict, are carried on largely in that part of the country. In view of extensive purchases which are being made in Switzerland by the Allies, it is important to take steps for improving&apos;the Swiss exchange. It has been suggested to us by the War Office that it may be possible to find employment for a considerable section of Swiss industry in war work for the Allies requiring a high degree of skill. -We trust that this suggestion will not be lost sight of.It has been stated that, whilst Switzerland does not complain so much of a general prohibition, she resents the imposition of restrictions on her manufactures which do not apply equally to France. The fact is thnt either French goods take the place of Swiss goods, and so the volume of imports into this country is not reduced, or concessions have to be made to Switzerland with a similar result.The Swiss articles principally affected are silks, cotton hosiery and lace, straw hats, and embroidery and needlework.145. We strongly recommend that steps should be taken to secure the release of this country from any understandings of the nature indicated above which there may be with the French and Italian Governments, and that efforts should be made to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement with the Japanese Government.146. It must be remembered that at present, as a measure of reciprocity, British goods of prohibited descriptions are licensed freely by the French Government for admission into France. This privilege would, of course, be lost if the imports of French goods into this country are restricted.147. It will have been observed that ostrich feathers (value 403,000?.), which come from South Africa, have been placed in this group. It is most undesirable to allow this trade to continue under present circumstances; but, as South African interests are involved, we recommend that a communication on the subject -should be addressed to the Government of the Union before action is taken.(hi.) Miscellaneous. 148. It has been suggested to us that the importation of skins and furs, whether dressed or not, which are clearly intended for manufacture into articles of luxury, should be prohibited. Skins and furs, other than calf, goat, sheep, rabbit, or seal, are classed as &apos; unenumerated&quot; in the Official Trade Returns^ About 50 per cent, of the imports are re-exported. The undressed skins come principally from the United States, to which country most of the re-exports are shipped. The dressed skins come from Russia.. China, and the United. States, and are re-exported principally to the United States and France. It has not been possible for us, in the time at our disposal, to consult with the interests concerned, and we fear that indiscriminate prohibition* Imports in 1916 of these articles were as follows :-Dressed skins, 2,300 tons : value 7o0,000Z. Undressed skins, 7,000 tons: value over 2,000,OOOZ.[244-5] K
may but serve to curtail a valuable trade. We therefore make no recommendation on the subject.The above remarks apply also to seal shins, imports of which are not large, and could not well be treated differently from those of other valuable skins and furs.149. It has been suggested to us that a prohibition should be placed on animal ivory, of which imports in 1916 amounted to 530 tons, of a value of nearly 500,OOOZ. The imports are, however, chiefly from British Possessions and the Belgian Congo and four-fifths is re-exported.   We do not therefore recommend prohibition.150. Imports of motor-cars, motor-cycles, and parts, which are on the prohibited import list, are allowed under licence only for military or other essential purposes. We under-stand that steps are being taken to increase the stringency of the prohibition, so far as possible.151. The importation of rubbertyres, rubber boots and shoes, and other articles of rubber from the United States is governed by the Rubber Agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the interests concerned, by virtue of which the goods in question are exported from the United States to neutral countries in Europe only by way of the United Kingdom. In view of.the importance of this agreement from the point of view of the Blockade, and the desirability of not in any way impairing its working, we are of opinion that prohibition would be inadvisable.152. Imports of cutlery, hardware, implements and tools, and machine tools are already subject to regulation, but in some cases it may be possible to effect further reductions.153. Imports both of cotton yarn and cotton textiles, which are already on the prohibited list, should be further reduced. In the case of yarns the interests of India would render total prohibition impracticable.(iv.) Summary.154. The saving that may be anticipated on bulky articles included in this Section (viz., glass bottles, painters&apos; colours and pigments, and marble) may be estimated at about 6,750 tons a month, and on articles important primarily in connection with exchange at some 2,100 tons a month. Allowing for tare in the use of articles other than marble and painters&apos; colours, the total monthly saving would not be less than 10,000 tons.The annual saving in exchange may be estimated at about 25,000,0001. in all.Except in the case of marble, no allowance has been made for additional reductions in imports of articles already prohibited, allowance for such reductions having been made elsewhere.SECTION VI. RE-EXPORTS.155. It has been suggested that a large saving of tonnage might be realised by prohi-biting, save in exceptional circumstances, the importation into the United Kingdom of goods for re-export, on the ground that such ^oods are not required for our own purposes, and should be obtained at their own risk by those who require them. Two specific administrative acts would be necessary, viz. : (a.) An order prohibiting the re-export of goods not subject to an existing prohi-bition of export; and (6.) An order prohibiting the importation of the goods in question, and thenlicensing up to the amount allowed or required for home consumption.156., In, view of the large volume of the re-export trade (1,500,000 tons in 1916), the proposal has been carefully considered by us; but, after an examination of the most important, articles affected, we are convinced that any general policy such as that outlined would yield little result and would be inexpedient. Where in specific instances our recommendations involve a curtailment of re-exports, such curtailment is incidental to, and not the primary object of, a restriction of imports.The reasons for our conclusion may be summarised as follows :  1. In many cases there would be no saving in actual length of voyage by direct shipment to destination instead of indirect shipment via, this country.   Even where there is an increase in length of voyage, there may be no effective saving in tonnage, since there is no lack of space in ships outward bound from the United Kingdom to -the most important destinations.
7, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,&apos; Februaru 10, 1917.E. H. MARKER (Secretary).It is true that in such cases there would be some advantage in relief to tbe ports ; but on the other hand such relief would be dearly bought if it meant, as it might in some cases, the permanent diversion of a valuable trade.2 In a large number of cases (a few are given below) there are special reasons which make it undesirable to stop the re-export trade.Qq-jJqq._Re-export from stock is directly advantageous to exchange, and there isplenty of space in outward-bound ships.Jute is re-exported largely to France for military purposes.Tin comes from the Malay Peninsula and is re-exported largely to the United States of America. His Majestys Government have been anxious to reduce so far as possible American encroachment on a British trade.Rubber manufactures are for reasons of Blockade sent to this country from the United States for re-export toother countries.Oil seeds are re-exported in large quantities to Holland,.and are there manufactured into products (margarine and glycerine), returned eventually to this country.3. From the point of view of exchange the re-export trade is advantageous (a) in so far as it facilitates the shipment to foreign destinations of produce largely British in origin, and (b) in so far as it involves profit to the middleman in this country. But, if goods produced in the Empire were shipped direct, and the transaction were financed in this country, the loss from an exchange point of view would be inconsiderable.4. It is probable that, for the following reasons, the existing policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government will in fact bring about a considerable reduction in re-exports and in corresponding imports, without direct restriction of re-exports as such : (a.) A prohibition of exports covers re-exports; a number of such prohibitions have recently been imposed for the purpose of conserving supplies of particular commodities in the United Kingdom owing to possible shortage. In 1916, 139,000 tons of rice were re-exported, but that commodity is now on the list of absolute prohibitions and a considerable proportion of the corresponding import will probably be realised as a saving.(b.) An important part of our re-export trade has been to our Allies, notably France and Italy, but &quot;there is a growing tendency to economise tonnage by shipping supplies direct to. the Allied countries.157. It is difficult to estimate the amount of the net saving likely to be effected as a result of the circumstances indicated under heads (a) and (b). but it is not likely to be less than 10,000 tons a month. In this total there is included an estimated saving of 2,500 tons in respect of Egyptian cotton (vide Section IV, sub-section (i)).158.

fAPPENDIX I.The Saving in Imports estimated to result from Restrictions on Brewing.The Output of Beer Restriction Act was designed to secure a reduction in the amount of beer brewed to 26,000,000 standard barrels in the year ending the 31st March, 1917. Tins represents about 928,000 tons of barley, 54,000 tons of grits, and 116,000 tons of sugar. It is understood that the Commissioners of Excise anticipate that the quantity brewed will, in fact, probably exceed the 26,000,000 barrels by half a million barrels or more; but the actual excess which will be realised cannot at present be stated, and in the figures below the excess brewing has been neglected.Assuming that part or the whole of this use of materials in brewing were stopped, the question arises how much would thereby be realised by way of a saving on imports.For this purpose it will be convenient to start with the assumption that the whole use of brewing materials is stopped.As regards the grits (which are for the most part maize, rice, and other imported articles) and the sugar, the whole of the saving of materials could be realised as a saving of imports. These particular materials are. substantially all imported, and their import could simply be stopped, since they are not needed for other purposes.As regards barley, part of this is imported and part home-grown. In the three years just before the war (ending the 30th September, 1914), the average import of barley for all purposes was 1,050,000 tons, while&apos;the average home supply of barley was 1,400,000 tons. Since the war both the home-production of barley and the import have fallen very largely, the amount available for the year ending the 30th September, 1916, being about 1,100,000 tons of home produce and 880,000 tons of imported barley. The import during the calendar year 1916 was 790,000 tons.Assuming that the use of the whole 928,000 tons of barley in brewing were stopped, this could, broadly speaking, all be realised as a saving of tonnage (a.) Directly in the stoppage of imports of barle)^ (which would cover 790,000 tons in 1916);(6.) Indirectly as to the balance of 136,000 tons, by utilising the barley to mix with wheaten flour in bread, so as to save wheat; or by utilising it as feeding-stuffs, so as to save imported feeding-stuffs.The foregoing general result needs modification in respect of the loss of brewers&apos; grains, malt culms, and dried yeast produced in the process of brewing. These are valuable feeding-stuffs : 928,000 tons of barle)&apos; would give about 274,000 tons of these feeding-stuffs, which would need to be replaced directly or indirectly by other imports. It would not be fair, however, to deduct the whole of the latter figure in estimating the saving of imports, since brewers&apos; grains and malt culms are very bulky feeding-stuffs in proportion to their food value.&apos; An equivalent amount of food can be obtained in maize weighing five-eighths of the brewers&apos; grains, i.e., about 171,000 tons as against 274,000 tons.In so far as realisation of the saving on barley depended upon substituting barley for wheat in making flour, there would be a loss from the point of view of human food, because barley cannot be milled into flour up to so large a percentage of the total grain as wheat. But there would be a compensating gain of animal food. If the barley is milled up to 60 or 70 per cent, only, while wheat is taken to 80 or 85 per cent., there is a correspondingly greater return of barley offals available for feeding-stuffs. This correction, therefore, is alternative to and not cumulative on the correction above.There would, of course, be certain difficulties of transition in substituting one feeding-stuff for another, and it might be necessary to make some allowance for this, but the allowance would not affect the general character of the results shown in this memorandum.The broad result emerges that it should be possible to realise as a saving of tonnage substantially the whole of the volume of brewers&apos; materials (amounting to 1,098,000 tons) less only the 171,000 tons in respect of imports required to replace brewers&apos;grains and malt culms ; that is to say, 927,000 tons a year.This figure should be increased through the three following corrections : (a.) As stated above, the actual amount of beer that will be brewed in the year ending the 31st March will probably exceed the 26 million standard barrels by half a million or more. Taking the excess at half a million, the possible saving of imports through the total stoppage of brewing should be increased by aoout 2 per cent., or. 18,000 tons.
(b) In 1916 there was an export of malt practically equivalent to 33,000 tons of barley. The stoppage of this export, and of the use of barley for the purpose of making malt, would therefore yield a further saving of 33,000 tons.(c.) Any stoppage or considerable restriction of brewing should be accompanied by practically total-prohibition of the import of hops, this amounting in 1916 to over 7,000 tons.If these additions are made, the saving of imports that could be realised by the total stoppage of brewing and malting would amount to 985,000 tons a year, or 82,000 tons a month. Any reduction of the volume of brewing less than total prohibition would bring about a proportionate saving of imports.APPENDIX II.Value of certain Articles Imported into the United Kingdom during 1916 and 1916.(In thousands of pounds.)       _ ,Articles.Total Value of Imports from all Sources.1916.1915.Value of Imports in 1915.33 03CDaoFrom Allied Countries.From Neutrals.0 oa33 CD42c5acSCD M 42  CC-a ap^53COHiec342 42CD 3cS S3OEmbroidery and needlework ..

APPENDIX III.Sir Thomas Whitaker to Sir Albert Stanley.Royal Commission on Paper,Central Rouse, King sway. London, Dear Sir Albert, January 12, 1917.Referring to my interviews with you with regard to the necessity for further reducing the imports of paper, and particularly of strawboard and packing and wrapping paper, this Commission, on the 10th instant, very fully and carefully considered the whole matter.The restrictions which have thus far been enforced have imposed very considerable inconvenience upon the trade, but the requirements of this Commission have been most loyally responded to, with the result that up to the end of last year the Commission had been successful in reducing the total imports of paper and materials by some 32-?,-per cent. A further reduction of 50 per cent, is now being made, and was to be continued during this year. I understand, however, that the necessities of the situation require a further reduction. The Commission therefore desires to say that if the Government come to the conclusion that the reduction in the total imports of paper and paper-making materials shall be increased to an extent which will, as a whole, make the total import 40 per cent, of the importation of 1914 that is to say, a reduction of 60 per cent. this Commission will do its best to carry out that decision.The Commission would propose to do so by arranging that the importation of paper and paper-making materials should be, for the coming year commencing the 1st March next, one-third less than the importation in 1916, which teas already one-third less than 1914. This arrangement it would propose to apply to all kinds of paper and paper-making materials except those descriptions which appear in the Board of Trade Returns as 1. Paper for packing and wrapping. 2. Strawboard.3. Millboard and wood-pulp board.4. Boxes and cartons of paper or cardboard.With regard to these particular descriptions, the Commission propose to make the reduction, as compared with 1916 importation, 50 per cent.The effect of reducing paper and paper-making materials generally by one-third of the importation of 1916, and strawboards and packing materials by one-half of the importation of 1916, would be to make the total reduction for the coming year equivalent to a reduction of 60 per cent, on the importation of 1914. As strawboard, packing paper, &amp;c, are now very largely used by the Government for munitions, supplies of food, &amp;c, a reduction of the import to 50 per cent, of 1916 would very effectually curtail the general use of these materials.In making this suggestion the Commission desires to say that this reduction will involve great inconvenience and loss, and in many cases much hardship on many persons and branches of the trade. It feels sure that the reduction will not be ordered unless it is really necessary, and the Commission desires to express the opinion that if it is ordered, no further reduction in the importation of these articles and materials should be contemplated by the Government until some similarly sweeping reductions have been made in the importation of other articles which, in the opinion of this Commission, can be more easily and advantageously dispensed with than is the case with paper and paper-making materials.Should you decide that this reduction must be made, I have to suggest that it is very desirable that the decision should be come to as soon as possible, in order that the trade may be notified and the Commission^; regulations for carrying it out may be drafted at once, so that the inconvenience caused to the trade by issuing an alteration of recently revised regulations may be limited as much as possible.Yours very truly,THOS. P. WHITAKER.
