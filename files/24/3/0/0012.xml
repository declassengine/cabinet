Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET.TRANSPORT GENERALLY.Note by Lord Mtlner.THE difficulty of maritime transport is undoubtedly the question uppermost in the minds of all Italian Ministers at the present time. Their anxiety centres on supplies of coal, steel, and grain. There is a threatened shortage bf other imported goods also, but these seem the only vital ones. Accompanied by Mr. Roy den 1 had a long talk on this subject with the Ministers of Transport, Finance (Treasury), and Agriculture, on Monday, the 8th January. The discussion involved a large number of technical points, with many of which Mr. Royden was already familiar. It was evident that it was impossible to deal with them adequately at a conference of this kind. I therefore suggested that the Minister of Transport should furnish me with a com-prehensive memorandum reciting briefly all Italy&apos;s most urgent requirements in respect of tonnage, and any suggestions he had for the way of meeting them. I gave of course no promise of our being able to satisfy all Italy&apos;s wants, but confined myself to assuring him that whatever we could possibly do to help Italy having regard to the great shortage of tonnage for all the Allied countries, and the fact that Great Britain had, besides supplying her own absolute necessities, to help all the rest-should be done.The memorandum I asked for was sent to me at the Embassy just before my departure. It was in Italian. I handed it to Mr. Royden in the train, and one of our Italian fellow travellers translated it to him. He said he thoroughly understood all the points and would himself draw up a memorandum showing how far they could be met.I think these papers should be obtained from Mr. Pioyden and filed with this note in the Cabinet archives.(Initialled)      M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 16, 1917.o
