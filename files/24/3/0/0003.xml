Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET. G-103.NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF ON THE ORGANIZATION OFPROPAGANDA.(Previous Papers Nos. (3-101 and G-102.)1. The Propaganda Section of the General Staff was reorganized in February, 1916. Its functions were to produce information of all kinds connected with the war which might be serviceable as propaganda or as material for propaganda. It also took over the examination of propagandist material produced by the Germans. With this object in view the following arrangements were made : -1. A staff of voluntary writers was got together, consisting of officers serving in this countrv and of civilians.j2. An officer wras employed to obtain from official sources matter dealing withthe British effort from every point of view, and to write this up in a formwhich, after censorship, might be publishable. 3. Arrangements were made with. General Headquarters, British ExpeditionaryForce, Cairo, and Mesopotamia, and with the G.Q.G., France, for the supplyof propaganda material.2. The examination of German propagandist material was organised as follows :-  1. Examination of the Press.2. Examination of German propagandist literature.3. Examination&apos; of German cablegrams intercepted on British wires and the German wireless messages.The object of this examination is to analyse the German propaganda, to ascertain its aims, and thus to provide writers (among whom are included those who produce telegraphic material) with subjects and material for counter-propaganda,3. Recently, steps have been taken to secure the services of competent foreign writers able to translate propagandist articles into good literary language acceptable for publication in the Foreign Press.4. Such, then, are the means at the disposal of the General Staff for the production of material. They are by no means inconsiderable, even at present, but they are capable of almost unlimited extension at no expense, since the services of practically all journalists and men of letters under 41 are now at the disposal of the War Office. Many of these, owing to wounds or ill-health, are only fit for light duty, and they are only too ready to lend their pens for progagandist purposes.5. The difficulty which has been experienced by the General Staff in the preparation of material, has been in obtaining definite information of the causes which favour the Allies or their enemies in different countries, and of. the channels into which local public opinion should be led. In addition to this they feel that their efforts could have been more usefully employed if they could have been kept in more regular touch with the fluctuations of public opinion abroad, and if more information could have been supplied to them of the effect of the material produced by them, and of the methods, working and success of the German propagandist agents in foreign countries.When the reorganization took place in the spring of this year, it was laid down that the function of the General Staff was to supply material for military propaganda. Its distribution abroad and the policy (other than military) governing its supply was the function of the Foreign Office.[173-1]fe  6
The General Staff readily recognize the assistance which has been rendered to them by the latter department and by Wellington House, who have furnished them with all the information which lay at their disposal, and it is far from their desire today any blame on those or any other departments. The conduct of British propaganda has, however, been impugned from many sides, and it would appear necessary to lay a finger on the root of the disorder, which would seem to lie in the fact that no machinery provided by any existing public department is adequate to deal with this question.As has already been observed, the General Staff have failed to procure the definite information and guidance which appears to them essential for the proper preparation of material, but from such information as has reached them, they cannot help thinking that a considerable improvement might be effected in our propaganda campaign by a thorough reorganization of its conduct. They are strengthened in this view by the. last report received from Wellington House, which, in the sections dealing with America, Sweden and Holland in particular, shows that the opposing influences continue to be remarkably powerful, and but little ground is given for belief that the sentiment displayed in favour of England has increased.The great fault of our propaganda system seems to be the lack of connection between: (a.) Sources of information as to the nature of propaganda required. - (6.) The producing agencies ; and   -(c.) The distributing agencies.If these three branches could be brought under one control, very considerable improvement could be effected.6. It is proposed in the first place that,&apos; recourse should again be had to the suggestion put forward by Sir P. Brade at the Conference held at the Home Office on 26th January, 1916, to the effect that a separate establishment ought to be set up under a responsible head, to which the various departments could be closely allied, and on which they should be represented through an Advisory Committee, set up for the purpose of considering questions of policy. .If such a Propaganda Office were formed, it is proposed that an officer should be appointed as Director, and provided with the necessary staff.7. The Director should not be responsible for the policy of propaganda, which should be regulated by thg, departments concerned through the Advisory Committee, but his duties should be (a.) To keep in touch, through his own agents and by every other means, with the state of opinion in foreign countries, to watch the activities of German propaganda, to study opportunities for British propaganda and to determine the best methods for carrying it out.Note. It would be largely on this information that the Committee would decide the policy of the propaganda in each country.(b.) The control of the distribution of all propaganda abroadNote. It is thought that the Propaganda Service should while making full use of existing agents establish, where necessary, its own agents. In the first place, the Diplomatic and Consular Services are already so busy that they have , scarcely the time to devote to an efficient propaganda campaign. Moreover, the work of a good propaganda agent is of a rather equivocal description, and there, are aspects of it which are hardly compatible with the dignity, of His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Agents abroad, and which, therefore, they cannot carry out satisfactorily.Again, the employment of regular Secret Service agents has its disadvantage. Propaganda is open work, as a rule, and the work of Secret Service agents is not. A Secret Service agent who combined propaganda with his other activities is likely to compromise himself, and this would impair his efficiency in both connections. Therefore, it is better to have separate agents for propaganda, who, however, should be in communication with consulates and missions, and, therefore, able to communicate in cipher wuth London(c.) Suggestions for the preparation of material for propaganda purposes.Note. The General Staff have a large staff engaged in this work. It would be necessary to retain a number of them for the preparation of material based on information supplied only by the General Staff. Some could -conceivably be released, but it would probably be more advisable, since they are officers, to keep in touch with them through the War Office.
(d.) The translation of articles into foreign languages. The Director could arrange this either through (a.) His agents abroad, or (6.) At home.flote. It would be a question to decide which procedure is most desirable. In the case of (a), the Director should make the necessary arrangements through his agents. In the case of (6), it would probably be best, at first at any rate, to utilise the General Staff translation section. This must in any case be maintained for military purposes unconnected with propaganda.(e.) Visits, interviews, special facilities, &amp;c., of Press and other representatives, whether British or foreign.Note.-There are only a limited number of these, arrangements for which can be made by the War Office and the Admiralty.It should be the business of the Director to select and submit to the Committee the names of those from whom most advantage can be obtained by according facilities, and these facilities can then be obtained by the Departments concerned.(J.) Foreign News Services.Note. The arrangements with these agencies should be in the hands of the Director; the news should be supplied by the departments concerned, being collected and collated by the Propaganda Office.(gf.) Examination of German propagandist material.Note. At present this is conducted mainly by the General Staff; probably, at any rate at present, it had better remain there, but the Director should be in touch with the various War Office sections concerned and should assist them in their work by information as to the Propaganda Office&apos;s necessities.8. The personality of the Director is a matter vital to the success of the scheme. He must possess tact and imagination and a wide acquaintance with foreign countries. He should be a man of position, but at the same time not of such high official rank as would make him unlikely to brook the control of the Committee, nor should he be a serving official of one of the Government Departments.9. To be efficient the Advisory Committee should be small, since rapidity of action is as essential in propaganda as in otner work connected with the war. Probably the best thing would be to have four regular members the Chairman and representatives of the Foreign Office, War Office, and Admiralty. The members should not be merely telephones between the Propaganda Office and their own department, but responsible officers, capable of giving decisions and able to give a coherent judgment as to the policy of propaganda as a whole, and not only as regards their separate departments. Representatives of other departments, such as the Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Blockade, Board of Trade, India Office, and Colonial Office, who are directly concerned in propaganda, should attend and be consulted when matters touching their departments arise.The Committee should meet frequently and should be instructed to do everything in their power to secure co-ordination in all branches of propaganda.The Director would not be a member of the Committee, but would attend all its meetings and be responsible for carrying out the policy laid down..10. It would be necessary to exercise considerable care in the selection of a Chairman, who should not be a member of any Government Department mainly concerned in propaganda. The Chairman should, if possible, be a member of His Majesty&apos;s Government other than an Under Secretary.11. It would be necessary that the Propaganda Office should be attached to a Government Department in order that one of the Ministers might be responsible to Parliament.General Staff,23rd December, 1916.
