rThis Document is the Property of-His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1917.CONFIDENTIAL. ^ .G.-134,ALLIED CONFERENCE AT PETROGRAD, JANUARY-FEBRUARY, 1917.Report to Lord Milner by; Mr G. R. Clerk.(Previous Papers Nos. G.-130, G.-131, G.-132, and G.-133.) Mr. George Clerk to Lord Milner.My Lord, E.M.S. &quot;Kildonan Castle&quot; March 1, 1917.THE reports which your Lordship has received from Lord Revelstoke, General Sir Henry Wilson, aud the Munitions Committee, and your own memoranda and records of conversations with Russian statesmen and people of importance, in conjunction with the proces-verbaux of the actual sittings of the Conference, will give His Majestys Government a complete record of the work done, and the results achieved, by your Lordship&apos;s Mission to Russia, Any further report from me, therefore, might seem to he merely adding to the mass of papers, especially as no move was made by the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to discuss any of the matters which more directly affect the Foreign Office. Your Lordship would, however, probably wish that the conver-sations which I had respecting Poland and Roumania should be placed on record, as in a sense included in the work done by the Conference, and I may perhaps be allowed to submit some short observations on the Russian situation as it appeared to me, con-sidered, not so much in direct connection with the war, as from its bearings on our political relations Avith Russia in general.Poland.I annex (Enclosure 1) a summary of my conversations with the Polish leaders in Petrograd, together with papers written for me by Count Wielopolski and Count Sobanski in Petrograd, and Prince Matthias Radziwill in Moscow. The latter represents the ultra-Polish party, and, though recognised as an ardent and patriotic Pole, is regarded by the Central Polish Committee as somewhat visionary and unpractical. The Central Committee, the bulk of whom are now collected in Petrograd under the presidency of Count Wielopolski, can be fairly taken to represent the best and most sensible Polish opinion, and their views are, by their own admission, fairly stated in the record of my conversation. These views are also, so far as interrupted commu-nications allow of so definite an assertion, those of the two most-trusted Polish political representatives abroad, M. Roman Dmowski in London, and M. Seyda in Lausanne (the latter a German Pole). In the multitude of Polish agents and self-appointed committees, I think there is no doubt that this Central Committee is the one that speaks with most authority, and that takes the most practical view of what .is possible for Poland, and how it should be attained. It is true that the Galician Poles, with their happier experiences of Austrian rule, are not yet whole-heartedly at one with the Russian and German Poles, but they are beginning to realise more and more what is, in my humble opinion, the first essential in any advance towards Polish unity and independence, namely, that the initiative depends on, and must come from, the Russian Government, unless Russia herself, of her own volition, and without pressure from other Powers, otters all the Poles a measure of independence, such as that outlined in the Emperor&apos;s announcement to Count Wielopolski, Poland can never start fair on her progress to self-government.Great importance therefore attaches to the decisions of the Committee of Ministers and high officials, including M. Sazonoff, whom the Emperor has just appointed to consider the Polish question.   The prospects of a satisfactory report to the Emperor are good m the sense that M. Sazonoff, one of the foremost advocates of Polish autonomy, aamits that events have moved so far that now what he had considered sufficient for oiand is much less than what will have to be accorded.   Moreover, the Emperor nisell, with whom the final decision rests, is the most sincere friend whom the Poles [373-1] B
have in Russia. On the other hand, every other Russian dislikes and distrusts the Poles, and I shall he agreeably surprised if the finding of the Committee does not propose limitations which will considerably detract from the value of their gift to Poland. There is also another danger, in that the Duma, whose President, M. Rodzianko, is one of the members of the Emperor&apos;s Committee, is agitating for a discussion of the Polish question in their House. If this is allowed, Poland will become a political plaything among the various parties, and I fear that the result can only be disastrous. I say &quot; disastrous &quot; deliberately, for unless some solution of the Polish question that will satisfy sensible Polish opinion can be offered, and offered soon, not only will Germany succeed in obtaining use of the greater part of Polish man-power, with consequences that are obvious to all, but at the end of the war Poland will remain a ready instrument for German aggression, and a potential cause of further war.It will, however, not be enough that Russia should make a satisfactory offer or promise to Poland. The second essential is that whatever is offered must be counter-signed by the Allies. Only with this guarantee will the Poles have any trust in Russia&apos;s promise, while they are so starving for political liberty that they will, failing Russia, accept Germany&apos;s offer, like a man dying of thirst, who will drink a cup of water though he knows it to be poisoned. It will not be easy for the Allies to get Russia to accept their counter-signature in a form strong enough to satisfy the Poles, but it must be done, and can, in my humble opinion, be fairly insisted upon when the Committee reports, for an extension of Poland under Russia&apos;s aegis into Austria and Germany is most undoubtedly an international question.Roumania.I annex a record of a conversation which I had with M. Bratiano. It contains the substance of what he said to your Lordship and to one or two other members of the Mission, and needs no comment here. I may, however, call attention to the evident intention of Russia to leave Roumania to shift &quot;for herself at present. Your Lordship will remember that this came out clearly in the conclusions of the Military Committee, as read to the Conference, and that, when you raised the point that economic considerations should not be left out of account in the preparation of strategic plans, and emphasised the importance of denying the rich cornfields of Wallachia to the enemy, the reply was that each Higher Command was individually free to attack where it would, and that strategic considerations were the dominant factor. This is an incontrovertible military principle, but I doubt whether the Russian decision was guided by that alone, and I fear that the economic and political results of practically leaving Roumania alone during the present year may have serious consequences for the Allies. It is significant that Professor Struwe, the chairman of the Committee for the Restriction of Enemy Supplies, probably the best working organisation in Russia, in an independent conversation, urged the enormous importance of an offensive through Roumania, for economic reasons.Silver for Persia.The only directly Foreign Office question that was raised during the stay of the Mission in Petrograd was a request made by M. Bark at the Financial Conference of the 7th February, for silver to pay the Russian troops in Persia. This is a complicated subject, and one which means a good deal more than appears on the surface, as it is really one of the many efforts made by the Russians to weaken the position of the Imperial Bank of Persia in favour of the Russian Banque d&apos;Escompte. The particular point brought up by M. Bark was referred to the Foreign Office, and I need not discuss it further here.Decorations.The British Mission were authorised, as an exceptional case, to accept decorations, should the Russian Government confer them. In consequence, some eighteen members of your Lordship&apos;s staff have received Russian decorations, all of them of a relatively high order. I submit that the permission given to the British delegation implies that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to confer corresponding distinctions on Russian officials who have either taken an active part in the Conference, or been of direct service to the Mission, and it is clear that this is the view of the Russians themselves, who have handed in to the French, Italian, and British delegations a list of those officials to whom decorations should be given, together with a note of the class of order which each individual should receive. There are also a certain number of Court dignitaries and naval and military officers who cannot be omitted from any
pneral distribution of decorations. I trust, therefore, that it will be recognised that fr-ha distribution is unavoidable unless we are Xo incur serious odium in Petrograd, Snd that the actual number and class of decorations may be worked out as soon as possible in conjunction with His Majestys Ambassador in Petrograd.General Observations.When the Mission left England, the position in Russia appeared to be dominated bv the possible effects of the assassination of Rasputin. When we arrived in Petrograd, e found that, beyond a general feeling of relief that there was one obnoxious and noisome personality the less in the world, nothing had really been changed by the murder, and the only definite result appeared to be an inclination to doubt the value of assassination as tempering autocracy. This situation is typical of the whole position in Russia to-day. Every member of the Mission heard from all sides, Russian and foreign, of the inevitability of something serious happening ; the only question was whether the Emperor, the Empress, or M. Protopopoff would be removed, or perhaps all three. Meanwhile, it was generally agreed that there must be no revolution during the war, and short of revolution, or more murders, no one could say how the power lor evil of the Empress was to be broken. The open way in which people of all classes, including those nearest the throne and officers holding high military commands, spoke against the Empress and her two blind tools the Emperor and M. Protopopoff-was, to one who knew anything at all of Russia, extraordinary. But what to me was almost more remarkable was the manner in which the Mission was kept in a sort of ring fence and prevented from hearing any defence or serious explanation of the Emperor&apos;s policy. To some extent this was no doubt due to the reluctance of the reactionaries to give the Mission any excuse for discussing the internal affairs of Russia, but that in turn was, to my mind, largely due to the way in which the liberal and anti-governmental faction endeavoured, and I think with some success, to use the Mission as a demonstration in favour of the principles for which they are fighting. Meanwhile, the fact remains, that until the present Minister of the Interior loses the Emperor&apos;s favour, he is the most powerful man in Russia, and it is with him, or a successor of like tendencies, that we shall have to reckon until the war ends.I do not believe that there will be a revolution before the war is over, unless maladministration and happy-go-luckiness succeed in producing a jacquerie, which is most unlikely. I must, however, admit that I am probably in a minority in this opinion, certainly in Russia (see the annexed record of your Lordships conversations with M. ChelnakofE and Prince Lvoff at Moscow). The most serious thinkers in Russia, and those who would head an organised revolution, are opposed to it, and many of the people who now indulge in the wildest talk against the Emperor and his entourage are really, like the assassins of Rasputin, trying to save the monarchy in spite of itself. They are ready to use any chance weapon to this end, and there is no doubt that great hopes were built on the advent of the Mission. As an extreme instance, it was largely believed in Petrograd that the Allied Mission intended to offer the supreme command of all the Allied Armies to the Emperor, with headquarters in London, thus necessitating his temporary departure, together with the Empress, from Russia, and the appointment of, obviously, a liberal-minded Regent. Again, considerable efforts were made to induce the Mission to postpone its departure until after the day fixed for the re-opening of the Duma, the 27th February. I am personally convinced that it would have been a mistake to do so, for either the reactionaries would have again postponed the opening, thereby inviting serious trouble, 0] j ^uma.&apos; faking advantage of the Mission&apos;s presence and the consequent reluctance m the Russian Government to provoke a scandal, would have gone to such lengths as to make repression unavoidable, and the Allies would have left, &quot;indelibly tarred in the eyes of Russian autocracy with the Liberal brush.I venture to repeat that so long as the war lasts, the Allies have to work with the imrperor and the Ministers whom he appoints.   It does not much matter whether it is rotopopoft or another-the tragedy about M. Protopopoff is that, in appointing him, me Lmperor thought he was really pleasing the Liberal party.   But whoever it is he in lun the Russian Government on its old lines, more or less efficiently according to ms individual temperament; but it is with a Government moving on those lines that - nave to work, and all that we can expect form Russia is the best that such a j veinment can produce.   It is idle to count on more, and useless to try to drive in Uover      t be1Jter.metnods- &quot;There is only one real remedy for the vices of the Russian nment, that is, to scrap the whole machine.    But this is just what we cannot
Enclosure 1.mI HAVE had some long conversations with the principal leaders of the Russian Poles, especially with Count Wielopolski, Count Zamoiski, Prince Liebomirski, and Count Sobanski.   The gist of them can, however, be very briefly summarised.The danger, in the opinion of these Polish leaders, that actually threatens both the Allies, and Poland itself, at the present time is the intention of the German Government to form a Polish army, which can amount to some 1,400,000 men between 18 and 50 years of age.If, however, the Germans attempt to force conscription on the Poles and to enrol them as units of the German forces, the Poles themselves, although their resistance will no doubt be crushed relatively soon, manu militari, will oppose the German endeavour by all means in their power.On the other hand, if Germany announces her intention of creating a separate, purely Polish, army under Polish command, and organised throughout by Polish officers, there is considerable risk of her achieving some, if not complete, success ; more especially if the announcement comes from the Polish Government already organised by the Germans.Germany does not, however, wish, if she can avoid it, to create this double-edged weapon, nor, equally, is she anxious to take the risk of applying coercion unless and until she sees no other way out.Meanwhile, the German Government appear to be marking time, and rather relying on the natural pressure of want and hunger to secure, if not Polish soldiers, at least Polish workmen, who will free Germans for the front.This being so, the German interest being not to hurry matters, the Polish leaders feel that the best course for Russia and her Allies lies in immediate action. They consider that an announcement of an intention to create a real Polish army, proclaimed by Russia and counter-signed by the Allies, would certainly make the realisation of the German plan out of the question. In this case, it would be the best possible guarantee to the Poles themselves and to the world at large for the future independence ol Poland. But to create this army and make it a success, there must be a definite act o State from Russia, supported by the ARies.Count Wielopolski laid great stress upon the fact that the somewhat vague an large terms in which the Emperor recently defined the future of Poland as His Majest,afford to do ; we have not time nor money enough to create a new up-to-date machine and the old one, if carefully used and not too roughly handled, can still do much good and useful work, and our task is to get the best of that work out of it.We should also bear in mind the fact that in a country such as Russia, where there is no real system, and no complex organisation, personality counts for far more than anything else. R does not matter whether we send a field-marshal or a second-lieutenant to do a particular job ; if whoever is sent happens to possess the indefinable something which attracts the Russian, he will be able to do almost anything with them -but if he has not that gift and it is impossible to predicate it in advance no matter how good and advantageous the system which he has to inaugurate may be, the Russians will see that it never has a chance of working properly.Lastly, it is to my mind all important to finish the war with the minimum of friction and the least possible sum of mutual grievance between Russia and Great Britain. The first impression I had on arriving in Petrograd was that the Russians  the Government-were afraid of us, the British Mission. They were courteous and hospitable beyond expression ; but, though the almost open hostility of General Gourko and Admiral Roussin was the exception, the general attitude was one of anxious expectation, and I think the Mission can fairly claim that in that respect at least the Russians were agreeably disappointed. Personal contact has made for good relations, but Russia is a woman Avho has long had Germany for a master, has grown weary and broken away, not to stand alone, but to find a new mate; she is ready, and even anxious, to find such a one in Great Britain ; but the strain of war has revealed features which gave her pause, and she may yet, unless very delicately handled, return to her first love.I have, &amp;c.G. R. C.
- a if namplv &quot; its own State constitution with its own Legislative Chambers and conceived n, uauioi^,       ^ ii -i 1 -i    i   -   j^  own \rmy &quot; was the best formula that could be devised. ?This statement is at present merely an expression of the Emperor s personal &apos; &quot;on  and before it could acquire the nature of a State document it has to be Emitted to the Council of Ministers,   The Polish leaders fear that the chance of the formula emerging unscathed, if it ever emerges at all, from the Council, are remote,d that in any case the delay necessitated by discussion in the Council will be fatal. aD   The Polish leaders are therefore very anxious that the Emperor should be induced to issue his statement as his own Imperial will; they know that in reality that is the ly thing that counts in Russia at the moment, and certainly- that among the RussianonGovernment the Emperor is the only real friend that the Poles possess.The Polish leaders would wish, I understand, that the heads of the Allied Missions be able to influence His Majesty in this sense ; but this, as well as the even more difficult question of the counter-signature of Russians Allies, must depend upon what the chiefs of the Allied Missions consider to be the interests of the Allied Powers as a whole, upon the opportunities that they may have of discussing the question with His Majesty, and upon the consideration whether any form of pressure from outside in regard to Poland is not calculated to do more harm than good to the Polish cause. But in^Poland itself such a counter-signature will have an enormous effect, and will confirm the firm belief and trust of the Poles in the Allies which existed, and still remains, though weakened, since the beginning of the war.I think, however, that the above is a fair statement of the action that the most epresentative Poles in Russia consider best calculated to put the affairs of Poland on the right path.I should add that as regards the limitation of any Russian pronouncement to the above formula, it is important to avoid raising such questions as that of personal union under one Sovereign in a concrete form, for to the ordinary Pole, a figurehead in crown and ermine robes is a symbol of independence, and, if the question is raised, the Pol themselves will be at variance, and the Germans. will profit by the opportunity to nominate a puppet princeling as the so-called independent King of Poland.There is a further project of creating amongst the Polish refugees in Russia and the Polish prisoners of Austrian and German nationality, the cadre of a Polish army, so that when peace comes there will be an effective guarantee that Poland will, so far as its own defence and administration are concerned, be able to take its place forthwith in the family of nations.* G R CFebruary 16, 1917. &apos;    &apos;(B.)Memorandum by Count Wielopolski, February 16, 1917.LES partages de la Pologne, qui avaient pour but d&apos;aneantir 1&apos;ancienne Repu-!merne polonaise, et dans leur consequence de germaniser oti russifier le peuple polonais, sont une fois de plus une preuve quil est impossible de faire disparaitre une nation qui a son passe, son histoire, sa culture, sa langue.

Entre les paroles et les laits il y avait cependant des divergences trop visibles. La politique de la bureaucratie russe ne changeait en rien dans le Royaume de Pologne ; les lois de restrictions contre tout sujet russe d&apos;origine polonaise, de religion catholique, ne subissaient non seulement des changements, rnais etaient executees dans rEmpire dans toute leur rigueur ; l&apos;occupation momentanee de la Galicie etait une orgie pour le bureaucrate russificateur on 1&apos;ortliodoxe guerroyant. Rien n&apos;a pu faire croire anx Polonais que la politique russe a l&apos;egard d&apos;eux etait vraiment changee et que la Russie avait adopte sous ce point une nouveile ligne de conduite.Si nous y ajoutons encore les declarations faites dans les Chambres legislatives par de differents Ministres Goremykine, Sturmer, Sazonoff, Pokrovski. Trepoif nous voyons un manque absolu d&apos;une politique claire et honnete de la part du Gouverne-ment russe. Tantot on dit moins, tantot plus ; on parle d une autonomie restreinte, dune autonomie large, d une Pologne libre et unie ; on revient sur ses propres paroles; et la question polonaise reste sous un point d&apos;interrogation non seulement &quot;pour les Polonais, mais pour les Russes eux-memes, pour les Allies, pour les neutres, pour le monde entier on pourrait dire : meme pour le Ministre de demain.An moment on Ton s&apos;y attendait le moins, la question polonaise prend une tournure nouvelle et nette. Deja plusieurs fois et a diiferentes occasions Sa Majeste 1&apos;Empereur de Russie s&apos;etait exprime dune facon bienveillante et large sur 1&apos;avenir de la Pologne. Le 12 decembre, 1916, dans 1&apos;ordre du jour adresse a 1&apos;armee et a la marine, les paroles Imperiales ne laissent plus aucun doute sur les desseins du Souverain, surtout si l&apos;on prend encore en consideration les indications que Sa Majeste a bien voulu donner au Comte Wielopolski, au cours de son audience du 23 decembre : &quot;Une des conditions de la panv doit etre la creation d&apos;une Pologne libre, formee de ses trois parties actuellement separees.&quot; Le mot &quot; libre &quot; doit etre interprets : &quot; La Pologne formera un Etat, avec ses Ghambres legislatives et son armee&quot;Cette parole est claire, ne pent et ne doit plus laisser de doute, nadmet pas d&apos;equivoques.II nous serait impossible, dans une notice aussi breve que celle-ci, d&apos;expliquer les differents courants politiques qui out pu regner parmi les Polonais pendant les trente mois que dure la guerre.   Quelques remarques sont cependant absolument necessaires.La majorite de la nation polonaise s&apos;etait declaree deja en 1914 pour la victoire de la Russie et de 1&apos;Entente. Ce sentiment etait moins dicte par une animosite plus grande de TAllemand que du Russe, moins par une comparaison des moyens employes par les deux oppresseurs de la nation polonaise, que par un calcul froid et reflechi. Ii faut bien se rendre compte qu&apos;en politique, tout aussi bien que sur chaque autre terrain d&apos;action, ce ne sont ni les amities d&apos;un jour ni les names et animosites qui doivent decider, mais c&apos;est 1&apos;interet seul qui doit etre le iacteur et le mobile d&apos;une ligne a suivre, et ce n&apos;est qu&apos;alors que toute politique peut etre tranche et claire.L&apos;Allemagne victorieuse, c&apos;etait pour chaque Polonais la perte a tout jamais du Grand-Duche de Posen, de la Prusse polonaise, de la Silesie polonaise et meme autri-chienne, cela etait en meme temps 1&apos;abandon de la possibility d&apos;une sortie sur la mer. La revenclication de ces terres pour une Pologne creee par les Allemands, meme dans le cas si la Galicie y etait incorporee, devenait a tout jamais impossible; leur germanisation aurait ete menee d&apos;une tfacon qui ne connait pas de scrupules. La victoire allemande peut bien creer un Etat-tampon polonais, un royaume entrant dans 1&apos;orbite des pays vassaux de la Prusse, meme un Etat politiquement relativemeut independant,. mais du point de vue economique ruine, exploite par 1&apos;Allemagne-jamais elle ne peut nous donner la reunion des terres polonaises et une liberte sans restrictions.Tout ce qui a ete dit plus haut etait connu par les Polonais encore avant 1914, e&apos; c&apos;est ce qui a influence Tattitude de la majorite de la nation ; c&apos;est la raison pou laquelle anjourd&apos;hui encore dans le Royaume de Pologne la plus grande partie de 1 population reste neutre, mefiante aux projets allemands.II serait, cependant, faux de croire quun revirement dans 1&apos;opinion polonaise n puisse avoir lieu. L&apos;attitude du Gouvernement et de la bureaucratie russe, don nous avons parle dans la premiere partie de notre notice ; le silence si prolonge de Allies a Pegard de la Poiogne, dicte par une prudence peut-etre trop exageree 1&apos;isolation du Royaume de Pologne, creee par les Allemands ; la presence de nouvelle tendancieuses, controlees et censurees par Berlin; la famine et la misere, qui regnec tout aussi bien chez fe riche que chez le pauvre, tout cela peut bien influence Topinion publique.D&apos;apres des donnees serieuses que nous possedons, il est certain qu&apos;aujourd&apos;h
encore la majorite de la nation ne s&apos;illusionne guere sur les menees allemandes et voit clair dans son jeu. Mais pout-on kisser les Poionais seuls sans appui latter contre la perfidie de 1&apos;ennemi, le souvenir du regime russe et de ses consequences ? Vest-il pas a crainclre que 1&apos;isolement et 1&apos;abandon dans lesquels on les laisse ninfluencent, avec le temps, 1&apos;attitude meme des plus equilibres?Les interets de la Pologne sont du cote de la Russie et de 1&apos;Entente, mais si nous nous trouvons uniquement en presence de faits contradictoires ou de promesses vagues et incertaines de ce cote-ci, on procede, du cote oppose, a la creation d&apos;un royaume, modeste mais libre, on y respecte la langue et la religion, les institutions locales, on tend a former une armee polonaise, on appelle le pays a la vie sociale et politique. Meme pour ceux qui regardent les menees allemandes ,d&apos;un ceil craintif et critique, il faut avouer que la comparaison entre les actes allemands et les promesses russes est en faveur des premiers. Pourrait-on done s&apos;etonner qu&apos;un jour 1&apos;opinion publique polonaise ne se declare pour le regime allemand, pour sauver, aupres du plus fort, les vestiges de nationalite, que le Gouvernement russe, malgre des promesses, n&apos;a su. respecter meme au moment de 1&apos;abandon du pays a 1&apos;ennemi ?L&apos;existence de la nation polonaise, de 28,000,000 de Polonais, habitants dhine contree fertile, industrielle, riche avant la guerre, ne peut etre indifferente a 1&apos;Europe entiere. Du reste, ce sont les chefs des Gouvernements francais et anglais qui ont etabli tout dernierement encore que la reconstruction de la Pologne etait necessaire pour 1&apos;equilibre europeen. Nous croyons que les paroles d&apos;un Asquith et d un Briand, appuyees par Boselli, n&apos;ont pas seulement ete envoyees au Gouvernement russe pour etre entendues pas les rares Polonais qui auraient voulu s&apos;enroler sous les drapeaux des legionnaires, au service du Kaiser. Nous esperons que c&apos;est par leur bouche que 1&apos;Europe a manifeste vouloir intervenir dans la question polonaise non seulement d&apos;une maniere platonique. Mais alors pourquoi garder plus longtemps un silence, qui complique la situation, et qui, interprets dans le sens qui lui donne 1&apos;Allemague, pourrait avoir pour consequence fatale d&apos;ebranler encore aujourd&apos;hui 1&apos;equilibre, dont il a ete question plus haut ?Les voix qui nous parviennent du Royaume de Pologne, du Duche de Posen et meme de la Galicie demandent secour et appui, elles demandent a la Russie et aux Allies un programme clair et franc clans la question polonaise. On ne s&apos;est tu que trop longtemps; un dicton russe dit: &quot; Une perte de temps equivaut a la mort.&quot;L&apos;equilibre europeen maintenu par la resurrection de la Pologne n&apos;est pas seulement un vain mot. Nous supposons qu&apos;apres la constatation de ce fait par les plus eminents hommes politiques de 1&apos;Entente, nos paroles ne pourraient avoir quhine modeste importance. Nous ne pouvons pas, cependant, nous, empecher de constater que dans le conflit qui se dejoue sous nos yeux il y a, d&apos;un cote, 1&apos;Allemagne, deTautre la Russie deux Empires qui sedisputent la possession des terres polonaises. L&apos;objet des partages, de la communion sacrilege dont parlait Frederic le Grand, et qui devait sceller 1&apos;amitie des deux Puissances, a revecu non plus comme un fantome, mais a pris corps et ame. La question polonaise n&apos;occupe pas seulement 1&apos;esprit des hommes d&apos;Etat de 1&apos;Europe, mais aussi ceux d&apos;outre-mer. La Pologne ne peut plus devenir un objet de trafic, ses voisins ne peuvent plus se tendre la main sur sa tombe la Pologne est devenu pour eux un etre vivant. La Russie a tout interet a la faire revivre : grande, unie, independante. Sa mission d&apos;etre le defenseur et le protecteur des Slaves ne pourrait se realiser ni au centre de rEurope- ni sur les Balkans, si elle continuait a ignorer 1&apos;existence de la nation slave, qui, apres elle, occupo numeriquement la seconde place dans le monde. L&apos;Allemagne appelle la&apos; Pologne a la vie ; elle la veut pour elargir sa domination dans TEurope centrale, pour creer un nouveau vassal de la Prusse. L Autriche ne compte plus depuis le jour ou elle est de venue un jouet dans les mains allemandes. L&apos;Europe, le monde entier, qui cherche dans la liberte des nations une solution dans la crise que nous traversons, a tout interet a prevoir a ce que la Pologne ne reclevienne pas un objet de convoitises, un objet de nouvelles complications, et peut-etre de guerres nouvelles. 11 faut resusciter le corps d&apos;une nation qui, meme apres quelle ait ete rayee de la carte de 1&apos;Europe, a donne et donne les preuves d&apos;une vitalite sans pareilies. La Pologne ne peut pas appartenir a 1&apos;Allemagne ni entrer dans son orbite, elle ne peut pas etre une province russe elle doit etre rendue a elle-meme, unie et libre.La reconstruction d&apos;une Pologne, des trois parties separees dans un royaume uni et mdependant, cela serait le programme autour duquel se rallieraient tous les Polonais, de tous les ^partis politiques, de toutes les classes sociales. Ce programme proclame par la Russie, il s&apos;entend que la Pologne aurait ete dans une convention avec la Russie ;
cette convention donnerait aux deux pays 1&apos;assurance qu&apos;il serait impossible a 1&apos;Allemagne de continuer a 1&apos;avenir une politique d&apos;expansion pacifique ou celle d une agression armee contre un des deux pays slaves. II faut, cependant, compter encore en ce moment avec certaines nervosites, certaines craintes et surtout avec la psychologic russe. Le Russe se soumet facilement au sort, a 1&apos;imprevue meme, mais il lui est difficile de faire un effort qui, meme dicte par son propre interet, lui ferait abandonner, de son propre gre, certaines formules surannees, certaines idees qu&apos;il s&apos;est faites, un etat de choses qui lui paraissait bon et stable. Le Russe evolue lentement, et il a , besoin qu&apos;on le convainque de la necessite de cette evolution. II ne faut pas le brusquer ni dans les faits ni dans les paroles, et c&apos;est pourquoi nous trouvons qu&apos;en ce moment-ci il faut sarreter textuellement, sans changer un mot aux paroles du Souverain russe, qui onfc eu leur echo dans le Grand Empire. II ne faut pas dire autre chose, il ne faut pas preciser plus. Nous trouvons qu&apos;il vaudrait meme mieux ne pas employer le terme dunion personnelle, qui serait du reste daccord avec les paroles dites par 1&apos;Empereur de Russie, mais qui serait immediatement souleve par TAllemagne de facon a creer de nouvelles complications. La Pologne doit etre reunie de ses trois parties separees actuellement; elle dpit avoir son proprs Gouvernement, ses Ghambres legislatives, son armee et former un Etat libre. Voila la formule que la nation polonaise espere et dont elle attend la proclamation officielle par la Russie, proclamation qui doit 6tre acceptee et soutenue par les Allies. Ge sont eux qui doivent aussi dire, a 1&apos;exemple de la Russie, que c&apos;est devenu un des buts de la guerre actuelle, une des conditions de la paix, et que 1&apos;existence de cette Pologne libre sera garantie par eux poor maintenir 1&apos;equilibre europeen.II faut, cependant, encore donner une valeur reelle aux paroles, et il faudrait que le jour ori un acte de ce genre paraitrait il y ait certaines mesures prises par le Gouvernement russe. Pour 1&apos;appui de ces paroles il faut des faits il n&apos;est plus le temps des prom esses vagues et incertaines.   II faudrait done :1. Une loi (en vertu du ^ 87) qui abolirait a tout jamais les lois de restrictions, auxquelles sont soumis les sujets russes d&apos;origine polonaise et de religion catholique.2. Une decision, mettant fin a de nouvelles nominations d&apos;employes russes, destines a occuper des postes dans le Royaume de Pologne. (Des nominations de ce genre ont eu lieu encore tout dernierement.) Cette meme decision etablirait une liquidation de la bureaucratie russe, evacuee du Royaume de Pologne et etablirait la fagon de remettre a 1&apos;avenir la question des affaires du royaume dans les mains des Polonais.Ces mesures devraient etre prises dans le delai le plus court, elles devraient etre publiees simultanement avec 1&apos;acte dont nous venons de parler, et qui reglerait dans les lignes generales 1&apos;avenir de la Pologne.Notice. Tout sujet russe, d&apos;origine polonaise et de religion catholique, est prive dans 1&apos;Empire de certains droits dont jouissent les autres sujets. 11 existe, en outre, certaines lois d&apos;exception pour les niemes personnes dans les Gouvernements de Lithuanie, Podolie, Volhynie, &amp;c. II s&apos;agit d&apos;abolir ses restrictions, qui toutes ont ete introduites apres l&apos;insurrection de 1863. Nous nous sommes heurtes a 1&apos;opinion que les Polonais demandent en meme temps la liberte pour leur patrie et des droits a 1&apos;egal des Russes en Ruesie. Rien n&apos;est plus faux. II ne peut etre question des Polonais, qui seraient les habitants indigenes de la future Pologne. L&apos;avenir reglerait leurs droits en Russie tout comme il reglerait les droits des Russes en Pologne. II y a cependant des territoires qui ont appartenu a 1&apos;ancienne Republique polonaise, terri-toires qui ne sont pas polonais, qui ne feront pas partie de la future Pologne. Sur ce territoire habite bon nombre de Polonais y etablis depuis des siecles, y ayant leurs fortunes, leurs interets, qui resteront sujets russes. Cest pour eux ainsi que pour ceux qui ont emigre en Russie que nons demandons 1&apos;egalite des droits, Tabolition de toutes les restrictions introduites seulement apres la derniere insurrection, et qui les privent, comme nous 1&apos;avons dit plus haut, vu leur origine et leur religion, de la plenitude des droits civils.(C)Memorandum by Count Sobanski, February 15, 1917.UNE tranche et nette declaration, de la part de la Russie et des Allies, concernant Tavenir de la Pologne shmpose des a present en reponse des menees et des actes allemands.   Plus la situation des Empires du Centre sera menacee, et plus ils feront
rimpossible afin d&apos;exploiter a leur profit les reserves d&apos;hommes que possede encore la Pologne, employant pour atteindre leur but tous les moyens de contrainte dont lls disposent. Soutenir la resistance des Polonais contre les pieges que leur tend l&apos;astucieuse politique allemande est la tache d&apos;aujourd&apos;bui. La Russie semble aussi 1&apos;avoir compris. Elle voit enfin 1&apos;ineluctable necessite de baser des aujourd&apos;hui, et en vue de son propre interet, ses bons rapports a venir avec la Pologne sur le programme de &quot; 1&apos;union des trois parties d&apos;une Pologne libre et independante,&quot; maintenue dans 1&apos;orbite dhnterets communs aux deux nations, -sans preciser encore pour le moment la question du trone. R semble done acquis que la question polonaise, par la force des choses est devenue dorenavant une question internationale et, par la meme, elle se posera&apos;comme telle aux deliberations du futur Congres. Aussi bien, les declarations deja faites a ce sujet par les Premiers Ministres de France, d&apos;Angleterre et d&apos;Ralie out statue que la question polonaise, et notamment la creation dun  tat polonais libre, compose de ses trois parties reunies, est une-des conditions du futur equilibre europeen. Ceci implique une commun.au te d&apos;interets entre la Pologne et les Puissances alliees qu&apos;il s&apos;agira de regler, lorsdu Congres, a la satisfaction reciproque des parties. Mais, sans parler du peu de confiance qu&apos;inspire aux Polonais 1&apos;idee que leurs interets puissent etre deiendus par la Russie au plus grave tournant de leur bistoire, il est positivement a craindre que la longue dependance dans laquelle la Pologne s&apos;est trotrvee vis-a-vis de la Russie ne diminue aux yeux de cette derniere 1&apos;importance des interets primordiaux. du nouvel Etat polonais, dont elle se verrait la protectrice et le porte-voix. Les interets des deux pavs limitrophes ne pouvarit pas etre toujours identiques, la Russie pourrait facilement oublier ceux de la Pologne en vue de les subordonner aux siens. Cest iei que la vigilance des Puissances allies occidentales fera bien de se tenir en eveil. Oar, pour devenir un facteur reel d&apos;equilibre pour 1&apos;Europe, le nouvel Etat polonais ne pourra se passer des conditions indispensables a son entier et solide developpement interieur, ainsi qua sa large expansion economique au debors. Cest pourquoi Fun et 1&apos;autre devront lui etre assures par sa structure politique et geographique. Ces conditions une fois remplies, la Pologne deviendra le trait d&apos;union naturel entre les interets economiques des Puissances alliees et le grand marche de 1&apos;orient slave, sphere quasiment monopolisee jusqu&apos;a la guerre par 1&apos;activite industrielle et commerciale du monde germanique.II y va done du plus grand interet des Puissances d&apos;inviter des Polonais en qualite d&apos;experts a prendre part aux debats concernant 1&apos;arrangement futur de 1&apos;Europe, chaque fois que les interets vitaux de leur pays seront mis en cause.La connaissance approfondie que seuls ils possedent de leur pays, de ses richesses naturelles, des ressources economiques dont ils disposent, de ses possibilites latentes, enfin des conditions de son developpement agricole, industriel, commercial et financier, rend leur concours indispensable, personne en dehors d&apos;eux n&apos;etant a meme de renseigner les Gouvernements allies sur 1&apos;ensemble complexe du probleme polonais.En meme temps que sur 1&apos;organisation politique, le futur Congres aura a statuer sur les frontieres de la Pologne, sur la necessite absolue de son acces a la mer, ses charges financieres, ses traites, ses relations commerciales. Afin de trancher et d&apos;arreter ces questions, on ne pourra pas se passer de 1&apos;opinion des gens connaissant a fond les faces multiples des questions a resoudre.Aussi, n&apos;est-il point admissible que les Allies, combattant au nom de la liberte et du bonheur des nations opprirnees, veuillent decider arbitrairement du sort d&apos;un pays de 22,000,000 d&apos;habitants situe au centre de 1&apos;Europe, sur la lisiere meme de la Russie et de l&apos;Allemagne, et destine de tous temps a la defense de 1&apos;Orient slave contre les poussees formidables et brutales du monde germanique,&apos;dun pays possedant 1,000 ans d&apos;histoire ainsi qu&apos;une ancienne et riche culture.En consideration des raisons developpees plus haut, le seul fait de ne plus figurer ofhciellement sur la carte d&apos;Europe depuis un siecle et demi comme Etat independant, suffit-il vraiment pour priver la Pologne du droit d&apos;envoyer ses propres representants au prochain Congres, qui decidera de tout son avenir?La difficulte du^ probleme a resoudre consiste a trouver une forme qui, sans hoisser les susceptibilites clu Gouvernement russe, permette aux representants attires de la Pologne de prendre place a cote des delegues beiges, serbes et montenegrins. U, de fait, les interets quils y representeront&quot; sont-ils de moindre importance, au point ne vue international, que ceux defendus, par exemple, par les delegues ponugais, auxquels, cependant, le droit de sieger au Congres ne sera pas conteste par personne. - ^Si le droit de sieger dependait de la somme de souffrances et du degre de sacntice vaillamment supporte dans le courant de cette guerre, certes la Pologne y aurait [373-1] D
fconquis ime premiere place destinee qu&apos;elle fut par sa situation politique et geographique a en etre la plus tragique victime: son sol fut ravage par les marches, contre-marches et les luttes acharnees des trois armees les pins formidables du monde, tandis que ses fils, combattant loyalement aux cotes des Russes, accomplissaient une ceuvre d&apos;extermination fratricide envers leurs propres compatriotes enroles dans les rangs ennemis.Mais, comme il est a prevoir que les questions principales a debattre au Congres seront discutees avant que la Pologne soit liberee du joug allemand et, par la meme, avant que la nation polonaise puisse, par la voie d&apos;un Gouvernement regulier, faire entendre sa voix devant 1&apos;areopage des Grandes Puissances, il faudrait, pour remedier a ce mal, s&apos;entendre avec le Gouvernement russe afin qu&apos;il fut permi aux Polonais de choisir ces delegues-experts parmi ceux d&apos;eiitre leurs compatriotes etablis actuellement soit en Kussie, soit a 1&apos;etranger, dont le devouement a la cause des Allies, les qualites personnelles, ainsi que les situations responsables occupees par eux anterieurement a la guerre, seraient autant de garanties de leur hon sens politique, de leur competence et de leur ponderation. Ces conditions se trouveraient aisement chez bien des membres du Comite national polonais.Cree a Varsovie des le debut des hostilites et compose d&apos;hommes appartenant aux partis politiques les plus importants, d&apos;opinions moderees, le Comite national polonais crut faire son devoir en quittant Varsovie au moment de la retraite de 1&apos;armee russe et transporta son siege a Petrograd. II le fit afin d&apos;avoir la possibilite de defendre les interets de la Pologne, tant aupres du Gouvernement russe qu&apos;aupres des Puissances alliees, ce qui ne lui fut pas loisible en restant a Varsovie apres 1&apos;occupation allemande.Plusieurs des membres du Comite national polonais, libres de voyager en pays allies, ont eu l&apos;occasion d&apos;entrer en relations directes avec les homines d&apos;Etat les plus eminents de Grande-Bretagne, de France et d&apos;Italie. Cest eux encore qui, avec le concours d&apos;un groupe de compatriotes sujets autrichiens et allemancls, mais franche-ment hostiles aux interets des Empires germaniques, ont cree a Lausanne un centre dhnformations et de propagandes polonaises. Enfin, le Comite national polonais s&apos;est menage, par la voie de la Suisse, des intelligences suivies avec les trois parties de la Pologne. Deployant de cette maniere une saine activite, il a su eviter les ecueils auxquels les organisations politiques de 1&apos;emigration ont rarement echappe.Tout cela assure au Comite national polonais une autorite reelle et permet de le considerer comme le representant d&apos;une majorite eclairee de 1&apos;opinion politique polonaise, sans cdmpter que parmi ses membres se trouvent tous les deputes polonais aux Cbambres legislatives russes actuellement presents a Petrograd.- II va sans dire que, si le moment donne, une representation officielle de la Pologne pouvait etre formee et reconnue comme telle, elle remplacerait les delegues provisoires mentionnes plus haut.Petrograd, le 1&apos;2 fevrier, 1917.(D.)Notes on the State of Public Opinion among the Poles.(Information given by Prince Matthias Radziwill.)THE expediency of periodical visits and intercourse between the Allies is generally recognised as the condition of a well-combined action, not only of military and economical but also of moral forces.In the present situation Poland is in all cases a factor in this action. An inter change of opinion between the Allies as regards Poland has become a necessity.The political situation of the&apos;present hinders this work. The Allies have no direct contact with Poland, and this country is thus exposed to the influence of the Central Powers.The influence of the Coalition reaches Poland only through the Poles actually separated from their mother-country, and officially only through the medium of Russian enunciations.Any declaration made by Russia is powerless to inspire the least faith, all the more as it reaches Poland in the abnormal conditions now reigning in Warsaw.
It might he expedient to meet the existing needs and thus to secure the Polish asset for the benefit of the Coalition. .....It will perbaps.be of some interest to the English delegates now visiting.Moscow, and deprived of the possibility of direct contact with Polish public opinion, to have information as regards the state&quot; of mind of the evacuated multitude which presents the only moral link between Poland and Russia.It mav be added that only we can give information up to a certain point as to the state of minds in the Polish country.I will not enlarge on the aims of Poland. It is easy to say what must be the object of a nation of 25,000,000, fully conscious of her national existence and the history ofher former State. ....The Poles are not blind as to the real conditions of the present. Public opinion is mostly guided by the instinct of conservation and the dread of possible dangers, the avoidance of which is considered as a first duty.It will perhaps throw a light on the psychology of the Poles if we enumerate the various apprehensions in the order corresponding to the degree of their gravity.All the Poles without exception are firmly persuaded that the greatest danger threatening their national existence lies in the eventual return of Russian armed forces in their country.Independently of even the most favourable circumstances, the aforesaid eventuality would complete the act of destruction committed during the evacuation.Every single Pole believes that the return of Russian armed forces will deprive us of any guarantee of the fulfilment of given pledges.This remains a positive fact, unless the Poles Russian subjects be re-established in their political, religious, and civil rights equal to the rights of the rest of the Russian citizens.Personally I do not think the Russian Government of to-day or to-morrow &quot;will be be equal to act with the broad-mindedness and clear-sightedness implied by this wise step. This unique and sincere turn in the treatment of the Poles would undoubtedly and miraculously act on the opinion of the whole Polish nation.An impending return of the Russian army is the only thing that might drive the Poles to an act of sheer despair, and a decision contrarj^ to the political line of action instinctively adopted by the majority.Even the few Germanophile elements in our country, who are guided by opportunism, dread a compromise with the Germans, apprehending a consequent diminution of the state of our possessions.The reasons of a forced compromise can only be the impending return of the Russian army or an obviously unjust delimitation of our territories.The Poles believe in the possibility of reuniting Galicia and the kingdom, but the majority is doubtful as to the future of the lands annexed by the Germans The political situation in Russia, the character of the nation and the dynasty, allow us to foresee the danger arising from a bond created by the eventuality of a Russian Sovereign or even the same dynasty,  iIn regard of the enumerated apprehensions, it would, perhaps, be expedient to find a way for the Coalition of acting directly on Polish public opinion. It would be an error lightly to lose Poland, whose defection would only be a forced act of self-preservation.On the contrary, the Coalition might strengthen Poland by the recognition of the new kingdom, and support the work of the rebuilding of the young State advancing rapidly in Warsaw.The Poles have found two points of contest as regards the Russians.The first doubt arises out of the question of the east frontiers of the future Poland ; the second concerns possible guarantees as to the community of political aims.The instinct of conservation and the national tradition of the Poles are a sufficient guarantee as regards the second point; touching the first, I can say the Poles pursue an honest ethnographical delimitation.I may add that the Poles will find less difficulty to come to an agreement with the dynasty and the political parties of the Right and Extreme Left.I he Progressive party in Russia is tolerant, but nevertheless directly opposed to a definite solution of the Polish Question.This seems to be the consequence of an Imperialistic standpoint perhaps lacking actuality-and of an unwillingness to lose an asset in the political game pursued bv the Progressists. * &amp;      1 J[373-1] E
I take the liberty to enclose my speech to the Italian delegates as a symptom of the need we feel to formulate our standpoint towards the European States in our present Russian surroundings.Moscow, January 29/February 11, 1917.Enclosure 2.M. BRATIANO came to see me yesterday evening in order to express certain views as to the future relations of Great Britain and Roumania, which he was most anxious should be present to, and borne in mind by, His Majesty&apos;s Government.1. M. Bratiano began by alluding to the great hold which, until the war, Germany had over his country. He said that it could not be denied that the enormous progress made of recent years by Roumania was entirely due to German capital and German work; that, without outside help of a similar nature, Roumania would scarcely recover from the war, and will certainly not continue to advance as she had been doing until the present time; and his great desire was that, after the war, Great Britain should take the place of Germany. He did not say so, but what he evidently feared was that, unless British capital and British enterprise were ready to step in as soon as peace was declared, Germany would in a very short time regain her old predominant economic, and therewith political, position.2. M. Pokrovski had shown to M. Bratiano the arrangement between the Allies and Russia in regard to the Dardanelles. M. Bratiano was a little embarrassed as to how he should deal with this communication. He had not asked for it, and M. Pokrovski had given it to him spontaneously as a result of some indifferent enquiry on a cognate matter made by M. Bratiano. The latter feared that if he took no action, and made no reservations on the subject, he might be held to have committed the Roumanian Government to a tacit acceptance of whatever conditions Russia might impose in regard to the navigation of the Dardanelles, within such limits as were somewhat loosely defined in the document that had been given to him. On the other hand, he felt rather powerless and more than a little reluctant, to attack Russia on this point single-handed at the present moment. He asked me to give him my advice as a private individual. I said that it was really rather difficult for me to do so. I believed that it was Cardinal Retz who had declared that the mark of a statesman was to be able to choose between two inconvenient courses of action, and it seemed to me &apos;that either course had its inconveniences for Roumania, but I was scarcely qualified to give an opinion of any authority as to which course the Prime Minister of Roumania should take. I could only suggest that it would be difficult for. the Russian Government to argue that a copy of a document given in this manner and accepted by M. Bratiano constituted a formal recognition by the Roumanian Government of the Russian position. M. Bratiano agreed that it was difficult for me to give him any authoritative advice, but he said that he had noticed in the Constantinople Agreement that His Majesty&apos;s Government had left their desiderata very vague and subject to future definition. He had no doubt that those desiderata would of necessity include a definite and satisfactory agreement as to the navigation of the Danube, inasmuch as the major part of the Danube-borne commerce was carried in British ships. He therefore begged that when this particular point came to be discussed among the Great Powers, Roumania should have a voice before any decision was arrived at He thought that he was entitled to ask for this, since it was really a matter of life and death for the future of his country.3. M. Bratiano desired that particular attention should be paid to the present financial position of the Roumanian Government. - The loan of 40 millions granted to them on their entry into the war was now being drawn upon, but the Roumanian Government had no resources of their own ; they, had been driven from their country; and therefore it was inevitable that this 40 millions, which in normal circumstances would have enabled them to bear more or less the added burden of the war, would now be quite insufficient. He was therefore obliged to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that he would have to make further demands upon the Allies for funds in order to keep Roumania in being.4. M. Bratiano was most anxious that Great Britain should remain a member of the Danube Commission. She had the largest interest in Danube shipping, and her presence there would be an additional safeguard against any attempt on the part of Russia to choke or squeeze Danube-borne traffic.
5 Lastlv, M..Bratiano stated that it would not be enough if the Allies were to win the war without further assistance from the Roumanian army. Roumania had&quot; suffered a great reverse, and she must recover her standing and prestige in the Balkans, both in order to maintain her position among her rivals and in order to renew and refresh the moral standing of her own people. He would therefore have to make serious demands on the Allies for more munitions and material of war, and he was particularly anxious that Great Britain should furnish him with a certain number of big guns. He desired this not only for the military advantage of possessing- the guns but for the ^ood effect in every way that such an act would have in Roumania.G. R. C.February 7, 1917.Enclosure 3.(Confidential.)LORD MILNER had a long interview with M. Chelnokoff and Prince Lvoff at Moscow on the 11th February.M. Chelnokoff, owing to his position as Mayor of Moscow, and the active and able manner in which he has fulfilled the duties of the post during the war, is one of the best-known figures in Russia to-day; and the work which Prince Lvoff has done, as President of the All Russia Zemtsvos Union, has made him universally recognised as, perhaps, the ablest organiser whom Russia possesses.The conversation was entirely confidential on both sides, and was marked by-great openness of speech. The essence of it lay in an effort on the part of the two distinguished Russians to impress upon Lord Milner that the present state of things could not possibly continue. They said that maladministration had reached such a pitch that, although in the country itself there was no real dearth of provisions, and abundance of fuel, yet parts of the country were within - measurable distance of starvation. Hitherto the Government had at least provided, though after perpetual delay, the funds which enabled the Zemtsvos and Cities Unions to carry on the work which had proved of such inestimable value to the Russian army during the war. There were, however, signs that the Minister of the Interior, in his blind anxiety to destroy any and every organisation that could be held to contain the germs of a possible liberal political tendency, would try to withhold the necessary funds. - To do so would literally be fatal to*the Russian army, and possibly that fact might yet save the work of the Unions, but they were already meeting with every sort of difficulty and obstruction short of actual refusal to pay the money.Another instance of the complete absence of efficiency lay in the indiscriminate way in which hundreds of thousands of men had been called up from all sorts of useful work for the army, and were now quartered, for instance, in thousands in Moscow without arms, useless, militarily speaking, for the war ; while, at the samet ime, the shortage of labour in Moscow itself was, coupled with the lack of fuel, &amp;c, leading to the closing of factories, and, even where factories were working, there was no labour to transport the material from and to the railways. 17,000,000 men had been called to the colours, without any sort of discrimination, more than half of them, were without arms, and were left hanging about, doing nothing.A. few months ago, one word from the Emperor to his people to show that he appreciated the situation and meant to meet it would have changed all this, and would have united Russia in an enthusiastic effort to carry through the war with every ounce of energy that her people possessed, but to-day the Emperor&apos;s position as Father of his people was shaken to an extent that no Russian would have thought possible. It was not so much that he was disliked or unpopular, as&apos; that the people of Russia had grown completely indifferent to the person of their Emperor. It was typical of this feeling that now it was quite a common thing for the peasants to leave the churches when the prayers for the Emperor were being uttered.Unless something was done to remedy the present state of things, Prince Lvoff feared that nothing could avert the revolution that Avas threatening. Every day the position grew more difficult, and every day the disorganisation that wanted putting in order became more pronounced, and the remedv, therefore, required to be more drastically applied. Prince Lvoff himself most earnestly hoped that it might be possible to effect some change for the better, anyhow sufficient to ensure a relatively decent administration during the war, without &quot;a revolution; but with every day his nopes grew, less, and though he did not say so, he gave the impression of feeling uiat the presence of the Allied Mission offered perhaps the last chance of opening
the Emperor&apos;s eyes before it was too late. The only definite suggestion that Prince Lvoff made as to the action that might be taken to this end by the Mission was that the Allies should only grant their further supplies on condition that they were used, or some of them, by organisations in which the Allies had confidence, such as the Unions presided over by himself and M. Chelnokoff respectively.Lord Milner observed that he fully appreciated the appalling internal condition of Russia at the present moment, and the wonderful work which Prince Lvoff and M. Chelnokoff were carrying out in the face of every difficulty, and it was obviously in everybody&apos;s interest that the administration of the country should be in the hands of men of that type. But all that Lord Milner, as a statesman of another country discussing questions connected with the war with the Russian Government, could do, was to say that the Allies, who needed every penny and every ounce of war material for themselves, could not make over large quantities of both those things to Russia unless they were absolutely satisfied that the best possible use would be made of them. There was not enough money, there was not enough material, to go round, and therefore both money and material must only be used where they could and would be employed to the best possible effect. This would at least imply that Russia must to some extent put her house in order, and might give an opening for some dis-cussion as to what the Allies required to satisfy them. Further than that the Allied Mission could not go. They were not here to discuss the internal affairs of Russia, but the conduct of the war, and it was only in so far as the conduct of the war was adversely affected by the internal conditions that the Allied representatives could even indirectly approach a political problem. But Lord Milner made it quite clear that his sympathies were entirely with Prince Lvoff and M. Chelnokoff, that he would take the opportunity of letting the Emperor know of the very favourable impression of their work which he had derived from his visit to Moscow, and he added, he would like to say, though he should not do so, that His Majesty had better make Prince Lvoff Minister of the Interior. Prince Lvoff at once said that he would not be able to take such a post, but he quite understood Lord Milner&apos;s point of view, and said that all that he and M. Chelnokoff either expected or desired was that Lord Milner should have a clear understanding of the actual, position in Russia, and they were now quite satisfied that this was the case.February 1917.o
