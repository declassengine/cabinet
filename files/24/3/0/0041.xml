Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1917.SECRET. G.-136.MEMORANDUM UPON POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE DOMINIONS IN RELATION TO IMPERIAL REPRESENTATIONSDUE attention must be given to the attitude towards Empire matters adopted by the various schools of political thought in the Oversea Dominions when considering if any suggestion for closer co-operation in policy and defence is (a) likely to prove acceptable to the assembled Oversea Delegates at the War Conference; (b) likely to form a basis for future working which may be comparatively free from Oversea parliamentary criticism.1. New Zealand.The Dominion of New Zealand is taken first, as it is thought most convenient to consider each Oversea nation in the order in which we may reasonably expect the best measure of support for any movement towards closer union of the Empire.In the case of this Dominion, the War Conference will benefit by the presence of the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative party (Mr. Massey) and of the Finance Minister and leader of the Liberal party (Sir J. Ward). After occupying the position of Prime Minister and leader of his party for many years, Sir Joseph Ward resigned in 1912, and shortly afterwards Mr. Massey became Prime Minister. In 1915, as the result of a General Election, Mr. Massey could not rely upon a majority in Parliament, but, rather than force an election in time of war, Sir Joseph Ward agreed to form with Mr. Massey a National Ministry, with an equal representation from each side, though he had a very good prospect of being returned again to power.The views of Sir Joseph Ward on future Empire relationship are well known, and he has probably gone further than any Oversea statesman in advocating a full Empire Parliament. This he developed at the 1911 Conference, though it is to be noted that he advocated something rather different to the proposals contained in his resolution.! At the present moment, however, Sir Joseph recognises that in time of war it is not possible to establish a truly Imperial-Parliament, but he considers it essential that this Conference should take effective measures to recognise the claim of the Oversea nations to a definite voice in the foreign policy of the Empire. There is every reason to expect that he would give strong support to any measures that would afford representation to the Oversea Cabinets in the War Cabinet after the present Conference is concluded, though he would wish the representation in Empire Councils to be agreed upon as permanent from the first, and not merely for the duration of the war. It can scarcely be said that Mr. Massey has devoted the same attention to the question of Empire relations, but he has frequently declared his adherence to a policy of establishing a Parliament of the Empire, and, pending that, he supports such measures as will give the Dominions an effective voice in policy4It is to be observed that Colonel Sir James Allen (the New Zealand Minister of Defence, and now acting Prime Minister), who may be said to be the strongest, and, perhaps, the ablest man in Mr. Massey&apos;s party, though by no&apos;means the most popular, has often pronounced upon the necessity of a common authority to control the Empire.^Memorandumibli0grapliy deali&quot;g with tbe sublect of &quot;Imperial Kepresentation &quot; on last page of thisR; i1&quot; ?e1e1^d;,5745, ImPerial Conference of 1911, pp. 86-75.

In short, for the purposes of this memorandum, it may be said that the enthusiastically loyal Dominion of New Zealand will support almost any measure that will make for the closer union of the Empire, due regard, of course, being had to the preservation of local autonomy.2. Newfoundland.The attitude of the oldest self-governing community is best given in the words of its Premier (Sir Edward Morris), as follows : &quot; The citizens of the Empire have no longer any doubt that whatever the future may evolve as to closer imperial unity, whether it be representation at Westminster or an Imperial Council, there must be a common army, a common navy, and a common defence for the whole Empire, one efficient and effective to meet all possible combinations and assaults from without.&quot; *3. Australian Commonwealth.The prospect of the Australian Government being able to agree to any practical measures of Imperial Representation has been somewhat marred for the moment by the political complications arising from the Referendum Campaign on the Conscription issue.f Mr. Hughes announced his adherence to the policy of Conscription mainly by I reason of the necessity of Australia meeting the demands of the Army Council at home I for more men.J It is unnecessary to enter into the &quot;pros&quot; and &quot; cons&quot; of the method jby which Mr. Hughes conducted his Conscription Campaign; it is sufficient here to &quot;say that the bulk of the Labour party in the Lower House forsook him and elected Mr. Tudor (who had resigned from his position as Minister for Trade and Customs in Mr. Hughes&apos;s Administration) as their official leader. After the Conscription Referendum had gone against him, Mr. Hughes had only some twelve supporters out of about forty Labour representatives in the Lower House, but he remained in office through the support of Mr. Cook, the leader of the Liberal party, with whom he has lately combined in the formation of a National War Government.As to the supporters of Mr. Tudor, there are many who have said very violent things during the Conscription campaign both against the Empire and most other institutions. To endeavour to put their attitude in a few words they stand for a living wage for every worker, including soldiers, and they are generally against closer Empire relationship by any formal methods as likely to encroach upon local autonomy, which they regard as sacred,But Mr. Hughes has expressed himself as entirely in favour of closer organic union I] between the Home and Oversea nations, and he will undoubtedly have strong support from several in his present Ministry, and notably from those who should havo accompanied him to England, viz. : Sir John Forrest ^[ (the new Treasurer) who has always held advanced views on Imperial unity, and Sir William Irvine, who was Attorney-General in Mr. Cook&apos;s late Liberal Ministry, and is one of the strongest public men in the Commonwealth.Though Mr. Hughes had with the Liberals a majority in the House of Represen-tatives, he was in a minority of two in the Senate on the formation of the new War Ministry-notwithstanding Liberal support in the Upper House. One of Mr. Tudor&apos;s supporters, however, being absent on account of illness, the retirement of another (Senator Ready), gave Mr. Hughes the opportunity of nominating one of his own adherents (Mr. Earle) to fill the vacancy. He hoped thus to secure a majority in his favour, and be able to prolong the life of the present Parliament without a General Election. Unfortunately, how ever,, charges of corruption were made against him in relation to his efforts to get things through, and two of his supporters in the Senate refused to vote for the continuance of Parliament till the charges had been met;* See speech in House of Representatives reported in ;&apos; Daily News,&quot; St. John&apos;s, September 3, 1914. f Conscription was rejected by a majority of about 60,000 in a poll of some 2,250,000.   See Common-wealth Debates, November 29, 1916, at p. 9240.I See Commonwealth Debates, August 30, 1916, at p. 8402.S The attitude adopted by the Australian Labour representatives during the private discussions last year between Home and Oversea Members of Parliament upon Lord Milner&apos;s paper, &quot; The Constitutional Position,&quot; was illustrative of this. .I For example, see speech before the British Imperial Council of Commerce, London, on March 15, 1916.   (Reported in the &quot; Times,&quot; March 16, 1916.)^ See his Memorandum on an Imperial Navy which he submitted as Australian Minister of Defence to the 1902 Colonial Conference, Cd. 1299, pp. 9-14.
so the expected majority in the Upper House disappeared, with the result that a General Election will be necessary. The Conference will consequently be deprived of the proposed Australian Delegates.Though no doubt Mr. Hughes would incur opposition from many supporters ot Mr Tudor if he agreed to any radical changes in the Constitution of the Empire, there is every reason to suppose that he would be prepared to^ accept such reasonable changes as ensured to Australia a more effective voice in Imperial policy.If Mr. Andrew Fisher (the High Commissioner) is asked to represent Australia m any way at the War Conference, he will only be able to act upon instructions from Oversea. He is, however, himself in favour of close consultation with &quot; representatives on the spot directly responsible to the Governments of the Dominions.&quot;*4. Canada.Sir Robert Borden is a strong supporter of the more adequate representation of the Oversea self-governing communities in the Councils of the Empire. It will be remein-bered that at the 1911 Conference Mr. Asquith stated, in reply to Sir Joseph Ward&apos;s proposals, that the responsibility for foreign affairs &quot; cannot be shared.&quot; Upon this Sir Robert Borden subsequently declared &quot;It has been declared in the past, and even during recent years, that the responsibility for foreign policy could not be shared by Great Britain with the Dominions. In my humble opinion adherence to such a position could have but one, and that a most disastrous, result.&quot;tAt many other times Sir Robert Borden has pronounced in favour of the admission, on terms of equality, of the Oversea nations to Imperial Councils. -When referring to the number of troops provided by the Oversea Dominions he spoke of the results obtained in this connection as marking &quot; a great epoch in the history of inter-Imperial relations,1&apos; and he added these pregnant words: &quot;It is impossible to believe that the existing status so far as concerns the control.of foreign policy and extra Imperial relations can remain as it is to-day.&quot; JAgain, the Canadian Minister of Justice (Hon. C. Doherty) recently declared : &quot; We have passed from the status of the protected colony to that of the participating nation. The protected colony was rightly voiceless ; the participating nation cannot continue so.&quot;It is, of course, well known that Sir Wilfrid Laurier (Leader of the Opposition) used the famous phrase many years ago &quot; If you want our aid call us to your counc ils&quot; but it cannot be said that he has supported hitherto any proposal that is likely to lead towards closer Imperial unity.^On the other hand, the more advanced French-Canadian Nationalists have not failed to detect the entirely illogical nature of the present position, when a Ministry responsible solely to the electors of the United Kingdom may involve the whole Empire in war. Their leader, Mr. Henri Bourassa, some years ago attacked any policy which would &quot; draw them into distant wars, foreign to Canada, so long at least as the self-governing colonies of the Empire shall not enjoy with the Mother country, and upon equal footing, the sovereign power and authority.&quot; HGenerally speaking, however, it may be said that the Liberal party of Canada is not in favour of closer Imperial relationship in any scheme which would involve an Imperial Parliament,^ but as they have not opposed the permanent presence of a Canadian Cabinet Minister in London (as Minister of Oversea Forces and Acting-High Commissioner)  it does not seem likely that they would oppose a more constant* See Imperial Conference 1911, Cd. 5745 at pi 69 See also speech by Mr. Fisher on January 81, 1916. 1912       aPeecn of Sl1&apos; Robert Borden when introducing Bill for increasing Naval Forces on December 5,t Speech before Empire Parliamentary Association, July 13, 1915. to i2r     0PP0ftlon to Defence Measures (1902 Conference) to Secretariat- proposal (1907 Conference), ConfTrSce)!&apos;7 0907 Conference)&apos; to Standing Committee of Conference proposal (1911II Speech on Naval Service Bill, 1910.KMr lnnwl^ffcMUpe Wal Wel1 0lltlined &quot;in a speech at the Parliamentary Conference last year by (ex-LibPral U\Ma&quot;d Jecently* 111 the Canadian House of Commons, by Mr. Eodolphe Lemieux, M.P.

consultation with a Cabinet representative on Foreign Affairs, or any measures that recognised to the full the nationality and independent position of Canada.The position of Sir Robert Borden is a little complicated by his French-Canadian supporters. Some, at any rate, of the three French-Canadian Ministers in his Cabinet (Mr. Blondin,* Postmaster-General; Mr. Patenaude, Secretary of State; and Mr. Sevigny, Minister of Inland Revenue) have undoubtedly committed themselves before taking office to statements of an anti-Imperial character,! but though this may detract, to a certain extent, from the significance of Mr. Sevigny&apos;s recent triumph for the Conservative cause at the Dorchester (Quebec) bye-election   it need not necessarily affect the practical measures towards closer Imperial organisation to which Sir R. Borden would, no doubt, be prepared to commit himself and his English and French supporters.Indeed, throughout his public career, Sir R. Borden has shown a wide and states-manlike grasp of Imperial matters and, provided that any steps recognise the nationhood to which Canada has grown, it may be assumed that they will have his whole-hearted support.5. South Africa.It has to be at once admitted that it is in regard to South Africa that least readiness will be found for any advance towards the closer political union of the Empire. Indeed, this can scarcely be wondered at when the recent history of the sub-Continent is considered and the fact remembered that there is a considerable portion of the Boer population which still yearns for independence. As General Smuts recently stated, there is no doubt from documents and speeches &quot; that the object of the rebellion was independence&quot;^; but though the leader of the Nationalist party (General Hertzog) does not openly declare in favour of an independent South Africa, he would certainly bitterly oppose any scheme of closer union which put the interests of the Empire before those of South Africa, or which did not recognise the nationhood of South Africa. From the constitutional aspect there is no doubt that General Hertzog&apos;s attitude has some logical groundwork. The following extract from one of his speeches does not materially differ from some utterances of advanced French-Canadian Nationalists : &quot; What was the British Empire in truth ? As a body, like the German Empire, there was no such thing as a British Empire ; an empire in the correct sense of the word they had not got. They had England, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other Dominions. They did not stand under England, nor England under them, but they stood under the English King. They stood on an equal footing with the other Dominions, but now people spoke of the six Dominions as the British Empire, though there was no Imperial Parliament and no Imperial Government. They stood alone and each was independent of the other.&quot; IIThe Leader of the Opposition in the Union Parliament (Sir Thomas Smartt) has noted with apprehension the tendency of General Botha since the last General Election to &quot; play up &quot; to the growing power of the Nationalists,^ and unquestionably it would be to the liking of some Dutch members of the present Ministry (notably Sir Jacobus de Graaff) if a combination could be formed with the Nationalists. . Though the personal question between Generals Botha and Hertzog may prevent this for the present (and the victory of the South African Party at the last bye-election will, perhaps, stiffen General Botha&apos;s attitude towards the Nationalists), there is no doubt that General Botha fears any discussions which may commit him to a scheme for an Imperial Parlia-ment, as this would be at once attacked by the Nationalists as an Imperialist measure, involving the surrender of South African autonomy. Considerable apprehension on the part of the Union Premier was clearly disclosed in the recent confidential telegrams* It is announced (March 21) that Mr. Blondin is enlisting in the Overseas Forces.ff See speech of Mr. Lemieux in House of Commons, January 25, 1917, which also reviews the Nationalist policy of opposition to wars outside Canadian territory.\ It is to be noted, however, that Mr. Sevigny&apos;s attitude throughout the contest was one of support for the Empire; his opponent, Mr. Cannon, asked the electors if they should ruin their country for England, and had his candidature officially supported by Sir W. Laurier.S See speech in House of Assembly, March 3, 1915.B Speech at Cradock, October 4, 1915.f The Nationalist party before the election of October 1915 consisted, in the House of Assembly, of &quot;about twelve members. As the result of the election the strength rose to 27, the supporters of General Botha numbering 54, the Unionists 40, Labour 4, and Independents 5.
from the Governor-General of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, when he indicated that the South African Government had not understood that the political relations of the Empire were to be discussed at the coming Conference, as this would be inconvenient in the absence of General Botha himself from the Conference. This attitude is not difficult to understand, as in a recent bye-election General Botha was violently attacked by the Nationalists for being, as they alleged, in favour of South Africa giving up her rights to create an Imperial Federal Parliament.General Botha denied this &quot; most emphatically,&quot; and claimed that he had proved most clearlv at the Imperial Conference that he was not in favour of an Imperial Federal Parliament.* But though a Federal Parliament may not be acceptable to the South African Ministry, it is to be noted that the object of &quot; giving the various parts of the Empire a final say in questions of great importance such as tbe declaration of war &quot; has been commended by Mr. Burton (Minister of Railways) as an honest one ;f while Mr. F. S. Malan (Minister of Mines, Industries, and Education) has made a far more significant declaration, indicating possibly some agreement in the Ministry for accepting a share in the direction of Empire policy, in the following words : &quot; If a Council were to be formed only to discuss the questions of peace and war, the Dominions would gain, for then they would have a voice in the question of war, whereas now, if Great Britain declared war, the Dominions were at war as part of the Empire, although they had no voice in declaring war.&quot;JThus it cannot be said that the South African Government, even with due regard to the Nationalist attitude upon the logical incompleteness of the present Empire relations, would be necessarily, or indeed probably, opposed to accepting a larger share in Empire Councils provided that due regard were paid to the equality of South Africa&apos;s national status and the avoidance of any encroachment upon autonomous rights.Even though General Smuts may plead at the coming Conference that he has no mandate to agree to anything respecting political relations, there is little reason to believe he would refuse to telegraph for his Government^ approval if the suggestions made at the Conference for closer Imperial consultation should be based on the necessity of more intimate co-operation for war purposes. Indeed, if the proposals clearly extended a right to South Africa which she has hitherto been denied, and, moreover, had no relation to the autonomous powers of the Union Parliament, General Smuts might possibly commend them. In the light of General Botha&apos;s attitude at the 1911 Conference on the necessity of consulting the Dominions^ when the British Government deals with matters affecting them, it is possible that he might not be opposed to such methods of closer consultation as would be involved, for example, in sending a Dominion Cabinet representative to reside in London during the period of the war for the purposes of consultation by the War Cabinet when necessity arose.Rnrt,*&apos; S^.fPjech at Ermelo (bye-election), reported &quot; Weekly Cape Times,&quot; November 3,1916.
