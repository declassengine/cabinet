SECRET.Conference of the Allies in Petrograd, January-February 1917.PART I. GENERAL NOTE.THE Munitions Sub-Commission was entirely occupied with an examination of the needs of Russia not only in artillery and other munitions, but also in raw materials, machinery, and commercial products. All these various demands had been prepared in considerable detail before the arrival of the Mission, and, in particular, great care had been spent in drawing up for the first time a carefully thought-out scheme of artillery equipment.A summary of these detailed demands, together with various comments and recommendations, was presented before the sittings were concluded in a report to Lord Milner by the British representatives on the Sub-Commission isee Part 111 below), while the conclusions were embodied in consultation with the French and Italian delegates in a separate statement which was presented to the Minister of War (see Part II below).This document was accepted by him as the report of the Munitions Sub-Commission subject to the reservation that small changes should if necessary be made in the allotment of available transport facilities.Tonnage.The demands put forward amounted with existing orders to some 13 million tons of material, but though very little of this could be ruled out as unnecessary, it was clear that this quantity of goods could not possibly be imported into Russia in 1917.It was not easy with the information at our disposal to determine what exactly were the limiting factors to the capacity for importation. Official figures were put forward showing that the ports could deal with 12-f million tons in .1.917, while the railways, it was said, could handle 8 million tons. The figures would not, however, stand examination, and at a special conference the port capacity was reduced to 1,131,1 00 tons. Even this figure wars considered by both the British and Erench officers to be excessive, and as it seemed impossible to arrive at definite limits either for the ports or railways, the shipping tonnage arrangements for the year, as given by the Admiralty, viz., 3,400,000 tons, were taken as our basis. This figure will severely tax the resources of the ports, and will require some very important improvements in organisation. In view of the possibilities of delays in delivery and losses, it seemed, however, desirable to allow a margin 25 per cent, above this figure in the supply arrangements for 1917. The programme was therefore based on the figure of 4  million tons for the calendar year.Artillery, &amp;c.Of this amount 1,200,000 tons were allocated to artillery. This is far greater tnan the amount of these munitions hitherto imported, but it represents little more than one quarter of the demands. /The total is largely composed of 3-inch shell, rifles, o.A.A., aeroplanes and explosives already on order, together with cessions of heavy artillery and^ ammunition already promised. But these supplies would have left the artillery equipment very far from adequate, and it was therefore proposed that Great Britain should allocate to Russia four batteries of 6-inch, two batteries of 8-inch, and one battery of 9 2-inch howitzers per. month for six months starting from June next. JNo more guns than those previously ceded could possibly be sent into R/ussia until Archangel opens, and the offer will leave the whole British output of April and May for our own forces.[370-].] B
The proposal was put forward on a monthly basis, as a regular supply of artillery will greatly facilitate the work of training, &amp;c. The Minister of War was very anxious that Great Britain should take full responsibility for shipping and delivering these batteries complete with all equipment in Russia, just as it would if placing them on the Western front. Russia is herself turning out five 0-inch howitzer batteries a month, and with the cession proposed will be able to put into the field in the last half of 1917 nine 6-inch and three heavier howitzer batteries a month. It is thought that this ratio of three to one represents a suitable ratio of 6-inch to heavier artillery. Ammunition for these guns must be supplied from home, for the production of Russian type ammunition is still inadequate for the guns in the field and is limited by the output of shell steel. There is no prospect of Russia&apos;s shell capacity increasing sufficiently to leave a margin for making British type ammunition. Neither France nor ourselves were able to offer help in the matter of field guns, though the require-ments for the equipment of new divisions, for increasing the establishment per division (54 instead of 30 per division are aimed at) and for making good wastage are greatly in excess of Russia&apos;s own output. As regards aeroplanes, the needs of Russia are at least as important as in the case of artillery, and though no precise numbers were given, Russia was told that the utmost possible number of aeroplanes would be sent up to a total of 800 machines complete with machine guns and wireless apparatus. These wilt be sent to Major Valentine, and the training of pilots for these machines will be under his control. The Grand Duke Alexander has also arranged to send regularly a certain number of men and officers both to France and England to study British methods and machinery. Further, the Grand Duke was informed that the British Government hoped to be able to send one or twro squadrons of fighting aeroplanes with personnel and equipment, to sweep the front before the Russian offensive starts. The Russians were also offered fifty Stokes and fifty 2-inch-trench mortars with ammunition for experimental and demonstration purposes, in addition to the heavy mortars already being supplied.Offers were also made with regard to propellant and explosives. In the former case, emphasis was laid on the danger of Russia&apos;s growdng dependence on America, which is even greater than in our own case. There is unfortunately nothing that can be done to modify the situation materially this year, and we must therefore undertake to provide sufficient imports to enable Russia to complete her full ammunition programme. The figures are subject to small modifications as a result of the decisions of the Conference, but it is essential that arrangements should be made now to send forward an adequate supply as soon as Archangel opens. If this is done, Russia can afford to run the risk of using up all her reserves during the intervening months. It is also important that the supplies should be as evenly spread as possible in order to prevent unduly large accumulations at Archangel.Other Artillery Department demands, together with the answers given by the British delegates,, are enumerated in a statement given below.Other Requirements,The next demand in order of urgency is for railway material. But there are already 700,000 tons on order for delivery this year, and it is extremely improbable that orders could be placed for additional quantities, or, if placed, could be transported this year. The need is, however, so urgent that it was agreed to recommend that orders should be placed now for delivery at the end of 1917 of 200,000 tons of rails and 100,000 tons of rolling-stock.Special importance was also attached to the demand for barbed wire. It is true there are 00,000 tons awaiting shipment at A7ladivostock, but when this is moved it will not go very far to. meet requirements. Most of the front is very inadequately barbed, and on the southern front it is almost entirely lacking. The demands will also be exceedingly heavy if there is any appreciable movement of the line during the present summer. Russia is: herself making barbed wire,, but has a capacity for barbing still larger quantities. It was therefore decided to recommend, that orders- should be placed for sufficient wire to keep her factories employed.These two items-railway material and wire-together with 1,200,000 tons for the Artillery Department,, and 1,500,000 tons which was agreed as the minimum coal requirement, amount to 3,510,000, leaving only 740,000 tons for other demands.Of this it is proposed to allocate 280,000 tons to metals, including 100,000 tons of shell steel and 200,000. tons to motor transport.   This latter figure will involve scaling
down existing orders and allocating tonnage as between France, Italy, and Great Britain. The Minister of War should be pressed to confirm or modify this total and to make an allocation at the earliest possible moment. Roumania is to have 120,000 tons of the balance, leaving 140,000 tons for marine demands, army equipment, and&apos;all commercial requirements. A comparison of this figure with the demands given in the detailed report below, shows that, by agreeing in principle to this tonnage programme, the Russian Government are prepared to face the acutest shortage in commercial materials, cotton, rubber, wool, &amp;c, and to cut off almost entirely the importation of machinery for the sake of getting large additional quantities of artillery and coal into the country. Russia&apos;s needs are, in fact, extremely acute, and all possible steps should bo taken to secure that the proposed total of 3,400,000 tons is supplied, and, if possible, exceeded.Capacity of the Ports.It is, of course, useless to send goods which can neither be unloaded nor moved away by rail. But the work done at Archangel in 191G was far better than was expected-the port being practically cleared by Christmas--and with last year&apos;s experience it should be possible to make a further very appreciable increase in 1917. The capacity of the Vladivostock route is limited by the railway, but it is not impossible that means may be found for increasing the capacity of the Siberian line. This is a matter to which Mr. Hary is giving special attention, while it has also been suggested that the Japanese could render some help in providing rolling-stock, and possibly also in developing the route through Dalny.There remains the question of the Murrnan Railway, which is one of immediate and pressing importance, in view of the fact that every ton of material which is to reach the front by midsummer must pass into Russia by this route. The railway will also be of special importance next winter for the regular provisioning with ammunition of the British type artillery which will then be in the field. When the Mission reached Romanov only one munition train, containing 120 tons of goods, had passed over the line, though there&apos; were then 20,000 tons afloat awaiting discharge. No reliable information was received from Romanov during our stay in Petrograd; but on Monday, the 19th February (n.s.), Led Milner presided at a meeting at which were present various representatives of the Railway Department, including representa-tives of the Construction and Traffic Departments, as well as representatives of the Admiralty and of the Ministry of Commerce, which controls the ports.These gentlemen were agreed that we could safely rely on the transport of 120,000 tons before the line becomes impassable in May, and this total, if realised, would permit of the despatch of most of the urgent material, which should be on the front by the summer. It was urged that this estimate was a conservative one, and it was pointed out that the railway had only just been taken over from the Construction Department by the regular Traffic Department.These anticipations were, however, not confirmed by the result of enquiries at Romanov itself on our return. The cargo afloat had risen to 44,000 tons, of which it was hoped to send 12,000 round to Archangel by icebreaker, while 24,000 tons more were expected. The tonnage forwarded by rail by the 7th February (o.s.) had reached 5,180 tons, and was leaving at the rate of 200 tons a day, Le., one train a day as against five a clay required to complete the February programme. The discharging berths are capable of dealing with 1,500 tons a day, but both warehouse accommodation and shore labour are inadequate, with the result that trucks which are needed to move material along the piers are being used as storing places in the rear of the port. Hence the unloading gangs were standing idle waiting for trucks. There is only warehouse capacity lor some 5,000 tons, and this is largely being used for stores in connection with the naval base. There are, in short, a number&quot;of serious troubles which are preventing the clearing of the port. But the difficulties are all such as are capable of being overcome by energetic handling. The work of the next four weeks will show whether there is any prospect of getting through any considerable volume of material by May. *      &amp;        &amp;In this connection the Minister of War has agreed to reserve the railway exclusively for certain artillery requirements, and orders have been issued to ship no other goods either from New York or from London. Our journeys over the railway were very satisfactory, and,.wdien certain weak places have been strengthened, curves ana gradients reduced, and passing places increased this summer, the line should enable us to pour into Russia a continuous stream of ammunition and other munitions during the winter of 1917-18L370-1] .   \ B2
Archangel remains, however, the most important means of access to Russia, and at that port the chief difficulty is labour, which is not sufficiently controlled or of good enough quality. The Mission therefore pressed upon the attention of the Government a scheme for the militarisation of shore labour handling general cargo. This scheme, which was drawn up by Commodore Kemp and discussed by the officers of the Mission with British officials haviug a knowledge of conditions in the White Sea, was approved by the Minister of Marine and the Minister of War. On the day we left Petrograd the proposal was submitted by Admiral Korvin (the Russian admiral in charge of Archangel) to General Gourko, who will have to find the men and officers, but we are unable to say whether his concurrence was obtained. The matter has been left, so far as British interests are concerned, in the hands of a Committee consisting of General Poole, Commodore Kemp, and Mr. Lindley.On the whole, if things go well, there is a prospect that the ports may be able to deal with more than 3,400,000 tons this year, and it is extremely desirable that, if there is evidence of this happening, the Admiralty should make every effort to feed Russia to the full capacity of the ports, on the one condition that a definite tonnage programme and priority arrangement is finally approved and strictly adhered to by the Russian Government, It is worth a great deal of sacrifice to get the vital necessities into Russia, but not to import material of secondary importance.In this connection, the most important statement was made by the Minister of War that he has now insisted in the Council of Ministers that all orders to be placed overseas must be approved by him, and that as soon as he has had time to study outstanding orders he will issue an authoritative order of priority.Russian Output.The conclusions of the Commission pointed time and again to the vital necessity of securing an improvement in the output of Russia&apos;s mines, furnaces, and workshops. To a large extent this is a matter of transport, on which Mr. Bury will report later ; but definite recommendations were made with regard to the recall of skilled labour frcm the colours and to the appointment of an organiser for the Donetz coal area. It is also clearly desirable that latest ideas from the Western Powers should be available iii Russia, and the War Department welcomed an exchange of experts. In particular we have undertaken to send out to Rus*sia one or more representatives, who will be able to explain what has been done in England in the way of economising the use of metals. The Artillery Department is also sending to England an officer to study our methods of amatol filling and the composition of signal lights.It may be remarked here that much good work of this kind has already been done by French experts in Russia, but even more important results of the work of French permanent Mission are indicated in the-rapid increase in output in the Moscow area .which has been organised by them. Half the total Russian output of 3 inch ammunition is now filled in a factory erected and run by these French officers. It is important that British munitions officers in Russia should wrork in closest touch with this Mission, and above1 all that there may be no divergence in the advice which is pressed upon the Minister of War.Shipping and British Representation in Russia.Reference has already been made to the request of the Minister of War that the British Government should make itself responsible for the despatch to Russia of all British type war material - which should be sent complete with all necessary appurtenances to a British officer in Russia, who would be responsible for handing it over to the authorities in a form in which it could quickly be made ready for service. It was pointed out that this would involve a duplication of shipping authorities in England, as the Russian Commission would still be responsible for shipping raw materials and other goods. The Minister of War was of opinion that if the British Government wished to take over all shipments, no objection would be raised in Russia if this were done. The duties of the Russian Commission would be limited to dealing with contracts and to acting as the channel through which the Russian Government make known its wishes as regards priority, whether in production or in shipping.This suggestion is intimately connected with the proposals for British repre-sentation in Russia. The Minister of War heartily welcomed the suggestion that the British Minister of Munitions should have an officer in Petrograd who would combine with other duties that of a liaison officer between the Ministry of War and the Ministry
of Munitions. His organisation should be such as to enahle him to advise the British Government on the munition situation in Russia, while he would also be an adviser to the Russian Minister of War.The precise functions of this officer and his relations to General Poole and to the various Departments at home are matters which will require speedy consideration. In this connection, however, it appears that some steps may be required to centralise at home the work of the War Office, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, Treasury, and Commission internationale de Ravitaillement, in dealing with Russian affairs, have, for example, brought back a very considerable number of documents dealing with various aspects of the munitions problem in Russia ; but although all the work of the Mission emphasises the need of dealing with this problem and especially the allocation of transport as a whole, there is no one British Department to whom the information should be handed over.o

(Voir plus loiu article 14.)l370 -2JespererConclusions of the Representatives of the Allies on the Armaments Commission.1. THE representatives of the Allies on the Armaments Commission have examined with the most sympathetic attention the demands put forward by the Russian Government, which they consider to be needed in their entirety.2. It is, however, necessary to take into account, not merely the restricted capacity of the few ports through which all imports must be brought, and the insufficiency of the means of rail transport from these distant bases to the interior of the country, but also the limited quantity of shipping tonnage which the representatives of Great Britain have indicated will be available. On the whole, it is very improbable that it will be possible to import into Russia during the current calendar year more than 3,400,000 tons,* although every effort will be made to exceed this figure. Moreover, in view of the increased dangers of navigation, it is quite possible that even this figure may not be reached.In accordance with .an arrangement already existing, 120,000 tons out of the total available must be reserved for Roumanian munitions.3. It is, however, necessary that all supply arrangements should be based on the most favourable hypothesis, and steps taken to send-to Russia the maximum possible total. Some excess allowance may even suitably be made for losses and delays in delivery.4. In view of these conditions, it is sug-gested, for the consideration of the Russian Government, that the following allocations should be made among the various classes* Not including the additional imports which it is hoped will be supplied from Japan.B

Toutefois, on pense que 200,000 tonnes pourraient etre reservees aux auto-mobiles de toute nature.II conviendrait alors d etablir une repar-tition de ces 200,000 tonnes entre les trois pays, France, Grande-Bretange et Italie, et de limiter les expeditions de cbaque pays, en 1917, a la part qui lui aurait ete attribute.II resterait ensuite 140,000 tonnes dis-ponibles pour les autres besoi-ns. Ce total est inferieur au tonnage necessaire pour le transport des commandes cleja en -cours. II sera probablement insuffisant pour la quantite des marchandises qui attendront fembarquement dans les ports et entrepots(e.) Propellant:30,000 tons in all for the year 1917, including orders already placed.Italy.200 105 millim. guns, delivery to start in March 1917. 40 anti-aircraft guns for the navy. (The cession of GO more, as well as of cartridge cases and fuses, is still under consideration by the Italian Government.)Other demands are also under considera-tion by tbe Italian Government.6. The tonnage uiven under the head of &quot;Railway Material&quot; represents the amount to be delivered on existing orders, including 370,000 tons of rails.In view, however, of the urgent need of increasing the means of transport, the English delegates will recommend their Government to place, if possible, addi-tioual orders, up to a total of 100,000 tons of rolling-stock, and 200,000 tons of rails for delivery in the last quarter of 1917, and for transport to Russia at the beginning of 1918.7. The English delegates will also re-commend their Government to cede to Russia out of its own resources 4,000 tons of shel] steel a week during the six months open navigation at Archangel, on condition that the Russian Artillery Department will produce before June a design of shell for use in Russian type guns for which British quality shell steel would be suit-able.Further, in view of tbe urgent require-ments on (he Russian front, they will recommend that 110,000 tons of wire shall be ordered in America to be transformed in Russia into barbed wire.8. The most suitable distribution of the remaining tonnage is a matter for the consideration of the Russian Government. It is, however, suggested that a figure of (say) 200,000 tons should be reserved for motor vehicles of all classesFurther, a division of these 200,000 tons should be made between the three countries, France, Great Britain, and Italy, and shipments from each country during 1917, should be strictly limited to the tonnage allocated to it.If these suggestions are accepted, there would remain 140,000 tons available for all other needs this total is considerably less than the tonnage required to trans-port the goods due on existing orders, and will probably be less than the volume of material which will actually be waiting
lors de la reouverture de la navigation. 11 n*est done pas opportun de lancer de nouvelles comraandes a, livrer dans Pannee courante.Toutefois, en raison de 1&apos;interet tout special qu&apos;il y a a faciliter les transports dans 1&apos;interieur du pays et sur le front, les delegu^s de la Grande-Bretagne propose-ront a leur Gouvernement de placer des commandes pour la livraison immediate de orues et autres outillages pour le port d&apos;Arkhangelsk et aussi de harnachement.Les representants allies croient devoir appeler 1&apos;attention du Gouvernement russe sur le danger de l&apos;encombrement qui se produirait, dans les ports de depart, si des mesures netaient pas prises pour differer 1&apos;envoi dans ces ports des marchandises qui ne sont pas de premiere urgencef9. Pour que le materiel cede puisse etre mis dans le plus bref delai possible a, la disposition des armees russes, on estime qu&apos;il serait necessaire de reserver le chemin de fer Mourman, jusqu&apos;a la reouverture du port d&apos;Arkangelsk, ou transport du materiel d&apos;artillerie, des mortiers de tranchee, des munitions, des poudres et du materiel rf aviation.II est prudent de prevoir le cas ou le traflc serait interrompu sur une partie de la ligne par suite d&apos;un accident quelconque, et dassurer dans ce cas le transport par traineau dans cette partie. II convient done de rassembler a 1&apos;avance, pour les avoir sous la main en cas de besoin, des tralneaux, animaux et conducteurs neces-saires.II est d&apos;aulre part indispensable de prendre toutes les precautions utiles pour garantir la securite du port de Eomanoff et de ses abords, tant contre les accidents a. terre que contre les enti eprises des sous-marins ou autres navires ennemis.Enfin, pour eviu-r toute perte de temps, d y aurait iuteret a ce que les droits de douane soient peryus non a Romanoff, mais dans une viile de rinterieur.10. II y a lieu de remarquer que le programme propose ne pourra etre execute que si des mesures energiqnes sont prises sans delai pour assurer dans les meilleures conditions le foncuonnement du port dArkhangelsk, qui est actuellement la prmcipale porte d&apos;entree sur la Russie. i A ce propos, on considere comme tout a fait indispensable de militarises, avant la reouverture de la navigation, le personnel du port charge des manutentiens a terre et du chargement des trains.11. Le tonnage maximum preVu ne pourra etre realise que si les navires sont retenus le moins longtcmps possible dans [370-2]shipment at the ports, or in warehouses when navigation opens; it is, therefore, clearly undesirable that any new orders should be placed for delivery during the current year.In view, however, of the special import-ance of facilitating transport both into Russia and on the Eastern front, the British delegates will recommend their Government to place orders for immediate delivery of cranes and other equipment needed in the port of Archangel, and also for harness.The allied representatives desire to call the attention of the Russian Government to the danger of congestion which will be produced at the ports of embarcation unless measures are taken to prevent the despatch to the ports of goods ot secondary importance.9. In order that the monitions ceded to Russia may be put at the disposal of the armies with the least possible delay, it is considered essential that until the opening of Arcbaneel the Murman Railway shah be entirely reserved for the transport of guns and howitzers, trench mortars, ammu-nition, propellaut, and aviation material.In view of the possibility that traffic may be interrupted by an accident on some part of the line it is desirable to make provision for sledge transport. For this purpose an adequate suppty of sledges, animals and drivers, ,-hould be immediately mobilised, so as to be ready in case of emergencv.It is further essential to take all possible precautions to guarantee the saft-ty of the port of Romanoff and its environment, both against accidents on land and against attacks from submarine and other enemy vessels.Finally, to prevent congestion and less of time at the port, it is suggested that the customs should be levied, not at Romanoff itself, but at some town in the interior.10. It is to be observed that the pro-gramme proposed can only be carried out if energetic measures are taken without delay to assure that suitable conditions of work prevail at the port of Archangel, which is actually the chief gateway into Prussia.For this purpose it is considered abso-lutety essential that, before the opening of navigation, the. shore labour handling general cargo should be put under a military regime.11. The maximum shipping tonnage indicated can only be supplied if ships are retained for the minimum possible
les porfs. A ce point de vue, une nouvelle difficulty surgira, en 1917, a Arkhangelsk, en raison de la necessite d&apos;exporter au moins 500,000 tonnes de ble\II est dene de la plus haute importance de preparer energiquement et sans retard cette derniere operation, en commencant des maintenant la construction des quais, magasins, &amp;c.12. A cause de rimpossibilite d&apos;importer tout le charbon et lacier qui font defaut a la Russie, il est essentiel que sa production propre soit augmentee, en 1917, par tous les moyens possibles. Dapres les ren-seignements recueillis, on est davis q,ue les grandes mines pourraient produire plus de charbon si Ton mettait a leur disposition le personnel specialiste necessatre qu&apos;il faudrait rappder du front a cet effet. On obtiendrait uue amelioration immediate de la situation en coneentrant dans la main d un seul chef, energique et actif, ia re-partition de^ charbons dans la region du Sud, et la distribution des wagons pour leur transport.13. La penurie des metaux oblige aussi a en supprimer 1&apos;emploi dans les industries quin&apos;ont aucun rapport avec la guerre. De meme, dans la fabrication du materiel de guerre et des munitions, il est indis-pensable oVuser de tous les procedes propres a economiser le metal.14. II semble que les ressources du Japon, cn ce qui emcerne les munitions, n&apos;aient pas ete utilisees aussi largement qu&apos;il eut ete possible.- On suggere que les Gouvemements allies representes a la Con-ference fassent une demarche aupres du Gouvernement japonais pour lui demander d&apos;organLer ses ressources en vue de fuurnir a la Hussie poudres, acier, cuivre, materiel de chemiu de fer et munitions coufec-tionneVs.Si le Gouvernement japonais se chargeait de 1&apos;organisation des transports par mer et de la fourniture de wagons et de locomo-tives, il en resulterait un supplement de materiel appreciable.15. Si le Gouvernement russe pensait que la mise a sa disposition dhngenieurs ou autres experts put favoriser le develop -pement de sa production, ses Allies de 1&apos;Ouest seraient heureux de lui donner satisfaction sur ce point.16. Les representants allies tiennent a exprimer leur reconnaissance pour le tres obligeant empressement avec lequel le Gouverneinent russe leur a fourni tous les renseignements demandes.length of time at the port; in this con-nection a new difficulty will arise, in 1917, at Archangel, from the necessity of export-in^ at least 500,000 tons of wheat.It is, therefore, of the first importance that prompt and energetic steps shall be taken for facilitating this operation, and that the nece-sary berths, warehouses, &amp;c , should be immediately taken in hand.12. In view of the impossibility of im-porting all the coal and steel which Russia requires, it is essential that her own pro-duction should be increased, in 1(J17, by all possible means. From information received, it is thought that more coal could be pro-duced from the mines if they could obtain further skilled labour, which would have to be recalled from the Army for the purpose. An immediate improvement in the situation would also be obtained by the appointment of an energetic aud active officer, who would have supreme control of the distri-bution of coal in the region of the South, and of the allocation of waggons for its tra- sport.13. The scarcitv of metals makes it necessary to suppress their use in indus-tries that have no direct connection with the war. On the other hand, it is also essential to introduce all possible devices for economising metal in the manufacture of guns, ammunition, and other war material.14. It appears that the munition pro-ducing resources ot Japan have not hitherto been utilised to the fudest possible extent. Ic is recommended that the Allied Govern-ments represented at the Conference should put before the Japanese Govern-ment the necessity of organising its resources in order to provide Russia with propellant, steel, copper, railway material, and completed munitions.If the Japanese Government would undertake the organisation of transport by sea, and could find means of supplying a certain number of waggons and loco-motives, it might be possible to make a considerable addition to the quantity of munitions that could be imported into Russia as indicated above.15. If the Russian Government is of opinion that the development of its output could be increased by engineering or other expert assistance, the Western Allies would be glad to aid them in this respect.16. The Allied delegates wish to express their appreciation of the readiness which has been shown by the Russian Government in supplying them wdth all necessary information.

SUB-COMMISSION ON MUNITIONS.REPORT TO LORD MILNER BY THE BRITISH MEMBERS.1. Conferences have been held under the Chairmanship of the Minister of War, and subsequently at various Ministries, at which comprehensive demands have been put forward showing the Russian requirements of all kinds of goods for war purposes.The Minister of War was not willing to consider the question of tonnage or finance, or any other consideration which might limit supplies, except the possibility or otherwise of production, until the whole demands had been put forward and the reasons for each specified in more or less detail.2. The following report deals with the chief items. in these demands together with such suggestions as we are able to make with the information available, as to the desirability as well as the possibility of meeting them. Generally, suggestions are also made as to the reduction of these demands within the limits of the capacity of importation.CHAPTER I. ARTILLERY. Section A. Guns.3. At the first meeting of the Committee the Minister of War proposed to consider only the possibility of supplying the very extensive requirements detailed in Part IV. of this report, which was communicated to the Committee. In accordance with our instructions, however, a demand was at once made for information as to (a) The present position as regards the artillery equipment of the Russian Army.(6) The programme (number of divisions, establishment, &amp;c.) on which the requirements were based.After some discussion, in which we were supported by the French, this was agreed to, although the preparation of the second statement involved some delay.4. The obtaining of a complete statement (Annex 2) as to the guns, &amp;c. in existence in Russia, authorised by all those responsible, has beena great help. Heretofore, it has never been possible to obtain a comprehensive statement showing the total of all the guns on the front, in reserve, in the arsenals, &amp;c, and the partial statements given at different times by different authorities have been of little value, owing to the possibility of the same material appearing in different categories in different lists. The form now adopted was drawn up on consultation with the French members, with the view of obviating such discrepancies, and the figures have been agreed to by the Minister for War, the Chief of the Artillery Department, and the Grand Duke Serge, Inspector-General of Artillery, representing the Stavka.5. Similarly, no information has hitherto been available as to the Russian views regarding the numbers of guns of the different types which should he provided for an army of any given size, such a programme of requirements, that is to say, as was put forward by the C. in C. of both the British and French forces last year. It is obvious, however, that even if the full realisation of such an ideal is beyond the possibilities of attainment, something of the sort is essential to the proper placing of orders and the allotment of the resources available.The present Position.j 6. Before considering the demands made, it is advisable to examine the present position in Russia, or rather the position in the spring. This can be deduced with sufficient accuracy from the statement supplied as to the present position and our knowledge of what will be available from Russian and other production between now and the end. of March-material which should have reached the front by the time the weather permits of active operations.o   (33)2780(2612)   40   3/17   E &amp; S A 2
The result is shown in the following tables in which the various natures of guns and howitzers are arranged in the categories agreed upon at the Paris Conference: Category.

Taking first the field guns, Category I. The Russian establishment per division is 36, which is low, but, at the same time, as much as that of the Ralian or German armies. AH divisions are, however, not fully equipped even on this scale, and, in view of the method of employment of field artillery, it is not sufficient to consider only the proportion per division. The first duty of field artillery is to check any advance of the enemy&apos;s infantry by its barrage fire. For such a barrage to be effective, however, 100 yards is the longest front which can safely be allotted to one gun, even with a.real quick-firing gun, which the Russian field gun is not. The total number of field guns (including both horse and mountain artillery) is, however, only 7,852, and, taking the front as 1,800 kilometres, this gives only 4 guns per kilometre, without allowing for any guns at all being in reserve. The average front to be covered by each gun will, therefore, be nearly 300 yards instead of 100 yards, just given as the maximum for safety. It is true that we have sometimes stripped our front until guns were covering up to 150 yards, but this has only been done when either (i) the enemy&apos;s power of taking the offensive had been paralyzed by attacks elsewhere ; or (ii) when the risk was deliberately run in order to withdraw divisions for training, and these were, of course, available as reserves. For the purely defensive task of &quot; holding the line,&quot; the Russian field artillery is obviously quite inadequate, according to the standard prevailing on the Western Front. Moreover, the offensive has to be con-sidered. For this, 1 field gun to 15 yards is considered a proper allowance, so that, for an attack on a front of, say, 20 kilometres, some l,200textra guns would be required.A year or so ago there was some talk of the day of field artillery being over, and, in view of a possible tendency in the same direction in Russia, it is important to remember that heavy artillery cannot be considered a substitute for field artillery. As the result of our experience on the Somme, we are now increasing our field artillery beyond our present 48 guns per division, so that we shall soon have 20 per kilometre, while the French will have rather over 12.8. As regards heavy artilleiy, it will be sufficient at present to consider Categories. 11., III., and IV. together ; this gives a total of 4,094 guns and howitzers above field guns, or only just over 2 per kilometre, while the proportion on the British front is some 13 to the kilometre, and on the French front just under 10. Here again, therefore, the amount of heavy artillery per kilometre on the Russian front is very much lower than with either the French or British armies only from one-fifth to one-sixth. .If, however, the number of guns per division is taken as a standard, the difference is not so striking. The Russians have now got about 27 guns of all sorts per division, just about the same as we had last July. It is true that our proportion has now risen to 35, while the French have 44, and the Germans in France over 50 ; but a general average equal to that with which we commenced the battle of the Somme cannot be considered entirely inadequate without further examination. From such an examination of the composition of the Russian heavy artillery it becomes apparent (a) That a&apos; very large proportion of the total consists of guns of very ancient date, e.g., out of 900 4&quot;2-in. guns more than 300 are of the year 1877 ; out of 570 6-in. guns 370 are of the same date.(6) That the proportion of guns to howitzers is much greater than is considered desirable by us, viz. : especially in the most important classea the 6-in., where the guns form 50 per cent, of the total, while in the heavier ratings they are over 70 per cent.(c) That Russia is very short of howitzers of 6-in. and upwards. Of these she has only&apos;7 20, while the figure for the British Army in France in October was 646, and the latter were almost entirely modern weapons.

It cannot be said that the above is an extravagant programme in any; way. It is obviously very much the reverse, especially in the medium guns and howitzers. It is particularly deficient in medium (6-in.) howitzers, which are almost universally looked upon as the most useful weapon for general purposes. But the total numbers required to complete this programme are very large, viz. : Category.Nature,To complete Equip-ment.Annual wastage.Total.To be supplied.Home.      AbroadI. II.III.

11. Before arriving at any conclusion regarding the extent to which we can assist in meeting these demands, it is necessary to examine the figures closely, and also to take into consideration the position at home as regards requirements and output.   The points of special importance are (a) The use made of old pattern guns available in Russia.(6) The percentage allowed for wastage.(c) The natures which can be most easily supplied from England. These will be discussed in the above order. .12. There is. no doubt that the idea permeating the whole of the Russian administration is that only the most up-to-date material is of-any value. This is quite obvious in any discussion. It was explained to the Russians how we ourselves, .the French, and the Italians were all using our oldest guns on our fronts, some more antiquated than anything they have, and it was impressed upon them that if full use was not made of the older patterns the British Government would be disinclined to supply new guns. The Grand Duke Serge stated categorically that far from this being the case they were utilising everything they had got; that their old fortress guns could be seen in action on the Northern Front, and that the guns which used to form the armament of their field artillery were used on frontier posts, and for the defence of mountain passes in Turkestan, the Caucasus, &amp;c. This is borne out by the number of old guns shown &quot;at the front,&quot; in paragraph 3. But it is a point to which special attention will be paid during visits to the front. As regards the number required to fulfil the &quot;programme&quot; given in paragraphs 9 and 10 no account is taken of such guns as the 90 mm. field guns given by the French, or of the Russian 6-in. guns of 120 and 190 poods (date 1877). In defence of this omission the Russians urge that it is not economical to recommence the manufacture of ammuni-tion of old natures, which had ceased to be made, and our own experience confirms this....13. It will have been noticed that a very large proportion of the above demands is for wastage. The figures are quite beyond anything in our experience, but on being challenged on this point the Russian authorities were. able to produce figures showing that their figures were based on their actual experience in this war. For technical reasons, which would be out of place here, there is no doubt that their guns, and more especially their howitzers, we&apos;ar out much more rapidly than ours. But we are chiefly concerned with the replacement of our own guns, and the figures given were admittedly based on their own experience with their own, and can therefore be largely discounted. With the amount of ammunition being supplied it is not likely that any of our howitzers will be worn out before next winter, while as regards the 60-prs. the position at home will not admit of any number being sent to Russia.14. As regards the natures which can be most easily supplied the following are the governing factors : (i) Owing to the enormous increase in the expenditure of field gun ammunitioncontemplated by G.H.Q., and provided for by the Ministry of Munitions, the total output of guns of this nature in England will probably prove insufficient to maintain in the field the guns with the army in France. No field guns can, therefore, be made available for Russia. We have, however, already arranged to supply a certain number of cradles and tubes, and these promises will be fulfilled. It is very desirable also that the number of cradles should be increased, if possible, as guns and carriages are avail-able in Russia, and only require these to complete.(ii) Owing to the great urgency for providing 4-in. guns to arm merchant shipsthe programme of gun construction has been entirely upset, and the production of long guns (such as 60-pr.) greatly curtailed.   It is therefore . desirable to avoid, if possible, diverting any of such natures to Russia.15. The question of utilising howitzers of over 6-in. calibre under the conditions prevailing on the Russian front has been considered. There seems no doubt that great difficulty will be experienced in the transport of these heavier natures and of their ammunition. On the other hand, the Grand Duke Serge when pressed on this point was emphatic as to the necessity for such natures, owing to the strength of the German defences. This again is a point which will be particularly inquired into at the front, but in view of the small number of heavy howitzers which the Russians have got it appears advisable to assist them with a small number of 8-in. and 9&quot; 2-in.
-   212A special request was made for a few 12-in. howitzers, but in view of the short life of these&quot;in France there seems no possibility of providing these.16. It is now possible to arrive at certain general conclusions as to the direction which any assistance which we may give to the Russian &quot;artillery should take. These may be stated as follows:- ^    .   .      m    t(i) The number of field, guns at present available in Russia is quite inadequatefor the defence of the front, and the proposed increase to 54 guns per division is justified, It is, however, impossible for Great Britain to help except with cradles.(ii) The number of field howitzers required for new formations is reasonable,but the number demanded for wastage is excessive. It is recommended that we undertake to send another 50 4&apos;5-in. as soon as Archangel opens to cover damage from shell fire and accident, and that we also undertake to replace during the winter any worn out during this year&apos;s campaign. The position at home does not permit of any general increase in the number of these howitzers, but the output of the Russian factories in 4* 8-in. should soon suffice to provide the full equipment required.(iii) Both in the present position and in the programme put forward there is amarked deficiency of medium and heavy howitzers, and especially of 6-in. The most valuable assistance would be in the form of 6-in. howitzers, with a smah proportion of 8-in., and 9&apos;2-in., which the Russians do not make themselves and cannot obtain elsewhere. This assistance wid gain greatly in value if it is regular and in complete units, and it is therefore recommended that we should undertake to send monthly after Archangel opens 4 batteries, 6-in. howitzers,2 8-in.1      ,,      9-2-in. ^ ,, and in addition, as in the case of 4&quot;5-in. howitzers, to replace during the winter any worn out during this year&apos;s campaign.(iv) As regards 60-prs., we cannot undertake to do more than replace thosealready provided as they wear out.Section B. Ammunition.; . - i17. The demands put forward for British type guns were based on exaggerated gun demands and showed a deficit below requirements; but it was agreed by the Grand Duke Serge that the scale on which the War Office proposed to ration the guns from England will be adequate.18, The quantity of ammunition which should be supplied on this basis for the guns to be in the country by the end of March should amount to the following. This includes 10,000 4-7-in. and 10,000 12-in. British type high explosive shell, which it is thought will be suitable for the 120-mm. Yickers gun in Russia and the Obukhov type of howitzer. Drawings of all these shells are being sent out in order to verify this point. They will be provided filled and fuzed. This ammunition should be shipped by the 1st May in order to be ready for the guns in June. .Amount of Ammunition to be shipjjed by 1st May.RoundsTonnage.4-5-in. -60-pr. -6-in. howitzers8-in.9-2-in.8-in.

In connection with these ammunition demands, it should be noted here that Russia has made preparations for a very considerable increase in her output of shell, particularly in the heavier natures, but in order to carry out this programme, it is essential that she should import shell steel from abroad. Many factories which are capable of turning out large quantities of shell, already stand idle for many days together for want of material, and while this is to some extent due to transport difficulties, it is mainly due to a real shortage of steel. The proportion of Russia&apos;s steel output which is made into shell steel is very considerable and is increasing at the expense of the output of rails and other steel requirements. Any further increase in the quantity of shell steel manufactured which was not accompanied by an actual increase in the gross steel output would have very harmful effects. It is, however, impossible to obtain shell steel abroad ; in every allied country the output of shell is :how limited by the shell steel output, and if Great Britain were to send shell steel, our output of shell would have to be reduced.21. If the fighting on the Western front continues of the same intensity throughout fJhe 1917 campaign as on the Somme, it will be impossible for us to cut our shell output at all without affecting the supplies required in France. The deficiency in Russia is, however, so acute that it is suggested that we should arrange to send Russia a regular supply of, say, 4,000 tons a week, from May onwards.It has been suggested by the French Mission that it would be desirable for us to send rails to Russia and let Russia concentrate her whole output in the making of shell steel, but the change over from shell steel output in Great Britain to rails would involve delay.22. In considering whether there is any advantage in Great Britain or France giving up steel to enable Russia to make shell, or making rails to enable Russia&apos;s transport system to be improved, an important factor is that of time. Steel sent to Russia now will pass through Archangel from June onwards, and in view of transport delays would not be likely to be ready as shell before September or October, while rails laid at that time would hardly affect this years operations and munition supplies, with the exception that rails might be ready at the front for an autumn advance. British and French steel, on the other hand, if made into shell at home, will be available on the Western front in the form of finished munitions by the early summer.23. On the other hand, delay is undoubtedly justified if it means that at a late period of the year, or even in 1918, instead of having the Western Armies over-supplied with ammunition which the guns are incapable of firing, and a famine in ammunition on the Eastern front, the Western front had a slightly less but fully adequate supply while the very large resources of men on the Eastern front have a sufficient munition supply to make their work effective.The details of this total ammunition, to he supplied are as follows
24. Moreover, we are now regularly supplying the French, with some 12,000 tons a week of shell steel, whilst to the Italians we are sending nearly 2,000 tons a week during the first quarter and shall probably have to continue throughout the year. But we are only sending Russia completed munitions for the guns we ourselves produce.:24. A convention with Russia to supply her with 4,000 tons for six months from June 1st onward would be a very great assistance to her, and, though it would limit our resources somewhat, could probably be done without very harmful effects. This form of assistance, moreover, would probably be better than increasing indefinitely the supply of British type artillery and munitions, for Russia&apos;s output of 4&quot;8-in. howitzers and 6-in. howitzers is fairly satisfactory and will doubtless improve. These types are short of ammunition, whereas at home we are making an amount of sheU which may possibly prove more than the guns can ever fire.25. The alternative to sending shell steel would, of course, be to make shell of Russian pattern and send it in the form of shell. The Ministry of Munitions would probably prefer to do this as it would keep our factories fully at work in the event of their being called upon to return to British type work. On the other hand, the Russian machining capacity is considerably in excess of Russians output, and as these factories already have the tools for Russian type shell, it would be most economical for them to be made in Russia. This question, however, is referred to below, under the heading of metal requirements.Section C--Trench Mortars.26. There is no doubt that the branch of the artillery in which Russia is most behindhand is that of trench mortars. What are called by them &quot; canons de tranchees &quot; are small guns of various calibres from 37 mm. to 3-in., mostly taken from the defence of ditches in fortresses. These are supplied for infantry for use against machine guns, in the same way as the French 37 mm. &quot; canon d&apos;accompagne-ment,&quot; and would be called by us &quot; infantry guns.&quot; They have not, however, been adopted in our service, and need not be further considered.27. As regards trench mortars proper, or &quot;lance mines,&quot; as the Russians call them, they are in possession of a considerable number of the old French Dumezil type, while several other types, some possessing original features, have been evolved in Russia, and a few specimens made for experimental purposes.   But no attempt whatever appears to have been made to organise trench mortar batteries; all that has been done is to issue the weapons available to infantry regiments.   In fact, the position is very much what it was in the British Army in the winter of 1914-15, the days of the old &quot;gas-pipes.&quot;   The results attained have been consequently insignificant, and the trench mortars are naturally very unpopular and rarely used. And yet with its present shortage of heavy artillery an adequate equipment of efficient mortar batteries would be of inestimable value to the Russian Army, especially fur wire cutting.   But our own experience, and that of our Allies, and especially of the Italians, shows clearly that to obtain good results with these weapons organisation and training are of primary importance.   It is probable that the 3-in. Stokes mortars could be used by the Russian infantry one has already been tried and liked in Russia but it seems little use providing heavier types unless with a clear understanding that Russia intends regularly to organise a branch of the artillery to man them, as has been found necessary in.all other countries..28. As regards requirements, the Russian demands from us are entirely for the heavy natures. Of these, the total to be provided is 2,400, of which it is proposed to make 120 in Russia (of 89 mm.), and to obtain the remainder from us in the shape of the 9&apos;45-in. (long).We have ordered 300 -heavy trench -mortars in addition to the 30 allocated to Russia by the War Office. We hope to deliver these by the end of May. Russia is asking for 1,930, but in view of probable improvements in type it would seem undesirable to order more than these 300 of the 9-45-in. type. We are supplying 150,000 rounds of ammunition, which should be supplied with the mortars, and could continue a supply of, say, 10,000 a week during the last half of 1917, or, say, oS0 mortars and 410,000rounds,in all as compared with a demand for 1,980 mortars and 900,000 rounds. - The mortars could, if desired, be increased during the last half of the year. This proposal involves about 28,000,tons,.of which about 11,000 should be available.for shipment beforethe:summer.o 2780 &apos; &apos; b
29. It is recommended that the Home Government he asked to send out at once 50 each of the 2-in. trench mortars and of the 3-in. Stokes, with a supply of 500 rounds per gun for the 2-in. and 1,000 for the Stokes. This supply would he ample to demonstrate the use and effectiveness of these weapons, and to permit the Artillery Department here to decide whether it would supply these itself.Neither of these types are really difficult to make, and it is important, in view of the transport situation, that if it is in any way possible these should be made in Russia.- If they cannot be made in Russia, and transport facilities are available, we could keep up an appreciable supply of both these after Midsummer, but for the present it is suggested that Russia should endeavour to turn these out herself.Section D. Aviation.30. In view of the close connection between the work of artillery and aeroplances, it has been considered most convenient to deal with aviation in the chapter devoted to artillery. Aeroplane observation is essential for modern artillery methods, and this means not only good observers, with wireless machines and wireless ground stations, but fighting machines to act as escort to them. At present it is not too much to say that there is almost an entire absence of co-operation between aeroplanes and artillery. In a few cases where they work together the methods are old-fashioned and cumber-some. In consequence, time and again the Russian infantry have been forced by the German artillery fire to abandon positions of great importance gained at great cost. We have learnt by many a bitter experience that to maintain a position the first essential is an efficient system of counter-battery work, and the foundation of counter-battery work is co-operation with aeroplanes. For this reason alone it Avill be of little benefit if we provide the Russians with artillery material unless we assist them at the same time with aeroplanes.31. The Russian aviation demands are considered on the whole to be fairly modest, and only amount, as far as Great Britain is concerned, to 130 machines in the first half of the year, and 685 motors. We are asked to bring this number up to 800 machines and some 3,000 motors (of which many will come from British orders in France) in the second half of the year. It is possible that some of these items for the second half of the year may even be brought forward into the first half, and if Major Valen-tine&apos;s work is Moscow is to be really effective, every effort should be made at home to get the machines out as soon as possible.The tonnage involved in the first half year&apos;s supply is 61,000 tons for engines and motors, and nearly 10,000 tons for additional equipment, the total equipment for the year from all countries amounting to 220,000 tons. These figures include machines to be supplied by France and Italy, which are more numerous than ours.It is of great importance that aeroplanes sent out from home should be complete in every respect, including machine guns, and that 75 per cent, should be equipped with wireless apparatus.32. The Russians are, in addition, asking for 1,600 Vickers machine-guns to fit on other type aeroplanes, while the Navy asks for a further 550 Vickers machine-guns for seaplane work. It is possible that all of these could be supplied in the second half of the year; the numbers to be supplied in the first half to be limited to the guns to be put on aeroplanes supplied with complete equipment.33. An adequate supply of wireless ground stations is also an essential portion of the machinery for ensuring co-operation between artillery and aeroplanes. These should be provided at the rate of one per heavy battery, one per group of field artillery (including field Howitzers), and two for each corps for use by commanders. This will amount to: Heavy artillery       - - -    500Field      ,, ...    750Corps      ,, - - -    1501,400 .The tonnage involved in the dispatch of the material dealt with in the present and preceding paragraphs is inconsiderable.Section E. Explosives and Propellants.34. Russia has at the present moment a fairly large stock of explosives and propellants, due to the fact that her purchases, together with her output, have
11   &apos;exceeded her ammunition output, which, as in the case of every other^ country, has hitherto been below programme. But explosive and propellant stocks disappear very rapidly when once the output of ammunition, and particularly of heavier nature, begins to rise, and at a conservative estimate which has been supplied to us by the officers of the&apos;French Mission, the explosive stock will have disappeared by April and the propellant by May. Even after allowing for normal deliveries from abroad, it is evident that foreign supplies of propellant and explosive are essential if Russia is to maintain even a reasonable increase in ammunition output, and nothing that Russia can do during 1917 will have much effect in increasing her home production.35. As regards propellants, Russia asks for 45,000 tons during 1917, but in view of the difficulty of completing Russia&apos;s shell programme this seems too high. It would appear to be reasonable to supply her with 30,000 tons, the estimate of probable requirements made by the French Commission varying from a minimum of 1,500 to a maximum of 3,000 tons a month. Capacity is available for this amount from Messrs. Dupont, but the Treasury has not sanctioned orders after 31st March. A wire should, it is tbougbt, be sent at once indicating the position and asking the&apos; Treasury for further sanction.   The Treasury is awaiting our report on this point.The Navy are also asking for 1,800 tons during the year, but it is understood that naval stocks are very large, and it is suggested that the Russian Government should be told that 30,000 tons will be financed from America during the year, and that, if necessary, the Navy must endeavour to obtain an allocation from tbe Ministry of War.36. In connection with this propellant situation, it was pointed out by the British delegates that if the programme, as put forward, were carried out. the Russian requirements would be met to the extent of no less than 70 per cent, from American supplies.It was urged that this position was one which should cause grave anxiety on political, financial, and military grounds. Great Britain had recently been in a similar position. The cost of maintaining these supplies was enormous, and, so long as we were so dependent upon Messrs. Dupont, America had the power of practically stopping our ammunition output, and this necessarily affected our diplomacy in dealing with America.Further, the stoppage of American shipment on account of submarine danger, strike, or any other cause, would reduce our programme by one-half. For these reasons, Great Britain was now taking steps to erect an enormous propellant factory, with an ultimate capacity of 1,000 tons per week, and the construction of this factory was receiving priority over every other munition work in England.The attempt to become independent of America would, however, be nullified if Russia should find herself in the autumn of this year in a practically similar position.37. The result of the discussion of this point was the suggestion that Japan should be strongly urged to place the whole of. her capacity for output at the disposal of the AUies, including even her Government factories. It was also suggested that a financial conference should discuss the possibility of developing the output of propeliants and other munitions from Japan. It is suggested, in this connection, that before the Commission leaves, a Japanese representative should be asked to attend, and this question raised in full conference.&apos;^&quot; It is true that the Vladivostock route into Russia is badly congested, but Mr. Bury may be able to make suggestions to alleviate the difficulty, while, if Japan could send some engines and rolling stock to Russia, a considerable quantity of goods might be carried. Moreover, the sea route is free from submarine danger, which is of special importance for ships carrying explosives, while Japan may also be induced to organise a quick service of ships.38. As regards explosives, Russia is asking for a considerable quantity of trotyl which probably cannot be supphed. The Artillery Department is using iSchneiderite, which is an explosive diluted to the extent of 85 per cent, with nitrate of ammonia for 3-in. shell and a dilution of 50 per cent! for shell of higher calibre. If Russia develops her heavy gun ammunition output, she will probably have to use a more dilute explosive than 50 per cent, nitrate of ammonia.Sufficient information is not available here to enable a definite allocation of explosives to Russia, but between two and three thousand tons a month will have to be supplied either by France or by ourselves.* There was no opportunity of carrying out this suggestion before the Mission left Russia.j 2
The most serious consideration in this connection is, however j that of Chili nitrate for the manufacture of nitrate of ammonia, the requirements of which amount to from 10,000 to 12,000 tons a month. This must be brought from Chili to Vladivostock, and complaint is made that the sailings are becoming very irregular since they have been controlled by the British Admiralty. At the moment there is only six w eeks&apos; stock in the country. These shipments require special consideration at home.Section F. Harness and Tractors for Artillery^39. The requirements of the Russian artiUery* as regards harness and saddlery are very large, viz., over 80,000 six-horse sets of harness and 20,000 saddles (in addition). Of these, home manufacture will provide nearly 40,000 sets of harness and 9,000 saddles, and France will contribute 3,500 sets of harness and all the saddles. There is thus left nearly 40,000 six-horse sets of harness to be obtained elsewhere.It was explained to us in support of this very large demand (a) that in view of the scarcity of railways and of good motoring roads itis necessary to keep a larger reserve of ammunition in horse-drawn ammunition columns and parks than is required in France ;(b) that in the great movements which have taken place on the Russian frontthe artillery has had to march very great distances, and that the harness is now very much worn out.40. Both the Grand Duke Serge, as representing General Headquarters, and General Manikovski, Chief of the Artillery Department at the War Office, impressed upon us the real seriousness of the position as regards artillery harness, and made very urgent appeals for assistance. It was explained that we were not in a position to make any promise in the matter, but that the facts would be put before the War Office on the return of the Commission to England.41. Tractors, &amp;c. Probably 800 Ruston and Clayton tractors can be supplied during the year out of 1,650 asked for. ^These are already on order and it is not thought they will be interfered with by W.O. work, unless it is by an increased demand for tanks,   is&apos; early 5,000 tons weight is involved.Three hundred F.W.D. will also be supplied, but no further demands can bemet.These combined will probably meet the requirements of the Artillery Department, as the full demands are based on a heavy gun equipment which cannot be provided.. One hundred of each type should, if possible, be sent through by May. This means a tonnage of 1,200 tons There are believed to be a certain number of lorries at Archangel and some more due on order from America. But it is doubtful if we can supply any appreciable number more by May.42. The Russians are finding considerable difficulty in getting competent drivers, and ask that we should if possible send a few good men who would be able to act as instructors both in driving and in the repair work which a driver should be able to do himself. -Section G. Murman Railway.43. The portion of the preceding items, viz., artillery and artillery ammunition, aeroplanes and equipment, trench mortars and ammuniticn, propellant and tractors, &amp;c, which should be shipped by May, amounts to about 146,000 tons.The Murman Railway has carried about 1,800 tons to date, and during the next four months will probably carry some 40,000 tons, and might conceivably handle 80,000 tons.As the.estimate of the capacity of Romanof this winter of 230,000 tons made by the Russian Government is considered by all our advisers to be far too optimistic, it is* Transport harness is dealt with in Chapter V, Section C, para. 102.
suggested that, in order to avoid confusion and delay, it should be made a condition of our assistance that this line should be exclusively reserved for these items and that the British authorities should be immediately cabled to load nothing else for Romanof from now onwards.Section H. Roumania.44. As regards Roumania, the agreement between the British and French Governments was that the Roumanian requirements should be communicated by General Berthelot to the French Government, and that the latter should then pass on to the British Government such portions as they were themselves unable to meet.The scheme drawn up by the French Military Mission for the reorganisation of the Roumanian artillery has been discussed with General Berthelot and is included in the comparative statement given in para. 9. Under the agreement referred to above the following have been demanded from England by France to complete this programme : 165      - -        - -        -    6-in. howitzers.105      - -        -        -        - 4&apos;5-in.88 105-mm. guns.*No objection can be made to the proposed scheme of reorganisation on the score of extravagance, and the French are supplying the guns required to complete the field artillery. This is essential before the Roumanian divisions now reforming can take the field.45. But the position as regards heavy artillery is very different. The Roumanian army occupies a. small section of the Eastern front, and, as pointed out in para. 8, the total amount of heavy artillery at the disposal of that front is very inadequate. Under these circumstances it would, on purely military considerations, be inadvisable to reduce the value of the comparatively small amount of heavy artillery which we can afford to give by earmarking any portion of it to the Roumanian army. The whole front should be treated as one. But it appears to have been represented in Rouniania that the British Government is pledged to give them 25 6-in. howitzers. But this seems to be due to a misunderstanding which needs to be cleared up.As regards field howitzers, in view of the demands for 4&quot;5-in. howitzers in other directions, it is not recommended that any of this nature should be given to Roumania. But Russia is prepared to cede to Roumania the 32 5-in. field howitzers provided by Great Britain last year, and these should prove a valuable addition to the strength of the Roumanian Army.For the reasons given in para. 14 (ii), any provision of 105-cm. guns is out of the question.   This has been explained to General Berthelot.46. Railway transit facilities for 120,000 tons of munitions in 1917 have been promised to Roumania by the Russians, and this is all that can be imported in execution of General Berthelofs scheme of re-armament, the total of which would require a very much greater amount of tonnage. It is, therefore, evident that even if we could provide the howitzers asked for, it could only be at the expense of other munitions.CHAPTER II.-SMALL ARMS, &amp;c. Rifles.47. The demand for rifles has been reduced, and in the latest statement presented it appears that England is no longer expected to supply any rifles from British American contracts.! In any case the demand for rifles could not have been given priority. The British American supply would have been forthcoming by next Christmas, and if America enters into the war the rifle factories wiU almost certainly be commandeered ; nothing, therefore, could in any case have been, aUowed for rifles.* This demand is not understood.t This was subsequently confirmed by the Minister of War.
-     - - S.A.A.48. Small arms ammunition is, however, a serious item. The Russian demands are on a scale which is extremely liberal, and the Minister of War was invited to consider the possibility of canceUing some of his American orders. But he is unwiUing to do so until the output from England reaches 200,000,000 a month .of Russian type.The small arms ammunition to be supplied from England and America will - weigh about 83,000 tons.Machine Guns.49. As regards machine guns, Great Britain is asked to supply about 2,400 Vickers guns and 650 for the Navy, while some Lewis guns will be supplied on British aeroplanes. This demand for the aviation type of Vickers gun can probably be met during the year.There are no other demands except those for which arrangements have already been made, with the exception of fusils-mitrailleuses which, are being asked for from Erance to the number of 90,000. We-cannot yet say what answer will be given in respect of these.&apos;:i:&apos;JPistol Ammunition.50. The request to continue a contract for Browning Automatic Pistol ammunition will be considered.   The weight involved is small.Optical Instruments.51. As regards optical instruments, there is - little hope of supplying rangefinders from England in view of the great shortage at home except as regards batteries sent from England which will have their proper allowance. The A/A position is especially bad.The demand for 124,000 binoculars, &amp;c, in America probably cannot be met in fuH, but some could be supplied.We may be able to arrange for perhaps a third, but the demand should be put forward in full. The War Department should, however, be warned that the American glasses are far inferior to those in* use in the Russian Army. The type should be agreed to in Russia before the order is placed.&apos;&apos;   The total value of the optical instruments! asked for amounts to 15 million roubles, and the weight to 300 tons.Signal Lights.52. The Russians seem to have been much impressed by the signal lights of our manufacture, which they have seen. Hence the large demand. It was explained to them that we could only supply of our own service pattern, and that it was not probable that we could spare as many as they have asked for; but that we could help them considerably. Tbe weight, 2,000 tons, value 4,300,000 roubles. But we cannot give any dates for delivery. They will probably ask permission to send an expert to see our methods in England, especiaUy as regards manufacture without aluminium.53. Eighty-six Vincent Flame Projectors are on order in England. This is an article with which we have obtained no success, though special efforts were made to vise them in the Somme offensive. Moreover, the Vincent is probably the least suitable of the types which have been experimented with. This is an instance of the way in which orders have been placed on the advice of irresponsible individuals referred to in para. 133. It is in every way undesirable that money should be spent and still more valuable tonnage taken up with useless articles. The matter has been represented to the Artillery Department.* As France could not offer more than 2,400 to meet this demand, we were subsequently asked for as many Lewis guns as could be spared of Russian calibre. We were not able to offer any more than the existing order for 5,000.&quot; &apos; t The Artillery Department have arranged to examine some American binoculars and communicate with General Poole.J It. was subsequently agreed that Russia should have the output of the British Hotchkiss Company, which&apos;should yield for Russia at least 5,000 guns this year.
CHAPTER III.-METALS. 54. Demands were made for the following supplies of metals to be imported :  Metaux Noirs. Tons. .Steel and iron bars, blooms, billets and cast iron 1,037,000 Rails    -                                     -        -     351,000 Wire    ------     112,000Other items of steel and iron   -        -        -     163,000Total &quot; metaux noirs&quot; - 1,663,000  1,663,000Metaux &quot; blancs et rayes. &quot;Copper -         -         -	104,300Lead	80,000Tin                -        -     - -	9,000Zinc     -         -         -         -	44,000Antimony        -	6,400Nickel  -        -         -	4,600Aluminium      -	17,100Various ferrous metals -	19,500Other metals    -	5,000Total   -	-    289,900289,900Grand Total   -        -        -  1,952,90055. The figure for &quot; metaux noirs &quot; represents a reduction on requirements from abroad which are put at 2,700,000, but reduced in view of the impossibility of obtaining transport for so large a quantity. The present figure will, however, be again divided by the Department into three parts in order of urgency.^ It is said that none of these demands can be met from Sweden, as Germany has purchased aU the available supplies.Russia&apos;s anticipated output in 1917 of the above classes of &quot; metaux noirs &quot; is as follows: Tons.Steel, iron, blooms, &amp;c.        -        -        -        -  3,076,000Rails -        -        -        - -        -     384,000Wire -------     277,000Other items   -        -        -        -        -        -     776,000Total        -        -        -  4,513,00056. One million one hundred and sixty thousand tons are required from home and abroad for shell steel. This quantity is needed for a period of 16 months, i.e., at the rate of about 17,000 tons a week.   It is proposed to obtain this as follows: Home Output.   Import. Tons. Tons. .3-in. shell       -        -        -        -  200,000       200,000   . Large shell     - 260,000       500,000460,000      700,000 Total        -        -        -   1,160,000It is, however, quite impossible to import so large a quantity as 700,000 tons of shell steel into Russia, and unless Russia&apos;s ammunition programme is to be reduced, means must be found to increase the home outport.This has not yet been done.
57. At the end of this chapter a short statement is attached summarising the conclusions of those members of the French Mission who have studied this question, from which it appears that by the adoption of the mono-bloc process of shell forging a, saving of 20 per cent, in the steel consumption would be secured; while an improvement in organisation in the Donetz region will, it is believed, have the effect of increasing output by about 40 per cent.It is suggested that the proposal of the French Mission to ask for the appointment of some one person iD charge of the whole Donetz coal&quot; and iron transport, and the distribution of coal in that area should be pressed upon the Russian Government by the present Mission.53. There is, moreover, the question of labour. The Minister of War stated, and all our other information confirms the fact, that the output of merals has been seriously affected by the indiscriminate calling up of men to the colours. There appears to have been a system of card exemptions in the towns, but this has not appreciably affected the industrial, mining and steel manufacturing districts. In the Donetz region the men have been replaced by prisoners, and it is said that in the case of the Austrians in South Russia they work fairly well with the Russians. But the shortage of labour is stiU acute, and is, of course, most acute as regards skilled men.59. Efforts are now being made to obtain releases from the colours, but so far with only modest results. As in all countries, the generals are unwilling to spare their best men, while the scheme in operation is one for the release of named individuals a method which was tried in England in 1915 and abandoned after a couple of months. Frequently, the men could not be traced to their units, were dead, captured or in hospital, or, when found, proved to be a namesake of the real man required. The Ministry of Munitions, therefore, with the help of the War Office, put into force a scheme for &quot; releases in bulk,&quot; under which men of specific occupations were paraded and examined by a travelling commission consisting of an officer from the War Office, a Member of Parliament who was frequently able to overcome the reluctance and even enlist the sympathy of the C.O.&apos;s, and a labour investigator , competent to deal with the credentials of each man. Under this scheme 30,000 skilled or semi-skilled men have been brought back to industrial work.&apos; 60. The output of coal and steel is limited by transport facilities; but even if this can be overcome by improving waggon circulation, the output would still be kept down by lack of labour. With a moderate increase in the number of skiUed men at work it is believed that the output of steel (which could be used for either shells or rails) could he increased in the Donetz region by 25 per cent., and the output of coal by possibly a larger proportion. It is therefore suggested that the Russian Govern-ment should be strongly urged to release suitable men from the colours in large numbers.It is also understood that there is a certain amount of labour inadequately employed in factories which are short of work. If this is the case, some advantage might be gained if..such men were enrolled and transferred under a War Munition Volunteer scheme..61. It is suggested that if improvements can be made in the organisation of labour and in the organisation of industry in the Donetz area itself, the British Government should offer to supply shell steel at the rate of 4,000 tons per week for six months,- and that this undertaking should be conditional upon steps being taken to improve the Russian output. It is, however, not to be anticipated that the increase in output will be effective at once, which makes it all the more important that the assistance to be rendered should begin immediately Archangel opens:It is not thought that any other assistance as regards black metals can be given, except, possibly, as regards steel rails. This point will be dealt with in the next chapter.62. The importance of the development of Russia&apos;s own resources cannot be too strongly insisted on, as Russia is the only one of the Allies which has really large resources in rich iron ore. The relative output of munitions of the Allies and the CentralPowers is in a large measure determined by their resourcesin steel. France&apos;s ore fields have been captured by the enemy, Italy has practically no ore resources at all, while Great Britain has to carry half her ore supplies from Spain through
?281,500These figures only involve small additional orders for zinc, antimony and nickel. When, however, the Russians have had time to reconsider their programme in the light of the arrangements now being made they may wish to modify some of these items.   The above distribution should, therefore, be regarded as provisional.66. Economy of Metals. There is no doubt that the Russians have not, up to date at any rate, really even considered the question of economy of metals. Their first and most glaring instance is in their use of &quot;case&quot; ammunition. All their guns and howitzers of modern type are provided with these even up to 8-in. and 12-in.(?) howitzers. That for the 6-in. gun weighs lbs. There is no thought of even trying steel cases as the Germans have been doing, or of reducing the size of driving bands to save copper. In fact, the whole idea of the necessity for economy in such matters seemed strange to them. They have, however, certainly changed from aluminium to brass for some of their time fuzes, though they are still making their fuze covers of aluminium. The possibility of using cast iron for fuzes had never occurred to anyone, but when it was suggested they appeared quite ready to take, it up.   For this,&apos; however ar0   2780 - c&apos;submarine-infested seas. Russia is the only country which is completely self-sufficient in this respect, and yet her output of steel is declining, and she is endeavouring to obtain large importations. If the war continues into 1918, Russia&apos;s steel output will become a vital factor.63. As regards other metals, about half of the copper demand is being met by-purchases for Russia in America, in Australia, and in Japan. The Russian production is anticipated to be 25,000 tons, but it was subsequently stated that an additional 5 000 tons would be available from the Caucasian mines. It is not practicable to ge% anything like the quantity asked for abroad, and here again Russia must develop her own production as far as possible. .In this connection, the Artillery Department have been urged to make economies in the use of copper by reducing the amount used in copper bands, by considering alternatives as regards fuzes, and by diminishing the use of brass vide (para.. 66). The British and French Governments have made a formal representation to the Russian Government that as the twro former countries have had absolutely to prohibit the use of copper in non-war work, Russia should do the same.64. Of the other metals, lead and tin are both difficult to obtain, but further quantities could probably be purchased if the orders already placed should prove insufficient.Zinc is already being arranged for to the extent of at least half the total requirements. The demand will be reduced if Russia is able to economise in brass, while the careful utilisation of swarf in the factories may, perhaps, enable the requirements to be kept low. It is suggested that 30,000 tons for the whole year represents a fully adequate supply.The demand for nickel can be reduced, while aluminium can only be supplied to the extent of 4,500 tons during the year. This represents the same allocation to Russia as has already been made to the various users of aluminium in England. Russia will probably accept this, as she is shortly starting the manufacture of aluminium.The ferrous metals are already practically arranged for.65. To sum up, it is suggested that an endeavour should be made during 1917 to supply the following in addition to steel rails : -Tons.Shell steel - -        -        - - -   100,000Copper   -        -        -        -        -        -        -     60,000Lead      - - -        - - -     60,000Tin        -        -        - -        -        -      5,000Zinc      -        -        -        -        - 30,000Antimony - - - - -       5,000Nickel &apos; - &apos; -        -        -        -        -      2,000Aluminium - - - -        I- -       4,500Fontes speciales - - - - - 15,000Other metals      ------
expert would be required wbo knew the sort of cast iron required, and tbe way to work it, and tbe Chief of the Artillery Department said that he would take it as a great favour if we could send him such a man from England. Generally speaking, however, the point of view is the same as has been alluded to in para. 12, to insist on the highest possible quality throughout. This is well exemplified in the Russian note on the French proposal to use &quot;fonte acieree &quot; for shells.67. But if the Russians are extravagant in using only the best, they are careful as regards recovery of fired ammunition cases, &amp;c. The rules as regards the return of fired cases appear to be much stricter than with us, and they have a regular salvage organization at work at the front which brings in all sorts of metals, including steel. This is a matter which will be more fully reported upon after its actual working has been seen at the front.In connection with the supply of metals, the following conclusions arrived at by the members of the French Mission on the steel situation are of interest.68. How can the production of steel be increased f The works in the South could, with their present facilities (blast furnaces, steel works, rolling mills), produce about 40 per cent, more steel than they do at present. However, they are short of coke. Work is continually interrupted, and the restarting each time necessitates an extra -consumption of fuel.Cause of the lack of coke :(1) The big mines lack skilled workmen, who should be brought back from the front.(2) There are too many small mines working and working badly who supplyinferior coal and uselessly absorb too much labour. (3) Transportation is bad; the coal lies at the mine head and impedes theworking of the mines. (4) The coal is badly distributed, both as regards quantity and quality, havingregard to the use to which it is to be put; there are too many localcommittees, who are not always well informed regarding requirements.&quot;Conclusion. One single organisation for the whole of the South should be created under the command of a single, energetic Chief, who should have entire control over the distribution of the coal and the railway trucks in which it is to be transported. Adequate powers should be given to this Chief, who should have under his orders a sufficient number of local supervisors whose duty it should be to keep him informed.69. How can the steel requirements be reduced or better use be made of the steel produced? Certain works could increase their production by reducing waste. In particular, covers for the ingot heads with refractory linings should be brought into general use for retarding the cooling of the head, as is already the case in certain larger works. This process reduces the internal shrinking, and consequently one is able largely to reduce the extent of the subsidence from 28 per cent, to 15 per cent. This means a saving in metal of about 13 per cent.In conclusion, the French Mission has suggested that the screw-base shell should be replaced by the mono bloc shell similar to the French type which takes much less metal and requires a great deal less workmanship. In this way a saving of 20 per cent, in metaland 40 per cent, in working up can be effected.CHAPTER IV. RAILWAY MATERIAL.70. The demand for railway material is represented by the Russian Government as being next in urgency to that for heavy artillery, and certainly the condition of the transport system proves at the present time extremely inefficient, limiting the output of metals and of munitions of all kinds and impeding the movement of those which are produced or imported. We have not, however, received any information showing the work done by the rolling stock, such as car or engine mileage, and without such information it is impossible to say to what extent the present deplorable situation is due to faulty management, and to what extent to actual shortage of rolling stock. This is a matter on which Mr. Bnry will be able to give an opinion, but his researches are only just beginning, and it is, therefore, not possible in the following notes to make any thorough criticism or comment on the position as put before us.The following is, therefore, to be regarded entirely as provisional.
71 The problem of supplies of railway material is accentuated by the followingdifficulties :  .In the first place the home supplies are tailing, as is shown in the note at the end of this chapter. The reduction is due to the fact that the steel output is stationary,, and even declining,and an increasing proportion of that which is available is being taken for munitions. The loco and wagon works are also engaged in making munitions.72. On the other hand, the amount of transport to be done has enormously increased. Before the war Petrograd relied on British coal for its supply, which was brought from the Baltic. Now the demand in Petrograd, which has increased through the large munition output of this area, has to be met from native sources, and in this connection Polish coal is no longer available. Practically the whole coal and iron industry of Russia which is now working is that of the Donetsky area, and both the steel which is used in the north and the coal for both transport and private purposes has to come from South Russia.Efforts are being made to circulate trucks in a triangular way from the Petrograd and Moscow provisioning areas to the front, from the front to the Donetsky area, and from there to North Russia ; but it is not easy to keep to this scheme, especially when the Generals at the front are clamouring for supplies.Moreover, while it is essential to limit the amount of rolling stock at the front as-far as possible, it is of course essential that a large supply should be available there, as otherwise the troops are practically immobilised and cannot be concentrated at any point of attack.&quot;73. For these and other reasons the rolling stock requirements have been enormously increased, but the additions from the Russian factories are low, while before the war the condition of the stock had apparently been allowed in certain respects to deteriorate.During the war nearly 400 locomotives have been delivered from America, together with 33 from Belgium ; 13,000 cars have been passed through Vladivostock, and some 205,000 tons of rails.There are still due from abroad 300 locomotives from America, and 40 more from Belgium; 3,000 50-ton cars, 3,000 20-ton cars, and 370,000 tons of rails.74. The additional demands for railway material to be ordered from abroad now put forward include 754,000 tons of rails, 920 locomotives, 26,760 cars, and a large variety of other demands, -which total 1,700,000 tons, of which only 860,000 tons will have to be transported by rail into the interior, though, of course, the whole quantity will have to be carried by sea. These demands are, of course, entirely out of the question.The present orders involve a tonnage of something like 700,000 tons of shipping transport. The 370,000 tons of rails will, with the amount of material already in stock at Vladivostock, very nearly occupy the port for the whole of 1917, but of course all rolling stock that can be put on rail at Vladivostock will tend to increase the capacity of that port to receive other munitions.75. It is therefore desirable that as much rolling stock, and particularly loco-motives, as possible should be landed at Vladivostock, and though it is improbable that any orders can be placed in America for delivery before October, which probably means arrival at Vladivostock about Christmas, it is desirable that all possible orders should be placed which may materialise next winter.This is important for other reasons, among which may be mentioned the fact that delay in placing orders last July was responsible for a break in deliveries of rolling stock at Vladivostock at the present time, while there is also the consideration that if the war continues until 1918 it will be important to give every possible assistance to Russia through Vladivostock during the winter 1917-1918. Orders placed now wdll increase capacity at this season.76. In this connection the suggestion is made below (Chap. VIII.) that the Japanese Government should be approached with a view to lending or selling either new or second-hand rolling stock, and arranging for its transport to Vladivostock or Dalny. They should also be asked, if possible, to supply rails, to be used for double tracking parts of the Siberian Railway.11. As regards additional orders for rails the need is extremely urgent, particularly in order to build up a stock for use at the front.   In this connectionc 2
the figures given below show that if the Russian demand for rails is analysed into more urgent and less urgent requirements, the former class involves some 10,000 versts, of which 6,000 are for use at tbe front.It is highly improbable that any orders that could be placed now could be delivered in time for this year&apos;s campaign, or, if they could be delivered, could be transported in addition to the orders already placed, and therefore these demands will have to be met, if met at all, by taking up lines in Russia, probably in European Russia, in places where traffic is unimportant.78. If, however, steps can be taken during the year to increase by a considerable amount the carrying capacity of the Siberian railway, it would be possible to move a considerable quantity during next winter, and orders for this purpose should be placed now.It is, moreover, not unreasonable to assume, in calculating what tonnage should be ordered, that a carrying capacity will be available in the spring of 1918 in excess of present facilities, and these additional orders for rails have therefore not been entered in the balance sheet in the tonnage to be set against ihe carrying capacity of 1917.It is possible that orders could be placed now for delivery in America in the last quarter of this year to the extent of possibly 200,000 tons, and this quantity is included in a rough estimate of the amount for which financial arrangements might now be made.79. It is also proposed that additional orders for rolling stock to the amount of 100,000 tons, for delivery next year, should be placed in America or Canada. The allocation of this as between locomotives and wagons will have to be decided after further consultation with the Russian Government. In this connection it is suggested that inquiries should be made at once, but that the final conclusion of contracts should be delayed until Mr. Bury has reported.80. As regards the condition of rolling stock, &amp;c, the following information has been supplied by officers of the Ministry of Transport: Locomotives.The stock of locomotives on the 1st January was 20,560, but it is to be assumed that at any moment 15 per cent, of these are under repair.&quot;:;:&quot; The problem of keeping locomotives in good condition is an extremely difficult one, for two reasons: (1) the age of the stock and (2) the constant and hard usage it is receiving.81. As regards the first point, 25 per cent, of the stock is over 30 years old, the stock in existence having been procured in the foUowing decades :  Up to 1860 -        -        -        -        -        - 1281360 to 1870 -        -        -        -        -        - 1,8121870 ,, 1880 ------ 3,2671880 ,, 1890 ------ 1,2991890 ,, 1900 -        -        -        -        -        - 5,4781900 ,, 1910 ------ 2,27182. As regards the second point, the locomotives are commonly worked for 24. hours a day, and are taken over by crew after crew.   It is therefore impossible to keep them properly clean.83. The following table shows the home production of locomotives for a series of years. The first nine figures refer to 0-8-0 type engines and those for 1915-16 to the more powerful 0-10-0 type : 1906 - - - 1,281 (0-8-0)1907 - - - - 7551908 - - - - 6411909 - 5141910 - - - - 4951911 - - - - 4161912 - 3061913 - - - - 5351914 - - - - 749 plus 37-750 mm. engines.1915- - - - 910 (0-10-0) plus 65 \ 398 U.S.A. locos.1916 - - - - 587             plus 200)    also delivered.The actual figure was apparently 17 per cent, in February and was rising.
It is estimated that the locomotive shops could make from 65 to 70 locomotives a month without interfering with the gun carriage and other munition output which is being made in these shops, provided the necessary steel could be obtained. The workshops in Harbin could assemble from three to five foreign locomotives a day.84. The American locomotives referred to in the above table were ordered before the present arrangement for dealing with American orders. Under the new regime 300 locomotives have been ordered. Further, 80 locomotives have been purchased from Belgium, 33 of which have been received, 4 sunk, and 6 returned, as they could -not be unloaded by the cranes available at Archangel. The rest are expected soon at Romanoff, and it is thought that they can be dealt with there.The proportion of &apos; existing locomotives which are used at the front was not given.Cars.85. The total stock in the country on January 3rd was 565,000, of which about 5 per cent, are always under repair. Of the total number 150,000 are in use at the front.86. The output of cars in Russia since 1906 has been as follows : 1906 - 20.718 1912 - - - 9,4181907 - - - 13,768 &apos;  1913 - - - 18,6101908 - - - 8,578 1914 - - - 29,1571909 - - - 2,743 1915 - - - 28,4581910 - - - 7,248 -   1916 - - - 20,4651911 - - - 6,736In the early years these were 10 or 12 ton cars, but at the comparatively slow speed obtaining in Russia it has been found possible to increase the weight carried without danger.In the later years they refer to 18-ton cars, which in fact carry 20 tons of freight without danger.87. Under the old regime Russia bought, in addition to the above, 5,060 gondola cars, 4,100 40-ton cars from the Car Foundry Company, and 2,000 from the Pressed Steel Company, 2,000 from the Canadian Eastern Car Company, together with 60 platform cars from the Pressed Steel Compauy, and 150 platform cars from the Car Foundry Company. Of these 13,013 have been delivered and assembled, only about 200 having been lost.Under the new regime Great Britain has ordered 3,000 50-ton gondola cars and 3,000 20-ton cars from the Eastern Canada Company.Pairs of wheels have also been bought for the Russian factories.Hails.88. The following is the output of Russian rails since 1906 :-Thousand Poods.       k Thousand Poods.1906 - - - 14.346 1912 - - - 34,3101907 - - - 11,732 1913 - - - 29,6721908 - - - 12,962 1914 - - - 33,463.1909 - - - 19,331 1915 - - - 27,8061910 - &quot; - - 19,717 1916 - - - 10.9351911 - 24,744These figures refer to first-class rails only, but it is necessary now to make rails of inferior steel. In 1916 the output of rails, including these second-grade rails, was 20,216 thousand poods.89. The following gives in thousand tons the output of rails from Russia, and second, the amount ordered from abroad, including an estimate for the year 1917. It will be observed from the note that 370,000 tons should be delivered in 1917 in respect of orders placed during the past year. It is definitely stated that the serious decline in the Russian output is due to lack of steel and not to lack of rolling capacity. This capacity is required for rolling steel used in various munition works, includingC 3
shell work, but there is an ample margin of rolling capacity for a much larger rail output if steel could be obtained.- 	Made in Russia.	Ordered from Abroad.

The demand for rolling stock, and in particular for locomotives, is unlimited. The demand for rails amounts to some 1,400,000 tons, of which 645,000 tons are regarded as extremely urgent. The analysis of this very urgent demand is as follows: 		Normal Gauge.	750-mm. Gauge.		Versts.	Versts.		6,000	1,075	New lines*     -      -      -      -	1,717	Nil.

A large number of demands have been received from many Ministries and detailed lists of these are available.Before summarising in regard to weight, &amp;c, the following points may be noted in connection with some of the more important items.Section A. Admiralty.93. 100 130-mm. guns for ships under construction and for rearmament are asked from England. These calibre guns, it is said, have been used in land bombardment on the Riga Gulf and are rapidly wearing out. There are 161 now mounted; 84 in the Baltic and 77 in the Black Sea. Russia&apos;s output is only enough for new cruisers.   This demand is therefore put forward as of extreme urgency.100 4-inch guns are needed to increase the number of guns on torpedo boat destroyers from two to four and to mount on patrol ships and trawlers. New works in Petrograd wiU ultimately be capable of turning out 25 guns a month, but not for some time to come.94. It was specially urged in regard to these two items that the Russian Navy is making guns for the Army, and that if these are not granted they will have to stop
manufacture. There is practically no hope of these demands being met in view of the need for 4-inch guns at home for arming merchant vessels.95. The Admiralty also ask for 40-mm. anti-aircraft guns but admit that the weapon is of very little value.6 000 tons of picric are asked for to fill mines for the Baltic. Information as to naval stocks will be supplied. It may be necessary to make a special effort to supply 1,000 tons by May.The Navy also ask for 1,800 tons of propellant, but if 30,000 tons a year from American orders are allocated to Russia, the distribution between the Army and the Navy should be left to tbe Russian Government.Large quantities of material for submarine netting, anchor chains, &amp;c. are asked for. It will be for the British Admiralty to say which items of these can be supplied, but it is suggested that it is not possible to aUot any considerable cargo capacity to these demands.96. The demands also include a number of ships for various purposes, and of these items the request for 10 tugs for use in the White Sea is extremely important. The White Sea is by far the most important entry into Russia and it is of extreme urgency that everything which wiR increase the capacity of the port should be made available immediately.This demand, with demands for cranes, loading and unloading gear, &amp;c. should probably be placed ahead of all other requirements.Section (B). Technical Department of the War Office.97. These demands consist of various engineer stores (including barbed wire) and mechanical transport.As regards wire, there are .910,000 tons in the country, of which 60,000 tons are at Vladivostock, but they cannot be moved owing to congestion of the railway.The new demand for barbed wire from abroad is for 210,000 tons, while the Russian Government also ask for 110,000 tons of wire to be barbed in Russia in addition to the barbed wire manufactured as barbed wire in the country. Special steps have been taken to develop this work, and it is now believed that 13,000 to 14,000 tons can be barbed a month.There does not seem any prospect of getting through Vladivostock the quantity o  wire asked for, and it would seem desirable to limit purchases to the 110,0u0 tons of unbarbed wire for Russia&apos;s own workshops.Russia produces all her telegraph materials with the exception of some already ordered in Japan, but is dependent on foreign sources for wireless material, and under this head some small special orders may be required in addition to those already placed.98. The great bulk of the requirements of this department consists of motor transport vehicles, which are asked for to the tune of about 850,000 tons, half of which is asked for from Italy.99. Supplies from Great Britain will probably not exceed 70,000 tons. This would largely consist of caterpillar tractors, of which we hope to supply some 800, and of four-wheel drives, of which probably 400 could be supplied.The large demand for lorries from England can probably not be met, and it is-doubtful whether any orders can be placed bej^ond those already authorised, but France and Italy should be able to meet a considerable proportion of the lorry requirements.100. It is doubtful whether it will be possible to deal with more than 40,000 tons of engineers stores in addition to the above.Section (C). Intendance Department.101. The demands of the intendant&apos;s department amount to 315,000 tons, including various kinds of cloth, leather for boots, saddles, harness, &amp;c.A very considerable proportion of the cloth is supplied in Russia, and with orders already placed abroad will go a long way towards meeting requirements, except in the case of cloth for tunics and lighter garments. The amount involved is not, however, very considerable, even, in the latter.case.
The situation as regards supply, in fact, for all these demands&apos; is probably more satisfactory, apart from new orders, than in any other department.102. The only items upon which the Minister of War lays special stress are harness&apos;51&apos; for one and two horse vehicles. In the case of single-horse harness, he will be 33 per cent, short of requirements unless additional orders are placed abroad, and in the case of two-horse harness 27 per cent, short of requirements.In view of the importance of horse transport great emphasis is laid on the need for these orders. There ought not to be serious difficulty in meeting these require-ments from the point of view of production.103. Probably the essential requirements of this department can be got down to, say, 40,000 tons.Section (D). Sanitary Service.104. The demands for this service amount to 15,000 tons. We have no means here of judging whether this is all essential. The demands include certain medical instruments, formerly made in Germany, but of which Russia has commenced pro-- duction, e.g., clinical thermometers, specimens of which were presented to us, but the output of these is still very small. It is, however, suggested that next year Russia may be independent in this respect.In the absence of any means of criticism these requirements must be entered at their full value.Section (E). Trade and Commerce.105. The requirements of the Ministry of Trade and Commerce are entered at 500.000 tons, of which a great part consists of raw materials of commerce.Commercial materials.106. The total of materials amounts to 452,000 tons, of which 16,000 tons is rubber for military purposes only. The department has made no allowance for rubber for other purposes, though the Russian monthly consumption indicates that 3,000 tons more is required.18,000 tons represents machinery for tanneries, and cloth and cotton mills, &amp;c, and it is stated that this demand almost entirely consists of spare tools and machinery required to replace that worn out.   There is practically no new equipment included.108,000 tons of cotton is asked for, 14,000 tons of jute, and 13,000 tons of wool.Tea is down for 58,000 tons; coffee, cocoa, and other food products at 25,000 tons.50,000 tons of sugar is asked for owdng to the fact that the armies are encamped on the best beet fields of Russia, while in other areas lack of proper transport has prevented the beet being manufactured into sugar.17,000 tons of sulphur are required from Italy for war purposes, for though the Caucasus and other areas produce sulphur, the product is not pure enough for the manufacture of explosives.107. The department will supply a statement of each of these products imported in 1916, with figures, so far as they are known, of stocks in Russia, and the condition of affairs in each of the industries concerned.&quot;)&quot;It is, however, obvious that this quantity cannot be brought into the country by sea except at the expense of munitions, and it will be for the Government to say what proportion of these industrial needs must be sacrificed.108. The Ministry of Trade also deals with the ports, with mines, and with a Certain number of munition factories, which, for historical reasons, are managed by this department instead of by the Ministry of War.Port Equipment.109. As regards the ports, the department is asking for 60 8-10-ton cranes and seven floating cranes, which must have their own means of locomotion. They are also asking for automatic and labour saving machinery for handling coal, and for an additional supply of tugs.* For artillery harness, see Chapter I., Section (F),      39, 40.t Certain information on these points is contained in Part V. of this report.
In view of the explosion at Archangel, moreover, there is urgent need for motor fire engines; two floating docks, one of which should take 5,000-ton ships, and 15 ice-breakers, are also asked for.110. In view of the possibility of war continuing until 1918, it is suggested that the installation of automatic plant for handling cargo should be pressed forward, though the plant is not likely to become effective until this autumn; while everything possible should be done in the way of supplying cranes and tugs to enable the port to reach its maximum capacity.Excluding ice-breakers, which probably cannot be supplied, the demands represent from 15-20 million roubles worth of equipment, most of which is for Archangel.Mining Machinery.25 million roubles worth of equipment is asked for in respect of machinerv for working mines, &amp;c, the tonnage being 1.4,000 tons.A good deal of this is said to be labour saving machinery, and the remainder to be necessary in view of the bad condition into which it is alleged the machinery at the mines has fallen.Most of this is to be-bought in America, but in view of the somewhat experimental character of the attempt to introduce labour saving devices in the mines, it may be doubted whether it is expedient to regard this request as of special urgency.Armament Factories.112. There remain the armament factories under the Ministry of Trade. The chief item of the demands under this head is a 7,000-ton press, which is required at the Perm gun factory, which is making heavy guns up to 12 inches and even 14 inches for the -Navy.This factory has not&apos; hitherto been a main source of supply for the largest type of Russian naval guns, and it is not clear that it is necessary to equip another heavy gun factory during the war.The heavy howitzers for the Army still continue, as before, to be made at Obukhov, but the case for so large a piece of machinery is based on the fact that there is only one similar piece of machinery in Russia, and that if this broke down the forging of large guns would be stopped.It is, however, a very cumbersome piece of machinery to get through to Russia under present circumstances.Section (F). Agriculture.113. The Minister of Agriculture asks for 477,000 tons of goods, including machinery for the timber trade, rice and rice bags, and agricultural implements. Details have not yet been supplied,&apos;^ but it is understood that the want of agricultural machinery is very great.If these machines are divided into cultivating and food preparing machinery, it is the latter which must be regarded as the more urgent, for the transfer of many millions of men and horses to one part of the country means that food which was previously hardly handled at all has to be packed and transported.Hay is being imported at this moment because machinery is not available for pressing and cutting Russia&apos;s own crops, which are always ample.In the absence of details, however, it must be left for the Russian Government to indicate what relative importance they attach to these demands.o   2780*&apos; Information on these points will be found in Part V.D
CHAPTER VI. TRANSPORT CAPACITY.114. The following table shows the Russian estimates of transport capacity from various available ports compared with estimates arrived at after consultation between British and French officials : Russian Official Figures.Railway and Canal Capacity.Port discharging Capacity.ArchangelKern      -Romanov Finland  -Vladivostock  -Total3,075,000 500,0002,040,0001,246,000 1,174,0008,035,0004,742,000 500,0002,390,000500,000 4,585,50012,717,500Shipping available.figures given.Probable Capacity.Maximum Possible ShippingPort Capacity. available.Archangel      -----   2,572,000) n rnnKern     -     -     -     -     -     -1 t 2,700,000^em I   726.000)726,000 459,000Vladivostock  -     -     -     -     -     624,000 700,000RomanovFinland ------     459,000 ?Total-     -     -     -  4,381,000 ,3,400,000115. The shipping total represents an increase of over 50 per cent, on the amount shipped last year, and in view of the present shipping position is optimistic. A cautious estimate would probably put the total probable import at something less than last year&apos;s figure (we were not able to get precise figures of last year&apos;s total); and if the suppression of the submarine menace is not completed until the autumn, the Russian Government may even have to legislate for a blockaded country except as regards such material as may come from Vladivostock ; and it should have its plan prepared on this assumption.116. Arrangements should, however, be made by the Allies on the most favourable assumptions as to the possibility of supplying munitions to Russia, and it is suggested that it would not be unreasonable to provide 4  million tons of material to allow for losses, delays in delivery, &amp;c, in addition to goods that may be supplied from Sweden.In basing proposals on this estimate, however, two considerations have to be borne in mind.117. In. the first place, the interests of the Alliance as a whole cannot permit of ships returning empty from Russia, and it is understood that, in addition to exports of flax and timber, the Russian Government have undertaken to supply 500,000 tons of wheat for France and England. To handle this export at Archangel without delaying ships or trains will require the most careful organisation, which is to be entirely in the hands of the French.For the avoidance of delay, it is essential to ascertain (a) whether the Russian Government have made all the necessary arrangements at the points where the export is to take place, and (b) to make sure that the proposed French organisation will work smoothly and harmoniously with the present British arrangements at the port.118. In the second place, it is to be feared that the labour conditions which were bad in 1916, and have been made more difficult by the recent explosions, should be placed on a satisfactory basis in anticipation of the additional work which the port will be called upon to perform in the coming season. In this con-nection, it is suggested that shore labour handling general cargo at the port should
27 * .be taken, over by tbe military authorities and run on the lines of a regular base for the army in the field. This plan would (a) save the loss of time from public holidays ; (6) maintain the supply during harvest time ; (c) by providing clothing keep the men at work in wet weather ; (d) maintain night work. A draft agreement with the Russian Government is appended to this Report.This or some alternative solution of the labour problem is immediately, necessary if the main means of importation into Russia is to&apos;be fully utilised this year.119. Of the total tonnage of goods available for Russia for 1917, 700,000 tons of coal will not have to be transported by rail at all to the interior, while perhaps 100,000 tons of goods will be transported inland by canal. This leaves 3,450,000 tons for the railways, of which 700,000 tons would be for Vladivostock, say, 350,000 for Romanov, and 2,400,000 tons for the Archangel railway or for the Murman railway from Kem. To this must be added 330,000 tons of material lying at Vladivostock and 270,000 at Archangel on 1st January, giving the following programme for the year: Vladivostock      - 1,030,000&quot;) Total, 4,000,000Archangel          -         -         -        - 2,320,000 /(including 600,000Kem       ----- 350,000 1 waiting transportRomanov -        -        -        -         - 350,000 J on 1st January).Archangel is the only line which has as yet managed anything like so large a programme as this. A considerable quantity of the goods for Vladivostock consists, however, of railway rolling stock and will assist the capacity of the line by carrying-other goods.120. Until Mr. Bury has reported, we are not in a position to comment further on this programme, but it may be remarked that it is considerably below the official capacity of the lines ; and if the latter figures are in any way justified, there should be a fair surplus of rolling stock to help to relieve the congestion in the interior of the country or at the front.CHAPTER VII. PROPOSED ALLOCATION.121. The preceding considerations suggest that the 4J million tons for which arrangements should be made may be allocated to the best advantage according to the following table. These figures exclude Swedish products imported from Finnish ports, and any additional assistance that may be rendered by Japan, as indicated in the following chapter.Artillery Department -Railway materialDemands.Shell steel      -      -      -      - ]Other iron and steel -Other metals    -      -      -      - ]Coal        -      -      -Motors    -      -Wire.....Other war material : Marine     ...Technical -Intendanoe       -Sauitary   -Archangel equipment        - 1 Mines and works under Com-merce Ministry      -      - j Ministries of Commerce and Agri-culture  -Koumania.....Tons. 4,190,000 2,458,000929,000 120,00012,929,000Proposed Supply.Tons. 1,200,000 700,000	(   100,000 )1,635,000	Nil	(   180.000 )1,750,000	1,500,000925,000	200,000320,000	110,000147,000	15,000 j77,000	40,000315,000	40,00015,000	15,000-   48,000	10,00010,000 J 120,0004,240,000Remarks.Of this, 370,000 represents rails and 330,000 tons wagons and locomotives, &amp;c., due for delivery on old orders.

The only orders for new supplies which it is suggested should be placed are for equipment for discharging the ships at Archangel, for tugs, and other material required by the Admiralty, and for harness, which it is thought can be obtained in the United States.123. If coal and artillery demands be deducted, the tonnage available for other items in 1917 is very much less than outstanding orders, and the problem of holding back supplies in order to facilitate the shipment of articles which are really urgent is one which will have to receive early and serious attention. Considerable monetary losses may be incurred in this connection, but this possibility may have to be faced in order to strengthen Russia&apos;s position by the supply of vitally important munitions. This situation is due to the fact that means of transportation have entirely failed to cope with the supplies which it was hoped could be brought into the country.124. The determination of priority is particularly serious in the case of machine tools, an enormous number of which have in the last two years been ordered for Russia, but less than half have been delivered.The Russian Government should be asked to allocate space to machinery, and to indicate which of the many outstanding orders should be permitted to go through in 1917. It is suggested that no more orders should in any circumstances be placed this year.CHAPTER VIII. ORDERS IN JAPAN.125. Russia has placed a considerable number of orders in Japan, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining credit there the total output capacity of Japan does not
appear to have been used to anything like its full extent. At an interview with the Japanese &quot;Military Attache it was stated that a number of orders are under considera-tion, but are being suspended.126. In view of the extreme difficulty of obtaining an adequate output of munitions it is very undesirable that the capacity of one of the members of the alliance should not be fully employed. The difficulty is, of course, to get Japans output to the western theatre, and it is, moreover, of extreme importance that at a time when Russia can only get into the country a very limited proportion of her require-in ents her orders in Japan should be selected with very great care, and in conjunction with the orders placed in England and America.127. The possibility of increasing Japans output of nitro-cellulose has already been referred to, and it is suggested that an official representation to the Government of Japan should be made in this matter. It is also suggested that Japan&apos;s steel output could be more usefully employed, though in this case the difficulty is transport from Vladivostock. It would seem desirable that enquiries should be made as to whether the shipping facilities of Japan are being fuily utilised, and if not, that the Japanese Governmeut should take in hand the service to Russia. The port capacity of Vladivostock is, however, greater than the railway capacity and probably one of the first and most useful ways in which Japan&apos;s steel industry could assist Russia would be for her to. supply rails which might be utilised to duplicate certain sections of the Siberian railway and provide additional track at junction points, &amp;c.It would also be necessary that Japan should do her utmost to increase the supply of rolling stock available at the eastern end of the Siberian railway. Japan&apos;s existing stock is unsuitable, as it is of a very narrow gauge. But her locomotive and wagon shops might be turned at once on to making 5-feet stock.If Japan undertook this task it would probably be convenient that her assistance should go through the port of Dalny, as this would have the double advantage of shortening the shipping journey, and, therefore, enabling the tonnage available to do more transport, and would also lessen the railway congestion at Vladivostock. It is true that the worst part of the transport difficulty is west of the junction with the Mauchurian railway, but the Siberian railway during the Russo-Japanese war carried far more traffic than could be imported through Dalny and Vladivostock. With organi-sation, with certain duplication of lines, and with adequate rolling stock, it should be possible greatly to increase importation from Eastern Asia.It would clearly be an advantageous bargain for the Japanese Government to do this, if the additional railway capacity which would thus be developed were taken up with orders in Japan.128. It is probably desirable, if this suggestion, be developed, that Great Britain should help financially and probably exercise some form of control, as in the case of orders placed in America.CHAPTER IX.-ORGANISATION.129. In the preceding chapters the various directions in which material assistance can be afforded to Russia have been discussed and certain recommendations made. In this work the Armaments Committee has obtained sufficient insight into the state of affairs, as regards the receipt and utilisation of material supplied&apos; from England, tc make it abundantly clear to them that, if full value is to be obtained for the con-siderable amount of material which we are providing, an adequate organisation must be established in Russia for the purpose.130. The British Mission at general headquarters and the Military Attache at Petrograd do all that is possible to assist in such matters, and have accomplished much. But these offi cers were selected to carry out quite other duties, and cannot have the technical knowledge required, for the work under discussion. Moreover, this has reached such proportions that it is a task in itself, quite beyond being dealt with as an adjunct to the ordinary duties of another department, further, the fact that different officers deal with the Stavka and wdth the. Ministry of War respectively renders it very difficult to preserve continuity, while in spite of all efforts to the contrary it must accentuate the unfortunate division of responsibility which exists in nussia. There can be no doubt that the position is now such as to demand a separate office-working, of course, under the Ambassador-and as regards the Stavka, throughd 3
the chief of the British Military Mission, to deal with all matters connected with the provision of munitions to Russia. It is proposed that this should he termed the &quot;Armaments Mission.&quot;131. This Mission vrould act as the link between England and Russia in all matters connected with munitions, being in touch with the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions on the one hand and with the Ministry of. War on the other. There is no doubt that the Russian Commission in London has not succeeded in filling such a place. Its personnel has not the knowledge required either of Russian requirements or of English conditions, and its disappearance would not be regretted in Russia.132. Broadly speaking, the duties of the Armaments Mission would be : (a) To act as advisers to the Russian Government as to requirements and thepossibility of supply ;(b) To keep the War Office and Ministry of Munitions at home informed both asto the strpply of munitions and materials in Russia ;(c) To watch over all munitions sent to Russia from the time of leaving Englanduntil they were in the hands of those for whom destined ; and further, \    (d) In the case of such articles as artillery, aeroplanes, &amp;c, to instruct the Russians in their use and see to their maintenance in the field.133. The Committee have been much struck by the large number of persons, usually wearing the uniform of British officers, who come to Russia on matters connected with munitions. In many cases these officers have little or no right to speak with any official authority, but they are accepted by the Russians and their advice freely taken. This has had many unfortunate results ; for instance, in the placing of orders for articles of British manufacture which have been tried by the British Army and found unsuitable for use in the field, naturally giving a very unfortunate impression. We have been astounded at the way the highest Russian officials have quoted as authoritative the pronouncements of such irresponsible individuals. The Military Attache has not the requisite technical knowledge to deal with such persons, but if an organisation such as is proposed were set up, all such would be referred there on arrival.134. The proposed Mission, being in touch with the munition situation at home, would be in a position not only to protect the Russians from such irresponsible persons but also to give them responsible advice on such matters, keeping them informed as to the success or otherwise of the trials of new inventions as well as on the situation of the Allies in respect to ammunition and raw materials and thus on the possibilities of supply. It would so be able to stop unreasonable demands at the source. At the same time, it would be able to keep the Ministry of Munitions informed as to the real urgency of demands which the Russian Commission in London cannot know owing to the want of co-ordination of departments in Russia. Being also in touch both with the French Mission and with British commercial residents in Russia, it would be able to keep the Ministry of Munitions equally, informed as to the productive possibilities in Russia, thus enabling demands to be properly criticised in England. ,135.* The next duty of the Mission would be to watch over the progress of all goods being supplied to Russia until they reached their destination. At present the position can only be described as chaotic. Shipping arrangements work badly and no one seems to know what is coming from England or America. Goods arrive unexpectedly, or not at all, and it is feared there may be leakage and important material lie unattended to. It may be only months afterwards that some casual remark discloses the fact that important components have not been received with a consignment, and then it seems impossible to find out whether they were shipped with the rest or whether they were sent on another ship, and, if so, whether that ship has ever arrived. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the railway journey in Russia. It would be the duty of the Mission to create the necessary organisation to enable them: (a) To keep the Russian authorities informed of the progress of manufacture andof shipment of all supplies promised ;(b) To check their arrival in Russian ports ;* This paragraph is based upon the situation we found in Russia and does not in any way refer to the movement or control of ships.
(c) To ensure their despatch from the ports without delay ;&apos;d) To check again their arrival at their destination and to ensure their being handed over in proper order and condition to the Russian authorities.136. Finally, there has to be considered the use of the material supplied. There is no doubt that as regards both artillery and aeroplanes, though their personnel is in some respects very good, the Russians are not in a position to make the most of the material supplied. Any direct action to improve matters in this respect would no doubt be resented, but it seems probable that if properly handled the provision of so much material of patterns which are new to the Russians should give the opportunity for rendering assistance. Since these guns, aeroplanes, &amp;c, are of our service patterns, it is obvious that we should superintend their being put into proper order after their long journey, the training of the Russian personnel in their use, and their maintenance in a serviceable condition in the field. The first training in the use of the new weapons can gradually be developed to include a grounding at any rate in the latest methods of combined work in the field, and this can be extended still further when the British officers visit their guns and aeroplanes at the front to see that they are being kept in proper order. With artillery and aeroplanes questions of equipment so vitally affect technical employment that such matters must go hand in hand.137. It will be clear from the above that the organisation set up should be under one head, who could, under the Ambassador, be responsible for dealing with the authorities both in England and in Russia on all questions connected with munitions supplied by England to Russia. Any division of authority would only add to the present difficulties. It is advisable that this officer should be familiar with the conduct of business at the War Office and Ministry of Munitions, as well as with the conditions in France, and he should be competent to give information as well as advice to the Russian authorities. There seems little doubt that the policy of secretiveness as to our own production and experiences which has hitherto been observed has rendered the task of our representatives here unnecessarily difficult.138. It would be necessary to have the following departments, the chief of the Mission being himself free to move as required to see the work of the several depart-ments and also to discuss matters with the Russian authorities at the Stavka and at the front: (a) A central office at Petrograd to deal with all matters connected with the supply of munitions, separate departments being established as found necessary for special matters such as metals, gas appliances, mechanical transports, &amp;c, &amp;c. All British subjects visiting Russia on matters connected with munitions would come under this officer, as far as their technical business was concerned, though officers would remain as heretofore under the Military Attache in all matters of discipline.(b) A transit department, which would be specially charged with the duty of watching the progress of all supplies from their shipment until their arrival at their destination. This would include representatives at the ports whose duties Avould be to check all receipts, take steps to prevent delay and loss at the ports and in transit to the shipping stations, and keep all concerned informed as to the progress.(c) Equipping stations where the material would be put together and the Russian personnel trained in its use. Three of these would be required : for heavy artillery, trench, mortars, and aeroplanes respectively. It would be desirable that they should be all combined at one place, but in any case they should be under a general officer with up-to-date experience of the latest developments in the combined work of guns and aeroplanes in the field. While this officer&apos;s duties will ostensibly be to superintend the work of equipping the batteries, &amp;c, his most important duties will lie in the training of the personnel, and especially, perhaps, in spreading a knowledge of the right &quot; doctrine &quot; during his visits to the battery at the front. To do this without suspicion of encroaching on the prerogatives of the Russian authorities, he will require great tact as well as thorough knowledge. Under him will be required regimental officers of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Flying Corps, thoroughly competent to instructo 4
in their special departments. There will also he required a small staff of mechanics under an experienced inspector of ordnance machinery.139. The interests to he entrusted to the proposed Mission are of great importance and complexity, and if it is considered advisable to do the work at ail, it should be done thoroughly the results of trying to carry on with insufficient organisation are apparent in the present position.In conclusion, it only remains to urge the absolute necessity of selecting thoroughly competent officers for the different appointments. To effect any good &quot;they must possess intimate knowledge of the work in the different Departments, and those entrusted with the training must be tactful besides possessing up-to-date knowledge of work in the field.JOHN HEADLAM.

The right bank has no railway service, and the wharfage only allows for the storage of 170,000 tons.   Thus 1,558,1)00 tons could not be unloaded into storage. The engineers therefore propose :  (1) The discharge by ferry-boats of 100 wagons a day, or 180,000 tons  although two of the ferries are still in England or America. (2) The organisation of extensive new   areas  several   kilometres distan t from the river and with-out practical communication with it, by which means the storage would be increased by 363,500 tons.The unloading capacity of the right bank is therefore computed at 713,500 tons.The unloading capacity of the left bank was then reconsidered. The daily tonnage per berth was reduced from 400 .to 300 tons, and, in order to increase the capacity, the alloca-tion of five coaling berths at Bakaritza to war material is being considered.Berths.

Even supposing that the ferry boats carry 25,000 tons, that the warehouse accommo-dation will be doubled, and that the barges will carry 49,000 tons to Kotlas, there will still remain 135,000 tons without accommo.latiou.These 135,000 tons may be provided for, and the figure of 1,329,000 may even be increased to 1,500,000 by assuming the gain of several days navigation, that the aaditional barges promised will allow of direct dis-cnarge in the river, or that export accommodation may in exceptional circumstances serve for import.To this figure must be added about a million tons of coal (1,000,000).Tons.From 1 Dec.

Archangel: As regards Archangel the following arrangements are proposed by the Russian officer in charge for dealing with the anticipated receipts in 1917 : Coal.-Total import, 1,450,000 tons. 500,000 tons of this will be unloaded at Kem by military labour and 950,000 tons at Archangel. Of the latter quantity 550,000 tons will be taken at Bakaritza and 293,000 at Economia, Moses Island, &amp;c. ; 67,000 tons will travel by canal to Petrograd and 40,000 by canal to Kotlas.General Cargo. The total to be discharged is 2,120,000 tons. This will be dealt with in the following way : Left Bank Tons.At Bakaritza       -      -      -      -      -      -      -      - 810,000At Bujervaiya     -------- 240,000By barges to be discharged at new shallow piers up theriver &apos; -      -      -      -     .-      -      -      - 290,000Total -     - 1,340,000Right Bank At Economy (6 berths) -      -      -     -     -     -     - 350,000At Smorny Buian -------- 230,000 .Elsewhere (possibly by canal to Kotlas)       -      - &apos;    - 200,000Total -     -     -    780,000Of the 810,000 tons to belauded at Bakaritza 480,000 tons can be carried during the season by train. 330,000 tons can easily be stored if sheds are completed. Of the 350,000 tons to.be landed at Economia 150,000 tons can be stored. The rest must cross by barge or ferry and 100 trucks will be required a day for this purpose. (This part of the programme will be the most difficult to carry out.)During the season 640 trucks a day will be required to take the general cargo and coal to be transported into the interior, viz., 1,320,000 tons.1,050,000 tons of general cargo and coal will have to be stored for the winter, which means that 465 trucks will be required daily to transport this after November 1st.This estimate, which is considerably in excess of the preceding figure, is con-sidered by our officers to be a very optimistic one and to have several weak points. They regard the general cargo capacity as nearer 1,400,000 tons than 2,100,000 tons.Vladivostock: We were not able to get any new information relating to Vladivostock or the Siberian railroad.Romanon: The following information was gathered relating to the Murman Railway when the Mission arrived in Russia : One munition train containing 120 tons of goods had passed over the line, while there were 20,000 tons afloat awaiting discharge. Warehouse capacity to a total of 4,900 tons had been allotted, and there was open storage accommodation for 40,000 tons. In addition to the small railway berth two berths were then complete. But we were given to understand that the railway was the limiting factor as, the material could not be got away from the port, nor were there sirfficient trucks to carry the goods from ships&apos; side to the storage grounds. There was not even sufficient labour to unload those trucks which had been taken up to the storage area and so release them for further use on the piers.During our stay at Petrograd it became evident that the Murman Railway would become of special importance in the campaign of 1917, and Lord Milner therefore
10,600 at 11 to 12 tons a car. - 120,000 tons.The unloading was expected to keep pace with this programme from 3^ berths in February, 41 berths in March, and 5^ berths in April.Up to the date when we lefc Russia, however, these anticipations had not been fulfilled, actual despatches by railway to February 7th (old style) being as follows : Date (US.).Jau. 2\, 7 10 12 14,, 15 16 17,, 1819 ,, 20 21Weight despatched.No. of WagonsTons.267173 160 188 202 49 209 184 356 184 10015 13 13 12 15 13 17 13 12 32 15 19Remarks.2 trains.Date(0.s.;.Jan. 22 ,, 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Feb. 1 2 34-75)55nWeight despatched.Tons. 149 210 205 211 409 170 174 194 236 194 184 7725,180No. of Wagons.16 15 16 14 28 16 18 15 26 14 17 63447Remarks2 trains.2 trains.From a total of 27 trains.o 2780held a conference on February 19th (new style) at which the following&quot; were present: Present.Ministry of Communication: M.

Goriachkopsky.   Chief Constructor of Murman Railway.War Department:  -  Major-General Vseroloshsky.   Chief of War Communication.Marine Ministry : Vice-Admiral Korvin.   Commander-in-Chief, Archangel.The information supplied at this conference was as follows : During January 39,500 tons arrived at Romanov ; of this, 24,200 tons was still afloat and 15,200 tons had been unloaded 9,000 at Romanov, 1,700 tons at Drovianoi, and 4,500 tons into icebreakers for Romanov.   Of the material unloaded at Romanov, 3,800 tons had been despatched by rail, and 5,200 tons was on shore, mostly in open, storage.The capacity of the railway from the 10th February to end of April (Russian style) was estimated at 120,000 tons.   This was expected to be carried as follows :  February 8th 28th    -    80 cars a day  -     -  1,600 cars. March -  135 - 4,050April -   165 ,.   - 4,950
Some of tfie causes of the difficulty are indicated in the following extract from Lord Milner&apos;s notes : &quot; The position which we found on arrival at Romanoff on February 25th was very different from what we had been led to hope from our interview at Petrograd. The tonnage hung up at Romanoff on that day amounted to about 55,000 tons, viz., 48,000 tons in ships and 7,000 tons, on shore. Some of the ships had been lying idle with goods on board for three or four weeks, a fearful waste of tonnage. The cause of this block was entirely the inability of the railway to remove the goods.&quot; The wharves are now capable of landing 1,500 tons a day, but the average which the railway is able to remove is only 200 tons, and unless there is a radical change in the management it seems difficult to hope that this will be materially increased, whereas it would need the removal of something like 1,000 tons a day to clear away the goods now at Romanoff and those on their way at sea, 10,000 tons, before the thaw sets in, when it is admitted by everybody that the line will be unuseable for some time. . .    .&quot; The principal cause of this failure is shortage of rolling stock, especially engines. I think myself that it is engines which are most at fault, for we saw a very large number of trucks on the lines as we came up immobilised at various points. One of the great reasons why engines are so short is that there are no adequate repair facilities at Romanoff (I am not sure that there are any elsewhere on the line), so that even a slight injury to an engine, which might be put right in a few hours, may immobilise it for weeks. We were told that as many as 55 engines were at present out of action.&quot; General Wilson sent an urgent telegram from Romanoff to the Minister of War at Petrograd, pointing out these facts. I also telegraphed in the same sense to Mr. Bury.   Both these messages went on the 25th.&quot;The Admiralty Transport Officer also takes a not very optimistic view of the situation, as the following cable to the Admiralty shows : The following telegram to General Herraonius begins : &quot; Three berths working at Romanoff. Also railway berth equalling one quarter - berth. Fourth berth will be ready end Russian February. Fifth berth, end of March Dravianoi will remain idle as no connection with railway and ice-breaker service being-ended. Discharging capacity of each berth under best conditions 360 tons per day. Up to now, however, average discharge per berth per day of 24 hours was under 200 tons.&quot; In view of the above it is quite impossible even under most favourable conditions to discharge at Romanoff wharves between Russian February 1st and May 1st more than 100,000 tons approximately, of which over 30,000 tons already in port, the discharge of which will occupy over 40 days if wagons at wharves provided.&quot;The serious obstacles wdiich delay discharging are insufficiency rolling stock and bad handling of same. For instance, the last three days the work at wharves has been reduced to an appalling extent owdng solely to lack of platforms, while I see at storage place about 100 loaded platforms of munitions idle and no attempt being made to discharge them. Work on shore mostly carried out by crippled soldiers who work carelessly and leisurely with hardly any supervision.&quot; There is practically no repairing workshop here and dozens of trucks remain idle for want of repair.&quot; At present, only one train of 15 wagons leaves Romanoff per day. If rolling-stock available, present state of railway would allow of three trains per day. In order to despatch by rail 100,000 tons before May 1st it is imperative that from February 20th 8 trains should leave here per day from March 1st, 9 trains per day from April 1st, 11 trains per day, this calculated on 15 wagons per train. Configuration of line only permits this quantity. To attain this, improvements of line junctions, water service, and all branches of management are necessary as well as sufficient rolling stock. For this reason I have started calculation from February 20th. Still, it is questionable whether these improvements can be effected in time to carry out the above programme before May 1st, further use of line after that date being very doubtful owdng to spring water, track not being consolidated in many places.&quot; There are seven warehouses for munitions, total capacity 2,500 tons, but are at present filled with naval base provisions.&quot; Open storage space is long and narrow of about 8,000 sagens square situated between buildings. Over&apos;6,000 tons munitions now lying in open storage, majority of which are explosives, powder included.    Fire  danger is evident, workmen&apos;s
barracks, kitchens, bakeries in close proximity; especially as large fires are kept ; in fact, several fires have already occurred in Romanoff.&quot; Should even an accidental fire occur in these workmen&apos;s quarters, Romanoff is doomed to be blown up.&quot; Only one floating crane of 45 tons capacity here; should it be damaged discharge of heavy weight wiU be delayed ; at present it is temporarily damaged.&quot; Transportation by rail of heavy artillery can be effected, provided some special arrangements are made. These have been arranged between transport officers and myself. More details for personal report. Leaving for Petrograd to-morrow, Thursday, &apos; Anrep &apos; ends.&quot;This officer and myself have had long consultations together, and I quite agree with his remarks and his figures.The Minster of Railways has undertaken to visit Romanoff with Mr. Bury, and at the meeting at Petrograd we were told that the Traffic Department of the Ministry of Railways was taking over the management of the line for the first time from the Construction Department; and this unity of management with the other Russian railway systems should enable considerable help to be furnished to Romanoff.The Minister of War was very anxious to press on with the clearing of the port, and has promised to send fresh and better quality labour ; it is therefore possible that General Poole, who has gone to Romanoff, will shortly be able to report a considerable improvement.As regards Kem, which will take in coal during the summer, the present situation is given in the further attached extract from Lord Milner&apos;s notes : &quot; On our return journey the Vice-Consul at Kem, Mr. Woodhouse, came to see me in the train on Friday, February 23rd, and we had a quarter of an hours conversation. He had been at Kem since August last; prior to that time there was no British consular officer there, nor indeed was there any trade. Kem was a place of 3,000 inhabitants before that, and its present importance is entirely due to the Murman Railway.&quot; The imports into Kem from abroad last year seem to have been entirely coal; 98,000 tons were imported last summer. Of these, oniy 26,000 tons had been moved, and that only since the beginning of. December. 72,000 tons are still lying in the snow at Kem, though he thought that that would not do the coal any harm.&quot; Mr. Woodhouse could not see any sign of the railway moving the coal more quickly than it had been doing, viz., about 8,000 tons a month. He told me that a much larger importation was expected this year. Last year there had been five berths. They were now busy constructing additional berths, intending to bring the number up to 12. There was an energetic engineer in charge, and he thought they would get this done. They reckoned on importing 500,000 tons this year, but Mr. Woodhouse was sceptical of the possibility of doing so. He would be surprised if they unloaded and removed more than half that quantity.&quot; I asked him as to the depth of water. He said that since the harbour had been dredged the depth was now quite adequate, and was &apos; as much as 28 feet at the quay side at low water, enough to take any collier. They would have to keep on dredging, but on this score he had no anxiety.&quot; The thing which seemed to trouble him most was that the place had no protection. He was afraid that a submarine might get there and would have no difficulty in destroying the piers and knocking the whole installation for landing goods to pieces. I asked him whether there was any protection for the harbour works and coal stacks on land. He said there were some guards, but he did not seem to feel very satisfied as to their adequacy. He told me confidentiaUy that an attempt had been made to set fire to the stacks recently, and a dynamite bomb had been discovered. He said that this was kept secret, but he was sure of the facts. He intended to report the want of protection to the Embassy.&quot;I told him that I would mention the fact to the Admiralty, but that he had better also let the Ambassador know.&quot;2780G
ANNEX 3.Draft Scheme for the Militarization of Labour at Archangel. Suggestions with regard to Imports into Russia for 1917.The experience of last year at Archangel renders it imperatively necessary to effect a radical change in the conditions of labour at that port.The urgent necessity of quick unloading and despatch on account of shortage of -tonnage accentuates the matter.A military organisation for this purpose seems the only possible and effective plan, and the inclosure puts forward this and some other matters intimately connected with discharge of steamers in White Sea ports.It is also thought that the chances of further explosions would be much reduced by the extension of military discipline in these ports.With regard to Munitions : 1. The Russian Government undertake to provide a military organisation of active service Army to deal with all munitions from rail of ship to ultimate deposit in railway waggons.The organisation to be officered by active service officers and to be under the immediate command of a Russian military officer of rank, who will be directly responsible to the Vice-Admiral commanding for the due performance of the work.A British officer from the Naval Transport Department to be attached to the Commanding Officer of the organisation.The organisation will also undertake the duties of military police for all munitions discharging points, provide sentries for all ships and barges having explosives on board, and generally regulate the work under the conditions of strict military discipline of an army in the field in war time. .The organisation to be furnished with an adequate supply of horses and suitable carts.Where difficulty is found in requisitioning the necessary horses and carts locally, these are to be supplemented as necessary from military resources.The organisation to be of sufficient strength to continue work by day and night, and to deal with 600 tons daily from each ship discharging.A aetachment of 300 Russian seamen from Imperial Navy or its Reserves to be attached to organisation.The duties of these will be to assist with heavy lifts, berthing ships, renewing strops and discharging appliances, &amp;c.This number to be reasonably increased or diminished, as experience requires.The organisation to be employed solely for work-in connection with general cargo,1 which will be kept apart and distinct from coal.The organisation to be fitted with suitable wet weather clothing.The same to be served out to stevedores employed at their own cost. ;2. General cargo work to be independent of public holidays, and steps to be taken by Russian Government to prevent depletion of stevedores during harvest time.3. Customs&apos; tallying staff to be increased to obviate all delays in this respect.Increase to be on the basis of 600 tons a day from every ship discharging.4. With reference to the above arrangements, the organisation will handle all cargo discharged at any of the munitions discharging points, irrespective of the nature of the goods or whether they are consigned to firms, Ministries or Government departments.Coal.i (a) The due performance of the stevedoring work to be under the supervision of the British Naval Transport Department, both at Archangel and Kem.(6) The Russian Government to guarantee the supply to the stevedoring contractors of the requisite labour, should it be required.The amount of such labour to be based on an estimate of at least 200 per ship for each ship discharging.These may be either active service men or reserve men, but they must be capable of heavy work.(c) Suitable accommodation for all labourers to be provided.
(d) The Russian Government to undertake the rationing of all labourers supplied by them, and to make suitable arrangements for the purchase by private labour of suitable provisions.(e) Arrangements to be made by Russian Government for the supply of wet weather clothing for all labourers, in order that work may proceed irrespective of weather.(/) Arrangements with regard to harvest and holidays to be similar to those made for general cargo.\g) The Russian Government to put in hand at once the necessary arrangements for the construction of baskets and wheelbarrows, and for the supply of the necessary shovels, cordage, timber and nails.The supply of all these necessaries to be adequate to the needs of the whole season, allowing for wastage.These appliances to be sold or hired to the various stevedoring firms at cost price.(h) The bunkering of steamers to be carried out by the stevedoring firms under tbe supervision of the British Naval Department.General.(1) The Russian Government undertakes the efficient lighting of all the ships&apos; holds, wharves, barges, and store houses, where special arrangements are necessary.(2) Efficient telephone communication to be provided between Archangel, Bakaritza, and other points where cargo is being discharged.(3) The telephone system to be accessible to all engaged in transport work. .(4) The first entry of ships into Archangel depends on matters outside human control. It is, however, necessary that labour should be ready and on the spot, and wages paid ready for an early opening of navigation.All contractors to be indemnified against loss on this account. The definite date on which such indemnity ceases to be fixed by the Vice-Admiral Commanding.(5) All tugs to be requisitioned by Russian Government except British Govern-ment tugs.(6) The whole work of the port, so far as it is affected by ths above agreement, shall be under the general control of the Vice-Admiral Commanding, who will have a deciding voice as questions arise.
