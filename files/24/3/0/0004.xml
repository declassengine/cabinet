Printed for the War Cabinet   January 1917.G.-104.NOTE ON THE POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF COAL FOR FRANCE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.- THE French Government have seat M. Her riot, the new Minister of Transportation, to London to make the most urgent representations to the British Government on the subject of the want of coal in France, more especially for the munition factories. M. Herriot has stated that the urgency is so great that unless increased quantities of coal can be despatched to France immediately certain of these munition factories will have to close down. The quantities of- coal exported from this country to France during the last four months have been gradually decreasing, as the following figures will show : .   September 1916 October      ,, November   ,, December    ,,Total      ...        ......      6,653,000Tons. 1,850,000 1,S43,000 1,510,000 1,450,000The monthly quantities of coal required in France as for the past year have been stated to be 2,000,000 tons, consequently the above figures show that at the present moment there is a shortage of 1,350,000 tons on the last four months.The main reasons for the falling off in the exports of coal to France are : (a.) The necessary action of the Admiralty in delaying the departure of ships from British ports due to the presence of German submarines.It is understood that negotiations are at the present moment being carried on between the British and French Admiralties with a view to reducing as far as possible the necessity for this detention.(o.) The reduction of the number of neutral vessels ordinarily employed in the French coal service.M. Herriot has seen the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Shipping Controller, who, it is understood, explained to him that without the sanction of the Cabinet it would be impossible to allocate any further British tonnage to the French coai service.M. Herriot was informed that a further drastic reduction of imports would have to be made in the case of the United Kingdom owing to shortage of tonnage, and that a scheme was now being worked out. He asked to be supplied with full information as soon as the scheme was settled, and promised that France would act on similar lines.With regard to neutral tonnage a scheme has been under the consideration of the Board of Trade, and of the Departments of the French and Italian Governments concerned for the control and chartering of all neutral vessels available, which will ensure their employment in the services in which they are most needed. The necessity of putting this scheme into operation with the least possible delay was urged upon M. Herriot, who agreed that so far as the French Government is concerned the necessary arrangements will be made in order to enable the scheme to come into force by the 12th instant. In this connection M Herriot has been informed by the President of the Board of Trade that, so far as can be seen, it might be possible, at any rate for the first month, to allocate to the French Government 50 per cent, of the neutral tonnage obtained on time-charter.
With, a view to relieving the immediate situation, it has been arranged that a number of vessels which have been held up in British ports, owing to their having been chartered at rates in excess of those fixed under the Limitation of Freight Scheme, shall be released for the service of the French Government, who will allocate them at their own discretion. It is estimated, however, that this measure will provide France with not more than from 100,000 to 120,000 tons, and consequently further assistance is urgently required. In these circumstances it is for the Cabinet to decide whether the Admiralty should consider the possibility of diverting coal cargoes to French ports in order to relieve the immediate situation.M. Herriot explained that the French authorities were taking, and would take, every possible measure to prevent their ports being congested. One of the measures was the development of their inland water transport, but there was a scarcity of river tugs, and he asked that the Admiralty would allow them to purchase some river tugs in this countryA.
