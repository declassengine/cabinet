[TMs Dosnmssrt is the ^gjgjg^lJ^Sri^^P^ Majesty^ GownmenjJPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1917.SECRET.32-    THE GREEK QUESTION.Note by. Lord Milner.SIR F. ELLIOT and Brigadier-General Fairholme were slaying on in Rome to await the result of the ultimatum to King Constantine, and I had a good deal of talk with both of them about the future. Assuming that the King accepts the ultimatum, Elliot thinks the greatest difficulty in working it will arise over the re-establishment of the Controls, especially the French Control over Police and Telegraphs, which, he says, in the past was both inefficient and vexatious.I am convinced that both Fairholme and Elliot will do their very best to make the arrangement with Constantine work, if there is an arrangement, though they are  as we all must be doubtful whether it will not break down over details. It is evident to me that it will have a much better chance of working if new men could be sent to replace the several Ministers and military attaches who have been engaged in putting the screw on Constantine during the past few months. New men would have a much better chance of carrying out the neAv policy, and I think both Elliot and Fairholme would welcome the change, and not regard it as any censure upon themselves which, indeed, it would not be.I also saw M. Alexandris, one of Venizelos&apos;s &quot;Ministers,&quot; who has been sent to Rome to remove misconceptions as to Venizelos&apos;s policy in Italy. Italian Ministers, I understand, are prepared to receive him and hear what he has to say, but not to recognise him officially. He was, of course, not best pleased to hear that King Constantine was to have another chance, though he was fairly reasonable about it. I did my best to explain our present policy, which, of course, is not easy. He said he hoped it did not mean that we were going to abandon Venizelos. I assured him very emphatically that we should certainly not do that, and that, within the territory now in his possession, and in his efforts against the common enemy (Bulgarian and Turk), he would certainly have all the support which His&quot; Majesty&apos;s Government could give him, and that he was assured of the sympathy of the British people.(Initialled)      M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 16, 1917.
