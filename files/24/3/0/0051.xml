[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET.G.-145. f -    ^EFFECT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WAR FROM NAVAL ASPECT.Memorandum by the Admiralty War Staff.(Note. In the following remarks it is assumed that the countries referred to become neutral and not hostile.)I. Italy.IN this case the Austrians would have command of the Adriatic, but the French first fleet at Corfu ^should be capable of preventing them from undertaking any operations outside that area.The Austrian fleet of thirteen battleships (including three 2nd class) carry 60  12-inch and 53-9&apos;4-inch guns in their primary armament.The French first and second squadrons of twelve Dreadnoughts carry 30  13&quot;4-inch, 68- 12-inch,. and 60 9&apos;4-inch, and are therefore greatly superior in gun power if not in numbers. Their third squadron, consisting of five Patries, is stationed at Salamis while the blockade of Greece continues. When that is raised two of these are to join the &quot; Lord Nelson &quot; and &quot;Agamemnon &quot; in the -ZEgean. If the remainder rejoin the first fleet, the French would then have superiority in numbers. It would not therefore be necessary to send more capital ships to the Mediterranean, though the French might perhaps ask for them ; some of the King Edward class would be available. We should still have to maintain the Otranto barrage, which would be little affected. The base would have to be shifted to Corfu, and consequently a few more A. P. vessels might be required. The Italians now do little or nothing to support the barrage, so that conditions would be much as they are now, and it might even be an advantage to have it entirely in our own hands. The monitors and submarines now at Venice would become available for its support.Outside the Adriatic, patrol vessels would be required for the two zones for which Italy is now responsible, but by redistribution of the existing French and British patrols this could probably be done without much increase in the numbers.Outside the Mediterranean, the withdrawal of Italy would have little or no effect on naval operations. With regard to shipping, we should gain the tonnage now allocated for supplying Italy.We should cease to supply naval ammunition, torpedoes, and stores.A certain amount of leakage of supplies to Germany would take place through Italy, and additional boarding-vessels would be required at Gibraltar.IL Russia.The principal effect of the withdrawal of Russia would depend on the amount of importance attached to communication with Romanoff and Archangel. With the cessation of imports of munitions in Russia, the Germans would probably stop their submarine campaign in the north unless it was necessary for us to draw much in the way of food supplies and timber from that region. We should not have any bases for auxiliary patrols in those waters, which would probably entail the-escort of all vessels with valuable cargoes coming from thence.The Germans would have, complete command of the Baltic, and the British submarines if unable to get out would have to be interned.The Turkish Fleet, including the German ships and submarines, would be freed from the Black Sea for work in the Mediterranean if they could pass the Dardanelles entrance. .[487]
The large amount of shipping now used for carrying munitions to Russia would be freed for other purposes.With Russia neutral, Germany would be able to obtain food and other supplies from Russia, and could also utilise Russian manufacturing resources and raw material for munitions, &amp;c.Horses for transport could be obtained, and Russian labour attracted to Germany to set free men for the Army.The blockade would, therefore, in a great measure lose its effect, and the Navy consequently be prevented from throwing its full weight into the scale.Beyond these matters, the naval situation would not be affected.III. France.This would naturally be the most serious case, and, generally speaking, the situation created would be one of very great embarrassment, and would be an exceedingly heavy tax on our resources.In the North Sea and home waters the effect would not be great, but an increase in the number of auxiliary patrol vessels and destroyers in the Channel and approaches would be required. The extent to which it would be necessary to intercept vessels bound to French ports in the Channel and Bay of Biscay with foodstuffs and contraband destined for Germany would be the main factor, and it might be found necessary to provide squadrons of cruisers and armed merchant cruisers for this purpose. Vessels bound to Mediterranean ports could be dealt with in the Straits of Gibraltar and Suez Canal.   Additional boarding steamers would be required at Gibraltar.Germany would be able to make use of French territorial waters, and her merchant ships would thus be able to pass between Germany and the Straits of Gibraltar, and obtain food and supplies from France and Spain.In the Mediterranean, unless we are prepared to relinquish the command to Austria, which, in view of our interests in Egypt and control of the trade routes, seems out of the question, it would be necessary to provide a force to neutralise the Austrian Fleet.The four Austrian Dreadnoughts, and the fast Radetsky class, would be too powerful to be contained by any pre-Dreadnought squadron we could supply, and we should have to detach six Dreadnoughts from the Grand Fleet, with a light cruiser squadron and two modern destroyer flotillas, besides increasing the submarine force in the Mediterranean.We should lose the assistance the French give us in the West Indies and Atlantic.Germany would get supplies from France, which would greatly reduce the effect of our blockade, as in the case of Russia.On the other hand, we should be freed from the heavy tax of maintaining immense armies overseas, and could devote all our tonnage to naval purposes and the supply of necessaries.IV. Japan.The effect of Japan:s withdrawal would not be very serious. They are at present assisting us with cruisers in the Malay Archipelago and Indian Ocean, and with destroyers in the Mediterranean. They are of little assistance, however, in the examination of merchant vessels for enemy subjects, and seditious literature for India, and the work now falls on our own vessels. They are responsible for operations in the China Seas, but the only likely ones now are against raiders. Four or five more cruisers on the China Station would be necessary if Japan could be thoroughly trusted.   If not, it would be necessary to have a powerful squadron on this station.Admiralty War Staff, April 3, 1917.
