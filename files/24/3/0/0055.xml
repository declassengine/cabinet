^^Jg^ff^LJi-^jfropertyiof His Britannic Majesty^ Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1917.SECRET.G-149.MACHINERY EOR DISTRIBUTION AND RATIONING OE EOOD.Memorandum by Food Controller for Submission to War Cabinet.(Previous Paper No. G-148.)THE proposals contained in my memorandum of the 2nd May (G-148) for setting up the machinery of compulsory rationing have been the subject of further consideration at meetings attended by Lord Milner, Mr. Arthur Henderson, Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, Professor Adams, and representatives of the Ministry of Food.At the time when these proposals were formulated, a full examination of the problem of compulsory rationing of sugar had been made by a Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Alfred Butt, containing as its other members Sir Horace Monro, K.C.B., Mr. Stephen Walsh, M.P., Mr. Chantrey, Mr. Cullen, Mr. H. J. May, Mr. Peters, Mrs. Pember Reeves, and Captain Tallents. This Committee recommended the adoption of the scheme of-rationing by tickets, which was briefly indicated in the &quot; Preliminary note for the guidance of Food Commissioners&quot; set out in the memo-ranclum of the 2nd May. The recommendations of this Committee were reviewed by another Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Kennedy Jones, and including Sir Horace Monro, Mr. Butt, Mr. Beveridge, Captain Tallents, and Mrs. Pember Reeves, which substantially endorsed them, and added certain proposals in regard to the rationing of bread and flour.Since the report of the last-named Committee was received, the situation has altered, in so far as there is now no reason to anticipate a shortage of supplies sufficient to necessitate the rationing of breadstuffs before the harvest.I am of opinion, nevertheless, that it is necessary to take immediate practical steps both to correct the present unequal distribution of sugar and to set up the local machinery which would be essential in case compulsory rationing of the essential foodstuffs was ever required, but which, quite apart from that necessity, would provide a solid and much-needed foundation for controlling their distribution. I submit, accordingly, for approval, the revised proposals contained in Part I of the attached memorandum.In framing these proposals special attention has been given to the necessity of avoiding any action which might interfere with the voluntary campaign upon which it is proposed to rely for any reduction of consumption before the harvest. I have also had regard to the importance of taking precautions against local food shortages, and of decentralising so far as possible the executive work of the Ministry of Food.If for any reason the proposals which I now put forward in Part I are not adopted, I recommend the course of action suggested in Part II.Part I.Appointment of Local Food Committees.The local authority for each district should be asked to appoint immediately a Food Committee with the following duties : 1. To set up a local Food Office and secure the services of an executive officer.2. To put into force a scheme for the redistribution of the sugar supplies, and in doing so to obtain a return as to the population of the district.[639] B
3. To register the retailers of bread and flour (and of any other articles that may be specified) in the district, and to obtain from them returns as to consumption.4. To assist the Ministry of Food in the enforcement of Orders. 5. To undertake such other work as may be entrusted to them by the Pood Controller.The local authorities for this purpose would be as follows :-England and Wales : In London the City Corporation and Metropolitan Borough Councils : elsewhere the Municipal Borough Councils and Urban and Rural District Councils.Scotland: In counties (excluding Royal, Parliamentary, and police burghs) the County Council, with power to divide the county into such districts as they may determine. In Royal, Parliamentary, and police burghs, the Town Council: provided that if the County Council and the Town Council of any burgh so agree, the burgh may be administered as part of the county.The form in which the scheme should be applied to Ireland is under consideration by the Chief Secretary.Eor the purpose of supervising and assisting the work of the local Food Committees, Divisional Food Officers would need to be appointed by the Ministry of Food.The draft letters and statements for issue to local authorities contained in the Memorandum of the 2nd May, would be altered to suit the proposals now submitted.The following paragraphs deal more fully with the principal points in the proposals: -Scheme for Sugar Distribution.Two alternative schemes for a more equitable distribution of sugar supplies are submitted for the consideration of the War Cabinet. The first involves the use of individual sugar tickets, and gives much greater certainty of securing to each individual his proper supplies. &apos;  &apos;Scheme (A).-Every householder will be required to fill up an application form (obainable from the Post Office) giving the name, age, sex, and occupation of each member of the household aud to forward it to the Local Food Office.The Food Office will in return send to the householder a card for each individual in the household, with detachable tickets. The card will have to be produced whenever a purchase of sugar is. made, and a corresponding ticket or tickets will be detached by the retailer. The retailer will send the tickets collected by him to the Food Office and will receive in exchange a voucher enabling him to purchase the necessary supplies of sugar.to meet his normal demands and maintain a small reserve for fluctuations. The grocer will thus be kept supplied on the basis of his actual sales and each individual will get his fair share.It will not be necessary for a householder to be tied to one particular retailer. On the other band, it will be illegal to buy or sell sugar without the presentation of a card and the detaching of a ticket.Scheme (B). This is the same as Scheme (A) up to the point of the sending in of an application form to the Food Office. The Food Office, in place of returning to the householder individual cards with detachable tickets, will send a certificate showing the number of rations of sugar to which the household is entitled.The householder will lodge the certificate with the retailer through whom he wishes to get his supplies and will thus become a &quot; registered customer.&quot; The retailer will send to the Food Office a return of the certificates lodged with him and will receive in exchange a voucher enabling him to purchase the necessary supplies of sugar. This will bring the distribution of sugar to each district in accord with the needs of its ascertained population.The retailer will be required to sell sugar as nearly as possible in accordance with the certificates lodged with him. Though it will not be absolutely illegal for the retailer to sell to other than registered customers, or, conversely, for a householder to buy sugar wherever he can get it, the retailer must sdve preference to his registered customers over others. This should enable each individual to get approximately his proper supplies.
It will be necessary under either scheme to make special arrangements for fixing the supplies to hotels, manufacturers, and others. It will also be necessary to register all the retailers of sugar and to obtain from them returns as to sales, stocks, and so forth.Returns of Population and Consumption.Under either of the foregoing schemes, the local Pood Committee from the applications received, will be able to obtain a full return of the population of the district, classified by age, sex, and occupation.At the same time they will ascertain the actual consumption of bread and flour in the district by requiring all retailers to register at the local Pood Office and to furnish returns as to supplies and sales. Similar returns could be obtained for other articles as required. .These two sets of returns will enable the proper quota of supplies of bread and flour to each district to be determined, having regard to the population and its needs. If and when it becomes necessary to bring the distribution of bread and flour to the localities under control, this can be done : (a.) By requiring wholesalers and others to supply retailers, only (or preferentially)on warrants issued by the Pood Committee; (b.) By authorising the Pood Committee of each district to issue warrants toretailers up to the quota of supplies fixed for the district as a whole.By this means distribution would be kept in the ordinary channels of trade, but would be controlled in such a way as to secure to each district its fair share of supplies.It is not, indeed, proposed that the distribution of any article, except sugar &quot;(which will be regulated by one of the schemes described above), should now be brought under control. Immediate action in regard to bread and flour will be limited to obtaining returns of consumption. The returns of population, however, and of consumption of bread and flour can be obtained with relatively little-trouble and should be obtained at once. They, form the indispensable basis of any systematic distribution of bread and flour to districts and within each district. Unless this preliminary survey has been made, it will be impossible to deal promptly with any emergencv.Similarly a census of consumption of any other article in each district could be made, and its distribution could thereupon be regulated as in the case of flour.A mere census of the population could, of course, be made under direct compulsory powers, apart from the sugar distribution scheme. This, however, would probably be more costly (since under the plan proposed above registration will be enforced automatically by desire to obtain sugar) and would of course do nothing to improve the distribution of sugar.The following is an illustration of the power that would exist to deal with emergencies if these proposals are adopted. If it became necessary to reduce suddenly the supplies of bread and flour or of any other article whose consumption had been ascertained, the reduction could be carried out evenly as between different districts, by altering the district quotas. The Pood Committee of each district could in turn distribute the reduction evenly among the different retailers, and the retailers could be required to keep a card index or register of their regular customers and make a proportionate reduction in the supplies to each.Other Duties of Food Committees.Certain duties in connection with the enforcement of Orders have already been imposed on local authorities. These duties would presumably be exercised in future through the Pood Committees. In any case the appointment of the Committees would clearly lead to much greater attention being given&quot;locally to the question of enforcement.Conclusion.It may be claimed for the foregoing proposals : That they will substantially correct the present unequal distribution of sugar. 2. That they will furnish a complete census of the population, and so provide the [639] B 2
basis for a proper distribution of any other article to the various localities, making impossible to prevent the repetition in other fields of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to sugar.3. That they will prepare the way for compulsory rationing of all or any of the essential foodstuffs, should that become necessary, without in any way committina&apos; the Government to the introduction of such a scheme or interfering with present voluntary efforts.4. That they will materially assist enforcement of Orders.5. That they will set up local Food Committees, with duties sufficiently definite and responsible to attract and retain representatives of standing, who will then be available to take on fresh duties as required.It is very difficult to frame any precise estimate of the administrative expenditure involved in the foregoing proposals, but it should not exceed 275,000/. if Scheme (A) is adopted for sugar distribution, or 200,000/. if Scheme - (B) is adopted. Material savings on these amounts might be made if sufficient voluntary assistance was forth-coming. The staff required is estimated at 5,000 regularly and 20,000 for temporary work during the actual receipt of applications and issue of cards under Scheme (A). The corresponding figures, if Scheme (B) was adopted, are 3,000 and 15,000. These figures are for the United Kingdom as a whole. They are, in each case, exclusive of the actual membership of the Food Committees.The estimated expenditure would be incurred in the first four months. Thereafter the expenditure would naturally depend entirely upon what work was imposed on the Food Committees.Part II.It is possible that objection may be raised to the foregoing proposals, on two grounds: 1. That it is undesirable to adopt in this country, at the present time, anythingwhich could be described as compulsory rationing, since this would giveundue encouragement to the enemy. 2. That the setting up of official local machinery for dealing with food questionswill interfere with the success of the voluntary campaign for foodeconomv.The first point is one upon which it is naturally not easy for me to express an opinion. It may, however, be pointed out that the proposals set out above (in particular Scheme (B)) do not really amount to compulsory rationing, and avoid even the appearance of rationing as completely as is possible without sacrificing the object of securing a better distribution of sugar. Moreover, they deal not with an essential foodstuff, but with a subsidiary article whose grave shortage in this country has long been as well known to the enemy as well as to ourselves.As regards the second point, it may be admitted that there would be risk of interference with the voluntary campaign if Food Committees of the local authorities were established for general purposes throughout the country, or were established without their being given sufficient specific duties.The actual proposals which I have made, however, impose upon the local Food Committees quite definite duties, which would occupy the whole of their energy for some considerable time.   They do not therefore, in my opinion, involve this danger.Assuming, however, that for either or both of the above reasons, or for any other reason, the .proposals made above are not approved by the War Cabinet, I am of opinion that it would be premature and unwise to set up any comprehensive local organisation for dealing with food, or to encourage local authorities to appoint Food Committees. It would be harmful to have this organisation established before there is definite work for it to do. On this assumption I would suggest limiting present action to the following : &apos;1. A census of consumption of bread and flour, sugar, and possibly two or three other articles to be taken by the Ministry of FoOd, using the local authorities in the first instance to distribute and possibly to collect the forms, but itself undertaking the tabulation and statistical work either at one centre or in a limited number of divisional centres. This census, . which might be repeated subsequently if necessary, would give invaluable material for the general control of food supplies.
o2. A fresh population census in a simple form should be taken. I believe that this is needed for a large number of purposes distinct from those of the Ministry of Food. It might be taken through the ordinary census machinery.3. The Ministry of Food should, if this appears necessary, establish divisional food offices for general purposes in connection with its administration. The country would be divided into a limited number of districts (say twenty or thirty) for this purpose.The foregoing proposals just made are not as satisfactory from the point of view of Food Control as those in Part I of this memorandum. They do not correct the wrong distribution of sugar, and they do not prepare in advance any appreciable part of the machinery that would be required for compulsory rationing. They would, however, supply some of the information indispensable for controlling food supplies, should the necessity arise later. If the information is not obtained now, we shall be in so much worse position for dealing with any emergency when it comes.DEVON PORT.Ministry of Food,May 28, 1917.
