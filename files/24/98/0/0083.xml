- a -desire to shew the world that the principles that we apply to otherpeoples are those we accept for ourselves, and thus to diminish thechronic nuisance which Irish agitation produces throughout theEnglish-speaking world, this is no small gain.a.   If you have a Hihern i a Irrend er t a within tho province ofUlster, you will greatly add to the difficulties of the UlsterParliament;   ybu will reproduce on &amp; small fecal e all the troubleswhich We have had at Westminster during the forty years between1 theadvent Of Parnell on the political stage in 1878, and the blessedrefusal of the Sinn Peiners to take the oath of allegiance in 1918.;and you will throw Upon the Executive at Belfast the sameembarrassments from which the Executive in Dublin is now suffering.If this, or anything like this., happens, there will be noIrish settlement.     Whereas,, if you carry out logically theprinciple of self-determination., you need fear no effective agitationeither outside Great Britain or in Ireland for re-uniting the twofragments of the Island which your Home Rule Bill divides.   Any&amp;Ossfc$nent oh behalf of the south and west to force the nor-wh-eastinto an unnatural unification will be without excuse,&apos; and will appearto be-, what it really is., a mere struggle for domination.One further observation on a different point..   I hope in thefinancial arrangements with Ireland wo shall not be absurdly lavish.I have not the least desire to be Vindictive, and I would treat therebels over money matters as one gentleman treats another in a matter,of pure business-.   But I would neither give them more money than theyare entitled to, on the wholly false ground that &quot;they have been un-generously treated in the past., nor would 1 overpay them on theprinciple Which induces a man &quot;to give a large sum to an organ-grinder&quot;in ord&amp;fc to induce him to play his too familiar tunes in somebodyOloo&apos;s street rather than in his own&apos;!   I. would pay neither consciencemoney nor black-mail.
I should not have troubled you with this letter had Inot rather gathered that the Cabinet opinion was turningagainst the small Ulster, as defined in the Bill, to thelarge Ulster, which is, after all, no more than ageographical expression, with no real history behind it..Yours ever,,   -&apos; (Signed)   ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR,.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W..1..19th-February, 1920.
