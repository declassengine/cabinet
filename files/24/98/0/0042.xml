[Tkis Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.![February 5.]Section 1,[174632] No. 1.Memorandum respecting Egyptian Cotton Control Scheme.THE President of the Board of Trade, in his Memorandum No. CP. 497 of the23rd January, briefly describes the recommendations of the Empire Cotton-GrowingCommittee and raises-the question of how this body is to be financed in the future.He proposes, in agreement with the Treasury, that a portion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernments share in the profits arising out of the Egyptian Cotton Control Schemeshould be devoted to this purpose.The Foreign Office, on the other hand, have supported Lord Allenby&apos;s contentionthat it would be highly inexpedient for His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist on theirclaim to any portion of these profits, amounting to about 4,000,0001.Sir A. Geddes adduces four arguments in favour of his view, which may besummarised as follows in order of importance : 1. The scheme was jointly guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and theEgyptian Government, and as His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared, tobear half the loss they are in equity entitled to half the^profits. .2. It is unfair to say that the profit was earned at the expense of the Egyptiangrowers who were guaranteed a fair price throughout the period of control.3. Egyptian growers were protected from a possible slump in the market.4. The success of the scheme was due in a large measure to the voluntary andunpaid work of members of the Egyptian Official Values Committee in thiscountry.To deal with these arguments in order. The first is based on grounds of equityand cannot theoretically be disputed. At the same time there are certain considerationswhich detract from its force. For instance, it must be remembered that in point of factHis Majesty:s Government did not have to advance a single penny towards financingthe scheme, and further, though they agreed to bear half the loss, the division ofprofits was specifically reserved for subsequent negotiation between the twoGovernments.But it is on grounds of political expediency rather than of equity that the questionmust in reality be judged. All classes of Egyptian opinion are profoundly convincedthat the profits were made at the expense of the Egyptian growers, and any insistenceon our pound of flesh would inevitably be regarded by them as but the first steptowards the economic exploitation of Egypt in favour of this country. Such animpression could only have a disastrous effect on the prospects of the settlement whichLord Milners Mission is endeavouring to promote in the teeth of extremist opposition;on the other hand, a solution of the Egyptian political problem, if this be feasible,would be cheaply effected at the cost of 2,000,000L, particularly as this involves nocharge upon the Treasury but only the waiving of a claim to a financial windfall.The second argument is scarcely susceptible of exact proof; but the accompanyingdiagram, based on the Liverpool Cotton Market reports in the &quot; Times;&quot; shows that thesale of controlled Egyptian cotton was most active when the price of American washigh and, owing to its fixed price, Egyptian cotton was relatively cheap, and similarlythat the sales of Egyptian decreased in volume with the fall in the price of Americancotton. From this we are forced to the conclusion that the British consumers were ableto arrange their purchases so as to take advantage of a favourable state of the market,and consequently the profit under consideration can scarcely have come out of theirpocket. Yet a further indication that Egyptian cotton was sold below its true marketvalue is provided by the fact that directly the control was removed at the end of July 1919the price in Alexandria advanced from the controlled figure of 42 dollars to 60 dollars,a movement which was naturally reflected in Liverpool, as the diagram shows. Theconclusion, therefore, is that the profits were in fact earned at the expense of theEgyptian growers.[2217 e-1]
The third argument is indisputable; but as the contingency of a serious slump inthe market did not arise, the value of the fixed price to the Egyptian growers ishypothetical.Finally, there is the fourth argument, which relies on the voluntary servicesrendered by the members of the Egyptian Official Values Committee in this country.These services were undoubtedly great, but it is open to question whether they weremore valuable than those rendered by the Control Board in Egypt and their skilledclassifiers throughout the period of control.In conclusion, it is necessary to emphasise the grave consequences which will almostinevitably follow on a rigid insistence on the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government in thismatter. The views of Lord Allenby upon it have been strongly and more than onceexpressed.   I shrink from the responsibility of overruling them.C. of K.Foreign Office,February 5, 1920.
