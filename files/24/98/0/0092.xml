Delegation versus Representation.In several recent instances the rank and file have shown an inclination to challengeand over-rule the authority of their leaders. The most important of course were thedisputes in the foundries and on the railways. In the case of the moulders, as in that ofthe railwaymen. the leaders arrived at settlements which their followers threatened torepudiate.All these movements are signs of the increasing prominence which is being given tothe question of the status of labour leaders--whether they should be delegates merelyexpressing the will of their followers or representatives chosen by their followers to guideand lead them. The question is one of fundamental importance. The increasing sizeof labour organisations has involved centralised control and the elaboration of a centralpolicy, and has inevitably separated the leaders from the rank and file. Observers havelong noted that organised labour must one day choose between the representative andthe delegate system. But that day has now come. The attention of labour is beingfocussed upon it explicitly, and that it presents an awkward problem for the labour leaderis shown by an examination of Mr. Hodges&apos; recent pamphlet on &quot; Workers&apos; Control in theMining Industry.&quot; . . . (the manager) &quot; would be the elected, the delegated representativeof the workers under their executive control. He would have the same sanctions, the sameauthority, which the Trade Union Official lias to-day; the responsibility and theauthority of the delegated person.&quot; . And again, &quot; The old willingness to delegate must.(C 1966)   150  2,20  H &amp; S M
be expected to manifest itself under this scheme, but it will gradually disappear. . . .Labour will get further away from the slave idea of delegating responsibility, but as longas the working class has that idea, they will be slaves.&quot; Such are the inconsistenciesand obscurities upon this matter to which one of the ablest leaders of labour to-daycommits himself.The position with regard to this matter is affected by most of the principal questionswhich underlie Trade Union constitutions. So far as written constitutions go, the mainpoints are : (a) For what periods are the various officials elected, and what means are provided,by referendum or otherwise, whereby the members as a whole may exercisetheir will, even if opposed to that of the officials, during the latter&apos;s period ofoffice ?(6) What are the spheres within which the officials, once appointed, are allowed tomake decisions on their own responsibility ?(c) In what manner, and to what extent, do the various officials of the Union actas a check upon one another ?(d) How far is the governing machinery truly representative of all particular interestswithin the Union ?In practice it is clear, however, that the printed rules are not the final word on thissubject. A constitution can never be so rigidly drawn that it does not leave scope for agreat deal of &quot; interpretation.&quot; The way in which the rules are applied is to someextent a matter of custom and convenience, and is determined as much by the generalattitude of the members towards the officials as by the form of the machinery itself. Thereare many gradations, from the Union whose constitution provides for &quot; representatives &quot;but whose representatives are in effect merely &quot; delegates,&quot; to the Union which limits itsleaders on paper to the position of delegates but accords them in practice wide powersas representatives. These considerations are exemplified to a certain extent in the casesof the A.S.E. and N.U.R., and the following points in their respective organisations maybe noted : (a) The secretary of the N.U.R. holds office &quot; during the pleasure, of the members &quot; ;while the secretary of the A.S.E. is normally elected for three years.(6) The E.C. of the N.U.R. meets normally once a quarter ; the E.C. of the A.S.E.sits permanently at headquarters.- . (c) In the N.U.R. should two-thirds of the branches in any district be dissatisfiedwith their representative, they can demand a poll on the matter at the end ofany year. The seven members of the A.S.E. Executive Committee on theother hand are elected for a period of three years.(d) The Executive of the N.U.R. is under no obligation to take a referendum of therank and file on any matter whatsoever, but the democratic principle ismaintained by placing it under the control of the A.G-.M. which is in effectthe supreme governing body, very carefully chosen so as to give effect to allinterests, both territorial and functional. On the other hand, in the A.S.E.the District Committees can frame their own industrial policy in so far as itdoes not involve expenditure from central funds, and no agreement can becompleted by the E.C. until submitted to the districts affected. The rulesof the A.S.E. further provide for the use of the referendum in certain cases,&quot; and for the summoning in emergencies of a special Delegate Meeting consistingof one delegate for each five thousand members, and for a Final AppealCourt of judicial character.The practical working of these two Trade Unions shows a wide margin of interpretation.The Secretary of the N.U.R. holds his position like a delegate, merely during the pleasureof the members ; but if it becomes the custom and it is found satisfactory that he shouldnormally retain office during the full term, this custom is likely to grow as strong as anyrule that was ever drawn. Secondly, in the complications of a constitution responsibilityis varied, one element holding it in one way. and another in another, and, in any event,the position depends on where circumstances place the emphasis. Thus the security ofthe Secretary of the A.S.E. as compared with that of the N.U.R. is more than counter-balanced by the fact that he is responsible to an E.C. in permanent session, whereas theE.C. of the N.U.R. only meets once a quarter. Finally, safeguards are no use if they donot work. Under (a) above it would appear that power in the N.U.R. is more highlycentralised ; yet the circumstances of the war produced the Shop Stewards movement-
a protest against A.S.E. centralisation, because the machinery of the referendum was.found inadequate, and in spite of the fact that the E.C. went the length of summoninga national conference of delegates from the various district committees a body for which,the rules make no provision.It is clear that, at any time, immediate effect can be given to a movement in thedirection of delegation. No doubt, if the orientation of opinion remained unchanged,such a movement would ultimately find a partial expression in the changes and develop-ments continually taking place in Trade Union and Federation constitutions. But for itto become effective there is no need for it to wait until rules are altered; and, in caseswhere the views of leaders are broader than those of the rank and file, this makes thequestion more urgent and dangerous than it would otherwise be.Passing now to more general considerations, the practical weaknesses of the principleof delegation in this sphere are three. In the first place, the matters discussed in the courseof industrial negotiation at the present day are often complex, technical, and involvedistinctions that require some intellectual subtlety and yet make great practical difference..Such matters the rank and file are simply not competent to handle. They may be ableto express a &quot; will,&quot; but the consequences of that will are quite likely to be unworkable..Secondly, the rank and file acting as the rank and file is completely amoral and entirelyirresponsible. No single individual member has any appreciable responsibility for whatis done, and this fact is reflected in his voting : lie does not vote for what he thinks is.just, nor does he pay much regard to obligations by which he may be bound ; he votesfor what he, personally, wants. This phenomenon is well known in political elections.Vote-catching proposals are always those which look as if they will give the voter some-thing he personalty would like to have. The same has been seen often enough in theindustrial sphere. The rank and file will back a strike for something, like a wage increase,which closely affects each one of them in. a way they rarely will, for any more profound orconstructive charge. Of this the present miners&apos; nationalisation campaign is a strikingexample. If it fails it Avill fail because the miners have failed sufficiently to connectthe idea of nationalisation in the minds of the rank and file with the idea of personal andconcrete prosperity. Finally ,under the.principle of delegation, businesslike negotiationbecomes impossible, because this involves a certain elasticity of judgment and freedom ofaction that the delegate does not possess.In negotiations between employers and Trade,Unions this weakness is often verymarked, and is a considerable obstacle to a settlement. An offer which the employerswill make to representatives who are in a position to close with it immediately is some-times one which they will not make to delegates who have to submit the terms to theirmembers for acceptance. In such cases the employers feel that in the course of a referenceto the full membership of the Union any concession is liable to be interpreted as a sign ofweakness on the employers&apos; side, and may be made the basis for further demands. Thereare, on the other hand, some matters in connection with which the delegation principlehas certain merits as in questions regarding &quot; working conditions,&quot; where the whole aimis that the rank and file should be satisfied. But the danger is that a close correspondencebetween the views of leaders and members on such matters may create a situation by whichthe activities of the leaders are limited in matters of general policy, and of greater diffi-culty. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; states that &quot; the day of&apos; representative &apos; rulers and leadersis past; that of executives carrying out the will of their constituent bodies has arrived.&quot;When, however, the business of the Union is concerned with large questions of policy, andwhen it approximates in character to the. control of a great business enterprise, it isobvious that the good of the whole will not always coincide with the good of the individual.In such cases the outlook of the mere &quot; delegate &quot; is limited to that of his members,whereas what is needed by the Union is wisdom- and sound direction from above,. -strengthened by ability to create an opinion in the minds of the majority of the members..Every working Trade Union official knows that the delegation principle if completelyapplied would simply render Trade Union machinery unworkable. An experiencedofficer of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, of which the Right Hon. John Hodge,M.P., is President, recently wrote as follows :-&quot; The function of a Trade Union leader is tplead the workmen he represents, and to lead them courageously. . . . Nothing tends,to destroy the confidence of an employer in a trade union representative more than for thelatter to be continually presenting claims that are of% extravagant nature and cannotbe sustained. .&quot; . . The methods adopted by certain, unions in appointing&apos; officials,,however, inevitably leads to this obvious evil. . . . I do seriously submit that oncean official has been appointed, such appointment subject to satisfactory conduct ought tobe of a permanent character, the court of appeal being the executive council  .   , ....(01966) &apos;   v M2
s(otherwise) what happens when it is a question of fighting his own members on points onwhich his own conscience tells him they haven&apos;t a case ? To tender sound advice, to obeythe dictates of conscience, and to give a courageous lead is to court disaster when the nextelection takes place.&quot; ,Part II. Departmental.The Ministry and the National Relief Fund.Measures have recently been taken by the Committee of the National Relief Fund toapply the funds remaining in their hands to the relief of distress arising in consequence ofthe war. The Ministry of Labour is in several directions closely associated with thisapplication of the Fund. Attention has already been drawn to the steps taken to makepart of the relief fund available in centres where, owing to the cessation of out-of-workdonation, distress still remains prevalent which is attributable directly to the war.* TheLocal Employment Committees are in close touch with the local authorities to whom theCommittee of the National Relief Fund have issued an invitation to investigate the need fora, grant in their locality and to set up special local committees to administer any grant whichmay be made. In many parts the Employment Committees are urging the local authoritiesto set up these committees, and, where this step has been taken, have appointed representa-tives to serve as members. The Employment Exchanges are assisting applicants for grantsfrom the Fund to establish their position. Certificates are provided, to be produced beforethe committees responsible for administering grants from the Fund, to show that theapplicant is not receiving out-of-work donation or unemployment benefit and that suitableemployment is not available.The Ministry are also associated with the Committee of the&apos; National ReliefFund in assisting those who wish to emigrate.   A sum of  250,000, which at a later. data may be increased to  500,000, has been set aside from the National ReliefFund to assist in this work of overseas settlement.   A joint committee has beenset up to administer this grant, composed of representatives of the committee of theNational Relief Fund and of the Overseas Settlement Committee of the Ministry ofLabour.  Applications for assistance will in all cases be considered individually by thisjoint committee, but the services of the Local Employment Committees, Local WarPensions Committees, and ether bodies, have been called into play in the selection ofcandidates.   All applications will, in the first case, be considered by one of these bodies,and only after recommendation by one of them will the joint committee takeaction.    It will be necessary to show that the hardship from which relief is soughtarises out of the war, this qualification being required to satisfy the purposes for whichthe National Relief Fund was instituted.   It is necessary also that the intending settlersshould either be approved under one of the agricultural settlement schemes of theoverseas Governments, or should have employment already ensured for them, or, at least,should propose to join responsible friends or relatives.   In general, preference will begiven to those who wish to settle within the British Empire, but, where the circumstanceswarrant it, assistance will not be refused to prospective settlers in other countries. Apartfrom these provisos, there are few limitations in the extent of the scheme, each case beingsettled on its merits.   The joint committee have indicated that they are willing to considerthe case of those who, having done war service, are not entitled to passages underthe Government scheme for the settlement overseas of ex-members of the Forces ; orthose who, though accepted under that scheme, are still in need of additional assistanceeither for themselves, their dependants or members of their families who cannot claimassistance as dependants.   Orphan children going to some recognised institution abroadwill receive consideration, as will also persons dependent on relatives who offer a homeoverseas, and, in general, all for whom emigration is likely to prove the best means ofassistance.   Grants will be made for passage money, railway fares and personal outfitor to meet the cost of equipment and the initial expenses involved in starting life overseas.It is believed that the number of applicants will be sufficiently large to absorb the fundsavailable in a comparatively short time.The Ministry are also specialty concerned with the administration of a further grantof  500;000 which has been set aside to provide work and training for women who areunemployed as a consequence of war conditions, or whose capacity or opportunity forgaining a livelihood has been adversely affected by the war.   To administer this sum,See this Report for the 28th January, p. 48.
together with the balance of the Queen&apos;s &quot;Work for Women&quot; Fund, the Ministerhas appointed, as a Standing Committee, the Central Committee on Wonlen&apos;s Training andEmployment. The committee includes members of the Ministry, and the Accountant-General of the Ministry is acting as financial adviser. The general plans of the committeehave still to be completed. Their work, however, will-be carried on in close co-operationwith the Training Department in order that there may be no overlapping of activities.In the selection of candidates the committee will also have the assistance of the Employ-ment Exchanges and of the Women&apos;s Professional Register. Special consideration will begiven to ex-members of the Women&apos;s Forces, and to those whose war work interruptedtraining for some normal form of womens work. In general, the funds available will bedevoted to the establishment of maintenance scholarships which, it is hoped, will enablea large number of women to qualify for employment as teachers under the Board ofEducation, for commercial posts involving a knowledge of modern languages, for postsin connection with public health under the Ministry of Health, for the legal profession, ormedicine and for other posts where openings for trained women present themselves.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.Foreign Affairs.The resumption of the inter-Allied negotiations in London appear to have caused amarked increase in the attention paid by the Labour and Socialist Press to foreign affairs.The principal topic discussed is again the carrying out of Part VII of the Treaty of Peace- with Germany.*  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; registers its opposition to any attempt strictlyto enforce these sections of the Peace Treaty in a leading article, which is not remarkablefor the clarity of its argument and which fails to show why these clauses should be obnoxiousto the Socialist movement.  In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson confesses that cir-cumstances have changed his opinion on such matters as these, and recommends theacceptance of a compromise whereb)r the &quot; war criminals &quot; may be tried by neutraltribunals.   He thinks that the moral obloquy that would follow condemnation by suchtribunals would be a severe and a sufficient penalty.   The &quot; Nation,&quot; however, connectsthe question of &quot; war criminals &quot; with the rumoured French proposal to postpone theevacuation from the Rhine provinces of the armies of occupation.   The suggestion of thispaper is that the French Government is rigidly insisting upon the exact fulfilment of theclauses in the hope that an opportunity may occur for the putting into operation ofPart XIV of the Treaty of Peace.  This suspicion leads the &quot;Nation&quot; into an attackupon the French Government.  The Government of the United Kingdom does not,however, escape censure, and the conclusion of the &quot; Nation &quot; is that the establishment ofradical-labour Governments in both countries is needed if Europe is to be saved andthe friendship between the two countries to be maintained. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is ovenmore outspoken and declares that a fundamental difference in the attitude of the peoplesof the two countries towards Germany is the cause of the trouble.   This paper sees littlechance in the immediate future of the evolution of a common policy capable of beingsupported by French and English public opinion alike.  Nevertheless the &quot; New States-man &quot; does not think that a natural divergence of opinion would have grown into what,in its opinion, is an &quot; ugly antagonism,&quot; had it not been for an excessive prolongation ofthe peace conference and the &quot; short-sightedness and unscrupulousness &quot; of its members.This paper especially condemns any close and formal Anglo-French Alliance, as beingopposed to our interests and incompatible with our membership of the League of Nations.Last week this recrudescence of anti-French feeling was noticeable ; this week it is thedominant feature of the discussions on foreign affairs.   One result, in the &quot; Nation,&quot; isthe favourable treatment of Italy.  &quot; In her general European policy, Italy is now perhapsthe most enlightened of the Allies,&quot; and Signor Nitti is compared&apos; favourably withM. Millerand.  This somewhat refined analysis of Anglo-French differences does not,however, appear to appeal to the more extreme elements.  Correspondents in the &quot; LabourLeader &quot; and in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; explain the rumoured insistence of theAllies upon the exact fulfilment of Part VII of the Treaty of Peace, as resulting from adeliberate attempt to provoke a reaction in Germany. * This reaction, they believe, isdesired in order that a &quot;spring offensive &quot; against the Soviet Government of Russiamay be more efficiently pursued.* Tho articles reviewed were, of course, written.before the publication of the Notes on this subject to.the German and Netherland Governments,  The notes were printed in &quot; The Times &quot; of 17th inst.
The Labour Movement.The discussion which has been proceeding recently at the various divisional con-ferences of the I.L.P. on the relations of that party to the two Socialist Internationals andto the National Labour Party is reflected in the discussions in the papers reviewed thisweek on the political future of the Labour movement. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; continuesits discussion of the position of the International Socialist movement and declares that weare witnessing at the present time the break up of Socialist unity. This paper thinks it.quite possible that three or more separate Socialist Internationals may develop out of theexisting conditions. So long, however, as the attention of British Labour is fixed upon-domestic issues, this paper does not think that the British Labour movement will followthe disintegration of European Socialism, and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; points out that, thefederal constitution of the Labour Party may perhaps make it possible for it to combineinto one national body societies which internationally are affiliated to bodies very hostileto each other. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; declares that he understandsand shares the disappointment in the Second International which is obviously felt by agreat body of I.L.P. members. He devotes himself, however, to a criticism of the ThirdInternational. He doubts whether it can properly be said to exist, and stresses the factthat its first session, which formulated its policy, was thoroughly unrepresentative.Mr. Snowden repeats the official policy of I.L.P. headquarters on the matter, namely, thatan endeavour must be made to bring together all the sections of the Socialist movementwith a view to forming a united international body. In the light of the &quot; New Statesman &quot;article, Mr. Philip SnowTden seems somewhat too optimistic in his hopes for internationalSocialist unity : in the light of the more extreme articles in the more extreme papers, the&quot; New Statesman &quot; appears to be too optimistic in its hopes for the continued unity ofthe British Socialist and Labour movement. Mr. Clifford Allen contributes a long letterto the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in which he stresses the need for the I.L.P. retaining its peculiarand distinctive character. Mr. Allen does not see any immediate prospect of the Labour-Party, as at present constituted, being returned to power in sufficient numbers to founda government on the support of its own members. He foresees therefore that the questionof a coalition between the Labour Party and some other political party may arise in thefuture. The formation of such a coalition would, he thinks, immensely increase theresponsibility of the I.L.P. The I.L.P. would have to maintain a critical attitude towardssuch a coalition and be prepared, if necessary, to contemplate the formation of a new-Labour Party. He calls for a strengthening of the head office of the I.L.P., an increasedexpenditure upon I.L.P. organisation, the institution of an I..L.P. publicity branch, andthe reformation of the I.L.P.. system of distributing literature. One of Mr. Allen&apos;s mainpoints is that the provision in the new constitution of the Labour Party for the directadmission of individual members has robbed the I.L.P. of its old monopoly of individualmembers, and comments by other people would seem to show that this is a main cause ofdiscontent. In a leading article the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; complains that all sorts andconditions of men are joining the Labour Party, that this party is becoming a refuge fordisappointed politicians, disgruntled public servants, and ambitious place hunters. &quot; Itis bad enough for a wealth)&quot; trade union to bribe a local Labour Party to accept anincompetent candidate by relieving it of all financial effort, but it is infinitely worse to sellthe seat to a political nonentity who offers to pay all expenses.&quot; In &quot; The Call &quot; Mr. ArthurSiffleet complains that middle-class politicians are now entering the Labour movement inlarge numbers, and fears that the more cunning of these intend to operate capitalismbehind a nominally Labour government. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot; TheSocialist&quot; concentrate upon the favour the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has lately been showing toLord Fisher and Lord Haldane. &quot; The Socialist &quot; declares that capitalism is mouldingin its own shape the British Labour Party, and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; calls uponits communist colleagues to leave that party.Mines Nationalisation.The results of the interview between the Prime Minister and the ParliamentaryCommittee of the T.U.C. and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation have resulted infurther comments on the mines nationalisation question. The House of Commons debateof the Ilth inst. occurred too late to be noticed except by the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; NewStatesman,&quot; which both think that Mr. Lunn made a foolish speech, but maintain thatthe Prime Minister made no proper answer to Mr. Brace&apos;s arguments. Mr. Philip Snowdenin the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; leans to the opinion that the electors are not unfavourable tothe nationalisation of the mines, and insists that the miners must carry public opinionwith them.  He. recommends Labour, therefore, to act with caution and restraint, and
thinks that the miners will secure their object by continuing to fight the issue on thepolitical plane. The &quot; New Age &quot; complains that an official change of policy on the partof the miners, and a confession that their first plans have not been unbrokenly successfulseems never to occur to them as a possible alternative to an attempt to force the Govern-ment. This paper declares that the private and personal beliefs of many miners&apos; leadershave undergone a complete change. In its opinion the initial mistake was made whenthe miners accepted the burden of formulating a system for the mining industry alternativeto the old one. They had established their case, thinks this paper, when they had shownthat the continuance of the pre-Avar system could not be tolerated. They were in aposition to exercise an effective veto over any reconstructive proposals; and their demandfor nationalisation, as their unalterable recipe for the mining industry, was an act ofsuperfluous folly. &quot; The Socialist&quot; firmly believes that the miners&apos; leaders are meditatinga retreat from their position, and foresees that they will endeavour to save their faces bymaking the nationalisation question purely a political issue.Government Policy.Mr. H. M. Hyndman contributes to &quot; Justice &quot; an energetic article in favour of theMinistry of Food being made a permanent department of State. He insists that thisMinistry is the only one competent to serve the interests of the consumers of the country.The Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture, in his opinion, concern themselvesentirely with the interests of producers. The &quot; New Age &quot; discusses Government financein the light of Mr. McKenna&apos;s speech to the annual meeting of the London Joint City andMidland Bank. This paper insists that in considering the purposes for which credit iscreated, the real distinction does not lie between private and public expenditure butbetween the production of necessities and the production of luxuries. The only differencethat this paper can detect between the two operations, expansion of credit for Governmentpurposes and expansion for commercial purposes, is that the first operation raises thelevel of prices in general, while the second operation raises the prices of necessities inparticular. It may be noted that the &quot; New Statesman &quot; in considering the ParliamentarySession, foresees trouble with the Labour Party in connection with the reorganisation ofthe Territorial Force,- and, of the three Bills to be introduced by the Minister of Labour,only refers to the Hours of Employment Bill in order to suggest that the Government cannotreally intend to pass it into law. The housing question is now considered in these papersmainly in connection with the Manchester Building Guild Committee. The &quot; NeAv Age &quot;is more favourable to the scheme of this committee than it Avas last week. &quot; Rob Roy,&quot;in &quot; Forward,&quot; points out that the committee has not yet met the need for dilution,and suggests that an extension of these guild operations may only result in the non-guildareas being starved for labour. . &quot; Rob Roy &quot; thinks that the building trades musttake steps to recruit additional labour. The Court of Inquiry, Avhich has beenappointed under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, is referred to many times, and its pro-ceedings, and especially Mr. Bevin&apos;s address, meet with unqualified praise. Mr,-Snowdenpoints out the uses of such public inquiries as public indictments of capitalism. There isno reference to the fact that the Industrial Courts Bill in its passage through the House ofCommons met with considerable opposition and suspicion from the Labour movement.Wages and the Cost of Living.Three references to this subject are worthy of note. Mr. H. M. Hyndman, in hisarticle in &quot; Justice,&quot; referred to above, attacks the Board of Trade for never hesitating toturn out falsified statistics upon the community. He declares that such statistics havebeen even more grossly forged of late than ever before, and quotes as an example the&quot; Labour Gazette &quot; Cost of Living Index Number. The &quot; NeAv Statesman &quot; refers to SirLynden Macassey&apos;s mention of the report of Lord Sumner&apos;s committee on Working ClassExpenditure in the course of his address to the transport workers&apos; enquiry. This paperthinks it necessary to point out that working class expenditure is very different from thecost of living, and that the report of Lord Sumner&apos;s committee cannot be used for thepurpose of calling^in question the &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; figures. Mr, C. Watkinscontinues in the &quot;Railway Review&quot; the discussion upon the sliding scale clauseAvhich was incorporated in the agreement between the N.U.R. and the Ministry-ofTransport. For the first time in this discussion some detailed criticism of the slidingscale and the cost of living index number is made. Mr. Watkins thinks that the indexnumber.is suspect as proceeding from a &quot; department of the Capitalist class.&quot; The&quot; Labour Gazette &quot; figures, he claims, are in conflict with other authorities and incom-patible with the practical experiences of householders.  As an example of the other
authorities, he mentions the &quot; Economist &quot; index number. * The sliding scale he criticiseson the ground that it allows only a shilling increase for every five points increase in theindex number, whereas he argues that the scale should provide for an increase of a shillingin the pound. He does not appreciate the need for stating the basis upon which he wouldcalculate this shilling in the pound increase; whether upon the new standard rates ofpay, or upon the pre-war rates of pay, or upon the present earnings of the railwaymen..He makes this criticism, however, in the assumption that the cost of living will increasein the future. In spite, however, of this discussion of details, the burden of Mr. Watkinsrcomplaint is exactly similar to that of Messrs. Mainwaring and Craitf He fears thesliding scale will have a stultifying effect on the working-class movement, and will tendto crystallize the existing social arrangements.PAET IV.-GrENEBAL TOPICS.Survey of the General Situation.A momentary lull has ensued upon the abnormal activity of last week in the Labourworld. To some extent interest has been transferred from the industrial to the politicalsphere. In the House of Commons the Unemployment Insurance Bill has been re-introduced, and the Coal Mines (Emergency) Bill has passed its second reading. Withregard to nationalisation, the decisive rejection of the miners&apos;amendment to the Address,although nothing else was expected, throws the onus of deciding on the next stepon the Miners&apos; Federation and the Trades Union Congress. The situation that has thusbeen created is dealt with in some detail below.Survey of Industrial Disputes.The outstanding feature of the industrial situation this week, so far as demands anddisputes are concerned, is the application of the National Union of Operative Bakers foran all-round advance of 15s. a week, and for the speedy settlement of the night-bakingquestion. Some further progress has been made in the negotiations between the Ship-building and Engineering Employers Federation and the Engineering and ShipbuildingTrade Unions at York, and there is some prospect of an agreement on the vexed questionof piece-Avork. Details of a provisional agreement effected with the Unions representingthe unskilled workers appear on page 96. The lockout of operative painters in Yorkshirecontinues, the men having placed themselves in a somewhat strong position by adoptinga scheme of direct labour. It is understood that applications for all-round increases ofwages haye been made on behalf of tram and omnibus drivers by the National Federationof Transport Workers ; and cn behalf of railway shopmen, by the Engineering and Ship-building Trades Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen. In the latter casetwo separate demands have been put forward and it is expected that the Engineering andShipbuilding Trades Federation will withdraw from the negotiations with the N.U.R.and repudiate the railwaymeirs authority to speak or negotiate on behalf of the craftunions.&apos; Several minor disputes have been settled during the week, and the generalsituation is fairly quiet, very few actual stoppages being in progress.The Unemployment Position.The reduction in the number of persons on unemployment benefit and out-of-workdonation has been very considerable during the week ending the 6th February. H.M.Forces policies lodged were 344,094 on the 6th February, compared with 377,116 on the30th January, a reduction of 33,022. The number of unemployment books remaininglodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 6th February was 87,127 for menand 29,665 for women, compared with 97,773 for males, and 29,703 for females at the30th. January, a total reduction of 10,684.A corresponding result is shown by the figures of Employment Exchange live registerswhich at the 30th January were 478,173 men, 52,479 women, 27,556 juveniles, comparedwith live registers at &quot;the 6th February of 443,085 men, 51,899&apos;&apos;women, 25,497 juveniles,showing a reduction of 35,088 men, 580 women, 2 059 juveniles.* The &quot;Economist1&apos; on 10th January published a review of the course of prices during last year.

Report, 11th inst., p. 73.
The Nationalisation of the Mines.Little change has. occurred in the situation since it was last reported on. Mr. Smillie,Mr. Hodges and other representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have beenin Brussels at a conference of the International Committee of Miners, and in their absenceno decision could be taken with regard to the next step in the campaign for the nationalisa-tion of the mines, and the attitude of the miners towards the report of the independentaccountant into the financial position of the coal industry. A conference of the executiveof the Federation will, however, be held on the 19th February, and will have before itthree important matters : first; the action to be taken in connection with the nationalisationof the mines ; second, the inter-related questions of coal profits and prices, the shortage ofdomestic coal, and the effect of prices and profits on the cost of living, and in connectiontherewith the report of the independent accountant on the financial position of theindustry ; and third, their attitude to the Coal Mines (Emergency) Bill. On the firstmatter it is probable that no action will be taken until the special Trades Union Congress.On the second question, the executive will probably ask for another interview with thePrime Minister. It will be remembered that at their last interview with the PrimeMinister on the 28th January, it was agreed that they might again interview him afterthe receipt of the independent accountants figures.A national conference of miners&apos; delegates from all the coalfields will probably besummoned to meet before the special Trades Union Congress, and at this conference thequestion of making a new wage demand will probably be discussed. Over a month agoit was pointed out in this Report (p. 22), that &quot; there is no doubt that the introductionof a wage demand into the nationalisation programme, however it might weaken it fromthe standpoint of logical consistency, would undoubtedly popularise the campaign in themind of the miner, to whom the theoretical principle of nationalisation seems very remotefrom his real life.&quot; The most recent information suggests that the Federation may decideto advance a national wage claim, and to transfer, in the meantime at least, the questionof nationalisation to the purely political sphere. Much will depend on the attitude of thedelegates from the district associations and federations as expressed at the nationalconference, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the Miners&apos; Federation could notcount on the unanimous support of their own districts in a strike for nationalisation.And in these circumstances they could hardly ask the Trades Union Congress to vote infavour of direct action.If the Federation were to decide on a policy of direct action to enforce nationalisation,they would probably find that they were acting contrary to the desire of two of the mostimportant district organisations, namely the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the York-shire Miners&apos; Association. From South Wales it is reported that at several local meetingsthe executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have been vigorously attackedon the grounds that before formulating any policy as to wages and prices they should haveconsulted the rank and file, and that they should not have been so altruistic as to suggestthat profits extracted from miners should be used to reduce the cost of living. Referencehas several times in this Report been made to the prevalence of the element of revoltamongst the South Wales miners, and the present position appears to be that Whateverthe policy of the M.F.G.B., it will not receive Avhole-hearted support in. South Wales unlessit involves in some wray a demand for an increase in wages. The view is being increas-ingly held among South Wales miners that they are quite able to manage their own affairs,and if they should decide to take matters into their own hands, it is more than likely thatthey would demand not nationalisation, but a wage-advance. Mr. Brace continues toexert a moderating influence both by his speeches and in the local press. In the &quot; WesternMail,&quot; for the 17th February, he suggests that it would be an overwhelming reply to theGovernments refusal to nationalise the mines if the forthcoming Trades Union Congressdetermined to find a quarter of a million pounds so that at the next general election everyseat would be contested by a Labour candidate.&apos; In Yorkshire there is stated to be no desire among the rank and file for a strike. Thefunds of the association were seriously depleted by the last strike, which gained remarkablylittle, and the President of the Association, Mr. H. Smith, as was remarked on in thisReport two or three weeks ago, has declared himself against direct action. It is reportedfrom Lancashire that the opinion of the miners is that their best policy would be to waituntil the end of March when the cotton operatives make their demands for increased wages,and in the meantime reach some agreement with them whereby they could then take jointaction for enforcing their demands. This suggestion recalls the rumours current severalmonths ago to the effect that the formation of a Quadruple Alliance, to consist of the TripleAlliance and the cotton operatives, was being considered.  In reality, owing to diversity(C 1966) N
of interest and other reasons, there was never any likelihood of such an alliance beingeffected, and there is equally little probability that such a temporary working agreementas is now suggested could be reached by the miners and cotton operatives. To sum up,the general opinion may be expressed that a strike, even of the miners alone, to enforcenationalisation is extremely unlikely, and the possibility of a general strike or a strike ofthe Triple Alliance may, in the meantime, be dismissed altogether. It is probable, how-ever, that the Miners&apos; Federation will make a demand for increased wages, and it may beexpected that this will be pressed with great vigour.- The Railways.In view of the support which Mr. J. H. Thomas has given to the proposals of theLondon Electric Railways to increase fares on the Underground Railways, and to abolishworkmen&apos;s fares, it is interesting to note that his. name appears as a sponsor on the Billswhich the London Electric Railways and the associated organisations are promoting. Itis also interesting in view of this entente between railway labour and railway capital thatMr. C. T. Cramp was among the speakers at a meeting of railway shareholders held on the11th February, which was called to approve a public announcement that the shareholdersare convinced that the claims of workers for sufficient wages must come before the claimsof the shareholders for dividends.Hours of Employment Bill.In connection with the question of the inclusion of agriculture in this Bill, conferenceshave taken place between the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesand the Secretary for Scotland, and an agreement has been reached as to the conditionsunder whioh, with adequate safeguards, agriculture may be included in the Bill. Theprinciple has been adopted that, in the case of agriculture, the limitation of hours providedfor in the Bill shall be calculated on an average taken over the year as a whole, but shallnot necessitate the restriction of work to an equal number of hours each week, and thatovertime, paid for at not less than time and a quarter, shall be worked in accordance withany agreement made between an employer and his workpeople. With regard to thisproposal conferences between the Minister and representatives of various interests inagriculture will take place on the 19th and 20th February.Unemployment Insurance Bill.The Minister introduced this Bill in the House of Commons on the 16th February.The Bill differs in certain minor respects from the Bill introduced last session, but the slightalterations which have been made do not involve any departure from the principles onwhich the Bill is based. The Boot and Shoe Joint Industrial Council has appointed aspecial sub-committee to consider the possibility of forming a special scheme under thisBill. It is reported that the executive of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, CabinetMakers and Joiners announces that it refuses to administer the Unemployment InsuranceActs under the old terms and that it will refuse to administer the new UnemploymentInsurance Bill if it is passed into law, on the ground that the financial terms are such thatthe administration of the State scheme means an actual loss to the general funds of theSociety undertaking administration.The Building Guild Movement.The Manchester Building Guild. Scheme was explained to members of the LondonBuilding Trades Federation and others at a public demonstration in the Kingsway Hallon the 16th February. Mr. S. G. Hobson, the Secretary of the Manchester Building GuildCommittee, stated that the procedure in Manchester and Warrington was being followedin nearly a dozen other towns in Lancashire, and he hoped before many weeks had passedthat the Manchester Building Guild Committee would be transformed into the North-Western Building Guild. If that should take place, he thought that they would not hesitateto offer to build 100,000 houses for the Government. Mr. Hobson explained in detail thenecessity for making the 10 per. cent, charge over net cost for overhead charges. Mr.Lewis Watson, Chairman of the Manchester Guild Committee, stated that he had soundedmany meetings during the last six weeks, and at all of them the workers had unanimouslydeclared that they were prepared to join in Guild work, and as a means of testing theirsincerity, he proposed to send out a request to every branch of every trade union in theManchester district, asking for volunteers to sign their names. He believed that theManchester Guild would be at work in six weeks, and he had no doubt there would beconsiderably more men ready to work for the Guild than there would be work for them to
do. Mr. George Hicks, General Secretary of the Operative Bricklayers Society, whopresided at the meeting, proposed a resolution pledging the meeting to support the BuildingGuild Committee, and undertaking to work in harmony with all Guild Committees formedin the London area.   This was carried with one dissentient.The Manchester Building Guild Committee has now made a definite offer to theManchester Housing Committee to build 2,000 houses according to any specified type, andthe Housing Committee has invited the Guild Committee to discuss the proposal in detail.Stockport Building Operatives are considering the formation of a Committee similar to theManchester one.General Staff for Labour^The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is making a demand for progress with regard to the formationof a General Staff for Labour, the desirability of which Avas much discussed immediatelyafter the railAA^ay strike. The &quot; Herald &quot; maintains that the need for the General Staffis clamant in view of the necessity for making still more clear the solidarity of labour. Itseems fairly unfikety, hoAvever, that much progress on the formation of the General Staffwill be reported to the special Trade Union Congress. At present there is a good dealof suspicion between some of the most important unions, and the movement to set up aGeneral Council Avhich AArould have authority over each and all is not meeting Avith muchsupport.Amalgamation.A number of amalgamations AArhich have been suggested are now being brought to asuccessful conclusion. The proposals for the amalgamation of the United Operative Masonsand Granite Workers Union, the United Operative Masons&apos; Association of Scotland, theEdinburgh and Leith Operative Tile Layers&apos; Society, and the Scottish Associated Paviors&apos;Federal Union are noAA*- complete and are to be submitted to a ballot of the respecti\reunions. The title of the newT body will be the Builders&apos; and Monumental Workers&apos;Association. In connection with the proposed amalgamation betAveen the United GarmentWorkers&apos; Union and the Scottish Tailors, an advertisement has been inserted in the&quot; Daily Herald &quot; by the former Union urging shop ste\A^ards and members to do everythingpossible to see that every vote is cast on the question. With regard to the proposedamalgamation betAveen the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehouse-men and Clerks, the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, and the Warehouse-men and General Workers&apos; Union, meetings have recently been held to support the project.It is reported that the Amalgamated Union of Enginemen and Cranemen, Boiler Firemenand Wire Rope Workers have decided by a ballot vote to amalgamate Avith the NationalUnion of General Workers. It is stated that a combination of the Bank- Officers&apos; Guild,the National Federation of LaAv Clerks, the Guild of Insurance Officials, and the NationalGuild of Accounts&apos; Clerks is possible in the near future.Trade Union Friction.The result of the arbitration on the dispute at the British Mannesmann Tube Works,Avhere it will be remembered about two thousand men Avere involved in a strike becauseone Avorkman refused to contribute to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, preferringto retain his membership with the National Union of General Workers, is being awaitedAAfith great interest by various trade unions which cater for the workmen in the steel andtinplate trades. The officials of these trade unions appear to be convinced that it is theintention of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation to do everything possible to squeezeout rival organisations. The Dockers&apos; Union officials are particularly apprehensive, andthey state that if a &quot; squeeze-out &quot; policy is adopted against their members in the steeland tinplate works the issues raised would be fought to the extent of involving the labourin the ports of the Bristol Channel. It will be remembered that friction of a.somewhatsimilar kind betAveen the skilled craft unions and general workers unions occurred at WestBroinwich between the Friendly Society of Iron Founders on the one hand and theAmalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers on the other. ^The TradesUnion Congress attempted to overcome the difficulties at West Bromwich, but the frictionstill remains, and the Emergency Committee of the Friendly Society of Iron Foundershave recently addressed a circular letter to the executives of the engineering craft unionsdrawing attention to the attitude of the Workers&apos; Union, which it is alleged is taking intoits organisation men Avho should rightly belong to the craft unions. The circular statesthat the outcome of this is that the Avages obtained by the craftsmen in the Workers&apos; Unionare much beloAv those obtained by the members of the craft unions.  The executives of(C 1966) N2
the craft unions are invited to meet to discuss the whole position with a view to comingto a common understanding as to the relationship which shall subsist between the craftunions and the Workers&apos; Union. Friction also exists between the engineering craft unionsand the general labour unions with regard to the question of payment by results.Trade Unionism among Salaried Workers.In connection with the account of the formation of the National Federation ofProfessional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Workers, which was given inlast week&apos;s report and the discussion there of the difficulties in&apos; the way of this Federationand the opposition that had already materialised towards it, it may be noted that theMiddle Classes&apos; Union has passed a resolution instructing its general secretary to com-municate to the members the information that the Middle Classes&apos; Union is formed for thepurpose of organising the professional, managerial and administrative workers, and thosewhose income is derived from pensions or savings, for their political and domestic interests,and to protect them by collective action against the imposition of injustices either byfederated capital or organised labour. If the Middle Classes&apos; Union succeeds in its policyof development there is thus a prospect that there will be in the immediate future threecompeting associations of professional and administrative workers, and their relations toone another will be watched with interest.Co-operative Union Congress.In view of the rapprochement between Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Move-ment, peculiar interest attaches to the special Congress of the Co-operative Union Avhichopened at Blackpool on the 12th February and was attended by about 1,000 delegates.The primary purpose of the conference was the consideration of proposals for the improve-ment of the machinery of the co-operative movement and for sanctioning importanttrading and other developments. The proposals emanated from a Survey Committeewhich was appointed four years ago. The function of the Co-operative Union has hithertobeen to deal with education and propaganda, but it now proposes to broaden its powersand exert an influence on the commercial side of the movement. It wishes to alter itsconstitution to allow for the organisation of co-operative work in all its branches, whetherthe work be connected with industries, trades or businesses, and for the government ofthe union on broader lines by constituting the Central Board a real board of managementand thus rendering unnecessary the continued existence of the United Board and OfficeCommittees. It is proposed to extend co-operative activity to extractive industries, suchas mining, and to other primary industries such as cotton growing and wool raising, andto increase co-operative ownership of land and mines pending their nationalisation. Theopening of new departments, the undertaking of more extensive advertising, the appoint-ment of canvassers, and the establishment of a special propaganda department with aspecial secretary are advocated. The measures to meet the competition of multiple shopsare detailed, and it is proposed to establish in Manchester a society for the purpose ofreaching the poor. Other proposals deal with the gradual reduction of dividends and anextension of the collective use of profits in schemes of collective life insurance, in providingpensions for members and employees, and assistance to members in cases ;of sickness,accident or distress. The report suggests that an agreement should be entered into withthe trade unions on the following lines : (a) The contracting Societies to agree to pay therecognised trade union standard.of wages for their district, plus an agreed percentage andto observe a shorter working week than the trade union standard for the district. (6) Thetrade unions to agree not to strike against co-operative societies which are parties to thehours and wages agreement so long as they keep ahead on the lines indicated, the societiesgranting to their employees any increase of wages or reduction of hours secured fromoutside employers. The object of this agreement is to &quot; confine the conflict betweenlabour and capital to the outside world.&quot;Owing to opposition on the part of the Wholesale Societies to some of the proposalsof the Survey Committee, the chairman ruled that all points in the report on which therewas a difference of opinion between the-Survey Committee and the Wholesale Societiesshould be the subject of negotiations between the parties, any outstanding points to bediscussed at a future Congress. The Congress also discussed the emergency resolutionsproposed by the Parliamentary Committee, expressing the dissatisfaction of the Congressat the failure of the Government Coal Mines Department to set up effective machineryfor the equitable distribution of available coal supplies and at the consequent hardshipsinflicted upon householders generally. The Congress declared itself of the opinion thatthe only effective means ofovercoming the evils of the present sy stein was the nationalisationof the mines.
Federation of British Industries.A national conference of manufacturers and producers, organised by the Federationof British Industries, was held on the 10th and 11th February, at the Kingsway Hall.Mr. W. P. Rylands presided, and the associations represented were : Association of British&apos;Chambers of Commerce, National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations, Coal Associa-tion, British Engineers&apos; Association, National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers,Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers, the Drug and Fine Chemical Manufacturers&apos;Association, British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation, and the British CommonwealthUnion.   Some textile organisations were also present.Among other resolutions, not of such direct interest from the Labour point of view,Sir A. Nimmo proposed a motion pledging the Conference to oppose in the national interestany attempt to impose State ownership or management on any branch of the industry.Mr. G. W. Mullins (Cold Boiled Brass and Copper Association) proposed an addition to theresolution of the following words :-&quot; The Conference recognises the importance of educatingour workpeople and of associating them with us, so far as possible, in the responsibilitiesof industry and will welcome every well-thought-out experiment to this end, such experi-ments to be made directly between employers and employed, and may be in single estab-lishments or collectively in a trade.&quot; The main resolution with this addendum was carriedunanimously. Lord Gainford moved a resolution viewing with alarm the chaotic conditionof the coal policy of the.country, and recommending that the coal required for industryshould follow its national course in satisfaction of industrial requirements. The generalattitude of this conference appears to have been one of determination to increase productioncoupled with opposition to any extension of Government control over industry.Court of Inquiry.The Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act into the application by theNational Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard minimum wage and other alterationsin the conditions of employment of dock and waterside labour continued its sittings on the11th, 12th and 13th February. On the 11th February, Sir Lynclen Macassey continuedhis address on behalf of the employers. His main point was that a national standardisedminimum wage was impossible in view of the existence of district differentials. Thesedifferentials, he said, include (1) the difference in the conditions under which the work isdone, and in. the character of the work, (2) the difference in the cost of living in the differentdistricts food, rent and other items of that kind, (3) the difference in the size and popu-lation of: the towns in which the work was done. Sir Lynden Macassey also dealt with thetables produced by Mr. Bevin to show the increased cost of living, and after some discussionLord Shaw pointed out that they were asked to arrive at a wage which would be regulativeof the future, and he suggested that the fair comparison would be between householdexpenditure of 1914 and what they would agree to. be normal expenditure in an ordinaryhousehold in the future. They should act on the assumption that a family would goforward on &quot; general post-war normal conditions.&quot;On the 12th February, Sir Alfred Booth, chairman of the Cunard Steamship Company,gave evidence. He maintained that they should have a district and not a national minimumand stated that, if dock labour were paid at the rate of 2s. per hour, the wages of thewhole of the rest of the country would go up by a corresponding amount, with the resultthat prices would rise. He also stated that his impression, after a comparison of returns ofoutput in 1914 and 1919 in Liverpool, was that the reduction in output representedabout 25 per cent.On the 13th February Sir Lynden Macassey continued his address and presented abudget for a family of five of  3 17s., compiled in accordance with the standard arrived atby the Sumner Committee. He also pointed out that the dockers were demanding 88s.per week, compared with the 57s. to 61s. granted to railway goods porters under the,national&apos; agreement, although the work of the two types of workers often mingled. Withregard to the principle of the regulation of wages in accordance with a sliding scaleSir Lynden Macassey stated that they would be prepared to fall in with such a principle,but Mr. Bevin declared that he would not go into any conference room even to discuss it.He maintained that because food prices went down it did hot follow that profits would godown, and in the future as food prices went down they would increase the value of theirwages and improve their standard of life. Mr. J. T. Walton Newbold, lecturer in economichistory to the Central Labour College, and Messrs. Michael Reid of the National &quot;Union ofDock Labourers, and P. McKibbins of the Liverpool Dockers&apos; Union, gave evidence.Mr. Newbold returned to his usual type of charge to the effect that railway, shipping andother companies were closely interlocked, and that owing to this it would be difficult to
discover what were the actual trading profits. Questioned by Mr. Bevin, he stated thathe thought it would be possible for the cost of the increase in wages to be paid out ofthe profits of shipowners, without adding to the cost of commodities to the community.Mr. Reid said that a Liverpool docker could not be expected to give output on a wage of&apos; 2 8s. \\d. (alleged to be the average wage of dockers in Liverpool) and that there was ageneral complaint from the dockers&apos; wives of the inadequacy of their incomes. Mr.McKibbins gave evidence with regard to the &quot;forcing&quot; of foremen. The evidence ofthese witnesses did not contribute much to strengthen Mr. Bevin&apos;s case.Payment by Residts.At the recent conference at York between the Engineering and Shipbuilding EmployersFederations and the trade i nions concerned, the question of payment by results was oneof the most important discussed. The conference as a whole failed to reach an agreementon the matters under discussion, but a partial provisional settlement was secured on thequestion of payment by results between the employers and six unions catering for unskilledand semi-skilled workers. These unions are the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union ofGeneral Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the Dock, Wharf, Riversideand General Workers Union, the National Amalgamated Union of Engineers, Firemen, &amp;c.and the Amalgamated Society of Gas, Municipal and General Workers. In the case ofthe National Union of General Workers, the proposals will be submitted to the variousdistricts for acceptance or rejection. These proposals provide that employers shall havefreedom to introduce systems of payment by results by mutual agreement and subjectto certain conditions. One of the conditions is that the time rate shall be guaranteedirrespective of earnings on piece-work. No change is to be made in the piece-work ratesas a result of which earnings will be reduced. Piece-work prices and bonus bases are tobe such as will enable a workman of average ability to earn at least 33^ per cent.* overpresent time rates, excluding war bonuses. It is understood that one of the conditionson which this agreement has been arrived at is that arrangements shall be made for theeffective establishment of collective bargaining with regard to piece-work prices andpremium bonus schemes. This is an important condition, as it means that the old systemof the fixation of piece-work prices in individual establishments and even in individualcases will: be abolished.The craft unions have not arrived at any agreement with regard to payment by resultsand they have decided to recommend a ballot of their members with a view to securinga * definite instruction on the question. Of these unions the Amalgamated Society ofEngineers is, of course, the most important. Although certain classes of skilled workersin the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, for example the boilermakers, blacksmithsand shipwrights, are accustomed to work on payment by result systems, and althoughthere are few engineering shops of any importance in which no system of payment byresults or premium bonus is in operation, there continues to be much opposition in theengineering and shipbuilding trades generally, especially among skilled workers, to systemsof payment by results. The employers are understood to have made an appeal at therecent conferece for an agreement with regard to payment by results in order that thegreatest possible output may be secured and maintained, and as Mr. J. T. Brownlie, theChairman of the A.S.E., has been emphatic in his advocacy of increased production, it ispossible that the traditional opposition may be to some extent removed. There stillappears, however, to be. great and perhaps not altogether unjustifiable suspicion that theemployers will indulge in rate-cutting through the device of a nominal change in the opera-tion. The fear is also expressed that the result of speeding up production will be to createunemployment after the boom. Probably the establishment of a liberal unemploymentscheme for the engineering trade would influence the negotiations in favour of a system ofpayment by results.Government Discharges.In view of the discharges from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich of disabled ex-Servicemen, a meeting was held at the.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Club at Woolwich on the 12th Februaryto protest. The Organising Secretary of the Ex-Service Men&apos;s Shop Stewards Movementsaid that if disabled men were to be allowed to go out of the Arsenal to compete in.theopen market, it was simply giving them a pass for the workhouse. The meeting expressedthe demand that not one &quot; war hand &quot; should remain in the Arsenal while ex-Service menwere being dismissed.  Protests have been registered also against the decision of the* 25 per cent, has generally been the bonus rate aimed at.
Admiralty to close Dover dockyard establishment on the 31st March. Provision is beingmade that those men who came to Dover from other dockyards are to return to thosedockyards and local men are to receive a month&apos;s notice terminating on the 31st March.International Committee of Miners.Owing to the non-arrival of the German and Austrian delegates to the InternationalMiners Committee which met at Brussels on the 11th February, it was decided to postponeconsideration of the reconstitution of the Miners&apos; International until the 2nd August,when an International Congress will be held at Geneva. At this congress the nationalisa-tion of the mines and the question of the minimum wage will be considered. A resolutionwas passed by the Committee stating that in face of the repeated refusal of the FrenchGovernment to accept the reasonable claims of the miners with a view to the revision ofthe pensions law, the Committee calls on all miners in coal producing countries, to opposeall deliveries of coal in excess of the tonnage already sent to France, and in the event of astrike of French miners to refuse to work overtime in order to produce coal intended forFrench consumption. It is not likely that any real effort will be made to act in accordancewith this resolution. It is rather a pious hope of the same type as the Understandingmade between the English and American iron-moulders recently. But it shows which waythe wind is blowing.E. S.
