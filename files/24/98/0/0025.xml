BEER GRAVITIES, BRWIJlRS&apos; PROFITSMID DRUNKFJNESS..IToto by the Chancellor of the exchequer.(Bee also C*P. 456 and 542.)t)n the 3rd February the Minister of Education circulateda Draft of a Memorandum by Lord D&apos;Abernon.I have had Lord ]VAbernon&apos;s paper examined by the Customsand now circulate their report. I can find nothing to supportthe belief that increase of gravities is responsible for theincrease of drunkenness, nothing to lead to the belief thatthe Food controller&apos;a proposal would injuriously affect sobrietyand nothing to justify the maintenance of a restriction whichnow only affects a special class of Brewers.EC R F T.CABINET,CP. 625,(intlld.)   A.C.treasury, S.W.12th February, 192Q.
Average Gravity of Beer : Cabinet Paper 542.Note by the Board of Customs and Excise.1 ,   The proposal on which Lord DsAbernon commentsis that the restriction on the average gravity cf beerbrewed in the United Kingdom be removed (CP. 456).2.     There was no general restriction on gravitiesbefore the 1st April 1918, when maxima were fixed of **10300 for Great Britain and 10450 f0r Ireland.On l3t Jan.1919 thesewere jincreasedto 1032 &quot; &quot; 1047     &quot; &quot;On 1st. ]loApril a:.ter-1919 to     1040 &quot; &quot; ation   &quot; &quot;On 1 st.July1919 to     1044 &quot; &quot; 1051     &quot;3.     There were other restrictions imposed on thesupply of intoxicating drinks which were in operationearlier, and probably had a greater effect upondrunkenness than the restriction on beer gravities;for example, the total prohibition of the sale ofspirits in particular areas, curtailment of hours ofsale, discontinuity of drinking hours, and limitationof quantities jf beer,  spirits, and wine, which mightbe either produced or delivered for consumption.   Allof these have been relaxed, and Lord D!Abe.rnon has no
doubt this fact in mind in his attack on the presentproposal of the Pood Controller.   In an address whichLord D*Abernon delivered on the 14th October lastbefore the Society for the Study of Inebriety, he saidthat in 1915 and 1916,&apos;the decrease of Intemperance asmeasured by the statistics of drunkenness was out or allproportion to the reduction in consumption of alcoholicbeverages, and he drew the general conclusion that thequestion &quot;how the Nation drinks&quot; was more important thanthe question &quot;how much it drinks,&quot;    He also inferred thatif the modes and times and circumstances of drinking wereregulated on sound physiological lines, the amount of&quot;Iconsumption might with confidence be left within reasonablelimits to the operation of economic forces among which mightbe included appropriate taxation4.     Figures showing the fall and subsequent rise inconvictions for drunkenness in England and Wales in theyears 1913-1919 inclusive, are given on Appendix &quot;A&quot;.It will be observed that the diminution in drunkennessin 1915 and 1916,, to which Lord D&apos;Abernon here refers, as wellas the diminution in the year 1917,; occurred in spite of thefact that beer gravities in those years were not restricted.Moreover,, there is nothing in the figures to show, nor doesLord DfAbernon allege, that the increase in 1919 hasbeen due to any relaxation in beer gravities.   So far asit may have been due to the relaxation of restrictions atall, it is more likely, for the reason given above, to havebeen due to the removal of prohibition in certain cases.and of restrictions as to hours; and it is noteworthy thatthe
the increase did ryot extend to the Carlisle district(See Appendix &quot;B&quot;) which is under the Liquor ControlBoard1s management, although the brewers in that areahave taken advantage to a large extent of the previousrelaxations of gravity to which the Pood Controller refers0It is suggested, that&apos;a sufficient cause for the increasednumber of convictions for drunkenness can be found in thedemobilisation of the Forces and consequent return to thiscountry of some millions of young men, and the enforcedidleness or unemployment of persons who had recently beenengaged on War work and were loitering about the streetswith money in their pockets05c     As to Lord D&apos;&apos;Abemon?s opinion that the argumentthat strong beer prevents the use of spirits has no realsubstance, it may be remembered that a year ago,,- when theaverage gravity of beer was only 1G320 and the quantity of -spirits was restricted, much of the unrest of the time wasattributed to the shortage of spirits for which there wasan increased demand owing to the unsatisfying quality ofthe beer then obtainable.6*     An important fact in connection with thismatter is that the Thawing trade as a whole have notso far taken full advantage of the previous relaxations,and it is by no means certain that the removal of thepresent restrictions on gravity would lex.d to theproduction of stronger beer generally.     The actual averagegravity of all beer produced in the six months followingthe last rel\vral-v.lonvthat is 1st.July to 31st December, 1919,was 10390 for Great Britain, as against a permitted maximumof 1044^ and 1043Ofor Ireland as against a permitted&apos;
maximum of 1051 .7.-  Whilo the figures quoted justify the assumptionthat the existing restrictions on the gravity of &quot;beer &apos;have no pracUloal effect on the operations of the greatmajority of &quot;brewers, there is no room for doubt thatthey hamper the trade &quot;of the few individual brewingCompanies who before the War manufactured special beers.  . .  oand stouts of gravities of 1055   and over, mostly forbottling, inasmuch as these brewers are now unable tobrow more than a very limited quantity of these articles.Beers and stouts of this class are mostly consumed insaloon bars, hotels, reflfrjwaTXlifi and private housesand it may further&quot;be considered that their use hasvery little, if any,, connection with the question ofdrunkenness.     From t..c point of view of the brewersconcerned, the question of the unrestricted manufactureof these articles is cne of being allowed to resume theirpre-1918 established    trade in a high class article.8.   With regard to the question of profit, it may bethat hitherto the particular Companies now adverselyaffected have had little ground for complaint, as theFood Controller was in a position to relieve them of theactual brewing of their low gravity beers by a systemof transfer certificates under which such beers werebrewed on their behalf by other brewers in the districtswhere weak beers wore likely to be consumed - asystem which is no longer nossible.   Abstracts fromtheir last balance sheets are given in Appendix &quot;G&quot;,Innot reproduced.
in the cass of Allsopp and Yforthington the balancesarc made up for the year ended 30th September 1919,and in the case of Bass for the yoar ended 30th June1919,.    (These balance sheets are not a safe criterionas to profits under existing conditions for the reasonthat up to the 24th February 1919, that in9 for a largepart of the &quot;year covered by the balance sheet, theprioos of beer of a gravity exceeding 10340, and ofbeer in bottle, were not controlled, and very largeprofits which were considerably curtailed&apos; by the BeerPrices (and Description) OS3uor, 1919, dated 5th February,1919, were previously made on the sale of those beerseFurther the costs of manufacture and carriage haverecently increased&apos; very materially and the removal of all&apos;restrictions on quantity has not resulted in any increaseof output beyond that previously permitted.     Thepresent tendency is undoubtedly in the direction of a furthercurtailment of profits on beer and in the circumstancesthere does not appear to be any margin on which anadditional duty could be levied without increasing the costof beer to consumer*9C    Figures obtained from the Inland Revenue are alsogiven &quot;Appendix D)*jft&quot;    They show the upward tendency ofbrewers1 profits from 1912 to 1918, but these in themselvesthrow no light on the possibility of imposing an increasedduty at the present time.    Evidence would be necessarythat similar conditions still prevailed.     The Board hasno information on the value of premises *J.    not reproduced.
10,     Tho suggestion in Lord J)&apos;Abornonrs mo mo ran dun thatit was folly to have increased the Irish Gravity to itspresent lovol takes no account of the peculiar charactor ofthe Irish boor output, which is practically all black boor,that is to say, stout and porter.   Beer of this descriptioncannot be manufactured of a low gravity to bo drinkable,and it was for this reason, coupled with the fact that thegravity of Irish boor in pre-war times far exceeded thegravity for Great Britain&apos;, that when a maximum gravity came ,to be proscribed, different figures wore adopted forIreland and Groat Britain.&apos;    Tho cause of complaint as against/the higher Irish limit now lies with the few high-classbrewers above referred to, and although not so serious as itwas a year ago, is still vory real.&apos;  This grievance can onlyso that every brewer may be able to produce the articlebo met by removing all restrictions on gravity/on which thecharacter of his trade has boon built up, or by raisingtho British maximum to the same as tho Irish figure.
