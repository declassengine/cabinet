CONFIDENTIALI circulate for the information of mylieagues the accompanying Extracts froma Report, made by Vice-Admiral Sir John deRobeck, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,and High Commissioner, Constantinople,   ofproceedings since his departure from  Maltain &quot;IRON DUKE&quot; on 16th January, 1920.(Intlld.)   W. Ho L.19.2*20.
On Sunday 18th January 1920 I arrived at Port SIgriand met &quot;CENTAUR&quot; as arranged. &quot;IRON DUKE&quot; refuelled &quot;CENTAUR&quot;and I conferred with the High Commissioner concerning the SouthRussian situation, and arranged for him to proceed to Parisand London as quickly as possible.Sir Halford Mackinder gave me an account of the importantconversations lie had had in Warsaw, Bucharest and with H. MoCommissioner for Transcaucasia (whom &quot;CALYPSO&quot; had speciallybrought to Novorossisk) and General Denikin.He has achieved something like a common &quot;all round&quot;policy and in my opinion has rendered a most notable service aHe was able to inform me as to the general military situationon the Don front and was good enough to indicate the linesin which reconstruction of the country should be undertakenin rear of the line opposing the Bolsheviks *I had to observe that these projects so beneficial toRussia and so much to future British credit were only possibleif the Bolshevik advance was arrested and to secure this andthe establishment of his policy, active British interventionwas necessary for I believe that without our support theremay shortly be no territory for a British High Commissioner&apos;to control or guide *The general military situation at this time was asfollowsoOdessa.   Situation not satisfactory. General Schillingwas greatly distrusted by the British Military Mission thereand was not making sufficient efforts to hold the town   shouldit be attackedo   The Senior Naval Officer at Odessa consideredthe preliminary arrangements should be made for theevacuation of 50,000 of the inhabitants.CRIMEA *   General Slaschovf&quot;s troops were withdrawingto the line of the Perekop defences, which it was reportedwere being strengthened.   There was little fighting and onlypatrol skirmishese   General Slaschov was confident of holdingthe line provided he was given the necessary stores he hadasked for*DON KUBAN FRONT.      Rostov lost, but enemy so far hadfailed to&quot; cross the Don.   The Volunteer army appeared to berecovering their morale.   Tzaritzin army on line of Sal.NORTH CAUCASUS *   Bolsheviks occupied Kisliar.General Erdeli had been ordered to hold Petrovsk at all costsand had been authorised to treat with the AzerbaijanGovernment with a view to the Volunteer Caspian Flotillaproceeding to Baku in the event of Petrovsk fallingtThere was danger&apos; of North Caucasia becoming Bolshevikthus cutting off the Caspian flotilla, Petrovsk, and Denikin1&apos;soil supply.TRANS CASPIA.    The Bolsheviks had captured Merv9 andwerq attacking Krasnovodsk.The? coal and oil situation in South Russia was by thistime very acute and the lack of fuel was interfering   veryconsiderably with the operations in the field due to thedislocation of the transport arrangements and the lines ofcommunications, as the majority of the railways were blockedby engines without fuel.   Apart from this the sick and woundedwere suffering greatly as tho majority of the hospitals werewithout light or heating arrangements.
At 0500 GUT Wednesday 21st January, I arrived atNovorossisk, and conferred with General Sir&apos; George Milne,G,CJ&apos;oG., K.C.B,, D,Sg0., General Officer Commamin^-in-Chief-naiiwvuo, ^i^jo, i/uin-utsuuooi-ir-Lvu ui buy mgn uommissione r io:South Russia and Captain Charles D,Carpendaie, C.B., on boardH.H.S. &quot;BOTOW&quot; at which the following decisions were arrived at(a) Decided that S.S. &quot;PAlfluUA&quot; already sailed with roughly500 wounded should evacuate wounded to Malta insteadof Salonika^(b) It was noted that Russians. S. &quot;KSCHTA&quot; had alreadysailed with about 1,000 civilians 3?or Gunzulduk,Their papers wore reported as being in order by theRussian Authorities, but as they had not been vised bythe British it is unlikely the;/ will be allowed to landanywhere   Ho further action was possible regarding thisship for the present.(c) It was reported that 800 wounded wore on the point ofleaving Jiaterinodar.   Arranged that S.S, &quot;BRUffl&quot;should receive these and evacuate them to Constantinopleand Salonika,(d) Arranged that S.S.. &quot;HAICVlft&quot; should take .3,000 refugeesto destinations as on attached telegram, the passportsof   all these persons were being vised-by the Britishfor embarkation,(e) It was decided that all persons, civilian or militarymust before leaving Novorossisk get their passportsvised by the British.    General Keyes undertook toarrange for this,(f) It was agreed that it was highly desirable for theBritish Naval Transport Officer to control all sailingswhatever the nationality of the ship.   The British werealone able to say at what destination any ship could bereceived and tonnage would therefore be used to the bestadvantage.   This does not applt to ships sailing fromone Soufh Russian &apos;oort to another but only to ships&quot; leaving South Russia for an oversea destination;  theprocedure before sailing a ship to be as followsGeneral Keyes in the case of a refugee ship, andGeneral Percy in the case of an ambulance transport, toinform Captain of K*i.S. &quot;CONCORD&quot; that the ship wasready to sail and all requirements had been compliedwith; Captain of 11 CONCORD&quot; then to Instruct the NavalTransport Officer, Naval Transport Officer as usualbeing responsible that the ship was ready for sea andfuelled,(g) It was noted that in order to fully redeem Maekinder! sguarantee it might bo necessary in the future toevacuate refugees between the number of 8.000 and 20,000.It was strongly recommended arKi General Keyesundertook to&quot;give effect to this recommendation thatparties of refugees should  commence to be sent downfrom Htaterinodar forthwith in order to avoid a largecollection at tho last moment.
(h) It was made clear that the control of British shipping,and through the courtesy of the French Admiral, Frenchshipping as well., and the destination of Refugees orwounded lay in the hands of the High Commissioner,Constantinople, The Naval Coiiimander-in-Chief, and theGeneral Officer. Commanding^in-Chief, Army of theBlack Sea,As General Milne is proceeding in &quot;IRON DUKE&quot; toConstantinople and will from now therefore he in closetouch with Comnunder-in-Chief and High Commissioner! allquestions concerning evacuations from Novorossisk shouldBe referred by W/j? to Commander-in-Chief unless Iprevious instructions have been received.If Command er-In-Chief is kept informed in advance ofprobable movements of ships there will be no delay in  ideciding their destination. \(i) Naval Transport Officer was directed to prepare a list :of all vessels shown in order of their readiness forsea, and to render it to the Senior Naval Officer,(3)        It was decided that lieutenant Cross of the NavalTransport Office should take passage in S.S, &quot;HANOVER&quot;to assist the disembarkation at Constanza and Varna,(k)        The desirability of maintaining one collier atNovorossisk was noted and if possible this will bearranged-,(1)        It was decided to obtain confirmation of the offer of theSerbian Government to provide accommodation for10,000 refugees.General Wrangle whom I called on- was in command of themilitary defences of Novorossisk,  This officer is naturally adisappointed man, having fallen from the Command of an army inthe Field to the comparatively unimportant position he nowoccupies.   Considering the proneness of all Russians to intrigue,it is perhaps questionable whether he will give Denikin hiswholehearted support, though I understand he has asserted toSir Halford Nackinder that he will do so.There are few Russian troops in the town, and outsideon the hills lawlessness has much increased since my last visitwhen an exceedingly energetic Russian General was in commandhere and who has&quot;since been supersedod0   These bands of robberswho style themselves &quot;Green Guards&quot; attack and rob all whom theyare not afraid of outside about a three mile limit,,  ?A hoursafter &quot;IRON DUES?1 had left, a reconnaissance party of 150Russians and a British Officer were attacked and several wounded;they took refuge in a village about 7 miles away and were allrecovered by &quot;BBIBOW&quot; the. same night after the use of starshell and searchlights4Novorossisk is very much overcrowded by the thousandsof refugees who have- come in from Rostov, Taganrog, and othertowns recently evacuated,   There are many cases of typhus and inthis respect Novorossisk is not different from any other townthat we have visited for all are heavily stricken by this disease,I inspected the British Passport Bureau sot i.p by General Keyesand found this to be working admirably and smoothly.
I am sure that a good effect has been created byshowing our immediate readiness to give effect to Sin. K.Mackinders guaranteesAt 1700 G.M.T. on Friday 23rd January 1920, afterembarking General foilne and Staff, I proceeded zo Theodosiawhere I arrived at 0630 G.M.T. on Saturday 24th January,1920.Immediately on arrival I directed &quot;IRON DUKE&quot; todischarge 100 tons of coal from her bunkers Into a lighterwhich was placed alongside.   There was a complete lack of coalin the port and without this coal it was impossible for thework of the town and port to continueo The railways to thenorth were all blocked by cold engines, and therefore Iordered Mercedes to deliver as much, coal as she could duringa six hour stay at Theodosia before proceeding to Sevastopolwhere likewise there was no coal and a great demand for itfor all purposes *The town itself was in a very bad state botheconomically and from the point of view of morale, all seemedvery anxious as to the ability of the Volunteer Army tohold the Crimea.There was in addition to the lack of coal, and theconsequent lack of heat and light, a considerable lack ofwater.   Food was plentiful but was very expensive.There was a great deal of sickness in the town chieflytyphusj   there were also cases of enteric fever.A    The population of the town had increased from 50,000to  0,000 people due to the influx of refugees, some 3,000of whan were living in railway wagons.I arranged with the Base Commandant for the   Frenchhospital ship &quot;Peter the Great&quot; to call at the port andevacuate 400 cases of sick and wounded*The state of the hospitals was deplorableo 1500 casesof typhus, 600 more expected to arrive in a day or two.There was only accommodation for 1000 and surplus cases werebeing treated in sheds under the most insanitary conditionstIt was not possible to separate the wounded from the typhuscases as many of the wounded from the front arrived withtyphus * There was an acute shortage of medicines of all sorts,bandages, dressings, hospital bedding and soap,   &quot;iron Duke&quot;was able tc/provi&amp;e some of the most pressing necessities, butthe state of affairs revealed in South Russia requires imme-diate and comprehensive action on the part of Allied Red CrossAssociations (see my telegram No.823 Z of 23rd January 1920*)The condition of these Russians, many of whom had been fight-ing whilst others do nothing, was pitiable in the extreme,and I hope that some Immediate steps will be taken as theresult of the appeal made by General Milne and myself.I proceeded at 0030 G*M.T, on Sunday 25th January1920, In   IRON DUKE&quot; to Yalta to investigate the conditionsof that town and the number that would require to beevacuated should the peninsula be overrun by the Bolsheviks.The conditions here were much the same as Theodosia.except that there were fewer cases of typhuso   Great anxietywas apparent throughout the town, and large numbers of theinhabitants were very anxious to leave before the place wasfinally overrun?   These people number   it is estimated about15,000 but should evacuation become necessary it is considered5,000 only are compromised and require to be removed.   Inaddition/
5faddition to these there are 500 sick and wounded who musthe got away.iAt 1000 G.M.T. on the same day I proceeded toSevastopol in &quot;Iron Duke&quot; arriving at about 1430 G.M.T. in    -the afternoon.   Immediately after leaving Yalta the ther-     Imometer dropped and registered between 10 and 30 degrees of  Ifrost until after leaving Odessa., IShortly after my arrival, I was visited by General     \Subotin the Commander of the Portress of Sevastopol and        IAdmiral Neniukoff the Russian Naval Commander-in-Chief, whogave me a very frank exposition of the whole situation.-As a result of this coversation, corroborated byColonel Butlenj and of intelligence received by Captain of&quot;Marlhorough&quot; I came to the conclusion that the northerndefences of the Crimea might be broken at any moment, andthat if all those, who would be in danger at the hands ofthe Bolsheviks were to be saved, immediate steps were necess*rary to provide for evacuation by sea. \-Whilst &quot;IRON DUKE&quot; was at Sevastopol, a successfuladvance was made against the Bolsheviks who were drivenout of the Perekop region, but I regret that I am unable toconsider this anything more than a temporary advantage, forthere are not enough troops to resist a Bolshevik advancein force and now that the lakes are frozen the Volunteer Armyloses a great advantage that it has hitherto enjoyed. ColonelButler reported ; &quot;State of affairs most unsatisfactory.Estimated only 3000 men holding first line with a possible1500 available for  reserves.   Roads in Perekcp practicallyimpassable; transport almost -nil] men in front better thanthose in rear, but they are in a terribly unsatisfactorycondition.. Nothing has been done towards making main lineof defences * Lack of coal up the line causing complete stoppageof traffic; rolling stock bad, engines always breaking down; -complete lack of organisation^   General Slashoff no doubtgallant leader, but a man without military knowledge or powerto organise. Bolsheviks must succeed in breaking throughnorthern Crimea defences should they really try to do so.After this,&quot; neither troops, defences, nor organisation, willprevent the&apos;occupation of the whole of the Crimea by theBolsheviks.&quot;At the time of writing &quot;Mercedes&quot; is discharging about;2000 tons of coal, but there is little doubt that the bulkof Russian officers feel in their hearts that the situation .is irretrievable, though it is the simple fact that the rein.?forcement of the Perekop line by another two or threethousand men, decently armed, and willing to fight, would con^erlthe position into one of absolute security, :;;Should Sevastopol fall I calculate from allsources of-Information that we shall have to take away about 2000 sickand wounded, and from 8*-i0,000 refugees, i.e., personsdangerously compromised with the Bolsheviks.The general result of this cruise has been to  ascertainthe military situation ofa the Don front, the Crimean front, \ \and in the Odessa district; to provide for the urgent medicA) ;requirements at all the principal South Russian Ports, toarrange for the distribution of fuel to fairly meet the most;   ;urgent requirements; to Investigate and set up a system ofpassport control should a general evacuation be necessary;to arrange for a service of ships from Novorossisk in orderto comply with the Macklnder guarantee; to collect transportsand hospital ships at Sevastopol so that in the event of theCrimean defences being penetrated all sick, wounded and,compromised persons may be embarked before they fall into thehands/
the hands of the Bolsheteiks.I have only to add the opinion already expressed in mytelegram to Their Lordships 856 Z of 28th January 1920, thata very small amount of active Allied support would render un-necessary the elaborate and expensive   measures that I have hadto take to save the lives of thousands of innocent persons. Wemust be prepared to transport by sea, house, feed, and generallymaintain for an indefinite period perhaps 50,000 persons in all,whilst it is my belief, which is shared by General Milne, thatthe despatch of two or three British battalions would renderallthis unnecessai^y, and the list tor course would rebound to ourhonour and credit, and more truly advance the   cause of a regen-erated Russia than the policy we are now pursuing.I enclose herewith extracts from reports which I havereceived indicating briefly some of the causes to which thecollapse of the Volunteer Army may be attributable.
999O a) e)CONFIDENTIAL.Enclosure to Med, No. Z. 131/6589 of 30th January, 1920CAUSES OF COLLAPSE OF VOLUKTBB ARMY.1.    The main reasons for the disaster which has befallenthe Armed Forces of South Russia are(a) The vastly superior forces thrown into theline by the enemy.(b) The improvement in the enemyfs organisation,equipment and methods due to German assistance,(c) The deplorable effect of ministerial utteranceson the morale of the Russian Army.2.    It is officially estimated that the Bolsheviks putapproximately 500,000 men&apos; into the Southern front since June1919c       The Armed Forces of South Russia had at most250,000 men and since the opening of the Bolshevik attacksat OREL these have been dwindling rapidly and at present theynumber only about 7,000,3,    There is at last a small amount of reliable evidencethat fiermany is assisting the. Bolsheviks.General Holman and other Officers who have recentlyreturned from the Front report that the enemy2s militaryorganisation has improved considerably in the last Fix months,and that their battle tactics appear to be developing onGerman lines,     : Artillery fire in sectors, and artillery andmachine gun combination were noted in &quot;the attack onILLOVAISKAYA.       The Cavalry are well mounted, and wellturned out;       they also are following recognised Germanmethods in their tab ticso       These troops were welldisciplined at first, but at ILL07AISKAYA the Russiantemperament overcame German discipline and after shooting afew captured Officers they commenced looting the trains in.the station and became to&apos; a certain extent demoralised.    Itremains to he seen whether German influence is sufficientlypowerful to overcome Russian laxity, and. on this very largelydeoends the fate of the Volunteer Army, -4,    Further, a wagon containing German telegraph andtelephone instruments captured near KONOTQP.      (BritishMilitary Mission, Intelligence Section.)5.    The effect of certain speeches by prominent states-men at home on the Morale of the Volunteer Army has: beenmost deplorableo    Even Officers in high commands weregreatly affected by it,, General VRANG3L himself wasdumbfounded and his whole outlook changed in a few days.He thought of nothing except the possibility of saving hiswife and family and asked &quot;that, as a personal favour to himcertain messages might be sent to his relations at Yalta andthat the Commander ^in-Chief might be asked to give them apassage to Novorossisk where he would meet them.       Thisattitude was reflected throughout the Volunteer Army.     Afew of the oldest and best officers remain with their menand now form part of the &quot;Volunteer Corps&quot; (four divisions)which is all that remains of the &quot;Volunteer Army&quot;.  For theremainder.......
remainder of the Officers considerej. ffchat they were beingabandoned by England in the hour of their greatest ne9d andthey knew that if they,&apos; or their wives and &quot;families, fellinto the hands of the&apos; Bolsheviks they were certain to bekilled and possibly tortured.       &apos;7ith one accord theofficers left their post and proceeded to collect theirfamilies and are trying to       them to Novorossisk, wherethey hope England will&quot;still protect them.        The men  -though undefeated could do nothing without Officers and areroaming back through the country like sheep without ashepherd.General VRANGEL further stated to General Holmanthat he considered that England was in honour bound torescue the wives and families of the Officers who haveremained loyal.6.    For the reason? given above it is now certain thatthe Armed Forces of South ftussia are splitting into twoparties in addition to the interminable petty&quot;quarrels andjealousies which always continue.        But now there aredefinitely a pro-ally anti-German party lead by Denikin, andan anti-ally pro-German party at present without a leader.Denikin1s party are the best&apos;men in Russia and have nothingbut the interests of their country at heart.     But the pro-German fjarty are the worst elements of the Volunteer OfficersThey think of nothing but themselves, care nothing for their,men, and spend all their time in cafes, intriguing to obtainassistance from Germany which they hope will mean&quot;arestoration of the old&apos; state of affairs, the recovery oftheir property and the possibilities of their resuming theirpre-war life of pleasure.     There are, however, a number ofofficers of pro-German tendencies from entirely unselfishand patriotic motives because they think that Germany isable to help them more easily and more effectively than GreatBritain.    &quot;   These officers&apos; are increasing in numbersbecause there are many Eussian Officers hitherto undoubtedlypro-British who have oeen disillusioned by political state-ments, and being&apos; firmly convinced that Great Britain intendsto desert them how turn toward  Germany for the assistancewhich they must have&quot;to restore peace and order in Russia,It is estimated that the pro-Germany party include 75% ofthe;officers remaining in the Armed Forces of South Russia,
