General.Nil.Part II. Departmental.The Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme.Steady progress continues to be made in the operation of the scheme for completingthe training of apprentices whose course was interrupted by service with the Forces.Since the beginning of October, 1919, at which date attention was last directed to thesubject in this Report, negotiations have been concluded which have further extendedthe scope of the scheme. Seven special schemes adapted to various new industries orbranches of industry have been put into operation, bringing the number of these schemesto 40. At the same time the field of operation of some of the schemes already in existencehas been extended. Thus, for example, apprentices in the sporting gun industry haverecently been brought under the scheme for the engineering industry, as have also -appreh-tices to pen tool making. The scope of the General Scheme, applicable at the discretionof the Minister to trades for which no special arrangements are considered desirable, hasalso been broadened considerably. Within the last few weeks apprentices to umbrellamaking and repairing, picture frame making and gilding, and wire drawing, have beenaccepted as eligible for renewed training under the General Scheme.(c 1961)  iso  2/20  h &amp; s K
The number of applications received from apprentices by the department continuesto rise rapidly.   For some time past, approximately 1,000 applications have been receivedeach week.   On the 23rd September, nearly 18,900 apprentices had made applicationthrough the Employment Exchanges to be brought under the scheme.  This number willvery shortly have been doubled, the number of applications received up to the 26thJanuary, the latest date for which statistics are available, being over 34,500.   By the4th February, the number of agreements between apprentices, and employers transmittedto the headquarters of the department for approval, which stood at over 28,000, was morethan twice the total at the beginning of October.   Grants have been sanctioned for thecompletion of training in nearly 26,400 cases, and the number of employers acceptingapprentices under the terms of the scheme is not far short of a thousand.   By far thegreater number of the apprentices returning from the Forces who make application underthe scheme are in a position to return to their pre-war employers.   Less than 4,000 outof the 34,500 applying at the Exchanges have asked for training with employers other thanthose who employed them before the war.   Some little difficulty has been presented bythis fact, but the general shortage of apprentices in many important industries has induceda number of firms to express their readiness to find positions for apprentices not formerlyin their employment, and the department have, in the great majority of cases, been ableto make satisfactory arrangements for apprentices returning from the Forces who findthat their former positions are no longer available.   The engineering industry still accountsfor the largest number of apprentices resuming training under the scheme, the total forthe industry standing at over 9,000.   The building industry, with over 4,500, ranks next,while the printing industry, for which separate schemes are in operation in England andScotland, accounts for a total of over 4,100.Serious difficulties in putting the scheme in operation have been very few.   Theposition in the Scottish building trades, where at one time a fairly general opposition wasoffered.by employers to the introduction of a scheme which, it was contended, did notmake sufficient allowance for special Scottish needs, has improved considerably.   Afternegotiations with the Joint Industrial Council for the industry with the object of securingmodifications of the scheme had failed, the Scottish master joiners found themselvesconfronted at the close of last year by a strike in support of the apprentices&apos; claims.  Theyconsequently reconsidered their position and decided to adopt the scheme.  A similarsituation in the Scottish electrical contracting industry still awaits a final solution.   Theunions concerned have for some time been finding difficulty in preventing their membersfrom striking in support of the apprentices, and it would appear not improbable therefore,that the scheme may be accepted by employers in this industry as well.  Other difficultieshave been occasioned, mainly in outlying parts of the country, by the fact that apprentices1&apos;wages have been in the past on a level considerably below those for which provision wasmade in the Government schemes, and that, in consequence, a number of firms pleadinability to face the expense of training their apprentices under the scheme.   Difficultiesof this nature have been specially noticeable in the country districts of the South-WesternDivision, and to some extent in. the North of Scotland.   The full application of the scheme,has, however, been brought about only by persistent canvassing on the part of the localofficials of the department, since many firms, in their preoccupation with the largerproblems of resettlement, were inclined to let the claims of the returning apprentices slipinto the background.The general results of the scheme, so far as its operation can be fairly judged in soshort a period, would appear to be good. Eeports from local officials, who have been ableto maintain a tactful supervision of the nature of the training given and the progress ofthe apprentices, show that there is little to complain of either as to the quality of thetraining afforded, or the readiness of the apprentices to take advantage of the opportu-nities afforded them. Some few complaints have been received on either side of theparties to the bargain, and some trouble has been experienced in providing the instructionin technical institutes which often forms a part of the apprentices&apos; training. But diffi-culties of this nature are so infrequent that they may be counted practically negligible.In its immediate object of saving returning apprentices from becoming semi-skilled orunskilled workers the scheme may already be pronounced successful, while in additionit has helped to concentrate attention on the important question of apprenticeship ingeneral.
War Criminals.The difficulties which are reported to have arisen with the German Government in thecarrying out of those clauses^ in the Treaty of Peace with Germany which provide forthe surrender to the Allied Governments of &quot; war criminals,&quot; are.noticed in the &quot; NewStatesman &quot; and the &quot; Nation.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; argues that the whole validityof the Treaty may be tested on this issue. It is suggested that the provisions of the Treatycan. be enforced in this respect only by military action against the German Government,and it is maintained that the French and British Governments do not possess moral powerover their own peoples sufficient to enable them to enforce these sections of the Treaty bysuch means. &quot; This country will supply no further troops for the occupation of freshareas in Germany.&quot; On this basis the &quot; New Statesman &quot; generalises, and propoundsthe theory that the Treaty remains effective and valid just in so far as the people ofEngland and France are willing to enforce it. The Treaty, in the opinion of this paper,may in fact be revised by the German Government^ fulfilling, or refusing to fulfil, thesuccessive provisions of the Treaty, according as they judge the Allied Governments aresupported by their peoples. The &quot; Nation &quot; argues that these clauses are not providedfor in the &quot; 14 points &quot; and therefore ought not to be in the Treaty of Peace. The leadersof Liberalism and Labour are urged to bestir themselves &quot; to combat an injustice which isalso a danger.&quot; &apos;Second (Berne) International.The discussions at many I.L.P. divisional conferences on the attitude that party oughtto adopt towards the Second and Third Internationals are reflected in the &quot; New States-man &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; expresses the opinion thatit is no longer possible to unite all the socialist bodies in one international body, in viewof the fact that, in many countries, the conflict between the various Socialist sectionshas led to bloodshed. Therefore, in its opinion, the Second International must fail tosatisfy the hopes which its reconstitution aroused, In the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; it isboldly stated that the I.L.P. cannot continue its affiliation with this International.  It is* Reported in &quot; The Times,&quot; 31st ult.t Reported in &quot; The Times,&quot; 16th ult.% Section 228-230 of the Treaty of Peace.IG 1961) K 2Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.International Finance.The more startling movements in the American exchange took place too late forproper notice in the papers reviewed this week. The Labour Leader &quot; contains acharacteristic article written in general terms on the economic condition of Europe. It isassumed that current rates of exchange are good evidence of the financial standing of thecountries concerned, and it is concluded that Europe in general is in a state of financialand economic ruin, while in particular the enemy countries and the new States set up underthe Treaties of Peace are actually bankrupt. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; believes that hadpeace been concluded by negotiation in the autumn of 1916, the economic problem wouldhave been comparatively a simple one ; and the tone of the article is one of self-congratula-tion for the attitude taken up by the I.L.P. at that time towards the German peace over-tures. The &quot; Nation &quot; reiterates its thesis that the statesmanlike course for America toadopt is to give financial help to Europe only upon terms. This paper believes thatAmerica could very well use its comparatively secure financial position as a means bywhich to dictate a revision of the Peace Treaties. Perhaps under the influence of thesesuggestions of the &quot; Nation,&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; interpretsthe letter of the Secretary to (the U.S.A. Treasury* as an ultimatum to the Allies to revisethe economic and financial clauses of the Treaties of Peace and to put an end to armaments.Mr. Glass&apos; letter hardly bears this interpretation. The &quot; Nation &quot; combines the proposalsadvanced in the Memorandum! presented to various Governments on the internationaleconomic situation and the counter-recommendations of, Mr. Glass, and thus arrives at acomprehensive list of remedial measures. The proposals advocated are the cancellationof debts as between the Allied and Associated States, the financing of the weaker nations,whether enemies or allies, by means of international credits, disarmament, revision of the *economic provisions of the Peace Treaty and the deflation of European currencies.&quot; Justice &quot; emphasizes the effect an adverse American exchange must have upon thecourse of food prices in. this country.
objected, however, to the Moscow body that its first meeting was not representative andthat the programme it formulated was not properly international. The principle is laiddown that the people in each country must be left free to decide each their own form ofGovernment. Should this principle be insisted upon it is obvious that the I.L.P. cannotlegitimately join the Third International unless the latter is willing to modify its absolutedoctrine on forms of government.The Political Situation.The Paisley by-election is the subject of little comment this week except in &quot; Forward,&quot;which is naturally indulging in much propaganda in support of Mr. Biggar. The &quot; LabourLeader &quot; gives full publicity to Mr. Biggar&apos;s election address, and Mr. Philip Snowdenargues from Mr. Asquitlfs actions when Prime Minister that many of his election declara-tions should be discounted. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; complains that Mr. Asquith, inadvocating the cessation of Government borrowing and the &quot; maintenance &quot; of publicexpecjjture on health and education, has not faced the facts. This paper is an advocateof Government loans for such things as housing and the coal industry, and of greaterannual expenditure on the civil services. The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks that the ex-PrimeMinister had made-&quot; a pretty consistent stand for Liberalism as a creed against a bureau-cratic Socialism and a protectionist Imperialism,&quot; but the enthusiasm of this paper forMr. Asquith is not too marked. With regard to the new Parliamentary session, the&quot; Labour Leader &quot; trusts that the opposition will prove more successful than last session,and outlines a list of topics which the Parliamentary Labour Party ought to press forward.These are : Russia, Ireland, Egypt, India, the Peace Treaties, Finance and Nationalisation.It will be noticed how foreign affairs-the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; treats Indian and Irishquestions as problems of foreign rather than of imperial policy predominate in thiscatalogue. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the financial situation as it confronts theGovernment. It believes that press discussions hostile to increased expenditure on socialreform and on the international economic position alternate according to a plan of campaign,inspired by &quot; politicians and financiers,&quot; which has for its purpose avoidance of a capitallevy. This paper urges that a distinction in these matters should be drawn between theGovernment and the nation. It does not believe the nation to be bankrupt, but is willingto admit the insolvency of the present administration. A Labour Government, however,it is claimed, would be in a much more favourable position.The Industrial Situation.The &quot; New Age &quot; contains this week one of its periodic reviews of the miners&apos;&apos;agitation for the nationalisation of the coal mines. It is stated that the effect of thecampaign on the minds of the public has been little or nothing, and the suspicion isexpressed that in this matter Mr. Smillie is merely acting as a political agent for the LabourParty. The &quot; New Age &quot; is equally severe in discussing the railway settlement. Theaddition of representatives of the railwaymen&apos;s unions to the Railway Advisory Committeeis regarded as an illusory concession humiliating to the railwaymen (.&quot; illiterate coolieswould be dissatisfied with less &quot;), and the sliding scale part of wages agreement is especiallycondemned. The &quot; New Age &quot; is thus dissatisfied with two members of the Triple Allianceand does not mention the third. Much more hopeful, in its opinion, than the policies ofthe N.U.R. and the M.F.G.B. are the Manchester Building Guild Committee&apos;s scheme,the Wigan plan for municipal currency notes and the Bradford proposal of a municipalbank. The Building Guild Committee receives full consideration, and it is argued that theadoption of its proposals will give, for the first time, concrete form to certain economictheories, such as the solidarity of labour as an economic organisation, and the bargainingequality of Labour and Capital. These theories, however, the &quot; New Age &quot; points out,have always been treated by Guild Socialists as axiomatic and it is recognised, therefore,that the Building Guild may prove yet to be a diversion from the path of progress or even abackward step. The welcome which is extended towards these proposals may thereforebe taken to be a result of disillusionment with the Triple Alliance. This disillusionmentis no new feature of that part of the Labour and Socialist Press which is detached from theofficial Labour movement. The &quot; Nation &quot; favourably refers to the proceedings of theCourt of Inquiry into the claims of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation andjudges that the proceeding will be less sensational than those of the Coal Industry Corn-mission. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; outlines the factors at work in the movement amongorganisations of professional workers towards federation. In its view there are threegroups of opinion among professional workers: those who * would have professionalworkers recognised as a &quot; third party &quot; in industry ; those who fully adhere to the formula&apos; Labour of hand and brain &quot; ; and those who, while sympathetic towards Labour, wish
to preserve their independence until at least Labour is more sympathetic towards them-The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that a union of any two of these groups would controlthe proposed professional workers&apos; federation; and the object of last Saturday&apos;s Conferencewas obviously to secure a control by the two latter groups. It is interesting to note thatMr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; regards this conference as an attempt on thepart of the Labour Research Department to organise professional workers industriallyand politically. Mr. Snowden cannot have observed the communique from this bodydisclaiming any such intention.Wages and the Cost of Living.The discussion in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; on the sliding scale provisions in therailway settlement, which was begun by Mr. Cramp last week, is continued this week byMessrs. W. A. Mainwaring and W. W. Craik, of the Central Labour College, who jointlysign an article on the subject. No more than Mr. Cramp do they discuss the actualprovisions of the scale and the details of the method by which the cost of living index numberis determined. Mr. Cramp last week dwelt upon the virtues of an ideal sliding scale fromthe point of view of the Trade Union organiser, and was thus easily able to arrive at afavourable opinion. Messrs. Mainwaring and Craik look at the question from the pointof view of the class-war. In this class-war the conflict between masters and men admitsof no compromise and of no peace by negotiation : either the masters must win or the men.If the men win, they have no use for wage-systems at all; so long as the masters havethe upper hand, they will keep wages at a minimum, upon whatever method the wagesare determined. The leaders of the Central Labour College are not, therefore, greatlyinterested in the differences between the various wage-systems and do not, indeed, troubleto distinguish between sliding scales based on the general cost of living and those basedon the selling price of particular commodities.* Their great objection to sliding scales isapplicable to all varieties ; &quot; they perpetuate a state of mind that acquiesces in a re-duction of wages without a struggle ; . . . unrestricted fieedom of movement is indis-pensable.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; makes criticisms on the sliding scale provisions of the railwayagreement similar to those of Messrs. Bevin and Henderson.f The agreement is regardedas an innovation fatal to all economic progress and as great a landmark in the movementtowards the &quot; servile state &quot; as the Insurance Act of 1911.Part IV. General Topics.. The General Situation.During the past week an altogether abnormal number of conferences of all ku\dshave taken/place in connection with various important labour matters. The ParliamentaryCommittee of the Trades Union Congress has completed its annual tour of the GovernmentDepartments and has had conferences with Ministers with regard to important labour issuesaffecting their Departments. A deputation of the Parliamentary Committee also discussedthe Unemployment Insurance Bill with the Minister of Labour. Several other conferencesof Labour bodies have taken place. The Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation have met toconsider further the question of coal profits and the cost of living, and an importantconference of. non-manual workers has been held to promote the formation of a federationof professional associations. The Court of Inquiry with regard to the wages and con-ditions of dock and waterside labour has continued, vand an important conference ofemployers and workpeople in the engineering trade has been in session in York, while anational conference of building trade operatives at Manchester has registered its finalopposition to dilution in the building trade. The issue of greatest importance in theLabour world continues to be the nationalisation of the mines. The miners have broughtthe campaign in the country to a close, and will in the next week or two carry on theirpropaganda in Parliament in order to prepare the ground as completely as possible forany decision that may be reached at the forthcoming special Trades Union Congress.The general nationalisation situation is discussed in some detail below.Survey of Industrial Disputes.The industrial history of the week has been marked in the main not by the outbreakof fresh, disputes but by the settlement of old ones.  Agreements and settlements, some* For example, the sliding scales in the coal industry and some parts of the iron ,and steel industry,f Of. Report 21st ult., p. 37.
reached as the result of dispute and others by amicable negotiations, have been reportedin a large number of industries. The most important of these settlements are the nationalagreement in the wholesale clothing trade and the agreement with regard to the wagesof road transport workers in Scotland. On several important industrial issues negotiationsare proceeding, an important programme of reforms in wages and hours has been putforward by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation on behalf of men engaged in bun-kering vessels at cross-Channel ports and working on canals, and the Amalgamated.Union of Operative Bakers has made a demand for a national advance of 15s. per week.A serious interference at the moment with the normal progress of industry is dueto a lock-out of operative painters in Yorkshire as a result of sectional strikes. Otherwise,apart from one or two minor and local strikes, the industrial situation is untroubled bystoppage of work.The Unempbyment Position.The number of persons on out-of-work donation and unemployment benefit at the30th January shows a further substantial reduction during the week.. The H.M. Forcespolicies lodged were 377,116 as compared with 385,365 on the 23rd January, a reductionof 8,249. The number of unemployment books remaining lodged was 127,476 malesand females, compared with 135,636 at the 23rd January. A slight increase in femaleunemployment books is balanced by a decline of 8,500 males. The improvement inemployment is chiefly noticeable in engineering and ironfounding, and building and worksof construction. The live register at the employment exchanges at the 30th January also&apos;reflects the reduction in employment. The live register at the 30th January showed478,173 men, 52,479 women and 27,556 juveniles. This represents a reduction in thelive registers during the week of 22,847 men, 487 women and 1,921 juveniles.The Nationalisation of the Mines.A further stage has been reached in the long-continued campaign of the miners tosecure the nationalisation of the mines. Eepresentatives of the Miners&apos; Federation ofGreat Britain accompanied the deputation from the-Parliamentary Committee of theTrades Union Congress, which waited on the Prime Minister on the 5th February, tosubmit to him the resolutions passed by the special Trades Union Congress on nationalisa-tion and other subjects. On the following day the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federationdecided that, in view of the answer given by the Prime Minister to the effect that theGovernment were not prepared to give legislative effect to the Majority Report of theCoal Commission, they should ask the Parliamentary Committee to convene the specialadjourned Trade Union Congress at the earliest possible date in order to give effect to theresolution passed at the last special Congress and also at the annual Congress at Glasgow.It will be remembered that the special Congress in December decided to defer a decisionuntil an adjourned Congress to be held after the reassembling of Parliament, and thatit pledged itself at this. Congress to call upon the trade union movement to give effect toClause (c) of the nationalisation resolution of the Glasgow Congress, i.e., to decide the formof action to be taken to compel the Government to accept the Majority Report of theCommission. The Parliamentary Committee will meet on the 18th February and willmake arrangements for the summoning of the special Congress in accordance with therequest of the miners.There is no doubt that the Trades Union Congress will at any rate outwardlycontinue firm in its determination that the mines should be nationalised. But thecrux of the question is still the &quot; form of action&quot; to be taken to secure this, andthis is the really important thing, because there are &quot; forms of action&quot; to obtainnationalisation that would amount to nothing more than covering a retreat. So faras opinions likely to be openly expressed go, there is little more agreement inthe Labour movement now than there was in September. The miners have strengthenedtheir case by their policy of attempting to obtain in the first place the effectiveassistance of the whole Labour movement, and in the second place the sympathy of thegeneral public by means of their educational campaign. They have sought to convincethe rest of the labour world and the public that their interests as consumers of coal&apos;willbe advanced by nationalisation, and they are at present showing great solicitude for thepublic in their demands for the reduction in the price of industrial coal and an increasein the supply of domestic coal. How far they have,been successful, however,,remainsto be seen, and in respect to exclusiveness they have a good deal to live down. On thewhole it seems doubtful whether their campaign has had any appreciable effect in makingan abstract issue like nationalisation into a practicable one for a strike on a large scale..
Further, the trade union movement as a whole has no desire at present for anything ofthe nature of a general strike, and in particular the railwaymen and the transport workershave good reasons at the moment for wishing to avoid such an eventuality.In the meantime the campaign has been transferred from the country to Parliament.The Mines for the Nation Campaign closed on the 8th February, and a meeting of theCampaign Committee is being held this week to receive the report on the campaign andto make recommendations with regard to future action. In Parliament the Labour Partyhas taken the first opportunity to raise the question. Mr. Adamson, in his speech on the10th February, insisted that nationalisation was the claim of the miners, and it was alsothe claim of the Labour Party and of the united Labour movement in the country. Onthe 11th February Mr. Brace moved, as the chief Labour amendment to the Address, thefollowing :-&quot; But regrets the absence of any proposal to nationalise the coal mines ofthe country on the lines recommended by a majority of the members of the Royal Corn-mission on the Coal Industry, which was appointed for the purpose of advising theGovernment on the best methods of reorganising the industry in order to secure economyin management, greater safety in working, and maximum output.&quot;The Nationalisation of the Railways.It is stated by the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; that a movement has been started for a greatcampaign for the nationalisation of the railways. This is quite at variance with thetruth, but it may be mentioned, for what it is worth, that the King&apos;s Cross No. 1 Branchof the National Union of Railwaymen has passed a resolution declaring that the railwaysare not now being worked for the benefit of the community, that the present system iswasteful and extravagant, and that the time has arrived when effect should be given tothe many resolutions passed by the Union demanding nationalisation. &quot; We are con-vinced,&quot; continues the resolution, &quot; that only by nationalisation will the community obtaina cheap and efficient transport service and the railway, workers a fair wage.&quot; Otherbranches are asked to consider the resolution and to notify the secretary of King&apos;s CrossNo. 1 Branch of their decision. In the event of branch decisions justifying such a course,King&apos;s Cross No. 1 Branch proposes to convene a conference to instruct the Executiveimmediately to set the campaign in motion. It may be noted also that Mr. C. W.Bowerman, M.P., who presided at the meeting of protest against the London TrafficCombined Bill on the 7th February, maintained that,.if the railways did not pay, theonly remedy was to nationalise the whole of the railway systems of the country; andit may be expected that this view will frequently be expressed in the next few weeks inconnection with the attempt of the Traffic Combine to increase fares on the undergroundrailways.Control of the Liquor Trade.A conference convened by the York Trades and Labour Council and the York LabourParty to discuss the question of public ownership and control of the liquor trade was,addressed on the 7th February by Mr. Arthur Greenwood, joint secretary of the LabourCampaign Committee which is conducting this movement. A resolution was unanimouslycarried giving the adhesion of the conference to the principle, and urging the Governmentto take the opportunity in its forthcoming legislation to eliminate the private interests ofthe trade, and to establish public ownership and control. This campaign was inauguratedat Carlisle on the 8th November, 1919 (see this Report for 12th November, 1919,page 407), but it does not appear to have been prosecuted with any vigour.The Policies of the Miners and the Railwaymen.It is instructive as a study in industrial strategy to compare the attitude of therailwaymen with regard to the London Traffic Combined Bill* with the policy adoptedby the miners in connection with nationalisation. The railwaymen are now quite definitelyplacing their own interests before those of labour in general. In order that they mayreceive higher wages they are supporting the raising of prices of the cost of transportto the public, and especially the labour section of it. The railwaymen have, throughout,shown themselves unwilling to consider the interests of labour generally, and their actionat the time of the national strike in taking extreme measures without consulting the bodieswith which they were closely associated seriously strained their relations with the labourmovement in general and with the miners and transport workers in particular.See page 78 below.
The policy of the railwaymen in this case is noteworthy because it is one in which theinterests of the worker in the particular industry are most likely to come into conflictwith the interests of labour as a whole. In an ordinary industry, the raising of wages inthat industry does not immediately affect labour in general, or, as it may be put, labouras consumer, but in the case of the railwaymen increases of wages and decreases inhours, it has been admitted by the railwaymen themselves, must have a direct effecton prices, and this effect is immediately felt by labour in general. The case of theLondon Traffic Combined Bill is interesting as the first clear emergence as a definiteissue on a considerable scale of a conflict between labour as consumer and one of itssections.&quot; Workers&apos; Control in the Coal Mining Industry.&apos;&apos;1Mr. Frank Hodges has written a pamphlet with the above title in which he states thecase for self-government in the coal mining industry. He begins by admitting the achieve-ments of private enterprise, but points out that in 1913 the output ceased to expand andcapitalism began to break down. He declares that the most remarkable of all the factorsin the decline of production is the growing consciousness of the workers that all is not wellin the industry, that the men have been bereft of anything like a voice in the direction ofthe industry. Mr. Hodges maintains that until the desire of the men for effective controlof the industry secures adequate expression, the output will not materially increase.&quot; Output,&quot; he says, &quot; will never reach the pre-war level until avenues are provided forthis desire now so manifest among men in the industry.&quot; Mr. Hodges maintains that theminers&apos; claim for the control of industry is neither anti-social nor syndicalist in character ;.and he upholds it not as Guild Socialism, but as a step towards a Guild.Unemployment Insurance BillA conference took place between the Minister and a deputation from the ParliamentaryCommittee of the Trades Union Congress on the 5th February to consider the provisionsof this Bill.  The deputation was headed by Mr. Will Thome, M.P., who stated that theParliamentary Committee had consulted the trade unions, and that a large number of.amendments had been suggested by these unions in addition to their fundamental objectionto the whole scheme of contributory insurance.   He stated that the Parliamentary Com-mittee itself was in favour of a non-contributory scheme, and in this connection he drewattention to the recommendations of the fcrade union side of the National IndustrialConference which, he maintained, formed a representative expression of trade union opinion,on the matter.   He suggested that unemployment insurance should be paid for by a levyon industry which might either be conveyed to a common pool from which all benefitswere paid, or might be held in each industry with the provision that each industry shouldbear the responsibility for its own unemployment.   He maintained that the amount ofcapital invested in industry in the country was so great that the ten million odd required to-pay unemployment insurance was such a small percentage of it that it would hardly be felt.If, however, the Government was not prepared to accept a non-contributory scheme, it wouldbe necessary to fall back on the scheme suggested in the Bill.   He then went on to advancecertain criticisms of the Bill itself.  He maintained that the amount of benefit providedfor in the Bill was insufficient in view of the increase in the price of commodities, anddrew attention to the hardship involved in the provision of a waiting period during whichthe workpeople could not receive unemployment benefit.  He objected that the 5 per cent.,allowed by the Bill for the administrative expenses of trade unions in those cases in whichthe unions themselves administered the scheme was insufficient, and stated that the tradeunions would prefer that their actual administrative expenses should be met apart fromany percentage basis.  But if.this were not considered possible he suggested that 10 percent, should be granted for administrative expenses, partly in view of the fact that theunions in paying out benefit would for some time be losing interest on their funds.  He alsosuggested that the actuarial estimate that the rate of unemployment in general labourunions would be 10 per cent, was excessive and dealt at length with the grievance that wasfelt in connection with the clause which disqualifies an insured contributor who has lostemployment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factoryor workshop at which he was employed.  Other objections to the Bill were advanced byother members of the deputation and Mr. R. B. Walker stated that agricultural labdurerswished to be included in the Bill provided that they were allowed a lower rate of contribu-tion in view of the low rate of unemployment in their industry.  After some discussion,Mr. Walker promised to consider the practicability of the suggestion that agriculture mightcontract out of the general scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  TheMinister dealt with the objections which had been raised by the deputation.
Unemployment Insurance in the Woollen Industry.In connection with unemployment insurance it is interesting to note that the Wooland Allied Joint Industrial Council is at present preparing a scheme to provide againstunemployment and under-employment in that industry. The industry is prepared toadminister this scheme if it can establish its claim to contract out of the national scheme.The industry through its representatives on the Board of Control of Wool Textile Productionand later on the Wool and Allied Joint Industrial Council has very definite views on thesubject of unemployment and under-employment. It is maintained that under-employ-ment rather than unemployment, short-time and delays arising from one cause and another,are the real problem in this industry, and it is contended that the national scheme does notmake any attempt to deal with, this problem. The industry also maintains that it isable to afford a more generous contribution than the State would be likely to make, and itcontemplates a maximum benefit of 25s. a week for unemployment in the case of males.This industry has for long been contemplating a special measure for dealing with unemploy-ment and under-employment. In 1916 a deputation from the employers&apos; and workers&apos;side submitted a case to the Board of Trade with a view to securing the right to contractout of the national scheme. Early in 1918 in order to provide against prospective unem-ployment and under-employment a committee was appointed by the Board of Control ofWool Textile Production for the purpose of considering a levy scheme. The danger ofunemployment, however, passed away and the scheme was not actually brought intooperation.Courts of Inquiry.  -The Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act into the application by theNational Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard minimum wage of 16s. per dayand other alterations in the conditions of employment of dock and waterside labour,continued its sittings on the 5th and 6th February. Mr. Bevin, who continued the addresswhich he began on the 3rd February, pointed out that the 16s. per day which was claimedwas an absolute minimum, and that this sum should form a minimum also for piece-workers.He registered his opposition to overtime, and made a claim for time and a half for overtimeor the night shift, not in order that the workers might make more money, but with a viewto discouraging the employers from overtime or night shifts. He emphasised the factthat the minimum should be a national one, and declared that if Liverpool now received12s. and Glasgow 14s., Glasgow could not expect 18s. if a minimum of 16s. were established.At this point the President said with reference to the 125,000 men that Mr. Bevin said herepresented, &quot; These men have considered each, other as -making common cause for aminimum, which shall be a standard and universal minimum,&quot; and Mr. Bevin replied,&quot; That is so.&quot; Mr. Bevin then submitted a family budget for five people, involving anexpenditure of  6 0s Qd. per week. He also produced detailed and elaborate figuresto prove that the employers had the abilitysto pay the wages demanded without furthertaxing the cost of commodities to the public. On the 6th February, Mr. Bevin dealt withthe problems of casual labour and unemployment. To remedy the first he advocated asystem of registration for which the Transport Workers&apos; Federation should be responsible.With regard to unemployment, he maintained that a levy should be put upon all shippingor goods entering a port, and urged that if it was right to levy dock dues to keep the docksin a proper state of repair and efficiency, it was equally right to levy a charge upon allshipping entering a dock in order to form a pool to maintain the workmen when there wasno employment. Mr. Bevin concluded his speech with a passionate plea for opportunityfor cultural development to be granted to labour.Sir Lynden Macassey, speaking on behalf of the employers, submitted that thestandardisation of, wages and conditions was impracticable, having regard to the varyingconditions of the ports and docks. Secondly, it was detrimental to the progressof the ports and docks industry for quite clear economic reasons. He also maintainedthat the wages demand would involve hardship for the general public, and Under presentconditions it would be nationally inexpedient. He dealt with the difficulty of mergingwar advances into permanent wages, and with regard to the claim for a national minimumhe argued that the adjustment of wages had been carried out uniformly on a district and noton a national basis, and referred to the practice in. various industries in which districtrates prevailed. It is already clear that the problem of deciding in favour of districtminima or a national minimum will be one of the most difficult questions before theCourt.(C 1961)L
The London Traffic Combine&apos;s Bill.This Bill has produced an interesting situation as between the National Unionof Railwaymen and the general body of Labour. In the current issue of the &quot;RailwayReview &quot; it is reported that a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Unionof Railwaymen, having considered the whole position of the London electric railways,and being convinced that the present financial position of this Company, though notunder Government control, is such as to prevent their members benefiting under thesettlement, and whilst in no way departing from the declared policy of the union for thenationalisation of railways, decided that whilst the present wages system lasts, they hadno alternative but to give support to the Bill of the London electric railways. A deputa-tion of three, together with the general secretaries, was appointed to wait upon theParliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. and the Labour Party Executive, to place thedecisions before those bodies. This decision is of great interest in view of the fact that itruns directly counter to the attitude of Labour in general, which has registered strongopposition to this Bill.A large and representative meeting consisting of delegates from over 200 trade unions,co-operative societies and Labour bodies, was held on the 7th February to protest againstthe abolition of workmen^ trains and workmen&apos;s fares, and the proposed increase ofordinary fares, and resolutions were passed urging all municipal authorities strongly tooppose the Bill, and calling upon al] members of Parliament for metropolitan constituenciesto act with a view to its rejection. A good deal of criticism was expressed with regard tothe attitude of the National Union of Railwaymen. Mr. J. H. Thomas, in a speech atLeyton, defended the Bill on the ground that there was at present no money to meet thejust demands of the men, and that the National Union of Railwaymen would not be a partyto giving cheap travelling facilities to the public at the expense of sweated railwaymen.Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.The agitation with regard to the relation of agriculture to this Bill continues. At thefirst annual meeting of the Cardiff District Branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union, thepresident stated that the 48-hour rule without overtime would bring British agricultureinto chaos. Farmers must have power to agree with their men at any time to work asmany hours per day as weather conditions made necessary. At a meeting of the North-umberland County Branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union it was contended that thisunion was the only rightful representation of farmers in negotiation with the men, andhostility was expressed to the inclusion of agricultural workers in the Bill.Trades Union Congress.The Minister received a deputation from the Parliamentary Committee of the TradesUnion Congress on the 5th February. The deputation presented resolutions passed atthe Glasgow Trades Union Congress. The resolutions dealt with the strengthening of theinspectorate under the Trades Board Act, the working of the Act in the distributive trades,the administration of the Fair Wages Clause, and the right to work or maintenance. Thedeputation was introduced by Mr. J. Hill. The Minister in reply stated that during allthe time he had been at the Ministry the efficiency of the Trade Board system had alwaysbeen a first care of the department. They had added considerably to the inspection staff.With regard to the Fair Wages Clause, the Minister stated that until he was convincedthat the present fair wages rule was not doing its work fairly, he did not see much reasonfor altering the method they were emplojdng. With regard to the demand for the rightto work or maintenance, something had been done in the way of ensuring that Govern-ment work should be so distributed as to provide additional employment during seasonalor local fluctuations of trade. He was perfectly aware that it was impossible for anyhuman mechanism to provide work at all times for all people. The best they could dowas to provide as well as they could against occasions when unemployment must occur.This could be done by a system of insurance.Trade Unionism among Salaried WorJeers.A conference representative of most of the organisations of salaried workers washeld at Essex Hall on the 7th January, and it was decided to form the National Federationof Professional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Workers. An account of thedevelopment of trade unionism among salaried workers was given in this Report a fortnightago.  The movement, which aims at co-ordinating the efforts of non-manual workers, has
been encouraged by the Labour Research Department. This Department has had underconsideration for two or three months the position of the professional classes in relationto the Labour Movement, and in response to a request for assistance, it summoned thisConference. It has been pointed out, however, by the Labour Research Department,that there is no proposal that this Federation should affiliate with the Labour Party orthe Trades Union Congress. Among the bodies represented at the Conference were theNational Association of Local Government Board Officials, the National Union ofJournalists, the Federation of Law Clerks, the Actors&apos; Association, and various organi-sations of scientific, engineering and technical workers. Two unions of more generalcharacter were also represented in order that the managerial section of the membersmight be embraced in the Federation. These were the National Amalgamated Union ofShop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks and the Amalgamated Union of Co-operativeand Commercial Employees. The Conference decided to appoint a Provisional Councilconsisting of one member from each of the associations represented, the Council to holdoffice until the meeting of the further Conference at which the Federation would beformally inaugurated. The organisation of the Federation will allow of adequate provisionbeing made for the grouping of associations in councils representing various professions.This Federation will not, however, be representative of all the societies embracedin its title, and it seems probable that in the end the affiliated societies will in the mainbe those catering for various classes of clerical workers and foremen. The reason for thisis the suspicion of the technical and professional societies that, despite the disclaimers ofthe Labour Research Department, the new Federation will seek to ally itself with Labour.At the conference on the 7th February in.order to test the attitude of the delegates, arepresentative of the Society of Technical Engineers proposed that &quot; a federation beformed of professional associations, independent of employers&apos; unions on the one handand manual workers&apos; unions on the other, and free to negotiate with both in the bestinterests of the professional worker.&quot; This resolution was not carried, and certain organi-sations of technical and professional workers are now proceeding with a scheme for theformation of four federations of professional and technical workers and the confederationof these federations. It is proposed that these federations should consist of groupsrepresenting respectively industry, finance, public services, and other professions. Thesocieties which are promoting this scheme believe that the interests of the professionalclasses are not safe in the hands of Labour, because manual workers cannot be trustedto value adequately the contribution made by the salaried staffs. They therefore advocatethe formation of a third party in industry representative of management and technicalability.The future of this confederation and its constituent federations will be watched withinterest, as the validity of its claim that there are three fundamental parties in industry,and not two, is a question of the first importance for the future. The Federation startswith the initial disadvantage that it finds no ready-made place for itself in the organi-sation of industry. The general organisation of industry, corroborated, by the WhitleyReport, assumes that there are only two parties in industry, and the efforts of. the mana-gerial and technical staffs in certain industries to obtain separate representation as a third,party on Joint Industrial Councils have not met with much encouragement.Dilution in the Building Trades.A special conference of building trade operatives was held in Manchester on the6th February. All the unions affiliated to the Building Trades Federation were repre-sented, and the question of dilution was thoroughly discussed. The following resolutionwas passed : &quot; This Conference, after carefully considering the proposal of the PrimeMinister to augment building trade labour, expresses its intention to abide loyally bythe agreement for the training of disabled sailors and soldiers, but regards any furtherextension of dilution as being unnecessary, impracticable and economically unsound, andwe hereby resolve to resist the dilution of building trade labour with the utmost strengthof our organisation.&quot; This resolution may be regarded as a final statement of the workers^-position with regard to dilution, It may also be noted that the General Union of OperativeCarpenters and Joiners have circulated to all their branches a statement in which theysay,&quot; It should be noted that dilution of labour is suggested to be introduced principallyon the building of working-class houses, whilst other work has to be performed by skilledcraftsmen. We must insist on the best skilled labour being employed on the buildingof. houses for our people, because we want well-built houses. For these reasons we askyou strenuously to oppose any attempt that may be made to dilute our trade.&quot;  The(C 1901) L2
Manchester conference also declared that nothing in the increased cost of labour or trans-port justified the prices now asked by builders&apos; merchants and dealers in building tradematerial, and it was stated that the position had been rendered additionally acute by theGovernment bonus or premium, which gives the speculative builder advantage over thelocal authorities. And the carpenters&apos; statement above referred to declares that &quot; thereis sufficient labour in the country to deal with the housing problem effectively, providedthe employers and others who are concerned are prepared to forego the higher profitswhich are being made on the commercial and luxury class of building.&quot;Building Guild Movement.The negotiations of the Building Trades Guild in Manchester with the Irlarn UrbanDistrict Council have been successful, and the Council has decided to entrust the Guildwith the building of a thousand houses, 500 to be erected within the year. The arrange-ment is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health. Details as to the nature of thecontract to be entered into between the Guild and the Council of Irlam have not yet beensettled. The Guild cannot give any financial guarantees, and in the end it will probably. confine itself to providing the labour and paying the wages out of funds provided by theCouncil. All materials mil be supplied by the Council. Ten per cent, will be added tothe actual cost of labour in order to cover the cost of guaranteeing the workmen a fallweek&apos;s wage, and for the payment of general overhead charges. It is stated that privateemployers are considering whether any action will be necessary in view of the competitionthat this method of building suggests. In addition to the scheme which has been adoptedat Irlam, other tentative suggestions, some of which were noted last week, have been madefor the erection of houses on a Guild basis, and several municipalities have decided toerect houses by direct labour.The Rank and File Movement.The draft agenda of the rank and file convention A?hich has been summoned to meeton the day before and every evening during the sittings of the forthcoming special TradesUnion Congress contains a large number of resolutions of an extreme type.   In the-covering letter which the promoters of this convention sent out with the agenda, theystate that the convention is rendered absolutely necessary by the fact that in the majorityof cases no mandate has been asked for by the executives of the unions represented at theTrades Union Congress.  They apparently desire, therefore, by means of this specialconvention, to influence the Congress in the direction of extreme action.  As might havebeen expected, the resolutions deal largely with Russia.   The first resolution expressesthe enthusiastic admiration of the Convention for the great constructive work of com-munism achieved by the Soviets, the second urges the delegates at the Congress to declarefor the use of industrial action to force the Government by means of a general strike tostop all forms of intervention.   Further resolutions attempt to apply the Soviet systemto this country, and maintain that the Soviets are the natural machinery to be used forthe overthrow of the capitalist system and the administration of a communist republic.The Convention calls upon the workers to prepare for the creation of Soviets consistingof: (1) Delegates from all kinds of industrial workers allocated on the workshop basis ;(2) Delegates from the land workers;  (3) Delegates from villages and hamlets in areaswhere the population for technical reasons cannot be divided for purposes of. representa-tion on industrial lines;  (4) Delegates of women not industrially employed, appointedto represent the area in which they live by the women of those localities.No representation to be given to those who live by employing others for privategain or on accumulated wealth. All representatives to be instructed by those theyrepresent and subject to recall at any time; The convention also urges its delegates tosecure the withdrawl of their organisations from the Second International, and theiraffiliation to the Third (Moscow) International.A number of general resolutions are included in the agenda. One of these states, onwhat grounds is not apparent, that whilst unemployment is chronic under capitalism andis now acute in every capitalist country, in Soviet Russia under the fertile influence ofcommunism there is no unemployment; on the contrary there is work for an unlimitedsupply of workers. With regard to nationalisation, the Convention calls upon the workersto prepare industrial machinery to take control of the means of production and distributionindependently of capitalism. One of the most interesting resolutions deals with theproposed new Trade Union General Council. It states &quot; This Convention expects as acardinal principle of industrial organisations, control of administration from the lowestgrade upwards, i.e., by the rank and file, and is therefore opposed to the creation of a
general staff until the existing organisations have been reorganised on the lines of thisprinciple. The Convention calls on the workers in each industry to see to it that anindustrial union shall be established which shall admit all the workers in industry regardlessof sex, grade or craft, and shall be built up on the basis of workshop delegates subject torecall by those who elect them.The main interest in these proposals is that they are of a rather more practicallyconstructive character than generally emanate from this quarter.Organisation in tlie National Union of Clerks.Guild organisation within the National Union of Clerks has now reached a veryconsiderable stage of development. There are now in existence several Guilds, all of whichconsist of members of the National Union of Clerks, and all of which are affiliated to theparent body. Some of these Guilds are the following : The Benefit Societies&apos; Staffs&apos; Guildembraces the Industrial Assurance Friendly Societies&apos; and the National Health Societies&apos;Staffs. The Brewery Clerks Guild is in existence in Wales and its members include Brewery,Milling and Allied Trades clerical workers. The Building and Allied Trades Clerks&apos; Guildis a London group which has deputed its representatives to call on the branches to explainits scheme. The Colliery Workers&apos; Guild is one of the premier guilds and groups havealready been formed in North Staffordshire, Wales, Manchester, and South Yorkshire.In the Engineering Clerks&apos; Guild groups are in existence in Nor oh Staffs, Manchester,Bolton, and Rugby. The Iron and Steel Clerks&apos; Guild has been very successful, and anagreement has been made with the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation that its localmembers should work in conjunction with the confederation^ local officials and throughthe guilds. North Staffs, Glengarnock, Penistone, Wishaw, Stockbridge, Chapeltown,and Wales have groups of this guild. Groups of the Local Government Clerks&apos; Guild existin Manchester and Wales, and the formation of a group of London members is expectedsoon. The Newspaper Printing and Publishing Clerks&apos; Guild has in existence a verysuccessful London group. A group has also been formed at Norwich under the nameof the East Anglian Newspaper Clerks&apos; Guild. The Pottery Clerks&apos; Guild has been formedin North Staffs and was instrumental in securing the representation of the National Unionof Clerks on the Joint Industrial Council for the pottery trade. The Trade UnionsFraternities Guild has a London group which is attempting to organise all the clerksemployed in trade union offices. The Government Clerks&apos; Guild has not been very suc-cessful, but it is reported that an important meeting of Government clerks took place inDecember, and it is hoped that this guild will now progress more rapidly than in the past.The general organisation of the guild with reference to the National Union of Clerks isthat for each industry in which clerks are employed a National Guild shall be set up,having groups in various centres corresponding roughly to the branches of the NationalUnion of Clerks.Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement.There is evidence that the recent entente between the Labour Party, the Trade UnionCongress and the Co-operative Societies is creating a certain amount of perturbation amongprivate, traders. It is announced in the current number of the &quot; British Baker &quot; that anew organisation called the Amalgamated Trades Association has been formed to deal withthis question. This organisation includes a large number&quot; of different trades, and it hasas its main aim propaganda with a view to the defence of the private trader. Accordingto this Association the avowed policy of the Labour Co-operative Alliance is to establisha comprehensive system of State-controlled co-operative production and distribution. Byprivate traders this is judged to be a serious menace, as it might come to be in the BakingTrade, where the co-operative movement has already got a very strong hold in certainareas, and it is proposed to embark at once upon the task of bringing home to the electorateby reasoned and insistent propaganda what is involved in this alliance. The headquartersof this Association is reported to be at the London Chamber of Commerce. In this connec-tion it may also be noted that the &quot; National Association Review,&quot;, the organ of theNational Association of Bakers, Confectioners and Caterers, is much alarmed at thereported proposal of the Navy and Army Canteen Board to set up retail establishmentsin towns where soldiers, sailors and airmen are stationed, for the supply of articles requiredby officers, men, and their families. Such a movement, it is maintained, in conjunctionwith the co-operative societies, will put the tax-paying tradesman out of business. &quot; There- .fore,&quot; this Review continues, &quot; it behoves everyone interested in preventing this insidiouseffort to establish a Government retail monopoly to speak with no uncertain voice.&quot;
Electrical Trades Union.A conference has recently taken place between the Electrical Trades Union and the-National Association of Electrical Employees, and it was decided that cinema operatorswho were qualified for membership of the Electrical Trades Union should be eligible formembership of both organisations; and an arrangement was made for the recognition byeach union of the other union&apos;s cards. The Electrical Trades Union is noAv taking itssecond ballot on the question of amalgamation with the new engineering union. It maybe remembered that on the first vote the majority of the Electrical Trades Union in favourof an amalgamation fell short of the 50 per cent, legally necessary by 2-  per cent., and astrong effort is now being made to secure the adhesion of the Electrical Trades Union to.the large amalgamation.R.
