Reports received, believed reliable, that on 31st JanuaryGeneral Nadir Khan, who has for some months been Afghan Commander-in-Chief,held jirga at liada, near Jalalabad, attended by large numbers of Afghan tribesmenand including 100 Afridis and several Mohmands. Nadir Khan made inflammatoryspeech saying about 10th February second. Indo-Afghan Conference would be heldand if Afghan demands were met there would be peace, otherwise war, and tribesmust be prepared to take part. In the event of war there would be simultaneousattacks by Mohmands on Shabkadr, Afridis on Ali Masjid,&apos;(? Ningraharis) on LandiKotal.   Afghan regulars would reinforce tribesmen at convenient points.Other reports say Amir intends sending down delegates, who will put forwardextravagant demands, especially with regard to our tribes. Grant ascribes thesereports to intelligent anticipation. - .Khan of Gandamak has written to Political, Kurram, of great military activityand talk of (? GhazaJ in Afghanistan and warns us to make all preparations.We are disposed&apos; to regard these reports and warning and Nadir Khan&apos;s speechas merely. Afghan attempt to alarm us as a preliminary, to pressing onus treaty offriendship and definite negotiations for transfer of tribal territory *to Afghanistan.There are no sign(s) that Afghanistan is contemplating war and secret informationreceived seems to point to deliberate Afghan plan to bluff us by raising Bolshevistand tribal bogies, although they are &apos; fully conscious they could not stand upagainst us.
