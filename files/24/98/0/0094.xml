This Document is the Property of        /    /i merit.Military Secret.1295From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,17th February 192(3.&apos;*/TEHHiS^ . (Received 18th.)2068. Malleson wires 12th February: &quot; Agent from Chardjui reports 25thJanuary : Kurapatkin, accompanied by 10 high officials and an escort of 50 Cossacks,arrived here 24th January. He made public speech denouncing cruelties andoppressions of former Bolsheviks, who have now been severely punished. He dwelton necessity of reorganising industries and trade, and spoke in high terms ofTurkestan, especially Bokhara, &apos; whose statesmanlike attitude during last two yearsof anarchy was beyond all praise.&apos; He promised Bokhara complete independence,and said he had been authorised personally to give Amir this assurance. He saidboth for military and industrial reasons it was essential to restore communicationswith Termez as soon as possible. For this purpose he hoped that coal and oilwould soon be available. Kurapatkin visited the new barracks under construction,and visited sick and wounded from the Khiva campaign.&quot; 2. The disturbances in Khiva have now been completely put down by Bolsheviks.&quot; 3. In Chardjui garrison only 400 men.&quot;4. Postage and telegraph arrangements are now being restored to normal.&quot;5. In Chardjui it is said, that whilst there is no talk of Bolshevik regular troopsgoing to Afghanistan, arrangements wrere being made to send there via Termez in amonth or two, a pure Mohamedan Force now under training in Turkestan. Thiswould probably consist of two Cavalry Regiments, one Battalion, three Field Batteries,and 50 or 60 Machine guns. These troops were to help in the war against India forthe freeing of the East.&quot; 6. Note. Although I have had several reports, including one from my Russianagent in Tashkend, of the presence of Kurapatkin in Turkestan, I have seen nothingabout him in Bolshevik wireless. Possibly he is officially known under some (corruptgroup) name.   I am making enquiries about this.&quot;Can War Office supply any information regarding this Kurapatkin ? It seemsunlikely that he is General of that name who was Governor-General of RussianTurkestan in 1916, and was arrested by Bolsheviks at Tashkend in April 1917.
