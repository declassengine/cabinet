Military Secret.1237362rom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,mh February 1920.(Received 19th.)2052. . Mallesou wires 12th February, repeating Teheran : &quot; My Daragaz agent, who is generally well informed regarding Bolshevik activity,wires llth February : &quot; &apos; In Askabad great rejoicings over capture of Krasnovodsk. Bolsheviks talkof being in Baku in few weeks time. They talk of dropping incendiary bombs on oilfields.&quot; &apos; 2. It does not appear to be the intention of Bolsheviks officially to employarmed force against Persia. Now that Krasnovodsk problem is out of the way theywill take up again their former plan of first sending in swarms of Persian agitators.These will be supplemented from time to time by relay of Persians now serving inBolshevik ranks. In this manner it is hoped to bring about armed risings inKhorasan which would bring inhabitants in conflict with British, aucl give Bolsheviksexcuse for armed intervention.&quot; &apos; 3. Jawad Khan Senki is getting Askabad Persian residents to send appeals toConstantinople and Tehran asking that he should be allowed to remain in Askabad.Agent says there is no doubt about Senki&apos;s Bolshevik sympathy.&quot; &apos; 4. Capture of Krasnovodsk has greatly increased Bolshevik prestige withPersians and every one.&quot; &apos; 5. Bolsheviks are said to be largely increasing all garrisons on Russianfrontier and also on the Merv Kushk side.&apos;&quot; 6. With reference to above we endeavour to intercept Bolshevik agents, butI cannot say we are adequately supported by Persian authorities. There is littledoubt that Persian custom officials and gendarmerie on frontier fraternise with&apos;Bolsheviks. Nor do I think Governor-General and his officials make any real effortto stop incoming of Bolshevik spies and agitators. I suggest they should be told thatthis is particularly their work, and that our troops here are in no way responsible forany results which may arise out of their neglect of precautions and their lack of co-operation with us.&quot;
