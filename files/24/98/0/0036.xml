SUMMARY.The event of the month has been the decision of the SupremeCouncil to open up trade in Eussia through the co-operators.. TheSoviet Government has accepted the proposal, but characteristicallyhas taken over the Co-operative Societies and appointed Litvinoff asChairman. It is in accordance with their traditions to allow noopportunity of spreading their doctrines in other countries to beneglected, and the danger that, the representatives received inWestern countries may be Bolshevik propagandist agents amplysupplied with money, ostensibly for the purposes of trade, but secretlyto finance subversive bodies, will have to be very carefully watched.Poland must now be put on the &quot;Danger List.&quot; Though thePoles are eager to assure us that the country is not likely tosuccumb to Bolshevism they are perfectly aware that if they acceptthe Soviet Peace offer Bolshevik doctrines will spread.Except for a reactionary party led by General Balahovitch, whois endeavouring to form an army of White Kussians for an advanceon Moscow, the tendency of the Border States is towards peace withSoviet Eussia.A Western Bureau of the Third International has been formed at&apos;Amsterdam and a Central Bureau at Vienna.   The Conference ofthe Third International at Amsterdam began on the 28th January,and was attended by English delegates.The Extremists are very active in France, but all their efforts todislodge Jouhaux from his position in the C.G.T, have failed.In Belgium there is unrest among the State employees.  TheGovernment has been obliged to recognise their Unions.Graber, of the Socialist Party in Switzerland, is trying to form anew International with a programme midway between those of theSecond and Third Internationals. He hopes for the support ofthe German Independents and a section of the Italian Socialists.In Germany strong anti-Bolshevik measures, amounting almostto a dictatorship by Noske, have driven the Spartacists underground.Secessions from the Independents to the Spartacists are reported tobe numerous.In Austria there is a recrudescence of Bolshevik activity due tothe introduction of funds and agitators from Moscow.It is believed that the overwhelming majority secured by theChristian Nationals and Small Land Owners at the recent elections inHungary will result in an establishment of a Monarchy.[2292] B 2
Italy is settling down after the railway strike, and a large sectionof the Socialists is in favour of a more constructive policy.The Scandinavian Bolshevik leaders held a secret meeting atwhich they acknowledged that the Bolshevik movement inScandinavia was mainly intellectual, and that the people were notripe for a revolution.The lock-outs in Madrid and Barcelona having come to an end,the situation is almost normal. There is evidence of German andBussian money having been used for fomenting the recent industrialdisturbances.Important meetings have been held at Zurich during the monthbetween the prescribed Turkish leaders and other of the Young, Turk Party. Enver Pasha was at Berlin up till the 23rd December.The object in view is to secure the support of all the Turkishleaders and the Emir Feisul for an attack which Enver proposes tomake upon Syria with the aid of a Bed Army. On the other hand,a competent observer on the spot states that Pan-Islamism andBolshevism are having very little effect upon the Moslems of CentralAsia.There is good reason for believing that the Amir of Afghanistanis afraid to allow his alliance with the Bolsheviks to go too far. Helikes modern conditions, he dislikes Socialism, and he is not certainthat the Eussian Soviet Government may not be a tool of theGermans. Enver Pasha has sent Kazim Beg to Kabul to bringpressure to bear upon the Amir, and he professes to be certain ofbeing able to bring &quot;him round.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in ForeignCountries.PART I.Prance. The election of M. Deschanel as President of theRepublic was due to a rally of the Senators and Deputies of theLeft Parties against M. Clemenceau. It was agreed at a meetingwhich took place at the Grand Oonseil de VOrdre de la Franc-Maconntrie du Grand-Orient de France, held on the 14th of January,that M. Clemenceau was becoming a danger to the Republic, andthat his Anglophile tendencies were ruining the French rate ofmoney exchange; the general opinion seemed to be that ifM. Clemenceau were elected President, he would bring about adissolution of Parliament and establish a dictatorial rigime. TheRadicals and Democrats, therefore, combined to defeat his candidature.If these groups continue to hold together, it is clear that the Leftwill become the predominant party, and that the Bloc National willcease to exist. The Left Party desires the acquittal of M. Caillaux,f ivours the recognition of the Russian Soviet Government, is anxiousfor the fullest commercial intercourse with Germany and Austria,a d for a decrease in the importations from Great Britain and theUnited States of America. It is considered unlikely that theGovernment&apos; of M. Millerand will remain for long in power, and it isanticipated that the new President will seek advice from, and followthe policy of, M. Briand. The Left Party, indeed, centres its hopesin M. Deschanel, who is a pronounced Democratic Republican, andwas much in touch with M. Caillaux when the latter was negotiatingwith the German Government with regard to Morocco.The final results in the elections for the Senate resulted inconsiderable successes for the parties opposed to the Government,and they now hold 112 seats out of a total of 240. The partyis showing a bitter antagonism towards M. Millerand and hisGovernment.Meanwhile the Extremists are displaying much activity. Theirformer champions now appear to be considered &quot; back numbers,&quot; andTrotsky, in a letter addressed to Loriot, Rosmer, Monatte, and Pericat,is said to have urged them to have nothing to do with the policy ofLonguet, Jouhaux, and Renaudel, who &quot; are helping to make Francethe leader of the world&apos;s counter-revolution.&quot; A Gomitd de Defensede Marins has recently been formed, which has for its object thespreading of Bolshevik doctrines among the sailors of. the Frenchfleet, in commemoration of the sailors who mutinied in the BlackSea; this committee is said to have already about 500 members. A&quot; Friends of Russia Committee &quot; has also been formed in Paris underthe leadership of Lefebre and Rappoport, and includes some of themost violent agitators in France.  The Association RipuMicainc des
Anciens Combattants is rapidly gaining ground, and it is stated thatthis association and Le Groupe Glarfe are to all intents and purposesone organisation, as their policies are the same, and they areworking together. The most revolutionary spirits are rallying to thesetwo bodies. A huge meeting was held in Paris on the 25th January,at which the principal speakers were Jews, such as Raymond Lefebre,Mme. Severine, Antonis Coen, Charles Rappoport (alias Krabbobork),Loriot, Georges Pioch, Noel Garnier, and Paul Vaillant-Couturier.These speakers declared that Communism alone could save theproletariat of the world; Great Britain was accused of beingresponsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people by meansof the blockade, and that, in comparison with her policy, theconduct of the German troops was quite excusable. The meetingsent its greetings to Lenin and Trotsky. The Association Bepublicainedes A.nciens Combattants is now in close touch with similar societiesin Germany, Italy, and Belgium, and, in addition to inviting theBritish Ex-Service Men&apos;s League to attend the InternationalConference which it proposes to hold in May, it has also invited theInternational Union of Ex-Service Men in England to send delegatesto the Congress, although, owing to lack of funds apparently, thisinvitation has so far not been accepted. The association is issuingan appeal, which is described as &quot;a masterpiece of revolutionarypropaganda,&quot; advocating the destruction of all capitalist Governments.It is said to have 50,000 adherents in Ireland and to count uponobtaining support in Turkey and Egypt. The French Socialists arein touch with the Sinn Fein movement, and, in a letter recentlyreceived from Ireland by a member of the French Socialist Party, itwas stated that the struggle against England would be continuedwithout respite.In a letter addressed to the Scandinavian comrades, Lapierre, oneof the assistant secretaries of the French C.G.T., appeals for moreactive support for the Bolshevik movement from the Scandinavianworkers ; he states that, in spite of the recent elections, the Frenchproletariat has not lost courage, and that, although there can be noimmediate revolution in France, he believes the Government willsoon have to change its view with regard to Bolshevism. TheExtremists, however, have so far failed to capture the C.G.T., andJouhaux still retains his power. Indeed, for the time being, as aresult of a meeting of the Gomite FMSral of the C.G.T. held in Parison the 12th of January, it would appear that the advanced minorityhas lost ground recently, and that the moderate majority is seekingto work in co-operation with the Government. All idea of a generalstrike at any rate appears to have been dropped for the moment.Hidden forces are reported to be at work behind the C.G.T., whichare attempting to form an alliance between Capital and Labour, andit is said that the Masonic Lodges&apos; of France are supporting thismovement in opposition to a section of the Jesuits, who are carryingon a vigorous propaganda against such an alliance among the labourersin all the more important French industries. Whether or not thereis any basis for this report, it is clear that the C.G.T. is meeting withconsiderable opposition from the C.N.T. (GonfMdration Rationale duTravail), which is supported by the Clerical Party. This body is com-posed of the bourgeoisie and agriculturists dwellers in the country-
who are opposed to the political principles of the artisans in the towns.The C.G.T. professes to ignore the C.N.T., but there is no doubt that itrealises that the opposition may become very strong. At a recentconference of the O.G-.T. upon the attitude to be adopted towardsthe C.NT., it was unanimously agreed that the only reply to the newchallenge, if it became serious, would be to call a general strike andso paralyse economic life throughout the country.At a meeting of the National Confederation Committee of theC.G.T., which was held on the 11th of January, it was stated that themembership of the C.G.T. had increased from 200,000 to 2,400,000since 1913; the expenditure of the organisation for 1920 wasestimated at 730,000 francs, and the receipts, calculated on the basisof 1,000,000 contributing adherents, at 684,000 francs.At a meeting of the Committee of the Third International,which was held in Paris on the 10th of January, it was proposed tosupport a vigorous campaign in favour of the Hungarian Communists,and Loriot warned the meeting against the activities of Longuet andhis adherents at the coming Congress of the Socialist Party. It isclear that the Socialist Party is much divided. The ExecutiveCommittee of the Communist International has invited the Com-munists of France to expel from their ranks all partisans of theSecond International.At the first meeting of the Oonseil F/conomique de Travail (seeFrance, Eeport 14), which was held last December under the presi-dency of Jouhoux, the latter stated that the Council would not becontent to put forward vague formulae, but would make concretesuggestions, which, if opposed, would be carried by force. Thisstatement was received with great enthusiasm.Economic conditions in France do not appear to be improving.The cost of living in Paris is again rising, and the want of housingaccommodation is causing discontent throughout the country. Crimeof every description, more particularly robbery with violence, isprevalent, especially in Paris, and the police seem to be powerless tocope with the evil.Belgium. Eeconstruction in Belgium is said to be going on ata rapid rate; the telephone and railway systems are now workingnormally. Although the cost of living appears to be less than inEngland, there is dissatisfaction at the high cost of food, and on the18th of January a public meeting of protest was organised bythe Antwerp Labour Party. The proceedings passed off withoutincident.A special Congress of the Belgian Labour Party was recentlyheld at Brussels, at which it was decided to allow the F6d6ration desJeunes Gardes Socialities to have representatives on the GeneralCouncil of the party; the latter, however, on the 19th of Januarydecided to have nothing to do with the Labour Party. TheFddSration des Jeunes Gardes Socialistes is reported to be in financialdifficulty, and its official organ L&apos;FxploiU is published at a loss. Itis interesting to note that L&apos;Art Libre, the organ of the IntellectualBolsheviks (see Belgium, Eeport 15), and LExploiU are apparentlyworking for the same political objects, and sometimes almost identicalarticles appear in both papers.   Unrest among the Government
employees terminated in a strike of the personnel in variousMinistries in Brussels. The strike began on the 11th of Januaryand ended on the 15th, when the Government conceded the men&apos;sdemands. The Government has thus recognised trade unionismamongst its employees, and this may become a source of danger inthe future. Although they have returned to work, a certain amountof unrest still exists among the miners in the Charleroi district.Switzerland. Graber, the Secretary of the Swiss SocialistParty, is still energetically urging the constitution of a new Inter-national, with a programme which is to be a compromise betweenthat of the 2nd and 3rd Internationals, and a movement is on foot toobtain the support of the German Independents and a section of theItalian Socialists.John de Kay is reported to have recently been in Berlin, wherehe went to negotiate with certain German financiers with regard toraising money for the Bolshevik Red Cross, a matter in whichLitvinoff is interested. It is considered likely that he has beentrying to dispose of the Chinese Railway bonds, which apparentlyLitvinoff unsuccessfully endeavoured to dispose of in Copenhagen.John de Kay is said to have quarrelled with Jean Debrit, the editorof La Feuilk, and to have withdrawn his financial support from thatnewspaper. It is interesting to note in this connection that in theissue of La Feuillt for the 23rd of January an urgent appeal is madefor funds; the statement is made that the present deficit to becovered is 30,000 fr. a montli, even if the price of the paper isincreased from 5 to 10 centimes.Grimm, the Swiss Socialist leader, who was imprisoned for hisshare in the strike riots in November 1918, has just been released,and Platten, who was condemned in his absence to several monthsimprisonment for the same offence, is reliably reported to be still inMoscow.&apos;The Government has requested Parvus to leave Switzerland.Parvus is now extremely unpopular among the Norwegian Extremistson account of his alleged treachery; he is said to be on intimateterms with Stanning and Borgbjerg, who are considered moderatemen by the Norwegian Bolsheviks, and to have been a tool of theGerman Junkers, amassing a huge fortune by his work in Denmarkfor Germany during the war.It is reported that a strong pro-British feeling has arisen inSwitzerland, and that the German elements are beginning to feelthat they have misjudged England and her aims during the past. Itwould seem that to a certain degree they are trying to carry out thetypically German resolution which was recently passed at a generalmeeting of merchants and hotel proprietors at Frankfort, viz.: Wirmilssen uns jetzt systematisch liebenswiirdig machtn.Germany. The recent disturbances on the 13th of Januaryoutside the Reichstag appear to have been planned more by theGerman equivalent to the &quot; Shop Stewards&quot; than by the Spartacists.Responsible people in Germany view the present situation withconsiderable anxiety; order is being maintained and outwardlyeverything is calm, but this state of affairs is only due to the sternmethods of suppression adopted by the Government since the
BiiiSili.....-......................iiJi^aiiU^-^iiU...-,-^^.......9disturbances. The disturbance enabled the Government to establishI a state of siege practically throughout Germany, whereby the militaryI authorities took over the executive power; and it also furnished theI Government with a good excuse for suppressing the Independent; Socialist newspapers and arresting some of the leaders of the party.! In the course of a recent conversation Noske himself stated that he; was now exercising a dictatorship such as had not existed in! Germany for a century. It would appear that the Government is\   stronger than it was when peace was signed and that the Beichswehrand the Sicherheitspolizei are now so well armed and organised that no\ violent outbreak would have a chance of success. The MonarchistsI recognise this and no cmvp d&apos;fitat is likely for the present. TheirI best chance of success would be to engineer a Spartacist rising andI then to step in and re-establish a Monarchy during the generalI chaos. No such outbreak, however, appears probable, as the) Independent leaders without whose support a revolution would beI impossible have become more experienced and are in no hurry toI , run any risks. It should be noted, however, that a movement toff obtain possession of a large section of the press for the purposesI of Monarchist propaganda is reported to be going on both in BerlinI and the provinces. It is worthy of note that Herr Stinnes, whoI formerly gave support to Bermont, is, with other magnates in theI   so-called Schwer-Industrie, connected with this movement.The Communists are carrying on an extensive propagandaI underground which, owing mainly to economic reasons, is reportedI   to be meeting with success in some parts of the country notablyin the Buhr mining district, where there has recently been a strike.I   The maintenance of order in Germany, as in most other countries,depends largely upon the restoration of the transport services and&apos;l   the provision of coal, food and raw materials.The Russian Soviet Government has apparently stepped in inI order to try and heal the differences between the Hamburg groupI of Communists and the Central group of the party in Germany.!   The main difference between the two groups is that the HamburgCommunists believe that the revolutionary activities of locali organisations should be controlled by their own leaders, while theI Central Bureau is anxious to maintain its directing authority. The1 Communist party has transferred its headquarters to Chemnitz inI Saxony, and in a recent letter to Strom Badek asserts that he has1 *&apos; established an admirable connection between Moscow, Berlin andI Leipzig. Since April 1919 there has been a fairly well-organisedI courier service between the German Spartacists and the Russian1 Bolsheviks; in a letter to Zinovieff, Dr. Schweizer, one of thef Spartacist leaders in Berlin, speaks of an organisation which heI   controls for the forging of passports for the use of these couriers.It is reported that on the 27th of January a new and dangerousI organisation was formed, called the Revolutionary Councils Union,I the aim of which is to secure the control of production in the handsI of the Revolutionary Workmen&apos;s Councils. There are indicationsI that the Communists and Independent Socialists have agreed to workI together in this new Union. Many Independent Socialists have1 recently joined the Communist ranks owing to dissensions withinI   their own party, but no general union between the two parties is[2292] B 3
anticipated unless the Independents agree to accept the Communistprogramme unconditionally. A reliable informant who has recentlyreturned from Soviet Russia states that a political and militaryalliance exists between the Germans and the Bolsheviks and that,in addition to German political agents, there are German staffofficers in Moscow ; the Germans are also said to be supporting themovement for independence in the Ukraine. This information withregard to German , foreign policy, however, scarcely tallies withanother report, which states that the successes of the Red Armyare regarded with considerable alarm in Germany and that theSoviet Government has asked the German Government to make adefinite statement as to its attitude towards the Bolshevik regime inRussia.A fusion of the Peasants&apos; League (Bauembund) and theChristian Peasants Agricultural Association, founded by Dr. Heim,the well-known Zentrum leader in Bavaria, seems to have given thesignal for a new orientation of Bavarian policy against the Reich andPrussia. Both Dr. Heim and Herr Eisenberger in recent speecheshave vigorously attacked the Central German Government anddeclined to entertain any proposal for the unification of the Reich.The leaders of the Socialist Government in Wiirtemburg, whowere extremely radical before the war, are now reported to haveveered completely round to the Right. On the other hand, radicalpropaganda has had considerable effect among the industrial classesin Wurlemburg, and at the recent Congress of the Trade Unions ofMetal Workers at Stuttgart, only Independent Socialists andCommunists were elected to the Executive Committee of the Union.The feeling against the Central Government is not nearly so strongin Wurtemburg as in Bavaria.A school has been established near Berlin for the training ofagents for the German Intelligence Service; French and Belgianstudents have already been secured, and it is hoped shortly to obtainEnglishmen and Irishmen. The notorious Baron von Horst iscarrying on a vigorous propaganda in favour of the Irish Republic;he points out that by extending a helping hand to Ireland, Germanywill secure the friendship of the United States of America, whichalso desire to see a free Ireland.At a meeting of the Godesberg branch of the Landwehr a tributewas paid to the British authorities in Cologne, who were held entirelyresponsible for the comparative lack of Bolshevism in the Rhineland.Austria. A recrudescence of Bolshevik activities is reportedfrom Austria, probably as a consequence of the return of Steinhardtfrom Russia. He is stated to have brought both money andinstructions from Lenin, and is believed to be in favour of animmediate revolution. Toman, however, another of the moreimportant Communist leaders, is said to be against any prematureaction. It is not considered likely that a rising will break out inVienna, where the working-class population is not revolutionary.The poverty and hunger of the people may, however, lead todisturbances of which the Extremists will avail themselves and, if. Bolshevism makes progress in Poland or Germany, it is certain tospread to Vienna.  Coal is probably the key to the situation.   If
coal could be provided the factories could begin working, and theworkmen would receive wages with which to buy food.The Communists now control most of the workmen&apos;s councils inVienna, but this is not due to any large increase in their numbers, butmerely to the fact that large numbers of workmen did not trouble torecord their votes at the last elections. As the workmen&apos;s councilsare virtually the link between the Left Wing and the SocialistDemocratic Party, their capture by the Communists may haveconsiderable significance.The present Austrian Government is much influenced by theextreme Left of the Social Democratic Party, and Herr Eldersch, theMinister of the Interior, is believed to be in sympathy with theCommunists. He was instrumental in removing Bela Kun and otherHungarian prisoners from the internment camp where they wereincarcerated. Bela Kun is now in a convalescent home in Vienna,. where he is said to be on hunger strike. The German, Hamburger,another of the Communist prisoners, has been released, together withseveral others against whom the Hungarian Government had issuedno warrants.Three Italian Extremists, including Schweide, the Budapestrepresentative of the Avanti, under Bela Kun&apos;s rdgime, recentlyvisited Vienna, ostensibly to arrange for the journey of 1,500 childrento Milan under the &quot; Save the Children &quot; movement, but in reality toget into touch with Bela Kun at Karlstein, and to arrange a couriersystem between the Austrian Communists and the Italian ExtremeSocialists. The visit to Karlstein was successfully carried out on somepretext which did not apparently arouse the suspicions of the Viennapolice. It seems quite within the bounds of possibility that similarmethods will be employed by Austrian Communists to get into touchwith Extremists in this country, since a proposal has been made bythe &quot; Save the Children Fund &quot; that a number of destitute childrenshould be brought to this country from Vienna. The danger wouldbe not from the children, but from the people who accompanythem.In the event of a revolutionary outbreak, it is not likely that theGovernment would be able to offer much resistance. Reports as tothe strength and trustworthiness of the police vary, but the Chief ofthe Police is said to be a capable and absolutely reliable man whohas confidence in his men. An alarming factor in the situation isthat throughout Austria there is an enormous quantity of firearms inthe possession of the people, of which the Communists could possessthemselves in the event of civil disturbances.In Special Report No. 14 an account was given of the &quot; CentralEurope International Bureau &quot; established in Vienna.Hungary. The Hungarian elections have resulted in thereturn of seventy-two Christian Nationals, sixty-seven Small Land-owners Party, four Democrats, two Non-Party men, and oneIndependent Christian Socialist. Although the Socialists abstainedfrom voting as a protest against the alleged suppression by theGovernment of their electioneering pamphlets, there is no doubtthat the great majority of Hungarians desire the restoration of theMonarchy.[2292] B 4
M. Huszar has refused to resign office until after the summoningof the National Assembly. It is likely that Admiral Horthy willbe nominated as provisional &quot; Chief of State.&quot;After careful investigations the British High Commissioner inHungary has come to the conclusion that the action of the HungarianGovernment with regard to the trials of the Communists has notbeen unduly severe, and that the prisoners in the internment campsare not ill-treated.It is reported that Boehm ex-War Minister of the HungarianCommunist Republic, has been in Vienna for some time, and hasformed the Communist refugees from Hungary into a group underhis leadership. It is even suggested that this group has connectionswith the Austrian State Police, and that it is encouraged by theAustrian Government in the hope that its activities may checkthe monarchist tendencies in Hungary. Robert Schwarz, who is the&quot;confidential agent of the Socialist Party in Buda Pesth, is a memberof this groupiIn connection with the recent Communist plot to overthrowM. Huszar&apos;s Government and to assassinate Admiral Horthy, it isreported that the conspirators proposed to slay their victim by meansof poisoned needles the same method as that employed by theSyndicalists in Spain for murdering their employers.Italy. A National Socialist Conference was held at Florenceduring the second week of January at which more than sixty provin-cial federations were represented. The proceedings were of interestin view of the divergence of views between the more moderateelements of the party, represented by Modigliani, and the Extremists,led by Bombacci. Serrati, editor of Avanti, admitted that therewas something to be said for the policy of the more moderate membersof the party, who wished to effect reforms by parliamentary ratherthan revolutionary methods. Serrati has hitherto been considered anExtremist; he now appears to be following the example of Lazzari,who was leader of the Extremists in 1912 and has now veered roundto the side of the Moderates. In spite of the fact that the Congressconfirmed the Maximalist programme adopted last October, there areindications that the party as a whole is beginning to realise that itmust adopt a more constructive policy. The strength of the Socialistshas been due to the close union between the various sections of theparty, but it is not expected that this unity will last much longer, asmany of the new members of Parliament will vote against theirleaders if they attempt to carry out a policy of violence.The Government must now be regretting its weakness in allowingMalatesta to return to Italy. This old man, who was an extinctvolcano in London, has now broken out as an irruptive force: he hasannounced that he is prepared to lead a revolution provided that allwho oppose violence are expelled from the Socialist Party. A largeshare in bringing about the recent railway strike is attributed to him,and he has admitted that the only way of starting a revolution wouldbe by means of such a strike.The principal organisers of the railway strike were three ExtremistDeputies, Miziano, Scarabello, and Panebianco. The ostensible objectsof the strike were economic, and related to questions of pay, pensions
and hours of labour. Behind these causes, however, there werepolitical aims, and the authorities suspect that Bolshevik funds wereplaced at the disposal of the strikers, although there is no definiteevidence of such support having been given.Public opinion in Italy was absolutely hostile to the railwaymen;the strike was looked upon as an attempt by political agitators tointimidate the Government, as, economically, it was unjustifiable, therailwaymen being the best paid of all Italian public servants. TheGovernment took military precautions to guard against intimidationand sabotage, and acted with vigour.A new organisation has been formed in Italy, comparable withthe Garde Civiqw in Switzerland, to fight the Socialist-Bolshevikparty. It is called the &quot; Combatants&apos; Party,&quot; and is formed mainly ofex-service men who are ready to fight the revolutionaries should itbecome necessary. The programme of the party is political reformby evolution, not revolution. The new party is reported to bedeveloping rapidly, especially in Genoa, Liguria, Venetia and the newprovinces of the Italian Kingdom.Greece. A reliable informant, who is a Greek with a profoundknowledge of his countrymen and of the conditions prevailing in hiscountry,states that there is little probability that Bolshevism will breakout in Greece. In the towns the working men are in a minority;about 40 per cent, of them belong to unions with moderate politicalviews, the remainder are connected by family ties or old associationwith their employers. In the country districts the peasantry, apartfrom a little hired labour, work their own small holdings, and areaverse to any form of revolution which might deprive them of theirproperty. There is little poverty in Greece, though the increase inwages is considered to be incommensurate with the increased cost ofliving.Investigations into the recent plot against the life of M. Venizeloshave implicated about thirty-seven officers and six civilians, who areto be tried. The evidence seems to incriminate M. Stratos, one ofthe chief leaders of the Opposition, and also M. Alex. Mercatis,ex-Marshal of the Court, while the instigator of the conspiracy issaid to be M. Gounaris, at one time Prime Minister. It is reportedthat the Royalists in Switzerland have made overtures for a recon-ciliation on the basis that ex-King Constantine should definitelyresign his claim to the throne, and that the Crown Prince Georgeshould replace the present King.It is thought possible that, owing to the coalition of variousopposition groups, M. Venizelos may be defeated at the forthcomingelections. A revision in the franchise is, however, contemplated,whereby each member will represent 20,000 electors instead of18,000 as at present. This change would materially prejudice thechances of minorities such as the Royalists.Roumania. A competent observer who has recently returnedfrom Roumania views the situation in that country somewhatseriously; he states that the Agrarian party which swept the boardat the recent elections has communistic tendencies, and that theappearance of the Red Flag has become frequent.
There are indications that the people of Bessarabia are far fromsatisfied with the rfyirne imposed by the Central Government.With reference to the anti-Jewish movement in Eoumania (seeRoumania, Report 15) it is extremely unlikely, in view of therecent change of Government, that anything in the nature of apogrom will take place; the Jews, however, are reported to be ontheir guard and to have the support of the Socialist party.Czecho-Slovakia. Several notorious Bolsheviks from Boden-bach are at work among the Communists in the Komatou area, butin the districts of Brun, Dux, and Tetschen the Extremists arehampered by lack of funds. The Young Labour League, under thepresidency of Grunwald, with a membership of about 30,000, hasaddressed a letter to the Young Labour League in England, pressingfor co-operation and an exchange of views.According to a statement of the Czecho-Slovakian ForeignMinister, an agreement has been made with the Austrian Republicfor common defensive measures against reactionaries seeking torestore the old regime.JugO-Slavia. There is a tendency among the more prosperousfarmers to sympathise with Bolshevik doctrines. In this connectionit is interesting to note that the Communists have succeeded ingetting their candidate elected as leader of the Social DemocraticParty in Slovenia; the funds of the party and its newspaper haveconsequently passed into the hands of the Extremists. It is alsoreported that 1,200 students in Belgrade have enrolled themselvesas Bolsheviks.A considerable anti-JSntente propaganda is being carried on inRussian circles in Belgrade.Bulgaria. There is a reliable report to the effect that theTesniak (Bolshevik party in Bulgaria) recently received about7,000,000 roubles from Soviet Russia, and the success of the party atthe recent municipal elections is partly attributed to this financialassistance. The party now has a membership of 23,000 and is said tobe gaining in influence and importance. Its growth is mainly due toeconomic causes. The strike of railway workers and telegraphemployees, which is still in progress, is being largely engineered bythe Communists. An attempt by the employees of a sugar factoryin Bourgas to establish a local &quot;Soviet Republic&quot; on the 10th of Januarywas frustrated by the timely intervention of Government troopsThe workmen were armed with rifles and apparently had plenty ofammunition.Poland. The Bolshevik menace still continues, and consider-able reinforcements have been been received by the Red Armies onthe Polish frontier. The position of the Polish Army, as a result ofthe capture of Dvinsk and its junction with the Lettish Army, is,however, stronger than it was, but there is no doubt that the situationof Poland is critical, and that, should the Soviet Government decideto attack her, the consequences might be. serious. If Warsaw fellinto the hands of the Bolsheviks, the effect would be electrical andCommunist revolutions would almost certainly break out in Austria,
Czecho-Slovakia and throughout South-Western Europe generally.Poland has been described as the danger spot in Europe so far asBolshevism is concerned, and the description seems to be anaccurate one.The change of sovereignty from Germany to Poland on the wholeappears to have passed off quietly.Conditions of living in Poland show no signs of improvement, andthe health of the population is disquieting. Influenza, though of amilder form than last year, is prevalent and typhus is gaining ground,especially in Galicia.Tin coal supply is unsatisfactory. This is said to be due to arailway strike in Upper Silesia and to the difficulties raised by theCzechs in supplying coal from the Karwin district.Strikes of more or less importance are continually breaking out.Warsaw seems never to be without a strike. A Bill has been passedextending for another three mouths the regime of &quot; exceptionalconditions,&quot; which is equivalent to martial law.Russia.-In spite of their military successes, it is tolerablyclear that the Bolshevik leaders realise that the existence of theirGovernment depends largely on their being able to secure peace withthe outside world. An informant, who returned from Russia on the9th of January and who is said to have been in personal touch withsome of the most prominent Bolsheviks, states that the policy of theSoviet Government is to endeavour to undermine the Governmentsof the highly industrialised States, and not to attempt seriouspropaganda in agricultural States. The Bolsheviks are anxious forpeace with the Entente on the basis of the recognition by the SovietGovernment of the debts of the Czarist and Kerensky Governments,and they are quite willing to hand over the development of Russianindustrial and commercial enterprises to foreign experts, providedthat there is no interference in the system of Government by Soviets.This informant also.stated that the Bolsheviks have now abandonedthe idea of the nationalisation of land and have recognised peasant;proprietorship. The main difficulty against which the Bolshevikshave to contend is that of transport, and it is the inadequacy oftransport facilities which is reducing to a great extent the value oftheir victories over Koltchak and Denikin.At the Seventh Ail-Russian Congress of Soviets there wasconsiderable opposition to the Government, and its methods ofadministration, especially with regard to transport, were severely,criticised. In a recent article in Pravda the writer points out thatthe cardinal point in the economic position is the question oftransport, &quot; which is the life of the republic.&quot; He urges that thebest forces in the country &quot; must be flung into the improvement oftransport. The best qualified workmen must be flung into repairand locomotive shops, railway depots, and junctions. The peasantsand Red Army men must help in clearing the line and bringing inwood.&quot; The conversion of the Third Red Army into a Labour Armywas no doubt due to the realisation by the Government of thepressing need for the improvement of transport if the food supply ofthe urban population was to be maintained, and perhaps also to the fearthat if they returned to their villages the &quot; Red&quot; soldiers might begin to
think for themselves. Trotsky&apos;s explanationof the necessity for LabourConscription at the Third Eussian Congress of Soviets of NationalEconomy, which was held in Moscow on the 25th of January, however,would rather disillusion some of his admirers in Great Britain. Headvocated Labour Conscription because it gave the State the right totell a workman who was living in a village that he must leave hispresent employment and go somewhere else where his work wasrequired; he must work at whatever work the State might choose togive him, whether or not it suited his own convenience andinclination.Although the Bolsheviks profess to regard the raising of theblockade as a victory, Litvinoff declared in a recent interview withGeorge Lansbury that he considered the action of the Entente as an&apos; attempt to enforce upon Soviet Eussia certain changes in its economiccondition. He pointed out that the whole export and import tradeof Eussia had been nationalised and that it must therefore be tran-sacted through the Commissariat for Trade and Industry and its agencies.In this connection a Bolshevik wireless message, dated the 2nd ofFebruary, states that Litvinoff has been unanimously elected Chair-man of the Co-operative Societies by the Central Committee andthat the Soviet has authorised the transaction of business with foreigncountries. From this it would appear that the Soviet Governmenthad entirely taken over the Co-operative Societies in Eussia and thusprevented their becoming a possible tool of reaction in the hands ofthe counter-revolutionaries. In a wireless communication fromMoscow, it puts into the mouth of Lenin the following : &quot; The whole of the Soviet Eepublic will become an All-Russian Co-operative of the labouring masses this is theproblem before us.&quot; .According to the Secretary of the Joint Committee of the EussianCo-operative Organisations in London, if trade is to be opened withthe Eussian Co-operative Societies it will be necessary to give themcredit. The Americans and Norwegians have already given thiscredit: the former, 5,000,000 dollars, the latter, 5,000,000 kr.Conditions of life in Petrograd still appear to be very hard. TheMoscow Soviet was recently able to announce that owing to thevictories of the Eed Armies the bread ration would be increased asfrom the 1st of February to one pound (Eussian) a day for all menWorking an eight hours&apos; day. Further improvement in the foodsupply would depend on the transport facilities. It is reported thatfree refectories have been established in Moscow for workers andemployees. The system is not to remain in force after the foodcrisis is passed as a method of feeding the hungry, but as a commontable for workers, because they will find it more pleasant to sharebread and salt with their comrades than to remain at home, as theydid under the old rigime, for fear of their neighbours looking atthem and envying them their food. The six hours&apos; working day andthe whole holiday on Saturday have been abolished in Soviet Eussiaand the Bolshevik authorities are now trying to impose an 84-hourweek on the people. This change is said to be connected with theBolshevik attempt to revive the economic life of the community.
According to a statement published in the Communist (aChicago newspaper), a translation from a report which appeared inPravola, the revolutionary tribunal which was ordered to try thoseresponsible for the murder of the Czar and his family has convicted aman of the name of Yakhontov, who is said to have admitted that hehad organised the crime for the purpose of discrediting the SovietGovernment. He was sentenced to be shot, and thirteen other menwho were found guilty of robbing the victims were also condemnedto death.The situation in the Ukraine is somewhat obscure. There arenow apparently two rival factions struggling for power: one is agroup of Social Democrats headed by Tkatshenko, the other aGalician faction led by Petroushevich The former leader, who issupported by some of Petlura&apos;s adherents, has openly thrown in hislot with the Bolsheviks, and is patronised by Trotsky, who has issuedorders that the Independent Ukrainian Bolsheviks are to be respected.It is reported that Tkatshenko has already established himself atKieff. Lenin is said not to be in favour of enforcing a union betweenthe Ukraine and Soviet Bussia, but hopes that in course of timeinternational feeling will induce the Ukrainians to abandon theirdesire for independence.Baltic States. Peace was signed between Esthonia and theSoviet Government of Russia on the 2nd of February. It is reportedthat the differences between the Esthonian and Latvian Governmentswith regard to the frontier between the two countries has been sub-mitted to a Court of Arbitration under a British chairman.An anti-Bolshevik League has been formed at Reval, ostensiblyto counteract Bolshevik propaganda in Western Europe and in theStates bordering on Russia by means of a counter-agitation. Thereal object of the League, however; is to destroy the authority of theAllies in the Baltic States in the interests of Germany. A man ofthe name of Houutova and Generals Balahoviteh and Arsenieffappear to be the leaders of this movement. The Esthonians are saidto be supporting Balahovitch, who has the support of the JewishParty with funds. It was Balahovitch who arrested GeneralYudenitch, and his intention was to take his prisoner to Dorpat andto seize the funds belonging to the North-West Russian Army. Thiscoup was prevented by the Entente Missions.Finland. There are in Finland at the present time sixpolitical parties, the largest and most important being the SocialDemocratic Party, which holds 80 out of the 200 seats in Parliament.According to a statement of a member of this party the pro-Germanreactionaries in Finland are working in close touch with the Germanreactionaries in Berlin. They support Mannerheim, and are stillanxious for military intervention in Russia. Many of the highofficials belong to this party, and there are rumours of a projectedcoup d&quot;$tai. The Social Democrats attribute the present state ofthings to the weakness of the Prime Minister, Vennola, and are somuch dissatisfied that they are thinking of forcing a fresh election.If they were returned to power, they would put down the Germanintrigues and adopt a pro-British policy.[2292] B 5
The Bolsheviks continue their propaganda in Finland, especiallyin East Finland, but do not appear to have gained many convertsamong the skilled labouring classes. Considerable smuggling goeson across the Finnish frontier, and the smugglers who take in pro-visions to the Finnish Eeds in Petrograd return with Bolshevikliterature. It is said that they are paid 2,000 roubles for taking asmuch of this literature as can be carried in their pockets. The Finns,on the other hand, are reported to be carrying on propaganda inEast Karelia, where the rural population is more Finnish than Russian.A proportion of the population in this area is said to sympathise withthe Bolsheviks, but no outbreak of Bolshevism seems likely at present.It is reported that the Amnesty Bill in Finland has been carriedin the Cabinet by 8 votes to 4.Norway. The extremists appear to be making no headway.During 1919 the number of Trade Unions in Norway rose from32,487 to 140,299. A large number of labour unions, including theiron and metal workers, have handed in notices terminating theexisting wage agreements on the 1st of April. Industrial troublesmay be expected, therefore, unless satisfactory settlements can bereached before that date.It has been decided to hold a meeting of various labour associa-tions with a view to the formation of a common union. This stepmay be taken as an attempt by the Extremists to abolish individualtrade unions and to substitute for them a Syndicalist organisation.Sweden. After the recent Scand. vdan Bolshevik Congress, aprivate meeting was held in the house of Frederik Strom, at whichStang, Hellberg, Hoeglund, and other prominent ScandinavianBolshevik leaders were present. It was unanimously agreed that theproletariat in Scandinavia was not ready for a violent revolution.Stang stated that a revolutionary movement existed in Norway andin certain industrial circles in Sweden, but that in Denmark themovement was quite insignificant. He also said that in bothNorway and Sweden the movement was an intellectual one and thatits exponents were unlikely to resort to arms. A ScandinavianBolshevik Committee was formed as the result of this meeting, towhich Stang, Strom, and Hoeglund were elected. It was decided tomake an appeal for funds, and to endeavour to organise a generalstrike as a protest against the Russian blockade. Strom has givenup his post as editor of Politiken in order to devote himself toBolshevik propaganda. During the investigations at the trial ofHadjetlache (see Sweden, Report 11), Hellberg stated that over10,000,000 roubles had passed through the hands of the Bolshevik-representatives in Stockholm.It is estimated that the recent strikes in Sweden have so far costthe country 3,500,000 kronor.Denmark. About . 400 delegates from Norway, Sweden,Denmark, and Finland attended the Scandinavian Workmen&apos;sConference at Copenhagen on the 21st of January. The Norwegiandelegates adopted the Extremist attitude, and were anxious for theConference to declare its adherence to the Third International.They did not succeed, however, in carrying this policy, and a resolu-

About 400 delegates from Norway, Sweden,Denmark, and Finland attended the Scandinavian Workmen&apos;sConference at Copenhagen on the 21st of January. The Norwegiandelegates adopted the Extremist attitude, and were anxious for theConference to declare its adherence to the Third International.They did not succeed, however, in carrying this policy, and a resolu-
tion moved by Branting, the Swedish Socialist, for adherence to theSecond International was carried by a large majority. The generalattitude of the Conference was decidedly anti-Bolshevik, and theFinnish delegates expressed themselves as strongly opposed toBolshevism on account of their experience of its doctrines inpractice. In commenting on this Conference, Litvinoff was very-indignant, and said that Moscow would be astonished at the negativeresults. He has asked Mr. Lansbury to publish as little as possibleabout the Conference in the Daily Herald,Holland. There is reason to believe that the Extremistsintend to form in Holland a European bureau of the Third Inter-national, which will,work in close touch with Moscow. The Bolsheviksappear to have a well organised courier service between Moscow andthe United States of America via Amsterdam. Their intermediaryin Holland is said to be Rutgers, an engineer. He recently receiveda message from Trotsky instructing him to restrict Bolshevik pro-paganda for the time being to the United States, as peace negotiationswere pending with the Entente Powers. Wynkoop&apos;s Party isextremely inactive at the present time, and Communist meetingshave been poorly attended. So little interest was taken in thespeeches at a recent meeting that one Communist leader wasobserved to be reading Homer, and two others were sleeping peace-fully. The Union of Revolutionary Socialistic Intellectuals ofHolland, on the other hand, have been particularly active lately. InJanuary, at a meeting of this society, it was intimated that aninvitation had been received to attend the Conference of the Frenchassociation Le Groupe ClartS, to be held shortly at Berne. Twoof the leaders of the Dutch Society V. de Ligt, Helen Ankersmit,or Daniel de Lange were appointed to attend this meeting andinstructed to get into touch with the most radical members of LeGroupe GlwiU. The Dutch Intellectuals are also in touch with theYoung Students&apos; International Movement in Switzerland, and withthe Extremists in Berlin and Leipzig.Speaking at a recent meeting of the Dutch Social DemocraticParty, Troelstra declared that he belonged to the Left Wing of theSecond International. He disapproved of the Workmen&apos;s andSoldiers&apos; Councils of Russia, and expected most favouiable resultsfor Socialism from the British Labour Party&apos;s tactics. Troelstradisapproved of the policy of the German Independent Socialists, butacknowledged that they represented the real Socialism, and thattherefore many workers were joining them in opposition to theMajority Socialists.There has been a certain amount of discontent in the DutchArmy, but it is stated that the Minister of War has settled thegrievances of the troops. The intention of the Government is toreduce the strength of the army and to increase the police force.There is unrest among the transport workers in Holland, and onthe 12th of January a strike broke out. The men on the advice oftheir leaders, who urged them to reserve their strength for the greatconflict which was pending, returned to work the following day, butthey now appear to have decided by a great majority to come out onstrike.   The Trade Union Executive has published a resolution
however, declaring that the strike must be confined to the tradeinterested and not allowed to extend to other trades. This decisionmay be due to the fear of the more moderate trade unionists that thetransport workers who are well provided with funds and amongwhom there are many Syndicalists, may be inspired by theBolsheviks.[t is reported that a meeting was held at Solo (Java) by the&quot; Sarikat Islam &quot; and the N.I.P.&apos; Dutch-Indian Party). This was thefirst joint meeting of the two societies, and it became clear that theaim of each society was the same &quot;the liberation of the nativepopulation from capitalist oppression.&quot;One hundred and fifty of the 6,000 German prisoneis of war, whohave recently been liberated in Japan, are reported to have acceptedpolice posts in the Dutch Indies.Spain. Although the decree issued by the Governor ofBarcelona ordering the reopening of all factories and workshops onthe 26th of January has not been universally obeyed, the firmer actionof the Government, particularly the arrest of many of the Syndicalistleaders, has had a good effect, and the situation in Barcelona isimproving-now almost normal. The fear which was inspired amongthe working- class population by the Syndicalist police is reported tohave been one of the chief bars to a settlement, but the Chief of thePolice is of the opinion that there are now signs of a split in theranks of labour. The lock-out in the building trade at Madrid hascome to an end, but minor strikes continue to break out almost everyday throughout the country. The men belonging to the NationalFederation of Spanish Eailwaymen handed in notices for a strike onthe 20th of January, but at the same time a rival society, the Railway-men^ Mutual Federation, issued a statement disapproving a strikeand calling upon its members to remain at work. It is suggestedthat the proposed strike was organised by the railway companiesin the hope that the threatened interruption of work on the railwayswould enable them to push through the Cortes a Bill for the raisingof railway rates, which is meeting with considerable opposition. Theemployees on the Spanish railways are undoubtedly badly paid, andtheir demand for an increase in wages is justifiable. At the sametime, the service they give is amazingly bad, and an enormous amountof robbery takes place on the railways.A bag belonging to the Syndicalist leader Pestana, who, withanother prominent Syndicalist Noy de Sucre, disappeared after theattack on Granpero (see Spain, Report 15), has fallen into the handsof the police, and in the false bottom were found some interestingdocuments, in which a general strike was advocated, and theinfluence of German propaganda can be traced. The Germans arespending large sums of money in Spain. They are doing their bestto increase the anti-French feeling which exists in certain Spanishcircles, as well as to assist the Communist movement in Spain.The refusal of the Spanish Government to accept the appointmentof Dr. Rosen as German Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires at Madrid is probably dueto its knowledge of the German intrigues in Spain. Dr. Rosen wasformerly the German representative in Morocco, and has recentlybeen Charge d&apos;Affaires at The Hague, where he was responsible for
sending funds to the German Propaganda Bureau at Tsing Tau(see China, Beport 14).There is also evidence of Bussian money being behind theindustrial disturbances, and reliable information has been receivedthat 17,000,000 roubles, in Romanoff notes of 500 roubles each, hasrecently been smuggled into Spain by a certain Favilevitch, who isa representative of a trading concern in Milan. The roubles, whichwere deposited at the Banque Abadal y Cia. and subsequentlytransferred to the Banque de Paris, are now being sold by an agent,named Talarevitch, in Valencia at a rate of from 50 to 30 centimoseach. The proceeds of the sale of these notes goes into the codersof the Sindicato Unico, the Central Organisation of the TradesUnions, which is practically a Workmen&apos;s Soviet.The recent mutiny among the troops quartered at Saragossa hasagain brought into prominence the position of the military juntas.A Royal decree has been published appointing &quot;Commissions&quot; toinquire into general conditions in the army, but excluding alltechnical matters. The creation of these commissions was intendedto suppress the juntas, but it is reported that as a matter of fact thecommissions are working in close co-operation with the juntas.There is reason to suppose that the King favours the juntas, becausehe considers that the army is the principal supporter of the throne;on the other hand, it has been suggested that there is an under-stauding between the Military Party and the Republicans.Portugal. Ferdinandes Costa, who formed a Cabinet upon theresignation of Cardosa, only remained in power one day. HisGovernment failed to obtain the support of the popular parties in theChamber, and the following incident not unnaturally ended in hisimmediate resignation. On the lfith of January a few hotheads madetheir way into the private room of the Minister of the Interior, andwith revolvers pointed at his head forced him to proceed to theBelem Palace and give in his resignation there and then. As aresult of this incident, the country was practically without aGovernment until the 21st of January, when a Cabinet was formedunder the leadership of Domingos Pereira. The latter has promiseda non-party policy, an honest administration, and the avoidance ofsuperfluous expenditure, and, on these assurances, has received thepromise of support from the Democratic Majority and also from theLiberal Minority.The situation in Portugal is not free from anxiety. The fall inthe exchange has brought business practically to a standstill, pricesare rising, and in consequence unrest is increasing. There are signsthat the Extremists intend, if possible, to make capital out of thesituation.Numerous strikes are in progress, but only in a very minor degreecan they ho attributed to Bolshevik influence. The Syndicalistsare in a minority, and though sometimes successful in causing astoppage of work, have really little influence with their fellow-workers.Owing to persecutions in France, Spain, and the United States,the I.W.W. appear to have transferred the centre of their activitiesto Lisbon, where an International Syndicalist Conference has beenarranged to take place on the 27th of February.
A strike of office and shop assistants broke out on the20th of January at Lourenco Marques. It is considered possible thatcertain Portuguese agitators with Bolshevik tendencies are behindthe strikers. The employees of British firms have joined thestrikers, notwithstanding an offer of protection to them by theGovernor-General.Turkey. The main-spring of most of the Pan-Islamic intrigue,which is directed from Constantinople, has been located in asub-section of the Turkish Ministry of War, which is now supposedto be dissolved. The Pan-Islamic agents in Europe communicatewith Constantinople through an agency in Italy, whose address is notyet known.There was a meeting at St. Moritz about the 7th of January, atwhich Djemal, Talaat, Muktar, Djavid Bey, Jamaludin (Mulla, Sheik-ul-Islam), and Amir Shakib Arsalan were present. Talaat and Jamalcame from Berlin to organise the meeting and to find out whetherthe Sultan would stand by Enver and the Bolshevik alliance in casethey decided to attack in Asia Minor. The preliminary Treatybetween Enver and the Russians was accepted by all the parties, anda copy has been sent to Syria and Turkey for approval through theItalian Consul at Lausanne. As soon as Eeisul returns this Treatywith his remarks, Amir Shakib Arsalan will go to Russia as arepresentative of Feisul. Up till the 23rd of December Enver was inBerlin working to establish an alliance between the Germans and theBolsheviks and to unify the Arab, Turk, and Egyptian movements asa preliminary to his projected invasion of Asia Minor. Feisulappears to be playing with Enver until he can get a guarantee of theindependence of Arabia and Syria recognised by the Russians and theSultan.The Pan-Islamic pamphlet written by Kidwai (see TurkeyReport 15), and published by the Central Islamic Society in Londonis now known to have been translated into Turkish, and circulatedby prominent members of the Red Crescent Society, under theleadership of Dr. Essadi Pasha. A link has thus been establishedbetween the Central Islamic Society and the Red Crescent Societyin Constantinople.There is evidence to show that the Young Turks are sending armsand ammunition via Italy to the East; posts are being established inSicily and along the Adriatic coast for the shipment of munitions ofwar. In this connection the raid on the ammunition dump on theGallipoli peninsula on the 28th of January, which resulted in theseizure of 80,000 rifles, 500,000 rounds of ammunition, and 33 machineguns, is of interest. It appears that Enver Pasha has alreadygiven orders for local disturbances and the perpetration of bomboutrages in Mesopotamia, and he is also credited with being in favourof a coup d&apos; tai in Constantinople. He, Talaat Pasha, and DjemalPasha are reported to have recently held a meeting at Zurich, atwhich the two latter were opposed to the projected coup dfitat.A new secret Pan-Islamic Society, called the &quot;Mouvahidin(Monotheists) Society/&apos; is reported, with centres at Damascus,Baalbek, Cairo, Tanta, Aleppo, Baghdad, and other places. TheSociety aims at securing by any and every means the emancipation
of Moslem countries from foreign protection &apos;or domination, andstands for the maintenance of the Ottoman Kaliphate over theTurkish Empire; it has sent delegations to Egypt, Syria, theCaucasus, Afghanistan, Tunisia, Morocco, and India, and has issuedproclamations calculated to arouse the religious fanaticism of theMohammedan world. This Society, which so far does not appear tohave been definitely established in the countries where it is intendedto become a political force, has no doubt been founded as a resultof the efforts which have recently been made to form a Pan-IslamicConfederation, and may have been the outcome of the Pan-IslamicConference held at Sivas by Mustapha Kemal. Another conferenceof the same kind was planned to be held on the 15th of January, butso far no information with regard to this meeting has been received.Central Asia. Reliable information tends to show that,notwithstanding their determined efforts, the Bolsheviks have so farfailed to rally the Moslems of Central Asia to their side. Nor doesthere appear to be any great enthusiasm in this part of Asia for theKhalifate or for Turkey. The pan-Islamic propaganda has failed toexcite the religious fanaticism of the people, probably becauseit is merely a cloak for political agitation in the interests of theBolsheviks and Young Turks, and has no real religious feelingbehind it.The intimacy between the Bolsheviks and the Afghans continues.A Bolshevik Mission, headed by Dr. Suritz, has reached Kabul fromRussia, and the Amir is undoubtedly in close touch with theBolsheviks.The Bolshevik forces in the Askabad area are increasing. Thereis a report to the effect that a detachment of Germans, probablyofficers, has arrived at Tashkent. As evidence that the Germansare supplying the Soviet Government with materials it is worthnoting that a reliable report states that Bolshevik troops on theTashkent front are wearing German uniforms.The new Bolshevik officials at Tashkent are less unpopular thantheir predecessors, and the Turcomans are consequently less activelyhostile towards the Bolsheviks than was formerly the case.China.-Chinese Bolshevik agents who are believed to havebeen trained in Russia have been arrested in Central China. Theirpropaganda, which is suited to local taste, promises the abolition ofmilitary Governors, taxes, and the army as soon as the Bolsheviksarrive in China.Japan. There is an increasing opposition in Japan to anyfurther military adventures in Siberia. Siberian Bolsheviks arealleged to have distributed a good deal of Bolshevik literature inTokyo and Yokohama, but there is little evidence in the Japanesepress to show that Bolshevism is looked upon as a serious menace.It is not thought that it is likely to make much headway in China orin other countries where Japanese interests are involved.West Indies.Jamaica.-As the dockers returned to work at their old scaleof pay, the shipping agents have decided to grant a 45 per cent.
increase of wages. For the time being there are no strikes in theisland. With regard to the recent epidemic of strikes, it isinteresting to note that this is the first time in the history of the colonythat large bodies of men have been on strike without the policehaving been called upon to fire a single shot. This is due largely tothe fact that the attitude of the vast majority of the strikers waspeaceful and that the strikes were bond fide in character.. The Legislature has adopted a report recommending an increaseof pay to Civil Servants, and the Governor has issued instructionsthat all increases on salaries up to  800 shall be paid forthwith.Increases on salaries above this amount must be referred for linalapproval to the Colonial Secretary.St. Vincent. According to a recent article in the &quot; NegroWorld,&quot; a newspaper in the United States of America, the Governorof St. Vincent made a grave mistake when he &quot; insulted the intelli-gence of a loyal people&quot; by prohibiting the entry of the &quot; NegroWorld &quot; into St. Vincent. &quot; The result of the prohibition,&quot; it isstated, &quot; is that there are not sufficient copies to go round in theneighbouring island of Grenada.&quot; In connection with thesuppression of the &quot; Negro World&quot; George Tobias, treasurer ofthe Black Star Line, wrote: &quot; Let the pale-faced British Governorsuppress the &quot;Negro World.&quot; The time will come when they willhave to run for their very lives with shoes in their hands, to findrefuge in the Caribbean Sea.&quot;: Trinidad. Further information with regard to the strike ofstevedores in Port of Spain, which culminated in the disturbances at&quot;the beginning of last December, shows that, apart from the unrestcaused by racial propaganda, the strike was directly engineered bythe Trinidad Working Men&apos;s Association. This association, whichwas first founded in 1897 has recently been revived by two men,Headley and James Braithwaite. There is little doubt that the ratesof wages in the island have been too low, and the more intelligentemployers are now beginning to realise that this has enabledagitators to cause trouble among their workmen. The Chamber ofCommerce has consequently acted on the Governors suggestion toconvene a Conference to study the economic conditions of labour, andit is also proposed to request the Government to appoint a committeeto enquire into the question of wages. Meanwhile racial propagandacontinues, and there is always a danger of further disturbances, moreespecially as the failure of the police to control the rioting has elatedthe more turbulent section of the strikers. A Commission has beenappointed to enquire into the conduct of the police.Australia. The referendum on the proposal to increase thelegislative powers of the Government in regard to Trade and Com-merce and the Nationalisation of Monopolies, has resulted in thedefeat of both suggestions, though in neither case by a very heavymajority.The strikes of the Australian Marine Engineers and the BrokenHill Miners still continue. The latter have refused to pay anyrent and have organised their expenses on a co-operative basis,
Supplies are ordered wholesale and are drawn against coupons.Cooking, washing, boot-repairing and the making of clothes are alsobeing carried out on the communal system.The &quot; One Big Union &quot; scheme is reported to have been started inNew South Wales.Canada. It is reported from Toronto that energetic effortsare being made to revive the &quot;One Big Union&quot;; also that thesupporters of this movement are terrorising the northern lumbercamps by strikes and the open display of firearms.The trial and sentence of R. B. Russell, the Winnipeg strikeleader, continues to excite the Extremists in Canada. The leadersof the Labour Party are endeavouring to provoke industrial unrestas a reprisal, and are urging British labour to join in a generalstrike to compel the Government to release Russell.Mr. Coote, M.P. for Tyrone, a member of the Ulster deputation,met with a hostile reception from Sinn Feiners on his arrival inVancouver.It is reported that the Canadian Government has acceded to arequest from the Canadian Jews Congress that Canadian Jewsmight have permission to bring their relations from Southern Russiaand the Ukraine to Canada. A committee has been formed to makethe necessary arrangements.The Quebec Legislature has adopted a resolution stronglydisapproving of the demand of the National Catholic Labour Unionsfor the prohibition of the export of agricultural products in order toreduce the cost of living.South Africa. There seems to be considerable labour unrestthroughout the country, and the attitude of the Extremists is givingsome cause for anxiety to the more sober sections of the LabourParty. The strike of the municipal employees at Durban, as aprotest against the dismissal of the assistant Town Clerk early lastmonth, was of a revolutionary character: the strikers, who tem-porarily were in control of the town, hoisted the Red Flag over theTown Hall and proclaimed a &quot; Board of Control,&quot; a species of Sovietgovernment. The strike was settled through the efforts of an officialof the Union Government on the 10th of January, and one of theclauses in the agreement was that full indemnity should be granted&quot; to all concerned with any action taken by the Board of Control.&quot;The general opinion is that this clause in the agreement was a sur-render to the mutineers, which may have disastrous consequences inthe future.In addition to the strike at Durban, there are signs that theremay be trouble from the railwaymen and from other sections of theindustrial community.An uneasy feeling is reported to prevail in Pretoria with regardto the immediate future, and there is a general suspicion that therevolutionary Socialists and Bepublicans are planning some kind ofoutbreak to disturb the elections, which are expected to take placeearly next month. The instinct of the majority of the Dutch popu-lation, however, is law-abiding, and it is probable that the efforts ofVan der Horst and other Extremists, who are urging that bloodshed
is justifiable if it will promote Republicanism, will merely result inthe South African Party receiving support that it otherwise wouldnot obtain. General Smuts has expressed himself strongly againstthe Republican agitation which he associates with Bolshevism.It is reported that a representative of the British Indians in theTransvaal has started for England in order to lay the grievances ofhis compatriots before the Secretary of State for India.United States Of America.-The Department of Justicehas made another important round up of Communists in over sixtydifferent cities, and has arrested about 5,000 suspects, more than halfof whom, it is believed, can be deported. Nearly all the arrestedpersons are aliens, and are being charged with advocating the over-throw of the Government by violence. Any American citizensamong the prisoners will be handed over to the State authorities tobe prosecuted as anarchists.Meanwhile the police are active against the I.W.W. At Nebraska,sixteen members of the organisation were sentenced to short termsof imprisonment, the fact of their being members of the I.W.W.being considered sufficient evidence to convict them of vagrancy.In Oregon, six prominent I.W.W. leaders were convicted of violatingthe State Criminal Syndicalism Act; two of them were sentenced toten years in the penitentiary and fined 1.000 dollars. At Wichitathirty-two members of the I.W.W. were convicted on various chargesof conspiracy and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging fromtwo and a half to nine years. It is believed that the I.W.W. isbeginning to feel the effects of the stringent measures which arebeing taken against it, and that it will not be able to record anyincrease in membership during the present winter. It is certainly infinancial difficulties, possibly owing to its not having received anexpected subsidy from Martens&apos; Soviet Bureau.The formation throughout the country of numerous anti-Radicalassociations is reported. The most hopeful method for combatingBolshevik propaganda is known as the Minneapolis plan. It con-sists in tihe organisation of a corps of trained speakers who debateagainst radical orators in any places the latter may select. Asomewhat similar plan of campaign has been adopted in New YorkCity by the Social Service Commission of the Protestant EpiscopalDiocese. These private attempts to counteract the work of theExtremists are all the more valuable because there is some reasonto anticipate that the drastic action of the Government mayproduce a re-action in favour of the radicals. The Anti-SeditionBill, which has passed the Senate and is now before Congress,is being fiercely assailed by Mr. Gompers. It contains clausesproviding for the deportation of aliens and also for the infliction ofheavy penalties on American-born citizens convicted of seditionagainst the State. The Graham Bill, which provided the deathpenalty for certain cases of sedition, was defeated, and theSterling Bill, which dealt with press censorship, was considerablymodified. The action of the Republican majority in the House ofAssembly of New York State, in refusing to allow five Socialistmembers to take their seats in the Assembly until an investigationhad been held to see whether or not they were in sympathy with the
Soviet system of government, has also been severely criticised.Judge Hughes denounced the action of the Republicans as being aviolation of all political rights.During his examination by the Foreign Affairs Committee of theSenate, Ludvig Martens declared that, as &quot; Russia has demonstratedher ability to exist against the rest of the world,&quot; Lenin has nowabandoned his idea of a world revolution, and believes &quot; that a periodof reconstruction &quot; has been reached. He also added that there isin the treasury of Soviet Russia a sum of 9,100,000,000 roubleswhich it is desired to spend in foreign countries on the purchaseof necessities. The latter would appear to correct the formerstatement, and to explain the present desire for peace of the RussianBolsheviks.In a letter written last November, which has only recentlyreached Strom in Sweden, Martens describes the position of hisorganisation in America as critical. He stated, however, that only apart of the  90,000 recently received from Strom had been confiscated.He has now offered the Government to provide free transport toRussia for the Russian Radicals, and this offer has led to manyBolsheviks applying to the Department of Immigration for passports.The most important application of this kind has come from theSeattle branch of the Union of Russian Workers, which protestsagainst the &quot;unwarrantable&quot; arrests to which its members havebeen subjected. The American press has likened the journey of the&quot; Soviet Ark&quot; (s.s. &quot; Buford&quot;), which was employed to conveythe Bolsheviks back to Russia, to that of the &quot;Mayflower,&quot; anda writer in the Daily Herald has painted a moving picture of thearrival of these undesirables in their native land. Emma Goldman,one of their number, who was apparently &quot; wet with tears,&quot; declaredthat she felt &quot;the same emotion entering Russia as my Jewishpeople felt thousands of years ago upon entering the Inner Temple.&quot;The lady, however, announced her intention of keeping in touchwith the United States of America, the ungrateful capitalist countrywhich had deported her.The American Federation of Labour, which at the close of lastNovember numbered over 4,000,000 members, has issued in pamphletform the views set forth at its recent Conference in Washington.In view of the feelings which have been evoked in some quarters inGreat Britain by the application of the principle of the sliding scalefor wages, it is interesting to note that the Conference held that&quot; the belief that wages should be fixed on a cost of living basis ispernicious and intolerable,&quot; in that it negatives all progress. TheConference &quot;insists,&quot; in view of the economic conditions nowprevailing throughout the world, that it is &quot;the immediate duty ofthe Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles.&quot;The struggle continues between the Radical and Moderate leadersfor the control of the Federation of Labour. Up to the presenttime the Moderates seem to maintain their power. They havesucceeded in arranging a liaison with the farmers&apos; organisation (seeUnited States of America, Report 14) (through its Conservativesection and not through the non-partisan league which is dominated,by Townley, as was proposed by the Radical section of theFederation.
The Non-Partisan League continues, it is said, to show considerablevitality. Not only does it have threads which extend throughthirteen western States, but its activities stand to obtain a greaterradius through its connection with the newly-formed National LabourParty. The League thus has large opportunities to become aneffective agent for the forces of disruption.* The question with regard to which trouble will probably arisebetween organised Labour and the Government is the return of therailways to private ownership. President Wilson has issued a decreefixing the 31st of March as the date for this to take place, and theExtremists are already threatening a general strike should effect begiven to this decree.Sinn Fein propaganda is very active ; de Valera was presentedwith the Freedom of New York City his immediate predecessors inthe honour being the King of the Belgians and the Prince of Wales.The sale of the 10,000,000 dollars of non-negotiable, non-interestbearing Irish Republic certificates which are being offered for sale inthe United States has received an impetus owing to the fact that theRoman Catholic Archbishop of New York has subscribed 1,000 dollarsto the loan. It is possible that this prelate looks upon his subscriptionas a form of charity at any rate it is certain that the Roman Catholicpriests are encouraging the sale of these certificates in their churches.The.loan does not seem to be so popular in financial circles, and awriter in the well-known financial newspaper The Street has describedit as &quot; a charity drive half-masked as a bond issue to swindle theinexperienced.&quot;The society known as &quot; The Friends of Freedom for India &quot; wasrecently severely criticised by Jim Larkin, who asserted that the Irishleaders hated the Hindus and would not have them in Ireland.The Mercantile Bank of New York State is the principal bankemployed by the Friends of Freedom.The promoters of the negro movement continue their activities,and an attempt is being made to federate the various colouredorganisations in order to increase their political influence. Thisassociation is to be called the Joint Protective Association.John E. Robinson is its president; Harriet Nichols, secretary ; andJames Randolph, treasurer. It is proposed to hold a hugedemonstration in the spring to arouse the people of Greater NewYork against the practice of mob law. Marcus Garvey continues tourge the &quot;scattered sons of Ethiopia to make up their minds andhearts to fight, if needs be, and die for the principle of a free Africa.&quot;A new negro journal, The Weekly Review, has been started, withMr. Donald McLean as editor. With one exception, all the editorsare connected with Garvey&apos;s movement. In the first number of thepaper there is an article on England&apos;s present economic position byArthur King, who suggests that this is the moment to deprive GreatBritain of her colonies. &quot; In our upward struggle we cannot affordto let any nation or race stand in our path, and no nation stands somuch in our path to-day as England. . . . The fall of imperialEngland is necessary to our future.&quot;Cuba. Owing to the continuance of the dock strike at Havana,and to the fear of a general strike throughout the country, the
President has obtained the consent of Congress to the suspension onthe constitutional guarantees for a period of sixty days.South America.Chile.-An analysis of the strikes which have taken placeduring the past four years show that in 70 per cent, of them theworkmen have been partially or wholly successful. During the pastyear the number of labour disputes has greatly increased, and thegeneral strike is rapidly becoming the favourite weapon of theChilean working man.A correspondent in Peru writes that the Chileans who were pro-German during the war are now doing their utmost to ingratiatethemselves with the British; in this connection it must be borne inmind that Peruvians are especially alert to detect any signs ofpartiality for Great Britain among Chileans.Colombia.---It is reported that natives recently attacked arubber plantation 80 miles east of Colombia and killed seventeenpersons. No white people were involved in the affray. An expedi-tion has been despatched to restore order.Peru. The political situation for the time being is calm, thoughit is rumoured that disturbances are being fomented in the provincesby the parties of Signor Pardo and Dr. Durande. The industrialsituation has improved, and recently there have been no strikes.Mexico. The New York Times reports that a Japanesemerchant ship, escorted by a Japanese cruiser, recently arrived at aport on the West coast of Mexico and unloaded a cargo of arms andammunition for Carranza&apos;s Government. The Japanese Ambassadorat Washington has denied that his Government has directly orindirectly countenanced the supply of munitions of war to Mexico.The Mexican Socialist Party has now definitely changed its nameto the Communistic Party, and a committee has been appointed toconsider how, best to organise a Latin-American Communistic Congresson which all the Radicals of Central and Southern America are to berepresented.Fiji Islands.-It is reported that 1,500 Indian labourers atSuva have struck work, demanding an increase of wages in view ofthe increase in the cost of living.PART II.The Situation in Egypt.The presence of the Milner Commission in Egypt has undoubtedlyeased the tension. With the exception of the Extremists underMarcos Hanna Bey, President of the Cairo Committee of the EgyptianDelegation, and Ulema (Mahommedan Priests led by the Dignitariesof the El Azhar Mosque and Theological University), all the moreresponsible Egyptians seem anxious to profit by the presence of the
Commission, in order to find a basis for agreement with the BritishGovernment which will be compatible with the interests of allparties, and may render easier any further efforts towards indepen-dence. The result has been the formation of two parties among theNationalists; the Extremists under Marcos Hanna Bey, who stillbelieve that Zaghloul Pasha will obtain complete and immediateindependence for Egypt, and the Moderates, under Ali Maher Bey, amember of the Egyptian Delegation, who consider that half a loaf isbetter than no bread and, it is thought, are taking steps to causeZaghloul to modify his hitherto intransigent attitude. The departureof Ali Maher Bey for Paris on the 8th January would appear toconfirm this view.The attempt by a Copt to assassinate the Egyptian PrimeMinister has been claimed by the Nationalists as a convincingproof that their cause is a purely national one. Too much weightshould not be attached to this argument. The Copts form a religiousminority; many of them are rich and owe their wealth to theprosperity given to Egypt by British administration; further, theyknow that they would have little voice in the administration of anindependent Egypt which would be purely Mahommedan. Incidentsare not lacking to show that the Copts&apos; apparent devotion tothe Nationalist cause is prompted rather by fear of their Mahommedancountrymen than by a desire for the independence of their country.They realise that to be anti-British is safer than to be anti-Nationalist,but their secret preference for British government might easily beconfirmed (for what it is worth) were their leaders assured that theyran no risk in admitting it.The difference of opinion concerning the great engineering projectson the White and Blue Nile between Sir Murdoch Macdonald,Adviser to the Public Works Department, and Sir William Willcockshas been rendered more serious by the publication by Sir WilliamWillcocks of a pamphlet in which he accuses Sir Murdoch of (1)falsifying accounts of the Gauge Readings at Senaar; (2) deliberatelyforging records, knowing that he would thereby cause loss or injuryto the public; (3) signing a document of which every original line iseither a falsification or is grossly inaccurate in the face of the officialfacts or records. Such a quarrel has not failed to lower Britishprestige in Egypt, but the Nationalist Party does not appear to wishto make undue capital out of it for their own cause. The exactreason for this is not quite clear; it is, however, possible that thesuperstitious reverence with which every Egyptian regards the Nileand anything affecting it, may in part explain their present attitude.The whole question must also be an unpleasant reminder to theNationalists of the importance to an independent Egypt of abenevolent control of the Upper Waters of the Nile by the Britishas occupiers of the Sudan. It touches on one of the outstandingfeatures of Egyptian history the relations of North and South.From the days of the Shepherd Kings the southern tide has ebbedand flowed, but it is never still; nor would it be unreasonable to saythat were the restraining hand of British control removed, the Southwould endeavour- once again to assert its superiority over the North.Such thoughts as these might well make the most violent of theIndependents pause,
As already stated, the Al Azhar University must now becounted among the Extremist party of the Nationalists. This wasnot always the case, and the suggestion has been made that, had afirm warning been issued to the heads of the University, they wouldcontinue to enjoy their rights and privileges so long as they remainedneutral on political questions, it would have been understood andaccepted. The Al Azhar is, above all, a Theological College. Itsstudents are Arabs, who wear the national dress, and for the mostpart speak only Arabic; they are not Effendis, they do not speakFrench or English, and their religion and its study are the causes oftheir presence at Al Azhar. The heads and professors probably stillregard the secret political meetings which, undisturbed by the police,are being held within the austere precincts of the Mosque, as degradingto its sacred purpose and tradition. In the meantime, the Al Azharstudents hold meetings in the Mosque, and are prominent in thedisturbances outside, with, at least, the tacit consent of theprofessors. This sacred College has considerable influence in Egypt,and its avowed espousal of the Extremists&apos; cause must be verysatisfactory to Zaghloul and his party.The present leaders of the Nationalist movement would beunlikely to favour any of the so-called Bolshevik or Communisttheories. Like Zaghloul himself, they are for the most part largelandowners, and would have every cause to fear the spread ofBolshevik ideas in. Egypt. If Bolshevism came, it would be throughthe Fellaheen, who in many respects are nut unlike the BussianMoujik. There is little doubt that they would gladly welcomeBolshevism as a means of becoming owners of the soil which theynow work for others. It is remarkable that in all the disturbancesthe Fellaheen have, whenever possible, taken the opportunity topillage and plunder. They want the land, and it is doubtful whetherthey have much sympathy with the present Nationalist leaders,though they may consider independence as a first step towardsobtaining it.It is reported that the real leaders of the Egyptian Nationalists,in so far as the movement is a Pan-Islamic one, are Abdul HamedSaid, Abdul Malik Hamsa, and Mahomed Ali, all of whom areresiding at Geneva, and are believed to be in constant communicationwith Berlin.Notes on the Organisation of Government inSoviet Russia.[The following notes on the theory and practice of the system ofgovernment in Bolshevik Russia are supplied from informationreceived from (1) A young Russian business man. He is not apolitician, but was strongly opposed to the old regime. He workedfor the Red Cross during the war, as his eye-sight was not goodenough for the army. When the Bolsheviks came into power hewas appointed Secretary to a Committee for the relief of warprisoners. His duties brought him in contact with many personsof importance. He left Russia in March 1919, but there is noreason to suppose that the administrative system which he describes
has much changed since that date; (2) An officer recently escapedfrom Soviet Russia; and (3) Dr. Martini, who worked for two yearsin Moscow and in other parts of Russia for the Red Cross on behalfof the nationals of the Allied Powers.]In theory the administration of the country, both local and central,&quot;is vested in Soviets, i.e., committees of representatives of industrial,agricultural, military, and casual groups * which control the membersof the groups which have elected them and are entitled to sendrepresentatives to larger Soviets. In a city there is a Central Soviet,which is formed from the representatives of the smaller Soviets, andthe size of which is always tending to increase as fresh Soviets areformed. The only qualification which is laid down for membershipto a Soviet is that every.member must be a worker and not an&quot;exploiter&quot; of the work of others. In rural areas the system ofSoviets is much the same as in cities. Each area is dividedinto a government or district and sub-districts; the headquartersof the district is usually the most important town in the area; thistown and any other town in the district has its own soviet, formedas has already been described. Each sub-district (Uizd) is dividedinto smaller districts (Wollost), comprising small groups of villages.There are Wollost Soviets and delegates and Uizd Soviets anddelegates; there is also a District Conference of Soviets, which isthe central authority for the district, and is formed by delegatesfrom the town Soviets and from representatives from the countrySoviets. These latter are usually delegates from the sub-districts,but the system is erratic and, as often as not, the rural population isrepresented by delegates from regiments or other Soviets which mayhave been formed in the area.Above the Soviets of towns and districts there is the AU-RussianCongress of Soviets, which meets periodically. The seventh Congresstook place recently. The number of members of this assembly hasvaried from about 500 to about 1,200. The Congress is composed ofdelegates from the great cities and towns, from the DistrictConferences of Soviets, from the various town Soviets in the countrydistricts, and sometimes from the sub-district Soviets. The system ofrepresentation is elastic, and the actual representation by delegatesappears largely to depend upon the extent of the political influenceof any particular district or soviet.The All-Russian Congress of Soviets theoretically is the supremerepository of power in the country, as according to the Bolshevikprinciple the whole power of government should be in the hands ofthe workmen&apos;s delegates. There is a Central Executive Committeeof the Congress, consisting of about 100 persons, the president ofwhich, in theory at any rate, is the head of the Soviet Republic.This Central Executive Committee, which is empowered to issuestatutes that have the force of law, presumably derives its powersfrom the Congress, but, to all intents and purposes, it acts as anindependent body, and apparently all that the Congress does when itmeets is to pass a resolution of confidence in the Committee.* Apparently there is. no limit to the number of groups which may form SovietsIt is open to any body of peoplo with common interests and political aims to organise aSoviet. Theoretically the British colony in Moscow might form themselves into aSoviet and so havo the right to send a representative to the City Soviet.
Another executive body, which is supposed to be subordinate to theCongress, is the Soviet of Commissariats, which is empowered to issuedecrees that have the force of law; it is composed of the chiefmembers of the Government, about fifteen in number, and about fortyof their principal subordinates, and may be looked upon as theCabinet. Lenin presides over this Soviet, and may be said to occupythe position of Prime Minister.In order to understand the working of the legislative andexecutive machinery of government under the Bolsheviks, it must beborne in mind that every big city and Government has its ownCongress of Soviets with legislative powers within its own area equalto those of the Ail-Russian Congress of Soviets, and also that everycity and every sub-district has its own executive organisation ofCommissariats for War, Foreign and Home Affairs, Economics, &amp;c.These local Congresses of Soviets and Soviets of Commissariats may,on their own initiative, take legislative and executive action whichhas the force of law within their area of authority, a system whichexplains the immense powers wielded by a man such as Zinovieffin Petrograd.The Central Government has succeeded in establishing to someextent its authority throughout the country by appointing repre-sentatives of its own on the various local Commissariats, who workside by side with the local officials, and also by sending specialcommissions from the Central Commissariat into local areas.It may be gathered from this multiplication of authorities thatthe system of government is both cumbrous and elaborate, and it isscarcely overstating the case to say that the Bolshevik regime is theapotheosis of bureaucracy: just as Republican France adopted thoNapoleonic organisation of administration, so the Bolsheviks incarrying out their Communist ideals have adopted the bureaucraticsystem of government which existed under the Czars. The reasonfor this is that the new masters of Russia have been forced torely upon the advice and services of men steeped in the old traditions,because there was no one else capable of carrying on the workof administration; whereas the Czar&apos;s Government, however, onlyconcerned itself in certain phases of social life, the Soviet Govern-ment seeks to regulate every act and movement of the citizen and tointerfere in every detail, of his daily life.It would be impossible for such a complicated system of govern-ment to be worked smoothly if the entire machinery of Soviets andcommissariats were really freely elected and left to themselves toperform their various functions. It is obvious that if there wereany freedom in Bolshevik Russia, political dissensions and localinterests would soon reduce to chaos the whole elaborate machineryof Soviets. The new reformers of the world have solved theproblem of their legislative and executive organisation by havingonly one political party with any power; in theory the workers,whatever their political views may be, rule in Bolshevik Russia; inpractice the country is governed by the Communist party, which,it is estimated, numbers about 15,000. The party is admirablyorganised and disciplined; in every locality the Communists electdelegates to be members of a central committee of their party, andthis committee is the real centre of power within the district; it
controls both the legislature and the executive. In the legislaturethis control is simple in the extreme, for whenever a vote is takenonly the votes of the Communists are counted. The control of theexecutive is more complicated, but equally efficacious. It is carried outby means of a system of espionage as elaborate as any that has everbeen devised. Each department or commissariat is administered bya number of paid officials who are non-political, but who are usuallyopposed to the Bolshevik rfyime; among them, however, there arealways a few Communists whose business it is to see that nothingis done in the department without the approval of the CommunistParty, to spy upon the officials and to deprive them of their postsand to punish any of them who incur their displeasure. This systemof terrorism is said to work admirably, with the result that theCommunist Party controls every branch of the executive. The RedArmy is controlled in the same way, by means of Communist agentswho serve in the field. It is reported that every officer has aCommunist behind him.The whole of this work of espionage is in the hands of theChrezvychaika, a secret police organisation and originally an off-shootof the Central Committee of the Communist Party, all of whosemembers are either Letts or Communists. The leader of thisorganisation, Dzerzhinsky, is probably the most powerful man inSoviet Russia, although LeDin may still remain the foremost personagein the Republic.The Chrezvychaika is officially described as dealing with thefollowing subjects: (1) Counter-revolution; (2) Speculation; (3)Administrative offences; (4) Sabotage. Its agents are everywhere,and it is said to be the dominating influence which maintains theBolsheviks in power. It resembles in its character and methods theOkrana of the old Czarist regime, but it is more powerful and itsduties are far more numerous. It does not appear to be anyexaggeration to say that the whole life of the people is dependenton the Chrezvychaika, for its powers are practically unlimited. It hasthe right of arrest and has its own Court. If a man is told that hiscase is to be taken up by the Chrezvychaika, he knows that he is in adesperate position and that he will probably be shot. The disciplineof the Chrezvychaika is excellent; and its strength lies in the factthat its members are fanatics, who do not work for money, but inorder to carry through to the end a political programme. It is saidthat when Dzerzhinsky and his associates meet together they con-stitute the real Government of Soviet Russia.The Political Situation in Soviet Russia.(From notes supplied by Dr. Martini, December 12,1919.)Although there are now two distinct parties among the Bolsheviks-the Extremists headed by Dzerzhinsky and tbe Moderates byLenin-the hostility between the rival factions does not appearto have reached a state of any serious tension.At the present time Dzerzhinaky&apos;s party seems to have the upperhand in the Executive Committee, although a large number of itsmembers, including Kalinine, the President, favours Lenin.   If
Litvinoff were to return from Copenhagen without having anytangible results to show as the result of his mission it is possiblethat the majority of the Committee would rally round Lenin andadopt his policy to obtain peace.The main difference between the two parties is that Lenin&apos;s party(in December 1919 at any rate) was quite willing to make peacebased on the status quo, and to leave such parts of Eussia as are in thehands of j;he Whites outside the boundaries of the Soviet Eepublic.The Extremists, on the other hand, were opposed to making peacewith the; non-proletariat sections of the community, and refuse torecognise the White leaders. It is probable that the failures ofDenikin and Koltchak have considerably strengthened their hand.If peace both with foreign powers and also in Eussia could besecured, it is probable that the Chrezvychaika would disappear almostimmediately, but, if a state of civil war were to continue in Eussia, itwould undoubtedly remain in power.

A Letter from Bucharin to the American Communists.- The following translation from the Eussian of a letter ofinstructions from Moscow to the comrades in America, which wastaken from a captured Bolshevik courier two or three months ago,gives a clear picture of the methods the Bolsheviks intend to employin fomenting revolution in foreign countries: &quot; Eespected Comrades,&quot; Permit us to place before you the sum total of our advice andinstructions to you concerning the current work in America: &quot; 1. We assume that now, after the expulsion of a number ofsections from the American Socialist Party, the time has arrived forthe organisation of a Communist Party in the United States, whichparty will get into official touch with the Communists of the Inter-national. We assume also that, besides this Communist Party,another party would be formed of the Left element of the SocialistLeague (now excluded) of the American Socialist Party, thus splittingthe Socialist Labour Party, which, according to our experience, it isvery important to split, as its actions directly oppose many of ouraims. As regards the Industrial Workers of the World, its principleof non-political action disappears as the party comes to recognise thedictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet rule. Should the organisa-tion of the Communist Party be effected, it is logical that it shouldbe represented in Moscow.&quot;2. We assume that one of the most important aims at thepresent is the organisation of Communist &quot; nuclei&quot; among soldiersand sailors (military section), which will carry on energeticpropaganda in organising Soviets of soldiers and sailors, and preachingthe fanatical persecution of officers and generals.&quot; 3. (a.) Attempts at organising the Workers&apos; Soviets, which havealready been made, should on no account be allowed to degenerateinto philanthropic or social associations, of which, we fear, there isonly too much danger in America. For this reason we lay greatstress on the point that the Soviets, until they have seized control ofpower, must be militant fighting units aiming at the control of theState and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Not one inch is to beyielded from this position. Direction of strikes, direction of unem-ployment, and fomenting insurrections this is your work.&quot; (b.) It is necessary that the greatest precaution be taken toavoid the splitting up of the proletariat into national groups.Therefore your energies should be based on the development of amovement to establish Soviets of workers of various nationalities.The core of the revolution will still remain American.&quot; 4. The general programme will be as follows: &quot;(a.) Down with the Senate and Congress!  Long live theGovernment of Workers&apos; Soviets!&quot; (5.) Down with capitalists in factories!  Long live the manage-ment of factories by the workers !&quot;(c.) Down with speculators !  All organisation of food andother supplies to be in the hands of workers.&quot; Everywhere it is necessary sharply to emphasise the idea ofthe seizure of the whole of the machinery of economic administration
