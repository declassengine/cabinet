-saw---*%t-I&apos;v 1/      70[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1920.[173996]I CIRCULATE to my colleagues in the Cabinet a Memorandum on the necessityfor the immediate Ratification of the Peace Treaty with Austria.C. of K.--f- Foreign Office, February 12, 1920.Parliamentary counsel, on instructions from ttie Treasury, has drafted a Bill forcarrying into effect the Treaties of Peace with Austria and Bulgaria. The AustrianTreaty was signed at St. Germain on the 10th September, the Bulgarian Treaty atNeuilly on the 27th November. The Hungarian Treaty will, it is hoped, be signedshortly ; in which case immediate steps will be taken to lay it before Parliament andto bring it within the scope of the draft Bill. The Austrian Treaty has already beenlaid before Parliament, and the Bulgarian Treaty will be laid during the next few days.The measures which require legislation by Parliament in order to bring them intoeffect in the United Kingdom are of small importance in comparison with the mainpart of the treaties, which cannot be put into operation until after ratification. Thesemeasures are, indeed, very similar to those which Parliament has already sanctionedfor the carrying out of the treaty with Germany.On the other hand, ratification is for many political reasons urgently required, andParliament has been informed in the King&apos;s Speech that it is intended to ratify thetreaties with Austria and Bulgaria as soon as possible, and to push on the negotiationswith Hungary and Turkey. Indeed, the most urgent need of South-Eastern Europeto-day is peace, which is at the same time the greatest interest of the British Empire inthose countries.The draft Bill has been communicated by the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office,the Treasury,, the Home Office, the India Office, and the Board of Trade. Theconcurrence of these Departments has been asked in the immediate ratification of the&apos; treaty with Austria. The Board of Trade view with some alarm the proposal thatratification should be proceeded with at once, on the ground that legislation is requiredin order to carry out the obligations of the treaty, and that the passage of suchlegislation cannot be assured so long as the provisions of the treaty have not beendiscussed in Parliament. On the other hand, nearly all the Dominions have expressedtheir consent in the ratification of the treaty with Austria by the King.   ,It is proposed by the Foreign Office that, owing to the present conditions inAustria and in Simth-Eastern Europe generally, ratification by the British tCmpireshould be deposited as soon as all the Dominion Governments have expressed theirconsent, without awaiting debate in the Imperial or Dominion Parliaments. Theprerogative of the Grown in this matter is undoubted, and the need for immediateratification, imperative-.
