The training of disabled men (other than those needingcontinual medical treatment) in agricultural and horticultural pursuits,formerly a function of the Ministry of Pensions, is now conducted by theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries on behalf of the Ministry ofLabour, to whom the general responsibility of training the disabledwas transferred.   As my Department is only a technical agency for thiswork, I submit for consideration the following serious difficulty whichnow faces the Government.Most of the disabled men under training consider themselvesentitled to claim a cottage holding on their discharge from thetraining centres managed by my Department.   They believe, rightly orwrongly, that they have been guaranteed such a holding by theGovernment.   Whether any statements have been made by the Ministriesof  fusions or Labour on which such a belief could reasonably be foundedI do not know, but the fact remains that the belief is widespread.Sharp complaints are being made by the Associations which representthe ex-soldiers&apos; interests on behalf of the few men who have completed *their training and are without holdings.   When the few have become       uthousands, the situation will be difficult to handle.   It is uselessto say to such men that they must seek employment as wage-earners:they start with a severe handicap and the probability of theiremployment by farmers or market gardeners is practically nil.   Thereis no avenue of employment as gardeners in private gardens, wherestaffs are being greatly reduced:   there is already unemploymentamongst skilled and able-bodied gardeners.   Even a full year18training in agricultural operations would not fit them to enter theranks of the agricultural labourers.   The Trade Unions would objectto their entry at less than the standard rates of wage, and thefarmers would not be prepared to pay-such wages to men with adistinct disability.   It is clear that such men, if they are to followagriculture, must be provided with a sheltered existence on a somewhatuneconomic basis.Under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act the County^Councils let holdings only to applicants who prove themselves onexamination to be suitable, and as disabled men cannot be expected tomake an economic success of an ordinary holding the Councils naturallyregard them as unsuitable and generally disclaim the duty of providingthem with holdings, when they have large numbers of fully skilled andable-bodied applicants who will in any case have to wait for from six(jj.months to two years before being satisfied.The only plan which appears to be feasible is to place themupon the Ministry&apos;s settlements and provide them with cottageholdings, i.e. an acre or a little more and a cottage, instead of withthe five to fifty acre hoBiing required by the ordinary man who has tomake his whole living out of his land.   It will be possible for a man,who can only give part time or partial work owing to his disability,to make a reasonable addition to his living by small cultivation offruit and vegetables and by the keeping of poultry and other smallstock.   Such provision for disabled men would have the additionalgreat advantage of making them their own masters as regards thedisposition of their time.   Many of them will not be able to dc a fullday&apos;s work, or may require to absent themselves on occasion,.and whileCAB TOT.LAND SETXMGOjT FOR DISABLED MSN.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.
iyihile this Wfruld be extremely difficult to adjust with any masterEwieh they are working for wages it would be possible when the man isI his own master and can probably get some help from hie wife and family.QI come now to the dimensions of the problem.The Ministry of labour provisionally estimate that myDepartment will be called upon to train from ^,000 to 5,000 men,exclusive of officers, concerning the number of whom no estimate isavailable.   Even if we assume that only 1,000 of the men who will demandholdings are found on examination to be suitable for the propercultivation of a. cottage holding, heavy expenditure will be involved.Assuming that the holdings will be of from i to 3 acres,according to the fertility of the land and the capacity of the individualto work it,, the average cost of the land, lay-out, roads, water-supply ,etc. may be taken at  200, making a total capital outlay of  1,100 perholding.   For 1,000 men this means a capital expenditure of  1,100,000*This involves an annual charge, at 5-^, of  60,500, to which must beadded 15$ for repairs, cost of administration and supervision, makingan annual charge of, say,  70,000.   From this may be deducted  20,000,being the rents of  20 per holding (with cottage] on the 1,000 holdings.The net annual charge involved by a scheme of the kind willtherefore be in the order of  50,000.   It will be noted that more thanthree-quarters of the cost is for the cottages alone and the problemis mainly one of housing and if met will, by so much, reduce thegeneral expenditure on rural housing.   There would be, however, afurther outlay, viz:   a grant to such men as were without means of a sumfor working capital to start them in business.It is estimated that on a cottage holding devoted tohorticulture and poultry keeping, a maximum average sum of  100 willbe necessary.   Under the credit scheme for small holders already inoperation under Treasury sanction, they can secure the loan of a poundfor every pound they provide themselves up to a total of  500.   If,therefore, a disabled man were given a free grant of  50 he could borrowa like amount,   inquiries have been made as to whether such a grantwould be forthcoming from the King*s Fund, the National Relief Fund,Lord Byng&apos;s Fund, or other similar sources, but without success.   Itwould be necessary therefore for the Treasury to be prepared to provideup to  50,000 (i.e. 1,000 x  50), though my Department would not issuesuch a grant, if sanctioned, unless satisfied that the disabled menasking for it could not be set up in business without it.   Men who mayexpect to keep pigs as well as poultry would have to find the necessarycapital themselves.If this proposal is rejected I can no longer accept theresponsibility of giving to disabled men a vocational training atconsiderable cost to the State, with the certainty that the completionof the training course will simply throw on to the agricultural labourmarket embittered men who will not be employed and who cannot befurnished with a cottage holding on which to earn enough money (takinginto account their pensions) to bring them a decent livelihood.   Trainingwithout subsequent settlement means waste of money now and serioussocial trouble i,n the future.   If, on the other hand, as I recommend, it44 decided to provide the cottage holdings as above I shall clearlynotify all men under training that -(a) only tjiose of them will be&apos;, provided for who have taken thefullest advantage of their training and can satisfy myDepartment (through the County Agricultural Committees) thatthey c,an properly cultivate and manage a cottage holding;(b) holdings cannot be ready at the conclusion of their trainingbut will be provided so soon only as the cottages can bebuilt,, and that meanwhile they must obtain such temporaryemployment as may be open to them.
(lj   That the Cabinet approve the provision by the Treasury ofa capital sura of  1,100,000 (with a resulting annual loss of  50,000)for cottage     -holdings for suitable disabled ex-service men who haveundergone Government training in agriculture.(2)   That the sum be placed at the disposal of the Ministry ofAgriculture for the provision of the cottage holdings on the Ministry&apos;sland settlement estates, and that it be in addition to the sums alreadyprovided or to be provided for the settlement of able-bodied men.L of F.February 13th, 1920.
