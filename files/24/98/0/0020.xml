Though a strikefor nationalisation is still spoken of, partly in order tointimidate the Government, it is quite clear that the greatcampaign for nationalisation, for which ten million leafletswere printed by the Co-operative Society, has been a failure.Many miners would come out if called upon, but they are notanxious for a strike.   Conversations with leading men in theSouth Wales coalfields seem to show that the men are not evenprepared to strike for nationalisation.   The question isscarcely discussed at all.   The other Unions are apathetic.The settlement of the Moulders1 strike has oleared theair.   The Clyde has never been so quiet for many weeks.   Theoutput is increasing and there is a general air of settlingdown to work.   One very encouraging symptom is the falling offin the membership of the extremist Societies.   The extremeleaders are discouraged and several have said that thepsychological moment for a revolution has/passed and that, fromtheir point of view, this country is hopeless.On the other hand, though the revolutionary societies areshort of funds there is an increase in the undergroundactivities of the Internationalists.   Money is being broughtinto the country and there is a ya-et-vlent of Englishrevolutionaries to and from the Continent.   Moreover, there is astrong move for extending revolutionary teaching by open airclasses connected with the Labour Colleges.   In this respect, therecent bad weather has been a good friend to law and order.The/
- z -The Albert Hall was.packed last night with Sinn Peinerand there was an overflow meeting outside.   There wasconsiderable interruption and about a doaen men wereejected with great violence; other diBsentierfts, to thenumber of about 150, left the Hall.   The speeches weresuspended during the disturbances.   About half the audiencewas composed of women, for the most part young.   Theviolence of the Stewards appears to have antagonized partof the audience.
HATIOMLISATIOH OF THE) MINESLittle has transpired to show the feeling of the mensince the miners&apos; Interview with the Prime Minister.   Theleaders appear to he trying to intimidate the Government,if one may judge, from the speech of Mr. Hodges at B&amp;tterseaon February Oth:t&quot;Some of the more revolutionary spirits maysay we are not going fast enough, but we areprobably going much faster than most of therevolutionary men, because we have ceased to talkrevolution and are prepared to act it.   We aregoing forward with a determination that will notbrook defeat, but will win through regardless ofthe cost.&quot;In a recent pamphlet (&quot;Workers1 Control in the CoalMining Industry&quot;) he wrote that the real factor in thedecline of production-Is the growing consciousness that allis not well in the industry; that the men have been bereftof anything like a voice in /ts direction.   &quot;Output,&quot; hesaid, &quot;Will never reaohvthe pre-war level until avenuesare provided for their desire for effective control.&quot;My correspondent, who has made a very carefulinvestigation in Lanarkshire, Lancashire and South Wales,sends me the following report:H0n Nationalisation the men are still apatheticand they talk less about it, but if called out theywill undoubtedly strike.   I have absolutely failedto find om delegate who expects that a generalstrike will be called to enforce nationalisation,and there is no doubt at all that if the ballot wastaken secretly under independent supervision onthe wages sheets list Of workers from each pit,to prevent duplication, the strike would be turneddown.   There seems to be one important pointweighing with the more responsible men and thatis - a strike by miners or anyone sIbo on a large, scale which would inconvenience the public wouldmean certain failure cf labour men getting in atthe next general election in numbers sufficient toform a labour government, and this feeling isundoubtedly being well rubbed in and beginning tohave some effect.&quot;There/
There are generally warning symptoms when troublo \\to &quot;be ezcpected and at present nono of these have beenobserved either in Scotland or in Yorkshire.It is right, -however, to ,say that.another correspondreports from Lancashire as follows:&quot;She position is. regarded.as very serious by1 the Ooliiers who talk of nothing else... They aresolid in -their support of Nationalisation of theMines&apos;&apos;and as we have pointed out before, wouldstrike en masse if ordered to-do so&quot;by theirExecutive.&quot;Their;leaders claim they&apos; have the wholeTrade Union movement behind -theirt, &apos;bui? I &amp;onTt belie-?!it, and do.not. think they believe it &quot;either.&quot;As far as tho rank and- file of &quot;the cottonoperatives. are: concerned, I&apos;am certain, they touIcLnot strike at the present time -&quot;to heib the Minorsto enforce Nationalisation of the Mines.   Theyhave too much at stake themselves.&quot;The. opinion of the miners - seems to be,.  howovor, that the crisis is not yet.&quot;After the Miners1 meeting at Wigan.onFebruary 4th.a group;of -ooliiers was discussingthe meeting in the Market Place,, and one who .appeared to be in the know said he had it on the-&apos;   - authority of Mr. Harry Twist that the ExecutiveCommittee of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners1federation was&apos; by no means pleased with the ... .results of their campaign and that apart from&apos; the&quot;Miners themselves,- they thought the country wasmore against nationalisation&apos;than for it.&quot;Sven in.-Wigan,&apos;a mining district in thecentre of the Lancashire ooal field, .only s,bout 600persons were present at a nationalisation meetingon February 4th,.in a Hall which seats 2,000- ^persons.        ;   :  -&apos; -   -   -      ; ; i.  .&apos;. &quot;There- is considerable opinion amongst the. - Miners that- the best, policy -fort their Federation *-&apos;-     &apos; to pursue would be to wait until the end&apos; of March,when the Cotton Operatives-make their demand forincreased wages, meanwhile to try to come,to somearrangement whereby they could take joint actionfor the dual purpose- of enforcing, if necessary,the Operatives&apos; demands for increased&quot;wages andtheir own  pr the Nationalisation of the Mines,&quot;Until the return from Belgium of Messrs. SmilHe andHodges there can be no developments by the Miners1 Executiveeither in examining their accounts or arranging for theadjourned meeting with the Prime Minister, THE/
f73THE&quot;HANDS OFF RUSSIA&quot; MOVEMENTThe &quot;monster&quot; demonstration arranged by the Workers&apos;.  Social Federation for Trafalgar Square on February 7th wasan indication of the public indifference to the wholequestion.   At no time did the audience exceed 1,000 people,and, of these, half at least were passers by, whosoremarks on the speakers were indifferent or antagonistic.* The speeches themselves were of the stereotyped, violentsort, which have lost their point by endleBD reiteration;most frequenters of meetings must know them by heart.Some of the speakers made use of an extraot from the Berlin&quot;Rote Fahne&quot;, reprinted in the &quot;Workers&quot; Dreadnought&quot;, tothe effect that the defeat of Yudenitch was due to theaction of British workmen who had removed the essentialparts of guns before shipping them.The effeot of the visit of Mr. Lansbury to Russia mayinfuse new life into the movement, for Mr. Lansbury istrusted by a very large section of labour who believe himto be honest, even if his Judgment is sometimes at fault.His first wireless message, eulogising Bolshevik rule andpleading for peace, appeared in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; ofFebruary 10th.   He does,&apos; however, admit the existence of .^industrial conscription, and he announces that Tchitcherintold him that the Russian Co-operative Societies had appointedLitvincff as their agent.   He makes it clear&apos; that theSoviet Government has taken over the Co-operatives lockstook and barrel; that they are in fact merely distributingagencies for the Government, and that every Bolshevik citizenis de facto a member of the Co-operative Society - a fact thathas already been made clear by the speeoh put into the mouthI \ I If mmB     If If II i llll l^lf^ll; flfj, of/
*-4 Wof Lenin by the Russian Wireless,   It was too good an ^opportunity for the Soviet Government to neglect, and it isnow clear that any delegates that may be sent over by the Co-operators will be agents of the Bolshevik Oligarchy.&apos;It is interesting to compare the average expenditurein 1919 of a British Co-operator with his Society with thatof a Russian Co-operator.   In Great Britain it was  40 and inRussia only 83 roubles.GLASGOW DISTRICTApart from the Irish element Glasgow is in a morehealthy condition than it was three months ago.   The output ofskilled workers has increased.   Comparing the figures fromthe cost cards in Jenuary, 1920 and November, 1919, we find-the following approximate increase in output:Rivettersand holders up ... 14$ -Drillers..................18$Fitters ....................   IfMachine men (various) .....   9$Otoners...................   9$Tinsmiths...............8$The settlement of the meuldersT strike has been salutary,and, in the opinion of engineering managers, conditions arenow beginning to resemble those of pre-War times.   There isless grumbling among the men and if better transport wereavailable the outlook would be good.   Some credit must begiven in this respect to the bad weather which hampers out-door oratory.  My correspondents think that printed matter isfar less harmful than out-door speeches, and conversely thatleaflets and posters are less effective for propagandapurposes than speeches.The membership cf revolutionary organisations isdecreasing in Glasgow, and, ;in consequence, funds are runninglow.   358 members have loft the Soviet bodies in two monthsand the organisation is degenerating into a skeleton withoutany rank and file,&apos;     &quot;&apos;  &quot; &apos; &apos; -    The/
The Clyde Workers1 Defence Committee has. neither moneynor friends.   Three of its collectors are &quot;being proceededagainst for misappropriation of the funds and an action ispending to recover about  2,000.   The membership is rapidlydecreasing,,   The Socialist Labour Party is also losingmembers and money.My correspondent also reports that the IndependentLabour Party and the British Socialist Party are talking-less wildly, perhaps with an eye to their chancep at thenext Elections.AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THE SHOP STEWARD UOVMBITTThere has lately been an attempt to revive the oldtactics of the Shop Stewards, but tho report of the CentralCommittee states that owing to &quot;apathy&quot; two sub-Committeeshave dropped out and two others will probably collapse.Attempts in the Midlands and in Sheffield to form suchCommittees have failed and at Liverpool the Union &quot;black-listed&quot; a fitter who came down from the Clyde to start aCommittee,   The Unions on the Clyde have taken similaraction and the lav/less element among the Irish is too busy.with its own schemes to take any interest in Shop Stewardquestions.   The movement, therefore, will probably collapse.REVOLUTIONARY TEACHINGIt was lately remarked by Mr. Bernard Shaw that norevolutionary movement would succeed until the present basisof education was swept away and pacifism and proletarianteaching substituted for militarism said patriotism.   TheWorkers1 Educational Association has formed a specialCommittee to work up tutorial classes, study circles, week-end/
end schools and correspondence classes.   This experiment isat present confined to the Steel Trades1 Federation, which 1a membership of l 0,00O.   The Committee is to keep in closetouch with the so-called Labour Colleges of the National Uniof Railwaymen and the Miners&apos; Federation.   One may thereforet        Jguess what kind of economic teaohing they will give.The inculcation of class hatred is still an importantfeature of the Trade Union Monthly journals.   Far example,the Locomotive Journal (the official organ of the .Associated Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen)devotes several pages to matter q*uite unconnected with theUnion, and the Editorial Notes of Mr. Bromley cover subjectranging fr^m profiteering to the &quot;Willy-Nicky&quot; correKpondeEJiin the &quot;Morning Post&quot;.There is still a movement for using the. film for Labonpropaganda, and at Derby W. Paul gave a lantern lecture on&quot;Triumph and Martyrdom of Russian Labour&quot;, which was sosuccessful that the branch decided to adopt this class of Jlecture, since it impressed the workers much more stronglythan the ordinary type of address.   This suggests that thedaylight film apparatus, mounted on a car; such as was usedGermany during the War, might bo very useful in the countrjdistricts in England.The International Working Class Students&apos; Union aimsfounding travelling scholarships and an International Sooli]Library.mTHE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT AND THE TRADE UNIONSThe opposition of co-operators to the use of their i\for Labour purposes, which has already been reported in ,Scotlandm
Scotland and Lancashire, has now spread to Yorkshire.   At ameeting in Leeds last week the Labour members were overwhelmedby their opponents and a suggested levy for political actionby the co-operators was vetoed.THE INDEPENDENT IeftBOUR PARTYFollowing the examples of the 1st and 8th Divisions(Scottish and Welsh), the 9th (North Western) Division hasnow passed a resolution by 69 to 67 votes . in favour ofaffiliation with the Third International.   The 4th Division(Midlands), on the other hand, passed an amendment &quot;that theNational Administrative Council be instituted to summon aspecial conference to discuss the question&quot;.At the half yearly Conference of the 9th DivisionalCouncil on January 31st,-Mr. R.C. Wallhead stated that thelast&quot;twelve months had been unique in the growth of theParty.   At the present moment it has a&apos; membership on thebooks of 50,000 and a branch roll membership of 70,000.No. 9 Division holds the premier record.   From March toNovember, 1919, the fees totalled  1,431. 2s. 5d., andfor the corresponding period, 1918,&apos; 1,217. 6s. Id., whilobranches had Increased by almost 100.   In Divisions 4, 5 and6 (Eastern) the increase was 18 per cent.   In Division 8,21 per cent.   Divisions 2 and 3 (North Eastern and Yorkshire)28 per cent, and in Division 9, 38 per cent, ^which was thebest increase for a division in the $$rty.THE FINANCE OF THE BRITISH SOCIALIST PARTYAccording to the statement of accounts for the year 1919the British Socialist Party has spent more than it has reoeivedand &quot;The Call&quot; has been published at a loss of  458.   Moreover,the/
the funds subscribed for Parliamentary Elections appear tohave been spent for other purposes.   This seems scarcely themoment for increasing the salary of the paid officials, yetAlbert Inkpin, the Secretary, who received  3 a week beforethe war and is now drawing  5. 2s. 6d., is demanding 8. 11s. Od. on the ground that the purchasing value of thepound is only 7s. Od. of its pre-war value.   The Cpmmitteehas consented to an increase to  7 a week, with proportionateincreases to the other employees, so that unless money isreceived from abroad the Party cannot carry on.   They arecounting upon receiving a considerable accession of fundsfrom Holland during the coming week.FEELING AMONG EX-SERVICE MSB   &apos;The deputation to the Prime Minister came awaydisappointed and a member of the Executive stated atNewcastle on February 7th that although the Federation wasa uon-party organisation the members would be advised tovote against the Government at all bye-elections.Sunday, March 5th, is to be a day of demonstration infavour of back pay for ex-Service men.   All Unions andSocieties which are sympathetic are to be invited toco-operate, but it is to be made clear that individuals whojoin in the demonstrations are to have no share in thecontrol of the Federation.Special stress is to be, laid on the release of menin the &quot;2&quot; Reserve, and if any are re-called to the Coloursinformation is to be sent to Headquarters immediately.EX-LIEUTENANT NICHOLSONIt is reported that Nicholson has circulated 300 copi8Jof/      I
-   of the following letter:&quot;Your name has boen given me as one who will helpin disposing of our Draw Tickets for the LincolnHaJ.icL1.oap far the fund.3 of our revolutionary propaganda,,Please do your best to retail them in your district.Commission 30$ to soilers*   Book stamps to be returned17.3*20.&quot;., .My correspondent states that the money,is to be used forthe formation of a committee to draw up plans for a &quot;Bed Armywhich would act in the event of.a general strike.   It isintended to obtain arms for a shooting c3.ub under the guiseof a patriotic &quot;learn to shoot&quot; movement,Nioholsonj who is a heavy drinker, is stated to have boo:imprisoned in the United States for felony.&apos;   He broke awayfrom the National Union of Bx-Service Men a3 he.did notconsider that body sufficiently revolutionary.TOM DING-L2Ttfor some time Dingley, the Shop Steward. has beenemployed at the Plough Motor Repair DepBt and he is nowrunning a series of ,dinner-hour lectures there.   It i3reported that he is &quot;coaching the boya who are anxious togive expression to Socialist or advanced ideas.&quot; &quot;BingleyIn an active revolutionary and a friend of ex-LieutenantNicholson.SINN ffSIN W G32AT BRITAINThe demonstration in the -Albert Hall on February 11thwas packed.   The greater part of the audience was composedof women and young girls; no labour men were present, norwas there any largo body of aliens0   A good many personsinterrupted, but were ejected with considerable violence,and the free fights that ensued caused interruptions ofseveral minutes, in the speeohecuThe/
The most dangerous centre of Sinn Fein activity inthis country is Glasgow, where the Irish have a certainamount of industrial power.   There and in Liverpool it i&amp;lpossible that a repercussion would occur, if serious troilarose in Ireland.   It is doubtful, however, if this wouldgo further than indiscriminate rioting, such as occurredLiverpool during the police strike.   At present there is ievidence of an early offensive movement, but my corresponireports that the Irish -Labour Party, which is a dominatinginfluence in Glasgow, needs careful watching.   Dre?/, theleader of this party, is attempting to discredit SeanMcLaughlin, about whom he has   caused enquiries to be made)in Dublin.   The leaders of Sinn Fein in that city state\that they do not recognise McLaughlin, who assumed thetitle of Sinn Fein commander without authority afterConnolly was wounded.   In consequence of Drew&apos;s action,McLaughlin, whose violent speeches are notorious, is tryingto ingratiate himself with the Industrial Workers of theWorld..    ...Mr. Charles Diamond, of the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; made asingularly mild speech at Paisley on February 8th.The principal branches in connection with the IrishSelf-Determination League in South Wales are at Cardiff(250 members), Newport (280), Maesteg (300), Dowlais (100)and Merthyr (80).   Efforts are being made to organise newbranches and to strengthen the ones already in existence. IThe Cardiff Branch of the Irish Self-DeterminationLeague and the Cardiff Branch of the Ancient Order ofHibernians are combining with a view to organising a uniteddemonstration of all Irishmen in Cardiff and surroundingdistricts/
districts on St, Patrick&apos;s Day.   There is, however,dissension &quot;between the two bodies, as the Sinn Feinersare determined to wear their republican colours anddisplay their banners,while the Ancient Order ofHibernians object to this decision, stating thatalthough they, strongly appeal against the downtroddencondition of Ireland they nevertheless refuee publiclyto support the policy of the Self-Determination League.IRELANDRegarding the recent arrest of the Sinn Feinleaders, it is now reported that 88 per cent of theintended arrests v/ere effected.I have direct information that the arrests havebeen a very severe blow to the extremists.   All theleaders have left Dublin and are not expected back untilMarch.   Their agents in London cannot understand why theydid not stand their ground.   They say that it isimpossible for them to send in arms or do any Sinn Feinwork under such circumstances.There have been a very large number of minor out-rages, chiefly taking the form of raids for arras onprivate houses.   Early on Sunday morning armed raidersat Arklow carried off half a ton of gelignite, part of acargo belonging to Messrs. Kyrioch&apos;s works.   Seven motorcars, a quantity of petrol and the telephone installationwere taken away by raiders from the garage of the Armyand Navy Canteen Board recently.Armed rebels attacked the Royal Irish ConstabularyBarracks/
&apos;    IfBarracks at Ardmere, County Waterford.   The attack lastedfor over an hour, none of the Royal Irish Constabularywere injured, but civilians state that they saw two ofthe rebels fall during the firing.   Telegraph andtelephone wires were cut and roads were barricaded inthe surrounding district.The strike of the Irish Drivers&apos; and AutomobileMechanics Union, which began on December 1st, ended onMonday, February 9th.   The opposition to it was not agenuine industrial opposition but was engineered andmaintained by politicians for political and other ends.r.;r :&apos;. &apos; Q\
