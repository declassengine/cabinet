Some sniping also reported on lines of communication.(8) Following are extractions from (corrupt group) by General Climo, dated11th February:-&quot; There is now practically no lashkar opposed to us, and advances made duringweek have been unopposed. The heart has gene out of tribesmen to an even greater.extent than was anticipated, and the dispersal of large lashkar without showing anyfight bears eloquent testimony to this fact. I am certain the heavy losses claimed, tohave been inflicted on tribesmen have not been over estimated. The tribesmen willnot necessarily accede to our terms ; it is always possible that they will refuse dealingswith us and will allow their villages to be destroyed rather than submit, well knowingwe will not remain in their country for long. Their Maliks seem to have little poweror influence over individuals, and it is difficult to see why any individual off our lineof operations should give up his hard-won rifle in order to save from destruction somevillage in which he is not personally interested.&quot;Paras. (1), (2), (3) and (8) not communicated to Press.
