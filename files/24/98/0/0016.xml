Mr. Longhurst.Admiralty Memorandum to the Cabinet.In accordance with the decisions of the Cabinet Conference held on 9th December 1919, lists of stockcommodities and standardised articles have been forwarded to the Ministry of Munitions and copies areattached.List (1) comprises stores common to the fighting services in regard to which no difficulty is apprehendedin the matter of provision and inspection by a central organisation.List (2) comprises common stores in regard to which difficulties in regard to central inspection willinevitably arise.2. The Admiralty fully appreciate the Cabinet view that the aim should be to set up an efficient andeconomical purchase organisation for these standardised stores, but are of opinion that this object will not beachieved by the Cabinet proposal to set up an additional Department for the purpose.3. While giving their reasons for this opinion they now suggest what they regard as a simpler andsounder organisation which is based on making use of the highly experienced machinery already existing inthe fighting departments.4. It has now been conceded that the operations of a Central Buying Department must be confined towhat may be called commercial or standardised stores, and that the fighting departments must be left topurchase their own technical stores.5. The adoption of this limited scheme would be less objectionable than the original one, as ic wouldnot diminish to the same extent the responsibility of the War Departments for the efficiency of the respectivefighting forces. It would, however, involve difficulty and overlapping without conferring any advantagethat cannot be gained by simpler and less expensive means, and it is therefore not recommended foradoption.6. It is most difficult in practice to decide where the so-called &quot; Common &quot; articles leave off and the&quot; Technical &quot; stores begin. Although some stores could easily be allocated to one or the other list, a largenumber would be doubtful or would alter their character from time to time. The preparation and revisionof the lists of &quot; Common&quot; articles will inevitably give opportunities for differences of opinion and delay. Inthis connection it must be recognised that the knowledge possessed by the War Departments of oneanother&apos;s requirements is more intimate and can more safely be relied upon than the knowledge likely to bepossessed by a Department built up on the foundation of the Office of Works and the Stationery Office.Consequently, many articles which could be looked upon as &quot; Common &quot; if it were a question of one WarDepartment buying on behalf of another, must be regarded as &quot; Technical&quot; for the purposes of the presentproposition.7. Further, in most instances, the articles common to a particular industry embrace both &quot; Common &quot;and &quot; Technical&quot; stores. The relegation of the &quot;Common&quot; stores to the Office of Works will not, there-fore, obviate the necessity of the War Departments continuing to deal with the same industry for moretechnical supplies. Consequently the presumed object that only one Department should deal with aparticular industry will not be attained.8. Although the Cabinet at the Conference held on the 9th December last did not contemplate vestingthe Central Purchasing Department with power to maintain stocks of the commodities and articles purchasedby them, it is felt that a few observations upon this point are nevertheless called for. The Admiralty wishto place on record their opinion that unless they can have absolute control of the stocks of stores requiredby them for Naval purposes, it is not possible to be responsible for maintaining the efficiency of the Fleet.It is obvious that in peace, as in war, security of British trade must be ensured in all seas. This entails adisposition of stocks at convenient places at Home and Abroad for maintaining war ships. Unless, there-fore, the Admiralty has complete control of the articles required for this purpose, there is no guarantee thatthe ships can be maintained.In these circumstances the Admiralty is strongly of opinion that auy system under which bulk storageis maintained by another Department can only lead to inconvenience and possibly disaster in one or otherof the fighting services dependent upon such bulk storage.9. The Admiralty adhere to the views already expressed in their Memorandum of 2nd May 1919, andit is their considered opinion that it would be found to be impossible to create such a central organisation asis proposed without sacrificing the essential principle of undivided responsibility. They are quite in accordwith the Cabinet desire to promote a more efficient method of organising the means which exist for buyingthe common stores of the Service Departments in peace and war.In this connection it is interesting to record that the suggestion of having one. general purchaser forall the Departments of State was considered and rejected by a Select Committee of the House of Commonson Public Departments in 1873. See the Report of the Select Committoo on Public Departments(Purchases, &amp;c, 1873-74), paragraphs 115 and 116.10. The considerations which commended themselves to that Committee have equal weight to-day,and the fact that little purchasing will be necessary for some years renders unnecessary any hasty settingup of new machinery.Alternative Proposal for carrying out the Cabinet Aim.11. The Board of Admiralty consider that the desired object? can be far more satisfactorily attained byincreased co-operation and co-ordination between the Contract Departments of the fighting services, and thatthis could best be ensured by the formation of a Central Co-ordinating Committee consisting of tho heads ofo (33)AS79G3-14  Pk 3189 86  2/20  E&amp;S
the respective Contract Departments which should meet frequently. An independent Chairman is desirahlewho would make certain that the requisite co-ordination was achieved and continued.12. This simple expedient has heen suggested by the success which has attended the frequent meetingswhich have taken place during the war, between the heads of the contract branches of the variousDepartments, both informally and later on as a recognised Committee under the chairmanship of Lo rdColwyn.13. Such a Committee can effectively obviate any competition and overlapping. It can arrange for anyarticle required by more than one fighting service department being, in suitable cases, purchased by onedepartment on behalf of all. Further, it would co-ordinate methods of purchase and contract policy, arrangefor standardisation of patterns wherever possible, and take a comprehensive view of all available marketsand sources of supply.14. It would meet admirably the needs&apos; of an ordinary war, and in a war of the first magnitude wouldlend itself to expansion to any extent required.15. The Admiralty therefore submit that the whole subject should be reconsidered by the Cabinet inthe light of the foregoing remarks, pointing out that their proposals could be given effect to immediatelywith the minimum of expenditure and little disturbance of existing machinery, and that they will lead, ashas been indicated, to economy and efficiency.(Intlld.)
