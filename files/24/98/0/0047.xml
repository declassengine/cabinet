This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.3THE CABINET.NOTE ON  THE QUESTION OF ENZELI AND THEDEFENCE OF PERSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to my colleagues a note by the General Staff on the question of Enzeliand the defence of Persia, together with a telegram which it is proposed bo send to theGeneral Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.13th February, 1920.Memorandum by the General Staff.1. On 26th November, 1919, and again on 16th December, 1919 (0162/347), we-asked the Foreign Office for a definition of our commitments with regard to Britishmilitary obligations in defence of Persia. This matter is now brought to a head by thequestion of Enzeli which calls urgently for decision.2. The military situation in South&apos; Russia and in Transcaspia renders it probablethat the naval command of the Caspian will in a short time pass to the Bolsheviks.The possibility has therefore to be faced of Bolshevik aggression at any of the Persianports on the southern littoral, and it is considered highly probable that an attemptmay be made to use Enzeli as a bise from which to initiate active propaganda inPersia, even if serious military operations by the Boishevik forces are not to beexpected.3. Enzeli is at present occupied by three companies of Indian infantry and onesection of a machine-gun company, forming part of the mixed brigade which is being-maintained in North Persia, pending the organization of the Persian Army andGendarmerie. From the military point of view, the role of this brigade, including theEnzeli detachment, is that of an outpost, which, if attacked in force, will fall back tothe main line of resistance, which must be within reach of our railhead, that is to say,at least as far back as Hamadan.If His Majesty&apos;s Government has no intention of assisting Persia to defend herterritory by the use of British troops, the logical course is for the North PersianBrigade to be withdrawn forthwith in order to escape the loss of prestige involved in aretirement when in contact with the enemy.4. On the other hand there can be no question but that the withdrawal of thisforce from North Persia at the present juncture would exercise a deplorable effect onthe political situation generally. It would leave Teheran a prey to the Bolshevik forcesshould the Soviet Government decide actually to invade Persia, and in any case itwould shake the stability of the Persian Government and expose them to all the anti-British propaganda that would most certainly be instituted.It would further render very difficult the task of the British Military Missionwhich is now just starting to organize the Persian forces, and would also leave thecountry at the mercy of Starosselski&apos;s force of Persian Cossacks.5. In view of the delicate and difficult situation which exists at presentthroughout the Middle East, any withdrawal of British troops at this moment is to bedeprecated, as such a sign of weakness might well start a conflagration which, wouldhave the most iar-reaching consequences. It is considered that the detachment now atEnzeli with the aid of such reinforcements as are available in North Persia and someadditional artillery would, in all probability, prove a sufficient deterrent to theBolshevik naval forces to prevent them attempting a serious landing. Should this-expectation prove not to be justified, there is no reason to suppose that the detachmentcan not makt; good its retreat satisfactorily.(B20/103)   100  2/20   H&amp;S  7953wo
6. On the whole, therefore, it is considered that in keeping our detachment atEnzeli and showing a bold front to any Bolshevik ships which attempt to. approach theport; we should not be running a greater risk than is justified by the advantages to begained, and Authority is requested for the despatch of the attached telegram to theGeneral Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia.11th February, 1920.From War Office to General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia.\M.O. 2.)1. In continuation of No. 83483, M.O. 2, January, 1920. Military situation inSouth Russia renders it probable that naval command of the Caspian may shortly passto the Bolsheviks, in which case you must be prepared for Bolshevik aggression againstPersia from the Caspian, and for an attempt by them to make use of Enzeli as a basefor active propaganda and possibly for serious operations.2. From above-quoted telegram you will see that the role of Norperforce, from amilitary point of view, is that of an outpost which, if attacked in force, will fall back tothe main line of resistance which must be within reach of railhead.3. It is considered that the detachment now at Enzeli with the aid of suchreinforcements as are available in North Persia and some additional artillery wouldprobably prove such a deterrent to the Bolshevik naval forces as would prevent theirattempting a serious landing.. Even if this did not prove to be the case it would seemthat the detachment would not have much difficulty in making good its retreat.4. You should, therefore, make arrangements with your force in North Persia tooffer a bold front to Bolsheviks should they threaten Enzeli and endeavour by bluffto prevent them seriously attacking that place. &apos; At the same time, if seriouslyattacked, there is no intention of holding on to Enzeli and your arrangements shouldbe made so that the withdrawal of your detachment from Enzeli is assured. This forcewhilst withdrawing will, of course, endeavour during its withdrawal to delay theadvance of the Bolsheviks by every means at its disposal. In this connection you will,no doubt, make full use of the advantages offered by the Menzil Pass for delaying aBolshevik advance.In order to assist you we hope to send you some 4-inch Q.F. guns shortly.Meanwhile, if possible, the despatch by you of a section of field artillery, and suchreinforcements as you consider necessary, to Enzeli should be considered.5. Reference your No. X 8192 of 10th February, your action vis-a-vis Denikin&apos;sfleet should it arrive at Enzeli, will be communicated separately.
