[4f&amp; DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY. AF 33 BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)CP. 691SECRETCABINETTHE SITUAliOM IN SOUTH GiSlviANYMEMORANDUM BY THE FRESIDENT OF THS BOARD OF EDUCATION.I think that my oellsagues may be interested to readthis acccuni of * recent visit to South Germany by Mr BoswSmith of the BoaiU Of Education.Board of Education,February 20th 1020You asked me tc put down en paper a^me of my impreauionstf the conditions of life and the state of public opinion inthese parts of Germany through which I have been travellingduring the past three weeks,      I have endeavoured to sonfinemyself to statements cf fact and to the exposition of opinionswhich were actually expressed      me by those with whom Icame In contact.After considerable   difficulties with the tfsrman Consulat Davos, I at length secured permission to ente?r Germany onthe strength of an official summons from the Authorities ofFreiburg-inoffireisgau who required my presenco in connectionwith the probate of a will.      I was informed that no English-man was altowed to enter Germany from Switzerland unless hispresence waa specifically re:;uired by the German Authorities.I crossed the frontier between Schaffhauaen and Slngen andtraveled thence to Kb1 nigsfeld, a small town near Villfcigenain the Black Forest, where I spent a week.    After theaccounts which I had had of the nhortage of food and generaldiscomfort prevailing in Gsrmany, I was greatly surprised bythe apparent prosperity of the country districts.    The landwas fully cultivated; the forests wellkept and afforestationmaintained;   the houses ani farm buildings wdre In good repair;and food, even though unpalateaole, was sufficient in quantity,such things as eggs, butter, milk, and even meat (particularlygame, poultry, etc).feeing    obtainable at a price.    I found,however, that only a t?ery limited consumption of these thingswas permitted by law, most of them being obtained by illicitmeans at prices varying from &apos;100 to 200 or 30S per cent abovethe official maximum rates.      The rationing system allows eachperson a fined quantity per woek of tho principal qrticles offood, such as bread, butter, sugar, skimmed milk and meat, andps rmits the purchase of limited quantities of other foods atmaximum prices.   -  These prices are apparently too low to allowof reasonable profit and in consequence the non-rationed foodsare not to be seen in the chops or bought by ordinary means.As, however, the fixed rations are, as I subsequently found,quite insufficiont to keep body and soul togethor, it is essentialto supplement them somehow.    The result is that in the country,where there Is some-   small&apos; surplus of food, the practice of(intd.)H.A.L.F.
ij \jobtaining it bty ilicit means at excess prices (for which tho)   Germans have coined tho word &quot;Hamstern&quot;) has become practicallyuniversal, the only persons who do not resort to it being:producers, who are allowed to retain certain limited quantitiesof their produce for their own households, and the very poor whocannot pay the prices asked. -   The practice is almost equallyprevalent in the townsj though there the law can be more easily ,enforced and the absence of any appreciable surplus of foodmakes the secret purchases more difficult.     There is no doubt-that it goes against the grain for the Germans, who are bytradition law abiding citizens, tc disobey the law in this way.They all do it from necessity but they are fully alive to thedemoralising effect it is having on the nation and particularlyon children who are steadily losing not only respect for authoritybut even the sense of truthfulness.The Government are doing their best to put an end to thisillegal traffic in food and I was told that under a new law orregulation the penalty for supplying food in excess of the ration-ed&quot;quantities or at prices higher than those authorised, was infuture to be imprisonment without the option of a fine.     This isaimed particup-ll^v-against hotels and expensive restaurants whichprovide food in far greater quantity and variety than can beobtained by private individuals, especially in the towns.     Inprotest against this new ordnance, all the proprietors of hotels,sanatoria, pensions, etc. * in Baden have agreed tc close theirestablishments frcm the 16th February on the ground that it isimpossible for-their guests or patients to live on the rations.If the threatened strike takes place it will hit the townspeopleas well as patients and travellers very hard as it will cut offwhat is practically their only source of supply of additionalfood.In Freiburg-in-Breisgau the food supplied at my hotel was ofa very poor quality and entirely insufficient for my needs, butwith English money I was able to supplement it with such luxuriesas a cup of chocolate and a slice of cake at a restaurant for whichI had to pay 3 marks 50 - a price utterly impossible for a poorman, with a fixed income.     At breakfast I was given two slices ofblack bread with a questionable mixture which they called jam,a pot ox coffee, and a minute jug of very effectively separatedmilk which failed to.change the colour of the coffee.     There isno whole milk tc be had.     I was surprised at lunch and dinner tobe told by the waiter that I might take only &quot;half a herring, oneslice of ginger pudding, and one small spoonful of sauce.&quot;     Thebread ration, which last week was 300 grammes a day per head, isshortly to be reduced to 200 grammes, i.e., four small slices ofblack bread per day.     The. meat ration, which amounts at the mostto one ordinary helping ox meat a fortnight, would not at the bestbe of very much use for satisfying hunger or sustaining vitality.In point of fact, no meat at all was provided at ny hotel at1&apos;reiburg in the course of a six days1 visit   and I was toldthat it was largely a question of Inch whether even the fortnight-ly ration was forthcoming.The people at ICIinigsfold struck me as looking quite healthythough those whom I had known before the war were thinner and lessrobust.     On the other hand, the townspeople living in Freiburg,particularly tho children, were distinctly pallid and emaciated&apos;  -4-1
Of, C 4551and seemed highly strung.     There was an extraordinary air ofgloom - the adults, though talking with anxiety of the comingdiminution in the broad ration, the prospective cut ting; off of thesmall supplies of kagermileh through&quot;the surrender of the cattleto Belgium, and the increasing difficulty of obtaining theordinary articles of food, seomed almost to have lost interestin their future.     The;/ could see no prospect of improvement andfelt that there was nothing to look forward to.     In many oasesthis seemed to result in lavish expenditure and extravagance,though I gathered that the more prudent, realising the worth-lessness of the paper money, had already transferred theirsavings to Switzerland and invested them in francs in spite ofthe enormous loss on the exchange.I think that the thing which contributes most cf all to theutter listnessness and depression in Baden is the actual lossof the Saar Basin and the prospective loss of Silesia, which willmean that the only coal obtainable in Germany will be that of theV/estphalian coal field.   Although the quantity of coal in thatarea is probably sufficient to kee;:, German industry going, thedifficulty of distribution, which, has been greatly enhanced by-the surrender of locomotives and rolling stock, is thought to bealmost insuperable.     Certainly in Freiburg and the Black JForestcoal was practically unobtainable.     All lights in the towns haveto be extinguished at 10 p,m.;   the houses and trains are forthe most unheated;   rail and motor transport is completelysuspended on Sundays and on other days the train service is cutdown to a miintnmm with the result that all trains are crowded.For example, for the greater part of my journey from konigsfeldto Freiburg I had to sit on the step of a third class carriagealthough I had a first class ticket.It is the thought of the inevitable crippling of industrywhich will result from this shortage of coal in the more distantparts of Germany which fills the people with despair.     I wasagain and again assured that they felt the justice of. hating topay not only for the wilful destruction of property in Franceand Belgium, but also for the devastation directly resultingfrom the War.     What they felt was un,tet was that they should bedeprived of the means of payment.     &quot;V:&apos;e are ready tC&quot;&apos;T work, weare willing to        stint ourselves to the uttermost, we are ready,to pay, but you must not deprive us of the means of doing it,&quot;was the regular refrain.     It happened that last week while Iwas in the Sehwarzwald, the inspection of horses and cattle forsurrender to the Allies was talcing place.     I was surprised atthe absolute obedience which the people displayed in driving;their stock to the place of inspection, though I could not helpfeeling that this was only a syamptom of the prevailing apathy.The shortage of. milk is already very serious for the children andI was told by a dector of good position that ricketts and otherinfantile diseases, as well as tuberculosis, were still on theincrease, even in the country.     The surrender of the 25,000head of cattle to Belgium must, of course, make matters worse.
ad-The attitude of the people of Baden towards Englanddoes not seem to he different from what it was H  ere the,War.      I had many perfectly frank discussions with peasants,ex-3oldiers (some of whom had been prisoners in England)tradesmen, hotel keepers, doctorst professional ana businessmen and found that they had hardly any criticisms against us.They seemed to take it for granted that a&amp;.l that they regardedas most unfair in the- Peace Terms was the result of the French&quot;Rachsucht&quot;, the word in every manJs mouth.     There we*e,however, two things which struck them as inconsistent withtheir conception of English justice - the confiscation of theprivate property of Germans in England and the fact thatthe British signature was appended to the demand for the,surrender of war criminals.      They argued that the BritishGovernment must realise that the German State would not orcould not reimburse the private German citizens until theindemnity was pale in full and that it was contrary to allideas of justice and to the practice of International Lawto&apos; touch 9 rivate property in this way0The moot prominent topic of conversation, however,during my visit was the AuslieferungsfrageThe list ofaccused persons was published in the German papers inthe first week in February with the betters tlE&quot;, nP&quot; or&quot;B&quot;     (England, France or Belg&amp;tai) after each name, Indie-ating the country which had demanded the surrender of eachindividual.      They could not understand how England couldhave consented to the demand for such men as Bethman HollwdgHlndenburg. or Xmdendorff, and I got th  impression from thePress and from many conversations that Germany was solid toa man (with the possible exception of the Frankfurter Zeit-    -ung) against their surrender.      If the Allies wanted them,let them come and fetch them.      No German Government wouldever consent to hand them over, nor, i  they consented, wouldthey have the power- to do so in the face of public opinion.Would the English ever consent to hand over Jellieoe? Halg,Lloyd George, Asquith or Grey to be tried by a foreigntribunal?      They admitted that the men domanded by Englandwere, for the most part, in an altogether different category,Tort even in their case they felt sure that the Governmentwould hot have the power to fulfil its promise to surrenderthem.     It w ould not be a question of turning out the presentGovernment and replacing it by another.,   No Government couldfulfil the pledge and if the demand were pressed Bolshevismwas inevitable.     This question was exciting the keenestinterest and indignation at the moment as one that afffccted&apos;the honour of the German People&quot; and I could form no oon-elusion lout that they would fight it to the last,   xGerman bitterness, against the French is indisputable.Almost every conversation that I hea:d in railway carriagesor inns contained some story of alleged French injustice orcruelty - the behaviour of the French Armies of Occupation,the raping of German gir/ls by the French soldiery which wasxSince writing this I have seen the Allied reply of 13thFebruary to the German Note on tho surrender of war criminals.The concessions granted will cause untold relief in Germany and,will, no doubt, do something to revive their belief in the Alllesense of justice.    I have no doubt that most of the creditfor the change of policy will Toe attributed to British states^manship.
9 k f-l4&apos;J *J t)/alleged to be still continuing, brutality to the inhabitantsin the oocupied areas, excessive penalties for trivial offences,(e.g. two months imprisonment or a fine of 10,000 marks forbeing in possession of a certain kind of knife which wasprohibited), and the general aggressiveness and lust for vengeanceon the part of the Prench - these were the universal topics ofconversation.     It was &apos;intensely interesting to compare, in thespace of a few days, the attitude of the population in Mainz,Coblenz, and Cologne.     In Mainz was dogged hostility and bitter-ness;   in Coblenz,relief at tho departure of the Americans wasfollowed by the hope of English rule, which in turn gave place todismay at the prospective coming of the French;   in Cologne wasa marked friendliness to the English which was nfit only theresult sf the immense outward prosperity brought by Britishgold, but was very largely duo to our justice and the goodbehaviour of our troops.Although the Auslieforungsfrage was the most general subjectof conversation, I am convinced that material considerationsare of really far greater import in the lives and thoughts of thepeople.     The present stagnation of industry, tho apparentimpossibility of recovery without coal, raw material, and trans-port, the high prices and increasing shortage of food and milk,are sapping the vitality of the Hation.     She can see no light;she finds herself between the devil and the deep sea.     Evensupposing her conviction that industrial recovery is, in presentcircumstances, impossible should prove to be unfounded, stillwhat hope is there?      She feels that the more she works and themore money she earns, the greater will be the French demandsfor reparation (all Allied demands are attributed to Frenchgreed).      Unless the appetite of the French is checked, thereis nothing ahead but Bolshevism.     A small minority in the townsare already hoping for &quot;the coming of the Russians&quot; but the vastmajority of all classes look on the prospect with dread.     Thekey to the problem seems to lie in increasing the facilities andlowering the oust of transport and how this can be effected noone with whom I discussed it was able to suggest, though it wasrecognised that a substantial improvement in the exchange was aparamount&apos;consideration.    Passenger and goods rates have, Ibelieve, -risen by more than 200 per oent, since 1914 and a furtherincrease In the immediate future is announced.   The engines androlling stock are in urgent need of repair, trains are habituallyan hour or so late, and on the Schwarswald railway the worn outengines are constantly breaking down on the gradient aboveOffenbirg.     Unless some,means can be found either to modifythe coal provisions of the Treaty or to supply Germany with theincreased rolling stock which alone ean make possible the revivalof her industry, I feel convinced that there is a real dangerthat even the desire to work which still exists in the Germanpeoplo, will disappear, with results which will be little lessdisastrous ta the Allies than to Germany herself.   The fear ofthe coming of Bolshevism expressed by Germany has been heljk upin the English rress as a mere tactical move on her part,designed to secure concessions frem tho Allies.     But from whatI have myself seen and heard in South Germany I have very littledoubt that (as seems to be the Universal belief there) unlessthe Allied,line of policy now&quot;being pursued is modified in sucha way as td offer some real prospect of a revival of Nationallife and to give the Germans some tangible ground of hope for tho** 5 w
for the future, the Country will automatically fall into astate of anarchy as bad as that of Bolshevist Russia andinfinitely more dangerous to ,/estern Europe.In our own interests it seems to be essential thateconomic and industrial conditions in Germany should improve.In present circumstances the markets of Germany are closedto British trade - it is out of the question for Germany toimport British goods in any appreciable quantity at thepresent rate of exchange.     British and French financierscan, no doubt, profitably invest in German businesses, hotels,etc, - as indeed they are doing extensively in such placesas Baden Baden and wiesbaden - but although this may tendindirectly to steady the exchange for the moment there is adanger that German Labour, when it finds out that it is work-ing for foreign capitalists, may demand impossible terms orwithdraw its services altogether.     Something much more drasticis required to restore confidence in Germany and it is therestoration of confidence in hersd ?that alone, in my opinion,can save her.    The early settlement of the total amount ofreparation to be demanded would contribute more than anythingelse to this end; but short of this, some clear indicationon the part of the Allies that they realise Germany1scondition and are ready to do what they can to assist herto get her industries going in order that she may againbecome solvent, would have a deep effect and would go far tobanish the almost universal apathy and despair prevailing inall classes of the community.
