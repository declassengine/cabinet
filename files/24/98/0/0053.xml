;, This Document Ig the Property of    i &apos;)kJ,^/UM^&apos;^His-&quot;Britannic MaJeSty&apos;8 Governmentft. f     0.^$2.2.20.GOVERNMENT OB1 IRELAND BILL.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I hope the Cabinet will be able to consider the IrishHome Rule Bill very shortly.   It should be presented andpublished at latest-the week after next - preferably atthe end of next week - though this now seems hardly possible -A short memorandum has been circulated with the Bill,setting out the points which have been reserved by theCommittee for decision by the Cabinet.   They are few innumber and, I think, the issues raised are quite clear. Butthey must be decided before the Bill can be introduced.There is one feature of the Bill to which I speciallydesire to call the attention of my colleagues. It is pro-posed that there shall be single Chamber Parliaments inNorth and South Ireland. I am inclined to think that thiswill give rise to considerable criticism, which will pro-bably take two main lines: first, the- general criticism thatwe are abandoning the Tio-Chamber system for the singleChamber plan: second, . that the absence of a Senate deprivesthe loyalists in the South of Ireland of a form of protect-;1ion to which they attach importance. .As regards the first, the Committee have thought it&apos; right to follow the precedent of Canada: the Second Chamberhas been abandoned there in all the old provinces with, Ibelieve,, the exception of one. In the new provinces, when,they were created by the Dominion Parliament, a SecondChamber was not established --and this would seem to beconsistent with the true principles of federalism. Butwhether it should be made clearer than it is In the Bill thatthe Parliament of-the United Kingdom can suspend or annul an&apos;Act of Parliament passed, by the Irish Legislature, as      is:&apos;.the case in the Dominion, may be a matter for consideration.As regards the second line of criticism,. I lam afraidthere is no answer which would be likely to satisfy the Iris]Unionists of the South. They will be naturally afraid ofpredatory legislation, and they will ask what protectionare they given.   The federal answer will probably notsatisfy them - and I doubt even if the existence,of theUlster Parliament, with a Roman Catholic minority, will be asufficient security by way of-possible retaliation, tosatisfy them.It is therefore a question whether some other protectionshould be accorded to them. &apos;I think it right to say that I am circulating thismemorandum without consultation with nty colleagues, on theCommittee.- Fersonnally, I am prepared to defend tho Billas it stands, though I admit the hardship and the diffi-culty of ,the case of the Unionists of the South.   But Ithink the Cabinet ought to have, the facts clearly beforethem, and decide upon the course that is to be adopted.(Intlld)   W.H.L.12.2.20.
