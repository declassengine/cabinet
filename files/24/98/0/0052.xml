The finances of the majority of Dock and HarbourAuthorities have, as my&apos;colleagues are aware, been seriouslyaffected by the dislocation of traffic caused by the War andby heavy increases in wages and the cost of materials.Hitherto these Authorities have, for the most part, been ableto obtain the additional revenue required for the up-keep oftheir undertakings by increasing their charges under Orders.made by. the BS&amp;rd of Trade under D.O,J&quot;i.R. 39 DB and such Ordershave been made f$r 46 undertakings, but the relief thus obtainedis of a temporary nature and will cease with the official endof the War,2.    In view of the uncertainty as to the duration of the  ,powers obtained under these Orders a number of the Dock andHarbour Authorities applied to Parliament last Session forpermanent increase in their statutory rates,    The Board ofTrade in reporting to Parliament under Standing Orders expresseda doubt whether any permanent increases in rates should beauthorised until conditions,had become more normals    Themajority of theae Bills were referred to a Joint Committee ofboth Houses, which, after hearing evidence from the interestedparties, decided to authorise   permanent increases in statutoryrates, except in two &quot;oases in which additional, powers of chargewere conferred for a limited number of years only, ,  Theincreases sanctioned varied between 33 l/3 and 100&amp;3*    This Session we are again faced with the problem ofDock and Harbour finance,and a number of Private Bills andProvisional Orders are being promoted by the Authoritiesconcerned, most of whom are local bodies of Trustees orCommissioners, for the purpose of obtaining increased&quot;chargingpowers *    Their proposals vary considerably, some of theAuthorities seeking a general percentage Increase in theirrates, while others propose to,increase certain olassea ofrates only either by a fixed percentage or by the substitutionof a revised Schedule of Kates for that now in&quot; operation.    Thereare considerable differences also in the amounts of tho increasesproposed, the extent of which.is in some instances as much as100 per cent.4,    The Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, empowered tho -Ministor to take possession of a Harbour or Dock, with theconsent of the owners9 and to give directions, subject toreference to the Dates Advisory Committee set up under theAct, as to the rates etq* to be levied Irrespective of themaxima fixed by Statute,5,    Advantage of this procedure has already been takenby the Port of London Authority who have been charging ratesin excess of their statutory maxima by virtue of an &apos;Orderunder Regulation 39 BB*    On learning that their powers underthe Order would cease on tho termination of the V/ar, theAuthority applied to the Minister -and possession has been takenof their undertaking under Section 5 of the Ministry of TransportAct for tho purpose of authorising an increase in the maximumrates leviable ,
&quot; ^ -6o:    After very oareful consideration I have come to theconclusion that, for the reasons which follow, it isdesirable that the present difficulties of the HarbourAuthorities should be met by the procedure provided by theMinistry of Transport Act rather than by the grant ofstatutory powers of increasing their charges eitherpermanently or temporarily.    The procedure under theMinistry of Transport Act is speedy, economical and providesall the advantages&apos;of elasticity.    Rates can quickly bo&quot;revised by a Departmental Order from time to time to meet,altered&quot;conditions, whereas it normally takes at least sixmonths to obtain further charging powers from Parliament bymeans of a Bill or Provisional Order.7.    The promotion of a Bill or Provisional Order notonly involves the Promoter in considerable expense, but alsoimposes upon Parliament the additional burden&quot; of examining indetail the proposals contained therein,    Moreover, the constantfluctuation in the level of wages and the cost of material atthe present time renders.it almost impossible for Promoters ora Parliamentary Committee to estimate with any accuracy theadditional charging powers that will eventually be needed anda further application may shortly be necessary.    I raaymention that several Dock and Harbour Authorities who obtainedincreases in their maximum rates from Parliament last year areagain promoting Bills this Session to authorise furtherincreasesft&apos; 8*:    It is not possible in the abnormal conditions,existing to-day to frame a permanent policy in regard to thismatter or to deal with, it in any but a piecemeal mannor.&apos;   Ina&apos;year or eighteen months time when matters will, 1 hope, haveattained a degree of comparative stability, we&apos; should be in amuch bettor position to form an opinion as to the permanentnecessities of the case and to formulate a comprehensivepolicy in rogard to the level of charging powers of thesestatutory undertakings with due regard to their future organisationand status *    TJhen that time comes it might well be inconvenientto have a number of Ports with statutory powers enabling themto charge rates at varying percentages above the normal level.9,    1 think it advisable that the Bill3 and ProvisionalOrders promoted this Session by Dock and Harbour Authorities should&apos;not he proceeded with&quot;in so far as they purpose to confer additionalcharging powora, and that the Promoters should be -advised that it isopen to them to apply to the Minister of Transport to take possessionof their undertakings for tho sole purpose of authorising an increasein their rates.10.    If my proposals are approved 1 will endeavour to inducePromoters to withdraw their clausos dealing with increases ofcharging powers, but in the evont of their declining to do so 1suggest that I should be authorised to oppose the grant of - such&apos; &apos;powers in Parliament.(Signed) ERIC GEDDBS.
