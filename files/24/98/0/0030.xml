P. 630.MURAL DECORATION OP THE FOREIGN OFFICE.Memorandum &quot;by the First Commissioner of &quot;?orks.To tho Cabinet,I have to trouble the Cabinet with a question which hasarisen regarding the decoration of tho staircase of theForeign Office.A series of decorations, the work of Mr, SigismundGoetzo, designed for the purpose, are now ready to be placedin position in the panels of the staircase of the ForeignOffice for which they have been created under circumstancessot out in full detail below.   A divergence of opinionhas unfortunately arisen regarding the placing of thesefrescoes in position between the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and myself.   I understand that the Secretaryof State objects to the frescoes being put up by my Depart-ment, which it at present is being pressed to do by theArtist, who has completed his work for some considerabletime, and who is, now asking to be relieved of their custody,and that they should be taken over by the Government.   Ihave had considerable correspondence with the Secretary ofState with a view to his agreeing to these frescoes beingput up.     Unfortunately, no agreement has been arrived atbetween us and as the original decision and approval forthese decorations were given by the Cabinet of Mr.Asquith&apos;sGovernment of 1914, I feel that my only course is to placethe whole question before the present Cabinet for decision.The facts are shortly as follows:-At tho Royal Academy dinner in 1912 the Archbishopof Canterbury suggested that it would be a great advantageto the Administrators, of this Country if they could besurrounded by beautiful artistic decoration and wondered whysome of the great artists of the Country did not offertheir services in this respect.   He considered that beautifulsurroundings tended to create fine ideas and high ideals.The only outcome of this speech was an offer fromthe Artist, Mr. Sigismund Goetze, who placed his services atthe disposal of the Government to paint a panel or completelydecorate a room in one of the great Bublic Buildings.     TheArchbishop communicated this offer to Lord $eauchamp, thethen First Commissioner of Works.   Lord Be$&amp;chanp receivedMr. Goetze, discussed the matter with him&quot;, and instructed anefficer of this Department to take him round various PublicBuildings in order to sec what struck his fancy.   The positionwhich appealed most to him was the panels at the top of thestaircase at the Foreign Office, and he then proceeded toprepare a rough model, including email sketch designs of hisproposed scheme of treatment.In May 1914 the model was sent to the Foroign Office andseen in the first instance by Lord Beauchamp and Sir EdwardGrey, the Foreign Secretary    /
Secretary. It wos afterwards seen at 10,Downing street by theCabinet who decided to accept the Artist&apos;s generous offer.&quot;on one 7th May, 1914, Mr.ffoetze made a request that his giftif accepted should be considered as far as possible an anonymousone.     On the 13th May, 1914, Lord B-eauohamp sent Mr. GOetzethe following letter:-f,I n&quot;ave now seen both the Prime Minister and the&quot;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    They&quot;commissidn me to accept your generous (and&quot;anonymous)offer with warmest thanks.     His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Government has every reason to appreciate the&quot;very generous rift which you are good enough to&quot;offer.&quot;A small committee will probably be appointed&quot;to consult with you upon one or two matters of&quot;detail and to consider any question of international&quot;relations such as must inevitably arise.    But&quot;you shall be kept fully informed on these matters.&quot;Let me add an expression of my personal&quot;appreciation of your gift - which is of a kind&quot;all too rare in England to-day.Lord 3eauchamp agreed at that time with Sir Edward Orey to appointa small committee to consider all matters of detail in connectionwith the panels so as to ensure that the subjects representedwere not likely to clash in any way with diplomatic amenities.There were to be two representatives nominated by the ForeignOffice and Lord Beauchamp appointed Sir Lionel Earle to representhim and his DepartmentiMr. Goetze set to work on the panels and at the end of 1914had two ready to erecf, but it was decided, In view of the war and   -the great pressure of work at the Foreign Office, that it wouldbe impossible to allow them to be erected at that time.The Office of W(Sfks had to store some of the completed panels   .at Hertford House in-order to free Mr. Goetze&apos;s Studio.In January 1919 after the Armistice Mr, Goetze applied to beallowed to erect the panels and the following reply dated the20th January from Sir Lionel Earle was sent;-,6^&quot;In reply to your letter of yesterday, I&quot;have been to the Foreign Office and obtained&quot;permission for you to see the original of the&quot;famous &quot;Scrap of Paper&quot; in that Department.&quot;If you will kindly communicate with the Librarian&quot;Mr. I7.. Parkes, at the Foreign Office and state&quot;a time when convenient for you to call, he will&quot;have the document ready.     He has be*en instruct-&quot;ed to be prepared for this comnvXhication from you.&quot;There is no reason, as far as I can see,&quot;why the panels that are finished should not now&quot;be placed in position.     In fact now is a very&quot;favourable moment as so many of the Foreign&quot;Office strff f are away in Paris for the Peace&quot;Conference, but before this could be allowed,&quot;it would be necessary for the Committee, which&quot;Lord. Eeauchamp arranged for, of Foreign Office&quot;officials to inspect the panels to see that
-A-&quot;there was nothing likely to oause any difficulties&quot;or &quot;ennuis&quot; in the future.     The only panel,&quot;where I think any controversy might occur, is&quot;the one that you are now working on, and it is a&quot;question whether you Winrtld prefer what is done&quot;to be examined now and erected, or wait until&quot;you have finished the debatable panel and have&quot;them all viewed at that time.     Perhaps you&quot;will kindly let me know, and I could arrange to&quot;visit both those at Hertford House and those at&quot;your own Studio at any time convenient to you.&quot;I should like of course, you to be present at&quot;both places in order to explain the general&quot;scheme to the Foreign Office representatives.&quot;I do not think you need be concerned about&quot;your relationship with Sir Alfred as you have&quot;always expressed a desire that the gift should&quot;be anonymous.     Although I do not think it will&quot;be possible to keep this secret for very long,&quot;I am a strong witness to the fact that SirAlfred, had nothing to do with the whole scheme,&quot;nor has he touched, on it in any way even sinoe&quot;he has taken Office&quot;.Lord Curzon, who was acting as Secretary of State duringMcBalfou^s absence in Paris, appointed Sir John Tilleyand Mr.Victor Wellesley to examine the panels which had beencompleted and asked that one of them should be erected inthe Foreign Offloe in order that he might see the effect.The Foreign Office representatives reported that they con-sidered it was desirable that certain alterations should bemade in the large central panel.     One pan el-f&quot; BritanniaBellatrix&quot; was temporarily hung at the top of the staircasein the Foreign Office and is still in position.,     Lord Surzon has, I understand., visited Mr.Groetze!s Studioand seen the remaining panels, and I believe objects to theirbeing placed in the Foreign Office on artistic grounds, buthas suggested appointing a Committee composed of the followinggentlemen to advise&quot;him on the whole matter:-The Director of the Hational Gallery.The Director of the Tate Gnllery.The Director of&quot;the Victoria &amp; Albert MuseumandE.A.painter nominated by the President of theRoyal Academy.To this Committee Mr.Goetze objects en the groundsthat not one of the first three gentlementproposed has everwritten a line upon or evinced an interest in the Art ofMural Decoration although I understand that he will be willingto submit his work io a Committee nominated by the Presidentor the Executive Committee of the Royal Academy.To my mind a very important question of principle hasarisen for the Cabinet to decide, viz;-Whether if one Government formally accepts and gives throughthe First Commissioner of Works a commission to any Artist orArtists, who&apos;on the name and face of this commission carriesout the work, is it right or proper when the work is completed,for a subsequent Government, or any Member thareof, to repudiatethe engagement entered into by his predecessor?It/
107It seems to me that this is a question quite   independentof the artistic merit or views of any partioular body ofindividuals at any given time as to the art value of sucha work. .   There are no definite canons that can possibly belaid down regarding matters of art and opinions are bound tovary whether they are the opinions of. laymen or the opinionsof any so-called experts..     I&apos; would therefore submit that thequestion o-f the Artist in this oase submitting his work to aCommittee, a condition which was never imposed,when thearrangement with him was entered intok is irrelevant to theissue in question:and an extremely unfair imposition to imposeon any artist.Again, such a reversion of policy would be one of far-reaching importance to anyone holding the office of FirstCommissioner of Works.     In virtue Of his Office, the FirstCommissioner is naturally more in touch with the world ofartists than any Other Minister.     It falls to him in hisofficial capacity to be responsible for the giving of comm-issions to artists on behalf of the Government, of.importantmonuments for instahoe, and in fact, several important statueswill have to be dealt with by ma as First Commissioner in thenear future.     If artists feel that when they have executeda commission so given and hate devoted a great deal of iimeand work in carrying it out, that the results of their labourwill run the jeopardy of being rejected, at the Ijasi moment,with all the laws of prestige which this may involve, it willbecome extremely difficult for any Minister to accept an-ysuch responsibility or to obtain artists of the first ranksto accept Government work.The question for the Cabinet to decide is&quot; whether theacceptance by the late Cabinet of an offer by an Artist wichoutwithout remuneration,  or a definite position in a GovernmentBuilding, can be revoked by the present Secretary,of State,who was&apos;not a member of that Cabinet.     The Artist hasdevoted seveii years of his life to jbnis work at ah immenseexpense to himself, and it appears to me that if iihe attitudeof the Secretary, of State on this matter is endorsed by thepresent Cabinet,\ it will strike at the security of any Artistin the future who is in course of executing any National wort.I would therefore ask the Cabinet to decide in favourof allowing me to take the necessary Steps to place thesedecorations in position in the Foreign Office.(Signed) AI.F.1sb MOfiH.H.M.Office of Works.13th February, 1920.0
