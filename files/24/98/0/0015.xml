Ireland,The proposals outlined in the House of Commons on December 22nd, by the Prime Minister with regard to the future government of Ireland, are dealt with by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; in a leading article. The article is occupied mainly in establishing the right of the Irish people to self-determination and in developing the implications involved in this principle, but no attempt is made to meet the difficulty of Ulster. The &quot; Labour Pioneer &quot; insists that IrelancTs only hope lies now in Labour. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &apos;&quot; The Call,&quot; on the other hand, are somewhat doubtful as to the intentions of the Parlia-mentary Labour Party. Mr. F. Willis, in the latter paper, shows more hostility to them than he does to the Government. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; wholeheartedly praises the Prime Ministers solution of the Irish problem.Unemployment Insurance.In a somewhat confused article, the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; discusses the reversion, on the cessation of the civilian out-of-work donation, to Part II of the Insurance Act, 1911, and in particular the payments which may be made to trade unions under sec. 106 of that Act. It doubts whether the repayment to trade unions of one-sixth of their expenditure on unemployment benefit is a sufficiently great attraction to compensate the trade unions for the additional administrative expenditure involved, but draws attention to the fact that applications may be made for modifications in the administrative details of the scheme. This paper has always been hostile to the Exchanges and takes this opportunity to insist that the trade unions provide ample machinery for the administration of unem-ployment insurance and that the Employment Exchanges are not really needed.Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.The outstanding feature of the Labour situation this week is the attitude of the railwaymen towards the Governments offer for the standardisation of wages and the control of the industry. At the moment it is uncertain what decision will ultimately be reached by the special general meeting of the N.U.R., which is at present in session, and it would be rash to predict. It may, however, be said that it seems unlikely that the railway-men will take immediate drastic steps. It is more probable that they will instruct their negotiating committee to endeavour to obtain certain amendments of the terms in specified -directions. One consideration which suggests that in the meantime at least further negotia-tion will be preferred to a strike is that a resolution passed at the meeting of the Triple Alliance on the 27th November, 1919, provides that in the event of a failure of any of the three bodies to secure their demands, a full meeting of the three executives should be summoned to consider the matter. Now, both of the other two members of the Alliance have in the meantime chosen negotiation rather than striking with a view to the attain-ment of the objects of their respective programmes. The miners will take no drastic steps to secure the nationalisation of the mines unless their present campaign of propaganda fails to convince the country, and in any case nothing will probably be done until the special Trades Union Congress about the end of February. The Transport Workers&apos; Federation have just referred their programme to a Court of Inquiry, and it must be some weeks until its decision is known. In the circumstances it seems rather unlikely that the two bodies which are at present treading the peaceful paths of negotiation and propaganda would lend their support to the N.U.R. in an appeal to the.harsh, decision of industrial action. The Transport Workers&apos; Federation especially have also probably other good reasons for not desiring to be involved in a strike.Another feature of the situation is the growing tendency for the rank and file to decline to accept the recommendations of their leaders. In the case of the railwajTnen, the leaders&apos; recommendations in favour of acceptance of the terms were very strong; yet these have apparently carried comparatively little weight with the men. And the figures of the ironmoulders&apos; ballot show that a large majority of the men refuse to accede to their leaders&apos;.appeal to return to work, although that appeal is backed by the authority of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.
