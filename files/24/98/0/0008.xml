But as it is now very difficult to obtain thenecessary shipping, and as in any case the cost of said shipping would exceed the smallfunds we have to our disposal, we hope the British Government will come forward withhelp in this case purely in the cause of humanity.As you know the British Government have sequestered many ships of, ourVolunteer fleet, and it is to be hoped that in this case the Government would allow usto use for this purpose some of these ships under the British flag. At the presentmoment 4 of these steamers are lying in English ports :  y&quot; Kursk &quot;     .........&quot; Krasnoyarsk&quot;      ...      ...&quot;Vologda&quot;   ..........&quot;Voronej&quot;   .........If we should be allowed to use these, ships for repatriating the men from Reval tothe Black Sea. we could dispose of the necessary sums for these purposes without anyfinancial aid from the British Government.You would very much oblige me by putting these considerations before theSecretary of State for War, and in any case try to have the views of the BritishGovernment on the question of the above repatriation.Yours sincerely,T.
