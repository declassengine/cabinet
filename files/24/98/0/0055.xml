A PROPOSED MINISTRY OF MINES.W (Circulated by the Home Secretary).It will be necessary for the Cabinet in connection with the proposal for thecreation of a Ministry of Mines, to consider whether the duties and powers of theHome Offioe for the protection of the safety and health of the workers employed inthe industry should remain with my Department or should be transferred to the newMinistry.    The scheme submitted by the President of the Board of Trade in hismemorandum of the 17th December last proposed to transfer them.    I am of opinionthat there are weighty reasons against the transfer which should receive thecareful attention of the Cabinet.    The effect of the transfer would in the firstplace be to divorce the work of safeguarding the health and safety of the minerfrom the work of safeguarding the health and safety of other olasseB of industrialworkers.    I am satisfied that a very great loss inefficiency would result fromthe division.    Different as the conditions of work&apos;in the mines are in manyimportant respects from the conditions in faotories and other industries, many ofthe questitns that have to be dealt with are the same or similar - the use ofelectricity for instance, or&quot; the prevention of fibroid phthisis.    It would bealmost impassible to separate in practice the treatment of the fibroid phthisisproblem in the ganister mines from the treatment of the same problem in thefaotories where the ganister is used for manufacturing purposes.    Also* the generalprinciples whioh govern the Statefs action for the protection of the workers arethe Bame, and the administrative experience gained in connection with the one classof industry is invaluable in dealing with the other.    It would be diffioult to .maintain anything like uniformity of action if the work was divided betweendifferent Departments.    Another difficulty is that in many cases the differentindustries are oarried on by the same firm in the same place - and the division ofthe work between two Departments would give rise to serious inoonvenienoe.In the seoond place, the transfer would place the protective work of theGovernment in the hands of the Department whioh was responsible for productionand for the finanoial position of the industry.    There would be grave danger ofthe protective work suffering from the connection, and at any rate there would bea tendency for labour in any dispute arising, to suspect that it was beingsacrificed to the necessities of output or finanoe.    In the oa6e of the Departmentswhich carry on manufacturing operations, Parliament has always insisted (seeSection 150 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901) on an independent supervisionbeing exercised by the Home Office so far as regards the measures for safety andhealth*.    I have little doubt that this prinoiple is right, and I am sure thatLabour would take strong objeotion to the transfer of the duties of the FactoryInspectors in Woolwioh Arsenal and other munition works to the War Offioe or to theMinistry of Munitions.16th February. 1920.*There iB also an arrangement in existence between the General Post Offioe and HomeOffioe by whioh the Faotory Inspeotors, when asked, inspect premises in theoccupation of the Post Offioe.    This arrangement was the outoome of complaintsmade by Post Offioe employees of insanitary conditions on Post Offioe premises.
