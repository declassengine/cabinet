This is no doubt a substantial burden, but Itrust it will not be taken as a conclusive argument against the proposal.The question is one of justice as well as of public policy. These men have workedall their lives on the assumption that a pension, which bore a correspondence to acertain minimum living standard, would be available for them in their old age. Thepensions as at present fixed cannot possibly enable them in most cases to supportthemselves, owing to the fact that the purchasing power of money has fallen more thana half. This is a thoroughly unjust, cruel and wrong state of things and ought not tobe tolerated.It must not be forgotten that the Revenue benefits enormously by the declinein the purchasing power of money. The nominal value of the income of thecountry has been nearly doubled. Although the quantities of goods produced andavailable for enjoyment have actually diminished, the nominal values of these goodshave enormously increased. This means that the income assessable to Income Tax isvastly increased, though people are no richer. As so much of our taxation is thesubject of progressive graduation, the higher grades are now in all cases reached bypeople with half the real wealth that they had previously. The same is true of Super-Tax and Death Duties. Through this decline in the purchasing power of money,therefore, the Treasury is obtaining an increased revenue of scores of millions a year;and if this be true, it seems to me that they should face the other side of the accountand meet the obligations, as well as enjoy the revenue, which arise from the same eviLcause.The War Office,Wth February, 1920.WINSTON S.
