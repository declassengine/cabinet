(THIS DOCUMENT IS TKL PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTY&apos;S n-QVERMivi IsIT) .SECRET.C.P.6SS. C a B I NET.POSITION......OF&apos; ESTABLISHED DOCKYARD WORKMEN IN RELATION TO STRIKES.Memorandum by,the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Memorandum (CP.644) circulated at myrequest by Mr. Long regarding the action of two establishedfounders in Portsmouth Dockyard 7tfio took part in the recentstrike of Ironfounders raises a problem of considerable -difficulty and of serious and far-reaching importance from: the point of view of the Public Service as a whole.   In myopinion it is impossible to decide the particular case ofthese men without regard to the general questions ofprinciple involved and, if that is the case, the positionthat has arisen is one that gravely affects the Establishmentsystem in the Civil Service&apos;, and the foundations upon whichthat system rests.The chief feature attaching to the system isthe Right to a Pension v/hich an Established employee enjoys,in contra-distinction to the hired porkers who have notbeen established,, and the grant of this right by the State&apos;forms part of a definite policy.One of the main objects of this sysUMi v,:as toserve as an inducement to th se employees to remain loyalto the State, and as a guarantee against their participationin strikes which is of course contrary to the obligationsentered into by  hem on Establishment.If it is decided in the present case that theseEstablished workmen are to be fully reinstated and thattheir participation in a strike, though contrary to theterms of the agreement entered into between them and theState, is not to involve any loss or diminution of Pension
fights, then it seema to me that the jusi&amp;fication of thePension system is to a very large extent done away with,and that the whole future of this sy ton ought to bereconsidered.   I reaognise to the full the difficultiesat the present time of punishing employees for partici-pation in a strike, especially In view or the growingstrength of the Trade Unions * but on the other hand anyfailure to take action against them which1 could be regardedas tantamount to a recognition of the right of Establishedemployees to strike with impunity, would have far-reachingeffects of a very serious character throughout the industrialestablishments of our Government Departments, and mightaffect even the clerical classes in the Civil Service.The problem is full of difficulty and theCabinet must seriously consider the present case in thelight of the effect which may be produced by their decisionthroughout the public service.   On the one hand there fallsto b^ considered the attitude   of the Trade Unions, whichdo not regard the Sstablishment system with favour and wouldwelcome any event which tended to v/eaken its influence asa stabilising factor.   On the other hand the Cabinet mustConsider the Interests of the Civil Service.   If the termsof the agreement between the State and the employees arenot. enforced^ and it is recognised that Established employees *who break that agreement by participation in a strike, areto be allowed the full privileges attaching to the Establish-ment system, the value of the system is gravely impaired.(Iiitd)   A.C.Treasury, S.&apos;v.,February 19th, 1920.
