,  (TOIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVBTOIEII11).SECRET,CABINET.    -0 ,P,.-*602,.^     EMERGENCY MEASURES FOR OUT OP WORK PAY IN THE EVENT OF Aw STRIKE IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES,Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour,1,   In view of the possibility of a stoppage of essentialservices at any time owing to a strike It la important todefine in advance the polioy which the Government intends totake aa regards out-of-work pay.2,   In the railway strike of September 1919, it was decided to,pay donation to all non-strikers.    The rates for ex-membersof H.M, Forces were to be those to which they were entitledunder the ordinary scheme, but civilians were to receive donationflatat a reduced/rate of 25/- for married men 15/- for single menand 12/- for women.    It should be remembered that at thattime the Donation Scheme for oivilian workers was still in forceso that the decision meant merely continuing during tha stridethe existing rights under the scheme with a modification of theweekly rates payable to civilians for the purpose of achievingsimplicity in prooeduere.3,   At present the only persons entitled to Donation are ex-membersof H,M, Forces and Merchant Seamen.   Civilians to the numberof about 3f millions (i.e. those employed in insured trades] areentitled t*) Unemployment Benefit at the rate of ll/r a week.This is a statutory right of whichthe insured workers could notbe deprived except by Act of Parliament.   Adding these classestogether and making some allowance for over-lapo Utg the totalnumber at present covered by donation or unemployment benefit may beput at from 6$ to 7 millions i.e. rather less than half the totalnumber of workpeople in the country. (4*   Since it is incumbent on the Government to pay UnemploymentBenefit to insured workpeople and donation to ex-members ofH.M. Forces and Merchant Seamen the large numbers, who, in the caseof/
Of a strike will have to be dealt with make it essential thatthe rates of donation should be simplified during the emergencyperiod.5.   A certain amount of simplification was attempted for thaperiod of the railway strike in the casa of cirilian workersbut not of ex-members of H.M. Forces (safe paragraph 2).   Thatstrike fortunately ended in a week, but the experience thengained makes it clear that a much greater degree of simplificationin the rates of emergenoy donation is imperative, and that thecomplications still retained on that occasion couldnot have &quot;been adhered to if the strike,had continued for alonger period.    The only workable sohame for payment ofdonation to ex-servioe men, on the vast scale hero contemplatedas possible, is that there should be only two rates. viae thosefor men and women respectively (with half rates for boys andgirla so far as they are included).   It is proposed therefore thatthere should be a single rate of 20/* for men and 15/- for womenwith half these rateg for boys and girls between the ages of16 and 18.    There would be no supplementary donation in respectof children below the age of 16.    The rates proposed would applyboth to those persona who were on donation before the emergency andto those who came on afterwards.    The rates proposed are identicalwith those at present being paid to ex-members of H.M. Forces whohave exhausted the first 39 weeks of donation and to merchantseamen.    They are higher than Unemployment Benefit for the insuredtrades but lower than the rate3 payable to ex-raembers of H*M.J*orcesduring the first 39 weeks.6.   For administrative reasons it is necessary that the specialdonation should not be counted ayainst the ordinary donation.   It, lafurther suggested that in the case of ex-members of H.M.Foroes fchrfperiod o$ one year in which they may draw their first 39 weeksdonation should be extended by a period equal to the duration o the emergency.
*fi\     In the case of Unemployment Benefit iwhich is fixed at therate of 11/- a week) the amount obtainable depends on the number ofcontributions paid and the days of benefit previously received,and if the rules were to be strictly enforced reference to thestate of the workmanrs account as shown by the records in Londonwould in many cases be necessary before payment could be made9Even if the great numbers involved during such a strike could behandled in this way, the absence of postal facilities wouldmake such reference to London impossible.   It is therefore proposedthat payment of benefit up to (say) four weeks should be authorisedlocally without reference to the records in London*This wil^L result in a certain number, of payments beingmade which are not due and it is suggested that the method ofdealing with these payments , (i.e. whether they should be chargedto the Unemployment Fund or to the Treasury) should be arrangedbetween myself and the Treasury, after obtaining advice as to the-legality of charging them to the Unemployment Fund,8t     Under the Unemployment insurance Scheme wlaimanls have tofulfil a waiting period of 6 lays before their unemploymentcounts for benefit, and it is proposed that a similar conditionshould apply to applicants for donation who had not becomeunemployed and made claim for donation before the first day ofthe emergency period,9.      It will be essential as already mentioned that the co-opera-tion of employers shall be obtained and with a view to making theprocedure as simple as possible it is suggested that they should beauthorised to pay donation to all ex-members of H.M4Forces who werein their employment at the commencement of the emergency and whocan produce certificates of discharge from the Forces.   If it becamenecessary to bring the emergency scheme into operation before31st March this propo&amp;O-l might involve after 26th January some riskof over-paying those ex members -of H*NUForces who have exhausted
their original 39 weeks of donation and the additional 9 weeksrecently granted.   The numbers involving such an error, bowevei4,would be very small and as the checking of such over-paymentwould necessitate complicated machinery which employers wouldprobably decline to adopt it is suggested that the small riskinvolved in the proposal should be run.   If the emergencyscheme did not operate before 31st March employers would betold to pay only those men whose discharge papers showedthat&apos;they had left the colours less than thirteen months beforethe commencement of the emergency and who had therefore notexhausted their donation rights.10.    . The proposals in this memorandum have been agreed to bythe Treasury and I should be glad to receive the early approvalof the Cabinet in order that the necessary instructions may beprepared by the staff of my DepartmentsR.S.HORNE.5th February, 192C.
