TMote by the Chancellor of the Loxoheflnesr on,theMpEip^andum of j^^.^^f^^ sj-^a?I am glad that tho General Staff have raised thequestions discussed in their Memorandum.   I understandthat stebs have already been taken by the,Supreme Couil-oil to deal v;ith the question of the tiial of WarCriminals and with that of the armed forces to be allowedto Germany.   I am in substantial, though not completeagreement with the views of the General Satff on thesequestions.But, I desire to make one comment and ask one questionon their financial and economic proposal.My comment is that we cannot raise a loan for Germany^Money would not be subscribed for the pv-rpose, securitycannot be taken and we cannot add to our load of obligations^Even if it were possible, the adoption of the proposalwould bring us into direct confliot with our Allies towhom we have refused any further assistance of the samekind./This being so and yet recognising as I do the realityof the danger to which the General otaif call attention,(the
