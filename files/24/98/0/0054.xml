C0NF1DENT1AU VTT* J     ..       alb&apos;^ ^ ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITAHNIO liAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTGOAL     POLICY.J^yj Memorandum by^the Minister of Health.I have read with much&quot;interest the Memorandumof the President of the Board of Trade (CP.513) with theoutlines of a suggested Bill for a Ministry of Mines,I think that all who have examined this subject in detailare ccnyinsed that such a Ministry or department isnecessary and desirable, and I am in agreement with thisview,     I do not,, however^ think that either in the InterimCommittee or in the Permanent Council of a possible fubureMinistry of r;ines, or in the District Committees asproposed., the mine-workers are given a real share in theeffective direction and policy of the industry,, whetherlocally or nationally,      I do not think that any profit-sharing scheme would be likely to be attractive to labour,and I am convinced that the only effective alternativepolicy to meet the scheme for nationalisation must be togive to labour (and to representatives of the consumer inrespect of prices) a real share in the policy and conductof the industry..I understand that the Compulsory DistrictAmalgamation proposal is&apos;unacceptable to both parties, butis there not a middle course between this and that of theDistrict Committee with the limited advisory or other powers\    as contained in the proposals before us ?     I think there is^ould it not be possible to set up a DistrictBoard with Dowers of direction and policy over the mines inthe area which, subject to the limits of such control, wouldpreserve their independence ?     It should not, I suggest, beimpossible to frame such a scheme thereby the Workers1representatives on such a Board would h.:ve such powers aswould/
would satisfy reasonable men.    Their claim for someeffective share in the direction of the industry is, Ithink, a fair one, and I do not think that any scheme thatfails to meet it can provide the basis for a settlement.Ministry of Health. C. .&amp;D8IS0N.14th February, 1920.
