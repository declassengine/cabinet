[Tkis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1920.SECRET.C.P.-655.&amp; 3i *CABINET.COMMITTEE ON DE-CONTROL OF FOOD.(Reference : Cabinet Conference, February 3, 1920, Minute 1.)Chairman&apos;s Interim Report.ON the 3rd February, 1920&quot;, the Cabinet appointed the following Committee to meetand examine the whole question of the future of Food Control and of the WheatSubsidy, and, with de-control as the ultimate aim, to make recommendations to theCabinet :-The President of the Board of Education (in the Chair).The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Food.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Labour.The Secretary for Scotland.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Minister of Shipping.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Mr. P. Wicks, Secretary:The Committee held two meetings, and had before them the following papers : Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (D.C.F.-1).Statement prepared by the Ministry of Food (D.C.F.-2).Memoranda by the Ministry of Food (D.C.F.-3.)Wheat Production in the United Kingdom. Memorandum by the Minister ofof Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-589).De-control of Meat.-Memorandum by the Food Controller (C.P.-587).Owing to the very confidential nature of some of the matters raised, it was agreedthat the usual Minutes, should not be circulated, and I was requested to prepare aReport for the Cabinet summarising the recommendations of the Committee and thechief considerations which had led to their adoption.I. Wages and Prices.The fundamental question of financial policy confronted the Committee at the outset.The Bread Subsidy which was estimated to cost 50 millions per annum is now costing56^ millions, and if the loaf is to continue to be retailed at its present price the subsidywill rise to 80 million pounds in the next financial year. Similarly, unless prices areraised it may become necessary to subsidise sugar and butter. The case of bacon ismore doubtful. The economic position of each of these commodities will be discussedin detail later, hut, broadly, the question which the Cabinet has to decide is : Shouldprices be put up and new cycles of wage increases be started throughout industry, orshould the State continue the system of subsidies and endeavour gradually to reducethem as market conditions permit.   There are formidable arguments for either course.[2320] B
.Jf .the.prices of bread,, sugar, butter, bacon, rice and jam are raised, demands foradvances in wages will immediately be made by the railwaymen, the woollen industry,the leather industry and others whose wages automatically move with the cost of livingindex number. Advances in other cases governed by the Industrial Court willinevitably follow. In some of these cases as prices recede wages will again automaticallyfall, but it is certain this will only happen with much friction, and equally certain thatin industries not working to a sliding scale there will he most determined opposition towage reductions. In the present temper of labour, higher wages are likely to takemuch longer than usual to influence efficiency favourably. The immediate politicalsituation has also to be borne in mind. The miners are unrestful, and have publicly putforward a demand not for an increase in wages but for a reduction in the cost ofliving, and they have asked that the surplus profits of their industry should beearmarked for this purpose. For the Government at this moment to put up priceswill be taken as a deliberate challenge to the miners, and will also he denounced asplaying into the hands of the profiteers.On the other side is the grave international situation. There is no prospect of afall in prices. No great increases in the supply of the chief commodities are in sight.The immense stores of grain alleged to be stored in. Eussia cannot be moved to theports. The United States, having gone &quot; dry,&quot; is consuming greatly increasedquantities of sugar. The depleted pig population of this jountry and of Denmark cannotbe replenished under from nine to twelve months. The American packers dominate thebacon market and will exploit it to the utmost until alternative supplies are forth-coming. An increase in the Government subsidies will not keep prices down, but willonly add to our inflated credit and be followed by a further rise of prices. To raise thebread subsidy to  80 million will mean more , paper. To raise wages is preferable tothis course, as wages must be paid out of production, or sooner or later they will bereduced or not paid at all.This latter view was shared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Labour, and it was the view which commended itself to the Committee generally asthe sound policy for the Government. It was agreed to beimportant to justify it fullyto the public and that its application should yary with the circumstances of eachcommodity and with due regard to the industrial situation during the next few weeks.II. Wheat and the Bread Subsidy.It has been stated above that, with the f quartern loaf at 9^., the WheatCommission estimate a rise in the Bread Subsidy to  80 million. Australian wheat iscosting us 77/2 and Argentine wheat 102/- in our ports. No help will be availablefrom Australia, where the crop is short and where any surplus is being sold to Japanand the markets of the Pacific. There is plenty of good wheat in the Plate, but theexports are limited by the capacity of the ports. Overseas tonnage as nowhere thedifficulty. To abolish the subsidy would raise the price of&apos; the loaf to -1/Sd. TheCommittee were of the opinion i that the highest rise which could be faced was to l/-for the 4-lb. loaf. The proposal to provide an inferior loaf at a lower price (as well as aloaf of higher, quality) was not favoured for several reasons: (a.) An elaborate inspectorial staff would be required to protect the public frombeing charged the higher price for the lower quality.(b.) To raise the degree of extraction of the berry from the present (and pre-war)figure of 76 per cent, to, say, 81 per cent, would only save the Treasuryabout  5 million, or about five-eighths of a penny on the 4-lb, loaf,(c.) Workmen would base their demands for higher wages on the price of thedearer loaf.The; Committee therefore recommend that the price of the 4-lb. loaf should beraised toil/- and that for the present it should neither be depreciated inquality nor should there be two qualities placed on the market.III. Sugar.The representatives of the Treasury, the Ministry of Food, and the SugarCommission are all agreed that an early rise in the price of sugar is necessary, butthere is some difference of opinion as to the date on which- it should be imposed and asto the desirability of accompanying the rise with an increase in the sugar ration.
Sugar is at present being sold below the world price with the help of profits accumulatedin the past by the Sugar Commission. These reserves will have totally disappeared.bythe first week in August on the present basis, and it will then be necessary to raiseprices to the point of covering cost or to subsidise. To do the former would mean anadvance of more than 50 per cent., i.e., from Sd. to 12^d. It was recognised that a riseof 50 per cent, was most ^undesirable, and that some intermediate steps should be taken..The financial reserves would last until October if the price were put up by 2d. per lb.from May 1st. The Chancellor of the Exchequer pressed for an advance from-March 1 st, and the Food Controller urged a date at least a month later, so that theseasonal reductions in the price of dairy products might begin to operate by way ofcompensation.It was shown in the course of the discussion that the United States were likely torequire 1,000,000 tons more than their usual share of the Cuban harvest, and would beprepared to go to any price to obtain their full supply of sugar either from Java orelsewhere. The European beet crop was too uncertain to base any hopes upon it. Allthe signs pointed to the conclusion that the immediate increase of supply would notappreciably exceed the growing demand. The low allowance of 6 oz. was at present causingmuch irritation, and doctors and teachers were very eager to see it increased in theinterest of the health of the children. The pre-war rate of consumption had been from16 oz. to 20 oz.The Committee * agreed to recommend that the price should be advanced forgrocery sugars from 8d. to lOd. at the time of the Budget statement, and theamount of the ration should be reviewed at the same time.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to this conclusion on the understandingthat whatever reserves remained should be used to bridge over the gulf between thesale price and replacement cost, and that if these proved insufficient there should be nofurther recourse to the Treasury.IV.- Butter.Imported butter is now selling at 2s.- Sd. per lb., and its replacement cost is 3s.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Food Controller are agreed that the priceshould be put up at once to not less than 3s.The Treasury would prefer Government trading to cease altogether not later thanthe end of April or, failing complete de-control, that a reasonable maximum priceshould be retained, and retailers asked to give their registered customers the 1-oz. rationbefore giving others more.- The Food Controller wishes the ration raised to 2 oz., and objects to de-controlbecause, while it is true that there is no shortage of margarine, working-class familiesvalue highly the present ration, and its withdrawal and the consequent uncertaintiesof supply would cause loud complaints. The modified control suggested by theTreasury is, in the opinion of the Food Ministry, impracticable. They say it wouldbe extremely difficult to fix the proper maximum price, as prices in the countries oforigin vary widely, and control of maximum prices only has been found by experienceto lead to great inequalities in distribution.The Committee were agreed that the price of imported butter should be put upat once to not less than 3s. per lb., the ration to remain unaltered.V. Cheese.The supplies of cheese have for some months been fairly ample, and, so far as canbe foreseen, the outlook is good for many months to come certainly better than inthe allied case of butter. For these reasons the Departments concerned were agreeableto the de-control of cheese, and in this proposal the Committee concurred.VI. Bacon.Complete control of bacon was reimposed by the Ministry of Food in August 1919,and the Ministry has now stocks and contracts sufficient to supply all needs for probablysix months. Since 1918 supplies have come mainly from the United States, with theresult that, while the quantity has been sufficient, the quality has been very unsatis-factory. Further, the adverse United States exchange adds 6d. to 7d. per lb. to theretail price.[2320] B 2
The conditions of the world market and the Governments bacon policy havecombined to discourage the British farmer, and our pig population has fallen byone-third, with adverse effects on the supply of manure, and therefore on productiongenerally. In Ireland, on the other hand, where pigs are fed on maize and noton barley, the number of pigs has increased under control by 40 per cent, in thecurrent year.The Treasury base their opposition to the continuance of control on the groundthat there is no real shortage of supply, and that in the present serious exchangeposition the Government cannot go on providing unlimited supplies obtained chiefly fromthe United States. The Food Ministry resist the de-control of imported bacon pendingthe establishment of alternative sources of supply. The supply of pigs does, it is true,quickly respond to variations in price, nevertheless there cannot be any material changeunder twelve months. The necessary stimulus is already being applied to the Danishmarket, where a good quality of bacon will presently be obtainable. The FoodController was willing that home bacon should be freed and allowed to fetch its ownprice. Customers would doubtless complain of the difficulty of distinguishing the bestimported and the home article. Pending complete de-control, and in its place, the FoodMinistry are in favour of gradually substituting a system of collective trade buying withGovernment supervision of prices and distribution.The representative of the Irish Board was opposed to de-control, as it Was feared itwould lead to a dangerous export of pigs to England to secure the high prices, and theIrish might even be tempted to part with their breeding pigs.The Committee decided (a.) To recommend the Cabinet to authorise the de-control of home bacon, subjectto the administrative difficulties being satisfactorily adjusted by theDepartments concerned.(b.) To continue the control of imported bacon pending the establishment of analternative source of supply.The Chancellor of the Exchequer accepted this conclusion subject to the provisothat the pressure of the Exchange position might become so great as to force theGovernment to withdraw the obligation to supply an unlimited ration.VII. De-Control of Eome-Grown Meat.The Cabinet on the 4th February (Cabinet 8 (20), Conclusion 4) decided that, ifadministratively feasible, meat should be de-controlled in England, but that controlshould be retained in Scotland and Ireland, and they requested the Food Controller toexamine the administrative aspects of the problem.The Committee had before them the considered views of the Food Controller andhis advisers. In their opinion the proposed solution would lead to such chaos, financialloss, and discontent as to create a demand for the reimposition of control throughoutthe United Kingdom which the Government would find it hard to resist (C.P.-587).-The main difficulties would arise in dealing with the exportable surplus from Scotlandand Ireland.The Committee endorsed the views of the Ministry of Food, with the exception ofthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, who wished his dissent to berecorded.VIII. De-Control of Imported Meat.The attention of the Committee was called to the decision of the Cabinet tode-control imported meat and to terminate the present system by which the Ministryof Food acts as intermediary between the Board of Trade and the wholesalers (CabinetConference, December 9th, 1919, Minute 1). It was alleged that this decision, sofar as it affected the Ministry of Food, was not being carried out, and that there wasnot in fact a free circulation of meat. As a result stocks were accumulated at theports and heavy costs for demurrage incurred, with the prospect of some of the meatbecoming unfit for consumption. On behalf of the Ministry of Food it was explainedthat the Cabinet decision had been interpreted as not overriding certain runningcontracts and as not affecting stocks which were already in the hands of the Ministryat the time of the decision.
The Food Controller undertook to examine the matter, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, with a view to giving effect to the Cabinetfsdecision, and a suggestion made by the Shipping Controller that, so far aspossible, priority should be given to the discharge of ships in dock overreleases from the warehouses was referred to the President of the Board ofTrade.IX. Wheat Production in the United Kingdom.In discussing the bread subsidy, the Committee were led to consider a memorandumcirculated to the Cabinet by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries dealing with thefuture of wheat production in the United Kingdom (C.P.-589). Lord Lee directs theattention of his colleagues to the fall in the acreage of home-grown wheat of 400,000acres since 1918, and to the urgent importance in the national interest of arresting thisdecline. He contends that the present policy of the Government Wheat Control,which involves paying the farmer 76/- per quarter for home-grown and from 50 percent,to 75 per cent, more than this for foreign wheat, is a cause of deep dissatisfaction tothe farmers who are driven to grow uncontrolled cereals which they find relatively-more profitable than wheat. Further, the cost of wheat production is rising and thepresent small margin of profit at the Government price of 76/- is approaching vanishingpoint, and will entirely disappear if the demands of the labourers, now before theAgricultural Wages Board, are conceded. An appeal to the pockets and the patriotismof the farmers should, be made at once in order to secure the maximum sowing ofspring wheat. Lord Lee&apos;s specific remedies are : (l) a system of statutory guaranteedminimum prices, and (2) an immediate promise of a free market for the crop of 1920and succeeding years up to a maximum price of 100/- a quarter. If some such proposalswere not adopted the decline in arable cultivation would go on to the peril of the State,and would unfavourably react on the bread subsidy by driving the Government to buyin growingly expensive markets. Lord Lee reminded the Committee of the passage inthe King&apos;s Speech in which measures to stimulate and develop the home production ofessential foodstuffs had been definitely promised. &quot; -The proposals of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries raise large questions ofagricultural policy which, the Committee cannot pretend to have examined in all theirbearings, but it is desirable that the Cabinet should have before them the considerationswhich made the Committee hesitate to adopt Lord Lee&apos;s plan of a maximum price.We have not in recent times produced in the United Kingdom one-fourth of thewheat we consume, and the extraordinary measures taken during the war to developtillage have hot added more than eighteen days&apos; supply to the annual average crop ofthe five years before the war.* The current crop (1919-1920) will yield about17 per cent, of our consumption. In the opinion of some experts it is desirable thatsome of the least suitable land forced to grow cereals during the war should revert tograss. If we look to the world market, the conditions are such that it is impossible tocontemplate the termination of the control exercised by the Wheat Commission for someconsiderable time to come. The Wheat Commission must continue for the present tobe the sole buyer of home-grown wheat of millable quality and the prohibition of exportmust remain. There would therefore be no free market, and experience has shownthat Lord Lee&apos;s proposal would mean, in effect, the payment at once of 100s. insteadof 76s. a quarter to the farmer, or a subsidy of about  8 millions. Over against thismust be placed the higher foreign price which we may be forced to pay if the declinein the home wheat area continues and the present unfavourable rate of exchange isnot corrected. It is the conviction of some members of the Committee that the declinein wheat-growing is not primarily a matter of price, but is due to the inherent difficultyof the crop and especially to the scarcity of skilled labour.Assuming that a higher figure is to be fixed, the question was raised in theCommittee as to when it would be desirable that an announcement of this higher figureshould be made. Lord Lee pressed strongly for an immediate, announcement on theground that even a short delay would involve the loss of the spring sowings ; indeed,it is by no means clear that the farmer has not already made up his mind as to hisagrarian policy in the coming year and whether the announcement would not, therefore,* The figures for the quinquennial period of the war as compared with those for the quinquennial periodpreceding the war are Additional, Days&apos; Supply.1914-15.        1915-16.        1916-17 1917-18.        1918-19        1919-20.2 12 1 27 37 10
be too late to affect the amount of land under arable in the year 1920. On the other&quot;hand, if the price of many important commodities is to be raised, it was held that anunfortunate impression would be created by an announcement that the farmer wrould,at the same time, be obtaining more for his wheat, and it was urged by Sir RobertHome that, from the point of view of, the labour situation, everything was to be gainedby delaying the announcement.There is, however, a larger question to be considered. Is it, or is it not desirable orpossible to encourage the wheat area of the country by means such as those suggestedby the Minister of Agriculture ? We have to remember that, in spite of the greatefforts put out during the war, the increase in the arable area of the country wascomparatively slight. Even in 1918-19, when, with the utmost exertions and thegreatest possible encouragement from the State, thirty-seven days&apos; additional wheatsupply was obtained in this country, the country was still dependent for more thanthree-quarters of its necessary supplies upon imports from abroad. The moral seems tobe that, even under favourable circumstances, the amount capable of being added to thearable area of the country is comparatively insignificant, and the evidence tendered tothe recent Royal Commission shows that a great deal of land was taken under arableduring the war which was unfit for arable, and which has been reconverted into grass.Is there not strong reason for thinking that the British fanner is the best judge of thepolicy which he should pursue; that if he has elected for barley as against wheat, orfor grass as against barley, it is because the course which he has chosen is more profitableto him ? But&apos; even assuming that it is desirable to give encouragement to wheat-growing,can it be assumed that the kind of figure which the Wheat Commission is likely to pay(a figure which will certainly be below 100/-) will produce the effect required ? It is atleast very doubtful.In any case is it desirable that the Government at this stage should commit itselfto* securing to the farmer a price much above the price now offered by the WheatCommission ? It must be remembered that the majority on the Royal Commissionrecently appointed to inquire into agriculture recommended 68/- as a romunorativ^pricefor wheat-growing, and it would be very difficult, in face of this recommendationcontained in a public document widely circulated, to suggest a price much in advance ofthat figure. Also it should be remembered that, although at the present rate of exchangethe prices of American, Canadian, and Plate wheat are very high, a bumper harvest inAmerica, coupled with an improvement in the American exchange such as is not unlikelyto occur in the course of the summer, would entirely change the situation. There is noreason why, under favourable circumstances, wheat should not be selling this time nextyear at something like 80/- in the home market, and if this should prove to be the case,,and the British farmer were guaranteed a price in excess of that bid for American orCanadian wheat, the Government would be placed in a serious difficulty.To sum up, the general attitude of the Committee towards Lord Lee&apos;s proposalmay be put somewhat as follows : The Committee think it desirable to encourage thegrowing of wheat in the national interest and in order to encourage the farmer. Thereis a strong case for examining the price of 76/- now being paid by the WheatCommission in view of the changes in the cost of production since that figure wasadopted in the autumn of 1918. &apos;A new figure could only be fixed after carefulinvestigation of the changes in cost and of how far any of these were anticipated when76/- was selected. Regard should be had to the disability from which the farmers-suffered owing to the existence of the control. The Committee were also impressed bythe argument that there would be an increase in labour discontent if a higher pricewere given to the farmer simultaneously with the Government decision to put up the^price of bread and other foods.The Committee requested Lord Lee, Mr. Munro, Mr. Roberts, and Lord Crawford (a.) To ascertain, so far as possible, the changes in the cost of wheat production.since August 1918, so as to arrive at a fair equivalent price to-day to 76s.(b.) To furnish figures showing the comparative cultivation and prices of wheat,.barley, and oats.The Future of Food Control.The powers of the Ministry of Food lapse in August 1920. It became clear to-the Committee as they examined the position of the various commodities now underthe control of the Ministry of Food, that it is at present impossible to predict far inadvance the course of the world&apos;s food supplies.   Gratifying changes in the standard.
of living of nations are in process. For example, there is evidence that the Chineseare moving from a rice, and the negroes from a maize, to a wheat basis. The worlddemand for wheat is increasing enormously. Confronted with the prospect of ashortage in essential foodstuffs, it is the opinion,of the Committee that control insome form and to some degree must continue. This is emphatically the view ofMr. Roberts and his advisers. They ask, therefore, that some definite term of life,say three or five years, should be assigned to the Ministry, or to such part of itsorganisation as it is deemed desirable to retain. Mr. Roberts urged upon us withmuch force that the retention of some such machinery was a valuable prophylacticagainst social unrest. Changes in the habits of the people were proceeding rapidly inthe years immediately before the war, and had been expedited by the war, and somemeasure of discontent was inevitable, but it would be lessened by the knowledge thatthere existed a public Department charged with the task of smoothing out the violentfluctuations of the market. Some definite lease of life was essential if the services ofhe present unestablished officers of the Ministry were to be retained, and they wouldhave to be paid adequate salaries. The Ministry of Food and the Wheat and SugarCommissions were finding it extremely difficult to persuade men to remain with them,who had given long and unselfish service, and were now being tempted away byattractive opportunities in outside business. In the Wheat Commission, which hadrepresentatives in many parts of the world, only 1 per cent, of the staff were civilservants. Mr. Roberts made it clear that he did not advocate for peace time the rigidcontrols exercised in the war.. In his view, the aim should be to encourage associationsof traders and to induce them to regulate their profits not by the demands of themarket but by considerations of public interest. In order to do this there must be inthe background a Department of State armed with plenary powers which can be used ifnecessary.The Committee were agreed that a considerable measure and variety of controlmust continue for the present, and decided to appoint the following Sub-Committee to consider, in the light of the discussion which had taken place,what parts of the present organisation could be dispensed with, how theremaining sections should be organised, and what legislative powers wrould berequired and for what period: The Food Controller.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Secretary for Scotland.The Chairman of the Wheat Commission.The Chairman of the Sugar Commission.Mr. Upcott, Treasury.Mr. Pembroke Wicks, Secretary.H.
