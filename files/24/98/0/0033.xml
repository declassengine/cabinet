lit)1. The practice followed hy Government Departments duringt*2 i War of issuing documents to the Kress marked for publicationnot before a certain date should, as a general rule, cease,2,     An exception should usually be made in the case oflong and detailed official documents or communiques (which arenot Parliamentary Papers) particularly those containing a massof figures which cannot readily be telegraphed.   In theseexceptional cases each of the copies supplied to the Press shouldbe clearly marked that publication must not take place until acertain date and time.Usually the document or documents should be issued soas to reach the newspaper offices by 10 a,Mo on the morningpreceding the date of publication.3,    In these exceptional cases where long documents of theclass referred to in 2, are issued in advance to the Press, theyare to be issued to &quot;the whole Press without preference, nopriority being given to any newspaper or group of newspapers,4.    The responsibility for giving documents of the classreferred to in 2, to the Press rests with the Government Depart-raents concerned.5.    Every endeavour must be made by the Government Depart-ments concerned to deliver the document or documents early inthe day and, if possible, advi3 3 the newspapers the day before,by post or telephone, that the document or documents will beavailable the following morning3   It is necessary to providethe newspapers with copies as early as possible in the morningsince in the case of the Provincial Press the news has to betelegraphed to the country,6,    The procedure in regard to the distribution of Parlia- -mentary Papers will remain as it stands at prese,t. such dis-tribution being made, by the Stationery Office.   It Is a breach:of privilege of Parliament to give any copies of ParliamentaryPapers to the Press or to any persons whatsoever befors copieshave been made available to members of both Houses in the caseof Command Papers, or to Peers or to M8Ps,, In the case ofHouse of Lords or House of Commons Papers respectively.
114Copy of letter dated 4th February, 1920, from Sir M.P.A.Hankey to Dr. Addison.Dear Dr. Addison)Issue of Official and Parliamentary Paperato the Press.On January 14th you wrote to Mr. Chamberlainwho waspresiding at the Cabinet that day, pressing for the insertionof the following words ai the end of p?^a,3 of the Draft Instruct-ions to Government Departments (Paper 0.^.387)TJPsK*vided that technical and professional paperspublished otherwise than daily may, at the discretionof the Department concerned, receive such documents forconsideration, though not for publication or comment,In advance of the lay Press.&quot;At the Cabinet on January 21st the following decisionwas reached i-&quot;The Cabinet approved the Draft Instructions whichhad been prepared, subject to Sir Maurice Hankiey makingsatisfactory arrangements with Lord Rlddell cn the questionof communications to technical journals&quot;.I have now seen Lord Rlddell.   He is however quite unableto accept the proposed addition to paragraph 3 of the Instructions.He says that the Newspaper Proprietors Association will neveragree to the proviso, and that, if the Cabinet insist on prefer-ential treatment, the same trouble - the main one Indeed - whichtho Association desire to have eradicated will still exist.Lord Riddell says that the &quot;Times&quot; and other dailynewspapers will regard this special treatment as a stigma onthemselves.   They have their technical and professional eXpertson all subjects.   If Departments have the right to make exceptions.there will, he says, be no check on preferential treatment andthough the practice of preferential treatment may have obtainedfor a long time past, It has been responsible fer a great dealof trouble.inI shall be glad to know If/the ciroumstances you stillwish to press for your proposed addition to para. 3 of the DraftInstructions ?Yours sincerely,(Sgd)   M.P.A. HANKEY.Copy of a letter dated 12th February. 1920, from Dr. Addisonto Sir Maurice Hankey.Dear Hankey,Many thanks for your letter of the 4th February on thesubject of the proposed instructions as to the issue of Officialand Parliamentary Papers to the Press.You tell me that Lord Riddell, on behalf of theNewspaper Proprietors Association, &quot;is quite unable to accept&quot;the proposal 1 hich met w,ith general agreement at the CabinetMeeting
Meeting on the 21st January, that Departments should retaina discretion to send long and detailed documents to technicalfind professional papers, published otherwise than daily, forconsideration, though not for publication or comment, inadvance of the lay/press *In the&apos;last paragraph but one of   your letter youmention two arguments which pre urged by Lord Riddell insupport of his views...:. .    ;The first argument is that &quot;The Times&quot; and otherdaily newspapers would regard the continuance -of the existingprocedure of my and ether Departments&apos; in this respect &quot;as astigma on themselves&quot;, for the reason that they have their  , .technical and professional experts on all. subjects.   ..:I,a.m&apos;. -afraid that this is an argument that I cannot possibly, accept.What I have to consider is whether, it is my duty to make , ,&apos;.special arrangements for the purpose of affording full andaccurate information to the medical profession and othersabout important and ,often complex matters with,which the .. .Ministry of Health deals.     It Is perfectly clear to me, as amedical 7nan, that the members of my profession do not in factdepend upon daily newspapers for. explanations of long and.detailed official documents, such as are alone in question,issued by the Ministry..:. They do,, on the other hand, certainlydepend upon the established professional journals, such asthe&apos; &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and &quot;The Lancet&quot;, which comeout weekly and can afford to devote to &quot;the documents of whichI am speaking an amount of study and&apos; an amount of space whichcould not possibly be given, to them by,a daily newspaper. .I fail to see any reason why the medical professionshould be deprived of the valuable help- which their, journalscan give them if&apos;they are allowed sufficient,time to digest&quot;important documents and to express detailed, views upon them.?Lord Riddell&apos;s second argument is that if .anyexceptions are made to the rules which he suggests, &quot;therewill ... *be no check on preferential treatment&quot;.   I cannotaccept this as an accurate statement of the effect of the :&apos;practice which secured general support in the. Cabinet on thelast occasion on which it was discussedt    As I have alreadypointed out,- only long and detailed documents need be sentout to any papers in advance of the date on which it isproposed to publish thorn-,     It is now agreed that even this&apos;-&apos;restricted class of document should be sent in priority onlyto technical and professional papers;   and It is further agreedthat the precautions which this Department&apos;has always takento prevent premature publication of documents so sent out -should be maintained^.These limitations are perfectly intelligible to-all Departments, and I see no&apos;reason to anticipate that any ,Department would wish to transgress them.May I add that, although I happened to make thesuggestion that I should be allowed to maintain the existingpractice in the Ministry of Health, the retention of a similardiscretion was obviously&apos;felt to&apos; be&apos;Important by other Ministersat the Cabinet?   I therefore think that they, as well as myself,should be consulted before any undertaking is given that sucha discretion will not be retained.-:Yours sincerely,(Sd.) Christopher Addison*
