SECRET.    , * 3the cabinet.vW*4 -----iNDING OVER OP GERMAN WAR CRIMINALS.^Cfi^pttEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to my colleagues the attached Report from Major-General Hon.Sir F. R. Bingham, K.C.M.G., C.B., Chief of the British Section of the Inter AlliedMilitary Commission of Control, Berlin, on the situation caused by the publication inthe German Press of lists of German officers and officials to be handed over to theAllies.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The Wae Office,12th February, 1920.01545011Risport feom Ma job,-General Hon. Sir F. R. Bingham, K.C.M.G., C.B., Berlin,to the Director of Military Intelligence, War Office.Although the Charge d&apos;Affaires, Berlin, has telegraphed very fully to the ForeignOffice his opinion on the present crisis, the situation is so serious, that I am writingto you my views on the same subject which I hope you will place before Mr.Churchill if you think fit.The lists of officers and others to be handed over were published in the Germanpapers yesterday morning and the feeling on the subject is very intense. In myopinion, it has done more to re-unite the whole of the Parties in Germany thananything else could possibly have done. The inclusion of the names of Hindenburg,Ludendorff and other Army Commanders, has raised the feeling to such an extentthat it is impossible to say what may happen in the next few days. The presentGovernment in Germany certainly would not dare to hand these officers over, and evenif they wished, they have not the means of doing so. I may add that the list includesthe names of six or seven dead men.The work of the Commission of Control is already so seriously affected bv thestate of feeling that, as far as I can see, we can do nothing. Until yesterday we weregetting on extremely well, both with the Military Authorities and heads of firms. Noobstacle had been placed in our way. In fact, the authorities, Civil and Military, weredoing their best to help us to carry out the work. Since noon yesterday the wholeatmosphere is changed. The officers are unable to meet us to discuss any questions,and important men, whose factories were in hand, have new written asking that thework on them should be postponed,I can see no likelihood of resumption of negotiations until great concessions havebeen made.Herr Noske has issued a very strong appeal in the newspapers asking the people tokeep quiet and on no account to interfere with or molest the Entente officers of thevarious Missions. The man in the street appears to be calm, but political and betterinformed circles are seething.With a British Charge d&apos;Affaires here, it is not my business to write on politicalquestions, but as Chief of the British Section of the Commission of Control, I feel it myduty to write and inform you, and through you, the Secretary of State for War, of theseriousness of the case.I understand from Lord Kilmarnock that certain concessions have been agreedupon, but he is not acquainted with their details.( 1 I must repeat that I am of opinion that if the principle of asking for the surrenderof these officers to be tried by the Entente is insisted on, the work of disarmament ofGermany and the reduction of its army, will become an impossibility. Moreover, veryreliable information is to hand that an insistence on the terms of surrender willeventuate in Germany&apos;s acceptance of Soviet Russia&apos;s invitation to join hands.F. R. Bingham, Major-General,Berlin, Chief of British Section,Uh February, 1920. Commission of Control.(B20/94)   100  2/20  H&amp;S  7944wo
