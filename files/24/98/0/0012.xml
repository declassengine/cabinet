(THIS DOCUMENT is the PROPERTY OF HIS BHITA1TFIC MAJESTY1S GOVESECRET. CABINET.C.P,612,        PERSONS OF ALIEN EXTRACTION IN THE CIVIL SERVICE,is^\     Memorandum by the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury., 6P 1*     On May 8th, 1919 the HomeHcA.C.27.Minute 2.     Affairs Committee decided the following rule for futureentrants Into the Government Service:-(a) A candidate must be a natural born BritishSubject and the son (or daughter) of a fatheralso a natural born British Subject.* -(b) The Foreign Office should, if they so prefer,retain their existing rule that a candidatefor the Foreign Office must be a natural-bornBritish subject and born within the UnitedKingdom or In one of the self-governingDominions, of parents also born within theseterritories, except when special permission Isgiven to the Civil Service Commissioners by theSecretary&apos;of State for Foreign Affairs.(c) So far as open competitions are concerned, thenew rule&apos;to be laid down in the general-regulations of tho Civil Service Commissioners,(d) Heads of Departments, in oursuance of thegeneral deoiaion^ to apply the rulesadministratively to cases of appointments madenot by open competition, but either by directnomination or by limited competition amongnominated candidates.
2*     On July 18th the followingadditional decisions were taken:-(a) That the new nationality rule should beamended to read as follows:-&quot;A candidate must be a natural born Britishsubject, and the son (or daughter) of afather also a natural born British subject;provided that exception to the latter conditionmay be made in the case of candidates who haveserved in His Majesty1a armed forces duringthe war&quot;..(b) &quot;That persons who, while not satisfying thenew rule, have in the past qualified (underthe Reconstruction regulations or otherwise)for established posts, should now becertificated and employed in their establishedposts on a distinct understanding that theirestablishment is subject, to any action whichmay be taken by the &quot;:rar Cabinet upon theReport of Lord Justice Bankes1 Committee(o)    That &quot;annexed subjects&quot; should not be exemptedfrom the operation of the new rule.It was-at the same time decided that personsnot of British or Allied parentage, in the permanentService of the Government throughout the War, should notbe dismissed on account of their parentage, and that thisshould apply also to the cases under 2 (b) above.
3,    There has now arisen a question to which theattention of the Home Affairs Committee has not yetbeen expressly called, viz:Whether a person of alien extraction vrho hasobtained admission in a certain capacity to the Service(established or unesta.blish.ed) but who does not satisfythe new nationality rule should or- should not bedebarred by the new rule from entering into another(and higher) grade?.The Minutes of the Home Affairs Committee statethat they approve of a new nationality rule for-futureentrants into the Government Service.-    But admission tothe Civil Service (in the widest sense) at the bottomdoes not at- present&apos; open the road to any and every higherpost without further teat,-1   and the question is will theHome Affairs Committee hold that, once a person of alienextraction has entered the Service in any capacity .invirtue.of the old rule, his extraction is no bar toprogress in any;direction, or should the new rule barhis progress at certain points?4.-.   Take first upper posts. -A man already in Class I (established) is promotedwithout any fresh certificate till it is a case of hisappointment to a post &quot;not in the ordinary course ofpromotion,&quot;.or of a transfer to another office, v In thelatter class of case the Civil Service Commissioners nowissue fresh certificates without regard to nationality.  &apos;It seems clear that the new rule does not apply to thesecases which are not those&quot; of&apos; &quot;new entrants to the Service&quot;.
The same holds good generally of superior anddirecting*or &quot;staff posts&quot;.In all such cases the only possible rule appearsto be &quot;once in, all follows&quot;.Taking then lower posts:5,     There are various grades e.g. Class Ij SecondDivision, Officers of Customs and Fxcise, which arerecruited by open competitive examinations, at yjhich personsalready in the Service (viz: Assistant Clerks, Boy Clerks)are allowed to sit under preferential conditions;   or6,     There are other large classes recruited bycompetition exclusively among persons already in theService e.g/ Assistant Clerks recruited from Boy Clerks,Supplementary Clerks recruited from subordinate PostOffice Sorting Clerks, Telegraphists, etc,, recruited fromLearners, etc, and7v     Finally; there are the Postmen and other similarclasses in the industrial Departments and the OrdnanceSurvey who are nominated for establishment after so manyyears unestablished service.Now as regards the lower end,- the transition from unestablished Postmento       established &apos;   &quot;wr through the various grades ofBo:y Clerk - Post Office LearnerAssistant Clerk TelegraphistSecond Division Clerk    Supplementary ClerkIntermediateup to Class I is a perfectly definite step requiring
issue of a formal certificate and it would be possibleto interpose at any stage the new nationality rule,so as to stop the progress o.f persons of alienextraction who have already got a footing at thebottom,,8..     But,  (a) certain of the men (e.g. Boy Clerks andLearners in the Post Office) have definite rights ofproceeding to examinations for higher posts.     The BoyClerk class exists only as a reservoir for the AssistantClerks1 class.such a bar among the lower grades, if (as is thought Itmust) the rule &quot;once in, all follows&quot; applies to Class Iand other directing posts in which there is perhaps thegreatest opportunity of mischief,      -9.     In these circumstances the Treasury is preparedto recommend that an exception should be made in the generalregulations for open competition in favour of personsalready certificated by the Civil Service Commission,and inthe Regulations for the various limited competitions infavour of persons appointed to posts leading in the normalcourse to certification before the new nationality rulebecame operative.10,   The exact wording of the latter exceptionwould need to be considered with the Civil ServiceCommission;   the phrasing might be (as in the Order inCouncil of March 1918) persons &quot;serving in an unestablishedposition which leads in the normal course to establishment&quot;.(b) The Government can hardly justify erecting(Initialled)S.B.February 12th 1920.
