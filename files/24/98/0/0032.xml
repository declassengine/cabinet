This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.FIDENTiAL.THE CABINET.ALL b^V&quot;THE PRESENT SITUATION INS GERMANY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Memorandum by the-General Staff which I hope my colleagues mayfind time to read.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Uth February, 1920.Present Situation in Germany.1. During the past 15 months the greater part of the machinery for the acquisitionof information in Germany has been of a military character. General Malcolm, whohas been in Germany for 9 months, has shown sound judgment and made good use ofhis position, which has brought him into contact not only with the German Governmentbut with many of the important personalities outside the Government.Much valuable information has been furnished also by the Army of the Rhine,by the Armistice Commission under Lieut.-General Haking, and by special agents andofficers sent into Germany. All this information has been collated and carefully siftedby the section of the General Staff dealing with Germany, in consultation with thePolitical Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office.It follows that the General Staff are in a peculiarly favourable position to gaugethe present situation in Germany, and desire to draw the attention of the BritishGovernment to certain matters of. special and urgent importance, some of which areoutside the scope of their normal functions and would not have been referred to hadthe ordinary diplomatic services of information been at the disposal of the ForeignOffice.2. In the early part of 1919, the preservation of order in Germany was a task ofthe gravest difficulty, which seemed almost beyond the power of the authorities.Officers hardly dared to show themselves. Soldiers&apos; Councils existed all over thecountry, and most of the troops had lost all discipline and cohesion. Yet the positiongradually improved, thanks to&apos;the supply of food to Germany (mainly at. the instanceof the British), and to Noske&apos;s firmness.In May and June a fresh crisis was caused by the unexpectedly hard nature of thepeace terms, and the Government again had the utmost difficulty in maintaining itsposition, and was only saved by Erzberger&apos;s adroitness. Since then the long delaybefore ratification has had a bad effect, and although the situation in Germany hasimproved in some respects, it is endangered and aggravated by the intrigues of thePrussian Military and Junker Party, led by such men as Ludendorff and Hoffmann,by the Bolshevik successes in Russia, and the machinations of the Extreme Left Partyin Germany, and by the troubles and unrest in Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, and otherparts of Europe and the world in general.3. There are at least three questions of extreme importance and urgency, andif we are to avoid chaos in Europe, they should, in the opinion of the General Staff, bedealt with without delay.These questions are :--(a.) The strength of the armed forces allowed to Germany under the PeaceTreaty.(6.) The economic condition of Germany.(c.) The delivery of the War Criminals for trial by the Entente Powers.4. The German Government, which is composed of the three great moderateparties in Germany, has had to contend with great difficulties, and has held its own ina way which seemed almost impossible 6 to 9 months ago. It is by no means anideal Government, but the General Staff believe its alternative is either the return to(B20/98)   J.00  2/20  H&amp;S   7948wo
a reactionary rule under the Military Party and Military Junker Class, or thedominance of the Extreme Left, who have identified themselves with RussianBolshevism. Whereas the set policy of the present Government appears to be tocarry out the terms of the Peace Treaty, hopeless of fulfilment as they consider manyof the conditions to be, the avowed intention of)both the Extreme Right and ExtremeLeft Parties is lo upset the Treaty, in one case by armed force, in the other by worldrevolution and Bolshevism. Both the extreme parties desire to secure Russian co-operation ; the Military Party appears to be working for the ultimate overthrow of theRussian Bolshevik Government by means of the Red Army, which is becoming more^and more permeated by German influence; the Extreme Left Party are in close touchwith Moscow, and their ultimate goal is world revolution, by which they hope todestroy the Treaty of Versailles.It is, therefore, of great importance to maintain the present Government in officeand to strengthen its position. For this it is essential that the Government shouldhave a force of troops and police at its disposal, sufficient to ensure the maintenance oforder throughout the.country. Recent events have shown that Noske has a firm gripof the situation, but it seems impossible for this control to continue if the armed forcesof Germany are reduced to 100,000 men by the 1st April, 1920.5. Under Article 160 of the Peace Treaty, the military establishment must bereduced to 100,000 by the 31st March, 1920. Article 163 allows Germany to effect agradual reduction to 200,000 by a date within three months from the coming into forceof the Peace Treaty, i.e. by the 10th April, 1920. It has not yet been decided whichof these clauses is to hold good. At present the Reichswehr, Germany&apos;s Regular Army,is believed to amount to about 300,000 to 350,000 men, including demobilization staffsand guards for Russian prisoners of war, but is in process of reduction to 200,000.Owing to the general insecurity which prevailed in Germany during 1919, severalsemi-military organizations have been formed, of which the following are the mostimportant: Strength.Einwohnerwehr (Civic Guards).........   300,000-400,000ZeitjfreiwUMgen (Reichswehr Reserves)  ...      ...   150,000-200,000Technische Nothilfe (Technical Volunteers) ... 30,000-50,000Sicherheitspolizei (Armed Constabulary)...&apos;      ...      40,000-60,000All these organizations are under the Ministry of the Interior, and their members,except the SicherheiUpolizei, are men carrying on their civilian occupations, who areliable to be called out in case of local disturbances. The Einwohnenvehr andZeitfreiwilligen are organized in companies, and armed with rifles, and in some caseswith machine guns. The Technische Nothilfe are men of special technical knowledge,who would, in the case of a general strike or other disturbances, be available to assistin working the railways, post and telegraph offices, electrical services, &amp;c.The Sicherheitspolizei consist of a body of picked men, armed with rifles, machineguns and trench mortars, and supplied with artillery and aeroplanes. The raison oVetreof this force is the maintenance of order, especially in large towns, where it is mainlyconcentrated, the principal object being to obviate the necessity of calling upon theregular troops to deal with internal disturbances. The personnel of the Sicherhcits-polizei are specially trained for fighting in towns, and wear a uniform similar to that ofthe Reichswehr.Although the Einwohnerwehr and Zeitfreiwilligen owe their formation to a realneed, and although, in view of the war-weariness of the German people and theshortage of transport, rolling stock, petrol, rubber, &amp;c, they constitute no immediateperil to the Entente, their continued existence may be a serious danger in the future,and the General Staff consider that they should be abolished with the least possibledelay.On the other hand, it is held that the German Government cannot with safetyreduce the strength of their Regular Army below 200,000 men in the near future,whilst they require a small, compact body of efficient police, surplus to their Gendar-inerie, to maintain order in the large towns.6. Nearly a year ago, the situation in Germany had become extremely dangerousowing to shortage of food, and it was mainly due to British efforts, especially those ofthe War Office, who were in possession of accurate information regarding the state ofaffairs in Germany, that the Supreme Council were induced to allow food supplies to besent into Germany, thus averting what might have been a terrible catastrophe.
IlOAlthough the present position in Germany is in some ways better than in theearlier part of 1919, elements of serious danger remain, increased by the unrest andtroubles which exist in Europe. The serious rise in the price of all commodities, thealarming deterioration of German currency and the apparent hopelessness of the future,have created a situation which has again become perilous, and will be intensified by theserious shortage of food in Germany.General Malcolm, backed &apos;by many reports from independent sources, predicts,unless help is given, a gradual development of this situation until Germany reaches aposition similar to that of Austria.Austria has hitherto escaped a violent revolution, but this must be put down tothe peculiar character of her people, and we cannot safely draw the analogy that theGerman people will remain quiescent when conditions approach those which exist inAustria to-day.Far from receiving any reparation from Austria we shall probably for years tocome be obliged to spend money in feeding her people, and if we are not careful itappears to the General Staff to be probable that we shall have to do the same forGermany unless her economic situation is improved.Such a condition of affairs does not augur well for the fulfilment of Germany&apos;svast liabilities in the Peace Treaty, which included the following financial and economicobligations: (1.) Repayment of cost of Armies of Occupation, Commissions of Control, &amp;c.(2.) Restrictions re Customs Charges on imports, &amp;c.(3.) Payment of 20,000 million gold marks (1,000 million pounds) by 30th April,1921.(4.) Repayme?it, with interest, of sums exacted as levies in France and Belgium.(5.) Compensation for all damage to civilian property of the Allied Powers.(6.) Complete restoration of Belgium.(7.) Schedule of payment, fixed by Reparations Commission, to continue for30 years from 1st May, 1921.   (In Paris it was hoped that these paymentswould amount to 6,000 million pounds.)(8.) In addition, large amounts of coal are to be handed over to the Allies; aconsiderable portion of Germany&apos;s floating docks is to be surrendered ; the&apos; shipping clauses provide for a ton per ton replacement of all Allied shippingsunk, &amp;c.For the military reason, therefore, that it is essential to avoid a Bolshevikupheaval in Germany, and, as it appears to the General Staff, in. the materialinterests of this country and of the Allied Powers, it is essential that some means, suchas a loan, supply of raw material, or other devices, should be taken by the AlliedPowers to assist Germany in restoring her economic position without delay.7. The impending demand for the surrender of war criminals is at present causingserious preoccupation to the German Government. The German people regard thisclause of the Treaty as totally unjust, and as a condition the fulfilment of which willcast lasting discredit on them.In Berlin last month, General von Liittwitz, General Officer Commanding variousArmy Corps during the war, and now General Officer Commanding the troops in theBerlin district, said in conversation that he understood his name had been placed onthe list, and he was not sure whether it had since been removed or not; in any case,however, he had no intention of surrendering or of allowing himself to be taken. Hepresumably meant that he would commit suicide rather than be handed over to theAllies.There is no doubt that the German Government will have the utmost difficulty inenforcing compliance with the Allied demand for the surrender of the war criminals fortrial by an Allied Court; it is almost certain that the troops and police will refuse toarrest the individuals in question, especially if the list is long and includes a number ofdistinguished soldiers and sailors. The result will almost inevitably be the fall of thepresent Government, and its replacement by a regime which is hardly likely to besatisfactory to us.8. The following proposal is made to solve the first question raised in paragraph 3 : Whilst insisting on the abolition of all semi-official or semi-military organi-zations, to allow Germany to retain, at all events for 1920, a force of 150,000to 200,000 Iteichswehr, and 40,000 to  60,000   Sicherheitspolizei,   for  the
maintenance of internal order and the control of the frontiers. The Inter-AlliedMilitary Commission of Control to report on the exact numbers that arerequired.With this alteration, all the military terms of the Peace Treaty to be carriedout rigidly.The surrender of guns, trench mortars, machine guns, rifles, aeroplanes,ammunition and military stores/ and the dismantling of arsenals, factories,,fortifications, &amp;c, should prove a sufficient guarantee of Germany&apos;s militaryimpotence.In addition, the General Staff venture, while realizing that the matters will beconsidered by departments other than the War Office, to make the following suggestionsfor dealing with the remaining two questions raised in paragraph 3 of this paper : (a.) To raise a loan for Germany and to supply her with raw material formanufacturing purposes; in return, receiving a large proportion of thefinished articles and taking over a share in some of &apos; the principalmanufacturing and financial concerns. Not to wait for Allied agreementto provide the money and raw material, but to make a start with Britishresources alone with the least possible delay.(6.) To modify the clauses (Articles 227 to 230) demanding the surrender of warcriminals for trial by Allied Tribunals. The trials should either be carriedout in German Courts, with Allied prosecutors, or by neutral courts. Testtrials could be arranged and carried through in Germany in order toestablish the intention of the Germans to act in good faith; if thesetrials were found unsatisfactory, execution of the original conditions of theTreaty would be demanded. If this suggestion presents serious legaldifficulties, it should be possible to devise other means of modifying theclause without real infringement of the terms of the Treaty.If it were considered absolutely necessary to demand the surrender tothe Allies of a certain number of war criminals, as a matter of principle andto act as a precedent and deterring factor in future wars, then this numbershould be cut clown to the lowest possible figure, say 6 or 12 men, who hadbeen guilty of appaling crimes against prisoners, women or children, or hadfired on people attempting to escape in boats or otherwise from ships thathad been sunk.9. The General Staff are of opinion that, in view of the Bolshevik menace inEastern Europe, the intrigues of the German Military and Junker Party in Russia, andthe situation in Central and1 South Eastern Europe, the re-establishment of normal andsettled conditions in Germany, is likely to be a determining factor in deciding the futureof the world. They consider that, unless early action be taken on the lines indicated,there is a serious danger of the overthrow of the present German Government, inwhich case we should be faced with two alternatives : (a.) Return to power of the Prussian Military and Junker Party, whose policywould be to oppose the execution of the terms of the Peace Treaty, byevery means in their power, possibly with the aid and co-operation ofRussia.. (b.) Chaos in Germany, spreading over the whole of Europe, in the event of theExtreme Left Party gaining the upper hand.General Staff,War Office,5th February, 1920.
