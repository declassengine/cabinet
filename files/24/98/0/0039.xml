HZkhis Document Is the property of Hie Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government).3S0.yfH. OA BIN E       .CP.-629. February 13, 1920.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; (Extradition of ths ^Smoeror,)(Ajporyrsd ffi the Supreme Oou&amp;cil on February 14. 1920*)fHe Powers have taken cognisance of the reply of the fletherlandDvernasfct to their Nets of January 15, 1920, regarding the handing over&amp; the&amp; for trial of William of Hohenaollern, German ex-Emperor.The immense sacrifices made in the general interest by the Powerstiring  the war, entitle them to asfc the Netherlands to re-consider aefuaal haded on the weighty but entirely personal considerations of atsate which has held aloof from the war and cannot, perhaps, appreciatenits accurately all the duties and daagers of the present hour.The obligations of the Powers towards other nations, the gravityf the question concerned, as well as the very grave political effectso whioh relinquishment of the claims of justice against the ex-Bmperorould give rise, all constrain them to uphold and to renew their demand.The Powers do not ask The Queenf s  overnaient to depart from itsraditional policy, but consider that the nature of their request - which&amp;ee not, in their opinion, depend solely or even mainly on Dutch Municl-a law - has not been adequately appreciated.tfo question of prestige is at stake and the Powers pay as much?ed to the conscientious sentiments of a State with limited interestsi to the mature decision of the Great Powers, but cannot wait for thefeeation of a world tribunal competent to examine international crimes,ifore bringing to trial the responsible author of the catastrophe of thereat war.It
V .  - 143It ie precisely this contemplated trial which wyruid prepare the wayfor such a tribunal and demonstrate the unanimity of feeling animating the conscience of the nations of the world.2he Pcwers wish to point out that the League of JJatiens has not yetreached a state of development sufficient to allow of any application toit, or to a tribunal of any kind created by it, meeting with that promptsatisfaction which is surely essential.  Would not the refusal of HerMajesty&apos;s Government to hand over the ex-Umperor, if persisted in, createan unfortunate precedent tending to render ineffective any proceedingstaJcen by an international tribunal against criminals &apos;in high places?3he Government of the Motherlands lays stress on the fact that therequest to hand over the ex-Emperor can only be regarded by it from thepoint of view of its own duty.   It doea not appear to consider that itshares with the other civilized Nations the duty of securing the punish-ment of crimes against justice and the principles of humanity, crimes forwhich William of Ethenjsollera undeniably bears a heavy responsibility.2he JJote of January 15th was sent in the name of all the Allies,26 in number, who were signatories of the Treaty of Peace, and the collect,ivs mandatories of the majority of the civilized nations of the world.It is impossible to disregard the collective force of this request,which is the expression not only of the feeling of indignation of thevictims, but of the demand for justice made by the conscience of humanityas a whole.2he Motherland Government has surely not forgotten that the policyand personal actions of the man required for judgment by the Powers havecost the lives of approximately ten million men, murdered in their prime,and been responsible for the mutilation or shattered health of threetimes as many, the laying waste and destruction of millions of squaremiles of territory in countries formerly industrious, peaaeablo and happy,and the piling up of war debts running into billions, the viotlms beingmen who had defended their freedom and incidentally that of Holland. 2heeconomic and social existence of all these nations has been thrown intoconfusion and is now jeopardised by famine and want, the terrible resultsof
I that mr of which William II was the author.II  3!he Allies cannot conceal their surprise at finding, in the Dutch reply,single word of disapproval of the crimes committed by the Emperor, crimesich outrage the most elementary sentiments of humanity and civilisation,4 of which, in particular, so many Dutch nationals have themselves beene innocent victims on the high seas,   $0 help to bring to justice thethor of such orimes - Crimes for which, in the words of Grctius, the cul-its are npuniendi aut dedendi aut certe amoYendi* (Book II, Chap.21, S.4)ainly accords with the aims of the League of Nations.How can any one fail to be impressed by the reactionary manifestationsich have followed the refusal of Holland, and the dangerous encouragementus given to all those who are opposing the just chastisement of the cul-its and their exemplary condemnation, whatever their social position?Holland, whose history tells of long struggles for liberty, and whos suffered so grievously th**ugh disregard of justice, could not placerself by such a narrow conception of her duties1, outside the comity oftions.fhe duty which none can avoid for national reasons, however weighty theyy be, is to unite in order to met&amp; out exemplary punishment &apos;to the respon-ble authors of the disa&amp;terrs and abominations of the war, and to endeavour1 revive conceptions of solidarity and humanity in the German nation, whichi still unconvinced of the falsity of the tenets of its Governments, who:of eased that Might v/as Right,, and that suocess condoned crime.It was from this point of view, and not exclusively from the nationaltandpoint, that the Powers requested the Government of the Queen to handrer William of Hohenzollern, and from this point of view they now renew that&amp;uest.$he Powers desire to remind the Government of the Motherland that ifk should persist in its attitude of detachment towards.....................
towards the presence of the Imperial family or its territory,so close to Germany, it would assume direct responsibilityboth for sheltering a criminal from the claims of justiceand for that propaganda which is so dangerous to Surope endthe whole world.   It is indisputable that the permanent pre-sence of the ex-Emperor, under fatally ineffectual supervision,at a few kilometres distance from the German frontier, wherehe continues to be the centre of active and increasing in-trigue, constitutes, for the Powers who have made superhumansacrifices to destroy this mortal danger, a menace whichthey cannot be callea upon to accept.   The rights theypossess in virtue of the most ezpresB principles of theLaw of Rations, entitle them, and make it their duty, totake such measures as ere required for their own security.The Powers cannot conceal the painful impression madeupon them by the refusal of the Dutch Government to handover the e -3mperor to them, without any consideration ofthe possibility of reconciling the scruples of Holland withsome effectual precautionary measures, to be taken eitheron the spot or by holding the ex-Emperor at a distance fromthe scene of his crimes, nicking it impossible for him toexert hie disastrous influence in Germany in the future. &apos;Although a proposal of this nature would not have correspondedfully to the request of the Powers, it would at least bsveafforded proof of those feelings which Holland cannot butpossess.The Powers urge upon the  utch Government in the mostsolemn and pressing manner the importance attaching to a freshconsideration of the question put before her.   They dec irethat it may be clearly understood how grave the situationmight become if the Motherland Government were not in aposition to give those assurances which the safety ofEurope bo imperatively demands.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.,. .,I4t&apos;h February 19
