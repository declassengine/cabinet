I (Thi3 Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government).CABINET,-ECRET. -BEACHISY SHIPYARDS AND SEVERN TIDAL POWER SCKHSffi.P,643.Memorandum hy the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The proposal referred to in the memorandum (CP.573) willcause serious concern to persons interested in salmon fisheries.     Interms of its output of salmon, the Severn   is   at the present day themost important salmon river in England and Wales.     Owing to a varietyof causes, of which the chief are obstructions in the river itself andexcessive netting, the river does not breed nearly so great a quantityof salmon as it should, and there is reason to suppose that a greatproportion of the salmon taken in the Severn district are in fact bredin the neighbouring River Wye.     The Severn salmon are taken almostentirely in tidal waters, that is to say, below Gloucester.     TheMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries have always regarded the RiverSevern as a river capable of great development.     Prima facie, aproject such as is described in the attached memorandum must beinimical to any such development.The works contemplated would presumably involve the erectionof a dam right across the Severn estuary, commencing on the westwardside somewhere near Beachley Point.     Presumably there would be sluicesin the dam, but it is doubtful whether the salmon would be able to usethem.     There would be lock gates for the passage of traffic, but thenumber of salmon which would pass the lock gate when used for traffic,Jl and probably full of traffic, is likely to be small.     Presumably itwould be possible to provide ladders, but, apart from the difficultyof construction, they would probably be    unsatisfactory owing to the
difficulty of so constructing them and placing them      as toattract the salmon to them.     In short, it is difficult toconceive means by which any scheme for harnessing the tidesof the Severn Estuary could be put into operation withoutruining the river as a salmon river, and depriving a&apos;largenumber of fishermen who use the tidal waters of the Severn oftheir livelihood,I observe that, in spite of the fact that evidencewas given on behalf of the Ministry before the Water vPower Resources Committee referring to the effect of water powerschemes on salmon fisheries (in the course of which thesuggestion of harnessing the tides of the Severn wasspecifically mentioned), no reference is made in the memorandum(CP, 573) to the fishery interests of, this important river.These interests certainly ought to be fully considered, 1although other considerations of greater importance mayultimately outweigh them.1L of F. f1I16. 2. 1920.
