There is. of course, no falling off inthe underground plotting of the internationalists, and the Rankand File Convention will show the fruits of the reoent conferenceof the Third International in Amsterdam.   Lenin haa said morethan once that he bases his hopes upon the Shop Steward Movementin England, as it approximates more closely than otherorganisations to the Soviet constitution.   There may, therefore,be a recrudescence of the movement that was so troublesome duringthe war.Indications are against an immediate coal strike.   Theminers1 leaders seem more likely to attempt to force a generalelection, sinoe they realise that a general strike before anelection would ruin the chanoes of Labour.   They seem likelyto complicate the issue by a demand for higher wages.In Newcastle there is a significant development:   theLabour Party is appointing full-time agents.There is much dissension in the Independent Labour Party:the quarrels of the extremist leaders, who are trying to foroeunon the party a Communist body, are naively advertised byAlbert Inkpin in the current issue of &quot;The Call&quot;,The Dutch Polioe broke up the Third International meetingin Amsterdam last week and the four British representatives,Sylvia Pankhurst, F. Willis, J.T. Murphy and J.F. Hodgson,all members of the British Sooialist Party, fled home toEngland without securing any funds.
KATIOKALISATIOft Off THE MIBES   .An immediate- strike is unlikely.   The special Trafi.esUnion Congress which will meet to decide what steps shallhe taken to &quot;compel&quot; the Government to adopt the SankeyMajority Report, has been fixed provisionally for March S5tlThe numerous reports which have been received allpoint to the same fact; the miners will strike, ifordered to do so by their leaders, but there will be nogeneral spontaneous movement from the rank and file,unless, as seems likely, the issue is complicated by a-demand, for increased wages.   Although Smillie end Hodgesare extremely reticent, there are indications that they. will exploit the demand for higher;wages, because they&apos;  know that a purely political cry will not obtain thenecessary backing.;, Mr * Smillie recently remarked thatMr.  unrigs speech in the House of Commons was a &quot;stupidoutburst&quot; and &quot;very injudicious&quot; and that Mr. Lunn andMr. Herbert Smith (President of the Yorkshire Miners1Association) still feel that the Miners&apos; Federation ofGreat Britain &quot;let them down&quot; during the Yorkshire strikeand are possibly advertising the fact that they do not. .agree with his tactics.Smillie and Hodges think that their propaganda hashad some effect in closing the minersT ranka, but theysay that, for the money spent, the effect on the generalpublic is &quot;heart-breaking&quot;.   They do not expect much helpfrom the othey members of tha Triple Alliance, unless coalstocks become esftausted.   All these remarks wore made ^tothree personal-friends and can therefore be accepted, asgenuine opinions.My correspondents report that local miners1 leadersappear to be surprisingly ignorant of the programme ofthe/
-   -the Federation officials.In view of the possibility that the Federation maytake a &quot;ballot of their members, interest attaches to tlproposal of one of my correspondents who has been a minand is intimately acquainted with Trade Union procedure,He suggests that in order to obtain a fair ballot, it wbe necessary:(l)    That the ballot should be conducted by anindependent authority, and counting andscrutinising done by people unconnected withthe industry, in order to avoid victimisation( )    That only names on the current wages sheetsat pits should be on the voters1 register,and that the register should be similar tothat used at elections, in order to avoidduplication.(3)   That there should be a penalty for impersonal(4) That unions should be informed that the resiilof the ballot will be ignored, unless 7*5$ ofthe total register record votes,&apos;as there arsmethods of preventing attendance,(5) That in order to prevent boys having the samevoting strength as hewers(a;   Boys under 21 to be barred from votiror(b)   Boy3 under 21 to vote on differentcolourod paper and their votes count half, buthat an exception be made in the case of boysover 18 who are working underground.(6) That there should be only one question, simpiworded and on one definite issue, on the papeFEELING IN THE NORTH WESTERN DISTRICTMy correspondent, who has made careful investigatein this district, sends the following report, whichindicates a decline in revolutionary feeling.The weather at this time of the year usually causesan average of about 4$ lower output per man, and about 1increase in bad time-keeping. Comparing actual figuredfor January and November In about a dozen trades in thesareas, time-keeping has improved on an average of 14-17/and/
.   - 3 -and output per individual 7-8$*   for these definite factsno reason can be given beyond that the men appear to besettling dovrn more quickly.   In the one or two casesfound that did not show an improvement some local influencewas responsible, such as a works dispute or friction withmanager.In public houses, labour clubs, and at footballmatches the general tone of the menTs conversations isless truculent than it used to be and the continualgrumbling noticeable in July of last year is not so common.Enquiries yield no confirmation of the, reports thatorganisations such as the Independent Labour Party, BritishSocialist Party or Socialist Labour Party,are gainingmembers as rapidly as during the earlier months of lastyear: membership seems to be praotically stationary sinceOctober last, except in Preston and Oldham, where there isa reduction on the year, and at Kelson, where there issome increase.The Irish movements are held together more bysentiment than anything else, but all other really extremebodies are without backing from the rank and file; theTrade Unions in these districts without exception take nointerest in Soviet agitators except to &quot;blacklist&quot; themand check their-proceedings.BAJ4ROW,   Time-keeping and output per individual in theengineering tarc&amp;e for tho same period is better, but about4$ lower thp-n cn the Clyde; considering the circumstancesthis figure is more satiefcotory than that of the Clyde,as it is likely to improve, whereas on the Clyde a dropis to be expected in a month or two.   Considering the numberof men employed and living and working in this small area,the feeling among the men when away from work is not bad.Wlgjjj.   The cotton industry is one of the few unaffected bythe ^limitation of output1 principle and, apart fromconsider
considerable unrest, which will probably come to a head inMarch when rates of pay are to beoreconsidered, the distritis quiet.   The local unrest, however, does not allowany fair figures to be- obtained regarding time-keeping.In the iron foundries casual inspection shows no declinein output from November last,OLDHAM is in the same position as V/igan; the unrest amongthe cotton operatives is preventing progress andencouraging extremists.RjBLSOS Is a centre of unrest but its influence appearspurely local and chiefly affects the miners, who show aslight reduction in hewers1 output; absenteeism is aboutthe same as in November.   This tends to prove thatextremists1 speeches do affect the actual working oftheir hearers. t .;PRESTOS.   The situation in&apos;&quot;the cotton industry is similar *to that in Wigan.. The improvement in percentage at thebrass foundries equals the Clyde figures.Discharged men are reported to be considerably quieterowing to changes in the officials of the nationalFederation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors andSoldiers, and only a small percentage remains unemployed.IMC HESTER,   unrest prevails in the Cotton industry;woollen and silk trades are also affected to some extent.For some obscure reason the Engineering industry isunsteady.   Percentages of work vary to suoh an extent thatit is impossible to quote reliable results of examinationof cost sheets; if anything there is a shade of improvementsince November, which dropped towards the first week inFebruary.The position ,in the. Chemical industry is good. Thereis again a satisfactory improvement  n the January figures,about 7$ increase in output and a steady rise. - -1 Both the public enquiry about the dockers&apos; wages and. , -  :; ml:
ana the congested state of the quays are combining to makethe dockers restless.   There is evidence of xgoing slow1which is probably due to local influence and to dislikeof individuals.   The actual &apos;turn round&apos; of a steamer now,(general cargo) working its own gear from all hatches onto a single quay is 68*4$ below pre-war speed in the caseof a 7,000 ton ship now in port.   It is difficult toascertain the average, but it is probably between 70-84$slower than before the war.LIVERPOOL.   The Dockers are not working too well but localinfluences again are the reason.   The Transport workersare generally affected but not to any great extent.In the Engineering and Shipbuilding yards there isan excellent increase in output and time, which is 2-8$lower than the Clyde figures, but steady.   The first week inFebruary showed an increase of 1*33$ over the first weekin January.In Flour Milling, of which Liverpool is the largestcentre in the United Kingdom, a steady improvement hasbeen noticed by three separate employers since last June;each.month is better than the last. The figures are notavailable for examination but are estimated by employersas an increase in output of 23$ since June; time-keepingin the same period has improved 30$,PROFITEERING .&apos;The position in regard to high prices is summarisedby a correspondent who has recently visited most of theindustrial areas.   He sorites, &quot;Tho one complaint heardfrom one end of the country to the other is the cost ofliving and if only one or two of the main articles wereto/
to drop in price it would have a wonderful effect.&quot;A fact that must not he overlooked in this connectionis that working men now study the balance sheets of largefirms and the increases in the price of cotton and tobo.ccowill inevitably be compared with the dividends of Messrs,Goats and of the Imperial Tobacco Company,   The proceedingsof the Profiteering Committees are now the object of universcorn and a similar feeling is noticeable in regard to theHouse of Commons, which labour regards as a body of&quot;hard-faced men who look as if they had done well out of thewar,&quot;The sugar ration is the cause of much discontent andit is alleged that there are large stocks to whioh tradeshave unjustifiable access,Various local efforts are being made to deal with themilk supply and on February 16th a meeting of representativeof the Lancashire Farming Community was held in Preston, atwhich it was deoided to draft a scheme for controlling thewholesale milk supply of Lancashire,   A sub-committee wasappointed to draw up a draft scheme which would bs submittedto a general meeting of representatives of all Districts inLancashire,   Creameries will be established in various placeto deal with surplus milk, while dealers will have to makecontracts with the new concern for supplies of milk,   Itis also intended to organise milk distribution, so that itwill be sold at a oentre as near as possible to where it isproduced and it is claimed that thousands of pounds yearlywill be saved by the new system,BRITISH TRANSPORT WORKERS AND THE DUTCH STRIKEThe Dutch Consul General in London has received a lettesigned/
signed by Robert Williams, notifying him that -unless theIhrboh shipowners agree to the international scale of wages,the British dockers will refuse to unload the ships.   Thedockers, sailors and firemen in Holland have appealed totheir British comrades to intervene in their behalf.   Itappears that the crow of the English steamer &quot;Swift&quot; refusedto unload the vessel on arrival at Amsterdam, and it isreported that money has been given or lent to the DutchUnions by the British Unions,   This is an example of theinternational solidarity at which Labour Is aiming.IABQTJR AS EMPLOYEEA manager of one of the Municipal Electrio Lightundertakings in London, who is not a labour supporter, hasgiven an interesting opinion on the influence of the LabourMunicipal Councils upon their employees.   He says that amuch better spirit prevails among the men than when theCouncil was controlled by small employers and shopkeepers.The Councillors are now drawn from the foreman class, whohave more capacity for management and a firmer manner indealing with acts of insubordination than their predecessors.The Labour Councillors keep urging the men to make Municipaltrading a success; unless thwy make it a financial successtheir representatives will be rejeoted at the next eleotion.His opinion was that if a strike occurs the Municipal PublicUtility Concerns would continue to work, but that theCouncil would not,,,countenance any &quot;blacklegging&quot;.   In thecase of a general strike, however, they might allow theMunicipal employees to be called out.LABOUR OOUHCIILORS&apos; VISIT TO EBANOBCouncillor J.J. Vaughan, Mayor of Bethnal Green, statesin the ourrent issue of &quot;The Gall&quot; that, in company withthe/
mm     Q    mmthe Mayor and Mayoress of Fulhain and the Hayor and Mayorsof Shoreditch, he attended a fete at St. Denis, to celebrthe Labour successes in the recent municipal elections.They were not met at the station and had variousadventures, including a visit to the police station,before finding their hosts.   The celebrations included adinner, at which the five English people sang the &quot;ledFlag&quot;, and a wedding of &quot;the selected two prettiest girlsof St. Denis&quot;, at which they signed the register.   Thewriter estimates that 200,000 - 250,000 people took partin a subsequent procession to the theatre,where &quot;all themen famous in the French Socialist Movement&quot; were present,He there delivered a revolutionary speech which was wellreceived.AM&amp;IfiAMATIOMSThe tide of amalgamation, which was so noticeablelast year, is still flowing stronglye   By a majority of 98per cent on a ballot vote the Union of Soginemen, TrainmenBoiler Firemen and Wire Rope Workers has decided toamalgamate with the national Union of General Workers.This decision will bring the membership of tho NationalUnion of General Workers up to 490,000, with funds of 460,000.   .A special conference of tho Soginemen, Stokers andCraftsmenvs Association has decided by 116 votes to 17to recommend thoir. members to vote in favour of tho amendesohemo for amalgamating with the South Wales Miners1Federation.The Rhondda district of tho South Wales DispensersAssociation/
Association has decided to conduct a ballot of members onthe question of seeking affiliation with the South WalesMiners Federation, the Batipnal Union of Clerks, or theDrug Unions.In Scotland the plans are now complete for theamalgamation of the United Operative Masons, the OperativeMasons and Granite Workers, the Tilelayers and the Paviors,and. are to be submitted to the members.   The new body willbe known as the Builders and Monumental Workers&apos;Association.- -PEELING AMONG EK-SERVICE, MEN. , Woolwich has now be come. the centre of dis content, whicharises principally from the discharges from the Arsenal.At,2.30,. ,p.m. yesterday, a number of one-legged ex-servicemen were carrying sandwich boards in Whitehall inscribed: &quot;v.-      &quot;1914YOUR KING AND COUNTRY NEED YOU1920, YOUR SERVICES NO LONGER REQUIRED AT THE ARSENAL&quot;.In other parts of the country the discontent of ex-. soldiers will be shown in anti-Government votes at theelections, but in some districts a change of officials hasresulted in a steadier feeling. -On the other hand, at a recent meeting of the Sheffieldbranch of the National Federation, John Petty, the 02&apos;iganisingsecretary, said that a gigantic demonstration was beingplanned; that there might be a great hunger march from theProvinces to London, and that the-marchers would live on,   the country through which they passed.. \   m    -   * H m : .      &apos; m * - - the/
THE INDBPmENT LABOUR PARTYThe Independent Labour P^rty is still torn betweentwo factions - the one in favour of the Third Internationaand the other of the Second.   Three out of the ninedivisions are for affiliation with Mosoow.   This divisionand the present majority against Moscow has excited the ifof the Soviet Government, which describes the BritishIndependent Labour Party as &quot;reformist&quot; and as &quot;rejectingthe dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.   According to theSoviet view, the only two parties in Europe fit to negotiawith are the French and the Swiss Socialists.THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THB WORLDThe leaders of this organisation are depressed by theindifference of their followers. In spite of urgent whipsvery few members attend meetings and a new plan for outdoomeetings is under consideration.George Hardy, the deportee from America who did a greadeal to keep the movement alive, has now left the countryfor Canada, where the Police will keep him under suryeillatJack Carney, the Editor of the American extremist paper&quot;Truth&quot;, is under a Deportation Order in the United Statesand if he returns to Bngland the movement may receiveanother temporary fillip, otherwise it will be negligible.CONVICTIONFrederick Hedley, extracts from whose speeches weregiven in my 39th report, was sentenced to three months&quot;imprisonment on each of two charges of making statementslikely to cause disaffection, the sentences to runconsecutively; bail was allowed, the prisoner, providingone surety of  50 and two other sureties of the sameamount.   Hedley is identical with 0*Hagan, the Belfastextremist/
-11 - 324extremist mentioned in my reports II, 14 ana 18.   He wastwice imprisoned in Belfast in 1919, for taking part inunlawful assemblies, but was released after hunger striking.m. G330BSB LaNSBUKYMr. George Lansbury had a reoeption in Helsin^forg onhis way to Mosoow.   Madame Vuolijoki, who is regarded asan agent of the &quot;Reds&quot;, gave a dinner party in his honouron the 1st February, and the flattering speeches appear tohave turned Mr. Lansbury&apos;s head; at any rate, he indulgedin inexactitudes.   He said that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was run, entirely by University men; he instanced several prominentmembers of English society who had gone over to Labour,and said that a certain Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen wasa Bolshevik &quot;from toe to head&quot; and had begged him to bringback an autograph photograph of Lenin.   He Is now beingfeted in Mosoow, and we must be prepared, on his return,for facing a better champion of th* Bolsheviks than Mr.Ooode and Colonel M&amp;lone prove to be.   Considering thefinancial straits in which the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; findsitself, it would not be surprising if Mr. Lansbury broughtback funds enough to keep it alive for some time to come.SIMM gSBf &apos;IH CrWM BRITAINMy correspondent has been informed by Mrs. Eady, oneof tne organisers of the Albert Hall meeting, that the. collection realised  150 and programmes  80, and thatthe expenses were between  400 and  500,   The same womanstated that Dublin did not wish Sinn Fein Clubs in England,for they know that such a movement would be suppressedin this country; consequently they could do better if theydia not come into the open.   They are highly delighted withthe Albert Hall meeting.   It is stated that Art 0&apos;3rienis/
is &quot;out for money&quot; and 7,111 now hold &quot;real&quot; Sinn Feinmeetings.   There is a scheme for a house to house collectbut one man stated at Chandos Hall on February 13th thatwhen he called upon 300 Irish people at Clapham, two gavehim  1 each and the rest were highly insulted at beingasked.   A priest said that he had gone round his parish anhad met with no success.Mr. Griffith has been in West Hiding- and my corresponsends the following report:&quot;The Irish factions in the West Riding had afield day on the 15th February at Bradford.&quot;The use of the St. George^ Hall had beenrefused and two halls were taken, the IndependentLabour Party Picture House and tho Palace Theatre,both of which were crowded to hear Mr. A. Griffith,Sean McEoin, Councillor Kelly, of Liverpool(President of the Self-Betermination League! andlocal Irish speakers.&quot;Prior to the meetings Mr.. Griffith was paradedaround the City in a very old fashioned open horsecarriage, seated alongside a priest and McEoin,surrounded by male and female processionists andpreceded by a brass band and Irish pipers.&quot;The gatherings were most enthusiastic andthe clergy seemed to be well to the front.  Apriest took the chair at the Picture House,   Thespeeches were a repetition of those made at theAlbert Hall.&quot;Cathal 0TShannon did not appear, as advertised, atthe Herald League meeting on February 13th because, asthe Chairman said, he was &quot;far too good a man to riskbeing arrested, as there is a warrant out for his arrest,It is reported that in Glasgow Sinn Fein circlesthere are &quot;very strong rumours&quot; to the effect that ageneral armed rising has been arranged to take place allover Ireland on April 5th and that the rebels have enoug&quot;ammunition for 100,000 men.   It is further rumoured thatthe Glasgow Sinn Feiners have been ordered to create asimultaneous diversion by rioting and attacks on factoriand banks.Mr./
Mr. Henderson is reported to havs said that theLabour Party has decided that the Home Rule Act of 1914shall become law, after which an election shall be heldin Ireland.   If as a result of this election the majorityof the Irish should wish for self determination outsidethe British Empire, the Labour Party would concur.IRELANDA large number of outrages of all descriptions havebeen.reported during the week.   None, however, can in anysense be described as retaliation for the recant arrests.,     The arrests, which were confined exclusively to thehigher local;officers of the &quot;Republican Army&quot;, and,therefore, to those who were directly responsible for theoutrages, hare thrown the Sinn Fein ranks into confusion.Those .whc escaped arrest are trying to rally their forcesby making fiery speeches, holding out promises of importantaction in the near future.   The prinoipal leader has leftDublin and is not expected back until the beginning ofMarch.   Violent attacks have been made in the Sinn Feinpress upon the Irish Government and great capital is madeout cf the fact that the arrests and deportations havebeen carried out without charges being preferred againstthe prisoners.The coastguard^ station at Ballyvaughan was raidedat 11.45 p.m. Friday the 13th.   There were no casualties.An Army motor lorry was held up in the streets ofDublin on February ISth and searched by a party of armedmen.   The object of this daring stroke was to rescue acourt-martialled M.P., who, however, had been taken togaol by a different route.   Some soldiers with the lorrywere disarmed and a civilian standing some distanoe away wasshot in the leg.   For political ends, some of the Dublinpapers, notably the &quot;Freeman1s Journal&quot;, have attempted tomake/
make out that the Irish Government had conceded certainpoints to the men of the Irish Drivers and AutomobileUnion whoso strike terminated on February 9th.   This is,however, quite incorrect, the strike having entirely faliein its object.A great many rumours concerning big sor-lo raids and,in some cases, a general rising are in the air.   The datein one case has been fixed for Monday, April the 5th,The probability of a rising seems extremely remote, butthe carrying out of simultaneous raids on military andpolice barracks throughout a large portion of the Southand South-West is quite a possibility.   This plan has beecarefully discussed by the extremist leaders and some oftheir late aotions (e*g. cutting of telephone wires atDunshaughlin, Kavan and Dunboyne) tend towards the ideathat such outrages are the preliminary steps to raids ona big scale in order to see what action will be taken bythe troops and police.   ,
