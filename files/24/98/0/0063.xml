Irtrf ft)jJOCUMFNT IS THE PROPEPTY OP HIS BP IT ANN IC   MAJESTY S......GOVERNMENTPROPOSED PATENT MEDICINES BILL. M.H.11.piMEMOMMDUI/i BY TEE &apos; MINISTER. OF IffiAlall.,I have to ask the sanction of tho Cabinet to the .introduction of a Bill to regulate the sale of patent andsecret remedies on the lines recommended by the Select Committeewhich reported in August, 1914, after an exhaustive enquiryextending over three years.     In view &amp;f tho pressure of warlegislation, no action was taken on the Committee&apos;s Report atthe time, but when the Ministry of Health. Bill was under discussionin the House of Lords,, the question was strongly pressed and theLord Chancellor gave a specific pledge on behalf of the Governmentin the following terms:&quot;&quot;Recognising, as the Government does recognise, first ef all,&quot;that the existing law does not cover those ca3e3;   secondly&quot;that those cases urgently require legislative treatment;   and&quot;thirdly, that the problem Is an immediately pressing one,&quot;the Government authorise me to state., and I do state, that&quot;a very early attempt will be made te carry out in a separate&quot;Bill those specific recommendations of the Committee of which&quot;my noble friend (Lord Bledisloe) was a member^&quot;   (22nd May,1919)The abuses which led to the appointment of the SelectCommittee are increasingly serious, and the Committee found thatlegislation is urgently needed to protect the public against theuse of remedies the sale of which is secured by fraudulent ad-vertlsements and which are either dangerous in themselves orindirectly injurious because they lead to neglect of proper medicaltreatment.    The sale of drugs intended to be used asabortif aclents is a grave scandal which cannot be prevented as thelaw stands at present.    Much harm also is being done by the saleof so-called tonics with an alcohol content equal to that of the
heavier wines.. &apos;which are bought by persons wholly Ignorant thatf&apos;)they are taking alcohol at all, nor is there at present any meansof preventing the sale of &quot;quack&quot; appliances which at best areuseless and often aggravate the complaint which they purport torelieve.     In the interests of public, health it is essential thatthis traffic should be brought under strict control without delay.The Bill which I desire to introduce is framed strictly inaccordance with the Committee&apos;s recommendationst     It Is proposedthat all manufacturers and importers of patent; secret orproprietary remedies and appliances shall be licensed and thatno unregistered person shall be allowed to sell, offer for saleor import any such remedy.    All remedies are to be assigned a&apos;&apos;registered number and the formula is to be furnished to theRegistrar.    The sale of unregistered remedies or of remedies notprepared in strict accordance with the registered formula isspecifically prohibited.     The -minister is given a power (subjectto appeal to the High Court) to remove from the register anyremedy which Is dangerous to health and to cancel the licenseto manufacture or import.    Every medicated wine or other remedycontaining   more alcohol than is required for pharmacologicalpurposes Is required to bear Upon the label a statement of theproportion of alcohol contained in It, and the Minister may, ifhe thinks fit, direct that the name and proportions of any poisonousor potent drug forming an ingredient of any remedy -shall be ex-hiblted upon the label.    The Bill prohibits unconditionally thesale of remedies purporting to cure certain incurable diseases andthe advertisement of any remedy in terms calculated to suggest thatit is capable of use as an abortifacient.     In general, the Billfollows the provisions of the Canadian and Australian Acts, though,
-  3i ,with the object of making it as short-as possible, minor detailsare left to be settled by regulation^The administrative expenses will be met from the fees to becharged for registration and no financial liability will beimposed on the Exchequer*Ministry of Health. G. ADDISON.  .17 ,2*1920.
