CABINET i,  -With the Secretary1 a Compliments.0/Pr36Q.The Home Secretary wishes theattached Draft PIreamrs Bill takenat the Home Affairs Committeeto-morrow (Wednesday) on grounds ofurgency.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W*,17th, February, 1920,
MirFirearms Bill.MEMORANDUM.This Bill carries out the recommendation of the Committeeon the Control of Firearms appointed by the Minister ofReconstruction.  Its objects are (1) To afford an effective system of control over thepossession, use and carrying of firearms and, so faras possible, to secure that they do not come intothe hands of criminal or otherwise unsuitablepersons:(2) To provide a system of control over the manufacture,sale and distribution of firearms which, togetherwith a general prohibition on the export of firearmsunder section 8 of the Customs and Inland RevenueAct of 1879, will enable us to carry out ourobligations under the Arms Traffic Conventionrecently signed in Paris,As regards (1), apart from Defence of the Realm Regu-lations, there is no control whatever over the possession offirearms, and in order to use or carry firearms, a person hasonly to obtain a gun licence at a post office. The Bill providesthat no one in future will be able to purchase or to possessa firearm unless he has obtained a&apos; certificate from the police,and such a certificate will have to be renewed every threeyears. He will also have to provide himself with a gun licencebefore he can legally use or carry his firearm. So far as GreatBritain is concerned, smooth bore shot-guns are not included inthe definition &quot;firearm.&quot;As regards (2), a mere prohibition on export would beuseless. The Board of Customs would not know which packagescontained firearms, and if the prohibition were to be effective,it would be necessary to examine every package and everycargo that left the country. The Bill therefore provides forthe registration of manufacturers and dealers in firearms, andfor keeping record of their transactions. It further providesfor the issue of permits for removal of firearms and ammunitionfrom one place to another, or for export.  These provisions,51-1 a
together with a requirement for pre-entry with the Customs,will be sufficient to render,effective the prohibition upon exportexcept under licence.During the War, control of firearms has been effectivelyexercised under the Defence of the Eealm Regulations. TheseRegulations will shortly lapse, and their place must be takenby statutory provisions if effective control is to be maintainedover firearms in this country and we are to be in a position tofulfil our obligations under the Arms Traffic Convention.
