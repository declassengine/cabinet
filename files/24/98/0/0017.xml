A.C.Treasury, S.W.,12th February, 1920,
^- Estimates are of necessity very rough and it,should he remembered that the cost will doorease every yearand will disappear altogether in sbout 25 years.     The WarOffice Actuary calculates that the present value of thetotal cost may be put at 7 years purchase ox the initialannu&amp;l cost and this figure does not seem at all high,Initial annual cost.\I. Civil Service. 2,000,000II. Army, 1,500,000(plus an unknown amount for pensions to widows which wouldnot however be more than 100,000)III.Navy &apos; 950,000IV. English Police                                          2,500,000This figure is low as it does not allow for an increaseof widows&apos; pensions for \;hich the Home Office are unable tosupply an estimate.     Half the cost falls on local funds.v*     Scotch Police. 90,000Half of this ,only is borne by the E. chequer,VI. Irish 1-olio0.Figures ere not yet available but if we inoroasethe existing charges by the uame proportion as for theEnglish end Scotch Police we yet a rough estimate of700,000VII. English TeachersOnce we increase the Prc-&apos;,7&amp;r pensions we shall have to^ivs :&apos;-&apos;ll retired teacuers pensions on the scale of theTeachers Superannuation Act, 1918, i;nd the Board of Educationestimate the. innual cost of this at 330,000together.   .r ..

together with an immediate lump sici of . 1,500,000if lump are plso given as is the case with teachersretiring after the lat April 1919 but in any ease too re seemsno justification for doing this.VIII.

(   ^      4    i).&apos;7e must add for these  80,000.IX. Railways.The Ministry are quite unable to 3upply an estimatewithout Bending out a circular&apos; asking for information andthey do not wish to	raise any fals(	3&apos; hopes by doing this.	(Initial Cost)		Brccheqiier.	Municipalities.Civil Service	 2*000,000.

Thus apart from the risk of having to give increased aidto Local Authorities and to subs idlee the Railways therewill be a direct initial charge on the Exchequer of somethinglike  7,000,000 a year and the total cost will represent animmediate capital sum of- 50,000,000 at least.Note as to the assumptions *on which the,above estimate isbased.Aa       Civii Service.     Under the existing arrangementsfor counting War bonus for pension the pre-War charge isincreased by a figure not exceeding 40^*   But if thewhole of the present War bonus Is ultimately consolidatedinto salary, as It probably will be, the increase of post-Warpensions over pre-War values will be much greater, and will beproportional to the increase of post-War salaries (includingthe consolidated War bonus) over the pre-Warvscales.    Thisincrease will range from over 100$ for the lowest paid employesto 2bfc for salaries of  2,000,     It is Impossible to get anaccurate estimate of this average increase but it willoertainly not be less thkn 50$ rind this has&quot;accordinglybeen taken as t*he average increase of the pension charge.B.       Army and Navy.     The estimate provides for bringingall pensions up to the rates recently sanctioned by theCabinet. Nc *        Police.    The post-War level is taken to be thatrecommended by the Desborough and Ross CommitteesqD*    &apos;  Teachers *   The English figures are supplied by theBoard of Education and are based on the assumption thatconcessions cannot stop short of giving pensions on the scaleprovided by the Teachers Superannuation Aot of 1918.    TheScotch and Irish figures have been calculated on a proportion-ate basis.
