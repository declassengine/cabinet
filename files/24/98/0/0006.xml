Weather cold and unsettled.(7) The following are extracts from report by General Climo, dated 5th. Thecamps at and above Sora Rogha are bad in wet weather, the ground getting verymuddy and damp preventing the movements of camels, and thus necessitating a delaythat may run into several clays if the weather continues wet.   -Health continues most satisfactory in spite of cold and wet experienced lately.This is directly attributable to liberal clothing and rations issued to troops. I havenot hesitated in stating that, in my opinion, the efficiency of troops is very greatlydue to the fact that all. their wants have been met with liberality and expedition.The medical arrangements work to my entire satisfaction, sick and wounded arebrought down expeditiously with all possible care and comfort. I would also mentionhere that the establishment of messes for officers and other ranks in various rest campsup the line have been most valuable.The R.A.F. continue thoroughly efficient. The construction of a landing groundat Sora Rogha has been invaluable and has enabled machines to keep in much closertouch with the column with the expenditure of a fraction of energy. On 1st Februarymachines re-filled there instead of having to return to Tank, thereby carrying outthree times the amount of bombing they could have otherwise have done. It has alsobeen found possible to make a landing ground at Khirgi, which will be most valuableat all times.Paras. (4) and (7) not communicated to Press.
