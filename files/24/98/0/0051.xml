WINSTON S. CHfRCHILL.1602c200itI circulate the attached memorandumfor the urgent consideration of the Cabinet.
ND FOR SURRENDER OF GERMAN   AIRMEN FOR TRIAL.^Jf^h^^ The Air Council observe from the &quot;Times&quot; ofthe 9th of February tliat the surrender of the followingGerman personnel are demanded by H.M. Governmenti viz.,&quot;    For attacks on undefended British townsby airships and aeroplanes:   Linnarz, commanderof airship which bombarded the London districton May 31st 1916a    Boeker., Commander of theairship which bombarded Hull on March 5th 1916,and Edinburgh on April 3rd 1916?    All persons,crews included, who were concerned in or respon3i*ble for the aeroplane attacks on Kent, Essex,and London on December the 5th and 6th, 1917,and on the London district on May 19th and 20th,1918&quot;.2. The Air Council feel compelled to refer to theirmemorandum to the Cabinet of the 26th of September, printedas a Cabinet paper numbered G*T*3258, in which they representedin the strongest possible terms that the contemplated proceedingsagainst German air officers and men for participating in bombingraids over London were at once unjust and inexpedient.   Theirview was concurred in by the Army Council (Cabinet paper G*T*8280).3. The Cabinet decided, on the 16th of October, 1919(Paper 631), that each case (of accused enemy aviators) shouldbe left for settlement on its merits between the Secretary ofState for War and the Lsf Officers.      This was understood tomean that the Air Ministry would be-consulted in regard to eachname proposed.4. The Air Council represent to the Cabinet that theCabinet^ decision has not been carried out.5. The Air Council are, therefore, compelled to urgethe instant consideration of the Cabinet to the gravity of theissues involved by the demand in question.6. The reasoned opinion of the Air Council on thegeneral question is given in their memorandum of the 26th ofSeptember   That dealt with raids over London, but is equallyapplicable to raids over Edinburgh and Hull, both of -whichcities contain military objective s.7. But the present situation makes It necessary toemphasize the peculiar reverberation of such contemplatedprosecutions&apos; upon the R.A.F.   These German officers and menare to be tried in time of peace before a court exclusivelycomposed of their ex^enemles for acts which do not differfrom those ordered to be carried out by the Royal Air Forceupon German towns *   The orders given included directions tobomb German towns (where any military objective was situate),to destroy the industrial activities there by bombings duringthe day, and to weaken the morale of the civilian inhabitants(and thereby their &quot;will- to win&quot;) by persistent bomb attaokswhich would both destroy life (civilian and otherwise) andshould, if possible, originate a conflagration which shouldreduce to ashes the whole town and thereby delete a wholecentre of industrial activity.8* In pursuance of these orders, endeavours were made toset towns on fire by dropping inflammable bombs (as was done inthe German raid over London on 6/6th December, 1917), and todestroy life by dropping small man-killing bombs (as was done inthe German raid over London on 31st of May, 1916).
9. The Air Force in France were repeatedly ordered tobomb objectives in Germany, and very often, owing to theweather, lost their way, with the result that they bombedObjectives which they thought were right, but which were reallynot the objectives which they were ordered to bomb.A large percentage of the bombs dropped by ourpilots were dropped on objectives which were not orderedp   Is itjustice,, therefore, to charge these German pilots, who for thesame reasons and considerations, did to us what we did to them?10. If these prosecutions are carried out and the accusedare convicted, it is not too much to say that for future wars themorale of the R *A ,F c will be ruined.   Omitting all furtherconsiderations of justice in the matter and talcing solely thelowest standpoint of expediency, it is obvious that every officerand airman will go into the next war with the feeling of a halterround- hi3 neck.    He will know that hs is liable to be ordered tocarry out acts which his own Government have in the last warpunished as crimes when committed by enemies, and justified aseither legitimate military operations or reprisals when committedby themselves.    He will know that if captured by the enemy hewill be tried for a war crime by a court of his enemies, whowith the British precedents before them are not likely to beappreciative of any juridical niceties which he may attempt toplead *   He will know that superior orders form no defence forthe British precedents included as criminals for trial allpersons &quot;crews included&quot; who took part in certain raids.   Even ifnot taken prisoners, the question of his ultimate inclusion in theproscription will depend entirely on which side Is victoriousin the struggle.11. As regards the defence of superior orders, it isobserved that Mr* Balfour speaking for the Government in theHouse of Commons last night,, announced that the list &quot;includesnobody who did an illegal act because he wa3 ordered to do itand who did not go beyond hi3 orders&quot;e    As this is not consistentwith the express inclusion of &quot;all persoLs-, crews included&quot;, inthe list of criminals^, the Council infer thaT&quot;tne list as givenin the Press was either textually corrupt in this respect or hassince been amended so as to exclude these cases.12e , The Air Council cannot represent too,strongly theirconsidered view that the policy of prosecution will producehistorical consequences of a disastrous nature upon the future ofthe R.A.F., and they would urge that the Cabinet should giveorders not&apos;merely for the withdrawal of the charges againstthe &quot;crews&quot; (in conformity with the statement in Parliamentyesterday) but that the whole charges against enemy aviators(whether held in captivity in this country or at present inGermany) should be expunged from the list.   ,
