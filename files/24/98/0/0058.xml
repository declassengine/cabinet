THIb DOCUMENT IS TEfi PROPERTY OP   EIS BRITANNICiqjESTY?S GOVSRMBEiT. -Cabinet.feoRAITDUM OK TE3 OVERSEAS COlvSMERCIAL SERVICESBY SIR. HAMAR GRB3NW00D.I cams to the Department of Ore]?seas Irad3 I havecontinued the investigation begun by my predecessor in jo theconditions of our overseas commercial services, i.e., the vConsular Service, the Commercial Diplomatic Service, and theTrade Co;i&amp;ussioner Service.     Suoh an Investigation is anessential and fundamental part of the task of the Departmentof Overseas Trade, seeing that, without a properly peid aikdequipped overseas service to collect information and te representBritish trade interests abroad, the work of Ihe JDep .rtment athome Is a sheer waste of public money.Consular Service.It has long been a commonplace that Consalar Officerswere grossly underpaid before the war..    Their salaries thenwere:- -Vice-Coasuls  300 rising to tf&amp;OOConsuls (End.  .600   -V      &quot;    700Grade )Consols. (1st  800Grade &apos;)Consuls General  900,  1,000 and  1,200.Local allowances were also provided in some countries,but generally on a low scale.Sir Arthur Stecl-Maitland last spring proposed new scales$    of salary and allowances designed to remedy the pre-war disabilitiesOf Consular Officers, and .to put them in a position in fairly        .normal times to discharge their duties.    The Cabinet approved$hese proposals in prinoiple, subject to the discussion of certaindetails with the Treasury.    The rates of salary as finals-agreedwith the Treasury are:-
Yice-Censrls  300 rising to  600Consols  800     &quot;        &quot;  1,000Oonsu.ls.-Gep.oral         1200   &quot;      n    1,500In addition representation allowances are given rangingfrom  100 to  400 end rent allowances ranging from  50 to  250according to grade and duties.,It is at this point that a difference of opinion hss -arisen between the Treasury and my. Department. . Sir ArthurSteol-Maitland expressly contemplated the grant of fnil existingrates of war bonus in.addition to,the new scales.  . The Treasury,,howerer, take the view that the new rates of salary must be   &apos;held, not only to remedy the pre-war disabilities, of Consular&apos; -Officers, but also largely to compensate them for, the increasedcost of living arising out. of war conditions,   . They, therefore,&apos;stipulate that the war bonus, previously given snail oease as fromthe date of the. introduction of the new scales, and will&apos; onlyconsent to consider the grant of war.bonus in countries inwhich the cost of living has gone up $$/1C0$, or more, and &apos;  :then only to the extent of hall&quot; the increase over 100$. :&apos;-This would put me in a most, difficult position.    -The Consular Service has long been led to expect an improvement&apos; &apos;in its previous intolerable conditions.    The straits to which ^Consular Officers have in some cases been reduced;in: the past v:;&apos;-&apos;are almost unbelievable.    Many resignations; have taken&apos; place-.&apos; &quot;&apos; -Many of those who remain have had to -suffer positive: indignity;in the vain endeavour tt keep expenditure within inceme.     Morethan one instance has come to light . in. which&apos; officers have been - &apos;in such palpable distress that .they have actually received offersof assistance from the local British-community and even from&apos;well-intentioned foreigners.,
The effect on the service will he deplorable if they nowfind that the long expected improvements in salaries andallowances are to be rendered nugatory in present economicconditions by the refusal to give them an adequate war bonus.I feel bound to press for full war bonus In addition to thenew pay and allowances, in accordance with the oleor intention6f Sir Arthur Steel-Maitlandrs scheme.    I am prepared to takeas a basis the recommendations of an undoubted expert - Dr.Bowley - who was appointed by the Treasury Itself to investigatethis very problem.    His report is full of feeling as to thestraits to which Consuls have been reduced in the past.    Herecommends that, in addition to the new scales of salary andsllo?/ances, war bonus should be given at the rate of 66$ of thetotal increase in the cost of living as compared with pre-warconditions on the portion of salary spent in the foreign country,and at the rate of 50$ on the portion of salary spent at home.. I feel most strongly that this is essential if widespreaddissatisfaction and inefficiency in the Consular Service andagitations in the House of Commons and Press are to be avoided.11 * Oeogaeroial Diplomatic &amp; Trade&apos;. \       Commissioner Service.,The same question arises in the case of the CommercialDiplomatic and Trade Commissioner Services.     There too newscales of salary, rent, and representation allowances have beenagreed upon, but the Treasury not only stipulate that full warbonus shall not be paid but also propose to withdraw localallowances at present enjoyed by the officers of these sorvices.Here too, and for the same reason, I feel bound to preBS thatwar bonus shall be given on the scale proposed above for theConsular Service, namely at the rate of 66$ of the totalincrease in the oost of living as compared with pre-warconditions on the portion of salary spent in the foreigncountry, and at the rate of 50$ on the portion of salaryspent at home.H* G&apos; 16. 2. 20.
