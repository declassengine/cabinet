MR. C. LCNGHURST,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   February ] 920.SECRET.C.P.-669.CABINET.THE DECONTROL OF SUGAR.Memorandum from the Chairman or the Eoyal Commission on the SugarSupply to the Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Decontrol of*Food.(Reference C.P.-655.)1. I welcome your invitation to furnish you with a note on the decontrol ofsugar, because this question is so intimately connected with that of the price of sugar,now under consideration, that neither of the two can be adequately discussed withoutreference to the other.2. Ever since the Armistice the Commission has had in mind the question ofdecontrol, and from time to time discussed it. On the general principle that controlshould cease at the earliest possible moment we are, and always have been, unanimous.On the question of the time and circumstances at which the &quot; earliest possible moment&quot;could be said to have arrived, there is some difference of opinion. But I think I cansafely say that the views, which I am about to express in this paper, represent thoseentertained by the great majority of the Commission, although time does not allow ofmy submitting them to all my colleagues before sending them to you.3. I propose first to examine the question of an immediate, or very early, with-drawal of control; and to show why we do not think that this, although conceivablypossible, would be expedient either politically or economically; secondly to describe theconditions which we think must be established before the transition from control tofreedom of trade can be safely effected ; and finally to say what can be said, littleenough though it must be, as to the date at which those conditions may have establishedthemselves.I. Immediate Decontrol.4. For five and a-half years the Government has made itself responsible formaintaining the sugar supply of the country. For some weeks at the beginning of thewar, and for some months during 1919, traders were permitted to import, concurrentlywith the Royal Commission ; and during the whole period of the war certain classes ofsugar, brewing sugars and British West Indian sugars, have been left largely outsidethe operations of the Commission, and have been allowed to be imported by privatetraders, under licence, and subject to certain prescribed conditions. But these representa small proportion of the total sugar supply; and substantially it may be said thatGovernment has exercised a monoply in the importation of sugar. As a consequencethe ordinary agencies and machinery of the trade in sugar have been put out of action.They have been utilised to a certain extent by the Sugar Commission, but mainly in theprovince of distribution. As regards importation, the business of merchants has beenalmost wholly suspended; only brokerage business, and in that only the business ofthe larger brokers, has continued in operation. Further, the effect of the war hasbeen to create a revolution in the course and mechanism of the trade in sugar; andthis is a point of so much importance that something of a digression becomes necessaryto explain it.5. In popular discussions about sugar, the distinction between raw and refined isapt to be overlooked. Yet it is all important. Sugar is not sugar at all, in theconsumers sense, until it has been refined. Now if we were consuming sugar at thesame rate per head that we were doing before the war we should want some1,800,000 tons of refined; and as our existing refineries cannot turn Out more thanabout one-half of that quantity, we should have to import some 900,000 tons of refined.Before the war, in 1913, the imports of refined were 47 per cent, of the total importand drawn wholly from the Continent (in 1900 they had been 59 per cent.), while of the[2356] b
raw imported no less than 65 per cent, came from the Continent. Now the continentalsupply will, for a time at any rate, be cut off, both for raw and refined (except toa very limited extent), and although in time this source of supply may revive, it isdoubtful whether it can ever again resume the place it had before the war. Theconsequence is that both for raw and refined, we shall have for the immediate future tolook only to very distant sources of supply (Cuba and Java are the predominant ones).What this means to the trade I can illustrate by an example. Take a single refinery,melting 3,500 tons of raw sugar a week. Before the war it drew practically thewhole of its supplies from the beet fields of Europe. In Hamburg there were alwaysample stocks, and between the making of a contract for raw sugar and its arrival at the 1refinery no more than a week or ten days would elapse. Now the supplies must bedrawn from the cane of Cuba and Java, and, for the nearer of these markets, six weeks- must elapse between payment of the f.o.b. price of the sugar and its arrival at therefinery. Thus some 21,000 tons of raw would be constantly in transit, and at thepresent price and present rate of exchange, the refiner would have about 1,500,000L ofcapital outstanding on his purchases. On this scale the financing of their businesswould be beyond the capacity of any of the twelve refineries in the country. Thebusiness of importing refined would also be much more difficult&apos;than it was before thewar. Then refined could be imported from near ports and in small consignments. Nowit will have to be drawn mainly from the United States of America in larger quantitiesand in face of a fierce competition in a market which will be without serious rivals.6. Looking to these facts, and also to the uncertainties of the exchanges and offreights, it seems clear that were control removed suddenly, the business of importingsugar would for a time be a huge gamble in which only very bold buyers, with powerfulfinancial backing, could engage. There would be heavy losses on some transactions(we know of one case in which on a single cargo sold to France last autumn for Februarydelivery, and not covered by a forward contract at the time, the operator stands to lose100,OOOL), and to cover such losses, traders would have to be free to make correspondinggains, which would promptly give rise to an outcry against &quot;profiteering.&quot; Therewould also be the danger that in the confusion there might, and almost certainly would,be moments at which the supplies required to maintain consumption would not be forth-coming. It may be said, and possibly with truth, that things would right themselvesin time ; or even that sooner or later we shall have to face a crisis, and that the soonerwe face it the better. But, in the opinion of the majority of the Commission, it wouldbe wrong to precipitate, and perhaps aggravate, the crisis by casting adrift, without duenotice and preparation, an industry that has been nursed by the Government for fiveand a-half years; and we hold that as much as possible must be done to render thetransition from control to freedom of trade, as little difficult to the trade, and as littleinconvenient, and even dangerous, to the community as the circumstances will allow.II. Conditions required for Decontrol.7. The business of importing sugar is, at the present moment, subject to manydifficulties, of which the principal ones are due to (a.) The fact that the world&apos;s supply of sugar is, at any rate for the moment,barely equal to the demand.(6.) The uncertainty of the exchanges.(c.) The difficulty of obtaining freight and the uncertainty of the rates at which itcan be obtained.The Commission suffers under the full weight of the first two. As regards thethird it is relieved by the Ministry of Shipping from anxiety in respect of rates offreight, but in respect of obtaining freight at the time when it is actually needed, itregrets that it is far from satisfied with the way in which the agency of the Ministryhas operated, more especially in recent months, during which heavy loss has beeninflicted on the Commission through the failure of the Ministry to supply vessels at theproper dates. Traders would be&apos; exposed to the full force of all these difficulties, and, asmay be gathered from what has already been said, the Commission does not think thatthey could be relied upon to, overcome them without risk, certainly of great disturbanceof prices, and possibly of a failure in supplies. To qualify it to do this, the trade musthave found its legs again, after these y^ars of suspended animation, and that it can onlydo by resuming business gradually, and concurrently with the Commission. Now itwould be useless to expect the trfds to resume business, concurrently with the
Commission to any effective extent, unless it can trade on equal terms with theCommission. So long as the Commission enjoys advantages which enable it to importat a less cost than the private trader, and has in hand funds from previous tradingwhich enable it to sell below present cost prices, the private trader cannot compete.Therefore, the first and most essential step towards a rehabilitation of the normalmachinery of the sugar market, is that the Commission should put its transactions inrespect both of buying and selling on a market basis, and that it should then surrenderits monopoly rights of importation. If this were done private trade would be graduallyresumed, and as soon as it showed sufficient signs of strength, the Commission couldcease purchasing, dispose of its stocks, and go out of business. Obviously, however,this means an increase in competition for sugar in the producing markets, and at thepresent moment it is not desirable to stimulate such competition. When it couldsafely be allowed would turn upon considerations dealt with in the next section of thisnote. Meanwhile, it may be opportune to suggest that, in considering the figure atwhich the imminent advance in the price of sugar is to be put, it will be well to keepin mind the eventual necessity of equalising the Commission^ price with the commercialprice, as a condition precedent of decontrol. The nearer and the sooner we can getto an equality the better; and if any wide margin is to be left for a time, it wouldseem advisable to keep in hand enough of,the present high duty to relieve the pinchwhen the final advance has to be made.III. Date when conditions will be favourable for Decontrol.&apos; 8. On existing data it is not possible to name even an approximate time at whichthe conditions will have become such as will make decontrol practicable and safe. Iattach an estimate (or, as he rightly prefers to call it, a &quot; series of guesses &quot;) made bySir Robert Lyle for the year 1920, of the exportable surpluses of the sugar-producingcountries, and of the. demands that will be made.upon them by the countries whichimport sugar. I do not suppose that there is in any country any person betterqualified than Sir Robert to make such an estimate, and his own diffidence as to itsvalue is a significant feature not to be overlooked. The estimate (on the assumptionthat consumption in the United Kingdom will be controlled throughout 1920) shows asurplus of supplies of 583,000 tons, or about 8&quot;5 per cent, of the total imports of allcountries. This, so far as it goes, is satisfactory. But it does not go far enough togive assurance that markets will become much easier before the end of the year. Amargin of 583,000 tons for the whole world, and for a whole year, is very narrow,having regard to the fact that its availability must depend upon the location of stocks,upon how they are held, and more especially upon the time at which they can comeupon the market. It might well be that, although on a year as a whole there might bea surplus of 500,000 or 600,000 tons, there might at times be a deficiency, and thiswould give rise to violent fluctuations in prices. On the whole, the evidence seems topoint to the conclusion that there can be no great amelioration of the present priceconditions before the end of 1920.9. It is too early in the year to make any forecast as to the prospects of 1921.They depend upon the promises of the harvests in Cuba (beginning in December) andin Java (beginning in June), and of the beet crops of Europe (sown in May andbeginning to be reaped in October). Thus our forward vision is strictly limited to1920, and in regard to this one can only say-that, while it is unlikely that things willget worse than they are, there is not much ground for expecting improvement, andthat any improvement there may be will not be great.10. The outcome of all this seems to be that the problem of when decontrol canbe safely and conveniently effected must for the moment be left unsolved. Butinasmuch as its solution at any time is dependent, as already shown, on a rehabilitationof the normal agencies of trade it may be said that the really important thing is to seton foot as soon as possible measures to that end. of which the very first is to equaliseas early as possible the Commission^ selling prices with the prices which traders wouldhave to charge were they doing the business of importation. Once the trade getsmoving it would not be long before it would be possible to obtain indications enablingthe Commission to judge how soon the whole business could be left to it. In 1914private trade went on freely side by side with the Commission till near the end ofOctober. Then it was stopped, not for the protection of the Commission but becauseit was feared that it would enable Germany and Austria to export their sugars toneutral countries, in which it would only replace sugar sold to us by those countries.But although this was the immediate motive ,of the prohibition of import it was
gradually becoming apparent that the Government could not for long carry on itsoperations for maintaining a supply of sugar without assuming to itself a monopoly,because, sugar being plentiful, private traders could always undersell it for so long assupplies could be obtained, and tbe Government stocks would for many months haveserved no other purpose than that of a reserve on which the trade would fall backwhen it had exhausted the outside markets. If we now reverted to the position as itwas August-October 1914, an absolutely sure indication that control was no longernecessary would be afforded, if the Commission should at any time find that it hada difficulty in disposing of its stocks. But probably it Would not be necessary to waitfor that sign. Before such a condition of things arose there would be otherindications which would be sufficient to enable the Government to form a judgmentas to whether the moment for decontrol was arriving. But in any case it is certainthat when the moment arrives for decontrol the Commission must be prepared to beconfronted with a fall in prices which will make a demand greater or less as the casemay be on its financial resources; and accordingly it must in anticipation build upa reserve which shall be adequate to meet the loss that will be incurred as estimatedon a reasonable basis.11. In case the views expressed above should commend themselves to yourapproval it is possible that you may wish to be furnished by the Commission withsuggestions as to the immediate steps which should be taken in furtherance of thegeneral policy indicated, whether as respects the changes to be made in the sellingprices of sugar or otherwise. Should this be so I shall be ready to arrange for a fulldiscussion of the subject by the Commission, and will then let you know whatmeasures we should recommend for immediate adoption as steps towards the positionin which we think that decontrol will become practicable.(Signed)        H.
