BIW    ZEAIA2JD    MEAT     CONTRACT.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,The Board of Trade have a contract with the HewZealand Government for the purchase of the exportablesurplus of meat from lew Zealand for the period of thewar and three months1 thereafter.   At the&apos;request of thatGovernment it was subsequently extended to include allmeat put into cold store by 30th June, 1920.In September, 1919, the New Zealand Government,moved by reports that His Majesty^ Government wereintending, to purchase Australian and Argentine meat for&quot;another year&quot; asked   for an extension   of the Hew Zealandcontract for a &quot;corresponding period&quot;.   The Board ofTrade after consultation with the Ministry of Poodnotified the High Commissioner for Hew Zealand on October22nd,that( they did not propose to extend any contractsbeyond June 30th, 1920, and in reply to a renewed requestthey sent a similar reply in January after the Cabinethad decided against any extension of meat contracts.The High Commissioner for He?; Zealand wrote againon January 29th, at the request of his Government, askingthat an extension of the present contract &quot;for six monthsor at least three months&quot; should receive the earlyconsideration of His MajestyTs Government so as to enablethe stores to be cleared before the opening of the newseason.   The Prime Ministers telegram pointed out that&quot;as the period referred to is the off-season there will bepractically no increase in the number of carcases up toDecember 1st.1   The High Commissioner added that as anyGovernment Owned meat in cold store on June 30th wouldhave priority of shipment, private killings would not beshipped, and the resulting uncertainty as to clearanceof stocks would detrimentally affect financial and otherarrangements for new season.It is not clear why if there will be &quot;practicallyno inorease in carcases&quot; so serious an injury should beinflicted on New Zealand producers.   It is not unlixelythat there will be 120,000 tons of meat in cold-store inNew Zealand awaiting shipment on June 30th, and the Boardof Trade will bo interested in getting that meat shippedas speedily as possible in order to avoid the expenses ofstorage and insurance.   By extending the contract up to30th June, paying advances of 75^ of the value of meat instore, and assuming the responsibility for storage andinsurance, the Board have relieved the New Zealand producersof very heavy risks in a difficult period, and theresponsibilities on the Board arising out of the presentcongestion in oold stores in the United Kingdom are ex-tremely heavy.   It does not seem unfair that the producersin the&apos;Dominion should bear the risks of the fag-end of theseason, whioh their Government admit would be very small.
I shall he glad to-have the authority of theCabinet for refusing&apos;the request of the New ZealandGovernment *It is however possible,that the Australiancontract, which runs for three months after the legaltermination of the war, may owing to delay in concludingpeace with Turkey be prolonged until after the 30th June1920.   I should propose therefore in such an eventualityto explain to the New Zealand Government that His Majesty1sGovernment would agree to prolong the New Zealand contractto a corresponding extent.&apos;   A*C* GSDDSS.17th February 1920.
