AMERICAN EMBASSY, .LONDON,February 12, 1920.The following is the.text of a communication fromthe Secretary of State of the United States of Americato the American Ambassador in Paris which, in accordancewith the instructions therein confined, will be deliveredby the American Ambassador in Paris to the French ForeignOffice and to the British Embassy in Paris and which, pursuantto the request of Ambassador Wallace, is furnished to thePrime Ministers of Great Britain and France by the AmericanAmbassador in London, in order   that they may bo informedthereof at the earliest practicable moment:Please communicate the following to the British andFrench representativos:The President has carefully considered the jointtelegram addressed to this Government by French and BritishPrime Ministers and communicated by the American Ambassadorin Paris in regard to the negotiations on the Adriaticquestion.     The President notes with satisfaction that theFrench, British and Japanese Governments have never had theintention of proceeding to a definite settlement of thisquestion except in consultation with the American Government.The President was particularly happy to receive this assuranceas he understood that........................................
Monsieur Glcmenrtcau and Mr. Lloyd^George in agreementwith Signor Uitti had decided upon a solution of theAdriatic question whioh inclu&amp;ed provisions previouslyrojactod by the American Government and had called uj/onthe Jugoslav representatives to accept this solutionon pain of having the Treaty of iondon enforced in daseof rejection.     The President is glad to feel that iheassociates of this Government would not consent toembarrass it by pCLacing it in the necessity of refusingadhesion to a settlement which in form would be anagreement by both parties to the -controversy but whichin fact would not havo that great merit and one party wasfor cod to submit to material injustice by threats of stillgreater calamities in default of submission.     The Presidentfully shares the view of the Jftrench and British Governmentthat the future of the world largely depends upon the ribhtsolution of this question but he oannot believo that a   *solution containing provisions which have already receivedthe well-merited condemnation of tho Srench and BritishGovernments can in&apos;any sense be regarded as ^rijat.    neithercan he share the opinion of the jVench and 3ritish Govern-ments that the proposals contained in their memorandumdelivered to the Jugoslav representatives on January 14thleave untouched practically every i-iportant ooint of thejoint memorandum of the irronch, British and America Govern-ments, of December 9th,1919, and that &quot;only two featuresundergo alterations and both these alterations aro to thepositive advantage of Jligo-Slavia&quot;,    On the contrary, thoproposal of December 9th has been profoundly altered to &quot;tiieadvantage of Italian objectives to the serious injury of
t&amp;WagGM&amp;&amp;v people and to the peril of world peace.   aWTioff!L       .4that eucu fr)g^t^ *^^ tou14,appear to be borne out ,by the fact that the ItaJdM^^^rojected the proposal of December 9th and accented that ofJanuary 14th.Hie memorandum of December 9th rejected the device ofconnecting Flume with Italy by a narrow strip of coast territoryas quite unworkable in practice and as invwlvlng extrarrdJLaarycomplexities as regards customs control, coast guard services,and cognate matters in a territory of such unusual omfigw&amp;tlm*.The French and British Governments in association with theAmerican Government expressed the Opinion that &quot;Sie plan appearsto run counter to every consideration of geography, economiesand territorial convenience&quot;.    Hie American&quot;Government notesthat this annexation of Jugo-Slav territory by Italy is&apos;never-theless agreed to by the memorandum of January 14th.     Ehememorandum of December 9th rejected Italy1s demand for theannexation of all of Istria on the solid ground that neitherstrategic nor economic considerations could justify such annex-ation and that there remained nothing in defence of the propo-sition save Italy&apos;s desire for more territory admittedlyinhabited by Jugo-Slavs.     Bie French and British Governments &apos;then expressed their cordial approval of the way in whioh the resident has (x) every successive Italian demand for theabsorption in Italy of territories inhabited by peoples not )Italian and not in favor of being absorbed and joinMiAn theopinion that &quot;It is neither just nor expedient to annex as thespoils of war territories inhabited by an alien race,&quot;&apos; yet thisunjust and inexpedient annexation of all of Istria is providedfor in the memorandum. -a^Jan-uaiy .14 th.   The memorandum o$
December 9th carefully excluded every form of ItalianSovereignty over Fiume.   The American Government cannot avoidthe conclusion that the memorandum cf January 14th opens theway, for Italian control of Hurno^ foreign affairs, thusintroducing a measure of Italian sovereignty;over, and Italianintervention in the only&apos;practicable port of a neighboringpeople, and taken in ccnjunction with the extension of Italianterritory to the gates of Flume, paves the way for possiblefuture annexation, of the1 port by Italy in contradiction ofcompelling considerations if equity aad right.   The memorandumof December 9th afforded proper protection to tho vital railwayconnecting Hume northward with the interior.   The memorandumof January 14th establishes Italy in dominating militarypositions closo to tho railway at a number of critical points.The memorandum of Leoember 9th maintained Ib- largemeasure the unity of the Albanian State.   That of January 14thpartitions the Ubanian people against their vehement protestsamong three different alien powers.These and other provisions of the memorandum ofJanuary 14th naggtiated without the knowledge or approval ofthe American Government change the whole faoe of the Adriaticsettlement and in the eyes of this Government render it un-workable and rob it of that measure of justice which is essentialif this Government is to co-oporate in maintaining its terms.The fact that the Jugoslav representatives might feel forcedto accept in $ho face of tie alternative of the Treaty ofLondon, a solution which appears to this Government so unfair &apos;in principle and so unworkable in practice, would not in any 3degree alter the conviction of this Government that it cannot&apos;give its assent to a settlement whioh both in the terms of itsprovisions and in the -methods of its enforcement, constitutes\
Illa positivo denial of the principles  oT^TtoXah-J&amp;erlim^^ -the war.The matter would wear a very different aspect ifthere wore any real divergence of opinion as to what constitutesa just settlement of the Adriatic issuo.   Happily no suchdivergence exists.   The-&apos;opinions of tho ?ronch, British, andAmerican Governments as to a just and equitable territorialarrangement at the head of the Adriatic.-.Sea woro strixinglyharmonious.   Italy1s unjust demands had boon condemned by theFrenofr and British Governments in terms no less severe thanthoso employed by the American Government.   Certainly theFrench and British Governments will yield nothing to theirAmerican associate as regards the earnestness with which theyhave sort to convince the Italian Government that fulfillmentof its demands would be contrary to Italy1a own best interests,opposed to tho spirit of justice in international dealings,and fraught with danger to tho peace of r,uropo.   In particulartho French and British Governments have opposed Italy Ts demandsfor spooific advantages which it is now proposed to yield toher by the memorandum of January 14th and have joined in &quot;in-forming the Italian Government that the concessions previouslymade &quot;afford to Italy full satisfaction of hor historic nationalaspirations, based on the desire to unite the Italian race, giveher the absolute strategic control of tho adriatic, and offerhor complete guarantees against whatever aggressions., she mightfear in the future from her Jugo-Slav nelghbowe-&quot;.While there is thus substantial agreement as tothe injustice and inoxpodien^o^Of-Ttaly^s claims, thoro is adifference of opinion as to how firmly Italy&apos;s friends shouldresist her importunate demands for alien territories to whichshe can present no valid title.   It has seemed to tho President
that French and British associates of the AmericanGovernment, in order to prevent the development ofpossibly dangerous complications in the Adriatic regionhave felt constrained to go very far in yielding todemands which they have lorg oppoced as unjust.   The   -American Government while no less generous in its desireto accord to Italy every advantage to which she couldoffer any proper claims feels that it cannot sacrifice theprinciple for which it entered the war to gratify theimproper ambitions of one of its associates or to purchasea. temporary appearance of calm in the Adriatic at theprice of a future world conflagration.   It is unwillingto recognise either an unjust settlement based on a secrettreaty the terms of&quot; which arc inconsistent with the newworld conditions or an unjust settlement arrived at byemploying that secret treaty as an instrument of coercion.It would welcome any solution of the problem based on afree and unprejudiced consideration of the merits of thecontraversy or on terms which the disinterested Greatpowers agreed to be just ana equitable.   Italy, however,has repeatedly rejected such solutions.   This Governmentcannot accept a settlement the terms of which have beenadmitted to be unwise and unjust but which it is proposedto grant to Italy ir; view of her persistent refusal toaccept any wise and just solution.It ic a time to speak with tho utmost frankness.   The&apos;Adriatic issue as it now presents itself raises thefundamental question as to whether the American Governmentcan on any terms co-operate with its European associatesin the great work of maintaining the peace of the world
by7 removing tho-primary causes of war.   This Governmentdoes not doubt its ability to roach amicable, understand-ings with the Associated Governments as to wh&amp;t con-^stitutos equity and justice in international dealings:,for difference of opinion as to tho host methods ofapplying just principles have nover obscured the vitalfact that in the main tho several Governments haveentertained tha same fundamental conception of what thoseprinciples arc.   But if substantial agreement toprinciple if just and reasonable is not to determineinternational issues;   if the country possessing the mostendurance in pressing its demands rather than tho eountryarmed with a just cause is to gain the support of thoPowers;   if forcible seizure of covotod areas is to bepermitted and condoned and is to receive Ultimate justifi-cation by creating a situation so difficult that decisionfavourable to the aggressor is deemed a practical necessity;if deliberately incited ambition is, under the nams of.national sentimewt, to be rewarded at the expense, of thesmall and tho woaic;   if, in a word, the old order ofthings which brought so many evils on the world is stillto prevail, then tho time is not yet come when thiBGovernment can sntsr a concert of powers, the veryexistence of which must depend upon a new spirit and anew order.     The American people are willing to sharein such high enterprise;     but many among thorn are fearfullest they boooma entangled in international policies andcommittGd to international obligations foreign alilcoto their ideals and their traditions.     To commit them to
such a policy as that embodied in the latest Adriaticproposals and to obligate them to maintain injusticeas against the claim?; of justice would be to providethe most solid ground for such fears.   This Governmentcan undertake nc such grave responsibility.LAKSIlvG.If it does not appear&quot;feasible to secure accept-ance of the just and generous concessions efferedby the British, French and American Governments toItaly in\the joint memorandum of those Powers ofDecember 9th, 1919, which the President has alreadyclearly stated tc be the maximum concessions that theGovernment of the United states can offer, the Presidentdesires to say that he must take under serious considera-tion the withdrawal.of the Treaty with Germany and theagreement between the united States and Prance of June28th, 1919, which are now before the Senate and permittingthe terms of the liruropejan settlement to be independently-established and enforced by the Associated Governments.* \.................) )\f
THF, ADRIATIC.Memorandum &quot;by the Prime Ministers of Franco andGreat Britain in renly to President &apos;7ils6n&apos;scommunication received bn February14th, 192b.L01TDOI:!;17th February, 1920.Tho Prime Ministers of Franco and Groat Britain havegiven their earnest attention to tho communication made, tothem in regard to the Adriatic settlement on behalf ofPresident Wilson.   They are -.dad that tho Government ofthe United States has set forth its views so fully and withsuch complete frankness.   They do not, howevert find italtogether easy to understand the steps by whioh tho Govorn-mcnt of the United States has arrived at its present attitude.In tho first place thoy believe that there is nofoundation for tho assumption which underlies tho Americancommunication, that the proposed settlement outlined intheir telegram of January &apos;20th involves- a capitulation tothe Italian point of view as opposed to tho Jugo-Slav and,therefore, constitutes a settlement with which the AmericanGovernment can hove nothing to do.     Tho Memorandum fromthe United States Government criticises the proposed settle-ment on four grounds.   Firstly1 j that it cedes to Italy&apos;thenarrow strip of territory running along the coast as far asthe Corpus Separatum of Fiume.   Secondly, that this strip )of territory coupled with the constitution of Fiume as aFree City under tho guarantee of the League, of Hat ions clearlypaves!
paves the Way for its annexation to Italy.,    Thirdly,, thatthe modification of tho Jugo-Slav-Italian frontier4 operatesto the detriment of Jugo-Slavia. in its eontro^, of &quot;the Northern,railway from Flume,. and, fourthly,, that it provides for thepartition of Albania.-    The Memorandum of the United&apos;State aGovernment would appear to have entirely ignored the greatadvantages- conferred oh Jugoslavia at the same time.The origin of the proposal of January 20th lies in thefact that when the Prime Ministers cf Great Britain and Francecame to deal directly both with the representatives&apos; of Italyand Jugo-Slavia in Paris thoy found that nobody desired thoconstitution cf the Freo State of Fiume which had alwaysbeen an essential part of the American proposals for settlement.They discovered that Jugo-Slavia would prefer a settlementwhioh did away with the Free State,, including as it does apopulation of 200,.000 Slavs,, and included as- much as possibleof its territory and population vrithin its own borders,.Accordingly the Governments of Franco and Great Britaincontinuing the negotiations from the point at v/hich they hadbeen left on December 7th made the proposal under dismissionincluding the rectification of tho Wilson lino and the cessionto Italy of a strip of territory running along tho shore- soas to connect it with the Freo City of Fiumer the net upshoiof which was that Jugo-Slavia was to pain, as compared withthe American proposal an additional i 0,000 Jugoslavs, whileagreeing to tho inclusion within the Italian frontier of afurther 50,000 Jugo-Slavs in addition to the 400,000 whichPresident Wilson had already agreed to allot to that country.As
&amp;s regards the suggestion that the proposal of January20th clearly paved the way for the annexation of the tcjsrn ofFiume to Italy, the French and British Governments cannotpossibly accept the implication that the guarantee of theLeague of Nations is worthless and that the ItalianGovernment has no intention of abiding by a Treaty which itenters into.   As regards the railway, the proposal ofJanuary 20th .gives to the Jugo-Slav State the control ofthe whole line -from the point where it leaves the Port ofFiume which is- under the control of the League of Nations.The railway is a&apos; commercial and not a strategic railway.Under President Wilson&apos;s proposals it is commanded byItalian guns./ According to either plan nothing could boeasier than for Italy to cut it in tho event of war.   Theydo not, therefore, see that there is substance in thiscriticism of a proposal whose real effect is to transferthe whole railway to Jugo-Slavia instead of leaving it inthe hands of the Free State of Fiume which no one desires.There remains the question of Albania.   They are gladto receive the criticism Of the Amerioan Government on thispart of their proposal.   They would point out, however, thattheir telegram of January 20th states that, &quot;the details ofthe administration of this country by Jugo-Slavia, Italy andGreece,, have yet to be elaborated and in working to this endSight will not be lost of the feelings and future interest ofthe Albanian people and every endeavour will be made to carryout the arrangements in full consultation with them.&quot;Further they ^ould point out that so far from this proposalbeing made in the interests of Italy it was made in theinterests of Jugo-Slavia.    The JUgo-Slavs pointed outthat
that though under the proposal of January 20th the Northernpart of their territory was guaranteed adequate aocoss to thesea throu, h the Port -of 2iumo, tho Southern part of Jugo-Slavia had no such access ind that the natural outlet was tobuild a line down the Drin river to tho mouth of the Boyanariver.     Tiie French and British Governments thought thatthere was force in this contention and their proposal inregard to Albania was designed to enable Jugo-Slavia,inasmuch as Albania was unable to undertake the work: foritself, to develop under international guarantee a railwayand port serving the Southern part of its territory.   Inasmuchas the Albanian people have never boon able to establish asettled Government for themselves! and as the northern partof tho population is overwhelmingly Christian and the Southernpart similarly Mohammedan, they thought it best to entrustthe responsibility for Government and development of thosetwo parts to Jugo-Slavia and Italy respectively.   Thay have,howevor, agreed that the whole of Albania should be broughtunder the mandatory system, and they believe that this willmake it possible eventually.to satisfy the aspirations ofthe Albanian people for unity and self-government.The Governments of Great Britain and France, therefore,must repeat that they find difficulty in understanding thepresent attitude of the United States Government towardsthe, proposals and thoy hope that in view of these explanationsthat Government will soe its way to reconsider its attitude.In their view thaso proposals are the natural outcome of thopolicy of the Joint Memorandum of December 9th, once, withtho consent of both parties concerned, tho idea of tho 2&apos;rao-----State
State of ifiume was/abandoned.     In view of the- absence ofthe American representatives they had no option but toattempt to settle this question by themselves,,   it is not,however, the desire of the two (Governments to force a.settle-men t which is unacceptable to the President of the UnitedStates and,they will, therefore, not attempt to insist uponits acceptance until they have heard the view of the UnitedStates Government on this dispatch.   They have confined,themselves, therefore, to asking the Jugo-Slav Governmentto give a definite answer to their iiemorandum of January20th since they must know what the attitude of that Govern-ment&apos;is.They feel bound, however, to ask the United StatesGovernment to consider the, effect of their action.     Theproposal of December 9th has fallen to the ground becausenobody now wante to set up the artificial Free State of Flume.The proposal of January 80th is objected to by the UnitedStates, which had no repzetentative at the deliberations, andwhich cannot, therefore, be in close touch with the c&amp;angesof opinion and c irournstance which have taken place sinceits Plenipotentiaries returned to America.    They cannothelp feeling that a large part of the misunderstanding isattributable to the difficulty of reaching a common under-standing in the circumstances.   How does the United StatesGovernment v&amp;ieh, to the regret of the Allies still has noPlenipotentiaries at the Conference, propose that this disputewhich prevents the reconstruction and threatens the peaceof South  astern Europe, and whose settlement is urgentlyrequired, should ever be closed?Further, the British and French   governments must pointout
out that the failure to secure an agreed settlement betweenItaly and Jugo-^lavia must leave them no oho ice but toacknowledge the validity of the Treaty of London.   They wouldrecall to the United states Government that the Treaty ofLondon was,entered into in the spring of 1915 at a mostcritical and dangerous moment of the. tear.   In thus enteringthe war on the side of human freedom Italy made it e conditionthat the Allies should secure for her as against ^ustria-Hungary strategic frontiers which would guarantee her againstthe retention by the Central Powers of the strategic commandof the Northern Plains of Italy.   Had the Austro-Hungarianremained in existence as the ally of Germany, the provisionsof the Treaty of London would have been sound.   lie lyingupon the word of her Allies Italy endured the war to theend.     She suffered a loss in killed of over 500,000 men andin wounded of three times that number, while her people areburdened by crushing debt.   It was clearly impossible forher Allies to declare at the end of the war that theirsignature rto the Treaty meant nothing but a scrap of paperand that they did not intend to apply the terms of theirbond, , They agreed with  resident Wilson that the circumstancesunder which the Treaty of London were concluded had beentransformed by the war itself. &apos; The ijistro-Hungarian Empirehad disappeared and the menace to Italy, against which theterms of the Treaty were intended to /provide, had largelydiminished.     They, therefore, entirely associated themselveswith the efforts of President Yilison to negotiate .a settlementbetween Italy and Jugo-Slavic which was more consonant withthe new conditions and which was acceptable to both sides.But throughout these negotiations they never concealed
from him the fact that they regarded themselves as boundby the Treaty of London in the event of a voluntary agreementnot/being arrived at.      Tho -fact, therefore, &apos;that when the made -their proposals of January .80th -they informed both theItalian and the Jugoslav Governments that in the svent oftheir not being accepted they would have no option, out toallow the Treaty of London to come into force, aan have comeas no surprise^ and was indeed the obvious method of bringingthis long conl.rove.rsy to a close,   ^hey would, point out&apos;&apos; -that this declaration is not.,: as the American &quot;Governmentwould if pear to think, an ultimatum to Jugoslavia on behalfof Italy.     Under the treaty of London Italy has had to-&apos; Jugo-Slayia.- :-.-This--part of; the Treaty is. as ^unacceptable toabandon fiume; altogether and hand it over to/Italians as isthe transfer of Dalrasrtia and the Islands to Jiigo^Slavia%     The&quot;declaration, therefore, in regard, to the enforcement of theTreaty was an attempt to&apos;promote a prompt&apos;settlement of thisdangerous cenntroversy by pointing out to both sides that ifthey could not agree up Oh a settlement which after longnegotiation&apos;seemed to be a fair compromise&apos;between theirooafiicting views, the Only alternative was an arragemejatwhich was less palatable to both.Finally, the Governments of France and Great Britainfeal .koun&amp; to reply to the general observations&apos;containedin the latter part of the United otates Memorandum..-&apos;    Theyiajow well the sincerity .qf President Wilson&apos;&apos;s desire forthe establishment of a better international order providingreal guarantees against a repetition of the terrible eventsof the last five years.     They are reluctant to believethat the President can consider that the modificationswhich
which they have made in the Memorandum of December 9th, canconstitute in themselves a justification for a withdrawalfrom all further co-operation with them in the attempt toadjust peaceably the world&apos;s affairs.     They feel confidentthat the explanations contained in this reply will removeany misunderstandings as to the nature of the Adriatic 1proposals.     s.t the same time they are deeply concernedthat the United titates should even contemplate the actionto which they refer.     One of the principal difficultiesencountered by the heads of Governments during the negotiationsof peace was that of reconciling Treaty obligations withnational aspirations which had changed or come into beingsince the date on which the Treaties were signed.     It wasobviously impossible to ignore these latter aspirations,   manyof them born during the war, and formulated with unexampledclarity and elevation by the President of the United Stateshimself.     It was equally clearly impossible to ignore Treatiesin fact the war began in order to enforce upon Germany respectfor the solemn Treaty she had made nearly 80 years beforein regard to the neutrality of Belgium.     It is the taskof the statesmen of the world to endeavour to adjust nationalaspirations and ideals;    many of whic L are only transitoryand ephermeral with one another and with international Treaties.The difficulty of the task, the patience required in orderto effect it successfully, the uselessness of endeavouringto enforce pre-conceiyed ideas on refractory material hasbeen recognised by no one more fl^-sarly than by the Presidentof the United states. ,   In his address at the opening session ,of the Peace Conference he pointed out how impossible ifwas to expect imperfect human beings and imperfect nationsto
to agree at once upon ideal solutions.     He mada it clearthat in his judgment the only course before the Peace Oon-ference was to do the best it could in the circumstancesand to create machinery whereby improvements and rectificationscould be &quot;effected by reason and common sense under theauthority of the League of Nations instead of by resortto war,    Accordingly not only was the League of -Nationsestablished, but article II was specially inserted in theCovenant.providing that &quot;the Assembly may from time to timaadvise the reconsideration by members of the League ofTreaties which become inapplicable and the considerationof international conditions whose continuance might entegerthe peace of the world&quot;.   Thus, an essential part of theTreaties of Peace has been the constitution of machineryfor modifying and correcting these Treaties themselves, whereexperience shows it to be necessary.     The Governments ofFrance and Great Britain, therefore, view with consternationthe threat of the United States Government to withdraw fromthe comity of Nations because it does not agree with theprecise terms of the Adriatic settlement.     The difficultyof reconciling ethnographic with other considerations iscertainly not greater in the Adriatic case and does notproduce more anomalous results than in the case of other partsof the general Treaties of peace* difficulties which wererecognised by President Wilson and his colleagues when theyagreed to the best settlement practicable&apos; at the time, becausethe machinery for peaceful readjustment had come into being.That ethnographic reasons cannot be the only ones to be takeninto account is clearly shown by the inclsuion of 3,OOO,DCGGe rmans
2 ft) 1.Germans in Czecho-Slovakia, and the proposals so activelysupported by the, United States Delegation for the inclusionwithin Poland of great fiuthenian majorities exceeding3,500,000 in number, hostile to Polish rule,     Though theBritish representatives saw serious objections to thisarrangement the British Government have not thought tnemselvesjustified in reconsidering on that account their membershipof the league of Nations.     The Governments of France andGreat Britain, therefore, earnestly trust that whatever thefinal view of the United states Government as to the Adriaticsettlement may be, they will not wreck the whoilie machineryfor dealing with international disputes by withdrawing fromthe Treaties of 1919 beesuse their view is not adapted inthis particular case.     That would be to destroy the hopesnow entertained by countless millions of people all overthe world that the most enduring and the meet beneficentpart of the Treaty of peace was the constitution of machinerywhereby the defects of Treaties could be remedied and thechanging conditions and aspirations of mankind could beadjusted by processes of reason and justice instead of bythe balancing of armaments and resort to war.    The Government..of Great Britain and France cannot believe that it is theapurpose of the American people to take/step as far-reachingand terrible in its effects on a ground vfoioh has theappearance of being so inadequate.(Signed) Millerand.&quot;       i).
