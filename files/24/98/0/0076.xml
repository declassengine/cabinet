This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.SECRET.21THE CABINET.SHIPPING   REQUIRED   FOR   THE   REPATRIATION   OFTROOPS FROM BATOUM, EGYPT AND THE BLACK SEA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to my colleagues the following memorandum by the General Staff on _0149the urgent necessity for shipping to effect the withdrawal from Batoum and to 8b,J&apos;repatriate troops due for demobilization from Egypt and the Black Sea.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The Wae Office,IBth February, 1920.1. The Army Council note with concern that pressing calls are being made uponthe Government to undertake the evacuation of large numbers of Russian refugeesfrom Novorossisk, Odessa and elsewhere, who are fleeing before the advance of theBolshevik forces.2. It appears almost inevitable that if these calls are acceded to, the amount ofshipping which will be required to carry them into effect will seriously delay not onlythe withdrawal of the British garrison now at Batoum, but also the repatriation ofdemobilizable personnel from Egypt and from the Black Sea.3. The withdrawal from Batoum is an urgent matter which for two reasons cannotbe postponed. In the first place the complete collapse of Denikin&apos;s troops, which mayoccur at any moment, would leave the British detachment at Batoum directly exposedto immediate attack by Bolshevik forces. The Cabinet have decided that &quot; there canbe no question of making active war on the Bolsheviks.&quot; (Cabinet 7 (20) (1).)The removal of these troops is therefore imperative if we are to avoid an entanglementwhich would completely nullify the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In the second place, an increase to General Milne&apos;s forces in the neighbourhood ofConstantinople is an immediate necessity, as there is every reason to anticipate gravedisturbances there on. or in anticipation of, the publication of the terms of peace. Onthe other hand, General Franchet d&apos;Espp.rey is taking advantage of every pretext toremove French battalions from General Milne&apos;s command, in order that the latter maybe forced to apply to him for assistance should disturbances arise, witli which GeneralMilne&apos;s force is not strong enough to deal. General Franchet d&apos;Esperey has plainly,intimated that if he receives any such appeal he will take direct control of theoperations himself, which implies that the command at Constantinople will pass fromBritish to French hands. The Cabinet have already made it clear that any such,measure will be unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Orders have accordinglybeen issued to General Milne to concentrate the Batoum garrison in the vicinity ofConstantinople forthwith.4. As regards demobilization, the following numbers have to be brought home bythe end of March : Officers.     Other ranks.Black Sea    ............      1,000 5,207Egypt.........      ...      2,000       22,768It is essential that this repatriation should be punctually carried out in order tofulfil the pledges that have been given, and it should therefore take precedence of theremoval of refugees from South Russia.(B2O/107)  100 2/20  HAS  79C(5wo
General Staff,6th February, 1920.5. It is understood from the Ministry of Shipping that there is no prospect ofincreasing the number of ships at present in the Black Sea and, therefore, any measurestaken to evacuate Russian refugees must clash both with movement of the Batoumdetachment in Constantinople and our demobilization.The Army Council therefore ask that the Cabinet will authorize the Ministry ofShipping to give precedence to vital British interests in these two cases.
