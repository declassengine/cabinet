Mr. Longhurst *This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.CONFIDENTIAL9 21THE CABINET.PROVISION OF STORES FOR THE SERVICEDEPARTMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum on the question of_the provision of stores for the Service Departments, which was discussed at the ^eDCabinet Conference of the 9th December, 1919. 2;I concur in the views set forth in the memorandum, and in ,the scheme for aco-ordinating committee proposed therein, which has many advantages over anyproposals which were put before the Cabinet Conference.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,Uth February, 1920.i. It has been assumed that the conclusions of the Cabinet Conference imply : (a.) That storage of bulk stocks and reserves must remain with the fightingdepartment which uses them.(b.) That each using department must be responsible for distribution or issue ofstores whether in bulk or in detail.(c.) That specification and design must rest with the using department.oLists of stock commodities and standardized articles in use by the WarDepartment and common to other fighting departments have been forwarded to theMinistry of Munitions with an explanatory letter as directed in paragraph 4 (6) of theconclusions of the Cabinet Conference held on 9th December, 1919. A. copy of theexplanatory letter is attached as Appendix A.3. These lists do not include arms and ammunition or technical war stores in regardto which exact conformity with specification or any minor fault would involve questionsof life and death, and therefore responsibility for all necessary inspection could not bedelegated to any department other than the using department or another fightingdepartment with similar responsibilities.4. The lists do, however, include stores, which, though standard commodities, arethe subject of purchase from the fighting department by members of the service, suchas boots.The lists also include standard commodities required for the War Department,which though different in type from those in use by other fighting departments aresimilar in character.5. It is considered that the War Department cannot divest itself of responsibilityfor the quality of stores of any kind which it holds or issues to troops, or for rejectingstores, however purchased, which do not come up to requirements.The lists are divided therefore into two parts : A. Stores where conformity with specification can probably be sufficiently insuredby a central purchasing department, subject only to test inspection by theWar department.B. Stores where, owing either to the importance of exact conformity withspecification or the difficulty in delegating to another department thedecision of passing stores&quot; slightly varying from specification, the supervisionof inspection by the War Department would have to be closer and moredirect.(B20/86)   100  2/20   H&amp;S  7928vro
6. It may be useful to turn to the more general issue raised in the course of thediscussion recorded in the minutes of the Cabinet Conference.The advantages which it is hoped to gain from a Central Purchase Agency may bebriefly summarized as follows : (i.) Avoidance of competition  particularly in a large war between fightingdepartments and economy of man-power by central control of production,(ii.) Avoidance of purchase by one department of stores of which there is a surplusin another department,(iii.) Improvement and economy of provision by central buying of common tradearticles.(iv.) Modification of demands so as to eliminate unessential departure from tradepatterns.7. The main stumbling block in any scheme of centralized purchase must befrankly faced and recognized. It is impossible to take away from the fighting servicesthe function of issue of stores. They must train the personnel for this work. Theissuers must know the name, designation, and a hundred and one details if they are tocarry out this task intelligently. Any attempt to lay down that a Supply Ministrywould hold stocks would only result in disaster.It would be found in practice that duplication of stocks w7ould develop, as thefighting services would always be on the safe side against emergency demands, andwould not feel easy in their minds unless they knew immediately where to lay theirhands upon their requirements if sudden demands were made upon them. They cannotbe blamed for that attitude organization is the power to foresee. On whatever scaleexpenditure is approved, it is the duty of the fighting services to be prepared withinsuch limits. No fighting department could allow its authorized reserves to be mixedup with other stocks in the hands of an independent department.Parliament fixes a very definite and centralized responsibility on each fightingdepartment in this matter, and a formal certificate has to be given annually that theauthorized reserves are complete. This applies as much to standardized stores as totechnical supplies-using the term standardized store to mean a stock \ commodity usedby more than one department of State. If a store is only bought by one department,no good can result from its purchase by an intermediary.8. There are further the considerable financial difficulties which would be involvedin purchase by a department which is not a user of stores which would be charged toanother department which is a user.These difficulties were much in evidence in the case of the Ministry of Munitionsduring the war. Then financial criticism and scrutiny were necessarily relaxed andpublic attention distracted by the vicissitudes of the war.9. The main argument for a Ministry of Supply is to secure the benefits ofco-ordinated purchase. Surely this can be achieved without the expense or thecircumlocutary methods inseparable from the purchase through another Ministry, withall the unnecessary duplication of inspection and the separation of design and research.10. It is suggested, therefore, that instead of the somewhat elaborate schemeforeshadowed in the minutes of the Cabinet Conference, it would be wiser to see if aless pretentious arrangement cannot be devised which, while securing the objectsoutlined in paragraph U, will avoid the more obvious disadvantages of this schemeSuch an arrangement can be found in the development of the system, whichwas in its embryo before the war, of co-ordinating the purchases of the fightingdepartments by means of a central committee formed of representatives of thepurchasing branches of each department.11. The scheme which is proposed is as follows: (a.) An authoritative co-ordinating committee should be established and composedof representatives from each of the fighting departments. The chairman ofthe committee would be appointed by the Cabinet.(b.) The function of the committee would be to see that where co-ordinateddemands can procure a better price, or where elimination of conflictingdemands will ensure a better supply, the arrangements to these ends arecarried out.(c.) The committee would also suggest modifications in pattern so as to eliminateunessential details.
(d.) No large purchases would be made by any fighting department in the normalcourse without consultation with the committee,(e.) The committee would prepare a report periodically, and not less than once ayear, which would be submitted to the Prime Minister and copies to theMinisters concerned.12. The scheme proposed will meet all requirements in normal times of peace.In the case of a war of comparatively minor magnitude, such as the South AfricanWar, the committee proposed would, it is thought, prove of great value andadequately fulfil all the objects desired.In the case of a war of the first magnitude, such as the recent conflict, theorganization proposed would be a useful framework upon which, with the addition ofthe provision branches of the fighting services, a Ministry of Supply could withoutdislocation be built up.13. It is suggested that the arrangements are businesslike and would proveeconomical and very popular with the general public. The proposals would notinvolve any appreciable increase in officials, and at the same time they would enablethe Ministry of Munitions to be demobilized much earlier.14. Finally, as the provision work of the fighting departments is unlikely to beconsiderable for the next 3 years, except for consumable stores, the committee wouldhave time to get into their stride, and provision branches of the departments concernedcould adapt themselves by the time that the volume of work begins to increase. Thearrangement would answer the objection that it is undesirable to hasten into the creationof a large new department at the time when the provision work which has to be doneis at its lowest. The arrangement proposed would not require legislation, andthis may at the moment be considered an advantage.APPENDIX A.Correspondence with, Ministry of Munitions referred to in paragraph 2.I/Gen. No./2557.  (C. 1.)War Office,9th February, 1920.Sir,I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to paragraph (b) of the conclusions of the CabinetConference held on 9th December last, which was as follows: &quot;That the fighting- departments should draw up lists of stock commodities and standardisedarticles which might with advantage be the subject of common purchase and manufacture, and shouldforward the same to the Minister of Munitions, who undertook to make- further proposals afterconsultation with the First Commissioner of Works.&quot;I am accordingly to transmit herewith the enclosed lists of stores, together with an explanatorymemorandum, for Lord Inverforth&apos;s consideration.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)     H. J. C REEDY.The Secretary,Ministry of Munitions.Explanatory Communication to accompany Lists of Stock Commodities and Standardized Articlessent by the war office to the &quot;ministry of munitions. &apos;1. Lists of stock commodities and standardized articles used by the War Department and common toother fighting departments are forwarded and enclosed in accordance with the direction in paragraph 2 ofthe conclusion of Cabinet Conference of the 9th December, 1919.These lists include stores required by the War Department which, though similar in character to thosein use by other departments, are invariably different in type.2. It has been assumed that the Cabinet deeision implies : (a.) That storage of bulk stocks and reserves must remain with the fighting department which usesthem.(J.) That each using department must be responsible for distribution or issue of stores, whether inbulk or detail.(c.) That specification and design must rest with the using department.On this basis it is considered that circumstances might arise in which these stores &quot;might withadvantage be the subject of common purchase and manufacture,&quot; provided that the fighting departmentmay rely that the Central Purchasing and Manufacturing Agency would pass no stores which did not comedp to the specification fixed by the lighting departments.(7928)
3. The lists are divided into two parts ; Stores contained in Part A are those where conformity with specification can probably be sufficientlyinsured by a central purchasing department, subject only to test inspection by the WarDepartment.Stores contained in Part B are those where owing either to the importance of exact conformity withspecification or the difficulty in delegating to another department the decision of passing storesslightly varying from specification, the supervision of inspection by the War Department wouldhave to be closer and more direct.4. The War Department are sending a memorandum to the Cabinet outlining a scheme for co-ordinationof purchases for the fighting departments which they consider may meet the objects in view and render theorganization of a separate department for this purpose unnecessary.It is thought that it may be convenient for the Ministry of Munitions to understand the view taken bythe War Department in order that expenditure may not be incurred by them in building up administrativemachinery which may eventually prove unnecessary.Lists ok War Department Stock Commodities and Standardized Articles which might bk thesubject ov General Purchase.A.Stores, which if centrally purchased, would require only test inspection by the War Department, inaddition to inspection by the purchasing department.1.
