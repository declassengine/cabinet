P-lfJHnrMTi * i-^^-^^^^ --      uuNrfotNT ALINTERALLIED INDEBTEDNESS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I fear that the course Buggeated by the Treasuryin CP. 584 might be regarded by America as an attemptto force her hand.    This I think she would resent.The result might well be that she would cancel theloans to the Allies and not cancel the loans to us.If we cancelled our loans to France, and Americafollowed suit and at the same time, we retained theburden of our debt to America (which can be regardedas assumed mainly on account of French needs and notof our own), ten years hence France might be in astronger economic position than this country.   France&apos;sclaims on Germany may,I think quite likely will,materialise into something considerably more thanseems to be expected at the present moment, and itmust be remembered that her business people have notbeen drained by war taxation as our business peoplehave been.The present seems to me to be a very bad time tocome to a decision on a big question of this kind aswe are too near to events to have them sufficiently inperspective to enable a sound judgment to be formed.There is a tendency, for everybody to oscillate fromone extreme to another in forming an, opinion.   Also,knowing something of American business men&apos;s presentoutlook, I should say that this is a particularly badtime to force the matter on the United States.The question whether it would not be a good thingto cancel all international debts between AlliedGovernments is totally different.     It seems prettycertain that we should gain from this, but it must notbe assumed that the adoption of the Treasury^ sugges*tion would lead to this end.     In fact it is a gambleand the position in my opinion is too serious to besettled in such a way,A. C. GEDDES.12th February, 1920.
