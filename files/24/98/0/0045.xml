MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.NAVY ESTIMATES AND NAVAL POLICY.1. NAVY ESTIMATES.The Sketch Navy Estimates for 1920-21 have now been carefully examined, and the net amount forwhich the Board of Admiralty fiud it necessary to ask is 84 millions.&apos;This total provides for (a) the maintenance during 1920-21 of a Fleet of the minimum strength which can be regarded asproviding in present circumstances for the security of the Empire, but without any allowancejor starting any netv programme of construction. This Naval Force is, except in minordetails, identical with that shown in the Appendix to the Admiralty Memorandum of24th October on Naval Policy and Expenditure :(b) the liquidation of the terminal expenses of the War, which, as in the case of the Army, consist ofexpenditure already incurred or to which we are committed :(c) expenditure of an abnormal or a quasi-war character, arising out of temporary obligations, i.e.,Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea.The amount included for (a) the maintenance of the minimum Naval Force which may be regardedas representing normal naval expenditure, apart from provision for New Construction, is 62^ millions.The rough estimate under this head, in the Admiralty Memorandum of 24th October, was between 58and 59 millions. Since that date there has been a further rise in price of essential supplies, as, for instance,oil-fuel, clothing, provisions, and medicines, and there has also been a further war bonus granted to allindustrial workers and civilian employees of the State generally.It is estimated that during 1920-21 we shall be living on surplus stocks to the extent of i\ millions,which ought to be added to the above figure of 62^ millions in order to arrive at what would have been thetotal requirement under (a) iu a uormal year, apart from New Construction.Admiralty experience entirely bears out the calculation of the War Office that the cost of all mainitems of maintenance is now roughly 2\ times the pre-war cost, and the following figures are therefore ofinterest: Net total of Navy Estimates, 1914-15,  51,550,000, less  15,300,030 provided for         New Construction..........&apos; -      -   36,250,000Multiply by 2\, to obtain equivalent in present purchasing power .... 90,625,000Actual net amount asked for by the Admiralty under (a)       -      -      -      - 62,500,000Even when the large increase in Appropriations in Aid in 1920-21 and the surplus stocks drawn uponhave been taken into account, the Admiralty estimate is some 17 millions less than the Pre-war Fleet wouldhave cost, judged by the above rough standard.The amount included for (b) the terminal expenses of the War is 21 millions.The rough estimate made in the Admiralty Memorandum of 24th October was from 16 to 17 millions,including between 4 millions and 5 millions for Separation Allowances. This rough estimate has beenexceeded, chiefly owing to the following causes :  -   &apos;Greater expense in connection with the reconditioning of Hired Vessels.Greater expense in connection with compensation for loss or for repair of vessels lost or damagedthrough War risks.Reimbursement of expenses incurred by Neutral Countries in the Internment of Officers and Men.Further, the October figure was framed on the assumption (which the Admiralty warned the Cabinetcould not be actually fulfilled) that we could start the year 1920-21 without a single Officer or Man surplusto the requirements of the reduced Fleet. Similarly, it assumed that Dockyard men surplus to Navalrequirements could be discharged during the winter.   (Both these subjects are referred to again later.)The amount included for (c) abnormal and quasi-war charges is not more than half a million.It has beeu assumed that these special causes of expenditure will cease to operate after the first six monthsof the new Financial Year.Naval Personnel.The Cabinet always attach great importance to the numbers proposed to be included in Vote A, sincethe influence of these numbers permeates many of the chief Navy Votes.It will be remembered that, at the meeting of the Finance Committee of the Cabinet on 24th November,it was stated that the numbers at that date stood at 157,000, but that they were being reduced as rapidly aspossible, and that it was hoped that they would not exceed 144,000 by 31st March 1920; also that thereduced Fleet proposed by the Admiralty for 1920-21 required approximately 126,000 men to man it.The actual numbers that will be borne on 31st March next are now estimated as 136,000, as against theabove forecast of 144,000, and during 1920-21 it is estimated to reduce these to 131,137.These figures assume that approval will be given at a very early date to the Retirement Scheme forsurplus Officers which has been before the Treasury since December, and that the estimate of the number ofmen that accept free discharge will prove correct.* Note.-This figure is subject to tho usual minor adjustments when the votes are submitted to the Treasury in detail.O  (33) AS 7079  Pic        80  2/20  E &amp; S
In conclusion, I should like to make it clear that, for this expenditure of 62^ millions, the Admiraltywill be maintaining a reduced but an efficient Navy, ready to undertake any duty on the sea and to upholdthe honour and interests of the Empire in any part of the world. In this respect I am in a happierposition than the Secretary of State for War, who reports that this is &quot; the year when the expense of the&quot; peace-time British Army will be at its highest and the results at their very lowest.&quot; And surely it iswell for the country that this should not be true simultaneously both of the Navy and the Army. TheCabinet are well aware how constant, various, and unexpected are the calls that are made upon the Navyall over the world, even in periods of profound peace. At a time when our Army is admittedly in a stateof transition, we cannot afford to have any doubt as to the vitality and strength of the Navy.3. NAVAL POLICY.I feel that it would be most difficult for the Government to present the Navy Estimates for 1920-21without a definite statement being made as to their Naval Policy, and I ask, therefore, for a clearpronouncement on the subject.The views of the Board of Admiralty were placed before the Cabinet in the Admiralty Memorandumof the 24th October.In that Memorandum it was pointed out by the Admiralty that it was vital to the British Empire thather sea supremacy should not be sacrificed, and that if the United States could not be induced to abandonor modify their 1916 programme, efforts would have to be made to undertake the construction required tocounterbalance it.After consideration of this Memorandum the Prime Minister sent a telegram to Lord Grey atWashington, pointing out that Great Britain had no desire to enter into naval competition with the United. States, but could not afford to ignore what they were doing, and requesting information on certain points.Lord Grey&apos;s reply (dated L&apos;7th November last) to this telegram contained the following passage : &quot;It is undesirable to make official enquiries of United States administration as to their prospect ofnaval expenditure, for (1) they would probably decline further information : (2) information, if given,would be (? unreliable), as friction between administration and Congress and illness of Presidentprevent any (? settled) policy in any Government Department.&quot; 1 am convinced that best course for us is to produce moderate Navy Estimates, as stated to mein London in September, in expectation that example set by us will be followed here. Attemptto strike a bargain with Americans in advance about Navy Estimates will probably have contraryeffect and stimulate agitation for biggest-in-tho-world Navy. For the moment we have situation in&apos; hand, as United States Navy cannot from its present condition be raised to a really efficient state forat least a year.&quot;The Admiralty&apos;s revised estimate for the personnel required for the reduced Fleet is 127,511, and thedifference between this figure and the 131,137 is made up of 950 Officers and 2,676 Men surplus torequirements, whom it will probably not be possible to dispose of under any Reduction Scheme between tbe1st April 1920 and 31st March 1921.1 should like to lay stress on the difficulty of suddenly effecting large decreases or increases in NavalPersonnel, for which reason I maintain that the reduction of over 25,000 Officers and Men in the 17 monthsfrom last November to April 1921 will, if accomplished as we hope, be a remarkable feat. It must beremembered that the crew of a ship is made up of numerous small groups of individuals of many trades Gunnery ratings Torpedo ratings-Engine Room ratings Signal ratings Electricians Armourers Mechanics of many kinds, and so on, each group possessing entirely distinct qualifications and having anentirely distinct duty, but each absolutely essential to the fighting efficiency of the ship. In every adjustmentof naval personnel, provision has to be made for each of these numerous branches of skilled men to be kept upto strength in every ship all over the world. Therefore, you cannot wash out naval personnel with a broadbrush. If you proceed to do so, you at once immobilise far more units of the Fleet than you ever intended.That this is so has been proved in the case of the U.S.A., where Mr. Daniels has recently reported to Congressthat, owing to the uncontrolled operation of discharge of men, the U.S. Navy, with a personnel of 102,000 onits pay books, has an effective naval force of only 45,000.Dockyard Numbers.At the time when the Admiralty Memorandum of 24th October was written, we expected to start theyear 1920-21 with 51,000 men in the Dockyards. Owiug to the menace of unemployment and the wiih-drawal of the Donation, the Cabinet approved of repair work being brought forward so as to reduce dischargesduring the winter to a minimum. Consequently, we shall start the new Financial Year with 55,600 men inthe Dockyards instead of 51,000. The actual programme of naval work in the Yards in 1920-21 will onlyrequire approximately 41,500 men to be borne. If the policy recommended by Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committeeis carried out to the extent of laying down two Oilers in the Dockyards this spring (and I do not see howthe Government can reject that policy, whether the Oilers be for private order as contemplated by LordColwyn, or for Fleet use as now suggested by the Chancellor of Exchequer)-this will give employment toan additional 2,000 men out of the surplus number now borne, and other Repayment Services will providework for another 1,500 men. Therefore, our Estimates involve Dockyard numbers being reduced from$5,600 to 45,000 in the early part of 1920-21. It is right to warn the Cabinet that such heavy dischargeswill cause great concert), and that the policy is certain to be challenged. But any modification in it can bejustified only on national, not on naval, grounds, and the expense involved by any such modification must beconsidered separately and can find no place in the Admiralty statement of the money required for the actualservice of the Navy.It may be asked how it is that whilst our Dockyard numbers before the War were about 42,000, wenow require as many as 41,500 men in the Y^ards for the service of the Fleet apart from any New Construc-tion programme. The answer is that the main work of the Royal Dockyards has always been repair work.The great bulk of the work of New Construction was always carried out in Contract Yards and affordedpractically constant employment for about 47,000 men. This number has now come down to very small pro-poitions indeed, and it may be said that we shall shortly have discharged our Shipbuilding Contractorsand their 47,000 men.   The repair Avork of the Dockyards, on the other hand, is practically not affected.
The reference in the last sentence is to the serious position recently disclosed in regard to the U.S. Navalpersonnel. The Secretary of the U.S. Navy, in his letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, datedthe 20th December last, admits that, whereas the personnel voted is over 170,000, the actual numbers enlistedare only 102,000, and that the shortage of skilled men is so great that their numbers are only proportionatefor a Navy of 45,000. This shortage, however, is ascribed by Mr. Daniels entirely to the delay inapproving his scheme for increases of pay, and he definitely states that he &quot; believes many thousands would&quot; return to the Navy should Congress take favourable action along the lines of increased pay as recommended&quot; by me.&quot;Other information that has reached me confirms this view that the enlistment of men is merely a matterof paying sufficiently high rates, and I am of opinion that the present circumstances do not in any wayjustify the expectation that the U.S.A. will be unable to man the great Fleet that they are building.On the contrary, since the Admiralty Memorandum was put forward, recent estimates have beenintroduced in the United States which indicate a further increase of 2 Battleships and 1 Battle Cruiser overand above the original 1916 programme.With these facts before them the Board of Admiralty have again considered the question of NavalPolicy, and especially the means by which we can ensure maintaining our sea supremacy.It appears to the Admiralty that there are really only two solutions open to us: (a) For a definite approach to be made by the British Government, when a suitable opportunityoccurs, to the Government of the United States with a view to a limitation of their NavalArmaments on the basis of equality in Naval material :(b) Ourselves to embark on a further building programme which will ensure that we are at leastequal in material strength to the United States Navy as at present bu Igeted for.The Board do not overlook the fact that at the present moment we have an Alliance with the thirdgreat Naval Power, Japan. This comes to an end in 1921, and if it were renewed on a general offensiveand defensive basis, instead of on its present limited and local basis, then we might view with equanimitythe naval expansion of the United States. But it is almost inconceivable for the British Empire toconsider in the future an Alliance with Japan on a basis which can only have for its object protectionagainst the United States.From motives of economy, therefore, but also from the far mightier motive of a union between theEnglish-speaking nations of the World, it seems inevitable that our whole political Naval Policy should bedirected towards an Allianccor an Entente with the United States, as a result of which the British Empireand the United States should be able to advance hand in hand in their peaceful avocations, increasinghappiness, contentment, and prosperity.An Alliance or an Entente with the United States based on equality in Naval Material is, in fact,required to reach the ideals we each aim at.If such an understanding is politically not possible it remains for this Empire to preserve its sea powerand take the necessary steps vital to its existence. It Will then be necessary definitely to lay down that aone-power standard against the strongest naval power is the minimum standard compatible with our vastsea requirements, and that the British building programme in all types of vessels must be such that thisone-power standard is fully maintained.If the above represents the policy of the Government, I am sure that it can be indicated to Parliamentin a way that will not prejudice our relations with the U.S.A., nor lay us open to the charge of enteringinto a building competition with them.The Navy Estimates that I am submitting, with their entire absence of provision for any new buildingprogramme and their great reduction of pre-war personuel, amply carry out Lord Grey&apos;s suggestion in tholast paragraph of his telegram.In introducing them I should propose to say that the Naval Policies of all past Governments, which-ever party they represented, have at least included this principle, that our Navy should not be inferior instrength to the Navy of any other Power, and that the present Government adheres to this principle ; thatwe are fortunate now in that the only Navy approximating in strength to our own is that of the U.S.A.,with whom we are associated in such a way that the idea of competition in armaments between us isone that is repugnant to us all; and that we hope and believe that if there is any emulation between us itis likely to be in the direction of reducing that ample margin of naval strength which we each alikepossess over all other navies.W.
