This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET. (THE CABINET.SUPPLY OF FLOUR AND COAL TO NORTH RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate to my colleagues the following Memorandum prepared by the GeneralStaff, on which a Cabinet decision is required as to the despatch of flour and coal toNorth Russia.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War, Office,13th February, 1920.MEMORANDUM BY THE GENERAL STAFF.1. On the completion of the evacuation of North Russia by the Allied troops,General Lord Rawlinson reported that he had left the North Russian Governmentin a position to maintain itself and carry on a successful defence against the Bolsheviks,provided it made proper and economical use of the resources at its disposal. Heconsidered that these resources were just adequate, and that no further assistance fromus was absolutely necessary, except in one particular namely, food for Murmansk.Lord Rawlinson agreed with the Russians that the food situation at Murmansk was notsatisfactory, and recommended strongly that a shipload of flour of not less than6,000 tons should be sent there about Christmas. 1919, to enable the civil populationand troops to be fed during the winter.2. Lord Rawlinson&apos;s recommendation was considered by the War Cabinet on22nd October, 1919, and it was decided that the Secretary of State for War shouldmake enquiries as to the possibility of sending a shipload of foodstuffs to Murmanskfrom the area occupied by General Denikin (W.C. 633, 22nd Octoter. 1919). As aresult of these enquiries it was found that General Denikin could provide the 6,000 tonsof cereals, but that he was unable to ship it.3. It was, therefore, arranged that the flour required should be provided from Britishsources on condition that General Denikin supplied an equivalent quantity to be sent toEgypt in compensation. The Treasury, who were notified by the Wheat Commissionof the proposed course of action, replied that they were not prepared to authorize thedespatch of this flour to Murmansk until the wheat or flour which General Denikin hadundertaken to supply for shipment to Egypt was actually being loaded. In con-sequence of this it was decided that the s.s. &quot;Polglass Castle,&quot; carrying flour en routefrom North America to the United Kingdom, which it had been, intended to divert toMurmansk, must unload her cargo in this country.4. The change in the situation in South Russia has made it most improbable thatGeneral Denikin will be able to carry out his part of the bargain immediately. Allstocks of flour are likely to be needed to feed the vast numbers of refugees who arestreaming southwards, and even if there is any flour available for other purposes, thecongestion on the railways and at the ports will certainly delay its shipment for aconsiderable period.5. It is quite clear that a shipload of at least 6,000 tons of flour is urgently neededat Murmansk. If it is not sent a large proportion of the inhabitants will be reduced tostarvation. The conditions produced will soon bring about the collapse of the RussianAdministration, and result in the whole Murmansk, region falling into the hands of theBolsheviks.6. No promise that this flour would be sent to Murmansk has, of course, everbeenmade to the Russians. But before Lord Rawlinson left North Russia, and, subsequently,whenever their representatives have enquired as to the progress being made in thismatter, they have always been led. to believe that there was some prospect of the flour(B20/82)   100  2/20  h&amp;s  7908wo
being forthcoming. Consequently, as in all these months, we have never definitelyrefused to arrange for the provision of this food, we have to some extent become morallybound to supply it. And whether this is so or not, we may be quite sure that, if wedo not send the flour now, the Russians will consider that we have not dealt fairlywith them.7. A point to be borne in mind is the effect of our action, or inaction, on theultimate situation which may arise in consequence of the recent decisiou of the SupremeCouncil to open trade relations with Russia. Whether in possession of the Bolsheviksor the anti-Bolsheviks, the Murmansk region (including the ice-free port of Murmanskand the summer ports of the White. Sea) offers great potentialities for barter trade intimber and it is consequently of importance to secure the existence, to say nothing ofthe good-will, of the inhabitants.8. In view of the urgency of the case the only satisfactory way of ensuring thatthe flour arrives in time to be of any use is to despatch it to Murmansk by the firstship which can be obtained, the question of its repayment by Denikin being postponedin the hope that the situation in South Russia may become more stable. A decision isrequired as to whether this course should be adopted, or whether the presentarrangement must hold good, by which no steps can be taken to despatch the flouruntil an equivalent quantity has been actually handed over by General Denikin. -9. The situation in North Russia with regard to coal has also become very serious.General Miller, the Russian Governor-General at Archangel, telegraphed on28th January, that owing to the shortage of coal it had been necessary to put a stopto the import of food into the country and the passage of the icebreakers. He pointedout the position had become critical, and that unless coal could be obtained it would beimpossible to continue fighting or maintain order among the population.10. In September, 1919, the Russians estimated that they would require60,000 tons of coal in North Russia during the winter. Lord Rawlinson made it clearthat there was no prospect of this being supplied from British sources and General Millerhoped to obtain this from America for which purpose he entered into negotiations withthe United States Government. His efforts in this direction have evidently provedunsuccessful. Consequently it appears that unless supplies of coal are forthcomingfrom some source any other efforts made to assist the Russians to maintain themselveswill be wasted.General Staff,War Office.
