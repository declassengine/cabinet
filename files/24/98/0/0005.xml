The question of the control exercised by it over the expenditureof the Local Authorities on which the State contributionautomatically depends.2.   The possibility of Becuring a larger proportionate contributionfrom the rates.3.   The postponement of further developments until the finances ofthe Country can bettor afford them.The first two of these have been under my consideration forsome time past and my conclusions on them are briefly that occasionfor (1) has not yet arisen, and that (2) is neither justifiable norpracticable.    The attached Memorandum sets out the considerationswhich appear to me relevant.As regards the third, the Cabinet may be reminded that the costof building and the shortage of teachers will suffice to arrest arapid increase in expenditure upon many important reforms presoribedor contemplated in the Act of 1918, and that tht danger before us isnot that these developments, which under the most favourable aircum-stances would take years to mature, will be unduly pressed forward,butxthat they will be postponed too long.    In my opinion, there isno item in the Government&apos;s programme for raising the social conditionof the people more immediately necessary than the improvement of ourEducational System.   Something has recently been done to bring theprovision of Elementary Education up to the level of our needs4 buta great deal remains to be accomplished in the grades above theElementary, before the Country will be in a position to develop thelatent capacity of its oitizens or even to derive commensurateadvantage from its expenditure upon the lowest grade.   I ask forauthority to give effect to the pledge of the War Cabinet of 19thSeptember, 1917, referred to in paragraph 8 of the Memorandum.   Ifully agree with the warning referred to in the Chancellors Memoran-dum that the amount of the present Government grants to UniversityEducation (which do not fall upon the Board of Education Estimates)is inadequate to our requirements.The Country will certainly not be helped to make a quiolc re-oovery from the effects of the War by holding up necessary improvementsin our national System of Education.     Ignorance is now the enemy:it is only by the eduoatlon of the democracy that we can hope to laythe foundation of social peace.(Sd). H.A.L. HSEER.10th February, 1920.
THE   GROWTH    01    EXPENDITURE   OHi EDUCATION.(Reference S.P03298c    CP.5125,1. The Treasury memorandum attached to the Note of thnChancellor Cf the Exchequer of  7th January * 1920 (0*2*512)Is based raainly on my memorandum 329 of December 191?;   and,though it requires correction in oertain respects, I io notpropose to traverse it in detail,,2* I think that the growth of expenditure since 1913-14,so far as it has at present gone, is indubitably du^ to thedevaluation&apos; of money, especially in respect of teachers1salaries, the expenditure on which in 1913-14 accounted for58 por cent, of the total expenditure of Local EducationAuthorities, and in 1919-23 for 54 per cent,     I shall referto this point regain,   tto far as things hare gone&apos; at present,the effects of the educational policy embodied in the Aot of1918 have not shown themselves,,38 It is quite true that the growth of educational expend-iture will depend on the policy of the Gcvornmant.     Thatpolicy was clearly declared in 1918, and it was recognisedthat the full development of an effective system of nationaleducation was essential to the national welfare.     The Act of1*948 was carried by the force of public opinion, quite as muchas by the conviction of i a r&quot; lament, as an essential measureof reconstruction.     No res: onsiblo leadsr of any Party in theCountry has ventured to   suggest that we should go back on thepolicy of 1915*    The unanimity of recent declarations thatthe educational policy of 1918 must be carried out as quioklyasCD -    &apos;
as possible is most striking.     I d&amp; not think that theCountry would tolerate any deliberate reversal of that policy,or any postponement of its operation.I may point cut thai the provisions of the Act of 1913v;ere largely aimed at the inadequate performance of the dutiesand exercise of the powers of Local Education Authorities,Under the -deoentralised system of administration which ischaraceristic of England, the State takes considerable risko.(The risk which it was desired to obviate in 1913 was the riskof parsimonious,&apos; short-sighted, and illiberal administration byLocal Mtostio&amp;Xuthorit ies. -   It is difficult new to reversethe attitude of the State towards Local Education Authoritiesand exhort thfrrn to be less liberal, less far-sighted, and moreparsimonious than they, with the constant fear of the rate-payers before them, are themselves disposed to be.It must not be forgotten, however, that present oiroum-stanoas rondar rapid development; &amp;nd rapid increase of cxpond-ituro in several directions impracticable,     (The cost of build-ings will for soim years at all events keep the buildingprogrammes of Local Ldu3a*ion Authorities down to the minimum.This limitation of building vrogr t mos will re-act upon theCevclopmcnt of Central oihools and Nursery schools, andparticularly of Oontinuition Schools, the rapid provision ofwhioh is also impeded &quot;fcy the scarcity of trained teachers.Therefore, in these respects the erst of education v.ill notrise as rajiidly as it -yould in normal times.     The main itemef inoreased expenditure fcr some ye::.rs will undoubtedly besalaries of teachers ani salaries of administrative officers.Orl
Cn the other hand, if the proposition is that develop-ments which go beyond those contemplated by the Government inthe Act of 1918, or which do not form a integral part of thereforms already announced or taken in hand, should await amore favourable condition of tho Countryrs finances, I shouldnot be disposed to contest it.   Even as regards reforms alreadyannounced and taken in hand, I recognise that the rate of theirprogress cannot be and is not being determined without regard tothe state of the public finances and to other practical con-siderations.   We shall know more about the Au fooaifries1 pro-posals when they submit their &quot;Schemes&quot; under the Act of 1918,and in criticising them we shall not overlook their financialbearings.   I do not think, however, that occasion has arisenfor taking, by new regulations, new powers of control over thetotal expenditure of Local Education Authorities.-No1 do I think that occasion has yet arisen fcr altering.&apos; . - - - - - &apos;the system of State grants so as to throw a larger bur-dan uponthe rates and a smaller burden upon the Exchequer.   The Act of1918 fixed the proportion of the Local Education Authority&apos;sexpenditure to be borne by the State at a mlmlmum of 50 per cent.It is impossible to treat this as a maximum, regard being hadparticularly to the relative poverty of certain areas.   I amdaily receiving resolutions of public bodies exhorting me tomake- education an entirely national charge on tho Exchequer.Local Education Authorities are at the present moment extremelynervous as to the burden of expenditure which they will have tocarry, at all events in the first instance in the year 1920-21,in respect of the increases in teachers1 salaries; and I havebeen pressed, and shall be pressed, to alter the system of pay-meat of grants so that when increased expenditure is incurredin any year the grants paid in that year shall be correspondinglyincreased.
I am bound, however, to refer specially ta the system ofgrants for Higher Education.   There is at present nd comprehensivegrant for Higher Education analogous to that fchich was establishedfor Elementary Education in 1917-18, on a formula which took intoaccount the educational burden of the area, its relative wealthor poverty, and its expenditure.   Until we get a comprehensivesystem of Higher Education grants, from which deductions can bemade if Local Authorities do not perform their duties or exorcisetheir powers adequately, the Scheme procedure embodies in the Acifcof 1918 will remain relatively ineffective, as regards HigherEducation.   Moreover, a gjpeat part of the grants for HigherEducation (which are largely capitation grants) do not expand inany relation to expenditure, and it has been strongly urged uponme as a grievance by a deputation from, the County Councils thatif, as is inevitable, they have to raise the salaries of teachersin Secondary Schools, - they have \v tmourity at all that their in-creased expenditure in &quot;this respect will be met by increased grant.I must remind the Cabinet that the late Government wasfully committed to a liberal policy in this respect.   In 1917I put the situation plainly before the late Chancellor of theExchequer, and told them that if the proposals in the Education-Bill, particularly those relating to Continuation Schools, wereto be made acceptable to the Country, it would be necessary tomake it clear from the beginning that the Treasury would bear alarge share of the cost.   The proportion then suggested was 75per cent.   The War Cabinet, on the 19th September 1917 (WarCabinet 236), approved t&amp;e following formula for use by me in myspeeches on the Bill, and I used it in a speech at Manchester onthe 25th September, 1917&quot;The Government feels that if these developments are&quot;to be secured within a reasonable time a large part ofthe burden
&quot;burden rust &quot;be borne by the Exchequer.   I am. not in a&quot;position to r;ive you a figure, but I am authorised to&quot;state that, in the view of the Cabinet, the development.,&quot;of Higher Education contemplated under the Bill should.&quot;bo as liberally subsidised by the Treasury      is com-&quot;patibl4.;, with, giving to the Local Education Authorities,&quot;upon &apos; whom it will devolve to administer the Act, an&quot;interest -in its prudent end economic administration.&quot;It is essential&apos;in my&apos;opinion that this pledge should be honoured..- .0n the l7th August 191c I informed Sir Henry Hibbert,Chairman of the Education Committee of the County Councils Asaooia-tion, that I hoped &quot;in due course to establish the grants forHigher Education &quot;on a. better arid more comprehensive basis&quot;.   TheCounty Councils have refused even to enter&quot; into &quot;Conference with aview to..the Establishment of. a. -Burnham Committee to consider thesalaries of tfcachers in Secondary, Technical, etc. Schools, tillthey have some -assurance.that-, the -system of grants-will be- somodified as to reflect In some degree the increased expenditurewhich will fnli on--Local-Authorities.   It is extremely desirablethat the consideration of teachers1 salaries in Secondary, etc.Schools should be undertaken at an early date;   otherwise thereis a great.denser of unduly large expenditure on -salarios ofElementary Teachers, and a danger that a proper relation betweenthe salaries of teachers in&apos;1&amp;$ Elementary Schools on the. onehand, and teachers in Secondary,, etc. Schools on the other,will not be established.     I.desire authority to give theassurance for which I am asked,     I do not propose that anyin or en a a in the Higher Educpt,ion grants should be made to. iakeieffect in 1920-21.

J?.These are certainly not extravagant.Prom the point of. view of the supply of teacherstheposition is critical, not to say alarming.   Local EducationAuthorities can do a great deal, and perhaps can do a great dealmore than hitherto, by way of recruiting teachers for theprofession;   but in the long run an adequate supply of teachersdepends upon the attractions offered by the profession toyoung.which are and for some time will he the chief item of increasedexpenditure, the- matter may be looked at from either of twopoints of view   -   that-of a reasonable living wage, andthat of the supply of teaehers.   From the first point ofview regard must be had to the devaluation of money.     TheMinistry of Labour &apos;s figures show that the&apos;general cost&apos; ofliving, including fuel,&apos; light, and clothing, as well as food,was 12^ per cent . &apos;higher on the 1st January 1920 than in 1914.This Deans that the purchasing powe*r of 4^s/- now is only equalto 20s/- in 1914.   The following table shows the pre-warequivalents of the maximum and minimum salaries recommendedby the Burnham Committee for Assistant Teachers in ElementarySchoolsPre-war equivalent Pre-war equivalent.per year. per week. .    s.    d..   *    s.    d...  Maximum:- -  ..
young persons of both sexes relatively to the attractionsoffered by other professions. The establishment of a compre-hensive State superannuation system for teachers by the SchoolTeachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, no doubt greatly improvesthose attractions ..but a good pension system without adequatesalaries during the years of service must remain relativelyineffective.The total number of entrants to the earlier stages ofthe teachin.;r profession in Elementary Schools, as bursars,student-teachers, or pupil-teachers, hag fallen from 9,614 in1908 to 5,867.     The numoer of entrants renuired to replace thenormal wastage is estimated at 9,000j   and even taking intoaccount the number of persons who entered the Elementary teachingprofession through, other channels, it is clear, that the totalnumber of entrants w,as not sufficient in any year since 1909even to replace fully the normal wastage.   On the top of thenormal wastage comes the wastage caused by the war, and thedemand for additional teachers for the extension and improvementof education in Elementary Schools.     If the improvements con-,templated by ihe Act of 1918 are to be effected within a reason-able time,&apos; probably at least an additional 3,000 teachers shouldbe forthcoming in each year far -a- period&quot; of &quot;about 15 years.It must be remembered moreover that many teachers in ElementarySchools take service in Continuation Schools, Nursery Schools,and Secondary Schools.     For the next few years the total numberof recruits for the Elementary teaching profession ought to bemore tnan double what it is now,I believe that the representatives who sat on the BurnhamCommittee were influenced to a very great extent by the feeling
that it was absolutely necessary to attract a larger number ofrecruits into the Elementary Schools, and that they could notbe attracted unless an adequate scale of salary was offered tothem.     In the Secondary and. Technical, as in the ElementarySchools, a large increase of salaries is essential if they areto attract a sufficient supply of good recruits.After all the value which -taxpayers and ratepayers receivefor their large expenditure on public education depends on theteachers.     It is not only necessary to attract many moreteachers to the Schoolsbut it is also essential to attractbetter teachers.     It would be a very short-sighted policy forthe Government to&apos; say that it would not bear its fair share&apos; i;of the improvement in the remuneration of teac&amp;ors.     Thequality of the teachers would deteriorate, and the return forthe public expenditure would be a diminishing return.I recognise on the other hand that in some areas theremay be a tendency to extravagance in the .payment of teachers.Some 53 Authorities have already voluntarily adopted scales ofsalary for Elementary Teachers in excess of the provisionalminimum scale recommended by,the Burnham-Committee.     The repre-sentatives of both parties .0.1. that Committee agreed that it wasa minimum scale, and it would have been impossible to obtainits acceptance by sthe national Union of Teachers on any otherterms.     I do not think it is possible to treat the minimumscale recommended by the Burnham Gommittee as a maximum, and ifthe maximum was fixed somewhat&apos; that&apos;scale great pressurewould no doubt be exercised by,the.teachers on the Local Edu-cation Authorities to raise their salaries to the level of theState maximum, with the result that there would be no saving to
the Exchequer.      I have myself carefully considered thequestion whether, when the expenditure of a Local &quot;EducationAuthority on teachers in excess of that required by theBurnham Scale goes above a certain point, the burden shouldnot fall upon the ratepayers.     I have also been consideringwhether, as regards excess expenditure above a certain point,the principle of the sliding scale should not be introduced.At the present moment I do not think that the time is ripefor such action,     but if I have an opportunity I propose torefer to the matter, in terms of warning, in the Debate on theBoard&apos;s Estimates./.
