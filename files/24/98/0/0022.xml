REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE BILLMemorandum.Sub-section (4) of Section 5 of the Representationof the People Act, 1918, provides as follows:-&quot;(4) A male naval or military voter who has served, orhereafter serves in or in connection with the presentwar shall be entitled to toe registered as a par1lamentaryelector if that voter at the commencement of servicehad attained, or during service   attains, the age of 19years, and is otherwise qualifiedft.A naval or military voter is defined elsewhere in thesection as a person who is serving on full pay as a member ofany of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown, or whois abroad or afloat in connection with any war in which HisMajesty is engaged and is occupied In certain specified classesof service.There are many cases of men discharged from the Forceswho had reached 19 when serving in the war but are not yet 21years of age.    Doubts have been felt whether these men who hadacquired the right to be registered as electors at the age of19 when serving in the Forces can be registered before theage of 21 now that they are no longer serving in the Forces,Paragraph (a) of Clause 1   of the Bill removes the doubt bymaking it clear that a man who had acquired the right under thesubsection to be registered at the age of 19 retains the rightafter demobilisation although he may not yet be of full age.A further point arises in this connection.    Whileit is accepted that the Act intended to confer the privilegeof registration at the age of 19 upon men in the Forces whoreach that age during the tfar, there are two classes of menwhose service in the war will have terminated before theyreach that age, viz:-
(ij   those vrtiose service may have terminated (by reason/ of discharge or invaliding) before they reach 19:(ii). those in whoso case (although they, continue to serveIn the Forces; the War:itself may have terminated. before they reach 19,&apos; Men In class (i) are .clearly not entitled to beregistered until they are of fuZl age;   and.it is csoumedthat the Act did,-not contemplate that the men in class (ii)should be &apos; piaced - in any pos it ior* of gre ater advant age,   Thelanguage of the Act has however ^Iven rie$ to a doubt withregard to the men in class (ii.)) . and paragraph (b) ofClause 1 of the Bill has accordingly been inserted.to removethis doubt j which&apos; It is very desirable to clear up. in viewof the considerable number of boys.affected in the Navy and&quot;Array,J
