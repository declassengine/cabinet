/This Document is the Property of ^-^SU/14 f 11WPOSITION 0? ESTABLISHED DOCKYARD WORKMEN^ IN-RELATION TO STRIKES.JMAdmiralty herriorandu.ni for the Cabinet.&quot; V- -y &apos; workmenThe question whether Established Dockyard /Can bepermitted to join in strikes has been forced to notice inTp     connection with the recent strike of the Ironfounders.A number of Ironfounders employed in the Royal Dock-yards took part in this strike, acting under the Instruc-tions of executive officials of the Trade Union. Amongstthe number were two Established founders in PortsmouthDockyard.The Established founders In general, and a largeproportion of the Hired founders, did not obey the instruc-tions of the Trade Union.The men who did not obey the instructions hove beenexpelled   from the Trade Union, thereby suffering the lossof the Trade Union Superannuation Benefits to which theyhave been contributing during the period of theirmembership.The men at Portsmouth who have remained at work haveasked the Admiralty to put pressure on the Trade Union tosecure their re-admission.   They point out that If they areexpelled from their Union for rem: ining at work, and Iffurther the men who went on strike are&quot;permitted to returnto work in the Dockyard without loss of status or otherdisadvantage, loyalty to the Union will have p?id much betterthan loyalty to the State.Established workmen have an advantage over Hired work-men both in respect of the guaranteed permanency of theiremployment, and of the Superannuation Benefits at thetermination of their employment on account of age or infirm-ity or In case of abolition of employment.The establishment on the other hand carries with itcertain obligations on the part of the employee, which areexpressed in the application Form D.124; and which, readstrictly, are doubtless inconsistent with obedience to a callfrom his Trade Union to come out on strike (see copy of formattached).The   estab 11 sliment system has been supported on theground that it attaches to H*h. Service, by ties of self-interest and sentiment, a body of workmen In the differentclasses of occupations who could be relied upon in emergen-cies, and whose presence would always act as a steadyingInfluence.   This beneficial influence of the establishmenthas been held to be exercised not only directly &quot;in the caseof the Established hen themselves, but also by reason of thefact that the Hired Workmen of long service look forward tobeing eventually established in vacancies.     The system thustends, it has been urged, to facilitate the regular and order-ly management of the Dockyards and Admiralty IndustrialEstablishments, and to reduce the effectiveness of forcesthat would, otherwise take advantage of adventitious circum-stances to upset settled arrangements In the Interests ofparticular groups or classes of employees.Just/-
Just as the establishment is highly prized by theemployees in h.l. Dockyards, so is it frequently denouncedby Trade Union officials, who see in it a factor which im-I pairs their control over the workpeople. Notwithstanding&quot; this, it has been found possible hitherto to avoid forcingthe (from either side) to a definite issue/of the compatibilityquestion  of the establishment with Trade Unionism.   Now, however,the incident referred to, although, involving only twoEstablished workmen, brings up the issue in a concrete form.It would be possible to deal with the Immediatequestion by deciding that the two Established workmen whowent on strike should thereby he held to have forfeitedtheir establishment.This, however, would be tantamount to a challenge tothe Trade Unions.On the other hand, if the decision be that the absenceon strike should not be treated as a delinquency, a precedentwill be created tending to absolve Established workmen fromtheir allegiance to the Service, should this clash with theirallegiance to their Trade Societies on future occasions.No doubt the Establishment system would still operatej in many important ways, tending to the rendering of loyaland continued service by the employees individually.   Itwould still be quite legitimate and logical to mete outdisciplinary measures in case of any dereliction of dutyconnected with disputes not strictly of a constitutionalTrade Union        . character in the future.Notwithstanding the partial implication of theDockyards in the recent strike, the fact remains that aconsiderable proportion of the men and all but two of theEstablished men remained at work.   It is doubtful if such adegree of loyalty to employers was or would be experiencedin any other service.In the absence of the establishment the workmen wouldcome under the^pmplete control of the Trade Unions, and theDockyards woulcuin future be involved in national tradedisputes to a far greater extent than in the past.A third line of action would be to leave the conse-quences of the action of the Established men in going onstrike quite indeterminate; reserving it for the Treasuryto determine, on the men&apos;s eventual retirement, how theaction now in question shall be regarded in awarding theirpensions. There are obvious objections, however, to acourse which settles nothing for the present, and leavesopen a possibility of grievance in the future.It should be added thit there are indications that theTrade Union is disposed to arrange for the re-admission ofits Dockyard members who did not obey the call to come out onstrike. This may be partly with the expectation that theAdmiralty will thereby be induced to waive any penalties&apos;incurred by the employees who joined in the strike.Reviewing the whole of the circumstances and thepresent situation in the labour world, the Admiralty&apos;thinkthat the most expedient course would be to allow the twoEstablished workmen in question to retain their positions asEstablished men, but only on the understanding that the TradeUnion takes the action indicated in the preceding paragraph,and that this solution should, be reached by privatenegotiation if possible.(Intlld) Vv.H.L.12.2.20.
