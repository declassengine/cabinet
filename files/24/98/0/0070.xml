MEMORANDUM   3Y   SHIPPING   CONTROLLER.CONfiDENTlALexceeding 200,000 tons gross in each of the five years afterthe first two years must be made and notified to the GermanGovernment within three months of the coming Into force of theTreaty, i.e. before April 10th.On the assumption that in this way the Allies would obtainsomething material from Germany in reparation, the Controllersubmits to the Cabinet that the British Representative on theReparation Commission should be instructed to state that the  &apos;Bf^tish Government proposes to exercise her share of theserights, (which would probably amount to three-quarters of thewhole, i.e. 150,000 tons gross in each of these two years).If there were any prospect that Germany would be able tomeet her indebtedness for reparation by cash payments there- -might be something to be said for not exercising these rightsin view asf the possible opposition of shipbuilding interestsand labour in this country to what would be in effect placingorders in Germany.       As however Germany will presumably onlybe credited with the value of the ships so constructed and willnot be paid in cash, the Controller does not think that thepossibility of such opposition ought to influence the Government.Shipbuilding yards in this country are full up with orderswhich will last over the next two years, about a quarter of whichare for foreign aocount.If the Cabinet approve the principle submitted, theShipping Controller proposes that the vessels built on Britishaccount should consist of tankers, for which there is a verygreat demand at present, which is likely to continue for sometime to come.       Ke understands that British interests arethe Treaty comes Into force.The decision with regard tocontracting/
contracting in America for tankers to be built in theUnited States owing to the impossibility of obtainingearly delivery here.It should be borne In mind that, the decision inthis matter rests with the Reparation Commission and thatif Great Britain decides not to exercise her share of therights there is nothing&apos; to prevent Prance or Italy, or anyof the other Allies from talcing advantage themselves ofthe provision in the Treaty.The whole question of course depends upon whatGerjiiany is physically able to do, e,-g, in regard to theprovision of steel, etc., and this is being enquired into,but meantime the Controller thinks that the -ReparationCommission should be informed of the views of His&apos;&quot;Majesty1a&apos;Government. -      ,     r(SIGNISD) J.P.MACLAY.
