Military Secret. 1292 -^ o.r.....--------&quot;&quot;a/oK This Document is the- Property of^^QWrom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,^ilTAVu^W^ &quot; bth February 1920.(Received 13th.)1533.   5th February.   Malleson wires 31st January, repeating Teheran : &quot;Reports received from various agents on Northern Frontier of Khorassanpoint to continuous strengthening of Bolshevik troops on Frontier. Two hundredmore men with six guns have arrived at Kaakha. Between Bezmen and. GeokTope Bolsheviks are collecting supplies and munitions oi: war.&quot; 2.

Camels hitherto collected by Bolsheviks have been used for bringing in grainfrom outlying villages and gathering saxaul1 for railway. Many have been slaughteredfor meat.&quot;&quot; There have been several reports from Frontier during the last few dayspointing to Bolsheviks experiencing unexpected difficulties in their final advance onKrasnovodsk. Many wounded are coming back from front, and to-day^ telegramssay Bolsheviks have had severe reverse in neighbourhood of Jebel. This would meanthey had been driven back some 50 miles. Volunteers are said to have receivedconsiderable reinforcements. All. this news lacks confirmation, but it is significantthat Bolsheviks, who are quick to announce all success, particularly their dailyoperations reports, have been silent regarding Trans-Caspian Front several dayspast.&quot;1 Root of shrub used for fuel,
