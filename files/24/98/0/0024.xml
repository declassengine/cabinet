HTHIS DOCUMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ^STYIS GOVFMBIT) ..SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 624. CABINET,- - J THF GOvWMflNT 0.? IRELAND BILL., \....../ (i,and purcha.se Scheme.)Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for ireland.. 3?W THE CABINET:The reservation of land purchase in the Home Rule Billmay be regarded as tantamount to a pledge on the part of theImperial Government to complete land purchase.   The questionis so closely connected with the Home Rule problem that somelegislative measure for its solution, or at least a statementof the Government&apos;s policy with respect to land purchase, willnaturally be looked for as part of the Home^ Rule settlement,and the fact that the revenue of the new local Governments willbe materially affected by any land purchase scheme makes itnecessary that the scheme for completion which the Governmentmay ,have in view should be at least adumbrated in connectionwith the financial proposals of the Bill.The legislative provisions to give effect to any suchscheme would of necessity be so lengthy and complicated as tooverload the Home Rule Bill if included in it.   Further, thescheme would take a considerable time to work out, and itsbearing upon the financial provisions of the Home Rule Billj .would require very careful consideration.* presumably the Government land purchase scheme would be(\ based upon the scheme recommended by the Irish Convention.That scheme wa3 put forward on the unanimous report of a Sub-Committee consisting of:- Lord MacDonnell, Mr. Barrie, Mr.Clancy, Lord ^ranmore and Browne, the Bishop of Ross, andMr. Stewart, and seems to have fcund favour with all classesand parties in Ireland.   In order to carry out such a scheme
it would bo necessary:   in the first place, to provide for theissue of stock charged on the Consolidated Fund of the UnitedKingdom and hearing interest at such a rate that vendors couldfairly be required to accept it as it a nominal value in paymentof purchase money.   The amount of the stock to be issued willdepend upon the extent and character of the land still unsold.As regards tenanted land, the Sub-Committee estimated the priceas slightly over sixteen millions, but admitted that it mightbe considerably higher; whilst, as regards untenanted-land,they found it impossible to give any estimate at all.   The&quot;size of the problem&quot; is therefore a matter which will have tobe investigated at the outset..The scheme also involves (l) the payment of a bonus tovendors according to a scale varying from 0 to 18$ of thepurchase money in inverse ratio to the number of years&apos;purchase represented by the purchase money; (2) very con-si derable administrative expenditure; (3) the provision offurther money out of public funds to enable the Land Commissionand Congested Districts Board to carry out land re-settlement incongested areas, and (4) the speedy completion of all salesnow pending and the raising of money arid issue of stock for thepayment of purchase money (over twenty millions) and bonus onsuch sales.The Committee recommended that all this expenditure shouldbe treated a3 part of Ireland&apos;s contribution to Imperialcharges, but under the Home Rule Bill as it stands they willbe charges upon the revenues of the local Irish Governments.Seeing that the solvency of these Governments will dependupon the financial obligations to which they may be renderedliable by any scheme of the Imperial Government for the com-pletion of land purchase, it seems essential that stepsshould be taken as soon as possible to ascertain approximately
through the Treasury, the national Debt. Commissioners, andLand Commission what the extent of these obligations would be.It may be expected that the cost of completing land pur-chase will fall on Southern and Northern Ireland in propor -tion to their respective areas rather than their respectivepopulations or valuation, and therefore the receipt of pur-chase annuities will not operate as an adequate compensationto southern Ireland unless the purchase annuities are appor-tioned between the two parts of Ireland on the area basis..Before directing investigations to be made I ask fora ruling of the Cabinet on the following points1.   Is the completion of Land purchase*to be treatedas part of the settlement of the Home Rule, question?2.-   Is the recommendation of the Convention to be takena3 the basis of the Land purchase scheme?(Intd.)   I.M.Irish office, S.W&quot;,12th February, 1920.
