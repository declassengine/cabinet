on practically all the old routes.   General conditions madethis more possible as the repatriation of troops to Australia,New Zealand, the Cape, Gknada and the United States all helpedto enable many of the old services to be Immediately re-started.In the early days after the armistice the tonnage of whichthere was the greatest lack was the olass of steamers suitablefor carrying troops and passengers,   Many had been lost and alarge number used as merchant cruisers and for other war purposes,and it took much time to get many of those available reoonditionedand into service.Further, from the beginning of 1919 the country had to facea continued series of serious strikes referred to hereafter, whichdelayed by months the repatriation of troops and the re-organisationof trades.Arrangements  were early made with Liner Steamship Companiesto take over as far as possible oomplete responsibility for therunning of their fleets of steamers and thereby much of theenormous loss of time consequent on strikes and labour troubleshas fallen upon owners.During the period of the war. the Ministry was responsiblefor the distribution of practically all the tonnage of the worldwith the exception of that sailing under the United States andJapanese flags, and the rigidly curtailed amount which neutralsrequired for their own needs.Although greatly sided by the Priority Committee theresponsibility for co-ordinating the demands of the variousDepartments of the Government requiring shipping services -&quot;Admiralty, far Office, Food Ministry, Munitions etc. rested on theMinistry of Shipping and also those of Allies, Colonies andKeutral countries, end it was only by using the most drasticmeans that absolute requirements oould be fulfilled.   The demands
of every section were constantly under investigation and therewere few which did not require to be greatly reduced, so that thevital needs of the country might be satisfied and the country andour Allies kept going during the war.After&apos; the armistice there was good reason to anticipate thatthe pressure for tonnage would gradually decline but contrary toexpectation with the passing months now difficulties consequenton constant strikes and serious labour troubles in practicallyevery country, made it necessary to maintain a measure of control,notwithstanding the gradual restoration of tonnage from war.services and the&apos;output of merchant shipbuilding.The strikes end labour difficulties refei*red to absorbedwhat should have been available tonnage, and It is questionableif to-day the country is getting within 40 to 50 per cent ofefficienoy from her shipping.As a matter of faot there is considerably more effectivetonnage on the seas to-day than ever before, while trade isenormously reduced.   In our own country as compared with the pre-war position, Imports are estimated to be down from about 60million tons to about 40 millions, and the export of coal aloneabout 40 millions down.   This represents an enormous reductionin real tonnage requirements and what applies to our own countryapplies to practically all the large European countries.   Germanyhas practically no trade, French trade like our own will take a.long time to retrieve itself, Austria has few requirements, and.Russia is out of the field, etc.Shipping has also been harassed by food control whichis responsible for a considerable percentage of the delaysexperienced.   There is no reasonable doubt that control howevernecessary for the moment it may be, as exercised to-day, is -detriment to trade and the regaining of our commercial position.Government oontrol means the elimination of private enterpriseand competition, which are the life of trade.   It generally means-4- the/
the payment of much higher prices.-&apos; It means diversions fromregular trading channels.   It means enormous so called profiteer-ing, not of necessity willingly, hut forced by Governmentconditions.It is believed that irrespective of any little disturbancewhich may take place on removal of control, such removal withina very short time will bring prices to a reasonable level anda very considerable fall be the result.   Merchants would bewatching for all opportunities of business, competition wouldbe revived, and healthy commerce again restored.Another important factor is that the great reduction inexports has enhanced very considerably the cost of importingof food, etc. Before the war outward freights paid a largepercentage of steamers running costs but now the position ischanged, as a large proportion of shipping must go in ballastwithout outward cargoes, to foreign ports to bring home food,which in such cases must pay the who3.e cost*v -Freights as a matter of fact howevor, have reallycomparatively little effect on value of foodstuffs althoughthey do greatly affect the production of iron and steel.   Theestimated freight on the 41b loaf, which costs about l/3d. toproduce, is about.lid., on sugar less than id. per lb. and ontea lees than Id. per lb.The Shipping Controller had anticipated a great fall infreights ere now, and he can, see nothing but unremunerativebusiness for shipping in the early future, if anything approachingnormal trading conditions are restored,   Meantime, with portsblocked consequent on restriction of hours of labour, indifferenceof workers and great railway congestion the open freight marketis being maintained at high figures, while ships badly wanted arelying in port and seamen kept idle.During/
During the past year the position at ports has gone frombad to worse and the Shipping Controller would impress upon theCabinet the necessity of taking if possible more interest in thepresent labour and Railway congestion problems.In almost every port working hours have been greatlyrestrictedi thereby enormously affecting despatch.   Somethinglike one fourth of pre-war working hours have been taken oft&apos; Inmany ports, and further, during working hours less work is donethan before the war.   It should be possible in many cases toarrange extra shifts where men are available but this is objectedto by some Unions and so delays go on and increase.The greatly increased cost of bunker coals is one of theprincipal factors in keeping up freights.   The best class ofCardiff coal has risen in about six months from about 40/-to about 115/-.   This on a River Plate voyage (for instance) onia steamer of 8,000 tons represents an increased working cost ofabout  7*000 to which has also to be added increased wages, portcharges and labour, and last but not least, increased delays in port.Since the Armistice, Government cargo has been carried atwhat has been the equivalent of Blue Book rates and in some casesat considerably less, but it has recently been found necessary toincrease the rates to provide the equivalent in view of increasedcharges referred to and Increased value of shipping.,British freight rates since the war have been much lessthan those of France, Italy etc. which countrieo after the warseem to have put no restriction on their shipping.   Thosecountries have paid at least 50$ more than our countrytCoasting rates to United Kingdom ports with coals are allrestricted.   Even, however, with all the difficulties there arevery definite indications of markets breaking apeciallyfor foreignwork and this will be followed by Home Trades0a vessels/
VESSELS UNDER MINISTRY MANAGEMENTApart from ordinary British vessels under requisitionand vessels controlled by the Shipping Ministry there wereat the time of the Armistioe 264 vessels consisting mainly offoreign vessels requisitioned under the law of angary, forthe management of which the Ministry was directly responsible.The terms under which these vessels were taken threw upon theMinistry the liability for re-conditioning them before theycould be returned to their owners.   To a large extent thisliability was compounded by negotiation with the individualowners and the work of returning these vessels is now completeexcept in regard to Russian vessels with regard to whichspeoial conditions apply.Against this relief however must be set the work involvedin the management of the German steamers handed over under thearrangements negotiated in conneo-tim, wH&amp; the Armistice.   Underthese the Germans undertook to hand over the major portion oftheir mercantile marine to the Allies, and in return were allowedby the Allies to import certain quantities of foodstuffs.   TheGerman cargo vessels were used for the carriage of these suppliesto Germany until the end of the cereal year.   Since then theyare being used by the Allied Governments among whom they aredivided for management for their own needs.At the present time enemy tonnage is  ivided for managementamong the Allies as followsGt,Britain France Italy Belgium All Alliesffo.

TheAgreement between the Prime Minister and President Wilson madediversion of these ships should be according to the war lossesin merchant tonnage suffered by the Allies.   The adhesion ofItaly to this agreement ha&apos;s been obtained, but her specialinterest in Austrian tonnage has heen recognised by a promiseon the part of Great Britain to sell to her the Austriantonnage v/hich would otherwise have come to Great Britain.   Japanhas also accepted the agreement.It is hoped therefore that now that the Treaty is ratifiedand the Reparation Commission brought into being, it will bepossible to make rapid progress with the final, disposal of theseships.   A considerable amount of preliminary work has been done..As and when these ships are handed over to the British Governmentthe Controller proposes to sell them as he has sold the standardships.VESSELS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER,With the cessation of hostilities the Shipping Controllerwith the approval of the Government set to work to dispose of thevessels built under contract.Contracts for 2&apos;75 teasels of 1,777,000 deadweight tons weretaken over during construction either by the builders or byother British owners for completion to private account while365 vessels of about 2,260,000 deadweight tons have been sold.in May in Paris recognised the principle,that the ultimate
In spite of the fact that a large number of ships had beencontracted for at very high prices in Canada and Japan, thenet result of the disposal of these ships is to show asubstantial profit to the Government, without taking intoaccount the millions which have been made by their tradingbefore they were sold.In this connection it may be pointed out that whereasthe average compensation paid by the Ministry to shipownersfor their ships lost by War Risk worked out at  20 oerdeadweight ton (including a number of expensive passengervessels) it Is oostlng owners to-day to replace tramp shipsfrom  26 to  30 per ton for the larger vessels and muoh morefor vessels under say 5,000 tons.WORLD STEAM TONNAGE POSITIONThe following shows the world position at the outbreakof war and at the end of June 1919s-1914 1919Gross Tons Gross TonsBritish .....   20,523,706 18,208,000Foreign .....   24,880,171 29,689,00045,403,877 47,897,000The German tonnage handed over to British management underthe Armistice terms is included in the foreign tonnage.At the, end of December steam vessels to the amount ofpractically 2,985,000 gross tons were under construction inthe United Kingdom and over 4,666,000 gross tons underconstruction abroad.It is thus seen after making ample allowance for the .-exceptional amount of repair work necessitated after war conditiand depreciation in quality, the effective world tonnage to-dayis substantially in excess of the pre-war tonnage, and israpidly increasing.   That this has not yet been reflected in afall in the world freight market is mainly explained by thelabour troubles in this md other countries coupled with thecongestion/
congestion of the ports consequent on the defects in internaltransport, already referred to.It is estimated that when Britain receives her proportionof German ships, she will have as much tonnage under her flagas pre-war, while the amount of tonnage building is very greatand by the end of this year what was lost during the wholeperiod of the war in the way of ordinary increases, promisesto be fairly well restored, subject to reasonable work beingdone in the Yards during this year.THE NATIONAL MARITIME BOARD.The National Maritime Board has continued to fulfil itsimportant functions of adjusting differences between employersand employees in the Mercantile Marine and no material stoppageof sailings has occurred during the year.   It has also fixed rutesof pay for the Officers and Engineers of the vessels employedby many local authorities such as,The London County Council,Port of London Authority, and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.The difficult problem of the resettlement of Officers andMen demobilised from the Royal Naval Reserve and other AdmiraltyForces has been satisfactorily settled.   Much anxiety wasoccasioned by the prospective release of a very large numberof Officers who had to be re-absorbed in the vessels whichalready carried an adequate complement.   The advent of theGerman ships together with other arrangements made by theMinistry have enabled most of the Officers to be resettledand there are now a comparatively small number unemployed.Arrangements have been made for financial assistance tobe granted to those in actual distress.Demobilisation created a considerable degree of unemploymentamong British and Foreign ooloured seamen whose places were takenby white seamen.   Repatriation to their colony has been offeredto all of these men but this offer was accepted by a comparativelysmall proportion of them.The/
The Gravesend Sea School has continued to train youths forsea service and since the Armistice about 1,000 have completedtraining and accepted employment afloat.At the time of the Armistice1 the Shipowners andRepresentatives of Masters had not come to an agreement regardingtheir rates of pay and a revised scale applicable to vesselsbelonging to and managed on behalf of the Ministry has been laiddown.   These rates have also been adopted by practically all theShipping Companies of the country.At the request of all the parties to the Board, arrangementshave been made for the setting up of a new Maritime Board for theMercantile Marine and after negotiations spread over the greaterpart of 1919, the Constitution of the new Board was approvedby a meeting on the 19th December, 1919, and it came intobeing on, the 1st January, 1920,FINANCEThe work of the Finance Branch in the Ministry^consists of the following:-(1)   Financial work arising out of the operations of theAdmiralty Transport Department,   This oontinues on a muchlarger soale then the pre-war basis.   It cannot fall to avpre-war basis until the Army and the Fleet have been reducedto a pre-war footing and all abnormal movements of troops(including repatriation) have ceased.(2)   Financial work arising out of the other operations ofthe Ministry of Shipping.   This is mainly the settlement ofaccounts on the redelivery of British aid Neutral requisitionedand chartered ships, and the sale of Government owned ships.   Thecurrent work which is also considerable relates to the ex-enemyships which are managed by the Ministry and the provision oftonnage for the Food Ministry and Timber Supply.
(5)   Financial work arising out of the Department of theController General of Merchant Shipbuilding which was takenover at the time of the Armistice.   Here a great deal of workremains to be done but it is entirely of a liquidation character.In this connection the National Shipyards at Chepstow includinghousing accommodation have just been sold on terms which arequite as good as can be expected in view of the shortage oflabour and housing,   and the considerable expenditure whichpurchasers will have to incur in order to complete the Yards.The Yards at Beachley and Portbury on which very littlehas been spent since the Shipping Controller took them overand which a?e in a less advanced state, have not yet been sold.(SGD)     J.
