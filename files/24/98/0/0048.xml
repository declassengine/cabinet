(THIS DOCUMENT -IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHITIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVSRNMMT) .SSCR1T,   6)/j CABINET,CP. 648.^INTOXICATING LIQ.UOR REGULATION BILL..........(Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Education) .(Note.   The accompanying Bill wag referred to the HomeAffairs Committee in December last, and &quot;by them referred(H.A.C. Minutes 46) to a sub-committee consisting of thePresident of the Board of Education, the Home Secretary, andthe Attorney-General.   The Attorney-General has been unableto devote his time to the Bill, &quot;but the President of theBoard of Education and the Home Secretary have re-examinedit in the light of the discussion at the Home Affairs Com-mittee, and subsequent     suggestions by the prime Minister).1. Object of th^^Bill.The object of the Bill is to secure, in a form suitableto peace conditions, the principal measures by which duringthe war the adverse effects of drink on national welfare wererestrained, and a high     standard of sobriety reached.   TheGovernment pledged themselves to this principle at the generalelection, and both for this reason and to remove the anomalyof the prolongation under peace-conditions of a scheme ofcontrol devised for war-conditions and involving the continuedexistence of the Central Control Board, it is very desirablethat the Bill should be introduced and passed early in thesession.It does not purport to be necessarily a final settlement;on the other hand, it need not prejudice, financially orotherwise, future action upon other and more radical lines;and it contair ; in itself, if experience can be relied upon,the promise of real and lasting reform.
Central Authority (&quot;Licensing Commi 3 si on&quot; j . &apos;The war has proved the desirability of establishing aCentral Authority specially charged to watch the drink tradein the national interest; the Prime Minister&apos;c speech to adeputation from the Temperance Council of the Churches laidemphasis on this point.   The work of Licensing Justices,though of great value in itself, ha3 long stood in need ofco-ordination, and the absence of such co-ordination is asource of not ill-founded complaint by the trade.&apos;   It isimpossible to make statute-lav; sufficiently elastic to meetthe different and constantly changing conditions of differentdi strictause 1.The Central Authority will not represent sectionalinterests; it is to be a small body of trained people.   Itause 2.   will be assisted by Advisory Committees of a widely repres-entative-character, and it i3 to these Committees that theappointment of individuals identified with sectional interestswill be appropriate.The Central Authority will be responsible to Parliamentthrough the Home Secretary, and will exercise, besides thenew powers conferred by the &quot;Bill, the powers with regard tolicensing now exercised by him.   It will work largely byadministrative advice to.Licensing Justices.   This is a realpower for which the constitutional relations between theHome Secretary and the Justices afford a good foundation, andwhich the general tenor of the Bill will help to make effec-tive.   The Commission are also empowered to make regulationsauthorising the Licensing Justices to make provision withintheir area on points of local detail (Clause II).
The Bill applies to ingland and Wales, and adecision is wanted whether a separate corral. 3 si on for Walesis desirable.   The Bill as drawn provides (clause 2 (2)&apos;)for a separate advisory council for Wales (to advise onpolicy questions), but only one commission, operating overboth England and Wales,   on merits, this is right; it ismere economical,  since there ia not more work than onecommission can do: and it is better adapted to the respon-sibility of the Home Secretary under the Act, to whichparliament will attach the greatest importance.   A separateWelsh Commission could only be granted as an uneconomicalconcession to national sentiment.1,0cal^optionJf or jr ^uction of licences jr/i.th compensation.The Carlisle undertaking has shewn the value of a largescale reduction of redundant licences.   Clause 9 providesfor certain improvements of the present machinery forreducing licences over the country at large, under thepresent discretionary.powers of the Licensing Authoritiesand with limited funds;   Part- II of the Bill provides fora compulsory and much more rapid ana comprehensivereduction, where an area -votes for that course.The voting area is the earae as the. area for compensa-tion purposes under the Act of 1910 - ordinarily a countyor county borough.   This is. essential on financial grounds.power is taken to apply to all voters the absent voters&apos;provisions of the Representation of the People Act.
A reduction resolution requires the properAuthorities to reduce&apos; the number of on-licences by 25$.One further reduction resolution (after not lessthan three years) is allowed, which requires a furtherreduction of 2Z% of the licences left after the first,resolution - the total reduction being thus 43^ of /theoriginal number of licences.   This happens to be approxi-mately the percentage by which licences in the Carlislearea have been reduced: further reduction is probablyunnecessary,, and might strain the finance.Payment of compensation is to be by annual instal-ments, with interest, compensation levy being maintaineduntil all claims have been discharged,   The levy is tobe increased, if necessary, above the ordinary maximumso as to complete discharge within 10 years.     Thecommission are to make rules for payments on account totenants, and for settlement with them in priority to thepayment of capital instalments to major interests,A reduction resolution has the further effect ofprohibiting the Licensing Justices from incressing thenumber of licences so reduced by granting new licences,and secures that no new clubs shall bo registered with-out the consent of the Justices,A reduction resolution may be rescinded by anotherpoll after three years,   The effect, of a rescinding re-solution is to remove the restrictions on new licences and newc lub s.The scheme also includes a provision enabling anyparish, by a vote, to prevent any new licence beinggranted in the parish,   This is separate from the&apos;optionfor reduction
The Trade fear the principle of local option, andare likely to oppose this Part of the Bill at any ratewith all their power, even if it will not make themexert all their resources against the Bill as a whole.But it has the merit of affording some promise, at anyrate in county boroughs, of effecting, without expenseto the Exchequer, a much larger reduction of redundantlicences than has hitherto been possible except inCarlisle; and it should secure the warm support of thetemperance party for the - Bill.   It is moreover agenuine appeal and encouragement to local and oopularopinion to interest itself in the reform of its ownlicensing system.Treatment of Clubs,The Bill affirms the principle of uniform treatment,in the matter of restrictions, between clubs and publichouses.   The importance of this was proved during thowarj   to establish a careful and severe code of restric-tions for public-houses without applying them to clubsIs not only useless but dangerous.   Moreover the Tradewould with reason complain of preferential&apos; treatment forclubs.   The clubs impugn the principle of imposingrestrictions upon them, since their states is reallythat of a co-operative private household,   This pleaignores the reel facts, and they have been told that theprinciple of no restrictions on clubs is outside practicalpolitics.   They have not agreed to waive their claimfor absence of restrictions,, and they will oppose themeasure;   but they have suggested arrangements as tohours etc., in the event of their failing to securetheir principle; which would not be widely differentfrom the scheme of hours likely to be set up by the
Commission, and might afford a basis for compromise inpractice.Except under the local option provisions, the Billdoes not propose to set up a discretionary licensingsystem for clubs, as asked for both by the temperanceparty and the trade.     Such a proposal would be foughtdesperately by the clubs.Powers of Commission.8 (a)   Regulation of hours%   This is agreed to beessential, and there should not be great difficulty incarrying it.(&quot;b)   Regulation of price.   During the war the priceof intoxicants has been regulated by the Pood Controller,and a decision is wanted whether a similar power shouldbe vested in the Commission,    As against the Govern-ment&apos;s general policy of tte-control, the reason for con-tinuing the power is the prospect for some time to comeof a restricted market in beer and spirits, in whichartificial prices would be charged.   This would causeindustrial unrest, and might inflate, profits to an extentsufficient to increase the cost of State Purchase. More-byover it is onlyf/prudent control of price that theExchequer ean derive the full benefit of the posslbilitieof drink-taxation; -without such control, the trade willalways on any tax, add a more than equivalent sum tothe retail price, and saddle the Government with theodium.(c)     Gravity and strength.     The control ofgravity of Beer in now before the Cabinet, and a decisionis/
is requested whether power to control gravity shouldbe vested in the Commission.   It may be that theexisting orders as to gravity against which thetrade protest are&apos; not the best possible, and thattheir points could be met without surrendering thepower of control.     The present state of knowledgedoes not enable it to be decided whether power tocontrol gravity can be dispensed with without damageto the public interest; and it is right to put thecommission in the position of exploring the subject,and determining whether and in what way control shouldbe exercised.It is essential to give power to control thestrength of spirits.     Strong spirits have been provedinjurious, and to return from the present to the pre-war strength of spirits would be disastrous.General machinery forjreducing redundancy^Clause 9. effects improvements in the presentmachinery for reducing licences under the 1904 Act.The question is whether provision should be madefor extinguishing redundancy over the country atlarge on a more.comprehensive scale than can beachieved by-mere improvements of machinery.     LordD&apos;Abernon is of opinion that it is imperative to makesuch an attempt, and proposes that a proportionof the liquor revenue should be ear-marked as acentral fund,, to be administered by the Commission,
as a supplement to the existing compensation funds.     The ID 6central fund would be used in the most congested areas, wherethe existing financial provision is inadequate.     Theadvantages claimed are th-.it the suppression of redundancy isurgently necessary to social welfare, and that the resultingimprovement in the economic status of the trade would enable -it to bear fresh taxation, by which the State&apos;s expenditure &apos;could be eventually recouped^     The objections are thepresent financial stringency, and the point, which willcertainly be taken by the temperance party, that public fundsshould not be   nsed in a manner which would result in theenrichment of the Trade.   To my,mind the advantages decidedlyoutweigh the disadvantages.Improvement of licensed premises.Clause 10. The Bill empowers the Commission to grant acertificate to premises which have a record of good management,and provide facilities JEor food or recreation, instead ofmerely selling drink.   The advantages of the certificate are(l) relief from paying extra licence duty in respect of the&quot;improved&quot; part of the premises and (S) (clause 11 (l) (a) )power, subject to the discretion of the Licensing Justices,to provide informal music without a full public music anddancing licence.   The Bill further provides (clause 15) inconnection with the improvement of licensed premises, for anover-riding power to the Commission against refusal of LicensingJustices to consent to structural alterations, where suchrefusal impedes the application to particular premises ofgeneral principles of design and management laid down by theCommission.The Trade attach great importance to obtaining greater free-dom to improve licensed houses and will strongly oppose any Billfailing to make such provision.   The temperance party, on thewhole, are opposed to improvement of licensed premises-.The reasons for the above provisions are that a policy ofimprovement has been followed in the Carlisle area, where itsresults have told in favour of greatersobriety/
sebriety.    It is obviously dixficult for &apos;t^&amp;*at*/bo Tarfaae: AcTrade opportunities of pursuing a policy whiek the State itselfhas followed; it is true on the other hand that the managfemsnt fiffthe Trade is interested, whereas the management of tho State isdisinterested oState,  ManagementcThe Bill (elauses 25 &amp; 26) provides for the cafctinuanoe underthe Commission of tfoe existing State Management districts, and for thejtalcing over of new State JBafeJMSjgcaa^ by Provisional Order.There is- undoubtedly a strong feeling in favour of universalState Purohase,:iwith or without looal option for prohibition.   TheLabour Party have appointed a Committee to push this policy, andat present that Committee are moving for State Purchase without localoption.    There is no doubt something in tho view that if StatePurchase is to be carried out at all it should be oarried out now,and there is less chance of buying upon pre-war profits the longerit is postponed.    But it is assumed that the Government have deciAedagainst immediate purchase of the whole trade, and that t i large issueof Government guaranteed stock would be too great a strain uponGovernment credit at the moment.    On the othor hand, it is incen-oeivable tkat the Carlisle sohemo should be summarily abandoned, andthero would h^ a great outcry if no opportunity of extending itwere afforded.The method of extension proposed in the Bill is open to theobjection that it would be slow in operation, sinoe every provisionalorder would be opposed.    The alternative is to provide fer StatePurchase by local option&apos;.    This would involve scheduling tho terms ej)purchase to the Bill;   tile Sumner Committee terms might be made appliesable to any State Purchase resolution carried during say the next threeyears, though even that proposal would *)6 strongly opposed by theTrade.   The terms on subsequent resolutions would have to bo loft toa supplementary statute.    The principal objection,, however, toState Purchase by local option is that it would be impossible toguarantee that tho resulting area would bo administratively andfinancially a sound one to work,
The Bill pro Tides -f^r-^pre &amp;errtattonsjji favour of StatePurchase being made by local authorities or Licensing-Justices;&apos;and such a representation, -insofar as it would lend support toa provisional order, would seoure something of the mot&amp;wpowerof a scheme of purchase by local option.Welsh Sunday.Before the mr, public houses in Wales (exclusing Monmouth-shire) were closed throughout Sunday, while clubs were permittedto supply drink throughout- the day.     The Central Control Board&apos;sOrder relating to ^a las.-and Monmouthshire provided that clubs,as well as public houses, should supply no drink on Sunday,,   TheWelsh clubs now make strong representations as to the resent-ment occasioned by the prolongation of this provision in timeof peace, and find great difficulty in restraining their members.There are three possible courses (a) to provide thatpublic houses and clubs alike must supply no drink on Sundays *This would cause so much resentment in South Wales as to beunsafe,   (b) To provide that, either throughout Wales or in anypart, both public houses and clubs might supply drink onSunday during limited hours, on the understanding that the hourswere the same for both classes.   This, though right from thepoint of view of the interests of temperance, would offendpredominant Welsh sentiment to which the Sunday closing Act isvery precious.     (c) To refrain from interfering with theSunday closing of public houses, but to empower the Commission,notwithstanding the principle of uniformity as between clubsand public houses, to permit Welsh club3 to supply .drink onSundays during limited hours.    The Bill In its present form(Clause 34 (2)) provides for this third alternative.   Its dangeris that it appears to abandon the principle of uniformity, andthus paves the way for a demand from English clubs for longerhours both on Sundays and on weekdays.    The counter-argumentis that theconcession/
concession anises only out of the special circumstancesof 17ales on a particular day of the week,A decision has also to he taken whether, followingthe Licensing Bill of 1908 and the orders made durin g thowar, Monmouthshire is to be made part of the Wales forthe purposes of the Sunday closing provisions *Mi s o e 11 ane ous provis i ons,The Bill contains various minor provisions whichexperience has proved to be useful in promoting temper-ance.    These are probably non-contentlous*(Sd) .   H.A.L. FISHER*rFebruary 14th 1920,
