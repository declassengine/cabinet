This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.^-^^\  CONFIDENTIAL.       3 ^5 7col) THE CABINET.THE POSITION IN SOUTH-WEST RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a telegram received from Major-General Holman.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The Wak Office.February, 1920.0149/8996From Major-General Holman, Constantinople, to Secretary of State.(No. I. 1^20.) 16th February, 1920.Have seen Denikin. Rumour of proposals to enemy which I queried in myNo. D. 34, 25th January, has been now confirmed by Press, but has not been confirmedto me officially. It makes it impossible for Denikin or me to appreciate situation. Itmay be culminating blow of a whole series of measures taken at critical moments toDenikhVs disadvantage, either when he looked likely to win or when he was underdifficulties. Coincidences have been so remarkable that Russia attributes steps taken todeliberate desire either to weaken Russia or help Bolshevists. They have certainlvdestroyed faith which anti-Bolsheviks need if they are to continue to struggle successfully.Without faith in us, the only people who have helped them materially, they are likelyto be driven to despair.Nevertheless, Denikin and staunch elements are determined to fight on. Theyprefer to be driven into the sea or to be otherwise destroyed if the only alternative isto make terms with these murderers of their relatives, including women and littlechildren. They rightfully consider that there is no cowardice so great as to attempt toplacate such criminals. Unfortunately for the good name won by us in the war, theythink of trading with enemy at this moment in this light.Mackinder came here and assured Denikin that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldsupport him whole-heartedly on certain conditions, to which Denikin agreed, althoughthis involved abandonment by him of some cherished ideas. Mackinder returned toEngland to arrange, as Denikin thought, for the much-needed economic assistance.Nothing further was heard until Press announced that an economic mission wasproceeding, not to Denikin, but to Moscow, and this is done at a time when the agentsof the Soviet leaders, whom we are going to assist economically, are stirring up Afghans,,Indians, Chinese and others to murder our women and children in the East.If I and my officers are filled with amazement and burning indignation the feelings,of anti-Bolshevik Russia can be more easily imagined than defined. Denikin needs thefinal packet and thanks you most sincerely for your promise of completion of it. Healso expresses his deepest gratitude to you personally for the help you have given himand Russia, and wishes me to say it will never be forgotten. He is determined to fighton against the criminal tyranny of the Bolshevists and is astonished that Soviet leaders,should have been able to persuade people in Europe that they differ in any way fromtheir real characteristics.He also considers and I agree that the mass of Russian people are anti-Bolshevistsand that any support of the leaders will be deeply resented by them in the future.British people will have to pay heavily in blood and treasure if the Bolshevists areallowed to win. Bolshevists continuing their murders, burnt wounded in Rostov, andaccording to information by our Russian authorities have brutally tortured andmurdered two British officers who fell into their hands near Rostov early last month.General Denikin. is putting up game fighting against heavy odds, is doing well andshould be given fair chance to win.(1320/116)   100  2/20  H&amp;S   7982wo
