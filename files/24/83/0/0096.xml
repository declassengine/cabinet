0 P. I N ION.(1).   %ere, in the opinion of the Secretary of State an emergency has arisen -in *faich it is expedient for the public service that the Government should have control over the transmission of messages by -the&apos;Company&apos;s telegraphs., he may, under section 52 of the Telegraph Act, 1863,  (26 &amp;27, Vic.4-a. 1.12) by warrant (inter alia.) direct and authorise such persons as he thinks fit to assume the. control of. the transmission of messages.by any oable company&apos;s telegraphs-,  either wholly or partly, and in. such manner as he directs;,   re&apos;-think that this $revision empowers him to assume con-trol by requiring the Company to submit to a person or persons authorised,  oopies of all messages received from abroad or des-patoned abroad by the company either before or after transmission. So such warrant has effect for a longer time than one ^&quot;eek from the issuing thereof, but successive warrants may be issued from week to week as long as, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the emergency continues.   The Company is entitled to oom*-pensation for any loss of profit sustained by reason of the exercise by the Secretary of state sf any of his powers under the section, the amount, in default of agreement between the Secretary of state and the Company, to be settled by arbitration.(2).
