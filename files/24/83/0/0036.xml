This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.187WAR CABINET.CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LORD SALISBURY AND MR. CHURCHILL REGARDING LORD FRENCH&apos;S ANIMADVERSIONS ON LORD KITCHENER.I.-DRAFT OF A PROPOSED STATEMENT BY LORD SALISBURY.Some misconception has arisen from the statements recently published by Lord 121French as to the relations between Lord Kitchener and himself at the end of August IJ(556 and beginning of September, 1914.   It seems right, therefore, with the permission of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the following facts should be placed upon record : As we all remember, notwithstanding the spendid gallantry of the Allies, their armies were forced back from Mons to. the neighbourhood of Paris in the course of the first month of the war. During the retreat the British Army suffered very heavily. On the 31st August when it reached a position some 50 milos tu une north-east of Paris it was forming a section of the Al &apos; J3 line with the French Army on either side of it. The French Commander-L ...^x determined to continue the retreat and on the 31st August Sir John French telegraphed to Lord Kitchener as follows : &quot; This morning I received an official communication that General Joffre has made a change in his plan of operations and now intends to take up a more backward position .... General Joffre appears to me to be anxious that I should keep the position which I am now occupying north of the line Compiegne Soissons. I have let him know plainly that in the present condition of my troops I shall be absolutely unable to remain in the front line, as he has now begun his retirement. I have decided to begin my retirement to-morrow in the morning behind the Seine, in a south-westerly direction west of Paris. This means marching for some eight days without fatiguing the troops at a considerable distance from the enemy.&quot;To this Lord Kitchener replied immediately : &quot; I am surprised at your decision to retire behind the Seine. Please let me know, if you can, all your reasons for this move. What will be the effect of this course upon your relations with the French Army and on the general military situation ? Will your retirement leave a gap in the French line or cause them discouragement, of which the Germans might take advantage to carry out their first programme of first crushing the French and then being free to attack Russia ?&quot;On the same date, after the Cabinet had been informed, Lord Kitchener sent a further telegram to Sir John French &quot; Your telegram submitted to the Cabinet. The Government are exceedingly anxious lest your forces, at this stage of the campaign in particular, should, owing to your proposed retirement so far from the line, not be able to co-operate closely with our Allies and render them continuous support. They expect that you will, as far as possible, conform to the plans of General Joffre for the conduct of the campaign.&quot;In the meantime Sir John French was replying to Lord Kitchener&apos;s first telegram as follows : &quot; If the French go on with their present tactics, which are practically to fall back right and left of me, usually without notice, and to abandon all idea of offensive operations, of course, then the gap in the French line will remain and the consequences must be borne by them. I can only state that it would be difficult for the force under my command to withstand successfully in its present condition(B10/30-A)   70  7/19   H&amp;s  7278-two*
a strong attack from even one German Army Corps, and in the event of a pause in my retirement I must expect two Army Corps at least if not three. If owing to Russian pressure the withdrawals of the Germans turn out to be true it will be easy for me to arrest my retirement and to refit north of Paris, but this I cannot do while my rearguard is still engaged as it was up to last night.&quot;&quot; An effective movement now appears to be open to the French, which would probably close the gap by uniting their inward flanks. But as they will not take such an opportunity I do not see why I should be called upon again to run the risk of absolute disaster in order a second time to save them. I do not think that you understand the shattered condition of the second Army Corps, and how it paralyzes my power of offence.&apos;&apos;The next day Sir John French telegraphed : &quot; I hope that you understand quite clearly that in its present condition the force under my command is unable to support our Allies effectively, whatever their . position may be. It does not seem to be quite realized how shattered two Divisions of my small force are, and how necessary it is even for the remainder to rest and refit&apos;. As long as we are in close contact with the enemy it is impossible to make things right.&quot;Meanwhile [it is clear that] pressure was being brought to bear by the French authorities, and before the last telegram was received, indeed at one a.m. on.the 1st September, Lord Kitchener telegraphed to Sir John French : &quot; Has a message from the French Republic about your leaving the French line reached you yet ? The result of this may be serious to the French arms, and we feel that you should call on your troops for an effort. I am coming to see you this morning to talk over the situation, as I find it very difficult to judge. Please send tt telegram to the Embassy at Paris immediately stating where we can most conveniently meet.&quot; .Lord Kitchener went to Paris and conferred with him. After they had parted the following communication from Lord Kitchener recorded the result of the interview : &quot; 1st September, 7.30 p.m.&quot; After thinking over our conversation to-day I think I am giving the sense of it in the following telegram I have just sent to Government : &quot; &apos; Frenclfs troops are now engaged in the fighting line, where he will remain conforming to the movements of the French Army, though at the same time acting with caution to avoid being in any way unsupported on his flanks.&apos;&quot;I feel sure you will agree that the above represents the conclusions we came to; but, in any case, until I can communicate with you further in answer to anything you may wish to tell me, please consider it as an instruction.&quot; By being in the fighting line you will of course understand 1 mean disposi-tions of your troops in contact with, though possibly behind, the French as they were to day ; of course you will judge as regards your position in this respect.&quot; I was very.glad to meet you to-day, and hope all will go well and that Joffre and you will make the best plan possible for the future, which you will I hope communicate to me.&quot;And on 3rd September Sir John French replied : &quot; I fully understand your instructions ... I am in full accord with Joffre and the French.&quot;From this series of communications it will be apparent that Sir John French took so grave a view of the situation of the British Army that he had resolved to retire temporarily from the front line to a position behind the Seine, which was eight marches distant. This decision whether it were right or wrong evidently involved consequences! of such vital importance that both Lord Kitchener and the British Government as a whole were deeply concerned and the French authorities lodged an urgent protest. It cannot be thought surprising in such circumstances that it was decided that the Secretary of State himself should go to Paris to confer personally with the Commander-in-Chief.
No other course was open to the Government and to Lord Kitchener, and in fact he started in the middle of the night. It also appears that Lord Kitchener left the place of meeting to be decided by Sir John French. This last is a detail of relatively small importance, but it,is right to note it because writing some 4 years afterwards Lord French makes it a matter of complaint that he was compelled to leave his headquarters.It is almost unnecessary to say that the instructions which were given to Sir John French as the result of Lord Kitcheners visit led to no ill-consequence. On the contrary, the accord which was established between them,&apos; and which was recorded in the instructions mentioned in the last two telegrams, was the prelude to the victorious offensive which has reflected such imperishable lustre upon Lord French i in self and the army which he commanded.I have no desire to dwell upon the impression which seems to have been left upon Lord French&apos;s mind of his relations with Lord Kitchener during these strenuous days, hut at the time only about a fortnight after the period to which these telegrams refer  he wrote to Lord Kitchener upon the occasion of a debate in the House of Lords a letter, of which the following is a passage : -&quot;Among my most treasured possessions at home is an old letter I have from you written hurriedly on a telegram form telling me what you thought of our Kimberley and Pardeburg work. It reached me when we were fighting. I think I have told you about this before. As a soldier lvalue your opinion and good word before anything. You can then well understand what 1 feel about your generous words in the House of Lords. I thank you with all my heart. You have given me incalculable encouragement and help.&quot;II. DRAFT OF MR. CHTJRCHILL&apos;S REPLY TO LORD SALISBURY.You have represented to me by letter and in conversation that certain official telegrams bearing upon the circumstances in which Lord Kitchener was sent in August, 1914, to Paris should be published, and you have pointed out that, the references by Lord French and subsequently by Mr. Asquith- to what took place at that juncture, by no means afford a comprehensive or complete basis on which the judgment of the public can rest itself.It appears, however, very inadvisable to continue the practice of partial publication of documents of a public character in regard to particular episodes of the war. Even the fullest possible publication of all the documents connected with a particular espisode would not be satisfactory, because the war was not proceeding by a series of separate episodes. It was flowing out in an unbroken stream of events from day to day and no definite judgement can be formed of any particular events except in relation to what had gone before them. Further, it is not easy to judge the actions of individuals or of Governments in these circumstances except in relation to the circumstances existing at the time and to the knowledge of the situation which they then had in their possession or which it was possible for them to have acquired. To say this is not to deny the advantages of historical examination and criticism. My object is very strongly to deprecate the formation of harsh, partial and sensational views in regard to matters of the utmost doubt and complexity. Such a process would be aggravated and not diminished by a partial publication of documents.[If there is to be such publication, it should clearly be general in its character. A series of authentic documents dealing with the history of the war as a whole should be carefully collated and published by the War Office, the Admiralty and the Committee of Imperial Defence, from which the War Cabinet system was afterwards developed. These documents should endeavour to provide the public with the fullest measure of authentic data, without revealing State secrets which have a current importance or affronting allied countries, to enable an historical opinion to be formed.These are early days for such a publication. We are so near the events and peace has not yet even been signed, but I am of opinion that the compilation of the documents should certainly be undertaken so that they can be made public in a series of Parliamentary Papers as soon as the proper opportunity occurs.]In the meantime I am afraid I cannot agree, on behalf of. the War Office, to the publication of the various telegrams which passed between Lord French and Lord Kitchener during the retreat from Mons as an isolated and exceptional disclosure. All the same, I have no hesitation in saying that when all these telegrams are published,
III. LETTER FROM MR. LONG TO MR. CHURCHILL.My dear Churchill, 19th June, 1919.I am very much obliged to you for sending me Salisbury&apos;s letter and the draft of your reply.I concur, in the main, in what you say; but I am afraid the two paragraphs on page 3 of your letter marked in brackets, appear to me to pre-judge the question in reference to the history of the war and I could not consent at this stage to be committed to so definite an undertaking on behalf of the Admiralty.I venture to suggest that your letter would be complete if the two paragraphs to which I ,refer, were to be omitted, and the next paragraph amended so as to read: &quot; I am afraid therefore that I cannot agree on behalf of the War Office, &amp;c.&quot; The whole question is very difficult; and I am confident that it is of vital importance that for the present we should keep our hands as free as we can.Ever yours sincerely,WALTER H. LONG.IV. LETTER FROM MR. CHURCHILL TO LORD SALISBURY.My dear Salisbury, 27th June, 1919.The delay in sending you a letter is due to no neglect on my part, for I set about the task the same day thai: I saw you. Unfortunately the line I had proposed to take does not command entire agreement among my colleagues, and it will be necessary for me to take the opinion of the Cabinet on the particular question raised by your letter.I regret very much that you should have been kept waiting, and I will do my best to accelerate the matter.Yours very sincerely,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.as some day they must be, and when all the circumstances of the time have been fully marshalled and exposed, the result will not ba found unsatisfactory from a British point of view. The action of the Cabinet in sending Lord Kitchener to Paris to make sure that there was no breakdown in the relations between the Chiefs of the British and French armies will be fully vindicated. The action of Lord French in husbanding the strength of his small army after the tremendous injuries it had received, and in gathering it together for a new spring, will be found to be harmoniously related to the true and main course of military policy and in proper proportion to all the events which were taking place simultaneously at that time. The exertions of our French Allies, who at this time had to bear practically single-handed along their whole immense front the entire weight and burden of the long prepared German onslaught, will always command the admiration and gratitude of Britain ; and not least in this tale, the superb achievements of our own small army, not only in the first shock and during the retreat but in the turn at- the Marne and the Aisne, and subsequently in the equally decisive battle at Ypres, will take their immortal place in our military history.In all this when the facts become known will be found no ground for reproaches or counter-reproaches ; no question of &quot; indelible disgraces &quot; or &quot; irregular, interferences &quot; but only a record which posterhVy will regard with an increasing sense of thankfulness and pride. The more the kind of problems which His Majesty&apos;s Government, Lord Kitchener and Lord French were facing in their respective spheres, and the more the ,spirit of disinterested comradeship with which they met them, come to be understood, the greater will be the regard which their countrymen will bestow upon them and upon their memory.
