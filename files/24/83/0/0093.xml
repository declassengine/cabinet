From Viceroy, Foreign Department, \OtkJiily .19.19. (Received 12th, 10.45 a.m.) . ;1014 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Your telegram of 7th July. With all deference, we shall prefer our plan of a treaty in two chapters-first peace, then, friendship; for the reasons (1) this appears only course likely to secure immediate peace without, protracted negotiations, us we should propose to give Amir a definite time limit for acceptance or rejection ; (i:) force of circumstances, commercial, geographical,&apos; and political, including our power to close passes to Afghan nomads and traders, can hardly fail to force Amir to seek JViendJy relations with us sooner or later if left to himself. He will soon find that for his purpose,&apos;Bolsheviks are a broken reed, and will return to us ; (3) our draft treaty is not merely penal but holds our definite offer of friendship on old lines if Amir will only play the game. We could easily modify wording&apos;; (4) Amir&apos;s inducements to sign are to avoid our advancing on Kabul, to get us to withdraw our troops from Spin(cha) Baldak, and later from Dakka, and to conclude peace without humiliating conditions such as would be inevitable if&quot; war continued ; (5) we realise that Amir probably would not-carry out stipulations fully, but we should be able to judge from his conduct how far and on what terms it would be possible to conclude a treaty with him eventually. His failure to carry out stipulations would be less offensive than his failure to cany out terms of an actually concluded treaty.At the same time, we appreciate arguments put forward and are quite prepared to accept a treaty on lines proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government; as maximum at which our delegates should aim. But wc fear there is little or no prospect of &quot;Amir accepting your treaty as it stands.Crux of problem is Article (1), the control of his foreign relations. During the past year there has been a profound change in political outlook in middle East, including Afghanistan. General unrest awakened Nationalist aspirations, President Wilson&apos;s pronouncement, Bolshevik catchwords and other intluences have been at work. This change of outlook is evidenced in AmauulhVs first utterance as Amir, basis of which was the sovereign independence of Afghanistan, and the complete freedom of his external relations, if we press the matter we shall be met either with a flat refusal or with counter demand which we cannot brush, aside, and if in the end, we manage, by threats of renewal of hostilities, to-force on-Amir inclusion of your Article (1) in a treaty, wc should find that the provision would be broken, as it has been in part by his predecessors. For instance, Amir could not in the face of his people, refuse correspondence with Turkey, or even the admission of a Turkish mission. Thus Article urged would remain a dead letter, and we should be faced with necessity of winking at its breach or sending a force to Kabul to enforce compliance. Why you will ask did we include it in matters in which Amir is expected to show contrition and a desire for friendship (corrupt group) because although wo did not contemplate the provision again appearing openly in a formal treaty, believing that this would make AmanulhVs position impossible with his people, we thought that our delegates might be able to impress on Amir impossibility of his running alone, and that- period of 6 months&apos; probation would have convinced him of it. If we regain confidence of Afghanistan and get them to turn to us voluntarily in their difficulties-, we shall have secured more than we can do by any &quot; scrap of paper.&quot;, &apos;* :Your Article (2) harks back to a time of 40 years ago when Afghanistan was seriously afraid of Russian invasion. But though glad as Afghanistan then was to accept our promise of support, the very guarded and qualified terms in which that support was offered and in which it is proposed now to offer it, has been the cause of infinite mistrust in Afghanistan. Indeed, Amir Habibulla Khan made this only too plain to Bane mission. Amanulla, who thinks Afghanistan has now nothing to fear from Russia, would probably not thank us for this offer and would certainly not regard it as a quid pro quo for control of his foreign relations.Your Article (3). We agree, but we note that you (corrupt group ? do not) include (corrupt group) re-affirmation of DurancVs line by new Amir. It must be remembered until we can control our own tribes and prevent their depredations into Afghan territory, it is rather hard to expect Amir to abstain from giving them blackmail, as we do.Your Article (4). We agree, but it will probably be inconvenient at present to demarcate portion in the Mohmand country from Nawa Sar to the Kabul river, but
there is perhaps no need to exclude this portion for this reason. In oui^Qpiriion,;itr-is hopeless to secure Dakka or Kam Dakka under cover of demarcation--/without--appearance of annexation.Your Article (5).   Wo agree. *Wo would deprecate inclusion of our stipulation (1) in the Treaty, though we should informally make it clear to Amir that we should regard continuation of hostile foreigners of . Bolshevik missions,. &amp;c, in; Afghan limits as an unfriendly act.. Similarly, we would deprecate inclusion-of our stipulation (5), and should deal with it informally hy negotiation (corrupt group) our stipulations (3) and (G). We also recommend exclusion from Treaty of Afghan Post Office at Peshawar, and should (corrupt&apos;group ? secretly) announce to delegates that we would no longer allow this.We would suggest following addition after the &quot;importation of arms&quot; at tho end of Article: &quot; Subject to such restrictions as may appear necessary.&quot;.  We cannot, contemplate again allowing Amir absolutely unrestricted import of arms through India, and should ask in return an undertaking that he would not import arms from elsewhere.Fur.the rest we agree, but would add: (1) It must be remembered Amir&apos;s delegates will not come in as delegates of a beaten foe, and there are signs that Amir is not (corrupt groups) in want of a subsidy, regarding it as incompatible with independence ; (2) we strongly deprecate tying our delegates&apos; hands by. an reconcerted draft treaty. Their instructions should be elastic and not rigid, subject, of course, to their referring for orders before committing Government. Failure of Dane mission in 1905 is an excellent instance of attempting to negotiate with Afghans on rigid lines, unless of course, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared that,our delegates should hand a treaty to Afghans for acceptance or rejection by a given date on pain of immediate resumption of hostilities: This was the idea we had in mind in the draft treaty we proposed in our telegram 1)54 S., dated 29th June, but such a procedure would hardly be possible in a treaty on lines uow proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
