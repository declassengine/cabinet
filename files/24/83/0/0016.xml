H 7SUMMARYThe events of the week - the Southport Conference and the Signature of Peaoe - have occupied the public mind to the exclusion of the usual sutojeots of discontent.Though, under the oard vote system a resolution passed toy a Conference such as that at Southport is not to be token as entailing immediate oonaequcnoes, enlightenment on the issues involved by taking direct aotion in support of politioal views is very muoh needed.   A serious factor is the large number of extremists who have been elected to the new Labour Party Executive.There is no abatement in the agitation regarding Intervention in Russia, Income Tax  and ConBoription.   To these will shortly be added the Nationalisation of the Coal mines.   The consumer does not appear yet to be aware how muoh his own interesto are involved.-Signs are not wanting that a proposal to withdraw the War Bonus will be followed by great industrial unrest:   the workers argue that as the cost of living has not decreased, the War Bonus must be maintained.Definite/
r IDefinite evidence nan been received that the leaders in the Bolshevik movement in England, France andv&amp;america ore in touoh with one another ;.\nd with Moscow, wad that the Bolshevik movement is an international conspiracy of Jews. The identity of the secret Bolebevik Agent in Ulnglanqi is ^ known, as well as the reassuring faot that he has^reoeivety no communication from Russia for four months, owing to the difficulty of transmission.Reports have beer, received that the Germans in Buenos Aires are instructing: their agents to make attempts on the lives of leading Statesmen abroad.   Preventive measures have been taken, and the whol8 case is being oarefully investigated.
THifl POLICE?.Too much importance should not be attaohed to the resolution promising support to the Folloe, which was oarried by the Southport Conference.    In spite of the publio utterances of Polioe Union offioials, the membership of the Union is undoubtedly deolining, and will deoline further as soon as the announcement of additional pay is made publio.Liverpool is now the oentre of Polioe Union activity, Polioe Constable Smithwiok, addressing a meeting of about .2,000 people in the Liverpool Stadium on June 22nd, said that... the publio had him and other Union officials to thank for the faot that the. Polioe would not shoot down the workers....   He also said that spies in the Trade Union : movement were reporting to &quot;M.5.1. Department&quot;, London. Another Polioe Constable, named Halliday, said that one-third of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the whole of the Dublin Metropolitan Police had now joined the Union.Hayes, the.rieoretary, stated at Liverpool that the Chairman, and officials of the.Union had been promised a large sum of Government money if they would.cut themselves off from Labour,While the Police realise that they have done themselves no good with the publio during the recent agitation, it is reported that various Trades Unions have approached the Police Union with an offer of affiliation, and that the general motive is to make it impossible for the polioe to be used as strike breakers.COMMmqC.-iT.ION.....WITH FOPillflff BQIffiLigVIKS..During the pair-v week documentary evidence has been received that the leading Bolsheviks &quot;in&quot;England, France, and&quot; Amerioa are &quot;in touch with one another and receive directions fro.u Moscow.    The principal Bolshevik agent inthis/
(Knglish)this country, however, oonfeases that he has had no communication with Hosoow for four months.    This is a tribute to the effectiveness of the control at the ports. It has been thought better not to interfere with the Bolshevik agent in London for the moment,    He is not aware that his identity is known, and it is desirable to obtain evidenoe against other persons before any aotion is taken,-XNTI-IHTxiiHViiiNTIQN IN RUSSIA.The one day * s strike which had been fixed for June 23rd  id not take plaoe, though 10,000 miners in the Doncaster distriot were called out by     Watkins, an advanoed socialist who was present at the Kings Weigh House Conference on June 14th.    Miss Sylvia Pankhurst stated publicly on June 27th that the strike had failed through . . &quot;laok of unanimity among Labour&quot;, but that it would take place on July 21st.There was a Communist Party Meeting in :Trafal^r Square on June 29th, attended by some 2,000 people.    There were the usual violent speeoheB against Intervention in Russia.THE MOVEMENT FOR DIRSCT ACTION.Wy Liverpool correspondent thinks that the principle of direct aotion for political motives is gaining ground, and that the Independent Labour Party is taking full advantage of it.    On the other hand, there is much satisfaction with the Government aotion on the housing question.wjsst aiDiHa op Yorkshires.Revolutionary feeling is reported to be increasing in the West aiding, and agitators are active.A/i
(English) - 3 -A new Labour College is to be established at Bradford. It will be remembered that the Central Labour College in London is owned jointly by the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation , but other organisations may send Btudents on an inclusive fee for tuition, board, and residence, of  100 a year,WOOLWICH.Of the three present storm oentres , Sheffield, Coventry, and Woolv/ioh, the last named seems to be the most disturbed. Discharged service men in that distriot are very discontented, and are oompletining that the Government is using unemployment to foroe them back into the Army.    Agitators from all the moribund institutions appear to swarm to these oentres like flies to carrion.    i3ven speakers for the National Counoil of Civil Liberties, have been at Woolwich trying to persuade Branches of the aaalgamated Society of Engineers to affiliate with them.WhLammw op societies.The tendenoy towards amalgamation is running rather strongly.    Five more are now in contemplation.The suggested federation of some 860,000 unskilled workers under the leadership of idr.;Clynes, M.P., and Mr. W, Thome, m.f., with funds totalling over  1,000,000 may have a steadying effect on labour, sinoe the voting strength in a conference ballot would exceed that of the isiners1 Federation.national federation of discharged and demobilised3&amp;ILQR3 AND SOLD.Iti!.RS.A meeting of the Smethwick, Birmingham, West Bromwich and&quot;Oldbury branches, held at Birmingham on June 29th, cailed upon the Trace Union movement and particularly theTriple/
(iUngliah) - 4 - ITriple Alliance to tcke industrial aotion upon the reduction of the unemployment donation.The Nottingham branch, which numbers about 7,000, is aotive and a majority.of the members is reported to oppose ^ affiliation with politio&amp;l parties.      In spite of a general feeling of loyalty, a meeting of about 1,000 on June 23rd expressed strong disapproval of the rates of unemployment pay, the treatment of consumptive men and the employment of women as tram oonduotors and Post Office olerks.    One speaker stated that unless the men&apos;s grievances were redressed within six weeks a monster demonstration will be held in London.The Minister of Labour met representatives of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and of the Comrades of the Great War on June 25th and promised to consider the means by which they could be brought into direot touch with representatives of some trades organizations.According to the &quot;Scotsman&quot; of 25th June, the Irish National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Soldiers is causing considerable uneasiness in South Ireland;   a large body of the  Federation reoently attaoked the offices of the Southern Irish Division of the Comrades of the Great War, assaulting two wounded soldiers and doing considerable damage.    The Federation is said to possess large sums of money and Sinn Feiners boast that its members will form the front line of their next movement.At Long Eaton on the 21st June ex-service men took exception to disparaging remarks on the Royal Family made by James Stewart, editor of the &quot;Young Rebel&quot;.    It iB reported that only the presenoe of the polioe prevented trouble.

Halls, who is said to be insane, is doing a great deal of open air propaganda for the union.The North London Branch of the League, which is abnormally aotive and boasts a membership of 500, Is encountering opposition.    Meetings of 500 and 200 people at Finebury Park on June 29th Were much interrupted by ex-Servioe men * one of whom took the platform and obtained the support of a majority.On June 22nd the Indian, Abbusi, addressed an audienoe of some 300 under the auspices of the League 5 at another meeting on the same day, Guy Aldred adyooated immediate revolution.The organ of the North London Branoh, &quot;The its be 1&quot;, is now being printed.&apos; A branch of the League is to be formed at Hull.INDUSTRIAL WOl^SRS OF THfl WORLD.There has been a good de;.l of brawling at -the Industrial Workers of the World Club,    The organisation, .   whioh is making little headway, held a meeting on June 20th at whioh resolutions were passed demanding the, overthrow of the Government^ protesting against the peaoe terms^and urging British Socialists to join the Third Moeoow Internationale.&apos;:.

The inaugural meeting at Liverpool on June 25th attracted I only 60 people and it is unlikely that the league will beo Important.MISS SYLVIA PAMHGBST.Miss Sylvia Pahkhurst, who regards herself as the only real representative of the Bolsheviks in England , appears tt be in desperate str&amp;lts for money.   She is pressing Martens, the German leader of the New York Bolsheviks, to send her funds.    It appears that she is not trusted by the genuine Bolsheviks,In a letter to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; of 23rd June, Professor Lees-Smith stated that he has joined the Independent Labour Party because he considers that &quot;the only hope of saving civilization now rests in the establishment throughout Europe of Labour and Socialist Governments whioh will insist upon the revision of this mookery of a peaoe&quot;.*After refusing to pay a fine, Miss 0&apos;Neill, the Sinn Fein intimate of Sylvia Pankhurst, was sentenced to 11 days1, imprisonment in the 2nd division at Marlborougi Street, on 30th June, for insulting behaviour in Hyde Park cn the   ,previous!/

Details of the numerical strength of the Citizen Army in the West of Sootland were given - the total within a radius of 20 miles of Glasgow being 8175.

He has received - information that a Dominion Home Rule Bill giving a full measure of independence, but without the right to establish, an Irish tfavy or Militia&apos;; would be introduced by ir, Lloyd George ,; but this- would not prevent him froi continuing to agitate for a Republic,   He is being received in America as &quot;The  resident of the Irish Republic.&quot;A reliable informant reports that Sinn Peiners are very active in trying to purchase rifles and&apos; ammujttion from soldiers - even going to the extent of borrowing uniforms in order to enter barracks to obtain arms..

For this purpose small coasting craft known as pig- boats are said to be used. Certain measures were taken whioh had the effeot of alarming Tanner, and the transaction is likely to come to nothing.I    I: i
