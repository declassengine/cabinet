Part V: Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work  (b) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Part I.-Direct Action and the Labour Party Conference.The vital question which arose at the recent Conference of the Labour Party was undoubtedly that of &quot; direct action.&quot; Compared with this issue, for instance, the con-condemnation of the terms of the Peace Treaty was an intellectual judgment, sincere doubtless, but orthodox from the labour standpoint, and untouched by the note of conviction un-usual at conferences such as these, which was apparent in the case of the direct-action issue. It was, however, upon a resolution to condemn intervention in Russia that the question of direct action was debated, and this may have had a considerable influence upon the course of the debate. &apos; Sympathy with an economic and political revolution abroad, and the growing tendency towards a revolutionary use of industrial strength at home, met by chance in the same resolution, reacted upon each other, and produced an enthusiastic endorsement of the policy of the Triple Alliance. But this dovetailing of closely related foreign and domestic issues was largely fortuitous. Mr. Smillie would haye,-raised the debate on the first day upon a paragraph in the Executive Report, which placed respon-sibility for the new policy upon the Trade Unions concerned. Mi. Henderson, however, suggested that the main debate could more appropriately be raised upon the resolution against the intervention in Russia where direct action was expressly advocated, and this course was accordingly followed.  The interpretation put upon this postponement of the-(c 1825)  160  7/19  ii &amp; s
-debate by certain sections of the current press was inaccurate. It was not a rebuff for Mr. Smillie, but an amicable arrangement arrived at conversationally between him and Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson asserted that the reference back of the paragraph in the Executive Report would be taken as a censure on the Executive. Mr. Smillie disclaimed a desire to censure the Executive, and offered to withdraw his motion upon a guarantee that an opportunity would be given later of raising the question for discussion. This was given readily and the motion, withdrawn. Mr.. Smillie had, at least, gained the knowledge that the support of the Conference would be with him in the main debate. Such rebuff as existed was purely of a tactical nature, and in no way affected the substantial issue.The relation between the political Labour Party and the movement for direct action &quot;was by no means clearly defined, and did not become so in the course of the debate. There is no absolute condemnation of one side by the other. First, from the standpoint of the leaders of the Triple Alliance: Mr. Robert Williams has no clearly defined conception of the aims and methods of the movement, but his weight with the Conference did not appear to be great, and in the face of opposition from Messrs. Tillett, Sexton and Havelock Wilson, the Transport Federation is probably from this point of view as from most others the weakest member of the Alliance. Mr. Smillie stands midway between Mr. Williams and Mr. Hodges. He is more indifferent to constitutional considerations than his fellow representative of the Miners Federation. He accepts three propositions as axiomatic : (i) that the workers were deceived at the last election; (ii) that where leaders do not give a, lead, it is constitutional for the rank and file to take initiative; (iii) that there is no line of demarcation between political and industrial affairs. His attitude is to present an ultimatum to the legislature and use the industrial weapon in default of capitulation-. He rather ignores than opposes the Labour Party in the House. Mr. Bromley, who seconded Mr. SmilhVs motion to refer back the paragraph dealing with the topic in the Executive Report, first clearly enunciated the ideal of political and industrial power. He explained that it was not intended to divorce industrial from political power, but by the organisation of the former to enhance the latter, so that the Labour Party, when it made its demands upon the floor of the House would be able to command attention by reason of the external backing thus provided. Only in the event of the political party refusing this co-ordination would the Triple Alliance be driven back upon itself. Mr, Hodges therefore would aim at transmitting industrial into political power, not by tine machinery of the franchise, but by substituting for a preponderance of votes in the House a minority powerfully backed by industrial organisations from without. From the standpoint of the Labour Party, the Presidential address certainly characterised direct action in this connection as &quot; an innovation in this country which few responsible leaders would welcome,&quot; but it continued : It is perhaps difficult and even unwise to adopt a hard and fast attitude without reservations, and without reference to circumstances of the moment.&quot; The paragraph in the Executive Report merely lays responsibility for the movement upon the Trade Unions whose finances must bear the strain. On the third day, Mr. Clynes opposed the resolution in favour of direct action upon the Russian situation. His attitude is simply that labour failed in the election because the workers were not all ready and well organised enough to secure a political triumph. He opposed direct industrial action as a substitute for political strength upon such &quot; purely political issues as those contained in the resolution.&quot; On the other hand, he allowed it for industrial disputes. The phrase, &quot; such purely political issues &quot; may be significant. He did not refer to the type of case upon which Mr. Smillie laid great,stress in his reference to the nationalisation of the mines. The hearing granted to Mr. Clynes was subject to consider-able interruption until he appealed for fair-play. This was granted for the remainder of this speech, which was cordially received, though not with such applause as would imply that it carried any considerable weight with the Conference.Of the other opponents of the movement upon the floor of the meeting, Mr. Sexton carried no weight at all, having roused the impatience of the delegates by the facetious character of his opening remarks. Mr. Brace commanded attention by his appeal to tfte Unions to avoid the &quot; slippery slope &quot; of the new policy, but again the applause was rather given to the forceful address of the speaker, and when he had resumed his seat one did not feel that he had carried weight. Mr. Tilletfs oratory in the same way commanded attention but so far as the audience was vocal or given to applause the result was similar to that which followed Mr. Brace&apos;s remarks. Mr. Hodges and Mr. Smillie held the Conference completely without a note of dissent or interruption during their speeches. In one respect both Mr. Clynes and Mr. Brace went further than the Executive of the party. They would not even put responsibility upon the Unions for direct action on political issues, but would rather demand an absolute condemnation by the Conference of such a course being taken at all.
On the whole, therefore, there is a strong tendency in the forward movement to find a modus vivendi with, and even to seek expression through, the constitutional party; and there is no definite condemnation of the movement as a whole by this party. Whether the rapprochement becomes closer in the future will depend upon specific issues, and appears more likely to result upon a political issue with industrial implications, such as-nationalisation. In the field, of pure politics, however, the answer is more definite at the moment, since the forward movement is to some extent regarded by the constitutional party as a menace to its ambition to form a government within the next few years.On the question of the general significance of the resolution at Southport, it may be said that it would be easy to give exaggerated weight to it. It was a two to one majority on a card vote, but this must be discounted by (i) the great personal prestige which Mr. Smillie and Mr. Hodges undoubtedly held, as a result of their activities in connection with the Coal Commission ; (ii) the absence of practical executive responsibility in the Confer-ence, which is a political body, whereas the programme is one for Trade Union action ; (iii) the absence of an effective debate upon the question. The vote was called for at a stage when little discussion had taken place. The whole proceeding was more in the nature of a &quot; demonstration &quot; than the launching of a new industrial movement. There are in addition, of course, practical considerations connected with Labour organisation as it at present exists, which all tend in the direction of weakening any effect which such a resolution could have. The Triple Alliance has secured that the &quot;National Executive shall approach the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress with a view to effective action upon a specific issue. It may be assumed that the Executive of the Labour Party will not move in the matter otherwise than formally, so that the whole question remains over for consideration by the Trades Union Congress to be held&apos; at Glasgow in September. The Parliamentary Committee of this body have already declined to call a special conference to consider the programme of the Triple Alliance, and it is not probable that this decision will be reversed. Mr. Gosling, the delegate of the Parliamentary Com-mittee to the recent conference, in fact, spoke of the issue as pending a settlement at Glasgow. .- But, apart from this, there are certain almost insuperable difficulties in the way of an effective general stoppage arising from the fact that such action can only be taken through a supreme body having sufficient controlling power, and this does riot exist.The chief importance of the resolution, therefore, would appear to be that it has given to the Triple Alliance an endorsement of their policy by the labour movement generally, and its results from this point of view will be of interest. So far as the words uttered at the Conference reveal the minds of the leaders, they have different conceptions of tlieir own policy, and; it may be that the Alliance will continue to attempt to secure legislative activity in the Commons by the mere threat of industrial action, and by this means trans-mute industrial into political power through the parliamentary organ of the Labour Party. How far their activities remain confined to this will probably be determined, as has been already suggested, by how far this policy continues to be fruitful. The debate upon- the Parliamentary Report supports this conclusion. There was no suggestion in this debate that direct action should be substituted for parliamentary. The criticism proceeded upon the usual lines of charging, members with non-attendance at divisions, and&apos; the- failure to adopt an irreconcilable attitude in the House. With regard to specific charges such as lack of attendance, Mr. Adamson dealt with them by giving them &quot; the direct lie,&quot; and after a little up-hill work, secured full support of the Conference for the Report. Similarly the proposal of the- Executive to raise the contributions of affiliated societies from 2d. to 3d. per member,, was withdrawn after an opposition Based purely upon financial considerations. The large increase of expenditure upon political activity foreshadowed by Mr. Henderson, produced no remarks indicative of disillusionment with political work; Though the personal prestige of the advocates of direct action far exceeded that of the constitutional party, the policy of political activity in no way received a direct check.(C 1825)
Part II-Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Ex-Officer and Training Vacancies.The system of training vacancies, whereby men desiring professional and business training are enabled to receive it under the Training Grants Scheme in actual professional offices or business establishments^ is of primary importance in the resettlement of ex-officers and especially of those without previous experience or qualifications. It is, there-fore, a matter of special concern that the facilities offered by employers to candidates for training under the Government scheme have by no means satisfied expectations. The number of ex-service candidates who had applied for such training up to the 24th June was over 15,500. j The number of training vacancies notified to the Appointments Depart-ment up to the same date was under 6,800, and of these many have been withdrawn, filled by applicants other than those under the Training Grants Scheme, cr in other ways rendered ineffectual. It is probably not an under-statement to say that for every three applicants for professional and business training, there is only one vacancy available at the present time. A recent investigation as to alleged delays in the operation of the Training Grants Scheme shows that in three districts alone of the Appointments Depart-ment 799 cases could not be dealt with on account of the lack of suitable training vacancies. Fuller publicity to bring home to employers the importance of their co-operation in this matter is contemplated, but it is clear that the change in the situation must be one of a marked character if it is to meet the urgency of the demand.The reluctance of employers to offer and keep open vacancies for the purposes of the Training Grants Scheme is, in certain directions, capable of explanation. As regards the engineering industry, for example, a number of difficulties have been encountered. An unexpected obstacle has been met in connection with the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, which appears to provide that the standard wage, including bonus according to the candidate^ age, shall be paid to every apprentice, learner, or pupil. These provisions have been interpreted as covering trainees under the Grants Scheme, and this view has been confirmed by a decision of Mr. Justice Pirn in Dublin. If this interpretation is main-tained, it must necessarily exercise a very adverse influence on the placing of candidates in engineering firms, as few employers will find it practicable to receive pupils without previous knowledge if, from the commencement of their training, they are to be paid an uneconomic salary. The matter is to be referred to the National Trade Advisory Committee at an early date.An unfortunate situation which has been developing for some time in consequence of the attitude of various engineering trade unions, has recently become acute. These unions have, from time to time, expressed objection to the introduction of trainees of the officer class in the engineering works, an objection dating even from the introduction of con-convalescent serving officers placed under the Officers&apos; University and Technical Classes Scheme, and continuing as regards discharged officers placed under the Training Grants Scheme. A number of training vacancies in electrical and motor engineering, aircraft production and printing have in the past been suspended owing to the attitude of the trade unions. On the 21st June, the matter was brought to a head by a cessation of work on the part of the employees of Messrs. Richardson, Westgarth &amp; Co., Ltd., Hartlepool, on account of the introduction, for training in the works, of a number of young ex-officers aged from 19 to 24. The men&apos;s objection is apparently based mainly on a misconception of the nature of the training intended, which has led them to fear that the trainees would compete with apprenticed members of the trade unions or with skilled operatives. But in this case it was also alleged that, in order to introduce these trainees, eight men had been discharged, including a number of ex-soldiers. A formal complaint was lodged by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers on the matter. At the same time, a similar situation arose at the works of the Crosthwaite Engineering and Furance Company, Ltd., Leeds, where members of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders ceased work on account of the introduction under the Training Grants Scheme of a trainee aged 20. As the result of a conference on the 23rd, presided over by Sir David Shackleton, representations were made to the Amalga-mated Society of Engineers on behalf of the Department, explaining that trainees under the Training Grants Scheme were &quot; undergoing training with a view to their acquiring sufficient technical knowledge to qualify them for the commercial and office side of the business, and that this training cannot qualify them to compete with any apprenticed member of trade unions or with any skilled operatives.&quot;  Similar representations were made at Manchester* See this Report for the week ending the 5th March, p. 3, and for the week ending the 7th May, p. 3. f A number of these applicants are still undemobilised, and others are probably unacceptable for training; but these may be offset by those for whom the Educational and Agricultural authorities lack vacancies.
Part III.-Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.The Treaty of Peace.There is little that is new in the discussions in the papers reviewed this week upon the Treaty of Peace, the signature of which was pending when these papers were written. The I.L.P. organs are unanimous in their condemnation of the Peace. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; prophesies that the treaty will not endure, because of the lack of moral force behind it. In its view, it is a challenge to democracy, and half Europe (i.e., Russia, Hungary and the German and Italian extremists) has taken up the challenge. Mr. E. D. Morel, in this paper, maintains that the treaty is an outrage on humanity and a betrayal of the men who have fallen in the war. President Wilson, he thinks, is &quot; the most piteous of all human figures in the world.&quot; He concludes that the history of the Paris Conference proves that Society, as at present constituted, can make no progress. Mr. Norman Angell, also in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; maintains that the signature &quot;of German delegates to the treaty is worthless, because it was a forced signature and, therefore, in his opinion, legally and morally valueless. He suggests that the real object of the signature of the treaty is to conceal from the peoples of the Allied countries the existence of a more real treaty(C 1825) A ito the Secretary of the Ironfounders&apos; Society, who, however, was not prepared to order a resumption of work pending inquiry. It was, therefore, decided that in both cases the trainees whose position was in dispute should be asked to withdraw voluntarily. The unions concerned have been invited to confer in London with representatives of the Ministry in order that the position of trainees under the Training Grants Scheme may be fully explained. The dispute at Hartlepool has been settled, for the time being, by the volun-tary withdrawal of the candidates. The situation at Leeds is still obscure as the head of the firm concerned is not willing to agree to the withdrawal of the trainee and has expressed a desire to contest the matter with the union. The withdrawal of the candidates in each case, although carried out on the advice of the Ministry, has been voluntary, and the Ministry has taken no responsibility for the step pending the conference which is to be held next week. Labour trouble of this kind, although it has occurred so far only on a limited scale, cannot but exercise disastrous results as regards offers of training vacancies from engineering firms, where the general depression of employment had necessarily resulted in decreased prospects of employment for senior staff. In the negotiations now a-foot, it is anticipated that the bodies concerned will arrive at a true appreciation of the difference between apprentice training and the training of ex-service candidates for the higher ranks of the profession in order to repair, so far as possible, the nation&apos;s loss of trained and educated men owing to casualties, suspension of education or impairment of professional efficiency. If, however, the present attitude of the unions is maintained, the Department is likely to find almost insuperable difficulty in opening up training ground for the candi-dates still awaiting consideration.Minor difficulties, over which the Department has no control, have also occurred. The preliminary steps necessary before these vacancies can be filled are apt to be somewhat prolonged. The candidate put forward has to be approved by the Interviewing Boards set up by the District Selective Committees, and the conditions of the vacancy itself must be approved by the same authority. The number of Interviewing Boards is now over 93, with a membership comprising 1,462 professional and business men. Although they have held in all over 370 meetings, they have as yet only touched the fringe of the work assigned to them. As the services of members of these Boards are voluntary, it is not possible for the Department to make undue demands on their time. A further cause of delay arises from the fact that nearly every firm or employer not unnaturally wishes to interview candidates submitted by the Department for the training vacancies which they offer. In view, therefore, of the fact that no premium is paid by the Department, it is not sur-prising that vacancies tend to be filled before the proper candidate can be put forward and finally approved under the Training Grants Scheme.Making all allowance, however, for such difficulties as these, it remains true that the assistance offered by employers has so far proved disappointing and must be extended considerably if the work of training ex-officers for professional and business careers is to be carried out successfully.
between the party of reaction in Germany and the &quot; secret junta of Paris.&quot; The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; thinks that the treaty is too bad to be carried out. This I.L.P. opinion is shared, to some extent, by the &quot; Nation.&quot; The Versailles ceremony, thinks the &quot; Nation,&quot; is the worst scene enacted since the signature of the Brest-Litovsk treaty. The &quot; Nation &quot; suggests that the peace of the world in the immediate future will depend upon the course of the race between the consequences of the treaty and the efforts of the victors to repair their mistakes. In particular, the &quot; Nation&quot; criticises an alleged provision of the treaty, that the plebiscite in part of Upper Silesia shall only be taken after the &quot; Workers&apos; Councils &quot; in the plebiscite area &quot; have been dissolved and their members evacuated &quot; (but the &quot; Nation &quot; appears to have been misinformed as to the provisions of the treaty).* The &quot; New Statesman &quot; thinks that the treaty must be revised because it cannot be enforced. Germany, it says, is united in its abhorrence of the treaty and, because the Allies are, in its opinion, by no means equally united in its favour, it thinks a passive resistance movement on the part of Germany against the treaty would be able to destroy its&apos;effect. This paper suggests that we must give the Germans something to hope for and something to lose, before threats of action on our part would have any force in securing the fulfilment of the treaty. On the other hand, &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; gives his considered judgment upon the treaty. He confesses that he does not think the treaty ideal, but maintains that there is much good in it, and that this good is capable of expansion. In &quot; Justice &quot; Mr. Robert Arch attacks an article by Mr. E. D. Morel, which the latter has written for the &quot; U.D.C.&quot;The League of Nations.Discussion of the League of Nations is intimately connected with the discussion on the Treaty of Peace. The &quot; Nation &quot; does not see that the admittance of Germany into the League will in any way improve her position, or end her isolation. This paper discusses in detail the constitution of the League, and maintains that the League as it stands is an insurance for every unjust gain won by bartering at Paris. The &quot; New Age &quot; maintains that the League of Nations is in effect an Anglo-American Alliance, and then endeavours to demonstrate on economic grounds that such an alliance can never be a strong one. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; professes to share the hopes that have been expressed in the League, but pending its creation and the adherence to it of the United States and the admission of Germany, it says that its hope must be in the coming power of democracy, which may breathe into the form of the League the spirit of European democracy.Germany.&quot; The Call &quot;ideals with the new German Government. Herr Bauer, the new German Prime Minister, is described as.a trade union member of the Majority Socialist Party, and &quot; therefore, more reactionary than his predecessors.&quot; The object of the new Govern-ment, in the opinion of this paper, is to gain a respite against the true revolution. V The Call&quot; prophesies that this Government will be swallowed up by a counter-revolution, upon which will then follow the real social revolution. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; however^ confidently expects a Communist revolution in Germany without this latter preliminary. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; welcomes any German Government that ends the rule of Scheidemann, and the &quot; Clarion &quot; reiterates its lack of faith in German democracy.Russia and Hungary.Mr. F. Willis in &quot; The Call &quot; deals with the question of international action in order to save the Russian revolution. He maintains that the habit of thought for generations of the whole Russian people has been one of revolt against its Government, and describes the theory that this Russian people needs to be delivered from Soviet tyranny by foreign armies as the &quot; most impudent lie in history.&quot; He calls upon British workers to come to the help of what he describes as the &quot; International Socialist Co-operative Common-wealth.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowett in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; maintains that the I.L.P. must make the Russian question the centre point of its propaganda and repeats in this con-nection both the arguments he used in this paper on 30th May, and those which Mr. Norman Angell used in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; of the same date.f &quot; Roy Roy,&quot; in *&apos; For-ward,&quot; quotes from recent issues of the &quot; New Europe &quot; to refute Mr. Brailsford&apos;s account of the Hungarian revolution, and calls for more information to be published by the Govern-ment upon negotiations between the Moscow Government and the Allies. The &quot; Demo-crat&quot; has an analysis of Russian Socialist parties and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;* See gl of the Annex&apos;to Article 88 (Cmd. 153, p. 52). f Cf. Report, 4th June, p. 4.
publishes a third instalment of Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs interview with a Russian who left Moscow on the 20th May.*Other.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; expresses the opinion that with the recent change in Government, Italy has ceased to be the Italy of the Allies. He also mentions a report of an exhumation by the Serbians of the bodies of the Serajevo murderers, to give them a more honourable resting place, in order to prove that Serbia was implicated in the murder of the Archduke Charles, which was the occasion of the war. He complains that the International has lost opportunity after opportunity in the recent months of asserting its importance, and calls upon socialists to take a wider view of European events, and not to confine themselves merely to the Russian question. He asserts that Germany ought to go through a further revolution and looks forward to Germany and Italy joining with Russia and Hungary to confront the Capitalist Allies./(B) Home Affairs.Coal Industry Commission Reports.Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report meets with the approval of the mass of the papers. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that the Government is pledged to carry out his recommenda-tions, and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; confesses that it &quot; can hardly help feeling that the question is now settled.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; confines itself to the warning that, if endeavours to put the recommendations into force are resisted, there is grave danger of immediate upheaval and chaos. Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;s Report does not seem to be considered by these papers as worthy of much attention : the &quot; New Statesman &quot; dismisses his scheme as unworkable, and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; says it need not be seriously con-sidered. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; argues that the report of the representatives of the coal owners falls short even of the Whitley Council scheme. . &quot; The Call &quot; insists that control by the miners of their industry is as important an issue as nationalisation and approves of Mr. Sankey&apos;s Report but with the reservations of the three miners&apos;x leaders. The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; adopts a similar position : it expresses the opinion that a capitalist state is a controller of industry no more satisfactory than private capitalists. This paper puts forward the thesis that the problem is one of administration rather than of ownership. It differs from Mr. Justice Sankey in that it thinks that the prevalent unrest in the coal-fields is due merely to the geographical and economic concentration of the coal industry : education, it thinks, is not so much the cause of the unrest as a remedy which must be employed in.the future to counteract the evils of mere State socialism.! Nevertheless, these papers are pleased with the report because they think that it marks an important step forward, both in its actual recommendations and in the procedure by which they have been arrived at. The report, they think, not only makes more easily attainable the nationalisation of other industries, but the Commission is a precedent which shows how such nationalisation may be achieved. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; is the solitary exception. This paper maintains that the reservations of the miners&apos; leaders strike at the kernel of Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s scheme, which would, in the opinion of this paper, prevent the miners ever taking part in a sympathetic strike, and would exploit their labour for the benefit of the income-tax payers. J It refers to these &quot; infamous proposals &quot; and suggests that they owe their infamous character to being prepared in collaboration with the Government.Mr. Asquith.References to Mr. Asquith&apos;s speeches at Leeds on the 19th June are many and un-complimentary. The ex-Premier, concludes the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; has no message to fit the times. &quot; As a post-war politician he is a hopeless failure.&quot; He is indifferent to the most important current problems, which are, in the opinion of this paper, the coal mines problem, the Peace and Russia. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; pass similar judgments. &quot; The Call &quot; is, in a sense, more respectful: &quot; As a capitalist administrator Mr. Asquith is more clever, suave, but in the last resort more callous than most.&quot;* Cf. Report, 18th June, p. 5.f Cf Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report, $XXXI (Cmd. 210, p. 11).,X This seems to be founded on Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report, gLVII,/ (Cmd. 210, p. 18). (C 1825) A 4
Labour Party, Trade Union Congress, and Triple Alliance.The work of the Parliamentary Labour Party continues to be unfavourably noticed in these papers. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; quotes at length and with obvious approval an article from the &quot; North Eastern Daily Gazette &quot; which deals with the loss the Parlia-mentary Party suffered when Messrs. Snowden, Macdonald and Jowett were defeated at the polls. The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks the Party suffers from lack of dynamic power and moral force. The &quot; Clarion &quot; quotes from the report of Labour Party Executive to the South-port Conference a passage which reiterates the Party&apos;s belief that this country shared responsibility for the outbreak of war ; and&apos;asserts that so long as the Party maintains this belief it will achieve no electoral success. Colonel Wedgwood, M.P., in an article in &quot; Forward,&quot; remarks upon what he describes as the peculiar composition of the present House of Commons. With regard to the Southport Conference itself the I.L.P. papers contain nothing more than reports of the first day&apos;s proceedings, but some of the other papers refer to the relations between the T.U.C. and the Labour Party. &quot; Justice &quot; main-tains that all matters connected with so-called &quot; direct action &quot; are matters for the T.U.C. and comments adversely on the fact that the executive clauses of so many of the resolutions on the agenda of the Conference recommend &quot; direct action.&quot; The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; dealing with the Swansea Conference of the Transport Workers,* says that the proceedings of the conference show that the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. acted wisely in not taking any action upon the &quot; Southport Resolutions &quot; beyond the interview with Mr. Bonar Law, and prove that these resolutions had not constitutional authority and procedure behind them. The &quot; Nation &quot; attributes the deliberate manner in which the Triple Alliance is following up these same resolutions to divided counsels, but warns the Government not to rely too much on this. Mr. A. L. Thompson, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; describes his visit to the N.U.R. Conference at Plymouthf and expresses his displeasure at the prominence which political matters assumed in the discussion. Mr. Thompson thinks that these political discussions were at a low standard and that, in any case, they were out of place at a trade union meeting.Industrial Unrest and Economic Theory.Mr. W. I. Hoxby, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; maintains that the remedy for Industrial Unrest is for the Government to restore the confidence of the manufacturers in the commercial future, lack of which he says is causing unemployment (to encourage the import of raw materials) to legislate on the hours and wages questions (he thinks shorter hours and higher wages will not reduce production) and to encourage a complete estab-lishment of Whitley Councils. Mr. W. A. Appleton, in the same paper, insists that more production for the overseas market is an imperative necessity if this country is to retain its commercial supremacy. Mr. Charles Jesson, M.P., in the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; insists in a similar manner on the need for increased production. The &quot; New Age &quot;preserves its individuality by asserting that not decreasing production, but decreasing consumption is the danger. Mr. E. C. Fairchild contributes to &quot; The Call&quot; an answer to Mr. Bryan&apos;s articles. J He maintains that the essential difference between Russia and England prevents the possibility of the success here of &quot; Soviet &quot; government, and he would seem to regard its success in Russia as somewhat mythical. He acknowledges that Parliament and the Trade Unions are slow instruments of progress, but he thinks they are the only possible means through which to achieve the socialisation of ownership and control. Only Parliament, he says, has authority over the Army and the Civil Service, which he regards as the essence of the capitalist state. He refers to the &quot; rank and file convention idea &quot; as the &quot; innocent babbling of men whose passion for notoriety exceeds their acquaintance with the working class &quot; : and expresses the opinion that the true line of attack on the Triple Alliance is not upon their action in not yet calling a strike upon the Russian question, but in not asking by means of a ballot the opinions of their members on the matter. :,Other.The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; makes a further criticism of the rule that no person may receive Unemployment Donation who was not employed for a certain length of time in 1918. This paper suggests that this rule is unfair, for example, on a woman who was widowed, say, in August, 1918, and thus compelled to commence working for the first time. The &quot; Democrat&quot; maintains that the agitation against the&apos; Income Tax on low incomes is mistaken: it believes that the workers should contribute a fair share to the revenue, and points out that the Income Tax. is a better way. for this to be done.* Cf. Report, 11th June, p. 9.t Cf. Reports, 18th June, p. 10, and 25th June, p. 10.j Cf. Reports, 11th June, p. 6, and 18th June, p. 7.
than indirect taxes on necessaries. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; repeats his recommendation that reform of the Income Tax should proceed by raising the abate-ment level to its former amount and then by increasing the allowances for wives and children/1&apos; &quot; Justice &quot; asserts the importance of the continuance of the Food Control,, and Mr. Ben Tillett, in the same paper, calls for the discontinuance of Liquor Control.(2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement. Release of Derby Men.The &quot; Daily News &quot; (25th June) reports that a meeting of Eoyal Engineers stationed at Bedford, held on the 24th June, passed a resolution expressing disgust at the retention in the army of Derby men whose release had already fallen due. A demonstration followed, and the General in Command promised to inquire into the grievance.Part IV.-G-eneral Topics and District Reports. (1) General.Nationalisation.TJie question of nationalisation, rendered more immediately acute by the report of the Coal Commission, is arousmg keen controversy throughout the country. The Press devotes much space to reporting the propaganda taking place in favour of and in opposition to it. Meetings have been held or will shortly be held by the Unionist War Committee (which, it is reported, has been renamed &quot; Unionist Reconstruction Committee &quot;), the Coalition Liberals, the National Party and the &quot; Industrial Group &quot; to consider the problem. It is stated that the Parliamentary Coal Committee has drawn up a memorial, which it is circulating for signature, recording the opinion that the principle of nationalisa-tion has not been justified by the evidence laid before the Coal Commission, and that the policy of nationalisation as indicated in Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report is detrimental not only to the interests of the industries of the country but to the best interests of the general public, the workpeople and the consumers. The Huddersfield Chamber of Commerce on the 24th June passed unanimously a resolution strongly opposing any extension of Govern-ment control and, in particular, nationalisation of coal mines, and emphasising the fact that the Commission contained &quot; no properly appointed representatives of consumers.&quot; The General Purposes Committee of the British Commonwealth Union has passed a resolution, in general terms, hostile to nationalisation. It is reported that the leaders of the Miners&apos; Federation hold the view that the Government must accept the majority report of the Coal Commission. The opinion has been expressed that in the House of Commons the miners&apos; representatives will endeavour to probe the Governments intentions and that in the country a series of demonstrations will keep alive the demand for nationalisation. The Miners&apos; Federation meet at Keswick on 15th July for their annual, conference ; and this meeting, it is reported, will mark the start of a great propaganda. Further resolutions in favour of nationalisation passed by local miners&apos; organisations have been reported during the week.Labour Party Conference. .The 19th Annual Conference of the Labour Party was held at Southport on Wednesday,. 25th June, and the two following days. A preliminary meeting of the women&apos;s section&apos; was held on the 24th. The main feature of the Conference, the question of direct action, is dealt with in Part I of this Report.The Parliamentary Report, after a certain amount of criticism of the Labour members for inaction and non-attendance to divisions, was cordially adopted after Mr. Adamson&apos;s reply had been heard.Resolutions were passed with or without debate upon the following topics : Educa-tion, pensions and separation allowances, payment of members, women magistrates, work-ing hours, land nationalisation, unemployment, conscription, workmen s compensation, old age pensions, the Defence of the Realm Act, national finance, political and religious-prisoners, provisions for the blind, electoral reform, the Poor Law, State bonus, and fines-and deductions.(c .1825)* Of. Report, 21st May, p. 6.
The Executive Committee was directed to report upon control of industry, with refe-Tence to joint industrial councils, works and pit committees, co-partnership, and democratic management generally. The reception given to Mr. Marston, of the Police and Prison Officers Union, appeared cordial, and a resolution was passed that the Police Union be recognised by the Government.Foreign affairs were under consideration, chiefly upon a resolution moved by Mr. Macdonald, and seconded by Mr. Clynes, advocating speedy admission of Germany to the League of Nations, and revision of such parts of the treaty as are &quot; inconsistent with the statements made on behalf of the Allied Governments when the Armistice was made.&quot; It has been noted elsewhere, however, that the chief interest centred in Russia, the ground taken being nominally that of the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of another country, but in reality class-sympathy appears to be a considerable element in it.Resolutions were passed also upon the International, Egypt, the Polish treatment of Jews, the interception of French delegates, and the Blockade, expressive of Labour opinion.The fraternal delegates were Mr. Branting (Sweden), Mr. Renaudel (France), Mr. H. Gosling (Trade Union Congress), Mr. Camille Huysmans (The Internationale), Mr. W. H. Watkins (Co-operative Parliamentary Representative Council), Mrs. Annie Besant (India), and Italian and Belgian representatives. It was announced by Mr. Henderson that the delegates of the Labour and Socialist movements in Great Britain, France and Italy had decided that a general working-class demonstration should take place as an evidence of their determination to prevent the Governments adopting a reactionary policy, and under-taking military intervention in the affairs of other countries. On the 20th and 21st July, the working class in each of the countries named would hold its own demonstration in its own way, and at these demonstrations an identical resolution would be submitted, sending fraternal greetings to the working class movements of the other countries, giving a pledge in a spirit of solidarity to work unceasingly with them for the overthrow of militarism in all its forms throughout the world ; and welcoming the revolutions which have destroyed the old order in Russia, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere. It would further be declared that it is the duty of the working class in every country, with a view to stopping military operations against the Socialist republics of Europe, to demand action in the various Parlia-ments, and to bring whatever pressure it can command upon the governing authorities in the various countries. Mr. Henderson stated that, so far as this country was concerned, a meeting of the Executive would be held to prepare for the organisation of these demon-strations. It is reported that the demonstrations will take the form of great meetings to be held in all important centres of population on the 20th and 21st July for proposing the resolution. This demonstration, it may be mentioned, is to take the place of the 24-hour general strike mooted by the extremists in the British and Foreign Labour Movements.National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations.The National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations has now apparently been definitely formed. It probably represents an extension, already foreshadowed, of the movement inaugurated in the Amalgamation of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the National Employers&apos; Federation towards the end of 1918. The moving force behind it appears to be the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and Mr. Bryce, the Secretary of that Federation, is also its Secretary. This goes to suggest that as an organisation it will not be negligible, as a mere conglomeration of employers&apos; associations might prove to be, since it is built on a basis of the strongest organisation already existing. It only remains to be seen what area it will eventually embrace, and it may well be that this will be as wide as that covered by the Federation of British Industries, and that it will be the parallel organisation to that, for the purpose of dealing with Labour affairs. From the Government^ point of view one useful function which it may be able to perform is that of supplying a want hitherto very much felt, i.e., an organisation capable of speaking in the name of the employers&apos; side of industry in general and of taking upon itself, and conse-quently away from the Government, the onus of choosing representatives.Textile Workers.The dispute in the Cotton Trade, which, it was hoped, had been settled on the 23rd June, still continues owing to the action of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, who on the 24th June declined to accept the settlement made on the 23rd June and called for a special representative meeting to discuss the question. It was also decided that no mill already stopped should re-start until a decision had been reached. The Legislative Council of the United Textile Workers&apos; Association met at South/port on the 24th and decided to take a ballot of its members upon the terms, with
a recommendation for acceptance. Preston Provincial Operative Cotton Spinners met at Preston on the 27th. Strong dissatisfaction was expressed with the terms of the proposed settlement, especially with the 48-hour week, and the clause which makes the settlement binding for 18 months. The meeting decided, however, to instruct the delegates to the Spinners&apos; Amalgamation to vote for acceptance of the terms on the ground that they cannot do other than accept the decision of the General Council of the United Textile Workers&apos; Federation. At a special meeting of the Operative Cotton Spinners&apos; Amal-gamation on the 28th, it was decided not to accept the proposed terms of settlement, and not to return to work until the result of the ballot of the whole of the members of the United Textile Workers&apos; Association was heard. The Cardroom Operatives Amalgama-tion decided that its members should return to work on the 30th June. The Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Union requested a meeting with the employers on the 2nd July, and the employers agreed. At this meeting the Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association announced that they could not alter their decision to close the mills on 3rd July, but pointed out that this was in no sense a lock-out, but was due to force majeure, and was taken with a view to uniform action, and to avoid spasmodic stoppages from day to day owing to yarn supplies not being forthcoming. The conference ended without any progress towards a settlement being made.   &quot;Triple Alliance.A meeting of the Executive of the Triple Alliance at Southport on the 24th June passed a resolution expressing its profound disappointment at the attitude taken up by the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. with regard to the &quot; Southport Resolutions &quot; and convening a full delegate conference representing the constituent bodies of the Industrial Triple Alliance (to meet in London on 23rd July) to consider necessary action. A resolution was also passed for the whole Executive to wait upon the Government as a deputation with a view to raising the income-tax exemption to  250. *Conferences.The annual meeting of the National Council of Women was held at Leicester on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th June. Among the resolutions, One to the effect that no restrictions on the employment of women should be included in the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Bill was adopted. The work of women in the Labour Party was reviewed at a Conference in Southport on 24th June at which Miss Susan Lawrence presided. Two of the women , who gave evidence before the Coal Commission on baths and housing addressed the conference; Dr. Marion Phillips spoke on food control and Mrs. Despard on housing. Miss Lawrence attacked the Prime Minister and the &quot; militarist &quot; policy of the Government.The Amalgamated Engineering and Stores Association of the Post Office opened its third annual conference at Nottingham on 29th June. The CounciFs report referred most favourably to &quot; Whitleyism.&quot; Complaints were made of the hostility of the Electrical Trades Union. Post Office proposals for dealing with disabled ex-service men were criticised. The Council&apos;s report was adopted, this involving the acceptance of the Government scheme for the application of the Whitley principle to the Civil Service.The first annual conference of the new Association of Master Wheelwrights and Coach and Body Builders was held in Birmingham on 27th June. The conference proceeded to discuss an agenda dealing with a variety of technical matters, the principal object of which was to secure uniform action all over the country as to labour conditions and rates, workshop practice, and the elimination of price-cutting.Amalgamation.The Executive of the various General Workers Unions now negotiating for amalgama-tion met at York on the 2nd July to prepare a scheme for presentation to the. General Council of the National Federation of General Workers in Manchester on 14th and 15th August. The Welsh Administrative Council of the N.U.C. has rejected the terms of the S.W.M.F. for amalgamation, but negotiations are proceeding.Trade Unions.Commercial staffs in the shipbuilding and engineering trade at Glasgow haVe decided to form a Clyde centre of the Shipbuilding, Engineering and Steel Commercial Staffs&apos;&apos; Association, which seeks recognition from employers and the Government to act as the official mouthpiece of the commercial staffs and to obtain better conditions for them. The National Amalgamated Union of Labour reports an increase of 4,145 during the last quarter.  The Lace Dressers&apos; and Finishers&apos; Union held its first meeting in Nottingham
 for the women&apos;s and men&apos;s sections respectively on 23rd and 24 th instant. As a sequel to a dispute.between the Dockers&apos; Union and Messrs. Spillers &amp; Bakers, Limited (Cardiff), friction has arisen between the dockers (who contended that grain vessels should be loaded and discharged by casual labour) and the Workers&apos; Union (which claims that &quot; constant &quot; labour, i.e., employees of the firm who are members of the Workers&apos; Union) should be utilised. Fruit shopkeepers, flower traders and street traders in Glasgow are organising into a triple alliance, and they hope to extend their organisation over Scotland.Housing.As a result of the recent conference organised by the Royal Institute of British architectural-tects, a Building Industries Consultative Board has been set up to investigate the causes and remedies of the present unsatisfactory conditions of the industry. It consists of five architects, five surveyors, five master builders and five operatives. It is reported that the Iron and Steel Trades Federation has inaugurated a scheme to enable members to purchase their houses, 75 per cent, on the purchase price being lent on fair terms./ Over  20,000 has already been lent.Profit Sharing.The Burmah Oil Company, Limited, announced at its annual general meeting at Glasgow on the 26th instant, a scheme of profit sharing for its British employees.Conscription, Russia, Sc.The Executive Council of the National Sailors&apos;&quot;and Firemen&apos;s Union has passed a resolution to take no part in this Triple Alliance Conference on Russia and Conscription, and asserting that the members of the Union will not be bound by any of the resolutions of the conference. The Workers&apos; Socialist Federation demonstrated in Trafalgar Square on the 29th June against &quot; the continued war &quot; in Russia. The London District Council of the National Union of General Workers passed a resolution protesting against the*terms of the Peace, and pledged itself to do all in its power to alter them.A protest against British naval and military intervention in Russia has been signed, among other by Lord Ashton of Hyde, Mr. Sydney Arnold, Lord Henry Cavendish Bentinck, Mr. Sydney Webb and Mr. Edwin Cannan (see also under Conferences and Triple&apos; Alliance).44-hour WedhA 44-hour week has been obtained by Durham Municipal Employees, Midland District Building Operatives (winter only), and Glasgow Dressmakers. Demands for a 44-hour week have also been made by Birmingham jBuilding Trade Operatives (summer hours) and Liverpool Coopers and by the Scottish Operative Bakers&apos; Union.Income Tax.Neath and Avon Valley miners decided on 28th June to pay income tax on Sankey Award money up to 5th April. North Shields branch of the Boilermakers Society have passed a resolution in favour of an increase of the income tax exemption to  250.Over 200 men, principally boilermakers and dock workers, were summoned at West Ham yesterday for arrears of income tax.Co-operation.The Co-operative Wholesale Society is proposing to purchase lands and buildings in Leeds with a view to developing its clothing industry. Members of several working men&apos;s clubs in Huddersfield affiliated to the Club and Institute Union have bought a brewery by means of which they expect to supply beer to about 20,000 members of 52 local branches.The South Wales Branch of the Working Men&apos;s Club and Institute Union has bought a brewery for  20,000, the capital being fully subscribed in  1 shares. Beer will be supplied to the affiliated clubs at the lowest possible price.Industrial Unrest.The Joint Committee of Employers and Employed formed under the auspices of the North London Manufacturers&apos; Association, and presided over by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, issued its final report on the 26th instant. Among its recommendations are : (a) labour (including both hand and brain workers and management) to be admitted to a share in the control of each business by means of democratically-elected works councils, &amp;c.; (6) productive capital to be limited to a pre-ordained rate of preferential interest, and final net divisible profits to be equally divided between proprietors and workers.
Court of Arbitration.During the week ending 28th June, 15 cases have been heard by the Court in London.(2) District Reports.London and Souih-Eastem.Unemployment. The downward tendency of unemployment continues. The reduction, in the number of recipients of out-of-work donation is largely due to the revision, of donation policies, but arises also to some extent from an improved outlook in trade generally. Local Employment Committees are pressing upon local authorities the necessity of expedition in carrying out public works.South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The decrease of unemployment has been maintained, but at a slower pace.Resettlement. The chief factors retarding resettlement are transport difficulties and lack of housing accommodation. Barges are reported to be lying idle at Enfielcl which might profitably be used for relieving congestion.The complaints from this Division as to transport difficulties are reported from almost every part of the country. Particulars of specific cases are being forwarded to the special sub-committee appointed by the Railway Executive Committee to look into the subject.South-Western.Unemployment. The reduction in the numbers of unemployed continues, but the decrease shown in the latest returns is considerably less than during previous weeks.Resettlement. Delay in transport and congestion at railway, stations are more or less general complaints.West Midlands.Unemployment Slight increases of unemployment are recorded in seven districts but there is a general decrease over the whole division.Resettlement-There is a shortage of bar iron in the chain making industry, of railway trucks for the firebricks and fireclay industry and of steel plates at the Midland Iron Works, Donnington.Building labour is scarce. On the Exchange Registers of some of the largest areas there is a complete absence of building labour applicants.It is alleged that motor car manufacturers are combining and endeavouring to restrict the output of finished cars until the excess profits tax is withdrawn.General. Protests are being made by many labour organisations in the Black Country against the amount of overtime which is being worked.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment.&apos; At Lincoln and Ilkeston unemployment shows a tendency to increase but over the whole division there is a gradual reduction.Resettlement. Lack of housing accommodation is one of the chief limiting factors to the development of industry. It is suggested that the huts belonging to the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions should be used, for relieving congested housing conditions.General. The whole of the North Sea fishing fleet is now affected by the strike of the Hull trawlers.The ironfounders in a Leeds firm struck a week ago against the employment of a demobilised soldier under the Officers&apos; Training Grants Scheme. The Ironfounders&apos;&apos; Society have now threatened a strike of all their members in Leeds unless the ex-soldier is withdrawn.  Trouble over the employment of trainees has also arisen at Otley.Trade unionists have&apos;demanded the withdrawal of 300 discharged soldiers employed on semi-skilled work by Messrs. Charles Roberts &amp; Co., Ltd., Wakefield. The firm state, that if they are compelled to accede to this demand they will close down the works.Norih-Western.Unemployment. The largest decrease of unemployment in the country is shown by this division, but the number of unemployed in the engineering industry is again increasing.
Resettlement. There is a shortage of labour in the readstone quarrying industry. Complaint is made from Warringiton of the restrictions upon the importation from the United States of glass bottles for the perfume industry. It is stated that no English manufacturer can or will undertake to supply the special kind of bottles required.Difficulties are being encountered with some of the trade unions in connection with the Government scheme for the employment of ex-service men.General. The position at Liverpool Docks is serious on account of the dockers&apos; per-sistent refusal to work overtime and the shortage of carting and. railway facilities. The workers in the furnishing trade at Manchester have struck on questions of wages. This strike is likely to have a prejudicial effect on the building trade.Northern.Unemployment. There is a decline of unemployment over the whole division, but there has been a large increase of unemployment in the engineering and ironfounding industries, chiefly in the Cleveland and Tyneside areas.Resettlement. Men are leaving whinstone quarries to take up work in limestone quarries owing to the exclusion of the former from the Sankey Award. This will have the effect of reducing the supply of roadstone and reducing the employment of men engaged upon road repairs.The uncertainty occasioned by the Coal Commission^ Eeport on Nationalisation has had the effect of holding up the construction of works by the Nitrogen By-Products Company, Workington, which were expected to absorb about 4,000 workers. The company had been formed to take over the St. Helens Colliery and land adjoining, including coke ovens and byproducts plant.There are serious complaints of the difficulties of railway transport.General. The strike of men employed on maintenance plant in iron and steel works on the 44-hour week question continues, but negotiations for a settlement are proceeding.Wales.Unemployment. &apos;Wales is the only division of the country which shows an increase of unemployment. This for the moment is chiefly due to the closing down of the Dowlais iron works during holidays.Serious unemployment is anticipated, however, in West Wales and the Swansea areas.In Swansea the Mond Nickel Company, Limited, are discharging about 900 men, owing to depression of trade and a large accumulation of stocks.General. The chief features of industrial unrest are (1) the repudiation by the tinplate workers of the temporary agreement as to wages and hours arrived at a fortnight ago by the Joint Industrial Council; (2) an embargo on certain working hours by the dock pilots, boatmen and riggers at Bristol Channel ports and a strike by these workers at Barry ; and (3) a threat to strike by the men who came under the South Wales and Monmouthshire steel sliding scale agreement.Scotland.Unemployment. Unemployment is declining generally over Scotland; in only two places (Clydebank and Stirling) is there even a slight increase. The state of the jute industry is becoming satisfactory again. In the Northern ports there is a good deal of unemployment among fishermen, as their industry is not yet fully revived. The granite industry in Aberdeen is handicapped by a shortage of skilled labour ; granite is actually being imported into this city.Resettlement. There is a shortage of steel plates for shipbuilding at Paisley, and of drawn steel wire at Perth.Building labour is scarce in some parts of Scotland. The need for additional housing is urgent in Alloa, where the Forth Shipbuilding Company require 1,000 men, but no accommodation is at present available.General-A deadlock is threatened in the Scottish baking trade over the demand by the workers for a week of 44 hours instead of 51 hours as at present. On the North-East Coast a critical situation has arisen owing to differences which have occurred between the herring fishermen and the curers with regard to the price of herrings landed at the ports.
Part V.-Disputes. (a) Involving a Stoppage of Work Textile Workers (see Part IV). Engineers.At the Hartlepool engineering works of Messrs. Richardson, Westgarth &amp; Co., members of the A.S.E. have been on strike against the employment of army officers who are being trained by the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labour.

M. The strike at Loughborough has also ended on the same terms, plus a 461-hour week.Carnarvon master builders have, under protest, granted the demand of their workmen for rates of Is. 5d. and Is. Id., and the strike has ended.At Lincoln the master builders have agreed to carry out the arrangement which the Court of Arbitration declined to ratify. All work with the exception of Government contracts will, therefore, be resumed.In Dublin 2,000 operatives are on strike owing to a demarcation dispute between carpenters and labourers, and in Limerick 400 operatives are on strike for a 47-hour week and higher pay.Dock and Harbour Workers.Serious delay in shipping is stated to have been caused by the strikes of boatmen, dock-gatemen, &amp;c, in the Bristol Channel.Bakers.In Rhondda and Pontypridd and at the Tollington Park and Stoke Newington branches of Messr.;.
