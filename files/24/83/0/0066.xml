H This Document is the Prooertv o!* i&apos;  - - ...f, .His Britannic M^esty&apos;a Qovernn^)Ju IT I C IP A L   JL.3G TlQJOimiORMJDUM. BY   TH3S; MINIS^R   OF   HEALTH.In January the Homi Affairs Committee decided not to proceed with a Bill requiring the reflection of all Members cf&apos;Local Authorities.Since then the situation has been materially altered by the passing of the Housing. Bill.     We have had.a good opportunity of estimating the probable rate of progress of Bcrough Councils with regard to housing schemes, and evidenae is unanimous that whereac-.--in some boroughs progress is being made, in others there is a lamentable absence of energy and activity.By reason of emergency Statutes there have been no municipal eleotions since 1914.   Normally one third of the Councillors retire each year, but many of the present Councillors   have not faced their constituents for seven years. In the normal course one third of the Councillors of every Borough will go out of office next November but the, other two-thirds (who have already had five or six years&apos; office) will not go out until 1920 and 1921 respectively, unless a Bill is passed on the lines now proposed.The best way of vitalising .the backward Councils is by getting pressure from local public opinion.     ft all Councillors knew that they would have to face their constituencies-uents this autumn they would be mere likely to display real activity, for the municipal elections will be fought largely on the progress made locally with housing schemes.
The principal argument against a(. complete now election this year hae &quot;been that it might lead to the election of too many extremiste and would break the continuity of municipal administration.   I want to emphasize that it is this very continuity , where it is bad, which we must break. . Too many Councils contain men who do not mean to do anything if possible.     It is very dangerous to prevent the great volume of public opinion, whether extremist or otherwise, from having nroper expression and proper representation upon local bodies.Peeling upon the Housing question is acute.   The difficulties,before us are enormous; it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet entirely public expectations. It is essential that we should secure energetic local bodies who would assume a greater share of the responei-bility for housing which at present rests in too great a measure on the Central Authority.There is, I understand, difficulty in many cities in getting good municipal candidates - particularly women -to stand next November if only a third, of the seats are to be vacated as they fear a concentrated contest and conse-quently heavy expenBo with uncertain results.   If all 3eats were contested there would be greater chances of these persons getting in, and their election expenses would be reduced.I should add that in order to avoid the compulsory re-election in 1920 of one-third of the Councillors to be elected in 1919, which might deter many from standing, I propose that no municipal elections
should &quot;be held in 19 25, but that tho elections begin a?ain on the present system in 1921.   Thus, all those elected this year would bo secure for a minimum of two years.It is probable that many of the Borough Councils would object to the Bill I propose, but the arguments in favour 6f it are overwhelming.     Ho one can justify in face of a completely new electorate tho retention of Councillors in office without re-election for 7 years when the intention of Parliament has been retirement every 3 years.A certain amount of continuity will be guaranteed by the officials. It is also unbelievable^ that all the Councillors should lose their seats, and I have accepted an amendment to the Housing Pill in the House of Lords whereby co-option to tho statutory Housing Committees- of the Councils would be possible. This would enable good men who had lost their seats to be retained and would go far towards removing the Councils&apos; fears.A certain element cf continuity will also be provided by the Aldermen,   normally these hold office for six years, one-half retiring every third year.     Tne year of retirement varies in different boroughs, but the effect of the Emergency statutes is that the term of all aldermen who were hold in;; ofYlce in 1914 Trill have been extended to ten years, expiring at various da&apos;;p-s from thr s year onwards up to 3.9 24.    I propose that the new EMI should provide for the retirement this autumn of one-half of the aldermen of every borough, the other half to retire three years hence.     This appears to be a reasonable compromise
which vili secure new &quot;blood among, tha Aldermen without destroying the element of continuity which that body affords.    In uonu? cases one-half of the aldermen would in any event retire this year and the above plan puto all. borou^he on praoiBely the sane footing.I may observe that Lord Parmoorfo Bill enabling Local Authorities centrally to adopt a system of pro-portional roprmentation has been read a second time in the Lords.    This Bill, if it became law, might be of material assistance in securing the presence of desirable representatives on Borough council, and it is worth considering -bother it mi/ht not be advisable to give facilities for its passage through Parliament, So that its provisions may bo available for the municipal elections in the autumn to those Councils - ho may be willing to adopt it.C, ADDISON.Ministry of Health. 9.7.19.
