General Seely to Mr. Bonar Law &quot;&quot;a^eTT^h^Iy71ffi5T(Reference to War Cabinet 581 (l)).&quot;Air Ministry,Strand, W.C. 2.12th Jttly, 1919.Dear Bonar Law,I send you as promised at the meeting of the V/ar Cabinet en June 19th, the full summary of casualties for May with a comparison with the two preceding months and the last 6 months of last year.You will remember that at the same meeting I also referred to a figure of fatal casualties given in reply to a parliamentary question which I had assumed, in common with &amp;thera, referred to fatal flying casualties.   It had, in fact, included deaths from disease, although the term is seldom used in this sense,   tfnurehill was good enough tn correct this statement in my absence, and you may have thought that the argument, which I addressed to the Cabinet, as to the rapidly increasing risks of Xlying, especially as shown in the figures of the preceding month, and the consequent urgent need for the fixing of rates of adequate pay, in order to secure greater seal and efficiency, was overstated.    Unfortunately, the document I now send you, which I received last ni^ht, giving the full summary of the casualties, of which I then had only details, shows that the reverse is the oase.   The figures are indeed very serious and show the exceptional nature of the flying service and the consequences that flow from evan a slight slackening of effort.General Trenthard has issued a special order, as he was asked to do at the cabinet meeting, and every other possi-ble step will be taken to reduce flying risks.As you will be considering the report of the Committee appointed on June 19th, within the next day or two, I thou.$it it best to send you the full summary at once.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)

The trt+oi -ia %*i a-nd of these 21 caused fatalities.&apos;1 The figures andthe (orreapoMtog figures far March, april,itnd for the last six months of last year are:-March, April, May.6 months 1st July to Deo, 31st, 1918jTo&quot;Accidents, per 1005 hours.Killed.thours.Injured,per iwottbto, fpe7t0*5cj22	8,37	716	10,75	1337	SI.66	282.812,66 8,7 16,41,281931j hours,i,    7,23 0,1 18*151086It will be seen that tho casualties both actually and In slation to hours flown arc steadily increasing, and that in the latter jspoct the accidents have increased in May by eight times, and the talitios by thirteen times aompared with the average of the last six nths of 1918,By reference to, the sijo-monthly reports it will be seen that the flying hours decreased the casualty ratio increased, though not a way comparable to the above.     It would appear that Intermittent ying produces a marked effect on casualties, but even so the figures ven above are difficult to explain.
