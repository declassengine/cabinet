This property will yring the total area $f land acquired by the Board under the Small Holding Colonies Acts up to 17,791 acres.    In addition, a gift of 757 acres at Bosbury, Herefordshire, has been aooepted, making the tttal area *f tho  arm Settlements 18,548 aoree.An additional 5 ex-service men have started work at the Settlements during the week, bringing the total, number of men at the Settlements up to     164.A number tf applicants for the posts of Direetor and Assistant Eirecter of Settlements have been interviewed, and names have been provisionally selected, the effer of the definite appointments being deferred pending references being taken up and until a few further applicants have been interviewed.The reports received from the Directors show that at Patrlngton the weather has Veen very odd with high winds.

(i*) Work of. Agricultural IBxecutive Committees.Deteminatio n, of,..Tenanpies,    Application was made to the BoajrtThy the NJpri^ Executive Committee in Januarylast for the Determination of the Tenancy of 3 acres of land at Clenchwarton, occupied by Mr. H. A. Green, and a Determination Order was issued by the Board on the 11th February last.     Mr, Green exercised his right to appeal to Arbitration, but there has been some delay in the appointment of an Arbitrator.    The Committee now ask that the Determination Notice should be withdrawn, ae the cultivation of the land has improved.     The Board have acceded to the Committee^ request.The Board have issued an Order directing that the Montgomeryshire Agricultural ^Executive Committee shall consict of 13 members, ofwhom 5 shall be appointed by the Board.(iii)   Prevision, of Allotments.The tenant of a small field at Netherton, Dudley, whioh had been entered on by the Borough Council under the Cultivation of Lands Orders, applied for repossession of the land in order to cultivate it himself,     The proposal to relinquish possession on these grounds was much resented by the allotment-holders concerned. Eventually, however, one of the Board&apos;s Inspectors was able to arrange amicably with the tenant for the allotments to be continued for a period of two years after the termination of the war.(iv)   Tithet Commons,,rCopyhold and Survey.The Flints CC. in view of the Welsh Church Act, 1914, having doubts aa to the wisdom of the redemption of tithe rentoharge charged on lands acquired by them for Small Holdings, applied to the Welsh Church Commissioners for advice and were informed that the redemption at the present time did not appear in any way to be detrimental to the interests of the Council,Titheowners to whom requests are made by the Board in redemption oases for information as to the amount of tithe rent charge which they own and as to the rates and land tax payable thereon frequently forward such inquiries to their collectors to be answered.    Recently in several instances the collectors have demanded from the Board fees for the supply cf such information. It has accordingly been arranged that in future the Board shall not apply to the titheowners for information as to the rates and taxes but shall rely upon information on these natters which they obtain from the Assistant Overseer cf the Parish and the Cleric tc the Land Tax Commissioners for the District concerned.Redemption is particularly desirable in the interests of both titheowner and landowner where the lands are minutely subdivided and much expense and difficulty are as a result experienced in collecting the tithe rentcharge.    It is in such oases, however, that the collectors receive the highest commission for collection and moreover some are reluctant to advise their clients, the titheowners, to apply to the Board for compulsory redemption lest, when these small amounts have been cleared off, the titheowner may consider that, the collection having been simplified, he ean undertake it himself without the assistance of an agent.The Board     have received representations to the effect that the Tithe Act, 1918, should be amended so as to provide for the apportionment of redemption annuities imposed under the Act and for the redemption of such annuities if desired by the landowner before the term of the annuity has expired,    There is nc deubt that it would be desirable so to amend the Act when opportunity offers.
Commercial Dlvlqlgft,Equipment of Small Holdings.,Northumberland.    The Board have approved Mr. A. P. Kerr, County Land Agent being in charge of equipmont with Mr.. Young as Architectural Assistant, the latter at a salary of  250 per annum.    The Superintond-^ng Architect has visited tho Hexhamshiro Estate.Sussex.    A meeting with the West Sussex Small Holdings Committee has been attended to considor Equipment,Darby.    At a conference with the Chairman of tho&apos;Small Holdings Committee it was proposed to wmpley local Architects on equipment, on aocount of the scattered nature of the work, which is moreover not enough for a wholo-time officer.    This has been approved.Warwick.    The Superintending Architect attended the Small Holdings Committee to assist in the selection of an Architect and the appointment was made forthwith. &apos;Shipping for Phosphate Rock.The contracts made by the Ministry of Munitions for the importation of Phosphate Rock into this country have been assigned to the Fertiliser Manufacturers&apos; Association,, and tho Ministry relieved of its obligation under contracts,     In one case, however, the Agents of the sellers of Phosphate Rock,in North.Africa refused to agree to the assignment of a contract for 45,000 ions unless a guarantee was give;.: that shipping would be provided .tV.    ft this quantity during the present.year.     If the guarantee asked for was not forthcoming it appeared certain that the contract would be.cance lied, and the Rock sold at higher prices to 3Tar.ce or Ita^y-  : &quot;ho Board, in eonjunction with the Ministry cf Munitions, have secured the concurrence cf the Shipping Controller to the necessary guarantee being given.    In connection with these negotiations the Fertiliser Manufacturers1 Association drew the attention of the Eoard to the &quot;difficulty, experienced in chartering steamers for the transport of Phosphate Rock from North America.     The Ministry of Shipping consider, however, that there is no reason why the Phosphate trade should not be able to secure the shipping space required without official intervention.Lime,    The Lime Firms Ltd., Llandebis, South Wales, which has hitherto been engaged in the sale of lump lime, are proposing to take up the sale of ground lime.     The Board are informed that the firm&apos;s &apos; current prices of Ground Lime are 36/- per ton f.o*r. in vendor&apos;e bags, bags free, or 24/6d. per ten f.e.r. in customer&apos;s bags.    These quotations compare very favourably indeed with any existing quotations for ground lime, and the Board are drav/ing the attention of the Agricultural Executive Committees to -the existence of this source of supply, and at the same time arc arranging that the Approved Fertiliser Agents of the Board shall be informed that the Lime Firms Ltd., are now in a position to produce Ground Lime on a large scale if the demand    I requires it.Transport of Fruit and Vegetables.A leaflet was recently prepared giving Borne advice to fruit growers and salesmen with a view to p^reventing congestion at the markets and facilitating traffic.    This Leaflet in the first instanqe was drawn up on the advice of representatives of the Railway Companies, but when submitted to the Horticultural Distribution Committee and to ^pthe principal Trade Association, great exception was taken to some of the suggested recommendations.     Several meetings for the discussion of the matter have been -htfTd/&apos; and finally-.a. joint meeting was held at which both the Railway Companies and the Growers- and Salesmen were represented, and the terms uT tb*i X-oaflet h*ve now been finally agreed with a view to its immediate issue and circulation,
5d Bill.The draft Seed Bill has no?/ beon considered by a Sub-Committee of the trade members of the Seeds Advisory Committee *    They recommend that the proposed grading system for cereals, graosos and olovors should bo abandoned as impracticable and that tho system of Standards for cereals and a full declaration of germination and purity in the case of grasses and clovers, as under the Testing of Seeds Order, should be maintained.     Other amendments suggested by tho Trade Committee arc unimportant *Technical-and, ^Cultiyation Division. Il^-.25t,ion JBranch.Proposals have been received from the Kent Agricultural Education Sub-Committee regarding the acquisition of Borden School and Grove 2nd Parm, both near Sittingbourne, for the purpose of a Farm Institute.    The farm will be sold immediately and the school buildings can only be utilised when provision is made for tho accommodation of the pupils on a site which is to bo acquired near Sittingbourne Station. The school building and the farm appear to be suitable for the purpose which the Committee have in viovr, and it is understood that the Board of Education will rat93 no objection to the sale of the present school by the Governors provided that arrangements are mado for tho erection of a new building.Seed Testing Station.A Seed Testing Exhibit has been arranged at the British Scientific Products Exhibition which is being held at the Central Hall, Vfc-stminster, from July 3rd to August 5th.    Various methods of germination,, growing specimens of injurious weeds and diagrams illustrating the work of the Station are being shown.Tractor Section *During the week ended the 20th June, 1,353 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 873 of these vera being operated under the new Tractor Scheme,     Of tho 430 operated by Committees directly 205 or 43$. were in commission and ware idle only 6% of the time on account of bad weather.     27o tractors were idle the whole week awaiting either repairs or contracts.

The Board&apos;s present scheme for the training of &quot;Officers and men of suitable promise&quot; deals only with applicants who are likely at the end of their training to fill successfully places in ordinary agricultural life.   Officers who are so disabled as not to fall within this category are. entitled to training under the Ministry of Pensions Royal Warrant. The responsibility for training such Officers - apart frem those requiring curative training - has been transferred from the Ministry of Pensions to the Ministry of Labour, who have asked the Beard to undertake the responsibility.   (The Board have already accepted this as regards men - as distinct from Officers).The training of disabled Officers in agriculture including the complicated system of payment of grants under the Royal Warrant will throw additional work: on the Training Branch, which is at present much understaffed for its present duties.
2*   Training .,of Men-&quot;Disabled&quot; JMien.     Inspections have been completed of all the Ministry oFPen^ions centres taken over by the Board.     It is found that certain of those centres are totally unsuitable for training, and that others will require to be improved and expanded.     A number of new centres will be necessary.The -Training Centre at the Royal Gardens, Windsor, is being enlarged for the training of 25 additional men, by the provision of hut accommodation.     Huts at present being used in Windsor Forest by the Canadian Forestry Corps will be utilised. The Corps have offered to erect the necessary huts on a site close to the Royal Gardens already prepared by the Office of Woods.     This offer ha3 been accepted, an Officer of the Commercial Division has inspected the huts, and arrangements are being made fcr their erection on the Royal Gardens site forthwith.&quot;Fit&quot; len.     It has been decided that Training Centres for fit men should not be used for the training of disabled men also. Agricultural Executive Committees are being pressed to complete their arrangements for Training Centres.     The Gloucestershire Agricultural Executive Committee are providing a centre, previously used by them under the Cultivation (Horse and Tractor) Scheme, at Quedgeley Farm, near Gloucester, and are arranging, with the Board&apos;3 approval, to transfer to it horses used under that Scheme.     This Centre will accommodate 50 ex-Service men.Men in Training at Centres.

At a meeting of the Horticultural Sub-Committee on June 2Vth it was stated that no new Committee had been formed, but that it was hoped that the County Council would shortly approve of a Horticultural Instructor being appointed as well as a Horticultural ;^ub-Committee.Huntingdon. The Board are informed that a new Horticultural -jubrCommittee has been formed.The Royal Show, Cardiff.,   A noteworthy feature of the Show v;as the large demand for the board&apos;s leaflets and pamphlets especially those dealing with cropping and stocking small holdings Hany enquiries were received relating to insect pests, spraying materials and manures.Cul tl vat ion.i Much of the time of the Inspectors has a$ain been*  occupied during the wee.s in obtaining estimates oirthe forthcoming plum and $amson crop.
An Inspection has been made at Park Farm,   Truro, offered as a training    centre.     It is reported that the farm is in a bad condition, and would need to be thoroughly renovated before it; is of any use for this purpose.Fruit Preservation.The Eoard&apos;s exhibit at the Royal Show. Cardiff, created widespread interest.     Two of the Board&apos;s demonstrators were in attendance, and four and sometimes five demonstrations were given daily.Bee Keeping.A further 65 Italian Queens have been received at the Restocking Apiaries from Italy.Representations have been made to the Department by various Horticultural Sub-Committees to the effect that the present cold damp weather is adversely affecting the rearing of nucleus stocks, and urging that an additional allocation of sugar may be made   for this purpose.     The Sugar commission has accordingly been approached, and. it isi hoped that additional sugar for this purpose will be released.Small live-stock Section.Rabbits,&quot; Judging from the enquiries received there appear to be a^large number of tame Rabbits for disposal at the present time.Poultry.     A number of enquiries by letter and personal calls have been dealt with.Plant Disease Section.Wart;Dise,asec     Outbreaks of this disease have been reported to the BoardTfrom Carnarvon, Denbigh and Cumberland.     Ho further cases of Wart Disease have been seen in Cornwall and Wales in the early varieties the bulk of which have now been raised.Potato Blight.     In spite of the drought satisfactory crops of &quot;iarlies have been raised in Cornwall.     In view of the national importance of the potato -crop, a press notice has been prepared calling the attention of growers to the necessity for spraying their oxops.     The estimated reduction in the.area of potatoes planted this year as compared with the area planted in 1918 is, approximately, 15$.^^ &apos;3IL522?^^I1L.M.M^I*     There appear to be comparatively .. few instances where this disease has made its appearance.     The County Councils of two important fruit-growing Counties are reported as being in favour of more stringent measures far its prevention and control.I^ori5^^ojeb^rie8. Up to the present sixty-six licences have been issued, allowing importation of 2900 tons of berries from Holland, and 135 tans from Belgium.^ Q*l.of JTursery Stock.     A notice, dealing with the question : of the prohibition of importation of plants into the United States has been issued to the press, acquainting exporters with the conditions&apos;necessary to secure entry into that country.
Labour Division. ...........&quot;&quot;&quot;...... &quot;........iDemobilisation.,   Tho number of 8^Ttoruli7irjris?ts demobilised during IfBe seven days ended 2nd July was 1,820 maJrlng the total number of such men released up to that date 236,505.Soldier Labour. The number of soldiers remaining in or attacEid&quot;tV Agricultural&apos;Companies at the end of the week ending 5th July was 9,048.Women*s Branch.The demand for women workers is still in excess of the supply, and a request for the 1-and Army for flax pulling has had to be refused on account of the fact that women will not be available at the time when they will be required for the work.It had been arranged that a large number of women should go to Huntingdon for the flax harvest there, but the weather has prevented the flax being -sufficiently ripened, and orders for the women were therefore cancelled the day they were to go down,A meeting of all Organising Secretaries in England and Wales was held in London during the v/ees.   The new organisation, by which the Women1s Committees are to become Sub-Committees of the Agricultural Executive Committees, was explained and discussed.   Many points of interest were raised,&quot;and an attempt was made to ascertain the opinion of the Organising secretaries as to the general feeling in the Counties with regard to the continuing&apos; of the Land Army after the harvest.   The view was expressed that the criticism against the continuance of this subsidised form of labour came largely from those who did not understand either the urgency of the food question or tho difficulty of obtaining satisfactory labour.   One Organising Secretary stated that in her County the opinion had been expressed that the expenditure on the Women13 Land Army had been less in proportion than that on German prisoners or other form of subsidised labour.The general feeling was that when the Land Army is demobilised, a large number of women will return to their former occupation, and that several thousand milker3 - the, most necessary of all forms of labour - would be lost to tho country    $lie reason for this would be the loss of various privileges and safeguards at present available for members of the Land Army, such as free uniform, maintenance during unemployment for a certain length of time during the year, and free railway fares when tailing up fresh employment.The idea of an Association of Land Workers to take the place of the   Land Army was discussed at some length.   It was proposed, if such an Association comes into being, that it should have a Government grant to enable it to buy clothes in bulk to sell at oost price to members of the Association, to set up ho-3tels, etc., and to -rive &quot;che women such safeguards as-would be possible.   The aim of such an Association would also be to raise the status of the farm servant, and to guarantee the conditions of that servicer   Until training and guarantees are available for this particular work, there is very little to recommend it to any woman. &apos;tThe opinion of the meeting might be said to be that should it be considered advisable to demobilise the Land Army,
it will be essential to have an Association with a certain amount of Government backing, as unless some inducement can be held out to women to remain as agricultural workers, the labour situation is likely to be serious.Two members of the land Array in the Holland Division of Lincoln, who have been working as motor tractor drivers, have taken the first and third prizes   of  20 and  10 respectively, offered by a firn, by whom they are now employed, for the highest acreage worked with the minimum amount of fuel, the general condition of the tractor at the end of the period being also taken into consideration.   The second and fourth prizes were won by men with whom the women were competing.Women1s Institutes.   Ten new Institutes were started last week, making a total of 1,13 7.

Profortes Murayana came from the hones Department of Tokyo,    He wished to investigate methods cf Fishing in this country.    Later on Mr. Eeuso Adachi, e- member of the
House of Representatives, Japan, came from the Japanese Legation to acquire some general information regarding the methods employed in this country for caching and disposing of herrings.     Some general information was afforded him and we proposed to refer him to some general literature on the subject.Fishery Education.-    The Board have recently come to the conclusion that a comprehensive&quot;scheme for training partially disabled soldiers and sailors is impracticable, and they are preparing an announcement in the Press on the subject.    In the meantime it has been necessary, therefore, to inform Mr. jarvis of Pevensey Bay that his scheme for training certain demobilised officers cannot be financed by the Board, although they are prepared to render assistance in other ways.Research Vessel.    The Development Commissioners have informed us that thfly have received a Preliminary Report from the Committee on Fishery. research who are advising them as regards the future conduct of scientific work.      This Preliminary Report contains a recommendation that the Board should at once be provided with an adequate soa-going research vessel, and, acting on that recommendation, the Development Commissioners have asked us to quote what the provision of such a vessel and the neoessary fitting will cost.General Division.Flax Production Branch.A very marked improvement iB noticeable in the flax crop, more especially in Yorkshire, Horthants and Lincolnshire.    Crops that were not already in bloom when the drought came to an end have grown considerably and in several districts the straw is up to the average height.    Seeds which had not germinated at all until the rain came a fortnight age have now begun to grow vigorously, but too late to be of any value.Harvest operations have commenced in Somerset and Dorset where the crop will be a light one.The Irish Graders, accompanied by the Administrator of the Flax Supplies Committee, visited Yeovil and Selby last weeki    About 22 tons of flax fibre was graded and the reports of graders were encouraging.The want of adequate tank accommodation for retting has, of course, boon prejudicial to the quality of the flax produced, but such tank retted flax that could bo produced made good prices, and most of the dew-rettod flax came up to the average of that quality.The increased cost of labour, however, makes dew-retting a very expensive operation, and although it &quot;was abso3.utely necessary this year if any flax was to be produced at all, owing to the absonce of tanks at the factories, it is hoped that in future most of the crop will be tank retted.The Managers and Technical -Experts were all present at the grading and a very great deal of useful information was gained.A small quantity of flax scutched in the new factory at Peterborough was put before the Graders and made 35/- per stone. Taking into consideration that this fibre was only scutched last month in very hot weather and by very inexperienced hands, this first effort of Peterborough is distinctly encouraging.The   -whole of the flax graded at Yeovil was disposed of to local spinners by the Flax Supplies Committee after purchase from the Branch.
Kelham Estate *As much rain has fallen throughout the country recently, it i8 irell to report tho situation at Newark.    Rain has fallen to the N.W., U and S. of Kelham but not on the estate, so that the drought still continues there.    In addition, it has been bitterly cold, and gales of nnd have been incessant.Spring oats are bad, but fortunately there is but a email acreage.    The barley crop is moderate:   the blue peas have finished growing.    Hay will be only a fair crop in spite of the earlier excellent promise, and the pastures are beginning to bain.     The large acreage of wheat, however, with one or two exceptions, is locking well, fho boans have podded weJj . although the crop will be short.    The printer oat a are moderate and will eo$n be fit to cut.    The root crops, are in excellent condition..In view of the condition of the land, much labour and cultivations are being spent on the fallow crops.Soonomic3 Jpivisjon. atistical Branch,The monthly rport on the condition of crops on 1st July shows prospects of one of the poorest harvests for very many years.    Hops ire average, or a little better, but all other crops will, upon present appearances, be seriously deficient.     The following are the estimated deficiencies:   wheat 9%)   barley 16$;   oats 20$;   beans &apos;. -7$;   peas 10%;   potatoes 10%;   mangolds 20%;   seeds1&apos; hay 20$;   and meadow liaj 12%,     Turnips are very unpromising, and pastures very bare;   while fruit has not borne out the promise of a month ago, and only apples, bears, and gooseberries appear to be about average,ge.    Rain, if it pomes, would of course improve the roots and second crops of hay.The appointment of Inspectors to verity the acreages blaimed to be under corn has been in full swing during the week. j919 (out of 1,066) have now.been offered, and actual appointments to ate number 72?.     The work of filling the gaps where insufficientfumbers have been recommended by the County Agricultural Committees, or here nominees have declined the posts, is being dealt with by the nspectors.The agricultural returns are now being received from the Reporters in quantities that are normal for July, although the total to date (ISO.000) is rather less than at the same date lust year. The staff engaged in tabulating them is now at maximum strength.c i cu 11 ural^ jyag e s^JBo ard.A meeting of the Conference Comxrittoe was held on 2nd Rnst., and meetings of the &quot;Administration&apos;&apos;&apos;,. ,!Allowances&quot;, &quot;Customary fours&quot;, and &apos;&apos;Soloction&quot; Committees on the 3rd inst.The thirty-fifth meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board was held on the 4th inst.After considering ;a report from the Drafting Committee with v^ ^gard to the proposals to fix special harvest ratej together with the Ejections lodged to their proposals of the  th July to fix such special rates for the corn harvest in certain areas, and the reports on the Proposals made by the District Wages Commit toes concerned, the
Wages Board decided to issue Orders fixing special harvest rates for the following areas:-   Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Derby, Devonshire, Dorset, Gloucester, Hereford, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxford-shire, Somerset, Suffolk, Surrey, Wiltshire,     &apos;Yorkshire, Anglesey and Carnarvon, Denbigh and Flint.    Although une Proposal ^or Cambridge-shire applied also to Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire, which form part of the area of the same District Wages Committee, tho Board, in view of the objections received from these counties, decided not to fix any special corn harvest rates for Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire and consequently in these counties as in all the other areas in England and Wales not specified above, the question of any extra payment for the corn harvest will be a matter fur mutual agreement between employer and worker.Sir Ijenry Row presented a report from the 11 Administration&quot; Committee dealing with Permits of Exemption, question with regard to the scope of the mxmmvm rates and legal proceedings taken for the enforcement of the rates.. -The question having been raised as to whether in the event of workers employed in agriculture who were also small holders, wishing to work only a proportion of the week in order to have time to work on their own &quot;holdings, the Board decided that it was permissible for such workers to be paid a proportion of the weekly wage equivalent to the proportion of the week during which they were employed *Mr. Robbins presented a report from the &quot;Customary Hours&quot; Committee.    The Board adopted the report and decided to give Kotice of Proposal to vary the special minimum rates for stockmen of all classes which were based on a week of ,: customary hours11 so as to provide In the case of Anglesey and Carnarvon, Berkshire,&quot; Derbyshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Lincolnshire: No r thuml; e r J and and Durham, (except in the case of whole-time shepherds) and Yorkshire that these cKaseeu of workers chould be paid at the ordinary and overtime rates;   in the case of Cambridgeshire. Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire, Cumberland and Westmorland, and the Furneee District of Lancashire, Denbigh and Flint, Gloucestershire. Merioneth, and Montgomery, end Warwickshire, that they should be paid at a higher weekly sdn:&apos;mum rate calculated on the ordinary and overtime rates so as to provide that the workers are paid the equivalent of the ordinary and overt.!tie rates for a fi/ed number of hours which is higher than the number of 2*oure on which the weekly minimum rates for ordinary labourers is based;   and in the case of Norfolk and Suffolk at the ordinary rates with an additional inclusive weekly sum tc cover time spent by workers of these special classes in connection with the feeding, cleaning, etc., of stock. Before an Order giving effect to the Proposal can be made a month njyh slopes, from the date on which the Notice of Proposal is pobl.ish.c-d.     It was also decided on the report of this Committee to cancel the special minimum rates for male workers under 18 years of age in Brecon and Radnor who were wholly or partially boarded and lodged by their employers and whose duties include attending to horses and ether stock, and to provide for the payment of boys of fcheca same classes in Merioneth and Montgomery on the basis of the same number of hours as the number on which c$e minimum rates for special classes of malti workers of 18 years of age and over were based, namely 61 in summer and 58 in winter.In coneoquence of tho abolition of customary hours as a basis for tho fixing of special rates for special cle-eses of workers, U was agreed that a Kotica of Proposal should be issued to cancel the provisions of the Board!&amp; Orders which provide that time spent on the &quot;short day&quot; in connection with the feeding and ;-cleaning of stock should not rank as overtime employment in all areas except Norfolk and Suffolk.On a report presented by Sir Henry Rew from tho Committee on 1Allowances&quot; with regard to recommendations from District Wages
Committees on the subject of certain revisions in the values allowed for board and lodging in part payment of minimum rates of wages, the Board decided that immediate effect be given to the decision at their previous meeting to increase the value for full board and lodging for female workers of 17 years of age and over in all areas in which it is at present Iobs than 13/- a v&apos;eek, to that amount, in proportion-ate increases in the other items of board and lodging for such workers and in all such items for female workers below 17 years of age.    The Board also adopted the Allowances Committee&apos;s recommendations that the Determinations of the Northumberland and &quot;Durham, Staffordshire, Surrey, Glamorgan and J/ionmouth and Pembroke, Carmarthen and Cardigan District Wages Committees, for oertain increases in the values of Board and Lodging for male workers, should be approved.The Board also considered the objections received to their Proposal of the 3rd June to increase the ordinary minimum and over-time rates of wages for female workers of 18 years of age and over, together with the reports from the District Wages Committees on the Proposal, and decided to make an Order (to come into force on the 14th July) to increase the rates in accordance with the Proposal, the effect of which is that the minimum rates for female workers of 18 years of age and over in all areas in England and Wales except Yorkshire and Cumberland and Westmorland, will in future be 6d per hour, with overtime rates of 7fd an hour for week-days and 9d for Sundays;   in Yorkshire and Cumberland and Westmorland the minimum rate will be 7d per hour, with overtime at Qd an hour on week-days, and 10?Vd an hour on Sunday.    It was also decided on the recommenda-tion of the Northumberland and Durham District Wages Committee not to confirm those parts of the Proposal which related to whole-time workers in ;Torthumberland and consequently this class of female workers is no^ entitled to be paid at the hourly rate applicable to other feraale workers in the area.The Board considered a draft Notice of Proposal to reduce the number of hours on which tho minimum rates for male workers under-18 are based in Anglesey and Carnarvon, Cheshire, Glamorgan and Monmouth, Herefordshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Yorkshire.     It was agreed that the issue of lotice of [Proposal should be- postponed in the case of Cheshire until the whole question of tho minimum rates in Cheshire should come up and that tfotice of Proposal should be issued in due course in the case of the other areas mentioned above.The Board considered a draft Notice cf Proposal which had previously been sent to the District Wages Committees concerned to vary the &quot;half-holiday&quot; provisions of the Eoard&apos;s Orders in the areas of the six Welsh District Wages Committees and in Northumberland and Durham and Yorkshire, so as to provide that in cases where a workman by agreement with his employer is entitled in each half year either to a week1 s holiday on full pay or a nfeek&apos;s work on double pay time worked in excess of 6-J hours on one day in each week should no longer rank as overtime employment.    It was agreed that Notices of Proposals should bo issued in tho case of Anglesey and Carnarvon, Brecon and Radnor, Denbigh and .v1int, and iierioneth and Montgomery and that no action should bQ taken with regard to Pembroke, Car-marthen and Cardigan, in which case the &quot;District Wages Committee had reported that they did not desire such a variation in their area, and that consideration of the matter as regards Horthumberland and Durham and Yorkshire should be deferred until the next meeting of the Wages Board.During the vcek 178 case3 cf complaint of non-payment cf the minimum rates were received, the largest number from a single oounty being 19 in thn case of Somerset.     One hundred and sixty-three cases wer* sent to Inspectors for visit;   enquiries by correspondence were made in 370 cases and 77 cases were completed .
