The offers number 196 and cover about      36,000 acres.Farm,settlements administered by the,Board,     The, area of land acquired by the&quot;Board under the Small Holdings&quot;Colonies Act, 1916 and 1918, remains the same as last week, namely, 16,003 aores.An additional 13 ex-Service men have commenced work at the Settlements during the week, bringing the total number of such men at the Settlements up to 179.    Thjs number is made up of 58 settlers, 97 probationers and 24 other ex-Service men working as wage-earners.     In addition 15 men have been accepted as probationers, but have not yet started work.Difficulties are being experienced in accepting any more married men for any of the existing Fa.rm Settlements, as the cottage accommodation available has all been r-aken up.     The provision of additional cottages is therefore a very urgent matter.     Single men are still being accepted, and accommodated in Army Huts erected foo the purpose  se.
The weekly reports received from the Directors show that although a little rain has fallen at each of the Settlements more is badly needed.     The root crops at Patrjngton will be a failure unless there is ccneidoratje rajn shortly,     At Holieston rain has ^hindered the hay-making, but was insufficient to&quot;do any real good to the crops which had Buffered from the prolonged drought.Arrangements h&amp;&quot;&apos;;-s been made for two huts to be erected at pembrey by the Office cf Works.     These are urgently required as ex-Service men are available for work at the Settlement as soon as accommodation has been provided.Some of the settlers at Hplbeach are lifting their early potatoes.     Great wastage is being e^ptiienced amongst the potatoes of last year&apos;s crop now being riddled,        proving unfit for sale, wheat is threshing out very light and much below expectations.The Director of the Eosbury Settlement takes up his duties during the present week.Three prises were scoured by six Exmoor rams sent from the Amesbury Farm Settlarent to the Royal Shew at Cardiff.(ii ) Jki% cf .Jvvicul tural^Execvtiye Committees .pejtermin8tion^fwiTenajjciei;.     r;\he OJ^pucegterBMre A.ErC. have been endeavouring, to&quot;c-iV*ci. ^ change&apos; In the tenancy of a farm at Stroud which was in e foul, state, and very badlj manrged t     The owner was inclined to sympathise Khhhjs truant f arid believed that he ma capable of improving the tarn, and in deference to his wishes the Committee did not deter mi re the tenancy but serv-sd a Cultivation Fc tice on the tenant.     A -further inspection early this year revealed that the f armme going fx oir tad to worse, and the Committee therefore applied for authority tc de ieimj ns the tenancy , which was duly given.     The Board arf. new inl 02i:&amp;c that the matter, has been settled by the tenant 3%r**iw, to gi^s up posset si on on the 24th June, and to *pake no claim for disturbance or removalc     The incoming tenant is approved by the 0ommitte3 and accepted by the landlord.In March, 1917. tha Sent A..I..C.   took possession of Crundale House Pa,?-a v.hic.V was to a very bad state of cultivation. The tenant was allowed to -        remain in occupation and to act as ploughman and fo^man under the dixection of a member of the Committee, who ^as respond ble for. the management.     The Committee now wish to hand hact t,:?s farm to the owners, but as the former tenant is not aud.ee nvoics 07 the landlord to quit, the effect of handing back tho ^ arm would be tore store him in occupation.     As the tenant is incapable of farming the land himself, the Board hava issued a Notice determining his tenancy forthwith.G
The Board were requested by the Middlesex A. E. C. in April last to determine the te? of Mr. Tetty ? Farm, Mill Hill, who occupied a diary farm of 208 ? which was reported to be in a very bad condition. The Committee stated that the buildings were excellent and suitable for 50-60 cows, but that there were only 5 cows then on the farm and these did not belong to the farmer.

As Mr. Tetty protested against being turned out of the farm, the Board instructed their Sub-Commissioner to make an independent inspection. He reported that the farm was fairly well stocked with cattle, and, while the ditches and hedges were admittedly in a very bad state, the farmer could scarcely be held responsible as he had only been in possession since Michaelmas, 1918. The Board, therefore, declined to determine the tenancy.

The A. E. C. considered the matter at their meeting on the 30th May and resolved to ask the Board again to determine the tenancy. The Board&apos;s Sub-Commissioner then paid a "surprise" visit to the farm, and ascertained that Mr. Tetty had misled him at his previous visit by importing extra stock. The Board have, therefore, now issued the order determining Mr. Tetty&apos;s tenancy.

Prosecution. An occupier at Ludworth, Derbyshire, has been fined  £10 and  £1 costs for failure to comply with a Cultivation Notice. The defence was that arrangements had been made with someone else to cultivate the farm, but the Bench ruled that the occupier could not evade his obligations in this manner.

(iii) Land Drainage.

Berkshire. The Berkshire A. E. C. have in the last 12 months carried out very-substantial improvements in the drainage of an area of about 2,000 acres between Cholsey Station on the G.W.R and Wallingford which has been seriously waterlogged by the choking of the Cholsey Brook and its complicated system of feeder drains.   The main brook has been regraded and resectioned down to its outfall into the Thames, and practically the whole of the subsidiary channels have been similarly treated, the work being now almost completed with the exception of a few small drains.

This work has entailed the removal of old culverts and the insertion of ferro-concrete pipes under cartways in substitution for the inadequate or ruined culverts; it has been greatly helped by the generosity of Mr. C. Venables, the owner of Mill Court at the outfall of the brook, who has offered every facility for the execution of works where the brook runs through his private grounds and for the removal of certain obstructions by which the brook was dammed for the adornment of the grounds.

As a result of the work, the water levels in the channels have been reduced at eight selected points where this matter has been tested, by from 1-3¾ feet, and a practical and unified system of drainage has been instituted throughout the area. In all, about 35 miles of channels have been cleansed.

The work has been carried out by prisoners of war, whose labour has been supplied free of charge. The overhead charges amount to about £800; it is hoped to recover the greater part under the provisions of awards, the powers of which the Executive Committee have been exercising under Regulation 2M, and where these awards are not applicable, in pursuance of notice? issued by the Executive Committee under that Regulation.

This represents a considerable advance as compared with previous years, the numbers for the corresponding periods in the past six years being 94 in 1913, 88 in 1914, 4a,in 1915, 47 in 1916, 38 in 1H7, and 86 in 1918.During the past week several applications have been received for the Board!s consent to the inolosure of common lands, in some cases for the purpose of the erection of War Memorials and in other cases for the erection of houses under the Housing, etc., Acts. These applications are under consideration.Commercial Division.Small Holdings: tollmen tiCambridge. A visit nas been paid to Cambridge to confer with the County Land Agent,    The Small Holdings Committee propose that the Architectural work shall be carried Out by the County Land Agent with the assistance of a geod Architectural Assistant, and it is believed that this arrangement will work satisfied&amp;rterlly with advice from the Board&apos;s Superintending Architect.Somerset.   The post of architect was advertised and the selected candidate approved by the Board,    The officer appointed has however resigned, and in view of the urgency of equipping land available at Michaelmas^ the Board are lending the services of one of their District Architects to the Counoil,    At a meeting at Taunton this week attended by the Board&quot;s Officers, the Small Holdings Committee decided on the establishment of a Works Department as the Committee are sure that satisfactory tenders cannot be obtained from local builders.   The Board will lend one of its Surveyors for a few months to establish the Department on a satisfactory basis.    The Building Materials Supply department show a most helpful attitude and have undertaken that every assistance will be given to this venture.     It is also the view of the principal architect to the Local Government Board that more and more recourse will need to be made to direct administration in view of the disorganisation of the building trade.
East Riding.    An inspection of some of the pre*war oottagea and equipments was made on the 18th &quot;by the superintending architect and sketch plans for the proposed adaptation and improvement of 3 oottages on the Babthorpe Estate were provisionally passed to enable the County Land Agent to proceed with working drawings and to obtain tenders.    Plans for further equipment of this Estate will be forwarded for the Board&apos;e approval very shortly.^ The Materials Supply Department has been notified of theforthcoming work and requested to assist with the supply of the necessary material? from local :&apos; . sources.fertilisers Deliveries in 1918*19.Returno of the deliveries *f su^erph^erphate and compound fertilisers during May 1919 are now available.    During the month 60,200 tons of supeinrphorsphate and--nearly 92,000 tons of compound fertilisers were sent out from the works j as compared with 45,200, tons and 70J500 tons respectively in May, 1918.    The stocks of phosphate&quot;rock and of all artificial fertilisers dropped considerably during the month.It is now possible to present &quot;   -together summary figures of deliveries for eaclt of the principal fertilisers for thej.2 months to 31st May, 1019, with, comparisons for the previous season, as follows: -1918-19. 1917-U.

With turnips the shrinkage during the winter has not been so severe and the crops are looking up to the average.     in Kont tho swede arop has been almost destroyed in parts by a severe attack of the Turnip Plea Beetle during tho past few weeks.    In Lincolnshire, sWdes are looking rather better than in Kent, but the dry weather nae tried them seirerely.f7.
Technical and Cultivation Division. Technical Section,^a summary hae been submitted of reports received during Joay from Honorary Correspondents of the Plant Diseases Sub-committee of the Technical Committee.     As regards Cereals,, with the exception of wirewcrm attacks (which have been general) few complaints of damage have been received.    In several cases, wheat grown on land which was ploughed out of grass in 1917 has suffered severely from wireworms. and in one case in &quot;Yorkshire 70 acres of autumn sown wheat were destroyed .     Oats have also suffered severely in Lancashire and North -ales.     Tho conspicuous absence of rooks in the neighbourhood where these attacks have taken place in the .tfcrth is reported.    In view of the lateness of sowing oats this spring, serious attacks by frit fly were anticipated .     At a ncted frit locality in Hampshire, however, the flies wero.net found at any time during Liay in large numbers and only oats sown fcr experimental purposes early in Uay were seriously attacked.    In Shropshire, flies were, however, abundant by way 15th and the attack was more general.     Attacks were also recorded from Lincolnshire and Hcrth Wales.     As regards potatoes, wircworms   are noted as causing much damage on light soils in Sussex, some seed tubers containing 10-12 larvae.    Skin Spot is again reported from several parts of the country, associated in many cases with damaged buds.     ffiea Beetles have been abundant and destructive to turnips,j,n^^man^els in most districts owing&quot; to the drought.     Pasture&quot;field.s&quot;&quot;Tn&quot;&quot;tho &quot;Bell Busk district of Leed3 which were badly attacked last year by Charaeas Oraminis (Antler Moth) were examined on i-iay 24th, but caterpillars were found to be entirely absent.     A field of about 12 acres in Kent was badly damaged by ants, being in  daces quite bare.     As regards Fruit, attacks by the Winter Moth on apples have been severe in the North, Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire.     Lackey Moths are recorded as exceptionally evident in leicestershire, Berkshire, some parts of Cambridgeshire, Sussex and Kent.Seed Testing Station.The number of samples sent for test is now dropping quickly     I but the Station is fully employed on arrears of -&quot;control11 samples. A seed testing exhibit was prepared for the Board of Agriculture Pavilion at the ?oyal Agricultural society of Ingland&apos;s Show, Cardiff. A notable feature was a map showing the number of farmers in each country who had sent samples for test during the present season. Certain counties were very prominent in this respect, notably Anglesey, Stafford, Devon, Montgomery and Cornwall.     The number of farmers in each county who have availed themselves of seed testing facilities appears to depend upon the energy of the Gounty        ; Organiser in making these facilities known.    The work in Anglesey is worthy of great praise in this respect, and if similar methods were adopted in each county, larger numbers of farmers&apos; samples would be received.Briefly, the method is as follows:-   Samples are sent by the farmers to the County Organiser who transmits them to the Station. Reports are sent to the Organiser who hands them on to the farmers and collects the fees - a monthly aocount being rendered to him by the Station.    Though this entails a slight delay and makes more work for the County Organiser it enables him to be in a position to offer advice to the farmer in the case of samples of poor germination. Moreover it reduces the clerical work at the Station very considerably .?ractor   ection.During the week ended the 15th June, 1372 tractors were in the hands of Committees and 867 of these were being operated under
! the new Tractor Scheme,j Of the 506 tractors operated &quot;by Committees directly, 211,I er.42$, wore in commission and were idle only 3$ of the time onI account of bad weather.    297 tractors were idle either through lackI of work oi* awaiting repairs.3n England and Wales,. 2165 acres were ploughed end 9316, &apos;,  cultivated by 501 tractors, giving an average of 4.36 acres and 10.61 )&apos; acres respectively.The highest average acreage was dealt with in Anglesey where 28 tsactovs ploughed 69 acres and cultivated 1215 average 2\ and 43i Raves vespectively.mlremflnts and,Disposals^ Section.During the week ended June 28th, returns of sales have been forwarded by West Hiding (Yorks), Dorset, Worcester, Essex, Glamorgan Hrntsr Devon, Hunts, Horthants, Flint, Cheshire,-lanos.
