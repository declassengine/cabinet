[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]CONFIDENTIAL. [June 26, 1919.]Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.Italy/Oil.MEMORANDUMONITALIAN AFFAIRS, MARCH-JUNE 1919.THE following memorandum is intended to give a review of Italian affairs in relation to both, domestic and foreign politics, from the beginning of March to the end of June 1919:-1. The trend of public opinion and events in Italy during the past four months has naturally been influenced very considerably by the negotiations in Paris and the various discussions arising out of them. This applies to domestic as well as to foreign politics ; the relations between the two, in fact, have in the case of Italy been closer than in any other country.2. The Italian Government, with the visit of President Wilson to Rome, if not indeed long before, must have realised that there was little likelihood of Italy&apos;s obtaining satisfaction for all her territorial claims. It might have been expected that Italian public opinion would have been prepared for a realisation of this fact. No steps, however, were taken to pave the way to a disappointment. The contrary, perhaps, is true. Baron Sonnino, who, it was understood, had hitherto been opposed to all propaganda, appears to have withdrawn his opposition, and, as a result, not only was energetic nationalist propaganda commenced on an extensive scale in Paris and in London during the period in review this country was visited by. several of the most able Italian nationalist publicists, such as Attilio Tamaro, Armando Hodnig, and Virginio Gayda but a strong effort was made to bring Italian public opinion itself up to the point of demanding the satisfaction of very far-reaching claims. In the Italian papers of the 12th and 13th March there was published a long summary of the Italian Delegation^ memorandum to the Peace Conference, which, in a sentence, might be said to have demanded the fulfilment of the London Agreement and. the cession of Fiume. Only a part of Dalmatia was claimed and this was singled out for criticism by the nationalist extremists, otherwise nationalist opinion was more or less satisfied.3. Before the publication of President Wilson&apos;s memorandum, there were many signs in Italy of misgivings as io the course of the peace discussions. In general, there was discontent with what even friendly papers had begun to characterise as Anglo-Saxon imperialism, and, in this connection, one or two absurd stories went the round of the press. That, for example, concerning the arrangement between the Cunard Company and the Yugo-Slavs over the port of Fiume, secured great prominence, while the denial was relegated to comparative obscurity. France also was not free from reproach&quot; the chief counts against the French being their unwillingness to cede the port of Jibouti, and anxiety to promote a Danubian Confederation with the object of preventing German-Austria&apos;s adhesion to the German Empire. A little later, the studied courtesy in Paris to the Austrian Peace Delegation was to lead to considerable irritation in the Italian press.4. All these causes of friction and discontent were, however, to be overshadowed by President Wilson&apos;s appeal, which Avas published in the Rome papers on the 25th April. Before this, presumably immediately after the handing of President Wilson&apos;s memorandum to Signor Orlando, which had taken place on the 14th April, there was a concerted anti-Wilson movement. When the appeal to the Italian people was published, this agitation was redoubled, and a practically unanimous rally to Signor Orlando was the outcome. After this had been effected, the violent campaign against Great Britain and the United States, which the authorities had promoted&apos;, or indeed even encouraged, was somewhat restrained, the poet d&apos;Annunzio being prohibited from addressing a meeting in Rome. This measure and others like it had Mphe effect of drawing upon the Government the lire which had been directed against the Anglo-Saxon Allies, and, at about this date, began the movement for weakening Signor Orlando&apos;s position; from the Nationalists, because he was considered to be too[1130]-758
conciliating; from Signer Nitti, because he judged the moment opportune for creating a coalition in his own support, and so to attaining Ins ambition; and of the Giolittians, because their leader considered the time ripe for effective intervention.5. From now onwards several disquieting reports and other evidences pointing to a revival of pro-Germanism, or pro-Magyarism, or even pro-Turk ism in high Italian circles began to be received. There was reliable news, for example, that Italian agents were treating with members of the Committee of Union and Progress at Constantinople. As regards pro-Germanism in Italy, the tone of thy vast majority of the Italian papers when the peace terms with Germany were made known could not be mistaken ; it was decidedly sympathetic to Germany. Northern Italian towns began to be visited by German commercial agents, and cases were reported of new German goods being sold in Milan. Two significant incidents were the re-establishment of direct correspondence between Rome and the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; by the correspondent there, Mario Passarge, announced in the Berlin paper for the 26th May, and the publication in the &quot; Giornale d Italia &quot; of the 6th May of an interview with Prince bulow supporting-Italy^ claims to Fiume, Zara, Sebenico, and Spalato. Italian pro-Magyarism becmne very pronounced after the Communist revolution in Budapest, which was used as an argument for establishing Italy on the Dalmatian coast. At first, sympathy was openly shown only to the non-Bolshevik Magyars, the &quot; Corriere della Sera,&quot; in particular, protesting against the &quot; monstrous plan &quot; for a Czecho-Slovak corridor cut across the living body of&apos; Hungary; but sympathy, secret if not openly shown, soon spread to Bolshevik Hungary, and during May and at the beginning of June there were numerous reports not only in the Viennese press which might well be written clown as biassed  but from reliable observers, as to the constant travelling of Italian officers between Budapest and Vienna, and several dealings in arms with the Hungarian Communists. Specific cases of the despatch from Italy, against the protests of the Vienna Govern-ment, of trainloads of munitions to Budapest and the return of consignments of gold have been described, and even mentioned openly in British papers.&quot;:i:&quot; It was evident that Italy&apos;s conflicting interests, with the Greeks, the smaller Slav countries, and the Great Powers which supported them, were leading her to find a common basis for action with Turkey as well as with her former partners in the Triple Alliance, German-Austria excepted.6. During the period under review, particularly towards the end of May and in the lirst weeks of June, the situation was complicated by a crisis in domestic affairs. On the 19th March the decision had been taken by the Executive of the Italian Socialist Party to sever its connection with the Second Internationale, which had just concluded its Conference at Berne, and to adhere to the Third Communist Internationale, founded at Moscow on the 2nd March. This s-tep had the effect of stimulating political action, a direct outcome being a successful strike at Genoa, with the object of preventing the despatch of munitions to Russia. At the end of May and beginning of June there were large strikes in Naples, Milan, Biella, and Pome, a general strike in the last being-only narrowly averted. , The causes were in the first place political, and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, who visited Rome early in June to attempt to persuade Italian Socialists to re-enter the Second Internationale, reported Signor Lazzari,&apos;the Secretary of the party, as having declared that &quot; the purpose of the Allies&apos; policy in Russia is hot to displace one revolutionary Government in favour of another, but to crush all movement of the proletariat in Europe.&quot; To counter this the Italian Socialists came to a working-agreement with the trades union organisation, the Confederazione Generale del Lavoro, changing its character from that of a purely industrial.and syndicalist movement into that of a revolutionary and political combination. &quot;Unemployment and the extremely high price of food contributed to the discontent, and, with the resignation of the Food Minister, Signor Orlando returned to Rome there to face the Chamber.7. Signor Orlando&apos;s Government fell on a question of procedure, the Chamber refusing, by 259 votes to 78, to accept the Premiers proposal that it should go into secret session. But, in fact, this was a vote of &quot;no confidence,&quot; and the largeness of the vote against Orlando is explained by the unexpected opposition of the Giolittians, who had, led by their chief himself, taken their stand with the Government on the question of Fiume. : Evidently the Giolittians and the party Signor&apos; Nitti had been working for two or three months to gather round him judged the moment opportune for seizing the reins of power. During May there had been numerous meetings of Giolitti&apos;s supporters in the house of Signor Colosimo, the President of the Chamber, as. well as a great deal of agitation by Signor Nitti in the direction of forming a* See &quot; Morning Post,&quot; June 6 ; &quot; Daily Telegraph,&quot; June 13&apos;; and &quot; New Europe,&quot; June 19.
Socialist-Clerical Bloc favourable to himself. It may be recalled that last March, when both Nitti and Giolitti voted for the Government on the Frame question, the intervention of Nitti was ridiculed by the Nationalist &quot; Idea Nazionaie &quot; as &quot; a ridiculously obvious attempt to place himself at the head of the Giolittian Socialist Majority.&quot; That attempt now succeeded, as the list of the new Ministers who took the oath on the 23rd June amply demonstrated.8. The following is the list of the new Italian Ministers : Premier and Minister of the Interior	....   Signor Nitti.	Foreign Minister	...      ,,	Tittoni.Treasury	...      ,,	Schanzer.Finance	...      ,,	Tedesco,Public Works........	...      ,,	Pantano.Transport		De Vito.IMu cation		Baccelli.Military Assistance  ...	...      ,,	Da Como.Justice...	...      ,,	Mortara.Colonies     - ...	...      ,,	Ilossi.Post Office.............	...      ,,	Chimienti.Agriculture   ...	...      ,,	Visocchi.Liberated Territories...		Nava.Commerce, Labour, and Provisions...	...      ,,	Ferraris.Marine!..	...   Rear-Admiral Sect	War...............	...   General Albricchi	The new Cabinet represents a complete change from the immediately preceding Government, in which none of the new Ministers was holding office on its fall. Signor Nitti was Minister of Agriculture in the Giolittian Cabinet of 1911-1914, and Minister of Finance under Signor Orlando until January 1919. His policy was considered to be a failure. As regards his foreign sympathies, he always in his public pronouncements expressed admiration and gratitude to Great Britain, but personal acquaintances described him as a purely opportunist statesman and a man of great ambition. The two other prominent Giolittians in the Cabinet are Signori Tedesco and Schanzer, both able administrators like their leader. On the administrative and purely domestic side, in fact, the Cabinet is strong The new Minister of Commerce, for example, Signor Ferraris, is a very able economist, identified with no particular-party.9. On the side of foreign policy the same favourable opinion cannot be recorded. Signor Nitti. as has been said, is an opportunist, while Signor Tittoni, who has twice before been Foreign Minister,, -was very closely connected with the policy of the alliance with Germany, and is a very intimate acquaintance of Signor Giolitti. He may be said to stand as the representative of Giolittfs policy in the Cabinet, which that politician, though he did not enter it himself, has been careful to see nearly half filled with his lieutenants. It may be remarked that already a strong opposition to the Government among the Interventionists has begun that is, among that group which was conspicuously anti-German from the beginning, and helped to nullify Giolittian influences in bringing Italy into the war. Whether this will be sufficient to counteract the clever Giolittiau, manoeuvring it is at present impossible to say. We are in any case likely to see more efficient, though perhaps not more popular, domestic administration, but on the foreign side a purely opportunist policy, with a delinite orientation towards Germany should the Allies not be able to secure some satisfaction of Italian territorial claims. The only practicable alternative, to the Nitti-Tittoni Government a Luzzatti Cabinet seems out of the question for the moment.o
