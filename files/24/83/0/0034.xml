1STPOLICE   BILL.(Ciroulatod by the Home Secretary).I have now received the Report of Lord Deeborough&apos;a Committee on the Police service and I desire authority from the Cabinet to include certain of its recommendations in the Polioe Sill, whioh must be introduced at once.As regards pay the Committee recommend a scale of pensionable pay for Constables rising from 70/** a week (as already promised by the Government) to 95/-;  for Sergeants a soale rising from 100/- to 112/6d. weekly;   and a correspondingly increased pay for the higher ranks.    They also recommend for all ranks rent-free houses or non-pensionable allowances in lieu of rent, and a uniform boot allowance of l/6d a week.    All these increases to take effect (as promised by the Government) from 1st April last.These re-commendations must, I presume, he aooepted.    They do not require any legislative sanotion, except authority for the provision of the necessary funds.The following points in the Report require consideration in connection with the Bill:-(l) The Committee recommend that as &quot;the duties of a policeman are fundamentally the same in oharaoter throughout the forces of Great Britain&quot;, the conditions of service should be standardised with regard to rates of pay,&quot; pensions, allowances and conditions of service generally (paragraph 22), and they indicate (paragraph 58) that such standardisation as regards pay should be obtained by giving power to the Secretary of State and Secretary for Sootland to review the rates of pay from time to time, after affording to the Police Authorities, Chief Constables and other rankB of the Polioe &quot;opportunity to submit their representations by duly authorised means&quot;.    This&apos; is provided for in Clause 4 of the draft Bill.It may be observed that the Seoretary of State already possesses powers to regulate the pay, etc of County Polioe forces, and the effect of the clause is ?$erely to extend this to Boroughs and t* add the requirement that representatives of the Poliae and Polioe Authorities should be consulted.    I may add that more than a year ago the representatives of all the largest Boroughs In England asked that the Hone Office should take such powers-(2) The Committee recommend a new pension scale for retirement without medioal certificate to be fixed for all forces in Great Britain on the following basis: viz. all ranks to be entitled after 25 years1 approved service to a pension at the rate of one-half the annual pensionable pay at the date of retirement, and after 30 years&apos; approved service to a pension of two-thirds of the pay, with intermediate rates for intermediate periods:   this soale to apply to all new entrants, but to serving members only with their own oonsent.    The proposed scale will be more favourable to the Polioe than the aoale now in force in Sootland and in a few English foroeB.    Legislation will be necessary to permit of its adoption in Sootland and to provide for its general adoption in England for new entrants.
;%\ ,    .h   2   &quot;**(3) The Committee reoonmend that a &quot;National Representative Body&quot; be formed * &apos;&apos;&apos;for the Police.    Shis is provided for in the. Bill.  .(4) As regards the provision far the&quot; increased coot of pay^which wil-1^   &apos; amount to a large sum (See Appendix) the Committee make &apos;the&apos;f611owingv recomroendationt   &quot;The direct supplementary grant from, Imperial Funds-which wan instituted last year to be increased from, and including, the financial year 1918/19, go as to cover at least one-half of the cost of the Polioe Including the cost of pensions without any additional charge being thrown&apos; ori the Exchequer Contribution Account by reason, of the increase in the cost&apos; of pay and clothing, and this direot grcmt to be calculated In each year on the expenditure of&quot;that year instead of on the expenditure of the previous year&quot;.It is not necessary, and, so far as I can judge, not desirable to insert any provision on this subject in the Bill, provided the necessary funds for the increased Government subsidy are obtained&apos;by means of a supplementary vote. It will, however, be absolutely necessary to give a pledge that the funds will be provided otherwise the opposition of the Looal Authorities will make it impossible to pass the Bill.    The financial questions- to which this proposal gives rise, involving as they do the whole existing scheme of Government grants in aid of looal taxation, are extremely complicatedJ , and it io very desirable that the basis of. the grant should be settled on clear and equitable lines. 1 suggest that there should be an immediate Conference between the officers of the Treasury and the Home Office to settle the best way in which&apos; the grant can be made. dI ask for the authority of the War Cabinet to include in the Bill the proposals as to standardisation of pay and conditions of service, and as to the new pensions scale, and to promise the grant from Imperial^ionds rccommendod by the Committee. 1   &apos;E.S.&apos;&apos;&apos;   5th July, 1919.     ,ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF GIVING EFFECT TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE police service COMMITTEE.A* Metropolitan Police.      .The Receiver finds that the proposed so.ale of pay for constables will give an average rate of 89/- a week in the present&apos;force in which the majority are men of long service.He reckons the number of the force for the present year at 17,000 which is 3,000 short of the authorized strength and also excludes 2,000 men paid for by Government Departments and private persons.

The cost per man for pay &amp;c, in forces other than the Metropolitan is taken at  270 (slightly less than the Metropolitan average as in some forces the rent aid will be less) and the numbers at 34,000 (2,500 less than the authorized strength).    In other expenditure an increase of 75 per oent is assumed except in pensions in which the 1914 figure is followed.ESTIMATED COST OF POLICE for JL919-20:-Metropolitan.....*    ***    ***      6,260,000County &amp; Borough and City of London     11,250,000TOTAL   - 17,510,000HALF TOTAL   - 8,755,000        8,755,000DEDUCTPayments from Exchequer ContributionAccount for 1913-14.               - 2,470,000Local Taxation Grant                    - 300,000Grant in Vote now before Parliament 1,875,000        4,645,0004,110,000.This would point to a supplementary vcte of about  4,000,000: but there will be required also an increased vote for Scotland, and, if the Committee^ recommenda-tion to supplement the payment for 1918^19 is.accepted, a further sum on this account will have to be provided.

COMMITTEE ON THE POLICE SERVICE.REPORT-PART I.To the Eight Hon. EDWARD SHORTT, K.C., M.P., His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State forthe Home Department.Sir,. 1. We have the honour to present the First Part of our Report on the inquiry you instructed us to make with regard to the methods of recruiting, conditions of service, rates of pay, pensions and allowances of the Police Forces of England, Wales and Scotland. In this Report we deal principally with certain questions of organization, pay, housing arrangements and rent aid,, and certain general conclusions on the subject of pensions. Our detailed recommendations with regard to pensions and a large number of other questions remain to be dealt with in a further Report.2. We have held 34 sittings, including 30 for hearing evidence, and have heard 148 witnesses, as follows:-Mr. H. B. Simpson and Mr. W. A, C. Goodchild, representing the Home Office andthe Scottish Office respectively; The Commissioners of the Metropolitan and City Police; Sir Edward Henry (late Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police), Sir Basil Thomson (then Mr. Basil Thomson),  Assistant Commissioner,  Criminal Investigation Department,  the&apos; Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District, and Mr. G. H. Gardner, Scotland Yard;Sir Leonard Dunning and Major-General L. W. Atcherley^, H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary for England and Wales, Captain W. H. Tomasson, Chief Constable . of Nottinghamshire and Acting Inspector of Constabulary, and Lieut.-Col. A. G. Ferguson, H,M. Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland; 20 Chief Constables of County and &quot;Borough Police Forces in England and Wal^s; 7 Chief Constables of County and Burgh Police Forces in Scotland; 11 representatives from the various ranks of the Metropolitan Police; 4 representatives from the various ranks of the City of London Police; 26 representatives from the various ranks of 7 County Police Forces in England and Wales;24 representatives from the various ranks of 8 City and Borough Police Forces in England and Wales; 7 representatives from the various ranks of 3 County Police Forces in Scotland; 15 representatives from the various ranks of 4 City and Burgh Police Forces inScotland (including 8 witnesses from the Glasgow City Police); 14 representatives of Local Authorities of England and Wales, including the County Councils&apos; Association, Association of Municipal Corporations, and Conferences of&apos; Police Authorities of (a) the 10 largest City Police Forces, (b) County Police Forces in the North of England, (c) Police Authorities in the South Western Counties; 8 representatives of Local Authorities in Scotland, including the Convention of Royal -Burghs, the Association of County Councils in Scotland and the Police Authorities of Glasgow and Edinb\irgh. 3.   Apart from certain evidence of a general character, we desired to hear first the represen-tations of the various ranks of the Police Service, b\it we were faced with the difficulty that our reference covered not merely a single Police Force, or even a few, but nearly 250 separate Police Forces, varying from the Metropolitan Police, with a total authorised strength of over 21,500 men, to the County Forces policing the sparsely populated parts of Scotland and Wales and small Borough Forces of 12 men or even less.   It was obviously impossible for us to hear witnesses from the various ranks of all, or nearly all, these forces without prolonging our inquiry to inordinate lengths, but we considered it essential to obtain a comprehensive presentation of the grievances, claims and aspirations in the minds of the men, as well as the views of the Police Authorities thereon.   We therefore decided to select a number of Forces of various types which we considered would together be representative of the Service generally, and invited evidence from these Forces, at the same time making it known that though the Committee could not hear witnesses from all Forces they would consider any representations which might be submitted to them in writing.   The selection of the witnesses to speak for the Forces was left to the men themselves; where a Representative Board existed the witnesses were generally chosen and their proposed evidence considered by, and submitted on behalf of, the Board, and&apos; in other cases the men were afforded all necessary facilities for electing their representatives and drawing up their evidence.   We are satisfied that in the evidence submitted by the witnesses whom we heard and the numerous memoranda which have reached us during the course of our inquiry, we have obtained a thoroughly comprehensive presentation of the views of the varknis ranks of the Police throughoxvt Great Britain.4. As regards the Chief Constables, we made use of the &quot; District Conferences&quot; inaugurated during the war by the Home Office. Under this scheme the country is divided into eight Districts; the Chief Constables of the County and Borough Forces in each District meet together from time to time to discuss matters of police administration, and appoint two of their number from each Conference to form a Central Conference which meets with representatives of the(23873-40.)   Wt. 9813-C 155.   15,15, 15, 75.  7/19.  D &amp; S.  G. 35.
Home Office. Questions of pay, &amp;c, are not ordinarily considered by these Conferences, having been excluded from their scope by the Home Office when the Conferences were&apos; instituted, but at our request the Chief Constables in each District met and drew up a memorandum of their views on a number of questions and appointed two or more of their number to give evidence thereon. We have heard Chief Constables from six of the eight District Conferences. Six Chief Constables from the Scottish Forces gave joint evidence on behalf of their colleagues as a whole.5. In the case of the Police Authorities, no such organisation as the Chief Constables&apos; District Conferences exists, but we were able to obtain representative evidence through, certain Conferences which were instituted last year at the instance of the Home Office to consider the question of the further standardisation of police pay. Certain of these Conferences were called together again at our instance, including a Conference of the County Police Authorities of the North of England, the Police Authorities in the South Western Counties and the Watch Committees of the 10 largest City Forces. Where there was a division of opinion among the Police Authorities represented, e.g., as to the further increase of police pay, we heard evidence representative of the different points of view.Status of the Police.6. The primary function of the Police is the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of the peace. Each constable on appointment makes a declaration of service to the Crown before a Magistrate. The terms of the declaration in use in the Metropolitan Police* ore as follows:-&quot; I, A  B , being appointed a constable of the Police Force of the Metropolitan Police District, do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lord the King in the office of a constable, and that I will act as a constable for preserving the peace and preventing robberies and other felonies, and appre-hending offenders against the peace, and in all respects, to the best of my skill and knowledge, discharge all the duties, of the said office faithfully according to law.&quot; But from the earliest times the maintenance of law and order in this country has been a matter priniaiily for the Local Authorities originally the Magistrates and now the Magistrates and Police Authori-ties as constituted by later enactments and the theory of the law has been that the concern of the Crown in regard to the Police (excepting the Metropolitan Police) is mainly that&quot; of seeing that the Local Authorities keep up the local forces rather than the exercise of direct control over them. We consider it important, also to bear in mind that the constable, even in the - execution of hi? duty for the preservation of peace, acts not as an agent of the Government, exercising powers derived from that fact, but as a citizen, representing the rest of the community, and exercising powers which, at any rate in their elements, are possessed by all citizens alike. The citizen is still bound, at the direction of a magis-trate, or on the appeal of a constable, to take his part in the preservation of the peace and siippression of disorder, and in this country the whole power of the constable rests on the support, both moral and physical, of his fellow citizenst We desire to emphasize this point as, in our opinion, it has an important bearing on the relations between the Police and the public as to the consideration to which the Police are entitled on the one hand, and their obligations to the public on the other.7. As regards the measure of control which the Crown possesses over the Police, one Force, the Metropolitan Police, with a strength of about 21,500, or nearly one-third of the total strength of the whole of the Police in Great Britain, is under the direct control of the Home Secretary. Besides acting as local Police for the capital of the Empire and its vicinity, this Force is. employed for the protection of the person of the Sovereign, his family and his Ministers, and for State functions, in watching Government Dockyards, in carrying out the extradition of criminals surrendered to foreign countries, and for other purposes of an Imperial and national, as distinguished from a merely local, importance. Apart from sums received for Police specially employed by Government Departments and certain special payments from the Exchequer in respect of services of an Imperial and national character, the salaries of the Commissioner, Assistant Commissioners and the Eeceiver, the expenses of the Metro-politan Police are defrayed from a fund raised partly from the proceeds of a rate levied on the parishes in the Metropolitan Police District and partly from contributions from the Exchequer, the proportion defrayed from the rates being at present, for reasons which we indicate in paragraph 86, more than half the annual cost.8. In England and Wales, each of the- County Police Forces: (58 in number, with a total authorised strength of nearly 18,000) is under the control of the Chief Constable, who appoints, promotes and dismisses members of the Force, and has the general government of them subject to the authority of a Committee the Standing Joint Committee-which is composed half of representatives of the Justices assembled in Quarter Sessions (the former Police Authority) and half of representatives of the County Council. - The Secretary of State has power under the County Police Act, 1839, to make rules for the &quot; government, pay, clothing and accoutrements and necessaries &quot; of these forces; and the appointment of the Chief Constable, any change in the strength of the force, plans for police stations, &amp;c, are subject to his approval.9. There are now 128 Cities and Boroughs with Police Forces, separate from the County Forces, having a total authorised strength of nearly 19,000.   The City and Borough Forces* In some forces the, declaration follows the slightly different wording of the constable&apos;s oath which is set out in section 1 of the Special Constables Act, 1831. . .        . ,t Dunning, 1508.    :&quot; .....
are-managed by a Committee of the TownCouncil, known as the Watch Committee, who appoint the Chief Constable and also the other members of the force. The Secretary of State has not the same power to make rules for the Borough Police, nor is his approval required for any increase of strength, &amp;c, as it is in the case of theCounly Police. It is worth noting that the difference in the law relating to the County and Borough Police: is.due to historical causes, the constitution of the Borough Police haying been settled in 1835 when municipal corporations were reformed and put on a uniform statutory basis, while the County Police were an entirely new creation made possible in 1839 and obligatory in .1856 for all parts1 of England and Wales&quot;-which- were not watched by the older Borough Forces of the Metropolitan Police. .        .  : .   &quot;- - .10. The cost of the County and Borough Police, like the cost of the. Metropolitan Police,: is met partly from the rates and partly from contributions from the Exchequer. The pay-men t of the Exchequer contribution is subject by Statute to the grant by the Secretary of State of a certificate as to the efficient maintenance of the force in point of number^ and discipline. The Secretary of State&apos;s certificates of efficiency are granted on the report of H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, by whom- each force is inspected at least: once a year. The Exhequer contribution to the Police Pension Funds is further subject to a certificate that the management and efficiency of the force and the administration of the pension fund have been satisfactory.11. The City of London has an independent Police Force with a strength of 1,160, estab-lished partly by special statutes and partly by powers of local government derived from ancient charters. Until the present year the City Police received no Government contributions and.was independent Of Government control, but it is Understood that the Force will now come under inspection and receive a Government grant.*12. In Scotland there are 8.1 County and 29 City and Burgh Forces, with a total strength of 5,953 of all ranks; the Glasgow City Force constitutes one-third of the whole (1,996 men). The Police Authority in the County is the Police Committee of the County Council, which is known as the Standing Joint Committee and consists of an equal number of representatives of the County Council and the Commissioners of Supply of the County, and in the Burgh the Police Authority is the Town Council. These bodies fix the strength and scales of pay of the Police, subject (in the case of Burghs as well as County Forces) to the approval of the Secretary for Scotland, who is also empowered to make rules for the pay, clothing and government of the Scottish Forces. The Exchequer contribution is subject to the grant of a certificate of efficiency by the Secretary for Scotland, and the forces are inspected by H.M. Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland. The Orkney Police, Zetland Police, and the Burgh of Berwick Police are at present outside the ordinary statutes. They do not come under the Rules&apos; and are not subject to inspection.13. There are a number of other bodies of Police, such as those employed by the Railway Companies, the Port of London Authority, the Tyne River Commissioners, which do not come under Government inspection- and are independent of central control. We have not considered these Police as within our Terms of Reference and they are not included in our recommenda? tions in this Report.Remarks on the General Police System.14. In the course of our inquiry, many cases have been brought to our notice of men in different forces who are doing precisely the same work but serve under materially different rates trf pay and other conditions, and we have been particularly impressed by this lack of assimilation between the conditions in the various Police Forces. Thixmgh the Secretary of State&apos;s Rules and the activities of the Inspectors a certain measure of uniformity of administration is secured, but it appears from Mr. Simpson&apos;sevidencet that even in respect of the pay of the County Police, which is subject to Home Office control, the general policy of the Home Office until last year was to treat the several Forces as independent of each other and little had been done to assimilate the scales of pay. As we have pointed out, the Home Office has not;the same control over the pay of the Borough Police, and in other directions besides pay, such as housing, allow-ances of all kinds, leave, and to a certain degree pensions, hours of duty and other conditions of service, we find many wide differences between one force and another, and we are satisfied that these differences have very materially contributed to the unrest and dissatisfaction which have prevailed of late in the Police.15. The first question therefore to which we have directed our attention is the possibility of further standardisation of pay and other conditions throughout the service, either through a radical change of system, such as nationalisation of the whole Police of the country, or by standardisation of conditions through an extension of the Rule-making power of the Home Office and the Scottish Office and closer supervision by H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary.Nationalisation of the Police.16. We first considered&apos;the subject of nationalisation, that is to say, bringing all the police under the direct control of a Central Authority, say the Home Office or the Scottish Office, or a specially constituted Ministry.117. If the Police Service were nationalised the Government would then be in a position to fix not only the rates of pay and conditions throughout the service but would be responsible for their enforcement through their own officers and for the management of the Police in every respect. Sir Basil Thomsont considered that nationalisation would be an advantage from the point of view of the work of the Criminal Investigation Department, but few witnesses hane been prepared to commit themselves to any definite opinion in favour of it.   On the other hand the* Nott-Bower, 2046.. f Simpson, 28. \ Thomson, 549, 564. -
adoption of direct central control of the Police would be foreign to the constitutional principle&apos; to which we have referred in paragraph 6, by which the preservation of law and order in this country is primarily the function of the proper local authorities: it would alter the whole basis of the police system, and in particular would prejudice the intimate relations between the Police and the localities where they serve which many experienced witnesses have regarded as one of the most desirable characteristics of the present system and to which they attribute in great measure the happy relations which have existed between the Police and the general public in this country.18. It is, however, obvious from the evidence that the administration of all local Police Authorities is not equally good and tliat under the present system lack of uniformity has developed to an undesirable degree. Whilst we consider that the present system of control &quot;is sound in general principle, and best suited to the circumstances of this country, we are of opinion that the Police administration would be more economical and efficient if a greater measure of centralisation and standardisation of conditions of service could be introduced. Various suggestions have been made to us for enlarging the units of local administration by grouping a number of County or Borough Police Authorities into a single joint authority for purposes of Police control, and for merging the smaller Boroughs into the County Forces, and we shall make recommendations with regard to these matters in a later Report.Standardisation of Pay and. other Conditions of Service.19. As to the possibility of standardisation, it might appear at first sight that the duties of the Police differ in some respects in different parts of the country. But even though the work of a constable or sergeant on beat or point duty in the City of London or in the clerical branch in any large city force is very different from, say, beat duty in the Highlands of Scotland or any rural county, what we&quot; have to consider is whether such differences are fundamental or render the work in one force more exacting than it is in another to such a degree as to justify separate treatment of the forces in regard to pay, pensions, &amp;c. We have heard much evidence on this question.* We do not gather that the duties of the average constable in the Metropolitan Police District or the City of London are more exacting or differ much from those of a constable in, say, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow, or any of the great City Forces: and we found that the claims advanced by the constables and sergeants of the Metropolitan Police and various large City Forces that their work is more exacting than work iu a country district were strenuously denied by witnesses from the County Forces, and men from the latter who had experience of both town and country work declared that they preferred the former and found it on the whole no harder than the latter. The typical &quot;country policeman is stationed alone in a village and is responsible for the police duty in the village and a beat extending perhaps four or five miles, or in sparsely populated areas even further, in each direction. The matters with which the typical town policeman has to deal cover a wide field, but the country policeman&apos;s duties appear to be no less varied and, apart from occasional visits of a sergeant or superior officer, he has to act in all matters on his individual responsibility and without any possibility of summoning assistance. The country policeman requires to be essentially an &quot;all round &quot; man to a greater degree than the average policeman in a large City Force. The work of a town policeman on point duty at a busy traffic centre no doubt subjects him to greater strain while it lasts than does the beat duty of an average country policeman, but when his tour of eight hours&apos; duty is finished the town policeman (apart from special emergencies) is free until he is due for duty again, while the house of the country policeman, whether it is a police station proper with a cell for prisoners or a residence pure and simple, is marked as &quot; Police Station &quot; and the constable has to attend to any matter which may be reported to him at any hour of the night or day. If a telephone is-provided, his wife is expected to answer it in his absence. Duty in town may be more dangerous than in the country, but the country policeman suffers as much or more from exposure to the weather. As to the general amenities of life, there is a good deal to be said on either side. For a man! with young children, the country will have advantages which, when his children are older, may be counterbalanced by the better facilities for education or employment in the town.20. A further consideration is that such differences as do exist between town and country work are not merely differences between separate forces but exist to practically as great degree between individual members of one and the same force. For example, a Metropolitan police-man may have to do duty in the East End or in one of the outlying parts of the Metropolitan Police District, and his work in the latter would differ in no respect from that of a constable in one of the adjoining counties of Essex, Herts, Surrey or Kent; or again, in certain counties, for example, Lancashire, Staffordshire and&apos; Worcestershire, populous county boroughs such as Bury, West Bromwich, Smethwick, Dudley, as well as the rural and sparsely populated parts of the county, are policed by the County Force, so that a constable may be serving at one time in one of these towns and at another in a remote country village. These differences would make any classification of forces by the character of their work very difficult to carry out on any equitable basis.21.   It is further noteworthy that the evidence from the Scottish Police and Police Authorities was strongly in favour of the pay, pensions and other conditions of service of the-Scottish Police being assimilated to those of the Police in England and Wales, and no valid grounds for any distinction were suggested to us.t* Macready, 185-7 ; Olive, 797-803, 931 ;.

&quot;22, Having carefully considered the evidence on these points, we have come definitely to the conclusion that the duties of a policeman are fundamentally the same in character throughout the forces within our terms of reference; that such differences as exist between .pne force and another do not justify the wide differences in pay, pensions and housing con-ditions; and that the Police Service of Great Britain should be considered as a whole for the purpose of settling the main questions with regard to rates of pay, pensions, allowances and conditions of service generally,23.   We therefore recommend (a) that a standard scale of pensionable pay should be fixed for constables and sergeants in the Metropolitan Police, City of London Police and all County and Borough Police Forces in Great Britain, with retrospective effect as from 1st April, 19.19; (6) that the scales of pay of the higher ranks should be revised on the general lines which we indicate in paragraphs 49, 50, 55 and 56, also with retrospective effect;(c) that the wide differences which now exist between one force and another in thematter of housing arrangements should be removed and conditions assimilated on the basis we indicate in paragraph 64;(d) that the various alternative scales of pension on retirement without medical certifi-cate provided in the Police Act, 1890, and the scale prescribed in the Police (Scotland): Act, 1890, should be replaced by a single scale (see paragraph 78); and(e) that conditions generally should be assimilated in various other matters which weshall mention below or in the Second Part of our Report,Pensionable Pay.24. As regards the pensionable pay of the Police, the original Rules for the County Con--stabulary, which were made by the Secretary of State in 1886, propose seven different weekly rates for constables and six for sergeants, to be adopted according to local circumstances. These Rules have never been revised. The scales of pay, therefore, have been out of date for many years (the highest scale for constables is 235. id. rising to 29s. 2d. per week), and their only importance is the fact that, inasmuch as the Rules provide that no higher scales than those prescribed can be fixed without the approval of the Secretary of State, all alterations of the pay of the County Police have to be submitted for the Secretary of State&apos;s approval. It appears, however, from Mr. Simpson&apos;s evidence that until&quot; last year little had been done by the Home Office in the direction of standardisation of pay. Mr. Simpson says* &quot; Though the Home Office Inspectors of Constabulary, through their inspections, secure a considerable measure of uniformity among the different County and Borough Forces in some respects, these forces have till recently been treated by the Home Office as entirely independent of each other. The rates of pay given in one force, of course, affected what would be given in a neighbouring force, and it has been a generally recognised principle that a county constable should be paid at a somewhat higher rate than the agricultural labourer in his county, but till recently little has been done to assimilate scales of pay.&quot; &quot; County Forces came to the Home Office from time to time for sanction to new scales of pay, and generally speaking sanction was given without demur till the outbreak of war.&quot; Mr. Simpson explained that certain counties had been accustomed to act more or less together in fixing scales of pay, but this does not seem to have affected the position very materially. As already explained, the Borough Police Authori-ties fixed their scales of pay independently of the Home Office. Thus, at the outbreak of war the scales of pay varied considerably. For example, the scale for constables in Dorset was&quot; 21s. rising to&apos;26s. 10c/., with an allowance for rent; in the Metropolitan Policet and two or three provincial boroughs, 30s. rising to 42s.; and in one or two County Forces, 28s. rising to 35s. or thereabouts with quarters free or practically free. Further examples of the pre-war rates of pay are given in Appendix 1.25. For the first three years after the outbreak of war the policy of the Home Office,X following that adopted in the Civil Service, &quot; was generally to refuse sanction to any incx^ease of pensionable pay, but to allow County Police Authorities at their discretion to meet the increased cost of living by a terminable allowance or war bonus.&quot; The same policy was followed by the Home Office in the case of the Metropolitan Police (except for an increase of pay which, though taking effect after the outbreak of war, had been decided upon before that time) and also by the Scottish Office, The Metropolitan Police were granted, in March, 1915, a war bonus of 3s. weekly, which was increased in June, 1917, to 8s., and in December, 1917, to 12s. The children&apos;s allowance was first granted in October, 19.16, at the rate of Is. weekly for each child, and was increased to Is.-6c/. in March, 1917, and to 2s. 6c/. in December, 1917. War bonuses were granted from time to time by the County Police Authorities at their dis--cretion, generally without reference to the Home Office, and the amounts varied considerably. Some Borough Police Authorities adopted the policy of granting non-pensionable war bonuses, but in other forces the pay was raised. In this way the differences between one force and another became greater than before the war.26. At the end of 1917 the question of granting some increase of pensionable pay to the County Police was becoming rather acute, and a conference of Police Authorities of the Home Counties was held to consider the claims for increased pay, and, in order to avoid competition, a scale was agreed upon and subsequently-adopted, by all the authorities represented.. In January, 1918) the Home Secretary issued a circular to all County and Borough Police Authorities recommending the holding of similaivconferences, and a number of conferences were formed and had a certain effect in levelling up the pay of the Police, hut only to a limited . degree, and in August, 1918, there were still wide differences between the remuneration of* Simpson. 28,29. &apos;. f Simpson, 29,30. &quot;tin the Metropolitan Police an allowance of ls..Gd. to 2s. 6d. was and is paid by way of rent aid and all -single constables are provided with quarters at a charge of Is. 01. weekly.

In the autumn of 1918 the Home Office took steps which have now produced a consider-able measure of uniformity in the pensionable pay of constables and sergeants throughout the country. In September the Home Office announced the terms of a new Treasury grant towards Police expenditure, under which the payment of the grant is conditional on the Home Secretary&apos;s approval as regards the purposes of the expenditure, the rates of pay and allowances and the conditions of service. Two scales of pay were laid&apos; down for constables and sergeants: (a) the Metropolitan scale, which is 43*. rising to 53*. for constables and ;56*.: rising to 60*. for uniform section sergeants, and (b) a scale (sometimes called the &quot;standard&quot; scale) which1 is 3*. lower than.the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; scale. One or other of these scales has now been adopted for nearly every County and Borough Force in England&apos; and Wales. Generally speaking, the Metropolitan scale applies in forces north of a line from the Wash to the Mersey, and the &quot;standard&quot; scale applies south of that line except in&apos;the Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police (who have a slightly higher scale than the Metropolitan Police) and a few Borough Forces which have the Metropolitan scale. The amounts paid by way of non-pensionable war bonus vary. For example, in the Sheffield Police all ranks receive an allowance of .19s. Qd, weekly; the Metropolitan Police receive 12*. and an allowance of 2*. 6^. weekly for each child; while one or two Forces receive only the &quot; standard &quot; rate of pay (40*. rising to 50*. weekly) without any addition by way of war bonus or allowances for children.   Further examples of the present rates of pay and bonus are given in Appendix 1.28. In considering the standard rate of pensionable pay which we should recommend we have taken into account not merely, or even mainly, the rates of pay in force before the war and the percentage to be added in consideration of the increase in the cost of living, but we have endeavoured to appraise as well as we can the services rendered by the Police to the community, the standard of qualifications required and the rate of remuneration which seems to us reason-able and proper in all the circumstances and likely to attract recruits of the right stamp. In view of the evidence which we have heard as to the work of the Police and the high standard of qualifications required, we are satisfied that a policeman has responsibilities and obligations which are peculiar to his calling and distinguish him from other public servants and municipal employes, and we consider the Police entitled thereby to special consideration in regard to their rate of pay and pensions.29. A candidate for the Police must not only reach certain standards of height and. physical development, but must have a constitution which is sound in every way. The duties the Police have to perform are varied and exacting; they are increasing, and will probably still increase in variety and complexity, and a man cannot make a good policeman unless his general intelligence, memory and powers of observation are distinctly above the average. His character-should be unblemished: he should be humane and courteous and, generally, he should possess a combination of moral, mental and physical qualities not ordinarily required in other eniploy-ments. Further, when he becomes a constable, he is entrusted with powers which may gravely affect the liberty of the subject, and he must at all times be ready to act with tact and discretion, and on his own initiative and responsibility, in all sorts of contingencies. The burden of individual discretion and responsibility placed upon a constable is much greater than that of any other public servant of subordinate ranlct30! The Police also stand in a special relationship to the community. Each constable on appointment becomes one of the duly constituted guardians of law and order for and on behalf of the citizens as a whole, and, as we have pointed out, he makes a declaration of service to the Crown as such. He undertakes special responsibilities in regard to the prevention and detection of crime, and,, while he does not relieve the citizen from all responsibility&apos; for the protection of&apos; his own property and for bringing offenders to justice, he claims to be and is the principal agent in the prevention and detection of crime of all kinds, and generally holds a position of trust, which it is important he should be able to maintain. We consider it essential that the sense of obligation to the public should be preserved in the Police, and the reason we dwell on these considerations at some length is that they are fundamental to the views we have formed as to the status of the Police and the pay they should receive.3.1*. A number of police witnesses have urged that in various ways a constable is subject to social disabilities by reason of his employment. Moreover, he must at all times, both on and off duty, maintain a standard of personal conduct befitting to his position, and this does impose upon him certain restrictions which do not exist in ordinary employments and hardly apply in the same degree even in the case of other public servants. He is liable to be called for duty at any time in an emergency, and, in order that lie may be available for unexpected calls, he may be restricted in his choice of a -residence. . The special, temptations to which a. constable -is exposed are obvious, and, as any lapse must be severely dealt with, it is only just that his remuneration should be such as will not add to his temptations the difficulties, a-iid anxieties-   ?

The representatives of the men have urged their claim for more pay not only on the&quot; ground that their present pay is not in accordance with the status and responsibilities of the Police, but also that it has not been increased during the war in proportion to the increase in the cost of living and that the married men with families cannot make ends meet on, their present remuneration. On the first point, several of the men&apos;s representatives alluded to the figure 133 per cent, as the increase in the cost of living. This figure, however, is the figure given in the Labour Gazette (November, 1918) as the average increase in the retail prices of foodstuffs. It represents merely what would have been the increase in the cost of&apos; living if it had been possible to maintain a &quot;pre-war standard in respect of food consumption and is not the some as the increase in expenditure on food (allowing for the restrictions on supplies and consumption to which all classes of the community have been subject), and since November last food prices have fallen, the corresponding figure for June, 1919, being 104 per cent.      , .36. According- to the Report of Lord Sumner&apos;s Committee on the Cost of LivingH the increase in the cost of living of the average workman&apos;s family up to September, 1918, was not more than 80 per cent.   The estimates in the Labour Gazette for September, 1918, and June,* Simpson, 28 ; Dunning, 1981 ; Wight, 2623-4 ; Tanner, 4725.f In some Borough Forces the bonus is less than 10s., and in a few no bonus is paid.I The estimated value of the pension rights of a Metropolitan constable (that is to say, the sum which he would have to put,aside, less thejampunts actually deducted from his pay, to secure equal benefits) is 12s. weekly. He also-receives a boot allowance of Is. weekly and uniform. The value of the pension rights in other forces will depend on the pension scale adopted, but will be less than that in the Metropolitan Police, on account of the lower soale of pay.8 These figures are given as quoted by the witnesses as the current rates at the time when they, gave evidence.II Cd. 8980 of 1918.23873bincidental to an inadequate rate of pay. The policeman&apos;$ calling&apos; also exposes him to special dangers! He may at any time have occasion to arrest an armed criminal; he frequently has to deal with drunken persons, who are responsible for the greater part of the crimes against the person, and he may occasionally have to take part in suppressing violent disorder.32. The policeman is also put to certain special expenses by reason of his employment, for example, he not only requires good and sustaining food but the cost of his housekeeping is increased by the irregularity of the hours at which he has to take his meals and the frequent necessity of cooking specially for him; and it is generally, and quite correctly, a condition of service tlftit he may not be concerned, directly or. indirectly, in any trade or business, so that he is precluded from supplementing his wages by undertaking employment for profit in his spare time.33. We are not unmindful that the policeman has important advantages which are not shared by the ordinary workman. In particular, he need make no provision for times of unemployment; he has holidays on full pay; he has the benefit of a pension scheme to which he contributes only a fraction of the total cost (in the English&apos; Police less than one-tenth, at pre-war rates) and which is distinctly more favourable than that enjoyed by any other public servant; and in a good many forces lie is provided with a house or other quarters or receives an allowance towards his rent.34. Having regard, however, to the nature of Police work and to the responsibilities to which we have referred, we consider the pay of a policeman should not be assessed on the basis of that of an agricultural labourer or an unskilled worker as has been the case.* In the course of the evidence, various comparisons have been drawn between the present remunerated-ration of the Police and that in certain other employments, and we give the following figures as indicating the relatively unfavourable position of the Police on their present rates of pay:  (1) Receipts of a Constable with 5 Teams&apos; Service (Married and with two Children) in (a) the Metropolitan Police, and (b) a Force which mat be taken as typical of the Small. Borough Forces.t
1919, which are on a slightly different basis, were 90 per cent, and 95 per cent, respectively. The figures just quoted took account of the reduced consumption. The corresponding figures given in the Labour Gazette, allowing for pre-war consumption in quantity and, as far as possible, quality, are 120-125 per cent, for November last and 105 per cent, at the beginning of June. Talcing all things into consideration we think it would be fair&apos;to suppose that the policeman&apos;s receipts would have to be about double what they were in 1914 to compensate for the increase of prices.37. We have obtained from the various Forces and have carefully examined a large number of &quot;budgets&quot; of household expenditure of constables and sergeants, and a number of typical specimens are printed in Appendix it.&apos;&apos; In some cases the sergeant or constable con-cerned has appeared before us as a witness and we have been able to examine him on the particulars given. The budgets have also been examined by the Department of Labour Statistics of the Ministry of Labour and we quote the following from a letter we have received with regard to them:  So far as the expenditure of the policeman&apos;s family on food, rent and miscellaneous items is revealed by the budgets submitted, it would appear to be confirmed generally by the information in the Department with regard to men of the working classes with similar incomes.As regards clothing, the information is not so good, but so far as the returns go it would appear that where rent is heavy the sum available for clothing out of the ordinary pay is quite inadequate. The rentals are not excessive : a policemans calling would seem to demand that he should live in respectable sur-roundings. The much larger sums spent on clothing in the County Forces, where in many cases houses are presumably rent free, brings out the situation clearly. There does not seem to be room for reasonable economy in any direction.Taking the budgets as a whole and making all allowances for the circumstances in which they have been made out, we are satisfied that they bear out the witnesses&apos; contention that the married men have not sufficient to maintain themselves and their families in a manner suitable to their position.38. Many siiggestions have been made to us.as to a suitable scale of pay for the subordinate ranks. Witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the Metropolitan Police Representative Board suggested the scale 80s. rising to 100s. for constables, with a children&apos;s allowance of 2s. Qd. but no rent aid. The same scale, or a very similar one, was suggested by the witnesses from several large provincial Forces, including Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff and Glasgow. The City of London and one or two provincial Forces suggested higher scales. Several County Forces (including Lancashire and the West Riding) where the men now receive houses or quarters rent free, suggested the scale 70s. rising to 90s., with houses rent free. Some Chief Constables suggested .64s. rising to 80s., and others 70s. rising to 85s. or 90s. and houses rent free. The views of the Police Authorities varied greatly. Some were in favour of the retention of the present Metropolitan or &quot; standard&quot; rate of pay with a war bonus of 10s. or 17s. Qd., or the conversion, of a part of the bonus to pensionable pay; while others approved the scale 70s. rising to 90s. (all pensionable) and free houses, and the Glasgow Police Authority were prepared to agree to 80s. rising to 100s. without any cbildren&apos;s allowance or rent aid.Standard Scale of Pensionable Pay for Constables.39. Taking all things into consideration, we recommend that the standard scale of pensionable pay for constables should be 70s. weekly on the constable&apos;s appointment on probation, rising byfennual increments of 2s. to 90s. weekly, with two further long service increments of 2s. Qd. We shall also recommend that all ranks be provided with a house or quarters rent free, or given allowances in lieu, as detailed in paragraph 64 below. The.scale of pay should be subject to the following conditions :  (a) On first appointment the constable should be regarded as on probation.   The normal v period of probation for a constable first entering the Police should be one year,but may be extended to 18 months if at the end of the first year the constable has not made sufficient progress for his appointment to be confirmed but it is desired to give him a further opportunity of showing that he is likely to become an efficient constable.(b) The constable should receive his first increment at the end of one year, or at such .later date as his appointment may be confirmed, and all subsequent increments up to the tenth (bringing his pay to 90ls. weekly) should be automatic on his com-completing 2 years, 3 years, and so on, reckoned from the date of his first appointment.(c) The grant of the additional long service increments should be at the discretion of theChief Constable and subject to the constable&apos;s good conduct and efficient service, the constable to be eligible to receive the first of such increments (2s. 6dL in amount) after 7 years&apos; service at the ordinary maximum (90s. weekly), and the second increment after a further 5 years&apos; service, subject to the same conditions as to conduct and.efficiency. 40.   We further recommend that a constable with not less than 5 years&apos; service should be eligible for the grant of a special advance of one increment in the scale if his conduct has been good, his service has been marked by special zeal, general intelligence and proficiency, and he passes a qualifying examination in educational subjects and police work of the standard required for promotion; and that a second special advance of one increment might be granted&apos; after a further year if considered justified by the constablefs conduct and efficiency.   A constable who has received two such advances would thus reach the maximum of the ordinary scale (901s.) after 8 years&apos; instead of 10 years&apos; service.   The retention of the special increments should be subject to continued good conduct and efficiency, and if this condition is not satisfied the constable.should revert, to the ordinary scale.

In a number of forces it has been the practice to award merit badges carrying extra pay at the rate of Is. or Is. 2d. weekly, which has been pensionable, for acts of courage or special merit; and badges carrying extra pay have also been awarded in some places for good conduct and proficiency and/or long service. If our proposals in the preceding paragraphs are adopted we do not think it will be necessary to make any further provision for good conduct and proficiency pay, as distinguished from rewards for individual acts of courage or special- merit, and it seems to us that the latter are best rewarded by a grant of a lump sum or a weekly allowance for a limited period and that in any case such grants should not.be reckoned for pension.Standard Scale for Sergeants.43. The scale we recommend for sergeants is 100s. weekly on promotion, rising by five equal annual increments of 2s. Qd. to 112s. Qd. weekly. In the Metropolitan Police, this scale should apply to section sergeants. We deal below with the rank at present designated &quot; Station Sergeant.&quot; . &apos;44. The above standard scales should apply to the Metropolitan and City of London Police and all County and Borough Police Forces in Great Britain.  .Station Sergeants (Metropolitan Police) and Sub-inspectors.45. We [understand that the question of abolishing the rank of Station Sergeant in the Metropolitan Police is under consideration. If a rank intermediate between Section Sergeant and Inspector, with duties superior to those of sergeants generally, is retained (whether under the present or some other designation), we recommend that the scale of pay should he 115.?. rising by two annual increments of 2.?. 6d. to 120s. In a few provincial forces there is a rank of Sub-Inspector between the ranks, of Sergeant and Inspector. We have not received any evidence specially dealing with this rank, but it seems to us desirable that, if possible, it should be merged into one of the other ranks. If it is necessary to retain it, we consider the scale of pay which, we have,recommended for Station Sergeants in the Metropolitan Police would be suitable.Pay of the Higher Ranks. .&apos;- . )46. TheNpay of the higher ranks varied before the war, and still varies, from one force to another no less than the pay of the constables and sergeants. For example, before the war a uniform Inspector in the Metropolitan Police was on the scale  171 12s. rising to  192 8s.; an Inspector in one or two provincial forces received only  90 rising to  110, while in.other forces the scale was  130 rising to  170, with a house rent free. These rates have been increased during the war. The pensionable pay of a Metropolitan Inspector is now  205* 8s. rising to  226 4s., while the provincial rates vary from the Metropolitan rate or thereabouts to  160 rising to  180, and the war bonuses and children&apos;s allowances are generally the same as apply to the lower ranks. &apos;47. We consider that the pay of the higher ranks should he increased, though not neces-sarily in the same arithmetical proportion as the pay of the lower ranks; but we are not prepared to recommend a single standard scale for all forces, one reason being, that the duties performed by officers in the same nominal rank are not standardised as between one force and another. For instance, in some county forces&apos;there are no Inspectors, their place being taken by Superintendents, and in others, where both ranks exist, an officer designated &quot;Superintendent&quot; in one Division may be doing the same work as an &quot;Inspector&quot; in another. And even in forces where the organisation is on similar lines, the responsibilities of the individual officers and the number of men under their command vary to a material degree from one force to another. For example, the responsibilities of an Inspector in one of the small Borough forces which exist at present, with a total strength of only 15 or 20 men, are much less than those of an Inspector in the Metropolitan Police or any large City Force, and the responsibilities of officers in the busy industrial County Forces are heavier than in the rural and sparsely populated counties. In these circumstances,our remarks regarding the general equality of the services&apos; rendered by the sergeants and constables throughout the&quot; country do not apply in the same degree to the higher ranks, and we do not think a standard scale of pay could be applied equitably to the latter.* Subject to the provision for special advance in the scale as stated in paragraph 40. 23873 B 241.

48. We are satisfied, however, that the pay of the higher ranks should be brought more into accord with the services rendered, and we recommend :-(a) That the scales of pay of all ranks should be subject to the approval of the HomeOffice or the Scottish Office, as the case may be, with the object of securing that officers performing work of similar responsibility are remunerated, so far as possible, at similar rates.(b) For this purpose, steps should be taken by the Home Office and the Scottish Office toassimilate, through H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, the organisation of the various ranks in the provincial forces so as to secure that, so far as possible, similar work is performed by corresponding ranks in forces where the nature of the work is similar.(c) That all scales of pay should follow the general lines indicated in paragraph 49 asto the minimum and maximum rates, increments, &amp;c.(d) That in forces where it is necessary to readjust the work of the various ranks, any immediate increase of pay granted in (pursuance of our Report should be pro-visional and subject to reconsideration as readjustment of the duties of the ranks proceeds.49., On the assumption that the duties of the various ranks are brought into general accord with the normal standard, we suggest that the scales of pay should be framed on the following general lines: Inspectors. The scale should commence at not less than  310 and not more than  325 per annum, and should rise by increments of  7 10s. or  10 for four or five years.Sub-Divisional Inspectors (Metropolitan Police oikly).-The scale should start at  .15 above the maximum for Inspectors and rise by three annual increments of  10.Chief Inspectors. The commencing pay of the Chief Inspector, where the rank exists, should be  .15 or  20 above the maximum of the Inspector (in the Metropolitan Police, the Sub-Divisional Inspector), and should rise by annual increments of not less than  10 or more than  15 for four years.Superintendents -The minimum pay of the Superintendents should be not less than  20 above that of the maximum of the Inspector or Chief Inspector, as the case may be, and should rise by annual increments of&apos;not less than  15 or more than  25 for four, five or six years.Chief Superintendentso-r-The scale should start at  20 above the maximum of the scale for ^Superintendents and rise by annual increments of  20 or  25 for two or three years.50. The scales applicable in any particular force will depend on whether the force is a County or Borough force, on the arrangement of the ranks and their strengths and on the nature of the work and the responsibilities of the officers in the particular force.. In the following table we give specimen scales for (a), the Metropolitan Police, (6) one of the largest County or Borough forces, (c) a Borough force of intermediate size, (d) a County force of a rural County, and (e) a Borough Police with no higher rank than that of Inspector. These scales, however, are given merely by way of illustrating the application of the above recommendations to various types of Police force, and in each ease, including; Scale A. the figures are subject to any readjustments which may be carried out in the designations and duties of the ranks.

We consider that for Chief Constables in the Metropolitan Police a suitable scale would be  800 rising to  .1,000 per annum.-Increase, of Pay to be Retrospective. *57. We recommend that the pay of all ranks be revised in accordance with our recom-mendations, with retrospective effect as from 1st April, 19.191, and that in the case of men who have retired on pension since that date&apos; the pension should be reassessed1. We have had much evidence from the men as to their present financial difficulties, and1 we therefore recommend that, pending the revision of the scales of pay, some advance on&apos; account should be made to the men with the least possible delay.Meth.0. i of Standardisation.,58. We consider that the Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland: should have power jointly to- fix the standard! scale of pensionable pay for sergeants and constables, and that the standard should be reviewed from time to time, but that any change&apos; should only be made- after opportunity has been afforded to the Police Authorities, Chief Constables and. other ranks of the: Police to submit their representations by daily authorised means-, such,&apos;; for instance, as we suggest in paragraph 82.59. The Secretary of State or the Secretary for Scotland should have power to withhold the whole or any part of the grant from the Exchequer Contribution account or any other con-tribution from Imperial Funds to the Police- Fund; or the Pension&apos; Fund of any force, if the Police Authority does not comply with the requirements, for the time being with regard to the pay of the force or any other prescribed conditions or if the Secretary of State or the Secretary for Scotland should be satisfied, on the Report of HIM. Inspector of Constabulary or otherwise, that the force is not efficient or efficiently controlled or managed in any respect. At present the only power the Secretary of State or the Secretary for Scotland has with regard to the jrant from the Exchequer Contribution account is to withhold the certificate of efficiency oh a definite report by the Inspector,.of-Constabulary that either the force has not been maintained in a state of efficiency in point of- numbers or discipline or the management and efficiency of the force have not been satisfactory, and; thereby to suspend&apos;the payment of the whole grant to the Police Fund or the Pension Fund,., a measure which naturally would only be taken in a very extreme case.War Bonus and Children^ Allowances..60*. . Our recommendations with regard&quot;; to the scales of pay of the various- ranks have been based&apos; on general considerations of the status and duties of the Police Service, and we consider that the- whole of the rates of pay which we recommend&apos; should! be pensionable, and1 all existing war bonuses should be abolished when the new scales become effective.61. An allowance for children is granted now in most forces by way of an additional war bonus to meet in some degree the extra expenses of a policeman who has a family to52. All the above scales of pay are based on the assumption that a house or quarters are provided rent free or an allowance is given in lieu as provided in para.. 64, but they should include any good conduct, proficiency, or long service allowances which may be paid at present.Pay of Ohief Constables.(.1) County and Borough Police.53. it appears from the returns of pay which we have received that, whereas some Chief Constables have received substantial advances by way of pay or bonus during the war, a number of them, including some in command of important County and Borough forces, have received no increase of pay whatever, while others have received only a small amount, More-over, the pre-war salaries appear to have been&apos;fixed with little or no regard to the salaries paid to other Chief Constables in command of forces of about the same strength and with similar responsibilities; and we consider that the salaries of Chief Constables require revision no less than those of the ranks under their command, and should also be subject to the approval of the Home Office, or the Scottish Office, as the case may be.54. We do not think it possible to fix the salaries of Chief Constables, even Chief Con-stables of the Borough forces, merely on a basis of strength of force and/or population, partly because of the considerable variations in the strength of the forces in towns of about the same size, and to fix the salaries, of County Chief Constables on any such hard-and-fast rule would be even less appropriate.55. We think, however, it is possible to lay down certain minimum limits for the salaries&apos; of Chief Constables; and, subject to any recommendations we may have to make as to the future of the small Borough forces, we recommend that the pay of Chief Constables of the smallest forces, for example, a force with 10 or 15 constables and sergeants and no higher rank, should not be less than  350 per annum, and that the salaries of Chief- Constables on appointment in the larger Borough forces should not be lower than the general level indicated in the following table:  Salary on Appointment.
support. Generally the amount is 2s, M. weekly for each child under school age. In some forces no special children&apos;s allowance is paid, but both married and single men receive an addition to the war bonus over and above the amounts usually paid in forces where a separate allowance for children is given.62. As to the retention of the children&apos;s allowances, we found a considerable difference of opinion among the representatives of the men. Some of them appreciated the allowances and favoured their retention, but others urged that a policeman, like other people, should be paid according to his work, and independently of the size of his family. One objectionable con-sequence of the allowance is that a Sergeant or Inspector with no children may receive several shillings less per week than a man of lower rank if the latter draws an allowance for several children. In view of our recommendations with regard to the increase of pay and improved housing arrangements we recommend the abolition of the children&apos;s allowances with the other bonuses.Housing and Rent Aid.63. As regards housing and rent aid, there is at present a great diversity of practice between one force and another. Thus in many City and Borough forces only a few men, if any, live in police quarters, while the rest find their own houses or lodgings and receive no rent aid. In the Metropolitan Police the single men are provided with accommodation in Section Houses, for which they pay Is. per week; the married men find their own houses and receive rent aid at rates varying between Is. Qd. and 2s. Qd. weekly, according to the part of the Metropolitan Police District in which the man lives. In a good many County forces most members of the force are accommodated rent free in police stations or houses owned or rented by the Police Authority, and any men for whom such accommodation is not available receive allowances in lieu. In some County forces, accommodation is provided but a small charge is made, while in others many of the men find their own quarters, but each receives by way of rent allowance the amount by which his rent exceeds an amount fixed by the Police Authority. It is: obvious that by reason of these diversities constables in one force may be better off than those in another force though the latter may be nominally on a higher rate of pay or bonus.64. In order to give effect to our conclusions with regard to the standardisation of the pay of the Police it is essential that housing conditions should be assimilated. We understand that the policy of building or buying houses for all members of the force is being increasingly adopted by County Police Authorities. We favour the extension of this policy wherever possible and the renting of houses by the Police Authority in other cases. We recommend that men who are provided with quarters in police stations, section houses, &amp;c, should live rent free; that all ranks should either be provided with houses rent free, or, if they find their own houses or lodgings, should receive a non-pensionable allowance in lieu. This allowance should either cover the rent paid by the individual constable, not exceeding a maximum limit to be fixed for the single and married men of each rank respectively for the police area as a whole, or for a town or particular part of a town; or should be a flat rate allowance for the single and married men of each rank respectively, applying throughout the police area, or to a town or part of a town (if rents vary materially within the police area), and fixed on the basis of an average reasonable rent for a policeman to pay according to his rank and the locality in question. Houses should in all cases be subject to the approval of the Police Authority, and for the purpose of settling the allowances &quot; rent&quot; should be calculated, so as to include rates and taxes. We think, however, that the provision of houses or an allowance in lieu should apply only to constables whose appointment to the force has been confirmed, and not to those on probation. Men on probation should either find their own accommodation or, if accommodated in section houses or other police quarters, should pay an appropriate charge for the accommodation. The coal allowance at present paid in the Metropolitan Police and any similar allowances paid; elsewhere to men not occupying police quarters should be abolished. ;65. It has been suggested that when new houses are being built their main dimensions should be the same throughout the police area, so that when a constable is transferred from one place to another the principal articles of furniture may serve equally well in the house to which he goes as in the one he left, and this seems to us a desirable arrangement. The Home Office and the Scottish Office: should exercise general sxipervision over schemes for new police stations and housing arrangements for the police, not only as to the. construction of the cells in the police stations but also as to the general suitability of the housing accommodation it is pi*oposed to provide.Local Allowances. -66. If the wide differences in the rent at present.paid by the police in different forces, are removed as we suggest, we do not think there will be any occasion for a general system of looal allowances to meet local variations in the..,cost of living. Some witnesses have suggested in general terms that such allowances should be given, but without adducing&apos; any special reasons for differentiating in favour of particular localities, and the evidence of other witnesses suggests serious difficulties in differentiating between forces on these grounds. We have come to the conclusion that such differences in the prices of foodstuffs&apos; and other articles entering into a policeman&apos;s household expenditure as may exist at present as between one-locality and another are too uncertain in every way to form a basis for any general, differentiation between the remuneration of the police in one force and another.
* Dunning, 1493.Boot Allowance.67. We recommend that the allowance for boots should be fixed by the Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland at&quot; a standard rate for all forces, and should be non-pensionable, The amount should be subject to review if prices should materially alter in either direction. We consider that a reasonable amount at present would be Is. (kl. weekly.Hours of Duty.68. It has always been the accepted theory that the whole time of a policeman is at the disposal of the Police Service,* and the conditions which a constable accepts on appointment generally, if not universally, include a specific provision to this effect. &apos; The typical duty of the town policeman is beat duty of 8 hours broken by a period for rest and refreshment. The country policeman has to do any police duty which is called for at any time and in any part of his beat and in the absence of any matter calling for his special attention to do so much patrol duty. It is impossible for the country policeman to work to fixed hours of duty in the same degree as a town policeman; but on the other hand he has some advantages, inasmuch as he is on duty as soon as he steps out of his door, whereas the town policeman has to spend some time in travelling to and from the police station and parading for instructions. The normal 8-hour day has now been adopted in the Metropolitan Police and in most, if not. all, City and Borough Police Forces. Until recently the normal day in the County Police was one of 9 hours, but the 8-hour day has now been adopted in some of the counties, and-we-&apos;recommend its adoption generally throughout the Police Service, subject, of course, ,to- file&apos;, exigencies of duty. We recognise that certain police duties, more particularly detectiye work and County Police work generally, cannot be worked to fixed and limited hours.Payment for Overtime.69. Until comparatively recently the only method of compensating a policeman for extra duty entailed in an emergency was to allow him &quot;time off?Von another occasion, but for some years payments have been made for overtime worked in some forces. Many of the representatives of the men have urged that they should receive payment for -extra hours worked (apart from occasions when they have been detained to complete some matter in hand), the payment to be at the rate of one and a half times the normal rate of pay, or double the normal rate fox duty on a weekly rest day or bank holiday. In our opinion the question of payment for overtime in the case of a policeman cannot be considered on the same basis as in the case of an ordinary industrial worker who is paid a fixed amount for so much work, measured either by the time occupied or the amount of the product, and we have taken this, among other circumstances of the policeman&apos;s calling, into account in fixing the scales of pay which we have recommended. While we do not consider that a policeman should he entitled to any extra payment because he is merely detained beyond his normal hours to complete some matter in hand, we do think that when it is necessary to extend the normal hours of duty by more than a complete hour or to call upon a constable to do duty outside his normal hours &quot; time off&quot; should be given from some other tour of duty, if the exigencies of the service permit. The &quot;time off&quot; should be equal to the time lost, and allowed when it will give the constable the full benefit. &quot; Time off &quot; for constantly recurring occasions of overtime might be dealt with by a standard allowance, based on the average time occupied by the duties. If, however, &quot; time off &quot; cannot be given within a reasonable period, sergeants and constables should; be paid for the additional duty by an hourly non-pensionable allowance, representing as nearly as possible the&quot; average pay of the rank, for each completed hour of duty over eight hours. The hourly rate should be calculated on the basis of a week of 7 days and a day of 8 hours. The above recommendations apply equally to addi-tional hours worked on a weekly rest day, Sunday or a public holiday, as to any other occasion. Where the extra duties entail extra expense for meals, such expenses should be met by a special payment by way of a refreshment or subsistence allowance.70. Where constables are engaged on what is known as detachment duty, i.e., when they are lent in aid of another police force, Ave do not consider payment should be made according to the extra hours worked but that a consolidated daily allowance should be fixed in consideration of the special circumstances in which the duty is performed and a separate subsistence allowance paid if food and lodging are not provided by the aided Police Authority.-Subsistence Allowances.71. The subsistence allowance, which is granted to meet special expenses caused by absence from home which pre Agents- the man getting his meals in the ordinary course or necessitates payment for lodging, should cover the average actual expenses which a constable may reason-ably have to incur, and enable him to resort to places of accommodation suitable to his status and uniform. It appears from the evidence of a number of police witnesses and from the returns which we have received that the present rates of subsistence allowance in many forces are quite inadequate in view of the present level of prices. We consider that the scales should be revised on the basis we suggest.Detective, or Criminal Investigation Department Allowances.72. In the Metropolitan Police and ,the Liverpool City Police higher scales of pensionable pay are assigned to the respective ranks of the Criminal Investigation Department than to the corresponding ranks in the Uniform Branch; while in other forces men in the Detective Branch receive an allowance, which is generally but not always non-pensionable, in consideration 02
the casual expenses incidental to detective work, small rewards which have to be paid for information, irregular hours of duty and expenses of meals caused by unexpected absence from home. They generally receive in addition to the detective allowance a plain clothes allowance, paid to ali men on plain clothes duty. In other forces, including&apos; many County forces, no separate Detective Branch exists, and the men receive no special allowance in consideration of the detective work they do. The witnesses from the London and Liverpool Criminal Investi-gation Departments claimed that the nature of their work entitled them to higher pay than the Uniform Branch, but the representatives from the Uniform Branch did not generally admit this claim, and most Chief Constables who gave evidence were opposed to differential rates. One objection which was mentioned was the difficulty which is created by the prospective loss of pensionable pay on the transfer of a man from the Detective Branch to the Uniform Branch if he is found unsuitable for detective work.73. We are satisfied that detective work calls for some extra remuneration, bi.it we consider that a case has not been made out for a higher rate of pensionable pay. It is to be remembered that the proportions of higher to lower ranks is greater among men regularly engaged on detective duty than is the case with men engaged in other duties, and this in itself creates an advantage in favour of the former. Further, we see no objection to an officer receiving the grant of a.special increment in the scale of pay of his rank after some probationary period in the Detective Branch. In this case, even if he is subsequently transferred back to the Uniform Branch, the effect, if any, on his pensionable pay would be merely temporary.74. The amount of the detective allowance should cover the ordinary casual expenses incidental to detective work, but we do not suggest that the grant of it should preclude the refund of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in special circumstances. The detective allowances at present paid vary from force to force. AVe do not think the allowance is capable of standardisation at a single rate, because the expenses are not the same in all forces, but the rates should be subject to approval by the Home Office or the Scottish Office.Plain Clothes Allowance.75. The plain clothes allowance which is generally paid to officers who do duty in plain clothes instead of in the uniform with which men on ordinary duty are provided, should be measured to cover the extra cost caused by their having to clothe themselves when they are on duty as well as when off duty. It should not be measured merely by the amount saved by the Police Authority by not providing uniform. We think the allowance should be fixed and paid on a weekly basis, as: is the general practice at present. We do not suggest a standard rate as the cost of the necessary plain clothes may vary from force to force according to the duties to be performed and according to the current cost of clothing generally, but we consider-that 7.s&apos;. for Superintendents and Inspectors and 5*. for sergeants and constables would, as a rule, be a reasonable allowance in consideration of the duty done in plain clothes for a full week.Bicycle Allowance.76. This is an allowance generally paid where bicycles are regularly used on police duty and are not provided by the Police Authority. The amount should be measured to meet the annual or weekly upkeep of a policeman!s bicycle, so far as it may be used on police duty. The-basis of payment and the amounts vary. In some cases the amount is. based on mileage at the rate of Id., Ihd. or 2d. per mile, and in others it is a fixed, weekly or annual allowance, generally at a rate of from  3 to  5 per year. The cost of upkeep will vary from, force to force according to the extent to which bicycles are used and the condition of the roads. We are not prepared to recommend a standard allowance, but the rates should be subject to approval by the Home Office or the Scottish Office. -Pension Scale. ,/. 77. The pensions of the Police Forces in England and Wales (with the exception of the City of London Force, which has a pension scale of its own under the City of London Police Superannuation Act, 1889) are regulated by the Police Act, 1890, and amending Acts. Under these Acts the scale of pensions is to some extent at the discretion of the Local Police Authority, but only within narrow limits. Most Police Authorities have adopted the maximum scale which the Acts allow, but some of them, under pressure&apos; of the rapidly-growing deficiency in the pension funds, have adopted,,lower scales for the men joining the force after the change. Apart from the special pensions for men who are incapacitated hj injuries received in the execution of their duty and the -pensions to which men with over .15 years&apos; service are entitled on retirement with a medical.certificate, any constable can retire after 25 years with a pension which, under the maximum scale, will be 3.1/50ths of his annual pay at retirement and after 26 years&apos; service can retire with a pension of 2/3rds of his pay. Under the minimum scale, the pension at 25 years&apos; service would be one-half of the pay, and the constable would have to serve 35 years to retire on 2/3rds of his pay.. A Police Authority may fix.an age limit before which a constable shall not be entitled to retire on pension without a medical certificate. This age limit must not be less than 50 nor more than 55 in the case of constables and sergeants, and not more than 60. for the higher ranks. Age limits have been fixed and are still in operation in some County and Borough forces.. In Scotland, the pension scheme laid down in the Police &quot;(Scotland) Act, 1890, differs materially from that of the English Police and is distinctly less favourable to the men. hi-the first place, an age limit of 55 for constables and sergeants and&apos;60 for higher ranks is fixed by the Act for all forces: the pension to which a constable is entitled after 25 years&apos;&apos;
service is fixed tit 5/12ths of his pay, as against the 3.1/50ths allowed by the English Act and adopted for most English forces, and he has to serve for 34 years before retiring (with-out medical certificate) on the maximum pension of 2/3rds. - There are other minor differences to the disadvantage of the Scottish Police.78. In order to give effect to the principle of standardisation which we have adopted, we consider it essential that the pensions of the Police should be standardised and, in particular, that a single scale of pensions on retirement without medical certificate should be fixed to apply to the Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police and all County and Borough Police forces in Great Britain. We recommend a scale&apos;on the following basis:-All ranks should be entitled on retirement without medical certificate after 25 years&apos; approved service to receive a pension for life at the rate of one-half the annual pensionable pay at the date of retirement; after 30 years&apos; approved service the pension should be at the maximum rate of 2/8rds of the pay at retirement; and for intermediate periods of service between 25 and .30 years die pension should be at intermediate rates. This scale should not apply to men now serving in forces where the pension scale is more favourable, but we recommend that men serving in other forces should be given the option of accepting it in lieu of their present scale and that it should be applied in all forces to all new entrants to the Police Service.79.^ We have included in this Report our recommendation with regard to a standard scale of pensions on retirement without a medical certificate, because of its importance in the scheme of standardisation of conditions throughout the Police Service. We propose to deal in the Second Part of our Report with the other questions relating to pensions which have been raised in the course of our inquiry.National Representative Body for the Police.80. It appears to us that if&quot; the pensionable pay and various other conditions are to be fixed for the Police Service as a whole, as we consider they should be, it is essential that means should be provided at the same time to enable the Police, as well as. the Police Authorities, to submit their views through their chosen representatives to the Central Authority with regard to any changes of pay or other matters affecting the Service as a whole.81. Several arrangements for this purpose have been suggested to us in general terms,;* for example, that an independent Standing Committee should be set up to hear and report upon any matters relating to pay, conditions of service, &amp;c, which the Police or Police Authorities may wish to submit, or that a National Council should be formed, consisting of representatives chosen from the various ranks,1 to discuss such questions and to bring their suggestions before the Central Authority.82. It appears to us that any system for this purpose should provide for (a) a local representative body for the ranks of Inspector, Sergeant and Constable in each force. In the case of the smaller forces this body might consist of all the members of the rank, and the representatives of the various, ranks might, by agreement, meet together to discuss matters affecting the force as a whole; (b) a Conference of representatives from each of the three ranks, meetingperhaps once a year, each force to be represented; (c) a Central Committee or Council consisting of representatives of the Metropolitan Police, County Police and Borough Police in equal proportions, elected by the Conference of representatives from among their number. This Central Committee or Council might&apos; meet with representatives of the Chief Constables, Superintendents and Police Authorities on the basis of a round table conference presided over by a representative of the Home Office to consider questions affecting the Police Service of England and Wales as a whole. Whether the suggested Council should be representative of all forces in Great Britain, or whether a separate Council should be formed for Scotland, will be a matter for consideration; but as we recommend a standard scale of pay for the lower ranks throughout Great Britain, it seems desirable that the Central Council should be representative of the whole of Great Britain, at any rate when any alteration of the standard scale is in question. So far as the Police are concerned, such a repre-sentative system should, in our opinion, be confined to serving members of the Police. &apos; Questions of discipline and promotion, except questions of general principle, should be excluded from its scope.Exchequer Contributions.83. At present the subsidies from Imperial Funds for the County and Borough Police of England and Wales are of three kinds: (a) a contribution under the Local Government Act, 1888, whereby one half the cost of the pay and clothing for each force is chargeable to the assigned revenues which are carried to the Exchequer Contribution account for the County or County Borough; (b) contributions to the several Pension Funds made through the Local Government Board under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890; and (c) the direct-supplementary grant from Imperial funds made for the first time last year through the Home Office.84. The subsidies towards thecost of the Metropolitan Police consist of (a) a contribution out of the Exchequer Contribution account of an amount approximately equivalent to a rate of id. in the  , (b) a contribution towards the Pension Fund similar to (6) above, the amount being , 150,000: per annum, (c) a direct grant of  100,000 per annum in respect of services of ah Imperial and national character, and (d) the direct supplementary grant instituted last year.&apos;* Da&apos;e and McBimey, 2206-2276;  Dalton and Holm3*, 28.M-2861 ; Sinclair, 6198 ; Johnstone, 7518-9 McNab, 7628-9.23873 - 0
IS85. The subsidies lor the County and Burgh Police in Scotland consist of (a) a contribu-tion of a fixed sum (at present &quot; 220,000 per annum) distributed by the Secretary for Scotland among the Police Authorities according to the expenditure in the respective forces and (b) the direct supplementary grant instituted last year.8G. Though the direct supplementary grants are based on the amount necessary to cover, with the other subsidies, half the net cost of the Police including the cost of pensions, the grant does not in practice under present arrangements relieve the rates of the full half of any increase in police expenditure. This arises from the fact that (a) one half the cost of pay and clothing has by Statute to be charged to&apos;the Exchequer Contribution account, which does not increase with Police expenditure and may diminish, so that any extra charge upon it in respect of Police expenditure cannot be met except by diminishing any surplus which would otherwise have been available for other local purposes in relief of the rates, and (b) according to the decision of the Treasury, the supplementary grant is based each year on. the previous year&apos;s expenditure, so that while the expenditure is rising the rates bear more than half of any increase.87. Prior to the outbreak of war it had been proposed, as part of a scheme for re-organisa-tion of the grants in aid of local taxation, to substitute for the present complicated system a direct Government grant towards the cost of the Police including pensions of an amount equal to one-half the total net expenditure. This scheme was embodied in the Local Taxation Bill of 1914, but was not proceeded with owing to the outbreak of war.88. It is obvious that the increased scales of pay which we recommend will considerably increase the burden on the Police Funds and the Police Pension -Funds. Our view of the relations of the Police Forces to the Central Government and the Local Authorities leads us to recommend that the direct supplementary grant should be increased as from and including the financial year .1918-19 so as to cover at least one-half of the cost of the Police, including the cost of pensions, without any additional charge being thrown on the Exchequer Contribution account by reason of the increase in the cost of pay and clothing, and that this direct grant should be calculated in each year on the expenditure of that year instead of on the expenditure of the previous year.Summary of Principal Recommendations.Our more important conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows:  (1) The general Police system to be maintained on the present lines, but a greater degree standardisation is. desirable as regards pay, allowances, pensions and conditions of service generally.   (Paragraphs 17-18.)(2) A standard scale of pensionable pay to be fixed for constables and sergeants throughout Great Britain.   (Paragraphs .19-23.)(3) The standard scale of pay for constables to commence at 70.?. weekly, rising by annual increments of 2.v. to 90*. weekly, with two further long service increments of 2s. 6(7. weekly after seventeen and twenty-two years&apos; service, subject to good conduct and efficiency. Constables to be eligible after five years&apos; service to receive a special advance of two increments in the scale for good conduct and special proficiency, subject to passing the qualifying examination for promotion.   (Paragraphs 39-42.)(4) The standard scale of pay for. section sergeants to be .100*. weekly on promotion, rising by five annual increments of 2*. Qd. to 1.12*. Gd. weekly.   (Paragraph 43.)(5) The scales of pay of the higher, ranks to be increased and subject to the approval of the Home Office or the Scottish Office, as the case may be, with the object of securing that so far as possible officers performing work of similar responsibility are remunerated at similar rates.      (Paragraph 46-56.)(6) The increases of pay to be retrospective as from 1st April, .19.19.   (Paragraph 57.)(7) The Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland to have power jointly to fix the standard scale of pensionable pay for sergeants and constables, the standard - to be subject to review from time to time, but any change only to be made&apos; after opportunity has been afforded to the Police Authorities, Chief Constables and other ranks to submit their views by duly authorised means.   (Paragraph 58.)(8) Any war bonus and children&apos;s allowances paid at present to be abolished when the increased scales of pensionable pay become effective.   (Paragraphs 60-62.)(9) Houses or quarters to be provided rent free for all ranks (except constables on pro-nation ) or non-pensionable allowances given in lieu.   (Paragraphs 63-64.)(10) The boot allowance? to be standardised for ail forces, the rate at present to be .1*. Qd. weekly.   (Paragraph 67.)(.11) A normal eight-hour day to be adopted throughout the Police Service. (Para-graph 68.)(.12) Compensation for extended hours of duty to be given where possible by way of &quot;time off.&quot; If &quot;time off&quot; cannot be given, sergeants and constables be paid for overtime (apart from extra Avork merely to complete some matter in hand) by a non-pensionable allowance at an hourly rate representing as nearly as possible the average pay of the rank for each completed hour of duty over 8 hours. (Paragraphs 69-70.)(13) All ranks in the Criminal Investigation Department or Detective Branch to have the same scale of pensionable pay as corresponding ranks in the Uniform Branch, hut to receive non-pensionable detective and plain clothes allowances. (Paragraphs 72-74.)
(14) A single scale of pensions on retirement without medical certificate to be fixed for all forces in Great Britain, on the following basis: All ranks to be entitled after 25 years&apos; approved service to a pension at the rate of one half the annual pension-able pay at the date of retirement, and after 30 years&apos; approved service to a pension at the rate of two-thirds of the pay with intermediate rates of pension for inter-mediate periods of service. This scale to be optional in the case of men now serving and applied to all new entrants to the Police Service, but not to serving-members of a Force with a scale which is more favourable. . (Paragraphs 77-78.)(15) A National Representative Body to be formed for the Police.   (Paragraphs 80-82.)(16) The direct supplementary grant from Imperial Funds which was instituted last year to he increased as from and including the financial year 1918-19, so as to cover at least one-half of the cost of the Police, including the cost of pensions, without any additional charge being thrown on the Exchequer Contribution account by reason of the increase in the cost of pay and clothing, and this direct grant to be calculated in each year on the expenditure of that year instead of on the expenditure of the previous year.    (Paragraphs 83-88.)The following are some of the more important questions which have been raised in the course of our inquiry and with which we propose to deal in the Second Part of our Report: recruiting and Training, Discipline, Promotion, Leave, Medical Arrangements, various questions relating to Pensions, Grouping of Police Authorities for purposes of control, and the merging of tin smaller Borough Forces in the County Forces.We desire most emphatically to express our sense of the deep obligation we are under to our Secretary, Mr. A. L. Dixon, C.B.E., without whose untiring industry and conspicuous ability it would have been impossible for us to have issued this Part of our Report within the limits of the time at our disposal.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,DESBOROUGH.
