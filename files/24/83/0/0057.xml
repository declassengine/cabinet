WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.In view of the existence of a general idea that there is extravagance in the Royal Air Force, and that the administration has not taken sufficiently drastic steps towards a reduction in expenditure, I wish to bring to your notice the following facts which show how erroneous this idea is :--Personnel.Demobilization. After the Armistice, as soon as demobilization was authorized, this was proceeded with as fast as practicable, and up to date approximately 17,000 officers and 207,000 men have been demobilized of the 28,000 officers and 264,000 men serving in the Royal Air Force at the date of the Armistice. Demobilization of other &quot; ranks has, in fact, proceeded so fast that I am in serious difficulties as to finding personnel of suitable categories to provide drafts for the Rhine Air Force and the units required for military operations in other spheres of war including the Indian frontier.The number of officers actually disposed of would by now have been much greater but for the following facts : Up to the end of February no officer had been demobilized who had not specially asked to go, in accordance with a decision of the Judge-Advocate that demobilization was not compulsory until the end of the war. At the end of February this decision was reversed, and Under-Secretary of State approved of demobilization of officers subject to 28 days&apos; notice reduced to 14 days&apos; notice as from 15th May. The daily number demobilized is limited to 300 to 400 by the inability of the agents to handle more than this number of accounts.With nearly 200 air stations and detachments being closed down it was necessary to retain a large number of technical and other officers to deal with stores, and these officers could not be released until their accounts were passed.Approximately 4,000 officers, applicants for permanent commissions in the Royal Air Force, had to be retained pending decision as regards the future strength of the Royal Air Force in time of peace.Repatriation and return to units. A large number of officers and cadets had to be retained while awaiting allocation of shipping for repatriation. These required accommodation and care as regards their discipline, to attend to which other officers and men had to be kept back from demobilization.Further delay was caused in returning to the Army officers awaiting decision by War Office as to return to their own units.Service overseas. In addition, owing to post-Armistice operations in various countries, and difficulties in shipping facilities, there has been an excess of 1,000 officers with units overseas.Reduction of staff in Chief of the Air Staffs Department, Air Ministry. On ths 11th November, 1918, the staff in my Department consisted of 495 officers. It now consists of 215.Credit has not been taken, of course, for those branches that have been transferred from my Department, even though they have been considerably reduced.The number of clerks also has been reduced in my Department from 998 to 598.(B19/311)  70  7/19  HAS  7301 wo
It is not sufficiently appreciated that discharge of personnel by no means ends the work attaching to demobilization there is a large amount of clearing up to lie done in the way of records, pay, &amp;c., and staff especially clerical staff has to be retained for this. The reduction in staff is greater, proportionately, than the reduction in work at the Air Ministry,In one or two of my smaller sub-departments, reductions have been almost too drastic, and this has interfered with efficiency.: It must be remembered that the Department of the Chief of the Air Staff, in addition to administration, demobilization, &amp;c., is also charged with the responsible and arduous work of organizing and building up of a new Service the Post-war Air Force; it is short-handed, and lacks a sufficiency of capable Staff officers, and other experienced personnel.MatjSbiel Mechanical Transport, &amp;c.Disposal of surplus machines, engines and transport. Several hundred aircraft and more than 500 aircraft engines have actually been turned over to the Disposal Board who have, in addition, ,been notified that very much larger numbers are available for disposal.Obsolete aircraft have been dismantled, and their produce value amounts to nearly 20,000/.Over 500 motor transport vehicles have been notified to the Disposal Board for disposal, and a farther number will be sent when the Disposal Board can take them.Cancellation of contracts. Approximately 200 contracts for new marine craft have been cancelled, and the Disposal Board have been notified of 140 vessels for disposal.Running economies. With regard to running economy all flying not essential, including instruction, was discontinued immediately after the Armistice entailing a saving of petrol and oil of 1,000,000 gallons and 350,000 gallons per month respectively.The following surplus quantities of petrol and oil will probably be available shortly for disposal: Petrol      ......      ......   9,500,000 gallons.Oil...............   1,600,000of which the market value is approximately 1,778,500/.The use of motor transport has been cut down to a minimum. For instance, the number of motor cars in use. on the 11th November, 1918, by the Air Council, Air Ministry and outside Departments was : Allotted cars    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   33Pool      ......      ...............35This number has now been reduced to Allotted cars (members of Council)    ...      ...      ...     6Pool      .....................18Lands and B gildings.Hired premises relinquished. 478 hired premises are either relinquished or in process of being relinquished, causing a reduction in rent of approximately 400,000/. per annum.In addition, by prompt relinquishment to owners, it has been possible, in several cases, to reduce, or to entirely eliminate, claims for delapidations. Owing, however, to the new procedure, by which all negotiations are undertaken by H.M. Office of Works, a certain amount of delay is now occasioned as regards relinquishments.Lands relinquished. In 40 cases, lands used as aerodromes, &amp;c, have been completely relinquished, and in 20 cases similar lands have been placed in the hands of the Lands Branch for disposal.118 landing grounds also have been relinquished.H.
