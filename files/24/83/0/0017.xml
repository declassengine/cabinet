HP50INCREASE  OF RAILWAY RATES,NOTE BY THIS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.I circulate, in accordance with the decision given in WAR CABINET Minute 587 (3) (d) of July 1st, copies of the following papers:-(1) Case for the opinion of.the Law Officers andMr. Branson, on the increase of Railway Rates etc;(2) Joint opinion.BOARD OF TRADE.A. C.   G E D D E S.July 4th, 1919.
IWJMjSBNJF-RAILTOT &quot;MEES &amp;CCASE  FOR THE  OPINION  OF THE .UT OFFICERS andMR. BRANSON.By Regulation 7 B of the Defence of the Realm Regulations it is provided that the Board of Trade may for the purposes of making the most efficient use of Railway plant or labour with a view to the successful px^ecuiion of the War make Orders for all or any of the purposes therein mentioned, and such purposes include- the power to make Orders for modifying any statutory re-, o^iiremerrts with respect to the maximum amount of passenger fares but there is no specific provision under this Regulation enabl-ing the Board of Trade to increase or authorise the increase of railway rates for goods.It has now been suggested that it would be advisable for the Board of Trade (if it is possible for them to do so) to take pow-er by Order to authorise an increase in the maxima^jrates for goods up to 50% in oxcess of the present maxima rates, but to enable this to be done it will be necessary, apart from legislation, for anoth-er Defence of the Realm Regulation to be made giving the Board of Trade power to do this, followed by an Order of the Board of Trade.The question, however is raised whether,, seeing that the orig-finally Regulation was made with a view (inter alia) TO THE SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF THE WAR (a mere variation of the language of section 1 of the defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act 1914, which de-clares that His Majesty in-Council, during tho continuance of the present War, has power to issue Regulations for securing TF.IE PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE DE7HNCB OF THE REALM) and having regard to the prtfmb
position of matters in respect of Peace it is possible legally to make a new Defence of the Realm Regulation authorising the making of such an Order of the Board of Trade,It should also be borne in mind that the increase of rates within the zm.&apos;mxim allowed would be subject to the appeal to the Railway h Canal Commission under the Railway &amp; Canal Traffic Act 1894, and if so there would be the somewhat anomalous position that increases of the rates within the maxima authorised by a Defence of the Realm Regulation or an Order thereunder (a breach of which would involve a person in a prosecution)) would be subject to an appeal to a Tribunal other than that set up by the Defence of the Realm Regulations.   There is a further point that under the Act of 1894 the complainant need only pay at the old rate, pending the decision of the Court.It has however been suggested that without going to the extent of making a new Defence of the Realm Regulation and an Order thereunder the Board of Trade might make an Order under Regulation 7 B (k) which might be of some use at the present juncture, but the same question arises as to whether, having regard to the present position of matters in respect of Peace the Board of Trade could now legally make such an Order,The matter is regarded as of very great importance, as the Cabinet are desirous of having the opinion of the Law Officers by Friday morning at a Cabinet Meeting, and a con-sultation and opinion given at the earliest possible moment would be greatly appreciated.THE LAW OFFICERS AND MR. E3ANS0N ARB REQUESTED
advise:(1) VJhether it would be legal, and if so till when, bo make a new Defence of the Realm Regulation empowering the Board of Trade by Order to authorise the charging of railway rates for - goods in excess of the prosent maxima (it is suggested that the increase should be up to 50% in excess of the present maxima) and for the Board of Trade to make such an Order under the new Regulation,(2) Aether it would be legal, and if so till when, for the Board of Trade to make an Order under Regulation 7 B (k) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations.(3) Aether an appeal from a Regulation and Order in respect of new rates so authorised would lie to the Railway &amp; Canal Commission or whether it would be possible or necessary to specifically negative such an appeal by the Regu-lation and/or the Order.
IBCRKASJE Of RAIMAY .JBASSS ETC.J 0 I ft T   OPU3IOI,THE Y&amp;R ie still to be treated as continuing (Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918)- and the power conferx-ed by the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act 1914 &quot;during the continuance of the presoct war to issue Regulations for securing the publio safety ana the defence &quot;of the Realm&quot; is still in existence and v.lll continue to exist until such date as may be fixed by Order in Council under the first named Act as the date of the termination of the present war.    Dut in order to be valid a regulation must be designed to secure the public safety and the defence of the Realm end it is not in our opinion possible to contend that such a regulation as that suggested could now le made with that object *    $e are, therefore, of opinion that the suggested regulation could not not? be legally made.No.    It is a condition precedent to the making of any order under Regulation 7 (b) that it must be made &quot;with a *View to the successful prosecution of the war&quot; and apart from that objection (which is in itself a fatal one) the language of Clause (k) does not authorise such an order as that suggested.Shis question becomes academic in view of our answers to 1 and 2.E.M.P. G.A.H.&amp;&amp;rd toy, 1919.
