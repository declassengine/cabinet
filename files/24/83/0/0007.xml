HOU2b OP -JilPLOYI^HT BILL.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a draft,, ;&apos;oi---t-he Hours of Employment Bill,It will be remembered that the Provisional Joint Committee of the national Industrial Conference, oomposcd of equal numbers of employers&apos; and worlancn, rocomraon&amp;od the early introduction of legislation fixing 48 JiOUAo as the   normal maximum working week for all employed persons.    Their report contained provisions allowing for variations of this maximum, or for total or partial exemption from, the Act, whether &quot;by agreement between representative- . &apos; organisations in a trade, confirmed by order of the Minister, or, where no agreement was reached, by order of the Minister after an^enquiry.     They expressly recognised that in exceptional cases lit might bo necessary to increase the maximum,   ,It was also recognised that in certain circumstances overtime might bo necessary, but systematic overtime was to bo discouraged;     It &quot;fas only to be allowed under the same procedure as laid down for variation of the maximum hours, i.e. by agreement or order, and whenever worked was to be paid for at a rate not less than 85^ in excess of the normal rate.     In addition to this, the Committee have proposed that no higher maximum than 48 shall be fixed, unless the Hinister has satisfied himself that wages arc so adjusted as to yield the equivalent of 25$, additional remuneration for the hours worked above 48.     This provision would open up endless prospects of controversy in   very case w&amp;ere a maximum higher than 40 had to be fixed e.g, in agriculture,       it would often be impossible for the Minister to Settle the points in dispute.     On those grounds I have not yet been able to see my way to meeting the Committee on this point..D G   OfActlus-The original draft Bill carrying out those recommendations confined the application of the ,-.ct to industrial workers only, The Committee, however, held strongly to the opinion that the Bill should apply to all employed persons, including persons employed under the Crown, though they agreed to the exception of domestic servants and seamen and persons in positions of supervision They pointed out that these wore amplo means for enabling any class to   secure exemption, if it were really necessary their or the public interest.The specific exclusion of Eailwaymen to which the Committee have n.it yet agreed, is due to the fact that from the nature of their employment they would have to be exempted, and they aie al:-early, covered by the agreement with the Board of Trade on which negotiations a:; e now proceeding.All industries and trades including agriculture are thus covered by the Bill:   In most of the great industries already-;-&apos;by agreement 48 hours or loss are being norkod, and other -classes of industries which are organised sufficiently, can take advantage of the provisions of the Act for   ^variation of the maximum and for the institution of necessary overtime by agrc-e-ment.      &quot;There organisation is inadequate, the Minister has power to grant exception on his own inti--ative or at the instance of any persons concerned.It is proposed (Clause 12)  hat the Act shall come into I?, operation automatically v/ithin six months from the date of   the passing, but the llinister may by order suspend the application of the Act for any class of cnnloymont for a further period not exceeding 6 months.
This should afford sui.fic.ient time for all classes of employment to adjust themselves to the now conditions Involved in the principle of the Bill., and to-make such application for e?:oomption as to *the conditions of their employment to make neoessary.- It is not/sasy to foresee the ef:&apos;ect of the Bill upon many miscellaneous occupations, but probably the oases whore a higher maximum than 40 hours is normally worked will rapidly grow less under the general pressure for a reduction of the hours -of work, and by the time the Aot beoomcs operative the inevitable dislocation should be reduced to a minimum, -(signed).
