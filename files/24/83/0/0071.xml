HThe past week has been a quiet one. It is difficult for the agitators to obtain listeners just before the holidays.The principle of direct action, which was adopted on a oard vote by the Triple Alliance, is by no means unanimously aooepted and much intrigue is going on behind the soenes.Opinion is ^lso divided regarding Nationalization of the Mines.  While the Lanarkshire miners regard State Management as impraotioable, the tide of publio opinion in the lower middle olass is beginning to run against the movement on the natural ground that it will enhance the price ox&apos; coal.   Bye-, elections are being fought at Bothwell and Swansea on the question of Nationalization.The standard causes of unrest remain unchanged and revolutionary feeling appears to be growing slowly in many districts,   Tiie high oost of living is causing real alarm.SUMMARYtm mum m&apos;M&apos;wUwim^iwwnW&apos;The/REPORT ON REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM  ...

INTERNATIONAL BOLSHEVIK ACTIVITIfig.Letters passing between M. JJSAN LONGUJ3T&apos;8 Seoretary,Miss SYLVIA PA^KHURST, and LUDWIG M&amp;RTBM8, the German leader of the Bolsheviks&apos;in America, have been intercepted. They show that, though LONOUET would probably not describe himself as a Bolshevik, he is keeping in touoh with the extreme element in this oountry and Ainerioa.    There is, however, evidenoe to show that Bolshevism is fast beooming an international Jewish movement, and as this aspect beoomea more marked it will provoke a storm of Antl-Semitio feeling.    U. LONGUET&apos;S secretary is sending artioles by ROBERT MINOR and PHILIPS PRICE to MARTENS to publish in America.The following extract from Miss SYLVIA PAMKHURST&apos;3oorrespondenoe is instructive:&quot;The cost of printing Is rising still.    Uot only &quot;that but printers do not oare to print us.    The &quot;few who are willing have too much work on hand. &quot;There are printing presses owned by other Labour &quot;organizations with their own work to do.    The &quot;dommeroial printer does not want to print us &quot;because he is afraid of devolution.    Only last &quot;week our printer gave us the saok beet-use his &quot;staff had begun to reply in letters to our paper &quot;to footnotes     - the printer - insisted on &quot;putting in our paper disclaiming our views.&quot;m mica.The forthcoming announcement of the reoommendations of Lord Desborough&apos;s Committee is likely to allay unrest in the various Polios Foroes.    In spite of the announce-mento made from time to time by the organisers, the Union has oertainly been losing ground and in the Provinoes the member ship appears to be dwindling.    i3ven in London, where large meetings were held in the Western, Southern and South-^Bastem Districts on July 4th and the audienoea pledged themselves not to accept the Government scheme and not to resign from the Union if oalled upon to do so,the/
the Union la certainly losing its hold., On the other hand, certain trade org&amp;nisations haveexpressed resentment against the Government, suoh as the %9 London Distriot Committee of the Engineering&amp; Ship-building tattdea Federation and the Boot &amp; Shoe Operatives in Leicester.    The extremists do not take the trouble to conceal their motives, which.are to have the Police on their side when future disturbances tiike, place.A strong attempt is being made to bring about a One-Day Strike, as a demonstration against Intervention in Russia, oh July 21st, when it is hoped that similar demonstrations will take plaoe in France arid Italy.    This was the principal cbjeot of the French Delegates JOUHAJJX, DUMOULIK aad D&apos;AaAGQN.\ when they visited the Southport Conference.    It is now stated that the idea of a simultaneous general strike in the three countries originat with RAMSAY McD(MtiW during his visit to Italy.    Warmly supported by SBRRATI end D,ARA0OKA the proposal was put to the French SooialistB, and the ponfederatlon -Generate du Travail, who at first opposed it, has now agreed to call a strike.    It seems likely, however, that a strike may take plaoe in Far is but not universally in the provinces, where the idea is unpopular.The French Government has, however, removed one of the reasons for &quot;the strike by amounoing that the 1907-1916 olasses inclusive will all be demobilized by ootober 30th, On July 4th the Government obtained a vote of confidence by 366 votes to 1.      In England, though H4CD0N&amp;LD was able to49)carry his point through the Committee of Action of the Internationale, it is too early to say whether the strike will be at all general, for the men do not care very muohabout/
about Russia and they do oure ubout losing a day&apos;s wages just before the holidays.    Mr. ESiTOKSQH gave his oonsent &apos;   rather reluctantly and idr. SMIUjWb support is hulf-&apos; hearted.The Nottinghamshire Miners1 Association is proposing to withdraw its War Loan subscription of  55,000, as a protest against intervention and conscriptionDIftSCT ACTIOfl.The prinoiple&apos; of direct action for politioal reasons is dividing the Unions.    The fixeoutive Counoil of the national Sailors1 &amp; Firemen&apos;s Union has passed a resolution protesting against the polioy of the Triple Alliance to &quot;intimidate Parliament&quot; and refusing to take port in the Conference fixed for July 23rd. :  .    Addressing &quot;a meeting on Tower Hill on June 30th, Mr, , DAVID GILiiiOUR of the Scottish ivLiners&apos; Federation protested . against direct action as being &quot;a revolutionary upheaval&quot; which meant the ruin of the oountry and starvation in a fortnight.THJ3 COST OF LIVIIKKStories of profiteering oontinue, to. cause general unrest, and the price of woollen goods is an additional aggravation. f&apos;l ,My correspondent reports th/t in i.Fottingham the workers are oarefully following the reports of Shareholders Meetings; the watering of capital and distribution of bonuses oause bitter comments.  &apos;My oorrespondent adds that some instruction in politioal economy would be beneficial in the distriot, as only,Korxion theories are available for those workers who wish to study the question.
Leioester and Derby maintain that the Government is not fulfilling its promises.    The comments of discharged men in these towns are particularly bitter.It is reported that in BimLngham some 150,000 people are houseless, and in Coventry the workers allege that the authorities consider the erection of Xinematcgraph Theatres more important than the building of houses for&apos; labourers, The same oomplaint la mace at Leeds, and a dispute in the Leads Council Chambers regarding the ereotlon of Picture Falaoes and motor garages has been given wide publicity in the district. .In Liverpool, however, as reported lust week, as well as in manchester and Blaokburn; the Corporations1 schemes are greatly approved by the workers.RATIONALIZATION OF COAL MINES.    -Public opinion in the lower middle class and among superior artisans appears to be hardening against the nationalization of ooal mines, on the natural ground that the publio will have to pay more for its coal.There are indications, scarcely amounting to evidenoe, that miners regard nationalization as a mean rather than an end.    Their objective la the overthrow, by parliamentary] or direot aotion, of the Government, or in the words of a delegate, &quot;If the Government vote against nationalization, I think they will be wrecked and that is what we want&quot;.A Lanarkshire miner expressed the opinion that nationalization &quot;Can only lead to one end... a straight fight between the Government and the Trade Unions and thatTHE HOUSING QUESTION.&apos; My: oo:rr*Bpond*ni^;repor^ that the housing question is still oausing unrest in many districts.    In Glasgow the  d oonditions appear to be deplorable, and workers,^JJotftinghai
is what the Smillie&apos; orowd is after&quot;.The Lanarkshire miners as a whole appear to dislikethe prospect of State management of mines.    The opposition of Clyde business men to nationalization is said to be unanimous.THE PEACE CELEBRATIONS, -There are signs that in some districts, labour leaders are endeavouring to stir up opposition to peace oelebrations.In Glasgow the attitude of the International Union of ex-service Men is suoh that the prooession of discharged men is likely to be abandoned.At Birmingham the secretary of the looal,Trades Council is persuading the workers to abstain from celebration.In Leeds looal orators urge that the date was fixed in the hope of oounteraoting labour demonstrations on July. 20th and 21st.The Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives at Leioester,whioh has a membership of 13,000 has passed a resolution protesting against the loss of working time entailed by the celebrations, and urging members not to take part.The Exeter Labour Party has resolved to abstain from any official part in the celebrations.I4B0tm&apos;8 ATTITUDE Off SUSPICION.&apos;As examples of the susplolouet attitude of labour towards any Government aotion that they do not understand, the following instanoe&amp;may be cited;The distribution of war relios has emphasised the undercurrent of suspioion prevalent amongst the working classes.    They think that Tanks are being dotted about
the country for use against strikers, and there is some disoussion regiixding the purpose of the proposed air-orafj oentres.Demobilised soldierB&quot;who wished to participate in thj demonstration of welcome to Sir Douglas Haig aX kiverpocj when he was given the freedom of the City, refused to register their names, fearing that the registration was t\ some military purpose.     They eventually accepted the explanation that the registration was merely intended to I facilitate the issue of dinner invitations.GLASGOW DISTRICT.Although this district is momentarily quiet, owing to the approaching holidays, employers and workers antioi; serious trouble in the Autumn.There is a steady inorease in revolutionary feeling and the labour bodies, praotically without exception, are in the hands of extremists.    The leaders-9 taotios are summed up by a union seoretaryj   &quot;if the employers meet aifj demand it must not be allowed to ease the position, anothe claim is to be put forward as soon as possible until a position impossible to employers is reached&quot;.    The Unions even when not amalgamated, are so organised that any real grievance, especially a. question of prinoiple, would probably result in a general strike.Extremists command good audiences and their statement now appe;.^ never to be questioned.    Discharged soldiers&apos; organisations, such as the International Union of ex-Servi(( men,are particularly violent, and ore- led. by capable men, who are quick to exploit grievanoes.    It is reported that . unsympathetio decisions regarding pensions are causing much harm among the men b relations, as well as among the^v&quot; men/
men direotly affected.. 18,000 men are reported1to he unemployed j with the exception of oertain skilled men, however, most of these could find work if they wished.NEWCASTLE.....feSTBICff.,: ;... &apos;.Members of the looal iron mpulding industries are reported to be losing faith in their leaders?   the men Complain.that delegates, instead of ascertaining the views of the men whom they are supposed to represent, attend 1   - conferences and on their return inform their members of &apos;       the; aotion - they have taken. &apos;My correspondent reports that the Newcastle Unionist and Conservative Association has Commenced- an- outdoor anti-revolutionary oampaign whioh is meeting with &apos;. -considerable sucoess.The Neath Town Counoil has refused the looal &apos; Socialist Party permission to hold meetings in the Cattle Market,and Pair Field.    as this privilege is exercised &quot;:    by the Conservative and Liberal Parties, the wisdom of theCouncil&apos;s deoision is questionable; it gives oause for a : &apos;  oharge of unfairness and tends to drive agitators underground.At a seoret Bolshevist meeting held at the Hague on dune 5th, it was said that Russian Bolsheviks had provided, via Holland and Norway, large financial and material aid for the Sailors1 Soldiers&apos; and iirmen&apos;s Union, which is preparing for a revolution.Though rather wild assertions are made as to the seoret activities--and growth of this Union, i^ is quite olour that it is now a negligible body.    One of the officials hasoonfosaed/
LONDON WORKERS 1 COMMITTEE.Though this organization is occupied at the moment with the affairs of its two leaders, it works unoeaslngly for revolution.    It is oiroulating the following.Programme of the Clyde Workers&apos; Soviet Committee, which is drafted from the articles of the German Spartaoist Union.    Aooord--:&apos;&apos; ing, however, to a covering letter whioh has come into my&apos;hands, the London Branoh is not entirely in agreement &quot;and would aooept no responsibility.GLASGOW, JUME 2-1 PROGRAMME OF THE CLYDE WORKERS&apos; SOVIET COMMITTEE1.

It is, : imoreover; practically bankrupt. .        f&apos;THE NATIONAL UNION OF EX-SERVICE MSN.This union has adopted a resolution strongly condemning] - -the1action cf the Government in reducing the rate of unemployment donation after 26 weeks.   &apos;At a reoent meeting of the union&apos;,&quot;&apos;E.F. Buller orltioised the aotion of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers in remaining outside the labour movement; , he considered It impossible to be neutral towards labour.
W.F. WATSON appealed against his sentence yesterday, but failed.    The sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment was confirmed and he was ordered to pay the oost of the prosecution He wished to oall Mr. NKEL litACLSAW, M.P. and Commander KEMORTHY, M.F. , as witnesses.but neither appeared.A demonstration has been planned to greet RAMSAY on his release from Pentonville Prison, but arrangements are being made to release him earlier than his confederates expeot.Though accused by WATSON of inefficiency, the Seoretary, KNIGHT, has refused to resign.    J.M. iACfiY has therefore been appointed Organising Seoretary.IKDiSPSHDENT LABOUR PARTY.This party, which is largely responsible for the rumours of an approaching general eleot ion, is Very aot ive.    Meetings have been reported in Coventry, Jarrow, West Salford, Middlesbrough, Liverpool and South Wales.&quot;The Independent Labour party is reported to have issued instruotions that the question of intervention is to take precedence of all other planks in their platform.In/8.

In Leicester the activity of&quot; the *pcxty la ^xesulting-4r.( increased membership; and RAMSAY MaCDGNaLD, by a personal visit, has furthered the cause in the South Yorkshire ooal-fields.;&apos; ,   ,;;&apos;v., f 1At &amp;otting&amp;am on June 22nd an Independent Labour Party speaker advocated the repudiation of all State debts, partioularly War Loan, and the refusal of recognition to the existing standard of currency.Improving on the party polioy of direct action, Alderman Robert MORLflY, of Halifax, is urging the seizure oil all supplies.The Workers&apos; Socialist Federation has now been merged in the Communist League, aooording to an intercepted letter from SYLVIA PANKHURST.    Though still insignificant in its membership, the League is very active and groups have been formed in Rosyth, Edinburgh, and Portobello, and GUY AIDRED is conducting propaganda under the auspices of the Glasgow Anarohist Group.    But, as usually happens in suoh organizations, there is friction between -the leaders, GUY ALDRBD and ROSS WITCOP being accused of making personal profit while the others have to do the dirty work and take the risk.The League is aotive in the Newcastle distriot, where an &quot;educational&quot;:campaign is proposed.An enthusiastic meeting of about 4,000 people, held ,i[ under the auspices of the League at the Liverpool Stadium on June 29th, was addressed by Joseph McDONAGH, M.P,, SeanMILROY,/

Ki3LLY.    The resolution passed demanded the release of Irish prisoners and the speeches were, of a violent nature.The League is reported to be making some progress at Liverpool, where there are two branohes.; QM1RAL FffDSRATluN OF TEADjB UITIOflSThe annual oounoii meeting commenced at Scarborough on July 5th and was continued in private oh July 6th.No vital resolutions were passed, but the Chairman strongly attacked dlireot aotion, Whioh he stigmatised as &quot;a death blow to Trade Unionism&quot;.,   On the whole, the majority appeared to support him, but the aggregate membership of 2,250,000 is no oriterion of the actual influenoe of the Federation, which seems to have passed its zenith.CO-OFSRATIVB LABOUR DEfoONSTRATIOla IN MANCHSSTfiR.A demonstration of some thousands was held at -Manchester on July 5th to protest against the refusal of the Parks&apos; Committee to allow a Co-operative demonstration in the Park.    bavid KIRKWOOD. made.-a violent attaok on the government and there was considerable upro,ir.mum-      . .  :TOM &apos;&amp;Mh,. a prominent British anarohist, is reported to have said th, t the Bolsheviks are antagonistic towards anarohisto, of whom they have murdered quite a number.On July 2nd William ponder; of the east London Workers Committee-, was fined 10/- .on eaoh of six summonses for selling literature and unlawfully soliciting money in victoria Park on May 18th and 25th, 1919.At/
If/,;&apos;! * $1(English) -12-At Marl borough Street on July 7th  (even persons were oonvicted of obstruction and assault as the result of an Internationalist Meeting in Hyde Pork on the previous day, They were sentenced to fines or imprisonment.    A orowd \* some 2,000 was extremely hostile and a raid on the Police Station was feared.THE LABOUR PRESS,The National Labour Press is considering a soheme for the publication of a weekly labour paper in every town in the oountry.   A small oommittee has already been appointed to deal with the matter at Derby.In Glasgow a &quot;Sooialist Information &amp; Res ear oh Bureau1 has been established to collect and disseminate revolutions information.    The bureau is styled the &quot;Intelligence Department of the urmy of the Revolution&quot; and, in addition to the issue of bulletins to affiliated societies, started in June the publication of a magazine entitled &quot;IJata&quot;. The bureau further aims at &quot;the purohase of many British and Foreign, journals&quot;.    There is, however, no indication that the requisite funds are available.&quot;THE DAILY HER JJD&quot;The decision to discontinue sending the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to the krmy of the Rhine, whioh was duly explained by the Secretary of State for War on the 8th, has greatly perturbed MT. GEORGE LANSBURY and his followers, because the loss of income is hitting them rather hard.    At a Branoh Meeting of the &quot;Herald League&quot; on June 29th it was stated thnt the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is losing  800 a week.    Confidential reports show that there 1b considerable opposition to the paper on, the part of the majority of soldiers now serving both in England and abroad.The/
The attempt of the editor to make oapital out of the text of a &quot;new seoret order&quot; dated 23rd June, which has obviously been stolen, will be frustrated by the full statement made by x r. CirORCHIMj in the House of Commons, Attention has been oailed in a former report to the fact that an employee of the paper was offering raoney for the purloining of; documents ,&quot;A journalist who writes on the Cotton Dispute in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; cesoribes it as a &quot;rotten paper&quot;, as his articles always appear in a distorted form.   This w^s the experience also of M. MOULIN, whose artioles on Russia were not only distorted but actually in some oases forged.On the other hand, the sales in Glasgow are reported to be good and increasing, and the paper has contrived to obtain some power iii the National Union of Allotment Holders, through the Vacant Lands Cultivation Society.&quot;THE NEW WORLDVThis organ of the international union of Ex-Servioe Hen is to be suspended owing to lack cf funds.    The Editor states that the paper * whioh has only run 6 weeks, will re-appear on the 1st August next.&quot;THE MASSES&quot;.The management of &quot;The Masses&quot;, t/hioh is in financial straits, will be undertaken by J.M. JsViCEY during WkTSOIfs imprisonment.    The paper has a balance of  8 and the expeoted cost of the next issue is  17.10.0; the circulation is said to be under 3.000,    Of the 10 printers to whom application has been mode only one furnished an estimate, whioh he subsequently withdrew.    Two employees of the expert  Tinting Press are endeavouring to buy the ncoessaryplant/
(English) ,- 14&apos;- ,plant and print the paper themselves,Although the total membership of the Citizen Army exoeeds 8,000, the real supporters dp not exceed 3t5O0j the remainder join merely for social facilities.    It is, however, significant that, many active members hold official! positions in other labour bodies and have, therefore, power to aggravate industrial trouble for their own ends.They have,a sojieme for collecting cartridges of pitexplosive.    My correspondent,saw cartridges pass in Hamilton and Bothwell and the name of one oolleotor isknown.  As it.is impossible to check the amount ofK       &apos; &quot; *&quot; .

This explosive is only suitable for bleating.ZWbW*. ....Little activity has been shewn by the Irish Volunteers during the past week and the large number of searches for arms, though not shewing any great results,,are paying a quieting effect.The attitude of oertain members of the crowd in Dublin on Peaoe night shewed the feeling of B%sntfpathy towards Soldiers and Polioe.    In the course of the evening many of them were hustled, a Royal Air Force lorry,was upset and partly burned and two shots were fired at the.Polioe,De VALBRA&apos;S Amerioan visit, though carefully advertised, does not seem to be making great progress, and9several important American papers ore ridiouling the missis In the meantime, Sinn Fein appears to look a proper leader
and is now standing still.     They nvre, however, boycottingthe Cork City Regatta of which Lord Frenoh is Patron, In Belfast three looal Bolshevists named 0&apos;HAGAN, 0&apos;M\GHEtt and GR.iaNSpH.UN were, sentenced to six-months&apos; imprisonment for making revolutionary speeches.    These oonviotions have had the effeot of stopping public meetings by iibctremists, at any rate for the time being,The Dublin Trades Council has resigned and the new Executive does not contain a single member of the Irish Transport &amp; General Workers&apos; Union,   This is looked upon by &quot;The voioe of Labour&quot; as &quot;a serious blow to the progress of Labour, industrially and politically&quot;.a Proclamation issued in the Dublin Gazette on July 7%h prohibits as dangerous the following associations in the North Riding of Tipperary        The 3inn Fein organization, Sinn Fein Clubs, the Irish Volunteers, the Cumann-Na-Bon and the Gaelio League.B.H.T.
