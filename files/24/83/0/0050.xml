Military Secret.979From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of Stale for India,5th July 19J 9.. (Received 6th, 11 a.m.)9079.   Malleson telegraphs No. M.D. 01842 dated 3rd July :-&quot; Trans-Caspia. Fighting was renewed last night between Annan Sagad and Kaahka. According to Persian telegrams from Frontier this morning it was renewed to-day. There are reports that Bolsheviks are preparing outflank Russian position at Kaahka by movement through Persian territory. Both Persians and Trans-Caspian will expect us to stop any such move.&quot; (A) Am I right in assuming that para. 1 of&quot; your 5323 (?)&apos; M.O. I, 23rd June, empowers me to take delinite action ?&quot; (B) Is the condition of negotiations with Kabul at present moment sufficiently^ satisfactory to justify mv assumption that there is no danger of Afghan attack from Herat?&quot; &apos; 4Later telegraph M.D. 01845 of the same date : &quot; 1. Askabad all well (corrupt group) to-night (?) to-day. Bolshevik made movement through Persian territory, outflanking their position at Kaahka. This has compelled them to abandon Kaahka and retire on Askabad. So far as is known here there is no prepared position between Kaahka and Ask abaci, and Bolshevik advance can only be delayed by such slight dislocation of railway as is possible in time. There are no bridges of any importance, destruction of which could-delay advance.&quot; 2. Belgian Director of Customs informs me to-day that last night Bolsheviks &apos; crossed Persian Frontier in Khakistar District, arrested Customs officers and wounded local Commandant.   He says that many arms at Khakistar Customs House and fears Bolsheviks may advance and seize them.&quot; 3. It is thus clear that in two directions Bolsheviks have crossed Persian borders.&quot;Para. 2. For orders issued to Malleson see our telegram 8567, 24th June. We consider that Malleson alone is in a posilion to judge whether action on his part is likely to be effective and we have replied to him as follows :  &apos;&apos; S. Answer to (A) is yes. You are on the spot and the best judge of the military situation but it will be apparent to you that a force like yours placed so as to threaten the communications of a Bolshevik force advancing on Krasnovodsk can exercise considerable effect and at the same time enable you to discharge your primary duty of protecting North-East Persia from Bolshevik incursion, In this connection you should also consider information contained in my X3, 4th July. Regarding (B) attack from Herat is considered unlikely in present state of negotiations.&quot;Our X3, 4th July, was repetition of Director of Military Intelligence telegram 79413, cypher M. 11 G.S.O. 2, dated 4th July. &apos;      -  &apos;1 Not repeated to India Office. .       &apos;    ***
