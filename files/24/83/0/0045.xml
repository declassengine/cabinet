.&apos;lihe pfope-tv of /   (T 1 , ,5th July 1919........HAVY ACTIMSS 1919 - 1920/ v.. 4 b -Further Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.I have already circulated, the proposals of the. Board of Admiralty in regard to the Navy, and hope that an early day may he appointed for their consideration.2.-      It Is necessary that tho Estimates should he presented to Parliament with very little delay, as they must he taken not later, I suggest, than the third week of this month; and Members will expect to have them in their hands for some littlo time before the Debate takes placeot3o-      The total net amount required is  170,901,500 as   * compared with the last pre-war Estimates of  51,550,000.       * The Board of Admiralty are fully conscious of the fact that the sum asked for is a gigantic one, and they profoundly regret the necessity for making this tremendous demand upon the public purse.   But I venture to point out that the increase of  119,351,500 over tho last prc*-war Estimates is due practically entirely to two causes, both of them the direct consequence of the war and to a large extent outside the control of tho Admiralty*    These causes arc   -(a)   Tho expenditure necessitated by commitments inrespect of the war, which we have to meet, in the current year, and whioh will not recur.This expenditure amounts to............... , 74,762,000.(b) The increases which have been rendered necessary by the changes in pay, allowances, and pensions, or by the present inflation of prices.These amount to........................... 44,571,000.A fuller explanation of these figures will be found in the Appendix attached to this Memorandum.4.-     -I am of course aware that the question will be asked:     Against what possible enemy are you preparing ? As a matter of fact, we have cut down heavily in numbers; we have cancelled an immense number of ships;   and we contemplate that the numbers next year of men should be brought down to at least pre-war level,   if not to something less. But while, happily, the enemies in liurope have disappeared, I would urge my colleagues to remember that, owing to the peculiar geographical constitution of the British Empire, we run constant risks of Unexpected and unforeseen troubles *     Is it not at least prudent to boar in mind that if trouble arises in Ireland - and this seems almost inevitable - it is at least * within the bounds of possibility that the United States of America may be forced by political exigencies of their own to assume hostile action towards ourselves; I do not mean, to make war - but to attempt to dictate.     So long as v;e possess the
mm &apos; P *command of the sea.   and are therefore in this respect independent of all other nations, we can ignore any action of the kind.    But once we lose this supremacy we should undoubtedly find ourselves in a very unploasent and unsatis-faotory position.5*-      Further, I would point out that in peace time the British Navy is the cheapest and most efficient police force that the Empire can possess *    A glance at the map which accompanies this memorandum will show where the various stations are, and what immense areas are polic ed by thorn.     It is a fact that when trouble is threatened in almost any of our oversea possessions, the first thing asked for is the appearance of the White Snsigne    Within the last two or three weeks &apos; we have had req/ucsts for this form of assistance from several parts of the British Umpire   -   the last being from Hewfoundland9    For this work cruisers are requiredj and it is on this account that we are increasing our numbers of this class of ship.6.-      In regard to our building generally it will be seen froi the details contained in Appendix III to my Memorandum of 19th June that we have cancelled every war ship that was possiblej   wo are continuing only those which could not be cancelled without great loss, having regard to their state of advance and the expenditure which has already been incurred, and without creating a very serious situation in the labour world I am sure that the Minister of Labour will bear mo out in my statement that the Admiralty have gone to the very furthest limit possible unless draost dangerous dislocation of labour was to be faced. 17*-      So far as expenditure within our control is concerned I believe the Estimates which we submit, arc really moderate when compared with our needs;   and I can assure my colleagues that the Board of Admiralty have laboured incessantly trying to cut down every item   - and I think I can say with truth that no one of our proposals bias been made without its being given the fullest consicjleration, and without examination and re-examinations(Signed) o   W.

The total expenditure due to (b) is approximately  45,054,000, made up aa follows :-Increase in ratos of pay of permanent Navy ,.i   9,006,000.Increase in rates of Victualling Allowances, etc, grant of Kit-upkeep allowance and increase in rate of grog money...............1..........i   2,600,000.Increase in rates of salaries and wages of normal Civilian personnel...........1..........I   8,900,000.Effect of higher prices.........

(This of course will not recur)......................................      483,eCO. 45,054,000.In addition to the expenditure detailed above, the Estimates for the present year are increased as compared with pre-war Estimates by developments which cannot perhaps be regarded as directly,due to the war, although doubtless influenced by it.     A3 instances of this may be mentioned the provision for Scientific Research and Experiments and for Aviation, which exceeds very considerably that included in the last pre-war Estimates.The present total of the Navy Estimates, viz.,  170,901,500, doe3 not include provision for the proposed increases in the rates of pay etc, of ISfaVal and Marine Officers.     If these proposals are approved, ah addition of about  2,400,000 will require to be made.
