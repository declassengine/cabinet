STATE 0? AFFAIRS IN LIBAU AMD BIG-A. Extract from a letter written by a Petty Officer.EUssia,June 7th 1910........Wo went alongside the Customs House and we were immediatelysurrounded by hundreds of women and children crying &quot;Bread, Mister&quot;., which was their knowledge of English.     The poor classes are, or were practically starving,    Bread (Black) was 18 Roubles a pound. Meat was unobtainable, Potatoes 0 Roubles for 1 Kilogramme and everything else in proportion.     The only people who could live were the Jews and they cornered all the supplies possible and retailed them at impossible prices.     If Bolshevism is ever brought here again it will be caused by the Jews.     They buy anything.   They offer English  1 notes for 100 Cigarettes,  1 for 4 cakes of soap and these if they happen to be luoky enough to buT them are sold to the people at      Roubles each,     Cf course, I mean cigarettes.   IdSon!t mind so much how they sell the cigarettes but it is the food.After we had been here for one day, a Barque arrived from Sweden with a cargo of Potatoese   This had been allowed by the British Mission as wo have a Blockade on this place the reason for which I will explain later,     Those potatoes had been consigned to a Merchant (jew) and we found that he was only selling to the Corporation (All Jews).     So the British Mission refused to release them unless they wore available for the Public generally ?,nd at a reasonable price fixed by tho Mission,     The next day one cf the food ships belonging to the American Mission arrived,   They dis-charged Flour, Rice and other foodstuffs.     Of course this place has been in German hands since 1914 and their methods and adminis-t rat ion are quite in keeping with everything 5,Hunnish&quot;.     So &apos;-Mr. Hun C,in,C&quot;, (general Yon Ser Geltze) decided that the Huns should serve out the rations cf Flour but we decided otherwise and the people can buy 51b, of Flour per head each week at very easy prices.     This is done by the card system.The German Army here no doubt prevented the place becoming Bolshevist although it is well known that Von der $ Goltze was in sympathy and assisting them.     His attitude towards the British and American Missions was such that owing to British complaint he was called to Berlin to explain his conduct.About the 22nd of May the climax arose.   Five Officers from British T.B.d.s.c were arrested by the &quot;Jerrys&quot;.   The German Guard spat at our Officers and insulted them in different ways aid.after considerable trouble to the Commander they were released and an apology asked for.     This was not forthcoming: so a blockade has been placed on the town and no German ships cannenter or leave, so now f; Jerry&quot; mu3t bring his food by land which is very difficultt We then took an A&amp;american food Ship tc Riga, which was taken from the Bolsheviks on the 29th May.     When wo arrived we found tho conditions sluply terrible.   We had an American Mission of five Officers who had been on Food Relief in Serbia, Belgium, France and Poland; but at no plac  vas the people in such a plight as at Riga.The state of Riga was simply terrible.     We gave av/ay biscuits and everything we could spare but it was simply terrible to see a struggling, cursing mass of men, women and children fighting for scraps which one in &quot;Blighty&quot; would not have given to a dog.When the Bolshevics took Riga they arrested 180 Clergymen and 50 of the principal Citizens.     They then issued a statement that as there wa3 J:Ho God&quot; the Churches would be used as Barracks for the Bolsheviks.     They took away all the furniture they wanted from the Middle Class     and said it would be given to the poor. They then declared all Currency Money void and commandeered all Provisions, Goods of all description and opened Bolshevik Shops.They
lliey issued Card3 which allowed people 8 ozs. df Bread a day, if they could afford to buy it.Before one could buy anything he must go to&apos; the Bolshevik Exchange and got Bolshevik money.     He could go to the &quot;Shops&quot; and get his rations by paying 24 Roubles ( 8,8s, pre-war) for a lb. of broad,     The poor could not pay this, so the only way that a man could get food would be to turn Bolshevik or join.the Red Guards as they were called.     He would be sill right for a day Or two and then he would be sent to another town or perhaps killed for some breach of Bolshevik rule.     His family was then at the mercy of the Beasts.The Clergy were tortured if they would not say where the Church Jewels wore hidden..   If they refused anything which protruded from the trunk or face or logs:/ would bo cut off.   The1 worst were the Letts and tho women Bolsheviks. --These&quot; were Lettish Servant Girls or Prostitutes.   The former would tell the BolshevtoVffaere their employers had hidden any valuables and under promise of Social Equality etc committed, some of the most terrible things which are really too terrible to describe,     Any girls of cur class whom they considered too well dressed or too good looking would be insulted raped and disfigured at the whim of the Beasts,,    Nobody was safe. There have been children of 14 years begging for food who are expecting to be mothers through being &quot;raped55 by the devils.There are British Subjects there who through some tie or other&quot; could not leave,     An old Scotch lady named Ball has a husband who has been paralysed for four years, another Englishman had a wife and four children;   the former dying the day the town was captured from the Bolsheviks,   They were in a very bad way but now have been reliefed as far as food will relieve anything^The women Bolsheviks were worse than the men.   They took a family of a rather well off Shopkeeper consisting of man. wife and two children and took them into the woods outside the town,   A third child had gone to a relation&apos;s house and had Stayed, there because it could not get home again before six o&quot;clock which was the time everybody must be indoors.     They made the man dig a hole.   Two women then made the mother and one child watch whilst they fired at the father and other child.   They then shot tho other child and finally the mother.     These are some of the incidents connected with Bolshevik regime and if I was with you I could sit all night and tell you truths of the terrible thlng3 they have done.   The food situation is now somewhat easier since the British aad American. Food Missions have brought food there.This thing is so big that unless it is quashed now there will be trouble throughout tho World,   Their greatest asset is the ignorance of the people.     At Riga I wa3 on the Jetty walking up and down when a Jev/ said to me in very good English &quot;Good Bay, Jackfl I passed the time of the day and we got into conversation.     it eventually got round to Bolshevism and after my condemning it and saying we should never have i!B,f in England, he played the Bolsheviks&apos; highest card.     He said &quot;Bont you think it is a fine thing to get something for nothing?5&apos;.     This is their hold on the poor and ignorant people,.    These commit the most terrible crimes never realising that their share is eaten up by the Heads or if a man becomes too strong or popular with his fellows he is &quot;removed&quot; and that safeguards the Bosses.The Head
The Head of the Bolsheviks in Riga was a man named Stuttgart who was a Lettish Jew*    He was captured in. a train leaving tho station with  85,000 in Russian gold in truoks* The advance was so quick that without making a direct attack the town was surrounded without hardly any fightings    2000 Bolsheviks and 2000 women Bolsheviks were captured or killed and the majority have paid the penalty of their crim.es unless they can prove that they were forced to join the Red Guards*The 0oC* at Riga was a Hun named Colonel Plelchero     It was proved that 200 young people between 14 and 21 were being killed each day during the first three days and at least ten per day after up to the 2nd of June until our Skipper along with the Vice-Consul and Major Fletcher of the American Mission paid him a visit and informed him that he would be the 126th Him Officer to be tried for Murder after peace was signed if he did not stop this shoo tinge    These youngsters were being killed as associates of the Bolsheviks because they would, not submit to the &quot;Sexual requirements&apos;&apos; of the Hun Officers*Tho Hun is everywhere horeo     I oannot help thinking that we in England are making a great mistake.     If the Boys knew the truths of the Bolsheviks there would not be enough ships to bring over the volunteers?      The sights and stories one hears are simply terrible and by the Huns being here we are causing the Russian masses to think that the Huns are going after all to be the saviours of the Country..     In courland and Lettland there are big Gorman landowners^ in fact the Baltic provinces are overrun with them and they are making offers of land free of rentago for five years knowing full well that the Hun will ns&amp;j be only too glad to settle anywhese out of his own ooungry. This means that when a plebiscite of the country is taken the vote will be praotioally German^instead of the Jrma boing worse off he will have gained some of the richest grain and timber land in the world-     In Libau they are everywhere..      Tao language is not Russiano      All ono can he^r is FBpreoken die Doutch&quot;.      In Riga the principal posts^ Harbourmaster, Pilots -everything is Hunnish and I read in the Daily Mail of nearly a week old that Lord Northoliffe says leave Russia to itself-We leave the country not to itself but to the Ban and the Hun Jews who were smuggled through Germany in closed carriages to commence the scheme which has disgusted the civilised worldoBut on the other hand we will suppose he did evaouate the place ,exoept for a couple of thousand Lottish Volunteers-who go with the BSunfl and for about 8 Allied Ships the plaoe will be at the mercy of the !l3ocial Democrats&quot; and *&apos;CommunistsD. These are Sunday names for Bolshevism.      These gentlemen have locally issued a programme Ijo raise  6,000,000 in Rusrian money by Taxation when the Hun leaves^    You can guess the scheme of Taxation?    I have seen some in Riga,?The People here realize that as long as p Jerry&apos;1 and a British Tt.B*D* is here they are safe.     But if Jerry leaves well the people bo gin to worry.     So the Germans are taking advantage of this and Mr* &quot;Jerry&quot; is taking steps to bring Era.u Jerry and the little Jerries so that in a yearvs time the place will be IMf Germany and we shall be realising how sHow we have boen* Tho above states the position at Riga*      Tho Russians detest the Hun but they like him better than the Bolshevik,There is only one thing to doo      This country with organisation -will be the richest country in the world.     It can be made absolutely self-supporting and the Hun can see it and if you in England are content to allow the Hun to become Administrator of the Baltic Provinces and ultimately Russia well I shall be disgusted.
You may think that I am suffering from Hunitis but when I tell you that I was offered  100 if I oould give a Russian Jewess and her husband lessons in English every day for six weeks, you nay realise -what it moanso    Hor husband was a Hun-The lady wasccharming but she was Mr So Hun and that faot and my duties prevented my earning the 100 &quot;Jimmies1^ jhey all want to learn English. 1They have monoy to burn*    All the war there have been Jews&apos;, Russian and German? smuggling stuff from one country to the other      Sacoharine at 2500 marks a Kilo? Oil and anything . necessary to the Fatherland;, bribing the remnant of the Russian Customs because these poor devils could do nothing else and hope to live?; and this is what we are allowing by taking no steps to crush Bolshevism?     Crush that and place the Railways, Customs and Post Offices under the Administration of either England, America or France or do as was done in Crete and now in Greece, and in a few years wo shall be eble to say that all the million-1, which the Rissian failure cost the Allies has been returned tenfoldo    These are the wishes of the Russian people proper but of course not those of Hun origin^
