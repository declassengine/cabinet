JT. 762 5     V vv^V^_^Stf WAR CABINET.AIR MINISTRY OBSERVATIONS ON PAGES 3-5 OF THE REPORT OP THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE (HOUSE OF COMMONS PAPER 113).Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Air.I circulate the following departmental observations for the information of my colleagues.3rd July, 1919. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Paragraphs 15 17 states that 48 cars are maintained for the use of the Air Ministry 33 allotted to officials for their own use, 15 posted for the use generally of the staff. Comment is made on the fact that many of the cars are large and powerfully engined, consuming a quantity of petrol and wearing out many tyres.The Air Ministry observe that the use of motor cars is not confined to the Air Ministry alone among Government departments. The practice&quot; of using cars was taken over from the War Office and Admiralty when the Ministry was first formed. At the time of the Armistice the number was 68. It has been steadily lessened as the work and staff of the Ministry on the service side have contracted. The number now authorized is approximately 24 15 pooled cars, with a reserve of three, and cars specially allotted only to members of the Air Council the precise number depending on the number of members appointed under the new constitution of the Council.On the point as to size and expensiveness of the cars used, the Air Ministry observe that a large proportion of the heavier cars have been dispensed with ; the Rolls-Royce cars have been handed over to the Disposal Board for sale, with the exception of four, the continuance of which is necessary. The majority of the heavier cars remaining are Crossley cars, which is, the standard type in the Royal Air Force.Paragraphs 19, 29 and 21. These paragraphs give correct extracts from the reports of examinations of the log books of the Air Ministry cars in July, 1918, in which reports the amount and nature of the work done by the cars was criticised. The Committees comment is that the report &quot; was sent to the Air Council, who took no action.&quot;The Air Ministry observe that the incidents referred to took place before the Armistice under war conditions and when the decision rested with other persons than those who now control the Air Ministry and who arrived at a decision which seemed to them sound in the circumstances of the time.It is, however, not the fact that the report &quot; was sent to the Air Council who took no action.&quot; The question was dealt with by departmental minutes. The Assistant Financial Secretary pressed for a further reduction in total numbers and for an extension of the principle of pooling cars. The Controller-General of Equipment, the Member of Council responsible, agreed (with the concurrence of the Master-General of Personnel) to the withdrawal of four of the allotted cars, but added the following minute : &quot; I do not think any of the others can be given up. Many of them are in use at places far away from the Hotel Cecil where prohibitive delays would occur if the owners were to draw on the central pool; others, such as those of General Aslnnore and his staffs, are operations cars and can no more be dispensed with than cars belonging to commanders and their staff in the Field. Very substantial reductions have been made in the allotted cars during&apos; the last three or four months and I do not think the number of cars in use by the Air Ministry compares unfavourably with those in use by other Government departments.&quot;Paragraph 22 refers to the-evidence of an official of the Air Ministry and gives extracts from his evidence that his duties were almost wholly at the Hotel Cecil with occasional visits to the War Office and Treasury asked for what he used the car, he(Blu/295)   100  7/19  H&amp;S  72S6wo
said it fetched him from his home in London in the morning, took him out to lunch and home in the evening.The Air Ministry observe that this statement omits material parts of the evidence actually given by the official in question, e.g., that in order to avoid waste he had arranged to say in advance when he would require the car and that otherwise it was to be for common use.The Air Ministry add that the official referred is one of the hardest worked in the Ministry. He was told by the previous Secretary of State to have a car in order to save wear and tear, as he had begun to suffer seriously from the amount of work he had to do under great pressure. He declined to have one, fearing that it would not be fully employed. Eventually he took one as an experiment when his health began to suffer from continuous overwork, giving instructions that the car should be for common use when he did not require it. The practice of coming to the office and going home where the distance is not unreasonable for the purpose is one which has been adopted by Members of Council and others to whom cars have been allotted.Paragraph 23 gives for a week in May an estimate of weekly expenditure for the London Mechanical Transport Section, Kennington 2,495Z. and comments that &quot;this expenditure is at the rate of 129,740/. per annum for touring cars.&quot; A newspaper, taking the figure of 48 Air Ministry touring cars given earlier in the report, has made the calculation that each touring car costs about 2,700/. per annum.The Air Ministry offer the following observations : The Select Committee were supplied with figures&apos; representing expenditure for a week in May on the London Mechanical Transport Section, and with the number of cars maintained out of that expenditure. Included in these cars were the 48 touring cars for the Air Ministry and a total of 190 other motor vehicles maintained for general Royal Air Force purposes in the London district. These 190 vehicles include 31 heavy tenders, 32 light tenders, 3 ambulances, 44 motor cycles, 38 sidecars, and a number of miscellaneous touring cars, largely light Ford cars, used for general Royal Air Force purposes in the London district. The Committee appear to have misread the paper supplied to them and to have taken the figure of expenditure as covering the 48 Air Ministry cars only, whereas in fact it covered the whole 238 vehicles.Further, the particular week in respect of which figures were supplied and which is taken by the Committee as the basis for a calculation of yearly expenditure, does not provide a sound basis, because in that week the wages bill was inflated owing to overlapping between Women Royal Air Force drivers who were being demobilized and civilian drivers who Avere coming in to take their place. The additional expenditure during the week in question due to this cause is estimated at approximately 300/.The particulars above given dispose entirely of the newspaper calculation that the cost of an Air Ministry touring car is 2,700/. per annum. The method adopted by the Committee of arriving at a year&apos;s expenditure by multiplying a week&apos;s expenditure by 52 is unreliable. If, however, the example of the Committee is followed, and the special expenditure of 300/. in the week taken as a basis is deducted so as to arrive at the normal expenditure for a week at the time in question, the expenditure per vehicle per year would be about 480/., setting off tenders against cycles and sidecars and taking an overall average. The Air Ministry estimate that about^oOOZ. a year would be a fair figure for the cost of the Air Ministry touring cars.Paragraph 25. The Committee recommend in this paragraph that the provision of cars for the use of Ministers, officers and officials be discontinued. In paragraph 24 they quote the opinion of the Finance Member of the Air Council that now the war is over the old practice whereby Ministers found their own means of locomotion might be reverted to.&apos; This is a general recommendation affecting other departments as well as the Air Ministry. In considering the question of reductions, the Air Ministry have so far taken the line of allotting cars only to members of the Air Council, and supplying a pool of cars for the use of the rest of the staff. Whether the recommendation of the Committee should be adopted is a question for the Cabinet. The argument from pre-war practice is of doubtful force, the use of motor cars for business and other purposes having very largely increased. Moreover, so far as the Air Ministry is concerned, it is to be expected that heavy pressure of work will continue for at least a year more, owing to the necessities of the reorganization.Paragraphs 26 31 deal with the question of the destruction of aeroplanes. The Air Ministry observe that the figures given in these paragraphs as to aeroplanes on order at the time of the Armistice and as to reductions made in the supply are based on the evidence and are substantially correct.    There is a minor inaccuracy in* This estimate is provisional only - the expenditure is being -    examined with the object of arriving at a figure for the cost of the touring cars separately.
paragraph 27, where the Committee give as an extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Air Council what is, in fact, an extract from a paper put in to the Committee by the Director-General of Supply and Research.The position which the Committee endeavour to establish is that at first the Air Ministry decided on a policy of stopping output to the utmost limit possible, but that the decision, was not adhered to and that &quot; because of labour and other considerations&quot; the Ministry of Munitions, with the concurrence of the Air Ministry, produced more machines than they need have done, some of which machines were sent to National Factories to be scrapped, at a double expense accordingly to the taxpayer. In support of the statement that the decision was not adhered to, the Committee quote the text of a letter sent by the Air Ministry to the Ministry of Munitions on the 6th of December.The actual sequence of events was as follows: At several meetings of the Air Council summoned to discuss problems arising out of the Armistice the question of action to be taken on the particular question of the aircraft contracts of the Ministry of Munitions was discussed, with other Armistice difficulties. Statements were made at these meetings to the effect that as far as Royal Air Force interests alone were concerned none of the machines, &amp;c, to be supplied under these contracts should be taken, if the liability to take them could be got rid of the reason being that progress in aircraft design had been extremely rapid and that so far as the Royal Air Force was concerned it would be to their advantage to have new contracts as required embodying that progress rather than.the machines actually on order at the date of the Armistice, with the exception of a few types of machines embodying the latest improvements which were in production but of which no deliveries had actually been made. The Council, in the course of the discussions, decided that certain types of machines which were clearly out of date should be scrapped. At a meeting on the 29th November the Director-General of Aircraft Production, representing the Ministry of Munitions, stated that they were arranging for the delivery of the fewest possible aeroplanes in accordance with the previous decision of the Council, but they were also taking account of the requirements of the labour situation. The Council then agreed that they would accept from the&apos; Ministry of Munitions whatever aeroplanes they found it necessary to produce in order to meet labour considerations, &amp;c, if necessary entirely new orders could be placed to meet the situation, but in that case the Council must be approached with regard to each specific type of aeroplane for which it was proposed to place entirely new orders. [The Council had in mind in addition to labour considerations mainly the necessity of making an economical settlement with contractors.]This decision represented the formal policy of the Council and was embodied in the letter of the 6th of December to the Ministry of Munitions, the object of which letter was formally to record the results of the previous discussions. The letter stated that under present conditions further deliveries of machines were not in fact required by the Council, referred to labour and other considerations as possibly affecting the action of the supplying Ministry, asked for information as to what output would result from the operation of these considerations, and said the Council would accept such output.   The letter made no references to new contracts.It is to be noted&quot; that during the period when the above discussions were in progress the Air Council were considering their peace requirements the question of jhe number of machines which (could be absorbed obviously turned on this. On the 12th December the then Secretary of State submitted their conclusions on this matter in a memorandum to the War Cabinet. This memorandum, proposed 154 squadrons for the peace Royal Air Force, 62 at full strength, 92 cadres. At the time of the Armistice the actual number of squadrons was about 400, and the programme of the Air Council provided for developing this to well over 500 squadrons by the middle of 1919 the Ministry of Munitions&apos; production programme was framed on this basis, and the whole Air Ministry policy as to aerodromes, personnel of all ranks, &amp;o, was being co-ordinated to fit in with it. These facts are of extreme importance in estimating the situation with which both the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Munitions had to deal at the Armistice. At the end of the memorandum to the War Cabinet Lord Weir said: &quot; I should add that pending demobilization the utmost care is being taken to leave the. question of the post-bellum arrangements for the Royal Air Force and Air Ministry unprejudiced. But in so far as those arrangements are a necessary element in decisions which have to be taken, the proposals made in this paper are being taken as the basis.&quot;The above statement indicates what the action of the Air Ministry was.   They(7255)
made the best estimate possible of peace requirements, embodying a drastic reduction on the war establishment and submitted it to the War Cabinet for decision, putting it on record that where immediate action was requisite, they were acting on the basis given. They notified their supplying department, the Ministry of Munitions, what their policy as regards supply was. They kept in close touch with the supplying department by means of conferences between the officers concerned, in the course of which a sound compromise was obtained between Royal Air Force requirements to meet the peace programme and the output resulting from the application to aircraft contracts of the directions as to labour, &amp;c, given to the supplying department by higher authorities. It is difficult to see what other course of action could have been adopted to meet the emergency.On the general point of policy it will be realized that the cost of resorting to the remedy at common law of breaking contracts wholesale would have been enormous. The supply department not seeing fit to have recourse to that remedy, the Air Council could not but agree to the acceptance of machines up to the requirements of their peace programme, which machines, though not in most cases absolutely the best, could yet be made to fulfil Service needs under that programme. One result of their action is in fact that no machines other than experimental machines will require to be bought during the present financial year.It may be well to add that though attention was repeatedly drawn to the matter, the War Cabinet was never able to give a decision on Lord Weirs memorandum up to the change of Government.On the question of breaking up of machines,- to which special reference is made in paragraphs 29 and 31, the situation has already been explained in the House of Commons by General Seely on 15th May in the statement which follows : &quot;(1.) On the signing of the Armistice the Air Council had some 20,000 aeroplanes and seaplanes on charge, and machines were being produced at the rate of 4,000 a month. The storage available, including hirings which had to be given up, was insufficient to enable these numbers to be stored under cover as well as the new machines of which the Air Council would have to take delivery.&quot; (2.) The Air Council had three alternatives : (i.) To erect or hire buildings to store all serviceable machines, in the hopes that a market would be found for those not required by the Royal Air Force in peace.(ii.) To break up the least valuable machines, sending the useful portions to the Disposal Board and selling the remaining material as scrap.(iii.) To remove the instruments and engines, burn the machines and sell the metal remains as scrap.&quot; (3.) The first alternative would have been very costly and the market for the older machines before they became unserviceable in store did not justify such a course. The third would have required less expenditure of labour, but the disposal authorities of the Ministry of Munitions considered that a market might be found for the salved parts, and the second alternative was, therefore, adopted by the Air Council.&quot;This statement gives the answer to the view expressed by the Committee that what should have been done was to take out engines and other valuable parts and burn the rest.   No ground whatever is advanced by the Committee in support of this view.The Committee allege that machines having been taken over though not needed were sent to the National Factories to be broken up and keep people employed there. The circumstances in which machines were taken over have been already stated. The allegation that machines so taken over were sent to the National Factories to be broken up is incorrect. No such case occurred. What did happen was that a certain number of machines of types declared obsolete for all purposes which were in Royal Air Force dep6ts were reduced to produce by Royal Air Force personnel to release storage accommodation.Paragraph 32. The Committee condemn the buildings at Henlow as faulty, the walls being of 4^-inch bricks and the rain driving through. The Air Ministry append an extract from a Minute by the Administrator of Works and Buildings on this matter: &quot; With reference to your memorandum of the 21st instant quoting an extract from the Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure about faulty construction work at Henlow, I have to state that at the time I took over the
work as Administrator of Works and Buildings, the scarcity of timber and galvanized sheeting became so acute that it was decided to get alternatives and one of the alternatives was brick and as the stations were temporary it was considered that 41-inch thickness was quite sufficient for walls, particularly from an economical point of view. We have erected thousands of square yards of similar walls the same thickness without complaint.&quot; For the purpose referred to 4^-inch thickness was quite ample if the bricks were hard and of good quality, but as we had to take bricks at the time from wherever we could get them handiest, quite irrespective of quality, it is only natural that the weather in exposed places should go through the walls. We never failed to remedy this by applying a coating of auper-cement.&quot; After the Air Council finally decide as to what should be really permanent stations, the walls and some other parts of the buildings must be again gone into. Estimates have already been put forward, and I understand approved for this purpose.&quot;Paragraph 33. The Committee state that the. depot at Henlow appears to have been designed on much too extensive a scale, and only a portion would appear likely to be used in the future. The Air Ministry observe that the depot was designed as a temporary depot, of the size required to provide for the requirements of the war programme of the Ministry, and if it had been of insufficient size for the purpose justifiable criticism would have been levelled at the Ministry for falling short of war needs. The observation that only a portion would appear likely to be used in the future is of general application to such cases in the Air Ministry and doubtless in other service departments. The question of action as regards this and other buildings is being carefully considered in connection with the peace organization of the Royal Air Force.Paragraph 34.--The Committee report that the estimates for the year 1919-20 were presented to Parliament by the Air Ministry before the consent of the Treasury had been obtained, and observe that this is a matter which calls for severe condem-nation. The Air Ministry observe that the circumstances are understood to have already been explained to the Cabinet and the matter dealt with there.Am Ministry,26th June, 1919.   .

FIRST   REPORT.THE SELECT COMMITTEE on National Expenditure have made progress in tho matters to them referred, and have agreed to the following First Report : I. Your Committee have examined the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Bradbury, Mr. Kellaway and Sir Thomas Heath.2. The Treasury would appear to be gradually resuming the control which existed before the Avar. In view of the great increase in tho numbsr of Departments and in their expenditure it would seem advisable that Treasury control should not only be resumed as quickly as possible but that it should also be strengthened.3. We were informed by Sir John Bradbury that two chief circular letters relating to this question were sent 42299/18 of the 6th November, to the War Office, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, and Air Ministry; and 47287/18 of the 11th December to the throe Departments of Agriculture, Ministry of Food, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Reconstruction, Irish Office, and Ministry of National Service.4. Prior to April 1st, 1919, transport charges do not appear to have been debited to the various Departments. Each Department sent goods, and officials travelled, without the cost of such services appearing in the vote. According to the evidence: &quot; In the main tho cost of traffic, both goods and passenger, on Government service was provided out of railway funds and formed part of the charge against the Exchequer in respect of the Railway guarantee.&quot;This system makes it very difficult to ascertain what each Department was actually spending in this direction, and your Committee are glad to learn that it has now been abandoned, and that in the future the expenditure of each Department on these services will appear in their vote. It is to be hoped that there will be no return to the old system.5. After the Treasury have sanctioned the vote for a Department they do not appear to exercise any control over the expenditure of that Department.6. Each Department has an accounting officer who is appointed by the Department with the approval of the Treasury. He is, however, the servant of the Department, who can dismiss him. He reports to the heads of the Department, and if they do not accept his recommendations he has no appeal.7. The position of this official seems to he a difficult one. He may make recommendations to his superiors, but can do no more, and if his efforts are discouraged by them, he may consider it advisable to diminish his activities. Some of these officers, men of high standing in the service, consider that the accounting officer should be appointed by the Treasury, should be responsible to the Treasury, who alone should have power to dismiss him, and that he should report to them.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not hold this view, as he fears the accounting officer would be considered, as it were, a spy on the Department, and his work made difficult.Wo understand, however, that he intends to appoint such an officer in the new Department to be set up by the Ways and Communications Bill. He is of opinion that all reports of the accounting officer should go direct to the Minister at the head of the Department.9. Your Committee consider that the accounting officer of each spending Department should be a Treasury official appointed by, and solely responsible to, the Treasury.10. The work of disposal of surplus stores is under the direction of the Surplus Government Property Disposal Board, which is a part of the organisation of the Ministry of Munitions, and of which Mr. Kellaway, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Minister of that Department, is Chairman. He has nothing to do with the storing or care of the stores, which work is done by the Department concerned. His duties consist in arranging the sales and seeing that proper prices are secured.  Your Committee are of opinion that this is being efficiently carried out.II. Your Committee were anxious to ascertain what was done with the proceeds of these sales, but had some little difficulty in ascertaining what took place.Some witnesses thought- that a suspense account had been established into which these sums were paid and that they could not be got out without the consent of the Treasury. This, however, does not appear to be the case. The monies received are used as appropriations in aid by certain Departments, for the most part the Ministry of Munitions.12. Your Committee consider that these sums should be paid into a suspense account, which should only be dealt with by the Treasury.13. Your Committee regret that no steps have.been taken to set up an Estimates Committee as recommended in the ninth Report of the Committee of 1918. We understand that the Chancellor would approve of a Committee on the lines of the Estimates Committee of 1912-1914.THE AIR MINISTRY.14. Our Sub-Committee on the Air Ministry have met seven times and examined ten witnesses.0.185
MOTOR CARS.15. The number of motor cars kept for tho use of the Department at the present time is 48  of these 33 are allotted to 33 officials for their own use, and 15 are pooled for the use generally of the staff.16. A list is attached of the officials at the date of the investigation who have cars allotted to them17. Many of the cars are very largo and powerfully engined, consuming a quantity ol petrol and wearing out many tyres.18. As it appeared that Mr. Winston Churchill had a car allotted to him, the Sub-Committee inquired if he also had one provided by the War Office. The officer in charge of the motors did not know, but on making enquiry found that a car was provided at tho War Office, and that Mr. Churchill had notified a month ago that he did not also require a car at the Air Ministry. This notification does not appear to have reached the officer in charge.19. Log books recording the journeys of the cars arc kept. The Sub-Committee inquired if those were ever examined, and were informed that two examinations of the allotted cars had taken place in July, 1918.20. The following are the official reports of these examinations : Minute 5.&quot; From an examination of the log books of the allotted cars and requisition slips for the use of Pool cars, it is evident that further considerable economies might be effected.&quot; It is noticed that cars are frequently used for the purpose of conveying officers to and from the various termini, and in some cases are used to &quot;fetch the allottees from their residences in the suburbs, and one appears to make frequent visits to the City.&quot; Cars are also sometimes used for long journeys where the unit visited is at some distance from a railway station, and it seems that the practice adopted by some officers of travelling by train to the nearest station and arranging to be met by a car from the unit might be made universal.&quot;Several journeys seem to be too short to necessitate the use of a car; for instance, one Crossley touring car has been employed during an entire week on journeys between the War Office, Haymarket, and Hotel Cecil, varied by one trip to Liverpool Street Station, total mileage, 106, petrol consumption, 11  gallons.&quot; As regards the cars in the &apos; Pool&apos;: &quot;The daily average number of journeys for one month 20th May to 14th June (Saturdays and Sundays excluded) is 16. The maximum is 24 on one day, and on four days only has the number of journeys been 20 or over.&quot; Liberal provision being made for cars being out of action, the number in the &apos; Pool&apos; 43 seems to be excessive.&quot; 10.7.18.&quot; We have examined the log books of 68 cars forming the &apos; Pool&apos; and allotted cars for the week ended 27th July (seven days). During this week three cars were not used at all. Full details of the journeys made by the other cars are attached. Of these as many as 25 cars had a total mileage of less than 100 for the week. Please see 10a. This examination fully confirms all I said in Minute No. 5.&quot; It is necessary to emphasise the fact that most of the cars are obtained at Kennington, and it frequently happens that a car is requisitioned to make such short journeys as to the War Office and other really adjacent places, and has first to make the journey from Kennington.&quot; &apos; . 16.818.21. This report was sent to the Air Council, who took no action.22. One of the officials who has a car allotted to him informed the Sub-Committee that his duties were almost wholly at the Hotel Cecil, varied by occasional visits to the War Office and the Treasury.Asked for what he used the car, he said it fetched him from his house in London in the morning, took him out to lunch, and took him home again in the evening.23. These cars are garaged at Kennington. The Sub-Committee asked what the cost of maintenance was, and the items for a week in May of this year were handed in. They are as follows: ESTIMATE OF WEEKLY EXPENDITURE OF THE LONDON M.T. SECTION,KENNINGTON.Rents and Rates  -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     45Gas, Electricity, and Water.......15Officers&apos; Salaries   -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -      60Wages......R.A.F.     -   195W.R.A.F. - 260 Civilians -    780-      -  1,235Running Expenses.Petrol, Oil, Grease, etc. -     -     -...... 340Repairs and Renewals  -     -    .-     -     -    &apos; -     -     - 750Miscellaneous       -     -            ....... 50Total  -        2,495It will be observed that this expenditure is at the rate of  129,740 a year for touring eaiv 0.185.
t24. The Sub-Committee examined Lord Londonderry, the Finance Minister to the Air Council, he having been appointed in January of this year, lie stated that in his opinion the cars are too large and use too much, petrol and too many tyres, and&apos;that now tho war is over the old practice whereby Ministers found their own means of locomotion might bo reverted to.25. Your Committee are of opinion that even if it was necessary during the war to provide motor cars, that necessity no longer exists. They consider that the system creates an atmosphere of extravagance which is bad for the staff and the service generally. They recommend that tho provision of cars for the use of Ministers, officers, and officials bo discontinued.DESTRUCTION OF AEROPLANES.26. On November the .11th 25,000 aeroplanes Avore on order. The Air Council met on the 11th, 15th, and 29th November, 1918, to consider the action they should take in view of the Armistice.27. They decided to inform the Ministry of Munitions that they required no more aeroplanes, and the following is an extract from the minutes of the meeting at which they came to this conclusion: Action by Air Ministry after November 11th, 1918, as Regards Reduction ofProduction of Aircraft and Accessories.(a) The Director-General of Aircraft Production, a Ministry of Munitions appointment, is a member of the Air Council.; it is his duty to take such action as is necessary as regards the Avork of the Air Group of the Ministry of Munitions to give effect to the wishes of the Air Council.(b) At a meeting of the Air Council on November 11th, 1918, the day of the Armistice, at which .D.G.A.P. A\ras present, it Avas decided that, in principle, as little equipment as possible Avould be wanted, and this should be all of the most modern type.(6&apos;) At a meeting of the Air Council on November 15th, 1918, at Avhich the D.G.A.P. Avas present, the Secretary of State stated that the Ait Ministry should not take delivery of a single machine winch they could get out of. I brought before the Air Council a list of obsolescent machines; of these lour types Avere still in production. It Avas agreed by the Air Council &quot;that the most rigorous and drastic steps must be taken to shut doAvn further manufacture of these four types. Tho output Avhich could not be cancelled should be sent to store direct, and should not be made over to the Royal Air Force.&quot;(cl) At a meeting of the Air Council on November 29th, 1918, the D.G.A.P. stated that his department Avas arranging for the delivery of the fewest possible aeroplanes.28. These decisions were, hoAvever, not adhered to, and on 6th December, 1918, the folloAving letter Avas Avritten to the Ministry of Munitions :-Subject: Acceptance of Further Deliveries of Aircraft.Sir,I am commanded by the Air Council to state for the information of the Minister of Munitions that they have given consideration to the question of the acceptance of further deliveries of aircraft and engines.The Air Council desire to make it clear that under present conditions further deliveries are not, in fact, required by them. They appreciate, however, that labour and other considerations may prevent the Ministry of Munitions from arranging a complete cessation of further deliveries, and for this reason the Air Council sire prepared to continue to accept aircraft and engines of Avhich continued production is required by these considerations. But they desire to be furnished as early as possible Avith full particulars of the machines and engines which they will bo expected to accept, and they desire to be consulted with regard to each specilic typo of aeroplane for which it may be proposed to place entirely new orders.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant.29. The Sub-Committee asked Avhat Avas meant by &quot; labour and other considerations,&quot; and were informed that instructions were&apos; sent that labour Avas not to be dispersed until after Christmas, 1918. &apos;Accordingly machines Avere taken from contractors Avhich Avere not Avanted, and as National Factories were also to be kept going, it Avas necessary to find work for the people there, with the result that machines, taken from contractors to keep the people there employed, were sent to the National Factories to be destroyed to keep the people there employed.30. After Christmas, 1918, other counsels prevailed, and steps were taken to cancel contracts. At the time of the Armistice, aeroplanes, spare parts, etc., were on order to the extent of 150 millions. This was cut down to about 65 millions. The 25,000 aeroplanes on order were reduced to 13,432.31. The Sub-Committee have visited Henlow, where aeroplanes are being scrapped, and much labour is being spent on dismantling machines, Avhile the product is in many cases of little value. They are of opinion that if the engines and the valuable parts Avere taken out and preserved and the rest burnt, considerable savings would ensue.32. Your Committee desire to express their satisfaction with the management of the camp and the efficiency of the force there. They consider, however, that the construction of the buildings
is faulty, the walls being of bricks only 4i inches in thickness, with tho result that tho rain drives through. If the camp is to bo permanent, the whole of the walls should be cemented on tho outside if only in the interests of the health of the occupants.33. The depot appears to )rour Committee to have been designed on much too extensive a scale, and only a portion would appear likely to be used in the future.ESTIMATES.34. Your Committee have ascertained that the estimates for the year 1919-1920 were presented to Parliament by the Air Ministry before the consent of the Treasury had been obtained. This is a matter which calls for severe condemnation.LIST OF OFFICIALS TO WHOM MOTOR CARS HAVE BEEN ALLOTTED.*Mr. Winston Churchill* Major-Gen.

The operations of the Sugar Commission are very fully described in the first interim report of the Commission presented to both Houses of Parliament in 1917. The whole of the sugar supplies (except molasses and syrup, invert sugar and glucose usecL in brewing) continue to be purchased by the Commission. The Commission have also purchased the sugar supplies for France and Italy. Until recently these purchases were financed by the Treasury, but arrangements have now been made for the transactions to be financed directly by the French and Italian Governments. The policy of the Commission continues; sales of sugar are made at a price to cover all costs and working expenses and with only a sufficient margin of profit to ensure that there shall be no loss on the realization of stocks when the work of the Sugar Commission ceases.36. The Staff&apos; of the Sugar Commission, excluding messengers and cleaners, consists of 51?persons. It appears that this staff barely suffices to cope with the work, Avhich is for the most part highly technical.37. A Trading Account has been prepared, including the whole period from the formation of the Commission until the 31st March, 1918, showing a credit balance of  6,668,993. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on the Vote of Credit Appropriation Account I7rl8, para. 45, states that the Trading Account and Balance Sheet to 31st March, 1918, have been examined by that Department with generally satisfactory results. A Trading Account to the 31st March, 1919, will be prepared, but it is not yet ready. The accounting staff consists of four clerks only, the explanation being that the work is so highly technical that the staff cannot
Gbe increased with advantage. It is estimated by the officers of the Commission that the credit balance as at March 31st, 1919, was approximately  4,700,000. This balance is subject to the estimated freights for sugar contracted for abroad but not in tho United Kingdom, the rates of exchange at the time payments are due for sugar contracted for, but not yet paid for, and certain adjustments Avith the Ministry of Shipping. In estimating this balance, the Treasury has been credited with about  1,000,000 for interest at bank rate on money advanced for the purchase of sugar. A credit and debit account of interest on money used by the Commission has very properly been kept, but the Commission have no knowledge whether interest will be charged by the Treasury.38. Relations between the Sugar Commission and the Sugar Distribution Board at the Ministry of Food have been maintained by the practice of appointing the same Chairman for, both the Sugar Commission and the Sugar Distribution -Board. The relations between the two branches appear to have been harmonious and satisfactory. The work of the Sugar Distribution Board has now greatly diminished, and it is stated that after the end of June it can be performed by a staff of four or five persons.39. The continuance of the Sugar Commission is under consideration. It was hoped that the Commission might be dissolved in September next, but owing to the difficulties of the world&apos;s supplies, of shipping, and of transferring the sugar trade from the Commission into the channels through which it passed previously to the war,&apos;that date is not now possible.40. Your Committee are of opinion that the work of the Sugar Commission has been efficiently carried out without cost to the Treasury.41. During their enquiry our Sub-Committee considered the position of the eleven sugar refineries in the United Kingdom. The annual capacity of these refineries is about 900,000 tons, approximately&apos; one-half of the former requirements of refined sugar. They have been under control during the war, and were able at one period to produce nearly the whole of the refined sugar consumed, which was approximately 1,100,000 tons. More recently the larger consumption of sugar has made necessary the purchase of large quantities of Cuban sugar, refined in the United States of America, at a cost of 5s. 4-^d. per cwt. in excess of the cost of similar sugar produced from British refineries. On the other hand when freights are available, the present cost in this country of Java sugar, refined in the East Indies, is somewhat less than the cost of Java sugar refined in the United Kingdom, though the latter is of better quality. Evidence was also given that no export of beet sugar from Central Europe can be expected for some time.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By WYMAN AND SONS, LIMITED, FETTER LANE, LONDON, E.O. 4.
