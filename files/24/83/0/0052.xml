NQRPHSRN RUSSIA,Arohangel.   The War Office has sanctioned General Ironside^ pro-posal to advance to Kotlas.    The enemy forward position South of Mala Beresnik has been captured with 2 machine guns and 17 prisoners, but the enemy artillery was heavy and aocurate-An enemy foroe about 200 strong attacked Kleshovo on Onega river on 28th June, but the attack was broken up by our artillery,  jhe enemy retired abandoning equipment and small arm ammunition. The Bolsheviks are extensively mining the Dwina in which the water is falling and will this summer fee very low, the least water at present being 4 feet 6 inches.The Minesweeper &quot;Fandango8 struck a mine while sweeping on July 3rd, and has been wrecked, with 1 V/.0* and 4 ratings killed, and 1 Vf. 0. and 2 ratings wounded.Murmansk.

On July 1st, a seaplane obtained a direct hit on a large paddle steamer, crowded with troops, whioh caught fire and sank.In Olonetz Province, the Bolsheviks landed behind the Volunteer lines and bombarded them with armed ships on Lake Ladoga, forcing them to retire.     To counteract this, the Finnish Government is sending regular troops.MEDITERRANEAN.The last British Marine Contingent left Corfu for Malta on June 25th.    The French Military 0.0. has left for Toulon and the French Admiral for Fiume.   The French depot Ship ^Tourville&quot; is remaining at Corfu for the present.BLACK SEA and DANUBE.The situation shows very ponsiderab le improvement. General Denekin&apos;s successes in South-East Russia have been considerable and his troops have occupied the Crimea and thus denied the dockyard of Sevastopol to the Bolsheviks. At Sevastopol no sign of any naval aotivity was found except that the Dreadnought &quot;imperatritsa Maria&quot; has been raised and placed in dock upside down.Further West it is reported that the Bolshevik regime at   * Odessa and Nioolaieff has given way to one under General Gregorieff, who is anti-Bolshevik, but apparently an independent leader.   If he manages to hold these portSj our fears of an anti-submarine campaign in the Black Sea may prove to have been premature.   The Frenoh are occupying Varna.It is understood that the old Danube commission is now functioning, and Admiral Troubridge has been   to Galatz.Several of the monitors which were in Hungarian Bolshevik hands have recently arrived at Belgrade to surrender, and have been interned.CASPIAN.A full report on the action at Fort Alexandrovsk has been received, which shows it to have been a most gallant affair.     Our forces which were outnumbered by about two to one, attackodthe enemy in his harbour, whioh was defended by field guns, sank several of his * hips, and seriously damaged others.The
RED_____SEA..It is proposed to include in the Draft Treaty of Peace with Turkey a provision that the administration of tho Island of Camaran, which shall be used exclusively for the purpose of a quarantine station, shall be entrusted to Great Britain.CHINA.The situation at Shanghai is now easier, and H. M- S. CARLISLE has continued her voyage to vladivostock.The reports from, tho latter plaee are not good, as Perm has been evacuated, and our river gunboats have been compelled to retreat up the Kaiisa.     Captain Wolf Murray reports that he has taken pre-cautions so that no British personnel can be out off.H.M.A*S. *&apos;SYDNEY&quot; has been at Penang., on account of some disturbances which have occurred, but has now continued her voyage.ALLIED NAVAL ARMISTICE COMMISSION.Submarines.The Germans have been informed that Xapitan-Leutnant Kiesewetter,(who is on the submarine connander&apos;s black list, and was arrested at Pahnouth early in May) is being retained in England in accordance with Article 228 of the Peace Treaty.S.S.

II. 60239 410The SU003SS of General Donokin1s operations continues.   He captured Tsaritsin on June 26th, with 10,000 prisoners, and is now advancing on Astrakhan j whioh may fall in a fow days., when our operations in the Caspian would bo at an end.     For ton months we have denied the use of this Sea successively to the Turks and the Bolsheviks, we have also denied the use of oil to the latter, whioh has been a very potent factor in thoir defeat.It is very doubtful whether the Italians are ever going to relieve us in this area, and the Italian Naval Attache has. been informed that if they are not ready to take over by July 15, wo shall hand over the fleet to General Denekin.
BELGIUM.The Press reports that 12 German Torpedo Boats and 26 mine-sweepers will shortly arrive at Antwerp from Dutch waters.   The orpedo Boats referred to are presumably the eleven the validity of hose escape and internment in Holland was questicT33at the time of [,he Armistice.   . It is also stated that, during next week, two G; ubmarines are expected at Antwerp from England.ITALY.The Ministry of Transports is to be abolished and the manage-ent of the Mercantile Navy will be transferred from the Ministry of arine to the Ministry of Commerce.In an interview with our Ambassador Signor Tittoni expressed ilmself anxious to establish good relations with this country   His ;lan for the moment is not to press the Adriatic question but to ettle the African and Asia Minor issues-    He recognises that Prance annot surrender Jibuti.As regards Asia Minor Italy needs facilities for obtaining aw materials and her sphere of influence must secure access to mineral reaso    Without being brought into ultimate conflict with Russia he hinfes Italy can contemplate protection of an autonomous Georgia.The settlement of the Adriatio question, he believes would eoomo easier if Italy realises that the Allies have dealt fairly with; ,er in such issues as the above.     Fiume has assumed a moral preponder-ince in Italy exceeding its real value  but with the Italians a name bans everything and if the Italian oharactor of Plume is recognised key would reconcile themselves to abandoning many other olaimso     A gay out of the impasse would be to maintain a oorridor between Istria id Fiume along the coast and then in the seotion of North Istria it fight be possible to find a line allowing the predominantly Jugo-Soav ppulations to pass to the new State.   In Dalmatia he would be content with practically no hinterland to Sara and Sebenico.Rear-Admiral Giovanni Sochi, the new Minister of Marine is a -rdinian, having been born 1871*     He is a highly-cultured and very yudious officer with a great interest in questions relating to naval ictios and strategy.      He is considered a most oxoollent choice for (Is now position.The 2nd Division of the Battle Squadron (R. A.

ffTOKEY.Admiral Calthorpe has had under consideration what measures Jan he taken,to prevent the Turks sinking their interned men-of-war * This cannot be prevented so long as they have Turkish skeleton crews on board and replacement of these crews by allied personnel is not strictly in accordance with tho Armistice terms, which do? however, forbid the destruction of naval material.    The British, French and Italian High Commissioners will accordingly Jointly inform tho Porte that full value will be exacted for any ships destroyed and that ships sunk and causing obstruction will have to be raised.ADMIRALTY,8th July 1819.t&apos;
