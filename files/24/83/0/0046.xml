hlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos; OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S  OVERRENT)SECRET.       k$% WAR CABINET.8.T. 7646.l^&quot; NAVY    VOTES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Ixcheouer.1. The Navy Votes In detail have now reached the Treasury.They &amp;ake provision for a total gross expenditure of -  182,323,499,less appropriations in Aid  11,421,999, Net total  170,901,500.     The excess over the provisional total for the Vote on Account  149,200,000 18 therefore  21,701,500.     This is sufficiently serious, but further provision of  2,400;000 will be required if the proposals for Officer&apos;s Pay are approved.&apos; 2. Mr. Long-&apos;s Memorandum puts forward for the approvalof the War Cabinet the naval programme for Fleet strength for this year and 1920/21. *3. Navy Vote A for 1914/15 1.6, before the War was 151,000men (including the Royal Naval Air Service).     It will be a profound shock to Parliament and the public to learn that despite the fact that in the years before the war Great Britain was straining every nerve to keep an adequate margin of superiority over the German Fleet Programme on the basis of 16 British to 10 German &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot; despite the surrender of the German Fleet (and its sinking at Scapa Flow), despite the surrender of ,the Austrian and Turkish Fleets, it will be necessary to main-tain In the view of the Admiralty, not In the remainder of 1919/20 but in the period of reduced Fleets 1920/21 a Fleet almost if not quite as large as that which.the German menace still loom-ing was only maintained with extreme difficulty.This too in spite of the&apos;&apos; fact that the Navy is no longer our only weapon of defence:   that we have an Air Force capable of operating on Sea and Overseas, and millions of trained soldiers and sailors available in case of need.4. The British Navy is intended for Defence not aggression.It is therefore wofcth considering the possible Powers or pos-sible combinations of Powers from whom attack might come.    To begin with, the Enemy Fleets are destroyed: and Germany, Austria and Turkey need surely tx&amp; no longer considered.    Russia? For operations in the Baltic perhaps, but not for defence of Great Britain against invasion.    France?   Is it seriously supposed by anyone, even those who are most struck by the chauvinistic attitude of France in Victory, that a war with Great Britain, especially an attempt at invasion ofc a naval struggle has the fainfcaat degree of probability?   Cr Italy? - Is Italy with her difficult internal situation, her high prices, her coal difficulties, likely to try conclusions at sea?   I venture to suggest that all the continental powers whether singly oti in coibination may be ruled out.5. There remuin two, the United States of America and Japan.Both these Powers emerge from the War with enhanced strength: I and both are rather enigmatic in their attitude.    The UnitedK States of America have put forward (and have not abandonedofficially) a great Fleet Programme, and no doubt the Admiralty hold that if it proceeds they must build in competition with it.*But
But even if that were admitted, it must surely be years before the United States of America can he our equal in Fleet material:   and for the period. %o the- end of 1920/21 the security of Great Britain would not be endangered if a much larger proportion of cur capital ships were held in reserve.6. Japan may be suspected by some to haVe ambitiousdesigns in the Pacific which in the long run will bring her into collision with this country.     But apart from the difficulties of her relations with the United States of America, the improbability that she could go to war with Great Britain without also.bringing in the United States of America, and the fact that she has remained loyal to the alliance despite all temptations during the war, - the Admiral-ty disposition of their capital ships places none nearer to Japan than the Mediterranean.     A coup de main by Japan, if ; such were contemplated, could not be anticipated by any Fleet action even under the intended Admiralty disposition of the Fleet, and an interval would have to intervene during which we should collect our ships for an Eastern expedition.     The relegation to reserve forthwith of a larger proportion of our capital ships would therefore be possible without seriously weakening our position as regards Japan.V. On the other hand, it is no doubt desirable on grounds of policy that Great Britain should during the next two or three months maintain nuch a margin of strength as will demon-strate that she is in a position to prevent by force if need be any coup de main by a belligerent e,g. by Italy in the Adriatic.    This.means the continuance in the Mediterranean of a certain number bf capital ships.8. The Admiralty&apos;s disposition of Capital ships Is asfallows:-Battleships. Battle Cruisers.)       (Full 10 .5j Hane (reduced 6(reserve 11 2MediterraneanFull Special Service (AdmiralJellicoe)27 7 3433 8 41The reduction proposed for 1920/21 is from 21 with full crews to 15: the &apos;reduced crews&apos; to be increased from 6 to 8.9. I suggest that this reduction should take effect in not less than 2 or 3 months from the signing cf the Peace: and should be followed by a much larger reduction in 1920/21.10.        If things go well, I do not see why a larger Fleet than say 100,000 men should be required in that year. At least the Admiralty should be pressed extremely hard to make a case for any larger number.     The squadrons which &apos;show the Flag&apos; and keep the Peace in distant waters, theRed
Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Pacific, are not and need not be large, or consist of ships of the heaviest types.&apos;11*       The Fleet in Home Waters requires to be based on a solid block of capital ships.   But, in the present and proe-pective financial condition I cannot think that it would be . reasonable to maintain more thnn a very few in full commission, otherwise than for very brief periods in any year.12.       That the Navy ought to be maintained at the minimum strength consistent with national safety for the next few years, is my firm conviction.    The saving in the burden of the tax-payer, increased exports of coal, decreased ttdnfl\H&amp;pfcianoflLoil fuel, the return to industry of numbers.of skilled mechanics are only a few of tho economic advantages of the measure.&apos; We should retain the power to expand our strength rapidly in case s. of danger and meantime we should secure some alleviation of our burdens.     The financial position is very grave and will become desperate unless- large economies can be made.13.       The whole question seems to turn on two main problems (1) the attitude of the. United S&amp;afees of America and (2) the possibility of rapid expansion when danger threatens.(1) Personally I cannot believe that V&amp;r between United States of America and Great Britain Is anything but unthinkable, above all in the course of the next few years, and the Idea of invasion of these islands from the United States Is even more incredible.As to (2) Mr. Leng does not appear to anticipate great difficulty in expansion of personnel to the larger numbers requisite, so long as the civilians who have been trained in the Navy during the war are available.    I.understand that &quot;reduced&quot; crews represent about 6Q$ of full crews: a Battle-ship the full complement of which is 1,000 men would thus have 600, including all the leading Gunnery and specialised ratings: a reserve crew is much less, comprising I think only care-taking units.    It would under present   conditions take about 6 months to bring a ship from Reserve into sufficient efficiency to place her in the line, and the Naval problem of the future is surely how to reduce the period of 6 months to some much smaller figure by training reserves.(Intd.)
