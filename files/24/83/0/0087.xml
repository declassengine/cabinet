(THIS DOCUMEliT IS T^E PROPERTY OF HISSECRET.WAR CABINET.G.T.7687?.Copy of a letter to the Prime Minister frowH.IJ. OFFICE OP WORKS,Storey s Gate,V/es tmi ns terS .-W. 1*an Accommodation Committee, with Macnamara, Forster and fcellaway as Members, to deal with the conflicting demands of the various War Departments for accommodation in London. -     It soon became&apos;: evident   that tf the Committee were to be effective&apos; It should have full Cabinet Authority and this was accordingly given in June 1917 and its member-ship strengthened by the addition, of Compton-Rickett.      The Committee1a exact terms of reference (original and-revised) are attached.2.    Up to the present the Committee has sat more or less regularly and has held 68 Meetings in all. It has had very  i difficult problems U grapple with but I am glad to say its decisions have generally been loyally accepted by the various Ministers affected. Upon reviewing the situation I am now more than ever con-vinced thafy^ut for the existence of a strong authority of this nature it would have been quite Impossible for the accommodation work ctf my Department to have been carried through during. the &quot;ar.3,    The cessation of hostilities however has completely altered the complexion of affairs so far ss accommodation is concerned.     Entirely new problems have to be faced, and demands from Civil Departments, generally for recon-struction purposes, now replace those of the &quot;tfer Depart-ments.4.    In addition to the fact that the terms of reference of: the existing Committee specifically exclude from its province the requirements of pre-&apos;&apos;ar Departments, the present construction of the Committee is no longer appro-priate. , -  5.     That a committee before with Cabinet authority should still deal with accommodation problems Is, in my opinion, ever more necessary now than during the War, as the period of reconstruction will involve, inter alia, a considerable measure of decentralisation and the provision of a large amount of permanent additional accommodation in and round Whitehall and probably a somewhat drastic general re-allocation of Whitehall accommodation already in the ec-cupation of Government Departments.      . .- , - &apos;/
6,    Accommodation matters as a rule are not of -sufficient importance to justify their consideration by the whole Geuinet but as ohey often Involve      a differences between Ministers it will be a sine qua non that in future tne aceommc*dafcior^Comnfii.ttee, if it is to be effective, should be;-7,    The best possible Committee for this purpose would undoubtedly be - The Leader of the House, The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Commissioner of Works.8.    I make this suggestion atter very careful consideration and with full knowledge and experience of what, is required and sincerely hope it will meet with your approval.     There would really be very little for the other two Members of the Committee to do as its ordinary business could be transacted by me as First Commissioner of Works and any matters of extreme importance could probably be discussed personally by me with each of the other two Members without troubling them to attend formal meetings.9i    The New Committee might be styled the Cabinet Committee on Accommodation and I would propose that its terms of reference should be &quot;To have Cabinet Authority to decide   all questions relating to the office and ttorage accommodation for administrative purposes of all Government Departments in London&quot;o10*    If you agree, as I trust  ou will to the formation of the new Committee as suggested, I would then propose to dissolve the present Committee in your name and convey your thanks for the very valuable services which have have rendered curing the war *(a) a supreme body, whose decisions should have Cabinet authority.(b) constituted of Ministers outside the Departments concerned.Yours sincerely,(Signed) Alfred Mond.The Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George, M.P., 10, Downing Street,S e W I 1 .
