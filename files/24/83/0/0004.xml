Afghanistan. Following from Ross-Keppei. First, dated 28th June?- &quot; Reported that Sardar Ali Ahmed Jan, head of Afghan. Peace Delegation, has arrived at Kahi to meet an Afridi jirga, and it is stated that he has been (corrupt group) inspecting the troops and military arrangements, (? secretly communicating) Kabul and Dakka. There is much talk of renewal of hostilities by Amir after the Id, and general expectation of an Afghan attack on. Dakka, but the wish is probably the father to the thought, as there are no sign of any preparations on a large scale.&quot;Second, dated 29th June : &quot; On Friday, 27th June, a large number of Shinwaris, Khugianis, Mangals, Mohmauds, and Afridis collected near Khamti Kahani at the invitation of Afghan officials.   Total estimated at about 13,000.    Leaders were collected and addressed by a high Afghan General, whom the people believed to be Nadir Khan, though this can hardly be Nadir Khan of Thai fame, as he is believed to be still in Khost.   Possibly it was Ali Ahmad.   The Afghan official speaker assured the tribesmen that hostilities would recommence in three or four days after the Id, and would continue without intermission until the British had accepted the Amir&apos;s terms.    Peace delegation would go to Rawalpindi as arranged, but this would Lie merely to gain time as there was no hope of peace without victory, and the Amir had no intention of  making peace unless his   demands  were  agreed to in full.    Amir wished to complete his preparations which were proceeding very satisfactorily and attacks on British forces would continue in spite of peace negotiations unless the British withdrew in accordance with Amir&apos;s demands from Afghan (? limits) and from territory of tribes in alliance with Afghanistan. Afridis present pointed out that it was unlikely that their tribe would rise unless the Amir came (corrupt group) and conducted the war in person, as they had frequently been encouraged  to join Afghans before and had invariably been deserted by (? Afghans) and suffered for it.   Afghan officials assured them Amir would agree to no peace terms which did not include complete amnesty for all frontier tribes who had joined him, and that he would in future consider all their territory as part of Afghanistan.   Of the Afridi deserters present about 120 who claimed a knowledge of signalling were selected and despatched to Kabul to act as instructors.   All other deserters were invited to Jalalabad to be formed into a regiment.   Afridis asked what the Amir would do against the British aeroplanes and big guns, and Afghan officials replied arrangements were being made for both and would shortly be completed.   Men have been sent to Tirah to invite to Jalalabad all the remaining deserters from regiments and (corrupt group)s.   Afridis who (&apos;? went to) Kahi are not representative of the tribe, but their reports must necessarily have some effect and belief is becoming general that Amir has recovered from shock of our initial success in occupying Dakka and burning Jalalabad and Kabul and has been persuaded to go on fighting unless Government agree to. his terms. Iii the second half of May, Afgtians were very depressed and fully expected a rapid advance on Jalalabad and possibly on Kabul and Amir&apos;s first suggestions of negotiations were inspired by this mood, but our long inaction has caused him to take heart and he is encouraged by many letters from India assuring him of sympathy and help and of extreme disinclination of Government for war.   Afghan peace delegates are said, to be at Jalalabad and to be leaving for Rawalpindi aftffr the Id.&quot; Donald telegraphs from Hangu, 28th instant, 20 hours, that Mullah Ahmad Nur of Thai has been arrested on suspicion by Nadir Khan and sent to Kabul. Saddu Khan, the Madda Khel Wazir Malik quarrelled with Nadir Khan whom he accused of; having left Wazirs in the lurch. Nadir replied that he could do nothing more without the Amir&apos;s orders. Matun garrison reported to be three regiments regular infantry, three cavalry, one battery. Reinforcements of Ghilzais said to have arrived and sent with small detachments artillery to Kurram and&quot; Tochi borders. There is general expectation amongst the Orakzai of renewal of hostilities on the approach of the fourth day after Id and lashkar have arranged to collect, but, in Donald&apos;s opinion, Orakzai are unlikely to rise without definite help from Kabul. (?Mahsud) districts and agencies quiet and universal expectation of resumption of fighting in a few days. Id begins this evening. C.C. of the North-West Frontier Province.&quot;Following from Waziristan, dated 29th June : &quot;Situation generally unchanged. The Bhitani jirga gave in 10 Government sniders to-day and promised to return militia rifles by third.   The Wana Wazirs at a recent conference decided that no militia rifles were to be sold outside the tribe as all such rifles would have to be returned.&quot;Following from Teheran, dated 28th June : &quot; Russian Legation informs me telegram from Bolsheviks at Tashkend to Moscow has been intercepted, saying * Afghans have betrayed us.&apos;   I report information for what it is worth.&quot;
