ITOTB   BY   THE   HBIIST3B OP HBOUB,Draft Bill to Constitute a Commission to inquire into and report on minimum rates of wages and for purposesT connected   therewith.ggg^jg^ate for the information of the Cabinet the draft of a Bill constituting the Minimum Kates of jages Commission, which has &quot;been prepared in the following circumstances the Industrial Conference called by the Government appointed a Provisional Joint Committee consisting of equal numbers of employers and workmen, to consider, among other matters, questions relating to wages, and the Committee made the following recommendations with regard to wages:g1.      Minimum time-rates of wages should bo establishedby legal enactment and should be universally applicable.2.      A Commission should be appointed immediately uponthe passing of the Act to report within three months as to what these rates should be,.and by what methods and what successive steps they should be brought into operation.    The Commission should advise on the means of carrying out the necessary administrative work.3,      In the meantime Trade Boards should be established forthwith in the various less, organised trades where they do not already exist.4,      The Commission should review the Trade Boards Acts, especially with the object of facilitating and expediting as far as possible the procedure in fixing and applying minimum rates.5.      The .Minister of Labour, on the recommendation of theproposed national Industrial Council, should appoint the Commission, which should consist of an equal number of representatives, of Employers&apos; Associations and Trade Unions, with a Chairman nominated by the Government,6. The Commission should give adequate public notice of its proposed findings and should hear representatives of any ?Prade that may desire to be heard.. 7.      Where an agreement was arrived at between representative organisations of Employers and Trade Unions in any trade laying down a minimum rate of wages the Minister of labour should have power, afte? investigation, to apply such minimum rate, with such modification as he might think fit, -to all employers engaged in the trade falling within the scope of the agreement.After these recommendations had been considered by theGovernment, the Prime Minister wrote as follows:-
-*I fully accept In principle your recommendations as to the fixing of maximum hours and minimum rates of &quot;/ages.As regards wages, I accept the principle that minimum rates of &apos;-&apos;agcs should in all industries be made applicable by law,     The question of the best method of doing this, however, is complex and full of difficulties, and I do not think that it would be possible to frame legislation until a scheme for carrying out the, principle of minimum rates has boon fully worked out.I therefore gladly accept your suggestion that the Government should, in the first place, set up a Commission with wide terms of reference to&quot; report on the whole matter.,n Since the Government* s proposals have been communicated .     ^ to the Joint Committee they have given consideration to thorn and rrhile they are in agreement that a Commission should be set up,, they have urged that in accordance with their original proposals statutory * sanction to the principle of a national minimum ^ago should be given by Parliament before the appointment of the Commission^It was proposed to the Joint Committee that the Commission &apos;*;-., should not bo empowered to fix minimum rates of wages., but that they should enquire as to the basis on which such rates should be fixed, regard being had to the cost of living and to all other relevant matters..     It was suggested also that the scope of the enquiry should be limited to men and women over 18 years of age employed in trade and&quot;&apos; industry.These proposals, however, were not accepted by the JointCommittee, and after several discussions on the points at issue, they .have continued to press for the following revisions;-fa)   That the Bill shall apply to all adults and young persons,,(b)   That the minimum rates shall be such as to provide an adequate living wage..
(c)   That the Commission shall have the power to decide what those rates shall be, subject to their subsequent enactment by Parliament. &apos;. .The Bill, therefore, contains in its preamble adeclaration that it is expedient that minimum time rates ofwages should be fixed for all persons over the age of 18 years-,.,.wan&amp;should be fixed at such amounts that all such persons will be afforded an adequate living wage.     This principle, it may be pointed out, was peaceably approved by S. I - Part XIII of thePeace Treaty in the following terms:-whereas an improvement of conditions is urgently required as for example by the provision of an adequate living wage.&quot;As to young persons, the Bill declares that it is expedient that minimum time rates should be fixed for young persons aged 15 years and not more than 18 years of age.     It was, of course, impossible to state that, wages for young persons should bo fixed so as to provide an adequate living wage.The Bill proceeds to give the necessary power to appoint a Commission for this purpose, the terms of reference being as follows:-(a) &quot;inquiring into and deciding what the minimum time rates of wages for adults and young persons should be, regard being had to the cost of living in the various districts and all matters which appear to the commissioners relevant.(b) /Inquiring into and making recoimnendations as to the methods and successive steps by which such minimum time rates of ? wages should be brought into operation; and the machinery by which they may be varied as and when occasion requires.(6)   Enquiring into and making recommendations as to the granting of exemptions from the rates so fixed in the case of infirmed and incapable workers and in other exceptional .. cases, and the methods by ^hich such exemptions should be granted.(d)   Making recommendations as to the legislation necessary for such purposes as aforesaid fwheroby amendments &apos; of the Trade&quot;Boards Acts 1909 and 1910, and other enactments relating to minimum rates of wages or otherwise) and what, amendments cf th,e &quot;a-.    r: any, ar   desirable.Although it is not specifically provided in the Bill, it is proposed that representatives of employers and workers shall K appointed to be members.     In accordance with the desire of the Departments the Joint Committee have agreed also to the appointment
&apos;&quot; *of independent members one of whom would he Chairman.     It appeared to me desirable that the Chairman should be assisted by a certain number of independent colleagues in order that the responsibility imposed on him mi glib not be excessive, although in the first place the Joint &quot;Committee recommended that the members of the Commission, except the Chairman, should be confined to employers and workers representatives.     It was agreed that the Commission should consist of three representatives of the employers, three of the workers1 and thiee independent members appointed by the Government &apos; including the Chairman.The powers conferred upon the Commissioners follow the lines usual in such cases.The Bill provides that the report of the Commissioners should be laid as soon as may be before both Houses of Parliament and the question of further legislation.will depend on the nature of the Commissioners&apos; report.(Signed) R.3.H.End July, 1919.
