.7685.     Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.One of the chief causes of the labour restlessness at the present time is undoubtedly the widespread conviction that manufacturers, dealers and-shop-keepers are4generally making excessive profits.    Feeling is running high, and I fear that if something is not done, serious consequences may result. .The most exoeditious and effective way of dealing with the situation, in my opinion, is to set up Tribunals to re-ceive complaints from the genoral public and settle in the cases brought before them what are reasonable charges for the retailer to make; and, at the same time, for the Board of Trade to set on foot an investigation into alleged profit eering by others than by retailers, and on the results of the investigation to mm any regulations that seem to be called for.If this course were adopted the public would feel that the Government was determined to discover the facts and protect the community against   exorbitant charges.  This alone, I believe, would materially check the growing agitation which has already become menacing.Moreover it might be found that the excessive profits&apos; of which complaint Is made were not so huge as they are supposed to be in a great number of cases; that in many instances profiteering does not exist; and that in the mjority 01 cases the cost of living is not very greatly Elected.  If this should turn out to be the case, it is urgent that the public should know.My recommendations are briefly as follows:-Small Txlbunals should be set up in all urban and rural districts (except that smaller ones should be combined) to receive complaints about excossive charges made by retailers They should be empowered (a) to revise the charges made and (b) to impose penalties in bad cases.To secure uniformity in the standards adopted by Tribunals in different places, and to guard against unreason able rulings, it would be necessary to allow appeal to a Central Tribunal on certain conditions.1 m convinced that confidence would be, to a large exteat, restored by thus creating throughout the country popular bodies to near complaints and act summarily to protect tho community, under the limitations and safeguards that are necessary to maintain the enterprise upon which the recovery of the country is dependent and otherwise to pre-tent damage from being done to the economic system.
Bat those Tribunals alone would not be sufficient. I&amp;orbitant prices are not sololy, or mainly, due to the profits made by retailers, and the problem of the excessive prices due to other factors is far more difficult to soltfe.Consequently I propose further that the Board of Trade should conduct investigations into U$h. prices of which complaint was mado, so far as they wor* not due to retailers1 proiits, and have adequate powers of compelling evidence and establishing costs of production,   ua the results of tho investigations. I suggest further that they should have the power to take appropriate action, such as fixing margins, prohibiting doallng without licence, or fixing maximum prieos.This would entail the establishment of a new and con-siderable Department at the Board of Trade, and it would probably be Sound necessary for the Board to exercise some of its powers through the agency of a Central Tribunal. In cases in which the host course of action was not covered by any of the powers given to the Board, recommondations would be made to tho Cabinet.I attach as an appendix the Headings of the Bill which I think should be introduced at onct.12.7.19.
