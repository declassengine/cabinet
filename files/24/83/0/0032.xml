JtJ3,Y (G,tt,7598) DELATING to A C 2 OillOPA tI OF OF OOVEW^nt T/TiPAKENTS Ijj loni ON *1&apos;emo by the President of the Board egypt Fducation.1..       I wish to uro-e t:obi- strongly upon tho var Cabinet the desirability of adopting Sir Alfred I;;.ond&apos;s recommendation in paragraph 7 (7) of his Minute of 1st, July fa.?.7598) for the? removal of the Admiralty Controllers Staff and the restoration of the Board of Education-staff from South Kensington to the New Block in Whitehall.I thiak the figure of 1100 staff which he assigns to the Board of Education ought to be 1300, though I am Quito willing tc make sacrifices, on an equal footing with other departments, by way of housing some Sections of the staff in convenient buildings in the neighbourhood of Whitehall. &apos;    I think that in this respect there ought to be equality of sacrifice amon? those i&apos;;ho share this building. I doubt, however, whether all allowance is made for this it &apos;.&apos;ill be possible to house 1100 members of the staff of the Hoard of Trade in tho Block, in addition to the Ministry of Health, the Board of Education ?.nfl the Office of Works.2,       My main desire, however, is to emphasise particularly the urgent necessity for the restoration of. the Board of Education staff to this Block at the earliest possible moment.     I consented tc the removal of the staff to South Kensington with great reluctance, and only because such removal ras necessary to the successful prosecution of the war. The inconvenience has been very great: and in viev of the preat development of education which is Imminent the public interest is bound to suffer unless it is remedied.    The reasons for vacating the Iluseum at the earliest possible moment are strong; it is imperative that the buildinp belonging to the Imperial College, which are occupied by a lar^e section of the Board&apos;s staf^, should be vacated by the end of July; and apart from this the staff has outgrown the iluseum accommodation
3.      I observe that in paragraph 7 (1) of his Minute Sir Alfred Mond recommends that the whole question of decentralisation should be referred to the liar Cabinet Committee on-Government Staffs, with powers and terms of reference sufficient to enable them to give decisions . I hope, however, that the Committee will not be empowered to reverse or delay the execution of Sir Alfred Mond.-&apos;s recommendation for the restoration of the Board of Education staff to the Whitehall Block,(Signed) HcA.Lo FISHER.July 4th, 1919,
