WAR C^BTIJKT, 27.6.19. i Mlj,7630. &apos; BULGARIA.Memorandum, as to the present state of tho Bulgarian Reparation Clauses; for the use of whoever takes up this matter, now that Lord cunliffe and I are leaving Paris.1At 3 this afternoon the Bulgarian Committee met for what wasto have been its last meeting.   Subject to a   perfectly clear cut difference of opinion between tho French and Italians on one side and the British on the.other,   a complete set of clauses could have been agreed this day.This point in difference was that the British wished (Art.II) to provide that the Bulgarian Commission should bo ea^&apos;^;^ to give the Bulgarian Government good discharge for all payments, and that the Treaty itself should not provide in what particular way the Governments interested should direct such payments to be dealt with, but should only preserve their rights, whatever they wight be.The French, with their passion for &quot;precision&quot; in season and out of season, insisted that the Bulgarian Commission must hand over april y and bonds to the Reparation Commissionj that nothing should be left to free choice o.f the powers; and that wo, tho Committee, must settle everything in advance.   They carried this so far, that they produced a set of clauses, by which the Bulgarian   Commission was to (be a mere special section of the Reparation Commission, both nomina-ted by it and responsible to it, though in name they were the delegates and representatives of Franco, Groat Britain and Italy separately.This was dead in the teeth of a MOHofandum (annexed hereto) which ?as circulated on June 4th and v.hich the French had accepted,   Hew-sver this went for nothing.   On 27th June the Committee was at issue n this point and would have sent it up to the Chiefs for them to
Hitherto, though,a U.S.A.representative had attended theCommittee)s meeting  cr throe weeks,.it was, as he said, only aa a   1.    . 1 &apos; I- Ifriendly observer, the U.S.A, not having been at war vritr Bulgaria and jj not wishing to take a hand in any settlement.To-day all this changed - a new U.S.A,representative came, to take an active part in our discussions.   He would not say exactly what the U.S.A. meant to do, whether to join in the Treaty or not. He would not pledge himself to say what particular objections he meant to raise.   He was merely there to interfere and to upset what was all but settled and he did it.This interference was of course fatal to our concluding our work: all sorts of tilings were rediscussed and half tho clauses we never touched at all.      To-day the effect was chiefly that the U.s,A,supported Prance; we have no certainty that on a future day more objections will not be raised, even to reviewing the agreed clauses.As matters stand, if the U,S*A.interfere no further, the clauses could quickly bsf. agreed in two alternative forms, ready for a superior decision,The scheme proposed by the British Delegation has always been this: &quot;Let us get rid of&quot;categories&quot; and the &quot;evaluation&quot; of Reparations,let us fix a lump sum for all kinds of. damages, and set up a commission, partly to get the money out of Bulgaria, partly to try to help her to reform her finance and to develop her resources.   Tho less Bulgaria is mixed up with the already overloaded &quot;Separation Commission the better-.The French, who at first approved of this, now insist on  bringing in tho Reparation Commission, and to settle, now in the Bulgarian Treaty, what does not concern Bulgaria and is quite premature, namely, the machinery by which Bulgarian payments, when received, shall be divided among the Allies in accordance with their rights.
They further insist on making tne Bulgarian, committee^eion a more special section of the Reparation Commission, and respcnialhXe, to it -that is tho delegates of the powers, who form the Bulgarian.*)cmnii3-i34 nv* in France, Great Britain and Italy, will be instructed by and will-., probably be nominated by the Reparation Commission, on which two others-powers, thQ and another, will have an equal representation anc! vote.Of course this is goodbye to any hope of making the Bulgarian Commission a useful organ of political control over Bulgaria in tho interests of the Entente Powers against the ex-Enemy Powers, and re-duces it to a mere book-keeping body.     Such is the result of French jealousy - of course to the U.S.A. a plan that deprives Great Britain from acquiring even jointly with France and Italy, any special position of advantage, however,beneficial it is generally, is a plan to be supported with vigour.The result is a clean issue.   If the ^rench plan is adopted, there is not much to be said against their clauses, except that they are needlessly diffuse.     If the British plan holds the field,, there is no reason to bring in the Reparation Commission at all.   The British Article II should simply say &quot;Bulgaria will pay to the Bulgaria Commission and get from it a full discharge.&quot;    There is no need to say more.   The Annexe will need a little amplifying.1   The Commission, should have the power of sub-delegation - so as to negative the maxim &quot;Dolegatus non potest dologare&quot;;- - its quorum should be settled say at 2; It should be brought to an end when Bulgaria has paid In full ond the money has been distributed. .
There is also Article VIII, which needs some amending.. I want the grant of all concessions by Bulgaria to pass through the Commission&apos;s,hands, so that they may be taxed or-sold for the benefit of our CompensartXon..,Fund.   This wants to be more clearly expressed.   The U.S.A. oppos^Jjtr-^L *i^^Theiar chief reason for the plan of the British Delegation of having no categories but only a lump sum is this.   If Bulgaria pays for particular liabilities under categories only, then those payments will ensttyeto Germany&apos;s benefit. . Germany can say - &quot;the debts are joint, for they are debts owed for-the same things on the same categories; so far as Bulgaria pays we need not; otherwise we should be paying twice over. Hence, ^hen we have paid in full all but the last  9O,OOOyO0Q of our Treaty liability we can, stop paying if Bulgaria has already paid that sum; for then she has paid you already that. -amount for the same things that we have been paying for.&quot; This possibility may be remote, but one must,not throw away -the chance, where 3uch large sums are Involved.   By the plan, adopted &quot;compensation&quot; is the lord used and &quot;/Reparation&quot; is  . not mentioned; this &quot;compensation&quot;.is for losses and damages -&quot;of all sorts&quot;, and the sum is a lump sum.   Thus Germany never-, could tell what Bulgaria had paid for -it might have been . costs of the war, which is within &quot;losses rf all sorts&quot;. If so, Bulgaria and Germany would not be paying the same debts and both sums must be paid :n full.The French do not see this ,-. they have put a distorted meaning on the word &quot;solidarite&apos;V:which they call a principle, and think it involves uniformity of machinery.   The above point cannot be stated openly at the Committee,, for, if the U.S.A. perceived it,, they would at once insist on defeating it in the name of the XIV points (which have nothing to oh with Bulgaria) and for the sake of diminishing the amount that Britain&apos;s enemies are to pay Britain,.-nfoich is their
(Signed)  1 SUMMER.steady policy.It is,, therefore, very, important that Article I, on the wording &quot;of which this point turns, should not he altered at all.:   It has been agreed, as it stands.   There should be no going back on It.   The French and   Italians first agreed to and then became afraid of  90,000,000 but it is novr agreed that the Bulgarian Commission is to have power by a unanimous vote to reduce it * and that should quiet all doubts: and there Is no justification for trying to re-open Article I.It is essential, in order that **e may keep a proper independence with regard to this remission of debt, that the delegates on the Bulgarian Commission - whether it Is a special section of the Reparation Commission or n^t - should be appointed and instructed by their Governments direct. At present, I understand, France, Italy and probably the U.3.A. would accept this.
4th June 1919.BULGARIA..To. apply to Bulgaria the same type of clauses as the German Treaty contains presents some difficulties.   It was done with the Austrian clauses, but that was because Austria was in fact guilty very much as Germany was, both in forcing cn the war and in conducting it inhumanly, and-&quot;solidarity&quot; therefore involved similarity of treatment.Bulgaria&apos;s conduct has been inexcusable, both in-attacking Serbia and in her way of making war, but to apply the full theory of eolidarite to her is more difficult, for she came into the war late and was the first to surrender ana she took no part in the war in the West or at sea.Further, for so small a country, the machinery ofthe Reparation Commission is perhaps excessive, while, smallas Bulgaria is, the addition of her case to the already heavyisburden of the Reparation Commission/to be deprecated.   In practice the Commission would delegate Bulgaria to a special section.   The Commission would be responsible but would not give personal attention;   the special section would have the real power but not the theoretical responsibility.   This position is not satisfactory cither from tho Allied Powers&apos; point of view or from that of Bulgaria.Again Bulgaria is small both In csfr&amp;a and in population compared with Germany and her circumstances are quite distinct from those of Austria.Her capacity to pay, though quite substantial, is limited and she presents none of the commercial and industrial problems, which are so numerous and so complex in the case of Germany.It is certain on the one hand, that she ought to pay heavily for the wrongs she has done not only to Serbia
but the Allies   generally; it is certain also that tho limits of her capacity to pay would be reached long before her moral responsibility was exhausted.There ist therefore, no such difficulty in fixing a lump sum for her liability as existed in Germany^ case; nor is there tho same reason as in Austria&apos;s case for requiring her formally to admit liability jointly with her associates in the war.    Accordingly I suggest that the plan should be adopted of fixing her liability in the Treaty once and for all..     It would be done chiefly by ref-erenco to her capacity to pay.   Categories of damage and long inquiries into costs of rebuilding would be needless for Bulgaria&apos;s means would be exhausted long before her bill was paid.In her case there would be a separate Commission, whose task would be not to fix her liability but to fix the time and mode of payment, the instalments,the interests and the security, and to make appropriate steps to enforce payment. Its principal duties would be administrative.Bulgaria has a population, industrious and enterprising but unaccustomed to much intercourse with the world at large.   Greater prosperity would make them less restless, wider relations with other countries would make them less egotistical and s^essive:. in both ways Bulgaria, as well as her neighbours, would gain, for Bulgaria has been in the past a great disturber of peace in the Balkans and what the Balkans most want is peace..Without Interfering  with the internal affairs of Bulgaria and Commission would, for tho purpose of enforcing payment and assisting that development which will make payment easy, have aaneas to information and records bearing on
financial questions, be entitled to give advice to tho Bulgarian Government and to make representations on such subjects to the Allied Governments represented on the Commission, and, in case of need, would be empowered to t&amp;ke possession of State Railways end State monopolies and customs houses for tho service of the debt.If it had authority to accept part payment in local currency, it would naturally invest that payment in local Undertakings, and thus assist in developing; the mineral resources (whioh exist though they are not very extensile), the public utilities and the industrial opportunities of Bulgaria, ond so in time would both secure payment of the debt and assist in stabilising Bulgaria by giving to an agricultural community a certain industrial development.Bulgaria is not a country to which armies of occupation sre appropriate as means of enforcing payment.    %is can be much better done by occupying StaUv properties a .d taking over Customs, and for this en Administration Commission is the natural machinery.    It seems likely thtt such an Interallied Commission would contribute powerfully to tho preservation of Peace &amp;nd the promotion of Bulgaria1a prosperity as well as to securing due Reparation from Bulgaria.SUMMER,
