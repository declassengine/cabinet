tJUls Document is the Property of , His Britannic Malesty&apos;s Government.)From Viceroy, Foreign. Department, llth July 1919. (Received 12th, .1.1 a.m.)1016. Afghanistan. Following from Waziristan, dated 8th July:   &quot; Latest information from Khost appears to indicate that Nadir Khan is not even attempting to pretend to observe 4th clause of armistice terms. For example, when holding parade of 200 militia deserters at Matim, under ex-Subadar Gul Amir and ex Jemadar Saiyid Ahmad Miamai, on 5th July, he particularly impressed upon them when returning to Tochi they were to harass Government by attacking pickets and posts, cutting wires and water supplies, damaging roads; bridges, &amp;c. Same date similar instructions were given to Ri Khel deputation, Nadir Khan promising at the same time that he would advance after (? 10 days).&quot;Following from Baluchistan :  (1) Dated 9th July: &quot;Letter to my address received from Abdul Quddus on night of 8th July. Letter says that he has received order from Amir to withdraw to distance of 10 miles from battlefield. Abdul: Quddus comments on the fact that original British request was for withdrawal of 20 miles, and is grateful for recognition by British that original order would not be acceptable to him, and says that he would have been willing to (? die) to gain his purpose.&apos;,&apos;(2) Dated 9th July: &quot;Tribal situation now everywhere satisfactory. (?) Zais who- looted Melditar were caught by ( ? ) returning with loot and engaged, suffering casualties and losing large portion of loot. Guilty villages round Badinzai have been destroyed. Hasan Khel Sheranni most prominent in rising were engaged near Kapip and their leader Masho killed, since when tribe is reported split into mutually hostile factions. Militia deserters and rebellious tribesmen in hills above Hindu Bagh have been frightened by aeroplane attacks and retreated to border, Attack by bad characters from Shorawak upon Nushki Railway near Kishingi repulsed with reported loss to attackers. It is most satisfactory that all these successes were gained by our forces before Amirs order for withdrawal of his troops was received. These successes, combined with news of order for withdrawal, should now ensure quiet everywhere.&quot;Following from Peshawar dated 10th July: &quot;Political Agent, Wano, reports 8 hours, 10th July, that on night of 9th/ 1.0th a gang of 30 strong looted 10 Hindus and the mail tonga on the (? Dera Ismail Khan) road five miles from Tank. Tonga driver and two sepoy passengers, all Musulmans, were kidnapped, and tonga ponies stolen. Hindus state gang were Bhittanis. Donald reports from Han-gu that Mullah Mahmud, addressing a Feroze-Din Jirga, announced that he had received a letter from Amir to the following effect:  &quot;Government of India were beseeching the Amir to make peace, and had offered to restore his subsidy, and agreed to refrain from all punitive measures against trans-border tribes.&apos; &quot;
