There was great unrest in the Fleet at that time, amongst the men in connection with their pay, and the eituation was only controlled by the great de-votion to duty, the influence and&apos;tact, which the officers ** who, in many cases, were suffering far more from their inadequate pay than the men - exercised in controlling the situation. Various announcements have been male by the Admiralty from time to time that the natter of officers aspd their pay was bein  dealt with.     The C. in C of the Grand Fleet set up four committees of which the Grant Fleet Committees A and B. reported with great promptitude, and very clearly on the subject of pay of officers and men respectively.    Admiral Jerram&apos;s committee also exanined the state of affairs at the Home Ports and depots, and evidence taken by the Grand Fleet Committee was forwarded to him for examination and included in his report.     Admiral JerramJs Committee was only con-stituted to deal with the pay of men, and that was dealt with promptly.     But with regard to officers, instead of taking the report of the Grand Fleet A Committee ^ith certain modifications, a fresh committee was instituted by the Admiralty ^hich had to start again at the beginning and consider the whole question afresh.     The result of this was that though the Government decisions with regard to the pay of the men ^ere promulgated at the beginning of June, nothing so far has been published as to the Officers, though in answer to repeated questions, the reply has been, given that the matter is being dealt ^vith as speedily as possible.The contrast between the treatment of officers and men is mbst unfortunate, and is do ins very great bans to the Navy as a -^hole.     Furthermore, the delay in announcing the decisions of the Government has completely debarred ITaval Officers from any opportunity to bertefit by subscribing any increase in pay which they may receive to the Victory loan.It should also not be forgotten that the present position in regard to pay is entirely anomalous in bo much as a lieutenant of four years&apos; seniority is getting actually lese pay than the CP.0. and, of course, in the case of all, officers Junior to a lieutenant of fouryears&apos; seniority . the contrast and the anomalous position is all the more marked.
. Shirthermore,. an irapros;. ion is growing ::-aDon$si.t Jjaval Officers - that Is probably quite erroneous    that in so far as suDsistpnco and lodging.allowances will possibly be incrpascd,&apos;; this increase will not be dated back to the sanK3; date; as tho pay, and: that, -therefore, the longer . the&apos; question of pay is hold up the groat or loss thoy will Suffer. &apos;- Haying regard to. the foregoing,, we fool that wo cannot urge upon&apos;you too strongly tho extreme importance of the prompt set tie mont of this lo^i-g, overdue act of Justice, and wo earnestly invite you. to insist that immediate) decision upon it is oome to, -(5d. ) l\3.u. Adair,Hear admirala Ketired, Chairman of the ftavy Committee,(Sd. ) Curz on.Commande r, R. it. V. R,, Secretary.
