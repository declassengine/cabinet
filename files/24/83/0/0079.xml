Sootland House, 8.W.I.10th July, 1919.(Circulated by the Home Seoretary)THE CASSS OP. PHILIPS PRICE! AMD ROBERT MINORAooording to Reuter, Mr. M. Fhilips Prioe was detained by the German Authorities for four nights at the Moabit Prison, and was liberated only on oondition that he left Germany for a neutral oountry immediately.    Ehe &quot;Dally Herald&quot;, whose correspondent he is, the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and other papers have given some prominence to the faot of the detention.    Mr. Robert Minor is about to be tried by a Military Court at Coblenz.    According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of July 9th, he has been released.Philips Prioe first oame to notioe about the middle of 1917, when he wrote to the Rev. George Lewis that he was giving up relief work in the Caucasus to oome to Mosoow, where &quot;I am up to my neck in the revolutionary movement&quot;. He had gone out to Russia in the interest of the &quot;manchester Guardian&quot; in November, 1914.    In July, 1917* he wrote to A.J. Sherwin in Birmingham, &quot;When are you fellows in England going to follow the example of the Russians?&quot;He appears to have remained in PetrOgrad as a sort of unoffioial adviser to the Soviet Government for some months, for in the Autumn of 1918. the Dutoh Minister in Petrograd stated that Prioe was working at Mosoow in the Commissariat $ for Foreign Affairs on pro-Bolshevik propaganda, and also was preparing literature for issue to the Allied troops in the Worth calculated to spread sedition, and that he had already sent off radio messages, suggesting that the Allies had a hand in the murder of Uritsky and the attempt on Lenin,On/
On the 8th October, there was a Frees oable to the effeot that Price was openly working for the Bolsheviks, in drawi up a. Bolshevik proclamation addressed to British soldiers and sailors in the Worth, and on the   22nd November it was reported that it was intended to send him to England.    He le:ft Russia somewhere about this date, but went to Germany, and Mr. Arthur Hansome, who had Been a great deal of him in Petrograd, said that he had no intention of ooming to england.    He was at this time editing &quot;The Call&quot;, a Bolshevik newspaper, in Petrograd, and the attention of Mr. CP. scott, the Editor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; was oalled to the faot that in writing these articles he described himself as &quot;Correspondent of the &apos;manchester Guardian&apos;&quot;.    Mr. Scott called him to task for this, writing &quot;It does not do for you as our correspondent to be carrying on Bolshevik propaganda&quot;.Meanwhile, it was reported from the Murman front that propaganda leaflets had been dropped by aeroplane among our troops.    Specimens of these leaflets were afterwards received, and were sent to Cologne as part of the evidence against Robert Minor.    One of these leaflets was oouohed in rather Amerioan English and may have been the work of Minor; the other seems to be - aooording to the statement of Lieut, J. Habas of the American army - the joint work of the two.Among the subjeots of Allied oountries who were workint with the Bolsheviks was a oertain Captain Jacques Sadoul, a Prenoh oitizen, and in his dossier is a statement that the Central Exeoutive Committee in Bussia had deoided to send Sadoul, Price&apos; and an American to carry on Bolshevik propaganda on the Allied Western fronts.    This is dated th 13th February, 1919.    About this time, there were question! in.the House of Commons about ihilips Price, as it was thought/
thought he might be using his private means (he is a landowner in Gloucestershire) for Bolshevik propaganda.

On the 28th January, 1919, Price wrote to Mr. George Lansbury offering to send articles for the "new Labour Daily Newspaper" (obviously the &apos;Daily Herald&apos;);   he enclosed an article, defending the Terror in Russia.    In March, the Americans reported that he was with the Dusseldorf Spartacist Group, and, a Foreign Office telegram of the 14th stated that he was at Weimar, and that the Bavarian Central Soldiers&apos; Council had compelled two papers to publish some of his articles. He is the author of "Capitalist Europe and Socialist Russia", published by the British Socialist party in May, 1919; "The Truth about the Allied Intervention in Russia"; "Die Wahrheit uber die Intervention der Allierten in Russland", published by Promaohos-Verlag, Bern-Belp, 1918; and various articles in "The Call" and the "Dreadnought".

A few days ago Philips Price sent a manuscript, "The Truth about Soviet Russia", to Longuet for publication in the "Populaire".    It was much too long, and Longuet instructed his confidential secretary, Boris Souvirine, to send it to America, which has now been done. The  manuscript has come into my hands, and it proves to be a very verbose eulogy of the Soviet Government and all its works.

Souvirine stated that Price is the accredited Bolshevik representative, and has oredentials from Lenin.

On February 15th, 1919, Lieut. J. Habas of the American Army was sent to Dusseldorf, in order to investigate the Spartacist activities there. He found Dusseldorf under the control of the Spartacist Group. He asked one of the armed guards for the Bureau, and was introduced to a certain "Genosse", Thiel (Spartacist comrades call each other "Genosse"). Here he represented himself as a deserter from the/
the Amerioan Army, and was told that the beet service he ootdo for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat was propaganda, 1 that it was hie duty to go back to the Amerioan Army and do i propaganda work among his comrades. He was told to return i the evening, and in the meanwhile he was kept under I.observation.    At the next meeting, he was introduced to so J , of the leaders, who told him that his proper duty was to return to the American Army and distribute Pamphlets.    H* I lodged that night ^ith Seidel, who has Just been sentenced if Cologne.   Two days1 later, he met an JSnglishman and an Ameriol by appointment at 3eidel&apos;a of floe.   The one introduced himsei as Fhllips Price, a journalist and &quot;Bolshevik propaganda    j leader&quot;, and the other as an American, Minor, a cartoonist by profession, formerly on the staff of the &quot;Neil York Call&quot; (a revolutionary newspaper).. .tthis man said he had taken part in the oampaifen in favour of Thomas Mooney, the I.W.W. anarchist, and that In San FranoisoC he had been prominent iJ organising demonstrations against oonsoription.    He olainedl friendship with Berkaann and (toldmann, the anarohists.    He &quot;suggested that pamphlets be printed for the American troops; Minor himself volunteered to write the pamphlets and asked Lieut. Habas for information on oertain points.   A private meeting was then arranged to take plaoe at Habas&apos; hotel.Habas then had a long Interview with a woman Spartaoist named Pi lip, who told him that the Spartaoists already had pamphlets written by Price and Minor destined for the J3nglisi and Amerioan troops, that Frioe had translated into English oertain writings of Liebkneoht, and that he and Minor wereIworking on additional tracts and pamphlets, of which the titles were;-. &quot;Was will der Spartaousbund?&quot;; &quot;lienin&quot;; &quot;iSinBrief/
Brief an die amerikanisohen Arbeiter&quot;;   ana &quot;Die Wahrheit uber die Bolshewike&quot;.At 7*3P &quot;Urat evening, Minor, Price and tfabas met at the hotel.    Minor and Price told H&amp;bas that they h^d,been working together In Siberia, printing an Anglian newspaper for the Bolshevik oause. which they distributed through aviators among the American and British troops.    It was decided to distribute pamphlets among the Allied soldiers, not in barracks, but in small towns and billets.    Price and Minor added that they themselves might come over and take aotive oharge of the propaganda work among the Allied troops according to Lenin&quot;s direction, but for the present their hands were full.On the following morning, they met again at the Bureau. Minor took out a typewritten paper and said* &quot;I have it ready&quot;. He then handed the manusoript to Filip who had it printed. (a copy of this leaflet has been telegraphed for).iTHfl ftftKSSIP OF ROBERT MliW.On the 8th June, 1919, Robert Aiinor was arrested in Paxisby the Frenoh Polioe and handed over to the American MilitaryAuthorities in Coblenss.    According to Boris Souvirine, hehod called on Monsieur Longuet the day before his arrest and,in the course of conversation, protested against the distortionof his articles in tfce AmerioaivPress; for, whereas he w&amp;salways writing In defence of the Russian Soviet Government,his artioles were twisted into the opposite sense, and, as *  &apos;consequence, when Jrotsky received copies of the &quot;New YorkTimes&quot; he thought that Minor had betrayed the RussianBovemaent.    idinor also said that he had despatched a letterto Radek, the BolBhevik leader in Germany, by the hands of an american Y .u,0 .A* worker, explaining what had happened.    he wished it to be publicly known that he had never been atraitor to the Bolshevik cause.      At this interview he gaveLonguet/
Longuet an artiole on the Russian situation, ana this artiol has now been despatched by Souvirine to Ludwig Murtens, for publication in New York.    At the same time, a number of thel German Spartr,oists were arrested by the British Authorities in the Cologne area,.including Seidel.    Thone arrests were in consequence of .Lieut. Habas - report.    Mews has jv.r.t. bean received that several of these persons, ino-ttdJn*; Ceicu*l, ha been convicted on a charge of conspiracy to pause mutiny and sedition amongst the Allied Forces.Robert&apos;Minor was formerly cartoonist for the jfhilacielph: &quot;Publio Ledger&quot;.    He left Hew York on the 9th kay, 1918, be; known at that time as an extremist and a member of the I.WJJ A long artiole on &quot;What-happened in Russia&apos;-&apos; appeared in the issues, of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos; cf the 29th May, 2nd June and 5th June, which the &apos;Daily Herald&apos; describes as Ma sympathetj account of the History of Bolshevism&quot;.Pro&amp; a reliable souroe it is reported that when Minor Id America for Russia in Marohy 1918, he was acting for certain Indian Revolutionaries in California.It was understood that the authorities in Cologne consider thot they had suffioient evidence for putting irice snd Minoron their, trial for conspiracy with the German prisoners, and] that they proposed to ask the Germans to surrender 1/iinor. iJTom the. newspapers it appears thvit i&amp;norwrs arrested, but 4 liberated a few hours later on oondition that he left Germany A note dated the 4th July, states that it is quite poasl that Minor may be released, as strong pressure is being brou^ upon the military authorities from high American quarters.1charge of treason has. been brought against Minor, and the American Intelligence consider thst it oan be sustained;  the;are/
mi y. mare therefore mortified at the present state of the affair.It will thus be seen that though there may be a teohnioal difficulty in proving the oh&amp;rge of conspiracy between Philip^ Price, Robert Minor and the German, Seidel, to cause mutiny and aeoition among the Allied Forces, yet there is evidence to show thrt these three persons have been associated In such a conspiracy.A telegram      sent to Cologne on the 7th to the effeot that Prioe wus not required in England, and that it had been understood from former reports that there was sufficient evicenoe for putting him on his trial before a Court kartial in Cologne.B,H .0?.
