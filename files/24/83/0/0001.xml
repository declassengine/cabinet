This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^-Government.(Received 29th, II a.m.)&apos;.)! 1 S. Secret. Teheran telegram to London Foreign Office, No. 440, dated 23rd -June. We have repeated our Army telegram to you, No. 85(17, dated 23rd June, to Cox, with following remarks :  &quot;Government of India, in appreciating situation, took in actual fact comprehensive outlook you advocate. Possibility of retirement to Teheran, however, was rejected on following grounds :  (a) It would mean relinquishment of an organised line of communication for one totally unorganised ; (h) it would endanger the position of East Persia line of communication troops at most probable point of contact at critical period ; (c) its maintenance on Teheran road would be difficult in extreme, if not impossible, owing to distances involved and lack of sufficient available transport with North Persia Force; (J) Afghans are unlikely to be able to operate far from their border, and if forced to withdraw from Meshed, Malleson&apos;s force about Kain would be better placed to prevent an Afghan advance by threat of their flanks than on Teheran road ; (c) chances of Bolshevik invasion are not great, As regards reinforcement of Krasnovodsk, this has already been done to some extent, and is a question for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide.
