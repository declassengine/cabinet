m78This Document Is the Property of THE COAL INDUSTRY.dum by the President.of the Board of Trade.is important that the Cabinet should give an early -On on several questions arising1 out of the acceptance by His Maiesty&apos;s Government of the first San key Benort.   In view of the reduced output and increased cost of coal the matter has become urgent.(1) On the 6th June I circulated (G.T.7405) a draft Coal Mines (Control) Bill to carry cut the recommendations of the First Report of the Sankey Commission.    I recommended that the Bill should not be introduced until the receipt of the Second Report, dealing with Nationalization,   This has now been received, and a decision is desired whether the Bill should now proceed.(2) The ,future form. oLfloal, 0ontro 1.    The limitation of profits to the owners&quot;and thei guarantee of their profits will necessitate a much wider and more detailed system of control than that now existing, which was improvised for war purposes only.   I attach a memorandum by the Coal Controller (Annexe A) with which I am in general agreement.    I should be glad of authority to proceed with the reorganization of the Department on the lines suggested, without prejudice to the question whether it should or should not ultimately be constituted as an independent Ministry of Mines.(3) Method of dealing with the deficit on the working of the Coal Industry. -  Annexe B contains a note by the Coal Con-troller with&quot; tables attached on the subject of output.    The best estimate that can be given of the output of coal for the next 12 months is 215,000,000 tons.   The additional cost due to the reduced output and increased wages will result in a deficit at the rate of approximately  47,000,000 a year. Unless this is paid by the Exchequer, it will be necessary to raise the price of coal at the pit-head by about 4/6d. a ton.   A decision is necessary whether the deficit on the working of the coal industry shall be paid out of the. Exchequer or the price of coal raised to the consumer.(4) ExporttPolicy. -  If the same amount of coal is to be provided for inland con sumption and bunkers as in 1918 which was about 13,000,000 tons less than the average annual con-sumption of the five pre-T/ar years, not only must the present restrictions on consumption be maintained, out exports&quot;must be reduced by about 11 s000.000 tons a year below the 1918 figure, which was considerably less&apos;than half the figure for the pre-war year 1913.If it is decided to reduce exports, it is necessary to determine in what proportion the reduction should apply to foreign countries.    Having regard to the necessity ior maintaining our imports of raw materials, exports to Spain and Scandinavian ports should not be materially reduced.   Exports to Italy should remain at approximately the same quantities.-as in 1$18, and the principal reduction should take place in the quantity exported to Prance.
Tiie following table lias been prepared by the Coal Controller showing the quantities of coal exported to foreign countries in the Mrs 1913 arrd 19IS and the amounts to which it is proposed that those exports should now be reduced in tfach case:-Country.Fiance ItalySouth AmericaBunke ri rig S ta ticz^(Gibraltar etc. (Nor?/ aySwedenDenmarkSpainMscellaneous(i&amp;-, eluding Bunker-ing stations Germany, Baltic etc.)1913.1918.tons, 12,000,000 9,500,000 7,000,0001,000,000 4,500,000 3,000,000 2,500,000134,500,000Totals.75,000,000tons. 18,000,000 4,000,000 750,0003,000,000 1,250,000 1,000,000 1,000,000 1,500,0003.500,00034,000,000After July, 1919.cons, 9.000,000 4,000,000800,0003,000,000 1^000,000 2:000,000 1)000,000 1,000,0001,000,000; 800,ooosnot accurately known(5) Carriage of Coal Coastwise. - The diversion to inland consumption of coal previously exported raises the question how far this will have to be met By the use of coastwise traffic^ Unless this is done, the&apos;strain on the railways must be intensified.  Carriage by sea will however seriously increase the cost of coal to the consumer&apos;in those districts whichwill be dependent on sea-borne coal, unless the control of shipping is maintained and shipping requisitioned for the purpose.A.C.geddes. 3.7.19.
A N K 1 X       A.BOTE by the Coal Controller.Permanent Organisation for control of Coal Mines,.The coal Minos Department is at present a purely temporary organisation, attached to the Board of Trade, and the Staff is comprised in the main of administrative Officers and clerks borrowed from the Railway Companies and business houses and of volunteers who have placed their servioes at the disposal of the Department during the period of the war.       The Department is now going through a process of disintegration - the volunteer officers cannot be expected to extend their services indefinitely, while the loaned officers are now required to be returnsd to the sources from which they were temporarily borrowed.It is, I submit * imperative, that, in view of the new position created by the Interim Keport of the Coal , Industry Commission, the Department should bo reorganised on a permanent basis at once.       Whether it be subsequently determined by the Government to purchase the mines or not, the measures of control necessary in any event will be, to all intents and purposes, almost equal in magnitude, and with the exception of the actual direct employment of labour, the control will in all other respects cover the whole of the working of the oo&amp;l industry.   Further, the re-organisation of the administration of the control should be so arranged that the reconstituted Department would, with slight re-adt1uatment, be in readiness if need be to take over the whole of the duties of a Ministry of Mines * iii this connection it is particularly desirable that the future status of the Department should be definitely settled as $coin as possible.a re-organisation of the Department -on permanent lines as recommended will provide Ah opportunity for improvement in the co-ordination of the work of $no several Divisions and in tho internal administration of the Office.       I should recommend, in this connection, that the services of oapable and experiences: Civil Servants, with a knowledge of Government and Departmental procedure should be obtained; sad ao doubt tho Treasury &quot;Pool&quot; would be available from which tho permanent staff necessary for building up of an efficient organisation, oould be drawn. While tho Coal Minos Department remains on a temporary footing any oxtensive changes arc impracticable, but I most strongly urge tho desirability of taking in hand without delay tho settlement of tho future status of tho Control Department and its establishment upon a permanent basis.      as seoa as those questions are seeided I shall bo glad to work out a considered scheme for providing adequate machinery for the purposes of tho control.e.D.J.7-5-1919.
Coal Mines Department, * 3rd June, 1919.The following information is supplied as regards output, etc., of coal based on the latest information obtainable.The output for the first 20 weeks of l&apos;-)19 was at the rate of 242,OCQt4fcX) tons per annum as compared with 2*^,000,000 tons in 1913,The average number of men e-iployed during the 20 weeks was 1,ill, ))0, being exactly the sane number as the average employed during the year 1913.The average weekly output for the four weeks ending the 24th May,1919 during which period there were no holidays and few stoppages, was 4,813,000 ton;-, or at the rate of, s^y, 238,000,000 tons per annum after allowing 5,&apos;. for holidays And stoppages.The average weekly output of the six weeks ending the 15th March, during /hich conditions were fairly normal (with no holidays and few strikes or stoppages);   the average output for the four weeks ending the 24th lay when similar conditions pre-prevailed and the Sankey wage was in operation; and the average number of persons employed in the respective periods are as follows6 weeks ending March 15th4 weeks ending May 24thAverage number of persons employedAverage output per week Output per man per week Output per actual man shifti,031,OHO   1,124,000 4,352,000   4,813,000 i% 15 4.3.92.90The percentage of absenteeism rtue to sickness, injury and voluntary absence, shorn as a percentage of the po;- &quot;ible
number of shifts whioh could have been work M., increased from an average of 10.7/, in 1913 to an average of 12.5$ in tie first 20 weeks of 1910, and to an average of 13,.   in the four weeks ending the 24th May,The average number of days per week on which pits raised coal decreased, from 5.53 in 1913 to 5.20 in the first 20 weeks of 1919.The average output per man per period, of four weeks decreased from 19.0 tons in 1913 to 16.3 tons in the first 20 weeks of 1919, and 17.1 tons in the four weeks ending the 24th Hay, during -Men period there were no holidays and few stoppages.The average output per actual man shift worked  *as 1 ton for the year&apos;1913, .89 of a ton for the first 20 weeks of 1919 and. .90 of a ton for the four weeks ending the 24th May.The estimated output for the year 1919 on the basis of the average weekly output of the first 20 weeks, and allowing for the reduced hours after the 16th July is, say 230,000,000 tons, or calculated on the weekly output for the first 20 weeks, the output for the remainder of the year being estimated on the average weekly output for the four weeks ending the 24th May, with an allowance of 5.0 for holidays and stoppages, say, 223,000,000 tons.The estimated output for 12 months from July 1919 after the reduced hours have come into force is, say, 217,000,000 tons calculated on the output of the firs1- 20 weeks, or, say, 214,000,000 tons calculated on the weekly output of the four weeks ending the 24th May 1919, with an allowance of 5/* for holidays and stoppages.The consumption of coal for inland purpose&apos;;-. and bunkers was 210,000,000 tons in the year 1913 (the average for the five pre-war y..ars was 209,000,000 tons) and for the year 1913 was 196,000,OX) tons.
The exports of - coal in the year 191&apos;* were 7.7,o;v.),000 tons, and in the year 1918, 34,0)0,000 tons.     In order to provide approximately the same quantity of coal for inland consumption and bunkers for 12 months from July 1919, all present restric-tions on consumption nust be fully maintained, antf in addition exports must be reduced from a rate of 34,&apos;-00,000 tons per annum to a rate of 23,000^000 tons per annum.It is estimated that the deficiency on the working of the industry or; the basis of the estimated outputs given for the period of 12 months from July next, after providing for the guaranteed&apos; profits to Owners at the rate of l/2 per ton, will be about  43,600,000 equal to 4/3 per ton of output.     For the calendar year 1919 it is estimated that the deficiency will be  37,000,000.Seven Schedules have been prepared setting out the details on which the conclusions contained in thisXemoran^um are based.

It is proposed to replace these necessary stocks in 1919 and the coal available-ble for actual consumption in 1919 is therefore less than the actual .output less exports.E.D.JONES.3rd June, 1919.
r(89The profit of  54,000,000 estimated In the Interim Sankey Report for the current year was arrived at toy assuming an out-put of 264,000,000 tons for the year 1919 (on the basis of the present working-hour-day) at a profit of 4/ld. per ton.The profit of 4/ld, per ton was based on an ascertained profit of 3/7df per ton for the quarter ended 30th September, 1918, increased by 6d. as an additional ton-profit arising out of the reduction in overhead charges following an increased out-put, after allowing for the wages of the additional men.The following estimate is also based on the ascertained profit of 3/7d* per ton in relation to the putput as now estima-ted droa* a period of 12 months from the 16th July 1919, which is the date on which the shortening of the working day by one hour comes into operation.Ascertained profit for the quarter ended 30th September 1918 on the basis of an output at the rate of 228,000,000 tons per annum, the average number of persons em-ployed being 961,000Deduct for wages of 163,000 additional persons employed at the pre-Sankey rate (an average of (say)  3 per week) . 489,000 x 52(iitB.
