PBICE OF KAY AKD TO&apos;ffi SbTHJES,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Considerable anxiety is being caused by the Hay position, and I have come to the conclusion that some action on the part of the Government will be necessary,, aa the outlook has been materially altered for the worse by the failure of the hay crop in many parts of the country.Broadly stated, the position is as follows in England and Wales-:-Prior to the war, the crop was about 8 million tons and the imports were relatively small-    Last year the crop was about oil million tons.    It is estimated that this year it will be about 6 million tons, and there is no reserve,    When it-is added that last year, though Hay was being.commandeered, as much as 5-V million tons was retained on farms for the feeding of stock, it will be realised that unless something is done., great scarcity is to be expected in the towns,I recommend the following course of action:-1*    That tho Central Council should be at once instruc-ted to purchase Kay on behalf of the Government, on terms to be agreed to by the Board of Trade, and under-take its distribution w .en required.The Central Council and its local organisations have been the medium of distribution since last Sontern-ber and its work has been most satisfactorily performed,Z0    That the Board of Trade should be authorised, in consultation with the Board of Agriculture, to impose -  maximum, selling ard buying prices for liay as soon as the.Board, of Trade think it advisable to ao so.3.    That the Beard of Trade should make arrangements, as they found it advisable, for the importation of Hay on Government account,, provided that no, subsidy is involved,,
4.. That power to coranandeer Ha? should be retained, but every effort be made to avoid exercising it.It is easier to prevent excessive prices and town scarcity than to dee! with them when they have appear eel:  and, the social and economic con-sequences of their appearance might be most serioust in View particularly of the present transport diffi-culties and cf the state of feeling in the country.The chief points of the scheme which I now propose to the Cabinet are (a) that any less to the Treasury is unlikely;   (b) that no restraint is to be imposed on private buying, beyond its being subject to maxim-am prices;   (c) that commandeering will probably be avoided or, at the worst, exercised only to a limited extent. The scheme is likely to be far more acceptable to agri-cultural interests than the one that lias been in opera-tion up to the present.The decision of the Cabinet is asked for.A,C.
