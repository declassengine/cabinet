Scotland House, S.W.1. 8peolal:-Ren6rt-KoT ^ : 14th July, 1919&quot;THE RUSSIAN SOv*j.et BUREAU IN - .   &apos; - tjn1tkd &apos;,smss,&apos;. ;        . ;    .(Cirottlated by the Home Secretary)&apos;The raid which wa,e, made on the office of the Russian Soviet Bureau, 110 West 40th Street, New York, on the 12th of June by the Committee of Inquiry of the State of New York,, and resulted in the seizure of a large quantity of correspondence and literature, makes it possible to give some account of this organization and of the nature of its work in the United States.At the time the raid was mde, subpoenas, were served upon Martens, Weinatein, Heller,&apos; Hourwioh and Nuor^eva. the prinoipal offiolala of the Bureau.&apos; \ They were taken to the City Hall where the interrogation&apos;of Gartens and Heller was begun.   It was designed to prove&apos;that the Soviet Bureau was 1       using funds to oiroulate Bolshevik propaganda in the UnitedSteves. :       .j&amp;irtens has entrusted his defe^nqe to the notorious Charles Hecht and Walter Neilesy who.is prominent in.the - Civil Liberties Bureau; euid was one..of the attorneys for the &quot;American Socialist Society&quot;,which was oonvioted under the Espionage Act for publishing a seditious book by scott Hearing.A.&apos; list of the personnel of the Bureau is attached to . this report. WV;; v*,  ,QOiBBVlClAL PROKiflANDA. BY W BURSAU.The Bureau wr^s established-by L.C,A.K. Gartens, whoclaims/1  s-t t     ,* -.&apos;    r
oiaims to b$ tho representative in America of the Russian1Soviet Government, in the spring of thia year, and the^ivenostensible reason/for its foundation was the desire of the Russian Soviet Government to establish trade relctions between the United States ,and Iluaeia,   On the 8th of April, A.A. Heller, a member of the offioial Socialist Party in :\america - one of the three members of the General fixeoutive Committee of the Forty, the headquarters of whioh is at Chicago - who is in oharge of the Commercial branoh of the Bureau, issued a statement to the press in whioh he emphasised the fact that Russia was xn need of maohinery of every description, railway material, shoes, olothiz^, drugs, chemicals, &quot;and a thousand and one other things whioh are made in America and can be used by oivilized communities&quot;.  He went on to say that the Russian Soviet Government proposed to pay for its purchases in a manner whioh would make the trade independent of the depreoioted value of the rouble; that it we prepared to plaoe $200,000,000 in gold in banks abroad as soon as trade relations were established; and that there were large stores of raw material In Bussia such as furs, flax, hemp, hides, platinum, preoious stones, etc, the value of whioh would go towards balanoing the imports into Busaia.every   effort was made from the first by Martens and his associates to arouse the interest of American capitalists and there are grounds for believing that the Bureau has received finanoial support from some Russian export firms, as well as from the Guarantee Trust Company, although this firm has deni the allegation that it is finanoing Martens-1&apos; organization. The efforts of the Bureau to promote trade with Russia were sijnotorious that on the 7th of May the State Department issued an oxpXicit repudiation of Martens and the Bolshevik Goveronewhioh/
whioh he claimed to represent,  Jta spite of this, however,, the oommeroial department of the Burtf.au oontinued itsI ........ , * *advertisement of trade facilities .and appears to have had a certain amount of success in attracting customers. -Among the documents seizsd v/hen the offices of the Bureau were raided there wera many letters addressed to, and reoeived from, business firms.   -The Bureau S9nt invitation oiroulars wholesale and reoeived hundreds of replies:,,, More tftan   -half of these were refusals, but many traders expressed their willingness to do business. FINANCIAL RB80DB0ES. 0? THS BUPffAUBut, although undoubtedly one of the. main purposes for whioh the Bureau was founded was to open up a market betveen Russia and the United Rtates, and so indirectly to influence the American people in favour bf the Soviet Government, it is tolerably clear that t-h:&apos;. i fcaa only a part of the work for whioh it was establiahod,   All tho evidence which has been obtained goes to prove that Martens has considerable sums of money at his disposal, and that he and his associates are engaged in the active work of propaganda and are in touoh with the Bolshevik agitation whioh emanates from Petrograd. About four weeks before the raid on tho Bureau, he received a large sum whioh was brought to him by a person who left JF-petrograd early in *pril and he had in his possession about the middle of June the equivalent of almost fivo million roubles in oaeh.   The monthly-rent of his offioes is more them  300 and&apos; his weekly pay bill is about $1000.   Tho Bureau has accounts at several banks, but these deposits do not exceed a few thousand dollars and it is ole;-,r, therefore, that ijiartenskeeps the buBc of hi-s aioney in a private safe o,r in a safe-deposit box.OQNNfiCTION/
CONNECTION WITH THE LEFT WING

The accounts of the Bureau shew that considerable payment are made to "The  Ellore", the newspaper of the Hungarian Left Wing, which indeed appears to be largely financed by the Bureau. This is a clear point of contact between Martens and the Left Wing of the Party. His ostensible method of conducting his work on ordinary business lines and not in the usual revolutionary Socialistic manner has, however, displea? the rank and file of this branch of the Party. The bestowal of lucrative appointments in the Bureau upon orthodox Socialists and pacifists, like Heller and Evans Clark, may have had something to do with this. No doubt the Extremists who were not in the secrets of their party felt that they were being cheated of the spoils and at the end of April certain of them talked about repudiating the authority of the Bureau. Martens&apos; independence has also brought him into collision with the New York City Committee of the Russian Federation.   As th? representative of Lenin and Trotsky, he refuses to recognise the authority of the Federation and has appointed as officers in the Bureau persons who have been expelled from the Federation for disobedience. On the 10th of May, a meeting of the New York Committee of the Federation was held at which Martens was bitterly attacked and a decision was made to bring forward the subject of Martens&apos; appointments at the next general meeting of the Federation. This quarrel may lead to interesting developments.

In spite of these family troubles, there is no doubt that Martens is in close touch with the real leaders of the Left Wing - such as John Reed and Ludwig Lore - and a cursory inspection of the documents seized at the office of the Bureau reveals certain interesting connections between Martens and ? secretary, Nuorteva, the self-styled Ambassador to the United States of the Finnish Republic, with members of the Left Wing. (1)/
(1) $hero was an Intrigue $foot about the time thePresident first went to France to get the Administration to use Nuorteva as an intermediary &apos; with the Russian Soviet Government, with a view to bring about its recognition by America.   Endeavour- was made to bring Colonel House into it, and th6re is a long and interesting letter to Frederick C Howe, on whose support and sympathy Nuorteva appeared to rely.   There are other records aonneot-ing Howe with Martens and Nuorteva,(2) There is a file of correspondence WithJEugene Debs.(3) A letter from Amos Pinchot to William Kent of .the U.8. Tariff Commission in an envelope addressed to Senator Lenroot, introduces Evans Clark &quot;now in the Bureau of the Russian Soviet Republic.&quot;   &quot;He wants to talk with you about the recognition of kolchak and the raising of the blockade, etc,1&apos;(4) a report to Felix frankfurter, dated 2?th May,1919, speaks of the virulent campaign vilifying the Hussion Government.(5) There is considerable correspondenoe between aColonel and Mrs. Raymond Robbins and Nuorteva, both in 1918 and 1919.   In July, 1918, Ivlrs. Robbins asked Nuorteva for artioles for &quot;Life and Labour&quot;, the organ of the National Women&apos;s Trade League,   In February and toasjoh, 1919, Nuorteva trie4^ through Robbins, to get invited to give evidence before the Overman Committee.   He also wanted Robbins to denounoe the Sissons d/jouments.(6) In a letter from the Hanaen Cloth ProduceCompany, New York, to Nuorteva, dated March 30th, 1918, E. Werner Khudsen says that he under atan is&quot; -that Nuorteva intends to make arrangements for the export of food-stuffs through Finland, and he offers- his services.   We have a file on Khudsen, who passed information to and from Germany by way of Mexioo- with regard to British shipping.The files of the Bureau shew that the Soviet organization is in touch with the several firms and radioals in Canada.There is also a request from Gale&apos;s Magazine asking for finenoial assistance in the work of propaganda upon whioh Gale is engaged among the Hindus in Mexioo.   There are only a few papers dealing with Irish affairs, but there are indioations of the increasingly olose oonneotion which exists between the Russian and Irish revolutions.   It is interesting to note that Harry J. Boland visited the Bureau almost immediately after his arrival in New York and that Martens has had a longinterview/
interview with Dr. Madge C.L. McGuinness, who is a socialist and devoted to the Irish cause, and Dr. Gertrude B. Kelly, who is the leader of the Cum-na-Bhan, the Women&apos;s Branch of the Clan-Na-Gael.

PRESS PROPAGANDA BY THE BUREAU

The active propaganda of the Bureau is being carried out by means of articles in the American press, by its own newspaper called "Soviet Russia", which is issued by the Bureau, and by lectures and public meetings.

The "New York Call" is the American newspaper which Martens mainly employs for his propaganda. This is generally directed to refuting promptly any charges brought against the Russian Soviet Government and to advertising the commercial possibility in Russia. The prospect of the recognition of Kolchak by the Allies probably led to the production by the Bureau of "Soviet Russia" for which Martens is said to be anxious to obtain article by Sylvia Pankhurst.

The Bolshevik party in America was thoroughly alarmed when the question of the recognition of Kolchak was first mooted, and Martens admitted that the party would neglect no means to prevent it and that he was prepared to spend millions in the work of propaganda.  Martens, Nuorteva, Weinstein and Hartman are organizing a vigorous campaign against kolchak and are directing especial attention to combating the influence of Sa? paper "Struggling Russia". The importance which the Bolshev? attach to the recognition question is proved by a letter recently sent by Andre Courland to Jean Longuet in Paris in which he says:-  "La propagonde en faveur de kolchak bat son plein et promet d&apos;etre une des plus dangereuses que nous avon? connue jusqu&apos;ici."  Courland, although not entirely in the confidence of Martens, is on friendly terms with him and constantly visits the Bureau.

In/
. In,addition to its. newspaper propaganda, the Bureau has an-Information br,anoh vnioh sends out agents to distribute its literature. , These agents are   supplied with oredontials and, are foroing the Russians in America to buy books, and pamphlets.   In case any one refuses to buy them, &apos; - -&apos;, he is,:told that he will not be allowed to return to Russia ::&quot;   or that, if he does succeed in entering tho country, his money will be confiscated by the Government.    There is also evidence to shew that agents with these books and pamphlets are being oont to the East,    In this conneotion it is ,      interesting to note that Mrs, Nora C. Smitheman is working for the Bureau.    She is well known in Radical oiroles and has taken an active part in the intirigues of the Hindu agitators in New York.    She is a oiose friend of Agnes Smedlcy,who was living with her a short time ago, and of Lajpat Rat, and she is a member of the JSxeoutive Committee of the &quot;Friends of Froodom in India&quot;,GENERAL SCOPE OF THE BUREAU;3 ACTIVITIES,Until a more oomplete investigation has boon made of tho documents seized at the Bureau and the inquiry by the Committee of Inquiry of the State of New Yoic-k has been oompleted, it is not possible to state definitely the full scope of tho work whioh is being done by Martens and his associates.   There is little doubt, however, that they are oonduobing aotivo Bolshevik propaganda throughout the United States and are in close touch with the Left Wing in Canada and with the extremists in the East,    The commercial activity of the Bureau, whioh is in itself an insidious form of propaganda, is no doubt intended to oover more illioit methods of furthering the Bolshevik cause.    So far, nooonneotion/
oonneotion with, any&apos; of the? more violent outbursts of this propaganda has been traoed to the Bureau, and Martens has been quiok to dissociate himself with the perpetrators of any outrage.    He denounced the bomb outrage of the Jni of June . * as &quot;the work of dirty bands.aiming to soare.the.publio and vv* to oause Congress to enaot oppressive laws against all liberals&quot;.  His polioy. is olearly to oarry on his work within-the law and it is unlikely, therefore, that his examination will reveal a criminal oonspir^oy.   He has also denied all oonneotion with the Russian an/a-chist headquarters at 133, Bast l$th Stroot,   at the acua time, his intimate association with so many of the Extremist leaders,and the use whioh he makes of financial resources in his possession, make it tolerably 0/0?.,r that his organization is a powerful weapon for supporting the&apos;Bolshevik oause in the United State and th&apos;.vt he is in close touch with the promoters of.political unrest throughout the wholo .unerican continent,
