S DOCUMHT IS Tj-F P^QprqTy, C&apos;&apos; HIS ST:!; *?:?uc,,ma j?b?vi,n fiCV^iu^i,^.C RUT., 7686.WAR OABIFTff. THE DISTRIBUTION OF WAR irDALS.i  / ( Memorandum by Sir   Fredrick PonsonbyAAn Inter-Departmental committee composed of representa-tives cf the Admiralty, V/ar office, Air Ministry, Ministry of Munitions, Treasury, Rome Office, Colonial office, Board of Trade,. India office, Royal Mint, Red Cross and Foreign Office, with Sir Frederick ponsonby as chairman was appointed to con-sicier all the problems involved in granting medals for opera-tions during the wr\r and to devise a scheme of distribution that would apply equally well to all theatres of war and all parts of the British empire....   After considering innumerable proposals the Committee put forward a scheme,  the main features of which were \*(a) That there should be two medals,  the British -far Medal and the Victory Medal (the Allies Medal)(b) That the British Var Medal should be given to every gazetted officer and enlisted man in the three services no matter where he had served.(c) That the Victory Medal should be restricted to men in the Navy who had been afloat on duty and to men in the Army who had.entered a theatre of war.(d) A War Worker&apos;s Medal was found to be an impossi-bility.(e) That there should be a Mercantile Marine Jrie&amp;ai.(f) That women should be dealt with on precisely the same lines as men.After this scheme had received the approval of all the Government departments concerned, it was telegraphed to the Dominion Governments and was finally accepted by them.     At the end of May the scheme was forwarded for the approval of the War Cabinet but in the meantime the Secretary of State was not satisfied that it was the best possible scheme,   At a meeting of the Com ittee which he attended, the proposal to give a general service medal to all troops at home&apos;was discussed a second time but was again&quot; found to be imprac-ticable.   The Secretary of state for &quot;ai after hearing the discussion came to the conclusion that the fairest plan to all concerned would be to ?:ive no medals at all to those who had not left their native shores,   &quot;hen he subsequently wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty ana put forward this proposal, the &quot;irst Lord did not concur and wishea to adhere to the original scheme.   After some correspondence, it was proposed that the two services should act independ-ently and each have its own scheme.quite apart from the unnecessary confusion that this proposal would create it is evident that the scheme with the widest distribution must eventually be adopted by both services.   The question is therefore submitted for the consideration of the T7ar Cabinet.
