DIRECTORATE of INTELLIGENCE. SPECIAL REPORT No. 3.Indian and Egyptian Conspirators in England,and the Remedy.The native unrest in India and Egypt is merely a phase of movements which began many years, ago. The purpose of this Eeport is to show that these two movements, if not actually directed by natives living in England, draw their inspiration from such persons, and that the impunity with which Indians and Egyptians can hatch revolution at the centre of the Empire re-acts very unfavourably upon the loyalty of the Egyptians and Indians and may culminate in the commission of outrages in England itself.INDIA.1. Before we consider the present position of the Egyptian Community in England, it will be instructive to review very briefly the course which the Indian Revolutionary Movement has followed.THE BEGINNING.2. The first indication of a modern revolutionary movement dates from the Anti-Moham-medan movement in Bombay City in 1893. In .1894 was formed a &quot; Society for the removal of obstacles to the Hindu religion &quot; which included physical and military training.In 1897, following on an article in Tilak&apos;s Marathi paper the Kesari, imputing to the government of India a deliberate direction to oppress the people in the measures taken to combat the plague, Mr. Band, the Plague Commissioner, was assassinated. From 1898 to 1906 the Kesari, without exceeding the limits of reasonable criticism, grew steadily in popularity and influence. Another Marathi weekly paper at this period gained notice on account of its. seditious tone and its editor was finally sentenced to nineteen months&apos; imprisonment in 1908.KRISHNAVARMA AND INDIA HOUSE.3. Toward the end of 1897 Krishnavarma, a native of Kathiainar in Western India, came from Bombay to London in connection with the arrests made in the Rand Murder. He lived in obscurity till 1905 when he founded the &quot; India Home Bule Society &quot; and issued the Indian Sociologist, in which he describes the Society as having the object of securing Home Eule for India and carrying on a genuine Indian propaganda in England by all practicable means. La 1907 Krishnavarma left London for Paris. The printer of the Indian Sociologist having been twice convicted in 1909, this paper was printed in Paris, though touch was maintained with &quot; India House &quot; in London.4. In 1908 there occurred in India the bomb outrage in which Mrs. and Miss Kennedy lost their lives.5. In the May of the same year a celebration of the Indian Mutiny at the &quot; India House &quot; was attended by nearly 100 Indian students from all parts of the United Kingdom. In this year also the policy of. assassinations was advocated at regular Sunday meetings at the &quot; India House &quot; and a lecture on the making of bombs was delivered by a Hindu student.6. In 1909 members of the &quot; India House &quot; began to practise revolver shooting at a range in London, and on the 1st July Colonel Sir W. C. Wyllie was assassinated by one of the young men connected with it. At this period the &quot; India House &quot; gang were despatching by post to India typed copies of a work dealing with the preparation of bombs for anarchist purposes. In 191.4 were discovered in Poona highly inflammatory leaflets signed &quot; Bengal Revolutionaries.&quot;7. The murder of Mr. Jackson in 1909 brought out the fact that the Indian plotters in Paris had furnished the pistols with which the murderers were armed.
PARTITION OP BENGAL.8. The movement in Bengal, started in 1902 by Barindra Kumar Ghosh from Baroda, had as its object the overturning the Britisli Government by violent means, and Barindra devoted himself to working among the English educated class to which he belonged. His brother had been educated in England and he himself was born there.9.  The partition of Bengal in 1905 was made the excuse for an agitation of great bitterness, which was of Hindu origin and drew its strength from the educated classes.  At this time the    A boycott of English goods was also instituted.10. Barindra&apos;s method was to combine the cause of independence with physical culture. For this purpose he chose to work among schoolboys, to instil into them the craving for inde-pendence, to form secret societies and to collect arms and ammunition against the time for rebellion..11. Bevolutionary crime developed rapidly. In 1907 we find attempts to blow up the train of the Lieutenant-Governor and an attempt was made upon the life of the District Magistrate of Dacca..12. In 1908 a bomb was thrown into the house of the Maire of Ohandernagore. Two English ladies were assassinated by a bomb while driving&apos;, and the Police came on to the track of bombs, dynamite and cartridges intended for further outrages. Prom then onwards political dacoities in Bengal became of fairly common occurrence. Whilst in many cases the revolu-tionaries aimed at terrorising the servants of the Government and those who had stood by the Government as informers by assassination, we find that in some cases the object seems to have been sheer love of murder.THE PUNJAB.13. In 1907 anti-English propaganda began to be openly preached in the Punjab. Certain leaders were deported, but the respite was only temporary, and the stream of seditious literature continued to pour forth. Here again it was the Western-educated agitator in this case Hardayal who had been to Oxford and held a State Scholarship. Under his leadership a general boycott and passive resistance movement was organized at Lahore, in order to paralyze British rule. Hardayal left India in 1911. and established himself at San Francisco, where he started the notorious revolutionary newspaper Ghadr (Mutiny).14. An extract from a report by the Punjab Government is highly significant. It says ignorant Sikh peasants who have been indoctrinated with crude ideas of equality and democracy in America and led to believe by Hardayal and his co-workers that India can be made into a Utopia in which all will be equal, and plague and famine cease to exist by the simple expedient of driving out the British.&quot; The Ghadr movement in the Punjab came very near to causing widespread bloodshed.  We know now that Hardayal was connected with India House.GEEMANS AND&apos;THE GHADE.15.  When war broke out the Germans were quick to turn Hardayal and his revolutionary party to their advantage and to pay for Indian agents to be sent to Afghanistan and Siam.16.  Hardayal went to Berlin early in the war, and was used to corrupt the loyalty of native Indian prisoners of war.17. In Madras a Bengali journalist, Bepin Chandra Pal, started an agitation which resulted in the shooting of the District Magistrate of Tinnevelly in 1911. In this year too Madame Cama&apos;s paper the Bande Mataram was published in Paris. Bepin Chandra Pal has visited England and been prominent in the agitation in Europe as well as in India. His son, Mranjan Pal, is still in England.THE MAHOMMEDANS.18. Turning now to the Mahommedan population of India, one-fifth of the whole, we find that pan-Islamic agitation had been aroused by the Italian-Turkish war and the events that followed in the Balkans. With the declaration of war with Turkey in 1914 a great strain was put on zealous Muslims and on the whole much credit .is due to the Indian Muslims for their loyalty, but among them there was a small and vaguely defined group of fanatical Muslims who desired to substitute a new Islamic Empire for British rule in India. The methods adopted by this extreme party range from secret intrigue and propaganda to open defection. There can be no doubt that the Turkish Committee of Union and Progress, which was formed at the beginning of the century, was behind this movement. To overthrow British rule in India these revolutionaries will ally themselves with any of our enemies the Hindu revolutionary, the German emissary, the &quot; Young Turk Party,&quot; the Bolshevist, and or extreme Socialist party ^ which they think will embarrass the British Government.
19. No apology is needed for dealing at some length with the Hindu side of the Seditionist movement in India, for, at the present time, the two revolutionary parties, in their common hatred of Great Britain, are making common cause. The lesson which was learned from the Hindu Seditionists must not be forgotten in dealing with the Muslim question. One fact stands out prominently that when poisonous literature is allowed to circulate, uncritical and impres-sionable youths are the first to catch the infection. The leaders of the movement were far-seeing when they chose the young mind of India as the field to sow their seed the very mentality of the Oriental makes him fertile soil.20. The following is an extract from Political Trouble in India 1907-1917, by J. C. Kerr,. 1.8.0., published in India :&quot; Arrival of Indian leaders.&quot; In the autumn of 1908, as the result of the prosecution of Tilak and others for sedition and of the approaching announcement by the Secretary of State of the scheme for reform of the Indian Administration, a number of prominent agitators left India for London, and the India House naturally formed a convenient centre for meeting and in some cases a place of residence. G. 8. Khaparde of Amraoti, Lajpat Bai, Hardayal and Earn Bhaj Dutt from the Punjab, and B. C. Pal of Calcutta, all left India in August and arrived in London in September 1908.&quot; Open rebellion advocated.&quot;Towards the end of 1908 there was a marked increase in the truculence of the Young India party who greeted with jeers and groans any counsels of moderation put forward by the so-called leaders. The party of violence was headed by Savarkar, who lectured on November 8th on the subject, &apos; Are we really disarmed.&apos; He pointed out that in spite of the Arms Act there was plenty of warlike material in India. He instanced the Native States and Native Troops which he said would be sufficient to overpower and drive the English out of India. What was wanted Avas active work in the Native States and among the native troops, and it would be the duty of every Indian leaving these shores for India to work in that direction. The advent of the bomb had terrified the British public, &apos; We must teach our people to hate the foreign oppressor-and success is sure.&apos; &quot;THE EESPONSIBILITY OP INDIANS  IN ENGLAND.21. It will thus be apparent what an important part in the Indian revolutionary movement has been played by leaders working out of India and particularly in London. The assassination of Sir Curzon Wyllie in 1909 was followed by the closing down of all the clubs and societies centering round &quot; India House,&quot; but since that time numerous other organisations have come into existence, old ones have been revived or transformed, and there has been an intensive propaganda among the Indian community during the Avar, which has increased rather than diminished since the Armistice. The result is the sad but undoubted fact that a large majority of the Indians (both Hindu and Mohammedan) who come to this country for training and education go back home strongly imbued with anti-British sentiments of a racial or religious nature. The process is more rapid now that influential persons such as Lady De La Warr, George Lansbury, and others, are conducting an agitation for Home Rule for India and imbuing the Indians with the idea that there is a Large body of support for their extreme views in this country. These men form the back-bone of the &quot; politically-minded &quot; classes in India, and the lamentable conclusion must be drawn that the source of the movement for the secession of India from the British Empire is to be found in the metropolis of that Empire itself.22. A point which has been very noticeable throughout the Indian Seditionist Movement has been the nature of the articles in the press, the under-current of suggestion which lies in them most difficult to deal with and most harmful. The Indian Seditionists have a centre in Paris from which their propaganda is directed. They are in connection with the Moslems of the extreme type, who, as mentioned previously, have a headquarters in that city also.23. The following notes taken from secret reports of the proceedings of meetings of the various societies now at work in London are typical of the spirit which prevails and show what a short step is still required before, as in the case of the East Indian Societies in London in 1909, direct incitements to physical violence are made.(1) At a meeting of the &quot; Cercle d&apos;Etudes Ethnographiques &quot; on 24.1.18, Ehsan el Bakry condemned the Armenians in strong terms and said he would rather live under Turkish than under British rule.(2) It is significant that at a meeting of Indians at the Essex Hall on 12.5.19, a resolution regarding the Caliphate and the sacred places of Islam was moved by the Hindu Nationalist Tilak and seconded by Kidwai. The latter has always made a great point of the alleged Hindu-Mussulman entente, and this fits in with a report that it was owing to the direct instigation of the Committee of Union and Progress that Indian Mahommedans have taken part in the Nationalist movement in recent years.
(3) An Indian from South Africa named A. A. Mirza spoke at an overflow meeting at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Eoad, on 18.1.19. He spoke strongly in favour of Bolshevism and said that English capitalists were responsible for all the oppression in the world.(4) At a meeting of the &quot; London Indian Association &quot; on 1.3.19, the same man urged the Indian workers to co-operate with English Labour against the governing classes, and declared that the Bolshevism of Russia should be encouraged to spread over India, so that the workers might be liberated from the oppression of their tyrants.(5) In the course of a lecture before the &quot; Britain and India Society &quot; on 29.11.17, J. M. Parikh held out vague threats of the results that would follow if the present system of government in India were not quickly remedied.(6) This man&apos;s speech at the Essex Hall meeting on 12.5.19 was notable. He characterised the Rowlatt Act as &quot;diabolical &quot; and &quot; atrocious &quot; and &quot; a crime against the unanimous voice of India.&quot;(7) On 24.1.18 Marmaduke Pickthall delivered a lecture before the &quot; Cercle d&apos;Etudes Ethno-graphiques&quot; entitled &quot; A Plea for Asia.&quot; He condemned the &quot; Gladstonian Boctrine &quot; of turning the Turk out of Europe, repudiated the Arab Movement, applauded the Turks Pan-Turanian policy, ascribed the Armenian massacres to European intrigue, pleaded for the application of the self-determination principle to Turkey, and advocated a union between the democracies of Britain and Turkey. This speech is characteristic of the speeches and writings of this man. He has a correspondent in Switzerland named Felix Valyi, who edited during the war the Revue Politique Internationale (suspected German propaganda) and may form a link with the Com-mittee of Union and Progress.(8) At a meeting at the Chandos Hall on 13.1.17, S. Saklatwala pointed out to a working class audience that it was to their own interests to support the &quot; people &quot; in their aspirations because at present India serves as a training ground for tyrants of the Master class.(9) In the course of a debate with Arnold Lupton on 15.12.17, Saklatwala contended that the Indians were ground down and oppressed by alien rulers and that all chance of economic progress was impossible until they had acquired freedom politically.(10) At a farewell party to Litvinoff this same man held up the Indian Reforms Scheme to ridicule and said that the war was only supported in India by a few Maharajahs and capitalists, who were bent on the continuance of the present regime in India for their own ends.(11) At the Essex Hall meeting on 12.5.19, Saklatwala argued that the only hope for Indians was to bring about a Bolshevik revolution in England. This man is an extremely active propagandist of the &quot; People&apos;s Russian Information Bureau &quot; and is working indefatig-ably to bring about a sympathetic revolution of the British and Indian proletariats.(12) In the course of his sermon at the Id-ul-Fitr celebration at the Woking Mosque in July, 1917, Kamal-ud-din accused &quot;Christianity of being responsible for the war. As a &quot; Moslem Missionary &quot; it is perhaps natural that he should attack Christianity, and the Islamic Revieiv, published at Woking by him and Kidwai, is full of controversial matter throwing contempt on Christianity. It should, however, be noted that the Woking Mosque, which was intended by its founders to provide merely a place of worship for Mohammedans in England, has been turned into a weapon of militant Islamism as propounded by the Ahmadi sect, and thus indirectly into an organ of Pan-Islamism and anti-Christian propaganda.(13) At the Annual Conference of the &quot; Societe Internationale de Philologie &quot; in June, 1916, Arthur Field made some objectionable remarks about India and contended that immorality in the East is a product of European rule.(14) This man also made a violently pro-Turkish and anti-British speech on the subject of Armenia and the revolt of the Sherif of Mecca at a meeting of the &quot;Cercle d&apos;Etudes Ethno-graphiques &quot; on 21.9.16. This was typical of the propaganda Field is continually carrying on. He seeks notoriety by defying Government on all occasions and is anxious that the authorities should take some action against him. He is constantly starting new organisations for work among the Oriental community, which he is trying to imbue with extreme socialistic ideas.(15) At a debate in the Oxford &quot; Majlis &quot; (Debating Society) on 11.2.17, a student, K. C. Makherjee, said that the English had come to India by treachery and ignoble means and that no Indian wanted English domination. Nor did they want any concessions. How could they forget their friends and relatives who had been hanged on the gallows, or those imprisoned ? It was proposed now that Turkey should be turned out of Europe because her rule was not in accordance with European ideas. Well, English rule was not in accordance with Indian ideas and the Indians wanted the English to go. They did not wish to help to govern the country as it was governed now, they wanted an acknowledgement that the presence of Great Britain in India was wrong. This speech gained for him great popularity among the other students, and indeed both at Oxford and Cambridge the most violent extremists are those who are most influential.
(16) At the Scarsdale Studies on 15.1.1.18, Mukandi Lai addressed a meeting of &quot; Western and Eastern,&quot; in the course of which he compared English officials in India with so many &quot; Kaisers let loose on the poeple.&quot; He foretold that since the advent of Bolshevism the day of reckoning was not far off. He denied that the English occupation had brought peace and prosperity to India. This man was in India a disciple of Lajpat Rai, who will probably come to England from America after peace is signed. He (Mukandi Lai) is believed to have handed on to Tilak a copy of the Bolshevik &quot; blue book &quot; on India.(17) At a meeting of &quot; Britain and India &quot; on 24.10.18, Chaman Lai made sinister refer-ences to daggers and pistols. This young man is another Bolshevik enthusiast and is known to have visited Litvinoff.(.18) At a meeting of the &quot; National Committee of Egypt &quot; in February, 1917, Amin Mohamed el Mishad expressed approval of the German submarine campaign and moved a resolution for the assassination of the Commander of the British forces in Egypt.(19) After the elevation of Lord Sinha to Cabinet rank and to the Peerage, a meeting of Indians was convened to express gratitude and appreciation of Governments action. The extremists like Saklatwala and Mukandi Lai deliberately set out to wreck the meeting, and it is significant that they had no difficulty in accomplishing this end with the almost unanimous support of the student community at Oxford and Cambridge as well as in London.EGYPT.THE BEGINNING.24. The old Nationalist Movement in Egypt, which reached its climax in the time of Sir Eldon Gorst, synchronised with the rise of the Revolutionary movement in India, and was supported and encouraged by the Turkish &quot; Committee of Union and Progress.&quot; Under the administration of Lord Kitchener it ceased to be a living force, and though at the outbreak of the war the Germans sought to revive it with the aid of the banished leaders, no success in this direc-tion was achieved at the time, and the movement became merged in the general anti-British propaganda on the subject of Ireland, India, Egypt, which was a feature of the German &quot; Peace Offensive &quot; in the latter stages of the war. The leaders were also identified with the Pan-Islamic propaganda of the Committee of Union and Progress, which was backed by the Germans and has more recently allied itself with the Bolshevik menace. The recent disturbances were but a violent ebullition of the forces that had been seething since 1906.25. Meantime a fresh political agitation had been started in Egypt itself, but to what extent this was purely indigenous or inspired from enemy agencies is at present impossible to determine. The disturbances which broke out in Egypt in the middle of March, 1919, were the result of long preparation on the part of the Hizb el Umma (Party of the People) under the leadership of Saad Pasha Zagltjl. This man was the Vice-President (elected) of the Legislative Assembly, and has long been known for his anti-British and Nationalist opinions. Though he does not favour anarchist means for gaining his ends, his views are extreme, and he succeeded in winning nearly all the Party over to support Nationalism. He is a very ambitious man, and having succeeded through constitutional means, hoped to win power as the leader of the Rebellion. Until the signing of the Armistice he very wisely made no open move towards this, probably in the hope of victory for the Central Powers, or of the war coming to an end through exhaustion on the part of all the Powers. In either case, he thought, the way would have been easy for Egyptian Nationalists. He now makes a great point of &quot; having waited till the Allies had won the war and signed the Armistice &quot; before beginning to agitate. Without open incitements to revolt, however, he succeeded, during the four years of war, in making very thorough prepara-tions for a rising, and as soon as the Armistice was signed he demanded the right to go to Paris with a mandate from the people, to claim complete independence for Egypt. The Hizb el Umma boasted of having secured 2,000,000 signatures from Egyptians of all classes and creeds to a petition for independence, without regard to the fact that only ninety per cent, of the people could read or write.26. In view of his reputation as a notorious agitator, the application of Saad Zaglul was refused, but at the same time Rushdi Pasha, the Prime Minister, was given facilities for going to London with a colleague to discuss the future of Egypt with our Government. Saad&apos;s party at once brought pressure to bear on him, and made his continuance in office conditional upon permission to sail being given to both Parties. His resignation a few months later was taken to indicate a final refusal to Saad Zaglul, who thereupon became more and more truculent in his demands and language, and began to organize a widespread rebellion. He had succeeded in persuading the Copts to make common cause with the Moslems, a political combination unheard of up to that time.27.  After a final warning, Zaglul and his three principal followers: Mohamed Mahmud Pasha (who was educated at Balliol),Ismail Sidki Pasha (an ex-Minister of the Legislative Assembly), andHamad el Basil ( a Chief of the Eaymn Bedouin),
were arrested and deported on March 8th. Meanwhile the removal of some of the garrisons from Upper Egypt convinced the natives that the stories of the imminent withdrawal of the British from Egypt were true, and as nothing was done to put down the incipient disorders with a strong hand the Rebellion spread. There had been no public rejoicing in Cairo at the time of the Armistice, and it is doubtful whether the Fellahin realised that the Allies had won the war.The details of the rising are too well known to need repetition. It bears many points of resemblance to the beginning of the Indian Mutiny. Order had been practically restored, however, when on April 7th, the order of banishment against the four deportees was withdrawn. This was interpreted as a sign of weakening on the part of the Authorities, and there was an ini-mediate recrudescence of the trouble. Saad Zaglul at once resumed his agitation, and though some of the old Nationalist party were aghast at the storm they had helped to set loose, they had gone too far to draw back. A Delegation started for Paris under Saad Zagluhs leadership, arriving there in the middle of April.THE EGYPTIAN DELEGATION TO FRANCE.28. All these events were eagerly followed by Egyptian Nationalists in England, Prance and Switzerland, and telegrams of encouragement and congratulation were intercepted betAveen various organisations in these countries and members of the Delegation. Pamphlets and eircu-lars were issued to prepare their way, and as soon as the members of the Delegation arrived in Paris they began their work of propaganda.29.  The principal members of the Delegation besides the deportees are : Ali Chaaraw Pasha, Abdel Aziz Eahmi Bey, Abdel Latif el Mehabatty Bey.Two members, Georges Khayat Bey and Sinnot Hanna Bey, had not before taken a prominent part in politics, but are worthy of. note as being Copts. They were probably included to give the Delegation a &quot; National &quot; character.30. Besides issuing printed propaganda, the Delegation made a great bid for official recognition and for publicity. They called on all the Delegations the Italian Delegation alone &quot;returned cards&quot;  and began entertaining lavishly, principally the/Press. The French Socialist organs were friendly, and they succeeded in &quot; buying &quot; one or two of the more extreme ones. They also &quot; acquired &quot; two French Deputies in the same way, and were heard to express surprise at their cheapness as compared with other things one buys in Paris. They lost no opportunity of pressing for interviews with the French and American Plenipotentiaries, in order to &quot; lay the case of Egypt for independence, on the principle of self-determination, before the Peace Congress.&quot;31. They have, however, been disappointed with the results of their intrigues. A luncheon to the Press fell very flat; less than half the invited guests responded neither the English Press nor the better class of French paper were represented and no publicity was given to their speeches. President Wilson withdrew his consent to receive them. The French Government on the ground of their unofficial character, refused to have anything to do with them, and in an official interdepartmental report denounced their leanings towa,rds the Internationale, ending:&quot; (ils) profit(ent) de notre hospitalite pour entreprendre une campagne de presse dans les feuilles socialistes, au grand deplaisir de 1&apos;Angleterre.&quot;The French Press in Egypt, at first rather troublesome, has been forbidden by its Government to print anything &quot; au deplaisir de nos Allies.&quot;32. The Delegation is financed through the Bank of Egypt, Lloyd&apos;s Bank. (France), and the Banca di Roma, and though remittances are sometimes delayed, they have plenty of funds, which are not always disbursed on official expenses. Their correspondence is sent to them through Thomas Cook &amp; Sons.33. The greatest blow to Egyptian Nationalist aspirations has been President Wilson&apos;s recognition of our Protectorate. The leaders had constantly reiterated that it was looked upon by the Egyptians (and proposed by us in the first place) as a purely temporary measure for the duration of the war, to safeguard our Base there. The Khedive, having joined the Turks in 1914, was replaced by Sultan Hussein, with the support of our Protectorate. This they affirm should have lapsed on the signing of the Armistice, and they hoped, with the help of American and French opinion to force us to relinquish it. France&apos;s refusal to have anything to do with the Egyptian Delegation, followed by the withdrawal of President Wilson&apos;s consent to receive them, damped their spirits very considerably.34. Baulked of their ambition to receive official recognition, the Delegates are not unlikely to have recourse to measures of despair, and, remaining away from Egypt, endeavour to obtain by indirect methods what they must fail to achieve by open persuasion.
35. Sympathetic movements with the agitation, both immediately preceding and following the recent outbreaks in Egypt, have been carried on by Egyptians in England, France, and Swit-switzerland, who have been in constant communication with the Delegates in Paris and have assisted them to the best of their ability. The connection of those in Switzerland with German and Turkish intrigue has affected the value of their open propaganda, but they may have heen useful in providing funds derived from hostile sources. We are principally concerned, however, with the activities of those in England.EGYPTIAN SOCIETIES IN ENGLAND.36. The Societies with which Egyptians are connected will now be described in more detail. In the &quot; India House &quot; days there was a certain fraternisation between Indian and Egyptian Nationalists: one Society was called the &quot; Indo-Egyptian Nationalist Association.&quot; Besides this, Egyptians have taken a share in the Associations which are based on the religious idea, and which probably owe their origin to the Pan-Islamic propaganda started hy Abdul Hamid and continued in an intensified form by the Committee of Union and Progress.  These are: (1.) The Islamic Society, originally called &quot; Pan-Islamic Society,&quot; founded in 1886 by a fanatical Indian Moslem for the ostensible purpose of promoting Mohammedan interests in England. This Society began to lay stress on the allegiance owed to the Sultan of Turkey as Caliph of Islam, and in 1915 it issued a strongly worded declaration, expressing resentment at any interference with the Caliphate by non-Moslems. Shortly after this the Society split into two, and one Branch, under the Indian Barrister, Dr. Abdul Majid, lay low until the latter part of last year, when meetings were resumed in the Talbot Boad, Bayswater, and pro-Turkish pan-Islamic views disseminated.   The other Branch assumed the title of : (2.) The Central Islamic Society. This Branch retained the original office of the Society,, at 158, Eleet Street, which is rented by the Sudanese-Egyptian, Duse Mahomed. The moving-spirit is the Indian, Mushir ITusam Eidwai, who has twice visited Constantinople, and who is in close touch with the &quot; Young Mohammedans &quot;in India. They practically control the Woking Mosque, which is conducted by members of what is, from the Mohammedan point of view, an heretical sect called Ahmadis. This sect is again divided into two factions, one of which is, loyal and unobjectionable, while the other is akin to the Wahabis, and is associated with fanatic pan-Islamic and anti-British movements in India. It is the latter faction which rules the conduct of the services at the Mosque and at the Moslem Prayer House at 111, Campden Hill Boad.. This Society has been very active in keeping to the forefront the pan-Islamic idea, and during-the past two years Kidwai has published in its name two pamphlets which advocate in strong-terms the maintenance of the territorial integrity or even the extension of the Ottoman Empire. Kidwai never tires of talking about the &quot; Islamic Nation,&quot; the implication being that every Mohammedan, whether Ottoman, Persian, Tartar, Turkoman, Chinese, Indian, Syrian, Egyptian, etc., owes allegiance to some idealistic Moslem State rather than to the flag under which he happens to be domiciled.Marmaduke Pickthall, an English convert to the Mohammedan faith, and a man of German descent named Charles Schleich, are energetic workers in this connection, and link up the ac-tivities of the Society with the Socialists in this conutry. They have been in communication with Lansbury, Scurr, and Field. Kidwai is constantly at pains to demonstrate that Islam is in complete consonance with Socialistic principles. Eor funds this Society seems to be largely dependent on M. II. Ispahani, a wealthy Indian merchant of Persian descent, who has been turned into an ardent pan-Islamist and who has a business office in London.(3.) The Anglo-Ottoman Society, with its office also at 158, Fleet Street, was founded in 1913-by some more or less sincere well-wishers of Turkey, but control was soon obtained by mischievous persons like Arthur Field, Pickthall, Prelooker, John Arnall, Duse Mahomed, and Kidwai, and some most objectionable pamphlets, vilifying England and Bussia and exculpating Turkey,, have been issued since the war. As, however, it was considered safer to keep the activities of the Society in the background during the war, meetings have been held under the auspices of two new Societies founded for the purpose, viz.: (4.)   The Orient Literary Circle, and (5.)   Cercle cPEtudes Ethnographiques.The main appeal has been for the support of the extreme Socialist or Bolshevik element in the Labour Party.There are two other pseudo-scientific and artistic Societies which serve as a meeting ground for Mohammedans and other Orientals in London.  There are the : (6.) Societe Internationale de Phililogie, Sciences et BeautoArts, run at 8, Taviton Square, by Mustafa Leon, and(7.)   Central School of Chromatics, run at Finsbury Square by the Bev. J. J. Pool.
In all these concerns Egyptians take a share, but beyond. Duse Mahomed the only Egyptian who is at all prominent and who is given to the expression of violent anti-British sentiments is a.young firebrand named Ehsan el Bakry.37. Turning now from religious to purely political Societies run by Egyptian Nationalists, we find that in March, 1914. Earid Bey came to England and founded a branch of the &quot; Sphinx &quot; Society, the headquarters of which were, and stlil are, at Geneva. The open object of this is to expel the British from Egypt. The opening ceremony in London was attended by Indian Pan-Islamists and tho usual English sympathisers like Arthur Field. The Society, however, attracted no further attention and seems to have ceased to exist. Its first President, a medical student went with some companions to Turkey on the outbreak of war with Germany, and subsequently served against us in the Turkish Bed Crescent. Three of them, however, soon tired of this and came to Switzerland, from whence they carried on a voluminous correspondence with their friends in England. They subsequently came to England and were strictly interrogated and cautioned. Having thus learned that their sentiments were well known to the Authorities, they and the other Egyptian Nationalists in England lay very low for a time. An Association called the &quot; NTile Society &quot; was started in 1916 by a student named A. z. Abushady, and a Copt named Mikhail, and later a &quot; National Committee of Egypt &quot; was inaugurated by Abdul Aziz, Abul Khair and Amin Mahomed el Mishad. But both of these were very feeble institutions, and if they worked at all they did so quite secretly.38. There are various other &quot; Literary Associations &quot; and &quot; Social Clubs &quot; which include Egyptians among their membership, but these are of no importance.39.  We now come to the period of renewed Egyptian agitation following the Armistice.The Egyptian Association was founded about February of this year by M. A. Omar, an Egyptian, who at present is the Assistant Pathologist of Charing Cross Hospital. The objects of the Society are &quot; Egypt for the Egyptians.&quot; The members include three-fourths of the Egyptian students in the United Kingdom. Branches have been opened in some big towns in the country and there is a kindred association in Paris, of which little is at present known. The headquarters of the Association, the Imperial Hotel, Russell Square, were raided on the .1.9th May, owing to the virulent nature of some pamphlets issued, but the Director of Public Prosecu-tions decided that a prosecution was inexpedient.40. In Paris the &quot; Association Egyptienne de Paris &quot; was established in July, 1901, the object being to develop bonds of friendship between France and Egypt, but in reality to support the Nationalist claims of the Egyptians.THE DOCTRINE OF ASSASSINATION.41. The Moslem movement in England is following exactly the same course as the Indian Seditionist movement, and unless measures are taken to stop the evil before it has gone too far there must be in every Moslem centre throughout the Empire a. dangerous gang of revolutionaries. The leaders of this movement will do what they have always done, namely, to slip quietly out of it and disclaim responsibility, while the younger generation, whose minds they have poisoned, are left to their fate. The new factor is that perhaps for the first time in history Hindus and Moslems have forgetton their old enmities and joined together in a conspiracy against British Authority.42. It is impossible to foretell how soon this agitation will culminate in a series of attempted assassinations ol prominent Englishmen, both in England and Egypt and in India. At this moment the Terms of Peace to be imposed on Turkey are being watched with the greatest anxiety by all classes of Moslems. One of the practices of the Committee of Union and Progress has always been to despatch Fedms (fanatical assassins) to commit outrages in the name of religion, and it is quite certain that this Committee will not be appeased by the kind of Peace that Turkey will be required to sign. It will, on the contrary, have a fresh excuse and incentive for desperate measures, and as the control which has been maintained at the ports during the war is relaxed, we shall no doubt find their agents coming to England on the excuse of education, where they will find the soil well prepared for a harvest of terrorism.43. It is clear from private letters which have occasionally been intercepted that many of the writers are possessed by deep passion. For example, Dr. K. S. what, who is conductiong post-graduate studies at St. Bartholomew^ Hospital, and is regarded there as a quiet, inoffensive little man, in a letter to his brother in India gives expression to a violent hatred of and a desire to assault all Englishmen except those of the poorest classes. This man has been subjected to the teachings of Saklatwala, Arthur Field and such like. Again in a letter to a brother in Switzer-land, an Egyptian student at Edinburgh Avrites that there is no hope of the liberation of Egypt oxcept through bloodshed.THE REMEDY.44. It may be said that the Law provides a remedy for sedition and assassination, but prevention is better than cure.  That the Law is a. very ineffective shield against sedition is
shown by experience both before and since the beginning of the war. Evidence of seditious speeches is generally obtained from persons whose identity cannot be revealed, either because they are valuable informants or because their lives would be in danger. The Rowlatt Acts in India give power to the Government to take the necessary action if inflammatory propaganda is followed by criminal conspiracy. Presumably also the Egyptian Government will be armed * with the weapon of Martial Law for some time to come, but in England, the centre of the Empire and the place from which these conspiracies draw their inspiration and their personnel, the exis-ting Law leaves us practically powerless.45. The remedy proposed is to take power for sending persons born in one of the British Dominions back to the Dominion from whence he came. There is probably now a legal power to deport Egyptians of this character since they are British protected persons and a Deportation Order could be made against them under the Aliens Act, but this does not apply to the British Indian, who is a British sabject, nor does it apply to the West Indian negro nor the Chinaman born in Hong Kong. The last named is not at present a danger, but the negro has lately been concerned in riotous outbreaks in Liverpool and Cardiff. There is no doubt the legal difficulty that if the Executive Power is vested with authority to deport a British subject, what becomes of the rights of British subjects under the Habeus Corpus Act ? It is suggested that these might be safe-guarded by giving the person on whom an Order had been made, a right of Appeal to a special Tribunal, when the Crown could put before such a Tribunal statements not necessarily supported by legal evidence, on which the appellant could be examined. The advantage of a power of Deportation is that the very fact that the Government has this power has in the past proved sufficient to make its use unnecessary. For example, there were many thousand Russians of Bolshevik tendencies in the East End of London six months ago. It was found enough to send a hundred of them out of the country for the rest to abandon seditious meetings and to keep as quiet as possible. The same factor was noticed in the case of the Egyptian Association, which was raided two months ago. Not knowing what would follow, the members have abstained from active agitation ever since. It is confidently expected that after the first batch of Egyptian and Indian revolutionaries there would be no need for many months to use the power again. But unless some such measure is adopted it is safe to predict that some outrage, such as the assassination of a Minister, will be committed, and then an explosion of public opinion will compel the Government of the day to take action when it is too late.46. Appended to this report is a list of the most active of the Indian and Egyptian revolutionaries in this country, and of some Europeans associated with them in England.B. H. T.
