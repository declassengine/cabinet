Memorandum by the President of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries.I wish to urge upon the War Cabinet as strongly as possible the immediate adoption of the proposal in paragraph 4 (f) I of Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s Memorandum of the 1st July, G.T.7S98 to i transfer Armament Buildings to the Board of Agriculture,I associate myself with Sir Alfred Mond*e recommendation 7 (3) and trust that the War Cabinet will accept this recommendation and allocate Armament Buildings to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as soon as it can be vacated,    7!h&amp; work of the Board is increasing every day.    It is impossible to realise either economies or efficiency from the reorganisation scheme which has been adopted as long as the staff of the Board remains scattered in 19 different buildings.ERNL2.ily Uth 1919.
