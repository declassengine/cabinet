pis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Govermment). I WAR CABINET.G.T.7676.    1 ^&quot;The Government War Obligations Bill, and the guarantee ofof Cereal Pricas.&quot;Memorandum by tho President of tho Board of Agriculturo and I Fisheries.During the War, Government War Obligations Bills have been at intervals presented to Parliament, in order to charge on the Consolidated Puhd tho payments required for tho discharge if obligations incurred by or on behalf  f the Government before prescribed dates.    The last Bill was passed on 8th August, 1918, and applies to obligations incurred before that date.A Bill extending those provisions to the discharge of Government obligations incurred before the Bill receives the Royal Assent, waB presented to Parliament and read a second time on 2nd June, 1919.The War Obligations referred to are specified in the Schedule to the Government War Obligations Act, 1914 (5 Geo.V. dull). Paragraph 5 of the Schedule includes &quot;obligations incurred in connection with the present War in respect of the maintenance or assistance in connection with the present war of food supply trade industry business or communications in the United Kingdom or in any other country or for the relief af distress in the United Kingdom or in any other country.&quot;Immediately after the      Armistice was signed, the Government decided to give a guarantee of minimum prices for the      cereals harvested in 1919, in order to maintain and assist food supplies during the anticipated shortage arising out of the War.    The guarantee was announced on 19th November, 1918, and farmers havo persistently pressed for legislative sanction being obtained to the guarantee.I am advised that this guarantee is an obligation within paragraph 5 quoted above, and is therefore covered, even without an amendment, by the Government War Obligations Bill, 1919.In asking the House of Commons to read for a second time the Government War Obligations Bill, 1919, the financial Secretary to the Treasury did not mention the      eeroal guarantee among the financial obligations then existing.    He therefore feels that the subsequent inclusion of the guarantee in the Bill would be regarded by some members of the House as a breach of faith.I think that members could not press this contention with any force, if, as I suggest, the inclusion of thi3 obligation is specifically raised in Committee by an appropriate amendment.They could only urge that the House had been deprived of the opportunity of rejecting the Bill on the Second Reading, but I think it is clear that the inclusion of the obligation among those for which provision is to be made by the Bill is a matter to be dealt with in Committee, and not a matter affecting the principle of the proposed legislation.     I suggest, therefore, that section 1 (3) should be amended so as to rea4,&quot;Any obligation incurred in respect of the maintenance or assistance of flax production or the production
r]!  cerea^s^or in raepect of ^ny-guarantee given in connection herewith, la Jbarssby declared&apos; to be an obligation undertaken in onnection with the present war.&quot;If this course is not adopted, two courses are open -(l)   to leave the provision of the neoessary funds for the fulfilment of the obligation to be dealt with in the 1919 Session, which would be entirely unsatisfactory to the  farriers;   or %(2)   to introduce a separate Bill this Session dealing with the matter.If such a Bill were introduced, it would be difficult to sivoid a considerable discussion, not only from the point of view )f those who are opposed to the guarantee, but also from the   point )f view of those who are proaaing for a definition of the GovcrnBienV-B attitude towards Agriculture in the future.   &apos; there would also be an attempt to connect the guarantee of prices/with a guarantee of wages.The disadvantagee of such legislation are such that I Btrongly urge the adoption of &quot;the ajociidjae-nt of the Government War Jbllgatlcrns Bill.ERULE-.12th July, 1919.f
