(deceived 7th, 10.30 a.m.)Clear the line.991 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Following from Roos-Keppel, dated 5th July:  &quot; Individuals and deputations of all tribes are visiting Dost Muhammad in Jalalabad and Nadir Khan in (?Moradabad) to get definite confirmation of promises that Amir will obtain from Government of India amnesty for all deserters, mutineers and revolted tribesmen. Upper Mohniands are collecting above Hazarnao, but not as yet in very large numbers. Akbar Khan of the Lalpiira family is in charge of Lashkar and is issuing rations to them under orders from Jalalabad. Confirmation received of presence of Afghan officers in Tirah recruiting Afridis. They have not had much success hitherto, but are urging Afridis to hold a jirga to discuss the question. Afridis are quite willing that Amir should include amnesty for deserters in his peace terms, but show no enthusiasm regarding suggestion made by Afghan agents that Tirah should become integral part of Afghanistan. Yur Muhammad Khan, whose fort at Chnra is garrisoned by Afghan Shinwari tribesmen, is appre-hensive of attack by us and pickets the approach to Chura Kando every night. Otherwise all districts and agencies quiet.&quot;Following from Waziristan, dated 5th July : &quot;Tone of Northern Waziristan Militia has improved greatly, and most of the Afridis who went on furlough sick on war are returning. Trend of Nadir Khan&apos;s recent diplomacy appears to he to keep Wazirs and Mahsuds definitely committed to (? support of Afghans) in the event of a failure of peace negotiations, while avoiding any flagrant breach of armistice terms.&quot;
