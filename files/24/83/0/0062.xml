:   r* k (SiSot.ffttiQ If &apos; &apos;4,8)    -   234^^-rht^ML CONTROL Off GOVSRmaJOHT ROAD gRANSPOBIP.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LILiJ.TJ.riO?JR.With reference to Mr.-Long!s memorandum of the 27th ;,. ,May (G.T.. 7359) on the officialese of Government Cars, I feel .,.. convinced that a considerable waste of public money is incurred through overlapping on the part of the Various Government De-pa rt me nts , in connection with the provision of mechanical Road : Transport both in the shape of cars and of lorries.   This arises through the duplication of journeys, and also through the dupli-cation of garages and establishments in close proximity to one another.   There are also occasions when a particular Department has an exceptional pressure of work and has to resort to hiring, , whilst another Department may have vehicles standing idle. A^ain, in the case of hiring, increased expenditure is incurred owing to the fact that individual requirements ( being for short periods ) involve higher rates than if a contract were made for an extended period, a course which would be possible if all requirements were pooled.So far as the Ministry of Munitions is concerned I have appointed a Committee to go into the whole question of the use of oars with the view, to securing the greatest possible economy.   In the mean time I have taken steps to reduce considerably the number of cars maintained for use both at-:Headquarters and ih the country and to pool the remainder.   I have, also given instructions for.  /expensive types, such as the Rolls Royce, to be sold immediately whilst the present high prices prevail. : The older and less efficient cars will also be; disposed of under the present favour-ab/le conditions and will be replaced by cars as far as possible of a uniform type.   This should ensure economy both in repairs andi. in the provision of scares.
I -am firmly of opinion that similar action should &quot;be taken in regard to Government cars generally, and that immediate steps should &quot;be taken to co-ordinate all Government Road Trans-port under one Department.   Thistof course, would not apply in  he ease, of the fighting and postal services, as presumably the Admiralty, Vlar1 Office, Air Ministry and Post Office, must each retain transport services uhdor its own control. . But the temporary requirements of these Departments&apos; of a civil or quasi-oivil -character, and all other requirements of Government Departments for transport vehicles, could be controlled, more economically and efficiently by one organisation.   Further, in such a system of centralised control uniform regulations could more easily be enforced.   I attach great importance to this latter point in view of the strong feeling against the improper use of Government transport which exists at the present time.10th July, 1919, I.,
