No.506/281, from Vice Admiral Sir Sydney R. Premantle, K.O.B. , M.V.O. , Senior Naval Officer Afloat at scapa, and of that dated 23rd idem, Non 050/91 of Rear Admiral Robert Jo Prcndergast, 0*B. , commanding&quot; the Orkneys and Shetlands, on the circumstances attending the occurrence.   It is submitted that the trans-lations^of the German documents forwarded with the Vice Admiral\s letter may be checked on receipt at the Admiralty.2.-  It is probable that the plans to sink the interned ships were prepared in Germany and that Roar Admiral Von Router, by his act, executed the order of his Government or probably of the German Military Party. This opinion is based on Rear Admiral Von Router1s orders dated 17th June,&apos; 1919, B. No. P*39 (Enclosure F.. in the report of the Senior Naval Officer Afloat, scapa).   The first two clauses of -those orders should apparently read as follows     ,:(1) On reoeipt of this order, Captains will prepare the ships for sinking, so that they may sink as quickly as possible when the order is issued. ,(2) After disembarkation of the crews (i.e. the 2,200 men sent back to Germany on Tuesday, 17th June, 1919) preparations as extensive as possible are to be completed, etc.3.-  Further confirmation of the view that the instructions for sinking the ships emanated from Germany is furnished by the fact that Lieutenant Stoiner, in command of the division of Gorman Destroyers, informed Rear AdmiralProndsrgast, as reported in Clause 8 of the lattorb submission of 23rd Juno, 1919, No. -050/91 &quot;that they had been ready for tho last month 11 to sink their vessels; and that only 5 minutes warning had u elapsed&quot; between the order to scuttle and its execution (showing careful preparation).4*-   In Clause 6 of Rear Admiral von Router1 s orders, quoted above, the Captains of German Ships are directed to aink their vessels if an attempt is made by the British to seize them.   Rear Admiral von Reuter states in these instructions that he intended to sink the ships only &quot;if the enemy   -wishes to take possession of them without the approval of tho Government^   This is not, however, in accordance with the statement made when onboard H.M.S. ^Revenge&quot; (see paragraph 10, Section 711; p 13 of the report of the Senior Naval Officer Afloat, Scapa, quoted above), thst he would have sunk the ships whether the British Admiral had been in harbour or not.
5.-    My oonoulsion is that orders were sent from Germany that the interned ships were to be sunk and in no circumstances to be surrendered, and that the arrangements -for doing so were ($$perfected on or after Wednesday, the 18th June, when the surplus crews, embarked at Scapa on the previous day, were safe in Germany.   The plans for sinking and damaging tho th ips appear to have been confined to the officers alone, but, had they been more widely known, there would.have been little chance of their coming to the knowledge of any Officers and men of the British fleet] on account of the limited intercourse permitted between them and the Germans.   The ease with which the preparations for the sinking of the ships were carried out is shown by the report of the Commanding Officer of Drifter C*D. No.2. which was lying alongside the &quot;Emden6 at Noon on the 21st, that the Officers were at lunch while the ship was actually sinking (paragraph 23, Section 11 of report of Senior Naval Officer Afloat, Scapa) and that, until the crew of the &quot;Emden11 ran aft, the ratings manning tho Drifter were not aware that anything unusual was taking place.In Clause 27, Section 11 of the same report it is stated that Puffer &quot;Nellie Laud&quot; was alongside the &quot;Bayern&quot; eubarking stores when that ship commenced to sink-6.-  The First Battle Squadron was at sea on Saturday 21st June, 1919, with my approval, to complete a Gunnery and Torpedo Exercise Programme, which had been delayed owing to bad weather, and I had ordered that the programme was to be completed by the end of the week.The absence of the Battleships probably determined the time when the German Admiral decided to act, but it had not any influence, in my opinion, on whether he ordered the sinking or not*Had the Battleships been in harbour it is probable that Rear Admiral von Reuter would have ordered the ships to be sunk during the night, as is indicated by the two examples given in his orders, since the sinking of the ships would have oeen less readily detected and the armed parties would have taken longer to arrive.The presence of the Battleships in the Anchorage would not have exercised any deterrent effect on the German Officers, if they had made up their minds to open the seacocks, and there is evidence that this work was performed by the Officers and not by the men.It is doubtful also whether the presence of our ships would have resulted in a smaller loss of the Gorman Ships.   The guard Destroyer &quot;V/estcott11 was, in fact, unable to save the &quot;Hinden-burg&quot;, on account of the short time necessary to sink a ship, the parties sent from our Battleships to seize them, would probably have arrived too late to keep them afloat&apos;, it is estimated that a ship of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth8 class for example,, can be sunk in from 25 minutes to one hour&apos; from the time of the orders being received, and the &quot;Kaiser Priedrich der I Grosse&quot; sunk within 50 minutes of Rear Admiral von Renter&apos;s j orders (1120 to 1210).   A ship could be too far gone to admit I of her being saved when half the periods of time mentioned above had elapsed.I 7-- Kcthing unusual was observed from the &quot;Victorious11 ,llfhich is anchored in the middle of the German Destroyers&apos; I anchorage in Gutter Sound, until Just after noon; which was 1 three quarters of an hour after the signal to sink the ships 1 had been made by &quot;Emden&quot; I8.- In my telegrams 1509 and 1615 of the 18th June, 1919, j addressed to Senior&quot;Naval Officer Afloat, Scapa, I approved of 1 the First Battle Squadron proceeding to sea for exercises on
21st June, 1919, as I did not consider, and have not con-sidered, that their presence or absenoe froiii scapa would pre-vent the ships being sunk-   The usual guard was left in the anchorage, consisting of 7 Trawlers and Drifters ooMnanded by Officers and manned by active service ratings and under way, and two Destroyers either under way or anchored at five minutes notice-I do not consider that the signal from Admiral von Reuter to the Chief of the Baltio Station (reported in paragraph 5, Section Vll, of the report of Senior Naval&quot;Officer Afloat, &quot; Scapa) need have aroused any suspicion in the mind of the Vice Admiral Conmanding, First Battle Squadron, or necessitated his putting off the exercise.9.-  I concur with the Vios Admiral that there appeared to be no cause for anxiety that a breach of the Aruistice Terms would be permitted by Admiral von Reuter.   All the Senior Officers that have been in charge &amp;  the interned ships at Scapa have reported that he did his best, generally with success, to oarry out instructions given him.10.- The orders dated 21st May, 1919, No. 280/107, issued by Vice Admiral Fremantle as Senior Naval Officer Afloat, scapa, and approved by me, for seizing the German ships should any breach of the Armistice Terms bo committed or suspected, have already been forwarded in Atlantic Fleet letter of 22nd June, 1.819, No.371/A.H.0050, Enclosure No.6. Theso were subsequently superseded by orders dated 19th June, 1919, vide Enclosure BD&quot; to&apos;report from Vioe Admiral Commanding, 1st Battle Squadron, dated&apos;24th June, No- 506/281.   I took the following steps to obtain due warning of any political circumstances likely to cause a breach of the Armistice on the part of Rear Admiral von Reutor :-On 22nd April, 1919, I requested the Admiralty, in telegram No-51. to keep me informed of the political situation, so that I might put orders for seizure into operation if necessary^On Friday 13th June, 1919, when visiting the Admiralty, I requested the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff to forward to me an appreciation of tho political situation daily, commencing on Tuesday, 17th June, so-that I might be prepared to take aotion if necessary; Their Lordships, however&quot;, were not able to give me any useful information during tho week.On 2lst June, 1919, by Atlantic Fleet telegram No.307, I requested to know the ultimate disposal of the German ships and the Board replied, by Admiralty telegram No-639, that ttNo information has been received, and it is understood this question has not yet been dealt with in Paris.   You will be informed immediately anything is known&quot;A further telegram was received from Their Lordships that evening stating that the Naval action already approved (the seizing of the German ships) should take effect immediately on the expiration of the Armistice if the Germans had not intimated their willingness to sign the Treaty of Peace before that moment had arrived.It had been my intention on receipt of these instructions to direct the Senior Naval Officer Afloat at Scapa to send for Rear Admiral von Reuter to acquaint him of the decision reached, and to inform him that he (von Reuter) remained responsible for the interned ships until they had been surrendered to the British^ fl       I regret that Admiralty telegram No.573 of 17th June, 1919, announcing the extension of the period required for signing the Peace Terms from Saturday, 21st to Monday, 23rd June ,1919, was not repeated by me to the Senior Naval Officer Afloat, Scapa. &apos; None of these communications, which usually reached me through
(Sd.)   O.E. MADDENADMIRAL-&apos; the Press, were comiiunicatod to Rear Admiral von Reuter, however. I considered it would be&apos;sufficient tc inform.him when the ships would be tal-:en over*Furthermore, it is clear from the orders whioh he issued that the ships would have been sunk on the first signs of an. attempt to seize them.Hp- My view of the situation during this weefc was, that, the ships being interned, there was no authority to place armed guards on board or to seize them, unless there was reason to doubt the honour of Rear Admiral von Reuter or to believe that he had lost control of his ships5 companies^   Events proved that he had full control of his men and I had no reason to doubt his good faitho12c. -  Rear AdmiralP?en :.crgast 3 as Senior Naval Officer at noon     21st June, when the German vessels were scuttled, acted with promptitude and energy, and the beaching of the Destroyers and light cruisers, and the salving of the &quot;Baden11 are due to his zeal and resource.
Copy. No.506/281,&quot;REVENGE&quot; at SCAPA 24th June, 1919.Sir,I have the honour to report as follows on the sinking of the German Interned Fleet at Scapa.I.    NARRATIVE.At 1230, 21st June, the First Battle Squadron, with &quot;SPENCER&quot;, &quot;SHAKESPEARE&quot; and seven Destroyers of the 2nd Flotilla were at sea for practice of a torpedo attack by destroyers and long range torpedo practice by the battleships.2.   The destroyer attack had taken place and destroyers were picking up their torpedoes.5.   The 1st Division of the First Battle Squadron (&quot;REVENGE&quot; j &quot;RAMILLIES&quot; and. &quot;ROYAL SOVEREIGN&quot;) were in a position 580 33i&apos;N., 20 29&apos;W., 25 miles from the entrance to Scapa Flow, the 2nd Division (&quot;RESOLUTION&quot; and &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot;) 10 miles to the Southward, both divisions engaged in taking up their positions for the next run,4.    Inside the harbour, were three destroyers, two of which, the Guard destroyers (,:WALP0LE&quot; and &quot;WESTCOTT&quot;) had steam ready, and were at their normal positions, viz,, buoys D97 and J04 respectively, in the vicinity of the Gorman destroyers at one end of the lines of the largo ships.5.     Four Guard trawlers were patrolling among the German ships in accordance with my standing orders, viz., &quot;CABALSHI&quot; ,  &quot;CUDWOSIN&quot;,  &quot;RAMA&quot; and &quot;CASRSIN&quot;.       The Communication Drifters &quot;C.D.1&quot;, &quot;CD.2&quot; and &quot;TRUST ON&quot;, and the Flag- Despatch Drifter &quot;RECLUSE&quot; were also in the vicinity of the German ships.6.   At 1220 I received a W/T message from H.M.S. &quot;HSCSTCOTT&quot; &quot;Gorman battleship sinking&quot;, followed shortly afterwards by a message from Rear Admiral Robert J,Pendergast, CBc, commanding Orkneys and Shotlando &quot;German Battleship &quot;KAISER FRLEDRICH&quot; Class sunk.&quot;   All battleships and cruisers &quot;hoisting German ensign.     Crews of destroyers preparing to &quot;abandon ship&quot;.7.    I immediately cancelled the exercise, and proceeded with the 1st Division at full speed for Scapa Flow. &quot;SPENCER&quot; was directed to proceed with eix destroyers at the utmost speed to Gutter Sound, and to deal with the situation as regards the German destroyers.    I directed him that the German destroyers were to be required to surrender; being boarded and fired upon if necessary.    I retained tvso destroyers with me for eventualities.8.- The 2nd..........Secretary of the Admiralty.Commander-in-Chief,Atlantic &amp; Home FleetstH.M.S.  &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;.
7.   The18:.     The 2nd Division of battleships was directed, to return to the anchorage with all despatch.9,     The 1st Division anchored in Scapa Flow at 1430, the 2nd Division at 1600, both divisions being berthed in proximity to the German Fleet.. 10,     While returning to the anchoragep the Rear Admiral Commanding Orkneys and Shetlands was requested to send all available trawlers and drifters to the battleships on their arrival, all Marines were prepared for landing, three large armed guards in each ship were prepared, and all steam and double-banked boats were prepared for service, and orders were given as to the measures to be taken on arrival.II.   PROCEEDINGS IN THE PORT ANTECEDENT TO THE ARRIVAL OfffflRST BATTLEoSgUADRON AND DESTROYERS.,The only seagoing ohijps remaining in the port after the departure of the First Battle Squadron and destroyers were the:-&quot;SANDHURSTa   .....

Guard boat for German destroyers -steam up,IJlC$STC0TTiJ.. *.....Guard boat for German ships -steam up.A number of trawlers and drifters manned from theFirst Battle Squadron.2,     Rear Admiral Prendergast, commanding Orkneys and Shetlands, reports-, that at 1207 the destroyer &quot;WESTCOTT&quot; reported to him that a German battleship w$s sinking, and at&quot; the same time it if as observed from &quot;VICTORIOUS&quot; that the interned ships and destroyers were hoisting the German colours and a red burgee, the red burgee meaning, according to German Officers, ,;Engage the enemy&quot;, &apos; -3.     The Rear Admiral immediately assembled all local small craft off the &quot;VICTORIOUS&quot;.     On their arrival some were despatched to the flow/ (in accordance with a W/l message from me) to await the arrival of the First Battle Squadron, others were despatched to assist in the salvage of the German ships and others to round up Germans who were abandoning their ships.-4,     The Rear Admiral rightly decided that it was useless to waste the services of his small craft on the large german ships, and concentrated his efforts on the Destroyers,,5.     Thy Admiralty Port Officer was directed to slip the cables of the destroyers and to beach them.   Considerable difficulty was experienced in slipping the cables as thoy had been secured with several turns to the bollards and were lashed overall, while the pins of the shackles were hammered so that they could not be freed.6,     The efforts of tho local craft under the control of the Rear Admiral were, nevertheless, most successful, and resulted in the beaching of no less than 13 German destroyers. His tugs also slipped the cable of the &apos;;BRJSMSE&quot; and assisted to take her in tW, assisted with the ;IEMDEN&quot;, and made an unsuccessful attempt to     tow.the &quot;DRESDEN&quot;.
h.mcsc &quot;WALPOLE&quot; slipped from her buoy on observing what was occurring,   After taking effective measures by rifle fire to force the German destroyer crews back to their ships, and having Bent parties on board six German destroyers to force the crews to close valves, etc,, she proceeded to the &quot;IIUMBSRG^ slipped her cable, and allowed her to drift onshore.IS.       H.M.S. ,513STC0TT:J at 1205 on observing the &quot;KAISER FRIEDRICH DI5R GROSSE&quot; heeling over, info mod me by W/T, slipped and proceeded to Gutter Sound to inform the &quot;VICTORIOUS&quot;0On her return to the large ship anchorage parties were put on board two German destroyers which succeeded in beaching them before they sank.14*       Seeing that the &quot;HIMDIRBERG&quot; would apparently remain afloat the longest of the German battle cruisers, the Commanding Officer closed her, and placed on board a party with orders to do everything possible to save her from sinking.15.       This party was able to close a certain number of W.T. openings,   Finding it impossible to slip the cables (both anchors were down), they were parted by two 24-lbs. primers on each cable just above the water line.   The ship was taken in tow, but time did not admit of her boing beached before sinking and she lies on an even keel in 11 fathoms.16,       Although the &quot;wTHSTCOTT5&apos; gave prcmpt information to me and to the Rear Admiral Commanding Orkneys and Shetlands and afterwards did good service with the &quot;HIFD1NJ3ERG&quot;, it is - * to be regretted that, being the ship on whom lay the immediate responsibility for the guard on the large German ships, her Commanding Officer did not take similar action to that taken inGutter........7.      The Commanding Officer of H.M.S. HSANDHURST&quot;, who was after the departure of the First Battle Squadron, and Destroyers, the Senior ^aval Officer Afloat at Scapa, decided, to take action with the force, available in the following order of urgency(a) To get Germans back to their ohips,oj To prevent them landing in large numbers.c) To prevent ships sinking if possible.d) To beach ships which could not be kept afloat.8*      As it was apparent that little could be do$o for the large ships, he concentrated his attention on the destroyers.9.      A party from &quot;SANDHURSTn *as sent to deal with all the destroyers (12) at one trot, with the result that four sank, seven were beached, and one was kept afloat.10.       &quot;SANDHURST&quot; also received all the German prisoners from the destroyers until she was able to turn thorn over to the ;hat tl e ship 3.11.      Available Officers in HtM.S. &quot;SANDHURST&quot; Were sent away in email craft to force Germans in boats to return to their sniper     This measure, enforclsd in some cases by opening fire oh boats which did not obey orders,, was very effective end undoubtedly caused the sinking of several destroyers to be delayed, thus enabling their cables to be cut and the destroyers to be beached.K
FIRST BATT.L&apos;5 SQUADRON LISTER No.506/281 dated 24th June 191^Gutter Sound, drive the Germans back to their ships by small arm fire, and remove or sink boats alongside.   The order that no German ship was on any account to lower a boat without permission was well known and thoroughly enforced.17.     The two drifters &quot;RAMA&quot; and t&quot; TRUST ON&quot; manned from the destroyer flotilla, and commanded respectively by a Sub-Lieutenant and midshipman, rendered valuable service by driving, with rifle fire, Gorman destroyer crews back to their ships, and subsequently by their assistance in cutting the cables of German destroyers.18*     H.MyS. &quot;VEGA&quot; cast off at 1245, ran alongside two German destroyers and placed boarding party on board, and succeeded in beaching another before she sank. Owing to a mistake in the engine-room she was in collision with a German destroyer and sustained serious damage forward.z    19.     Trawler &quot;CtHMOSIN11 (manned from &quot;ra2.1ILLISS&quot;), a Guard trawler, hailed the Captain of the &quot;KONIG ALBiSRT&quot;, from whose ship men were leaving in boats, to get thorn on board again, and threatened to shoot them if hi3 orders were not obeyed.   Unfortunately the Commanding Officer did not execute hi3 threat when the boats, on shoving off, hoisted the whito flag.20.      Trawler &quot;CABALSBP&apos;, (manned from &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot;), a Guard trawler observed, at a time given as 11.30, a boat being lowered from the &quot;FRI2DRICH DER GR0SS3&quot; and despatched a passing picket boat to inform the guard destroyer, she subsequently opened fire on the boats of the &quot;BAYHIRN&quot; and ordered them baok to their ship.   Her Commanding Officer also fired on the &quot;MARKGRAF&quot; which was attempting to hoist out a steamboat, and on the boats of several other ship3.   He reports that, as the ship3 were sinking, his fire produced no effect.21&apos;     Trawler &quot;CLOISIN&quot;,     (manned from &quot;RESOLUTION&quot;), was standing off but rendered valuable assistance to &quot;WALP0L3&quot; in delaying the sinking of &quot;NURNBERG&quot; and slipping her cable.22.     Trawler &quot;CACHOSIN&quot;, (manned by &quot;REVMGE&quot;), had on board Mr. Bernard Gribble, R.A., to whom I had been directed to afford sketching facilities.   At noon 3he was lying off the &quot;BADEN&quot; and until the arrival of the Guard trawler, prevented the &quot;BADEN&apos;S&quot; and &quot;BAYEREMS&quot; boats from leaving their ships.     She then took in tow four boats belonging to the &quot;FRANKFURT&quot;, put the men on board their ship, and cut the boat adrift.   To this smart action wa3 due the delay in   Sinking the &quot;FRANKFURT&quot;, which enabled her to be beached.23.     Drifter &quot;CD.2&quot;, (manned from &quot;RAMILLISS&quot;), was alongside &quot;EMDSN&quot; at noon&apos;, superintending the disembarkation of Officers&apos; stores which were to be sent to &quot;DOLLART11 ,   Tho Commanding Officer states that the majority of officers were at lunch when the men came running aft shouting that the ship wa3 sinking.   The German Rear Admiral and his Flag Captain endeavoured to get into the drifter, but were ordered back.     The Commanding Officer afterwards stood by the ;,EMD i:&quot; until the arrival of the n SHAKE SPEARS&quot;.    It is evident that panic took place in tho &quot;EMDII3N&quot;, that she was hurriedly abandoned, and that the sinking operations were carried out by no means so effective-ly as in the majority of the ships.     This was possibly due to the presence of three British drifters alongside her.
Resolution.........FIRST BATTLE SQUADRON LETTER No.506/281 dated 24th June, 1919,24&apos;     DRIFTER&apos;&quot;RECLUSE&quot; (manned from &quot;RAMILLIES&quot;), was also alongside &quot;the &quot;EMDEN&quot; (as Flag Despatch Drifter) and   , took off her crew.25*     ^DRIFTER &quot;C.D.1&quot; (manned from &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot;), was alongside as Communication Drifter.   The German Rear Admiral with his staff came on board and was taken to Houton Bay, and eventually on board &quot;REVENGE&quot;.26.     Trawler &quot;CAERSIN&quot;, (manned from &quot;ROYAL OAK&quot;), was standing off and collecteTprisoners in boats,27-     PUFFER &quot;NELLIE LAUD&quot;,had on board a search party of three men from &quot;ROYAL 0AKT, under an Acting Gunner, and was engaged in embarking stores from &quot;BAYSR1T&quot; for conveyance to the German storeship.   The Acting Gunner, with well-judged initiative, took charge of the Puffer, proceeded on board the &quot;KRONPRINZ WILHELM&quot; and informed the Commanding Officer that he would be fired on if he attempted to leave his ship, and then took up a position between &quot;KRONPRINZ WILHELM&quot; and &quot;MARKGRAF&quot; and opened fire on all Germans who attempted to get into boats.   He then took prisoners over 100 Germans and held them in the hold of the Puffer until he was able to transfer them to a battleship.28.     Trawler &quot;CLASSIN&quot;,(manned from &quot;REVENGE&quot;), which was standing off, after slipping the oables of the &apos;t/.&apos;-    -&quot;DRESDEN&quot;, preparatory to taking her in tow, which she was unable to do before &quot;DRESDEN&quot; sank, assisted most ably in the beaching of &quot;BREMSE&quot; and &quot;FRANKFURT&quot;.29 *     Trawler &quot;COALSIN&quot;, (manned from &quot;ROYAL SOVEREIGN&quot;), was coaling in Gutter Sound and assisted in unshaci&amp;ling oables and beaching destroyers.30.     With regard to the action taken by the three destroyers and the several trawlers and drifters manned from the Squadron which were in harbour, while &apos;all performed useful service, it is to the officers who grasped the situation promptly, and whose initiative and determination led them to fire on the German baats which were acting in direct violation of orders that the saving of the &quot;BADEN&quot;, &quot;FRANKFURT&quot; and &quot;NURHBERG&quot; is due.     The majority of those who found themselves in responsible positions as Guardships took this action, while in the case of some of the remainder, which were a considerable distance from the ships when the critical moment occurred, the boats (all of which flew white flags) had drifter too far to be driven back to their own particular vessel.   All these craft, however, rendered effective service in rounding up German boata, some of which were making for Kfcpkwall, and preventing landings.III.   PROCEEDINGS OF BATTLE SQUADRON ON ARRIVAL.1. The measures taken on arrival were as follows :-(l) Three latfge armed guards were sent from each ship of the 1st Division in separate trawlers. &quot;Revenges&quot; parties were ordered to take the S.W. portion of the lines of German Ships, &quot;RAMILLISS&quot; tine centre, the &quot;ROYAL SOVEREIGN&quot; the N.E. end. ihe orders for the armed guards were to board any ship which there appeared to be any possibility of saving, and to use all possible means to prevent her sinking.
FIRST BATTLE SQUADRON LETTER NO.506/281 dated 24th June 1919.

"Resolution" and "Royal Oak" were directed on their arrival to send salvage parties to "Baden" and "Emden&apos;, which there appeared to be a possibility of saving.

(2) All Marine Detachments were landed, different portions of the ?cast line in the vicinity of the German ships and destroyers being allotted to them. They were directed to patrol the coast line, secure any Germans who might have landed and re-assure the local population.

(3) All steam and double banked beats not required for landing Marines were sent away to secure German beats and make their occupants prisoners.

(4) A destroyer was sent to the Hexa entrance to ensure no German beat leaving the harbour.

(5) Aeroplanes were despatched to patrol the coast lines and report any German beats landing unobserved by British small craft.

2.- On my arrival at 1430 the "Raden",  "Markgraf", "Hindenberg", "Derfflinger", "Emden", "Nurnberg" "Brummer" and "Frankfurt" were still afloat but obviously sinking. No German colours were flying. A large number of German boats, filled with Officers and men, and with white flags flying, were apparently awaiting our arrival. Destroyers, tugs and trawlers were endeavouring to slip the cables of the light cruisers and beach them. Trawlers, Drifters and Puffers were picking up German boats and officers and men.

The "Dorfflinger" sunk at 1445.

3.- The  parties ordered by me to be prepared before entering left the ships very promptly.

4.- The Marine detachments found no Germans on shore, and after patrolling the coast lines, returned to their ships between 2000 and midnight.

5.- The prisoners already in small craft, and these picked up by the beats of the Squadron, were collected on board the battleships, to the number of about 1,820, and the following orders issued respecting them :-

A.C., 1st R.S., to 1st B.S., and Captain (D), 1825, 21st June, 1919.

"I consider that  by their act of treachery the German 

"prisoners of war have forfeited all claims to consideration

"other than the bare requirements cf humanity dictate. They "are to be treated with the utmost strictness.    Officers are "to be treated similarly to the men except that they are to be "kept apart from them. Any officer or man speaking t a "British Officer is to salute him. Men are to stand to "attention when they or their quarters are being inspected by a "British Officer.

REASON FOR FIRST BaTTTJB SQUADRON BflING AT SEA.On Thursday, 19th June, in pursuance of general orders from the Commander in Chief, Atlantic and Home Fleets, it had been my intention for the First Battle Squadron to carry out Long Range Torpedo Firing.      a copy of my orders   for this praotioe had been forwarded to the Commander in Chief, Atlantic and Home Fleets, on 17th June, and hi3 approval was further requested in my message 1015 of 18th JuneMessage from A.C. 1st B.S. to Cin C 1015 of 18th June.&quot;Request....&apos;
Pape 13.&quot;Bequest permission to carry out Lour Kan/re Torpedo &quot;Firing to-morrow, Thursday, or first&apos; suitable day&quot;.In his messages 1509 and 1615 of 18th June, the commander-&amp;-Chief. approved ray proposal, and in the last message he directed the practice to he completed durin/r the week-ending Saturday, 21st June, if possible.Message from C-in-C. to A.C&quot;, 1st 13.6&apos;., 1509 of 18th June.&quot;Your 1015 approved&quot;.Message from O-in-C to ^,0., 1st B.iJ., 1615 of 18th June.&quot;Your 1044 (?) approved.  Practice should be completed &quot;this week if possible&quot;.2.-     On Thursday, 19th June, thestate of the weather rendered it impracticable to carry out the practice.   This was reported to the Oonuaander-in-Chiei in my message 0930 of that date :-Message from ^.0., 1st i^.G. to C-in-C. 0930 of 19th June.&quot;My 1015 of 18th instant.

I had seen in the Press that the time limit within which the Germans &quot;ere to si^n the Peace Treaty had been extended to 19o0 Monday, 23rd June.4.-     No reply was received to this last message and none was expected as tne Commander-in-Chieffs instructions contained in his&quot; message 1615 of loth June (see paragraph 1) constituted sufficient authority for carrying out the practice provided it was completed by the end of the week, i.e. on Saturday, 21st.5.-     As the weather was . favourable on Saturday, the First Battle Squadron and 9 Destroyers left the base at 0900 and pro-ceeded to carry out the oraclice off Duncansby Head.Since my assumption on 18th May of the control of the German ships.

Occasional visits of his staff officers to other ships had also been obviously necessary in order to make the arrangements for the repatriation of 2&apos;,200 officers and men, and took place with my authority, which was given on each occasion.5,.-     The only exception to the correct conduct of the German officers and men&quot;was on 31st May, the anniversary of the Battle of Jutland.   On this occasion the &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and&apos; &quot;Moltke&quot;, and the majority of the destroyers, arranged some decorations with flags., including the German Ensign and the red flag.   I ^ave orders that no German &quot;Ensign or red flag was to be&quot; in sight irom outboard, and that no dressing ship was&apos; permissible-.   These orders were carried out after a display of force, but a few Yery&apos;s Lights were fired from certain destroyers at midnight.6,r     I had no anxiety that any gross breach of the armistice would be committed until possibly &quot;the last moments before the German representatives were required to sign the Treaty,7.-     I had, however, considerable anxiety as to the. possibility of damage being done to the German ship? either -(i) In the event of the Treaty being signed, during the interval between the signing of the Treaty and the repatriation of the German officers and men;   or(ii) In the event of the Treaty not being signed, before I was able to assure the surrender of the ships.8.- . In my letter No. 280/112 of 16th June I had submitted my views to the Commander-in-chief who had approved them in his telegram 1550 of 19th June, and I had issued orders to put them into&apos;execution.9.-     I would observe that the word &quot;may&quot; (paragraph 2, Clause 2, procedure (a), of my 1st Battle Scjuadron Memorandum llo. 280/ 107 of 19th June, 1919;, had, after receipt of the approval of the Commander-in-Chief to my proposals, been verbally altered, at a meeting at wMoh Rear Admiral Hon.

The Roar Admiral was informed that his application had been sent.   .    .&apos; 4,- The unhealthy appearance of Rear Admiral Von Reuter and his nervous and nighly strung manner, while on board E.M.S. &quot;R?VIi]NGE&quot; as a prisoner, corroborated the medical report of his condition.5,- After the sailing of the First Battle Squadron on the morning of the 21st June, the translation of a-message which had arrived on board while HAS. &quot;REVENGE&quot; was weighing, from Rear Admiral Von Router was brought to me.He requested the immediate forwarding, on account of its great importance, of a message to the following effect :-. &apos;   To Imperial Defence Minister, Chief of Admiralty. Chief of Baltic Station, Chief of North Sea Station, 2lst June.&quot;In the English; papers I have to-day perceived that in &quot;the German counter-proposal the Government intend to use the &quot;interned ships as ah object of trade.  TVen if economical &quot;distress is so ^reat as this, my feelings of patriotism and &quot;honour cannot accommodate themselves to &quot;such a treatment of the &quot;interned German Hoot.   In this view of the matter I am assured &quot;of the support of all the Officers of /the Squadron.  Accordingly &quot;Inrequest that a new adjustment of the Peace Terms may be caused &quot;or, if this is not attainable, that wo Offrce^s and officials &quot;may be definitely relieved before the surrender,.(Sgd.) Rea^ Admiral Von Renter&quot;,6,- Deeming this communication to be of sufficient importance to necessitate reference to the Commander-in-Chief and being at the time fully engaged in manoeuvring the First Battle Squadron and Destroyers during Torpedo exercise, I deferred dealing with it until return to harbour, but it is to be observed that it is dated 21st June, and must have been written a few hours before the decision was made and the order given to sink the:.ships.7.- . It is noticeable, from the copy of the Rear AdmiralTs orders, dated 17th Juno,  hat his previously formed intention had been to sink the ships only &quot;if the enemy wishes to take &quot;possession of thorn without approval of our Government.   If our &quot;Government has agreed in the Treaty to the ,handing over of the &quot;ships, then they will be surrendered, to the lasting shame of&apos; &quot;those who have placed us in this situation&quot;.8,-   Irom evidence in the log of the &quot;BADEN&quot; it appears that no preparative signal was made, and that the definite orders (which owing to trie large area covered by the ships and to intervening&quot;islands would require a considerable time before being generally received), to sink the ships, was given at 1120.P - The
, 305Page 16,FIRST BATTLE SQUADRON LCTTTR No,506/281 dated 34tft . June 19 iJLP.- The view that tho order wan entirely unexpected is borne out by the facts of no sabotage having taken place in the ships, other than that required to ensure the!v rapid sinking, the condition of Officers cabins and mon*s living spaces which showed that trunks and bags had been packed in a great hurry, and that in some ships the mid-day meal was found untouched on the tables.10,- While a prisoner on hoard E.M.S0 nRSOJG^u the Rear Admiral asked to see tho Interpreter, and made the following statement to himHo said that he did not understand why Admiral Frcmantle considered it an act of treachery to sink the ships as he understood that the Armistice was at an end when he did so,He wrote the letter received on Saturday morning the previous evening, having seen in an English paper that in the German counter-proposals the Government wished to use the interned ships as objects of trade (barter).On Saturday morning, he saw in another English paper that the Allies refused the&quot;counter-proposals and that therefore the original naval terms were not changed0  Therefore? not having been informed of tho extension of the period for signing of peace terms, and considering the Armistice at an end, he personally gave the order to sink the ships.A previous order at the beginning of the war had been given, by him that.no German man-of-war was ever to be surrendered to an enemy.He informed Admiral Fremantle that he. Von Reuter, could not understand it being called an act of treachery to sink his ships and he stated subsequently that he considered that he should have been informed of the extension of the time allowed for signing the Treaty.He stated that he had acted consistently during his command of the interned ships in an honourable and upright manner and had been treated in a corresponding mannerHe would have done it (sunk trie ships) whether the British Admiral had been in harbour or out of harbour.(Admiral Von Reuter had never received any communication from me regarding the date of termination of the Armistice, or with any reference to the terms of the Peace Treaty generally).11.-   From tho above evidence , I have formed the view that Rear Admiral von Reuter made his decision hastily and under the two extraordinary misapprensions, for which, as far as I am aware, ho had no justification whatever :-(i) That his own Government intended to use the interned ships as an object of trade.(ii)That the Armistice was at an end.I am of opinion that while mentally fully responsible for his action, for which he himself, the Officers and&apos;men who obeyed his orders, and his Government which he represented, must accept the full consequences, present and future, Rear Admiral von Reuter was not in a normal condition of health, and that his physical condition strongly affected his conduct.VIII.

A III.-5332. Berlin,9 May 1919.MOST SECRET..nSir, you have repeatedly expressed to Commander Stapenhorst the [wish of tho Interned ships&apos;(Internierungs Vorhand) to be informed as ; toiheir fate and the probable termination of their internment.The fate of this, the most valuable part of our fleet will pro-fbably be finally decided in the negotiations for a preliminary peace, I now being carried^on.From press news and utterances in the British House of Lords, it [appears that our opponents are considering the idea of depriving us I of the Interned Ships on the conclusion of peace: they waver between i the destruction or the distribution among themselves bf these ships, :ne British naturally raise some doubts about the latter course, GJhese hostile intentions are in opposition to the hitherto I unquestioned German right of ownership&quot;of the vessels, with&apos; the i internment of which we complied on the conclusion of the Armistice ; only because we were obliged to consent, for the dur tion of the Itoistice, to an appreciable weakening of the striking power of the Eta an Fleet,This assumption was freely expressed and was not contradicted by the enemy aither at the conclusion of the Armistice or on nts j prolongation . We, on the other hand, have io ft en repeated this I interpretation, when we protested in February 1919 against the unjustified internment in an enemy harbour, designating this to be a contravention of the terms of the Armistice and demanding the subsequent I removal of the ships to a neutral harbour;   this protest, it is true, remained unanswered.Sir,  you may rest assured that it will be no more than the plain dufty of our Naval Delegates at Versailles to safeguard the fate of ; our interned ships in every way, and to arrive at a, solution which is 1 in accordance with our traditions and our unequivocal German rights. 1 In this connection, the first condition will be that the ships I remain German, and that tneir fate, whatever turn it may take under I the pressure of the political situation, will not be decided without lour co-operation and will be consummated by ourselves, and that their I surrender to the enemy remains out of the question.  We must hope i that these just demands may retain their position in the scheme of - our political standpoint.in the question of peace as a whole.I beg you, Sir, as afr as possible to express to the officers and jkrews of the.Interned Ships my satisfaction that, for their part, they   are so eagerly nursing our most natural hope, that the Interned Ships will be retained under the German flag, and to communicate to I them our strong desire to make our/rattse triumphant.   This spirit is calculated to support the German Delegates in their efforts at the : Peace Conference/ The fate of the whole Navy will depend upon the I results of these.efforts; it is to be hoped that they will&apos;out an lend to the internment which, through our enemies1 breach of faith, lias become so cruel, the sufferings and trials of which are deplored jby our whole Navy, and which will &quot;&quot;be remembered to the credit of the linterned crews.
