PENSIONS   MEDICAL TREATMENT AND TRAINING OFBKITISH PENSIONERS in the DOMINIONS AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES.I desire to submit the following Memorandum for the consideration of the Cabinet.(Sgd.)   L. Worth!n&amp;t ou- vans .2nd July, 1919.I have had occasion to consider the arrangements made for the administration of Pensions, Medical Treatment and Training of men discharged from Imperial Forces and for the widows and dependants of men of those Forces killed in the present war, who are resident in the Dominions or in foreign countries, and I find them to fce extremely unsatisfactory.Canada and the United States furnished by far the largest number of recruits to the Imperial Forces, and may conveniently, therefore, be taken to exemplify the existing arrangements.   It is common knowledge that in addition to British Reservists resident in Canada, who were under obligation to join the Imperial Forces, a very large number of Canadian residents enlisted in British Regiments at the outbreak of war, and I am informed by the Canadian Authorities that over 50,000 men resident in Canada joined the Imperial Forces in this manner.   The number of men similarly recruited in the United. States cannot be stated, but certainly amounted to several thousands.   The number of British pensioners resident in Canada who are known to the Ministry is not more than 1,300 of whom 370 are widows and dependants and in the United States of America 373 men and widows and dependants 157 .After making allowance for those portions of this force that did not reach tho actual scane of military operations (e.g. the bulk of the Air Force) and for a large number who took commissions in the Imperial Forces and allowing also for the fact that deficiency of shipping and other causes may have tended to prevent the full number of pensioners with Canadian domicile being as yet imown to us, ib is to be expected that (on the analogy of the proportion of pensioners per cent of British troops, namely about 12) the number of British disabled men pensioners in Canada may be 2,000 to 4,000.The present system of dealing with disabled men ?:nd the claims to Pension of widows and dependants under the Royal 1&apos;jarrant, who are resident in Canada and the United States, is seriously defective in two respects:-(a) The existing arrangements of the &quot;Ministry do not secure to these men and to widows and dependants the same rights and advantages that are secured for British pensioners resident in this country, and(b) The rates of Pension and Allowance under the Royal Warrant are for the most part markedly less favourable than those payable under the Canadian Orders-in-Council.Under present arrangements a single agent of the Ministry stationed at Montreal acts on our behalf in paying. Pensions to such persons as the Ministry have cognisance of, and the Ministry actthrough
through this a?ont to secure the medical examination, of disabled men cn the occasion of the re-assessment of the pension.     This arrangement is obviously inadequate, since under it existing pensioners have no means of appealing against or obtaining a review of, -their assessments, and claimants to Pension have   no local machinery for getting a hearing of their cases or right of appeal, If on reference to the Ministry a claim is rejected. Moreover, reference to the Ministry in other cases before even a temporary award cr advance is made inevitably involves prolonged delay.Again, in the matter of medical treatment, provision of Artificial Limbs and Appliances and Industrial Training, the British pensioner in Canada is less favourably situated than a pensioner in this country,   Reciprocal arrangements have been made between the Ministry and the Canadian Authorities for the treatment and training of British pensioners in Canada, but the rates   of allowance payable under the Warrant do not enable men to   take advantage of the facilities provided.Finally, there is nc equivalent available to the British pensioner or claimant to Pension in Canada, of the machinery of discretionary assistance in cases of hardship which is provided by the Special Grants Committee,With regard to the rates of Pension and Allovanee, strong representations have been made to me as to the inequality   of treatment as between British pensioners in Canada and pensioners of the Canadian Forces.   Owing to the high cost of living prevalent in Canada, and to the higher rates of wages recognised in that country, even before the war, the rates of pension and allowance provided bv&quot; Canadian Orders-in-Ccuncil are commonly higher than are allowed by the Rcyal Warrants, and much discontent has been caused by the fact that the patriotic desire of Canadians to offer their services   to the Empire at the earliest possible moment by enlisting in Imperial Forces has resulted, in their being penalised by the grant of less favourable ccmpensation to them or to their dependants in cases of disablement and death.   The result has been that local charity has had to be called into remedy the defects of the Warrants,   I attach a table shewing briefly the differences between the rates of Pension and Allowances provided under the Warrants and by Canadian Orders-in-Counc 11.The position of British pensioners and claimants to pension in the United States is worse.   The Ministry of Pensions has no other agenc &apos; than the British Consuls and Vice-Censuls, who have necessarily no acquaintance with the scheme   of pensions or the treatment and training of pensioners, and are in any case too few and too scattered to be able to render more than occasional assiat-ance.   The Canadian Government, have made local arrangements for the handling cf their pensioners in the United States and it seems reasonable that we should take advantage of their organisation, use cf which has been offered to us.I am satisfied that these anomalies cannot be allowed to continue and.   I have, therefore, given careful consideration to the method by which they can best be adjusted.In order to secure for the British pensioner or claimant to pension in Canada even the advantages secured to the same classes in this country, it :/ould be necessary to set up in Canada not only a Central Office cr Branch Agency of the Ministry adequately equipped but to provide a local machinery throughout Canada corresponding with the system of Local Committees and Special Grants Committee in this country.The
The cost of this would clearly be disproportionately heavy and. the only  solution open to us is to make use of the Canadian Pension Administration with power as our Agent to provide for British pensioners and claimants to pensions in Canada the same pensions and allowances and other advantages at the same rates and by the same machinery as thoy are adminis-tered on behalf of Canadians chargeable to the Canadian Government.I recommend, therefore, that the following plan should he adopted ;(a) that British residents in Canada who enlisted in Imperial Forces should he allowed the option of taking pensions and allowances and Medical Treatment and Training and all other privileges at the same rates and on the same terms as are provided by Canadian Orders-in-Counsil In place of the rates of pension etc. accorded under Royal warrants. (An option is necessary as British pensioners havo rights under the Royal Jar-rants, but I propose that such option should be offered, and either accepted or rejected once for all on the-occasion of first claim to pension).(b) that the Canadian Pensions Administration (the Department of Civil.Re-establishment) be asked to undertake the investigation of claims to Pension and the medical examination of disabled men in accordance with the principle and practices of Canadian Orders. in-Council relating to pensions and to award pension cn my behalf and subject to confirmation by my Department in each case.     Provision for the necessary safeguards as to identification of beneficiaries required by the Appropriation Act, for the preservation of the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament, for the rendering of accounts by the Canadian Authorities and other details of the arrangement to be agreed with the Treasury.These terms would be applied to men and dependants of men only, not to officers - nd their dependants and men, widows or dependants returning to this country will revert to British pension rates.I propose that these terms should be accorded to men who were resident in Canada at the outbreak of war, but as the chief object Is to remove the disparity between pensioners of the Imperial Forces and the Canadian Forces it is for consideration whether it should not be extended to pensioners who subsequently emigrate.The estimated additional cost of the award of pensions on the basis Of Canadian Orders-In-Council, cn the assumption that the proportions will be men 6, widows 2, and dependants 2, is  37.10 per pensioner per annum.I ask the authority of the Cabinet to negotiate on these general lines with the Canadian Government and further to be empowered to enter into similar arrangements with other countries according as may appear to be justifed by the circumstances of each case.L. iiiEtMinister of Pensions,2nd July, 1919.
