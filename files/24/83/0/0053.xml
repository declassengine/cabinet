(P 3645)        From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,7th July 1919.. ,   Priority A.   Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s .Government have carefully considered your telegram of 29th June, but while they arc entirely in accord With views expressed in para. 1, they are inclined to favour, an alternative method of attaining desired result.  &apos;They approve plan of probationary period, but proposal to.negotiate in two stages appears to be.open to. following objections&apos;:---(I) Initial treaty, while claiming&apos;to be a Treaty of Peace, is in reality a Treaty of Penalties alone. &apos;(2) It offers Amir no definite inducement to sign, and imposes no definite obliga-tions on him if he does..     &apos; /       &apos; .::(3) At end of probationary period it will probably bo, found that stipulations in/ written statement have been only partially complied with, and a long discussion will ensue as to how far Afghan attitude has justified proposed renewal of friendship. In the end we should probably be compelled to overlook non-fulfilment or evasion of several of the conditions, or to break off relations. Indeed, the position would be both undignified and illogical, since we should already have concluded a Treaty of Peace six months earlier without waiting to see whether essential conditions were likely to be fulfilled.The real terms of peace seem to us to be contained, not in your draft Treaty, but in your six points ; and we would prefer therefore to incorporate them, with as precise a definition as possible, and with certain additions, in first draft of Treaty straight away. The Amir would get neither subsidy nor right to import arms until the probationary period has elapsed. Question might, of course, still arise whether terms had been strictly complied with. But there would be no need for second meeting of&apos; delegates, or renewal of negotiations1, sinceOnly points to be decided would be whether to grant.subsidy, and if so, what amount-, &apos;or whether to cancel Treaty altogether.&quot;&quot;-&apos; T&apos;&apos;;In these circumstances, ahchas&apos; alPprevious treaties.&apos;with Afghanistan have lapsed, it seems desirable to include in the new &quot;Treaty the whole of the conditions, which in our opinion should regulate the future relations of the two Governments. - Accordingly we suggest the following Articles :  &quot; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;rtT. Amir will hold no political relations with any foreign Power except the British Government. He will follow unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to his relations with all foreign Powers. &quot; II. If any foreign Power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on the dominions of Amir, the British Government will, be prepared to support Amir against such aggression to such extent as may appear to them necessary, and in such manner as they may deem advisable.&quot;III. The Government of India will at no time exercise interference in the territories lying beyond their frontier on the side of Afghanistan, and Amir will at no time exercise interference in the territories beyond this line on the side of India. The tribes on the Afghanistan side of the frontier shall not receive allowances from the British Government, and the tribes on the Indian side of the frontier shall not receive allowances from the Afghan authorities.&quot;IV. The frontier from the Nawa Peak to Sassoli shall follow the line shown in the map attached to this Treaty, and shall be demarcated by a British Commission, and Amir shall accept such demarcation.&quot;I recognise objections to appearance of annexation but it might be desirable to draw line so as to include rail-head at Kam Dakka or Loi Dakka for future Shilman or Kabul river railway, should this ever be constructed, but no mention of railway should of course be made.&quot;V. Amir shall co-operate with the British Government for the maintenance of peace and order upon their common frontier and for the removal of outlaws and notorious raiders, and shall instruct his officers accordingly.&quot; iAs it should be recognised that forme]1 treaty relations arc definitely extinguished it is desirable that new Treaty should be self-contained, and further clauses should be
interpolated at this point providing for your stipulation (1) and for improvement of position of British representative in Afghanistan as in your stipulation (5) ii you can indicate definitely the improvements desired. Otherwise such provision does not appear worth while.Your stipulation (6) appears unnecessary and also undesirable as it might be interpreted by Amir as admission of his claim to full position of an ambassador for his. eiivtry and would almost certainly be followed by demands of such a nature. v Stipulation (3) should be obtained if possible in negotiation, but not included inTreaty. &apos;Last two articles of Treaty should be as follows.: &quot;British Government have decided, in consequence of wanton and unprovoked aggression of Amir, and in reparation for material loss and damage caused thereby, to treat as forfeited all arrears of subsidy of late Amir, and these will not in any circumstances be paid.&quot; British Government are, unable to continue to Amir privilege of maintaining an Afghan postmaster at Peshawar, in view of manner in which tins privilege has been abused.&quot; British Government are not willing to grant renewed subsidy to Amir, or to accord to him the privileges enjoyed by his predecessor in respect of importation of arms and munitions through India to Afghanistan, until such time as he shall have shown by his conduct that he is deserving of these proofs of confidence. If at the end of six months the Amir has satisfied British Government in this respect, and has faithfully observed the terms of this Treaty, they will be prepared to. grant to him a subsidy, to be hereafter determined, and to allow importation of arms.&quot;It may be found desirable in course of negotiations to agree to immediate grant of a greatly reduced subsidy, or to, make special money grant on moderate scale. But of this you will be, best judge. . , .  ,, Troops&apos;would be, withdrawn from Dakka on signature of Treaty, but there appears; to be, no need to mention this in Treaty.I: shall be glad to receive as soon as possible any observations you wish, to offer on the above, with a. draft of the proposed Treaty as revised. If there are any other provisions, not covered by above,, that you think desirable, please include them in draft for further consideration.
