In. view of the great importance of eeourlng that the prloea to be paid for any land acquired for. housing schemes snould be striotiy reasonable la amount, and of the fina^oiai liability of tne State, a oiroular letter was addsewd to Local Authorities on the 3nd of May requesting them in all oases before negotiating to apply to the office of the District Valuer of the Land Valuation Department for a valuation of the land selected.   The local Authorities were also reminded that, if desired, the Inland Revenue Valuation Officer would undertake negotiations for the purchase of sites.This procedure of obtaining Valuations is now generally adopted, and in many oases negotiations have been conducted by tne Valuation Officers with good results.(3) SiSS&amp;t iti &amp;atcrlala.   A memorandum has been issued to Local Authorities setting out In detail the arrangements for supplying through the Ministry of&apos;Uunitions certain materials required in oonneotion with housing sohemes.   The arrangements for the financing of and accounting for materials supplied in this way were also described.A Production Branch of the Housing Department is being constituted at the Board for dealing alto questions of material, labour, and transport, and a similar organisation will be set up in each Region under the Housing Commissioner. The responsible officers *lll *orfc in liaison with officers of the Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Labour, and the Ministry of  ays and Communications, so as to remove any difficulties wnlofc may arise as regards the supply of materials, labour, or transport.(4) Departmental Committees.   The 3ub-oommittee8 formed to consider u) the standardisation of methods and materials;
and the use. of now muxhoda andmaterialajconneotion rilth housing schemes, have Lad several Met Inge. The last-named ooE^ittee have already reported on oertain matters of finance, and it is anticipated %h&amp;i the committees on contracts and specificationsv.ill report shortly.(5) Parliamentary Housing Group.   Well attended meetings of the Housing Group have been held weekly during the month. The latest information as to the progress.of Housing was given bach week and authorixaxive .ata;eaenta In regard to prooiema arising -in connection with the better have been made by repreeeatativea of the Departments concerned, including ilr.

The district Housing Coituzdeeionera appointed by the Board attended one of the -meetings and explained whatwas being done in their districts; ^number of membera.took the opportunity of getting into personal touoh ;rith the Commissioners for their constituencies. Many important questions were discussed at the meetings and helpful suggest ions made.    Members seta asked to hold oon-feranoea during the reoees and in a aumbar ef oases information has been supplied to them for use in this connection.^6) Rousing Sojiejtgjh   During the ruontb of iiajr. 8*6 sites were submitted by Looal Authorities; and Public Utility So oiet is a for the Bawd1 a,  approval, making a total of 1907 up to the 31et May (exclusive of a number which had been withdrawn or bad been rejeotsd as unsuitable or for other reasons).   The total area comprised in these sites was about 3.5.,000 acrae which could provide roughly for aome 350,000 houses.   ?&amp;e number of sites approved  *e 544, covering about 9,000 acres.The total number of applications, up to the end of May, for approval of lay-out a was 377, of tnion tas Board had approved 133.^ vHouse plane fox 13,318 houses in all had been submitted and of&quot; these the Board h*d given approval for 4,739 houses.&apos; -Fuller details are given in Appendix 1.(7) Aoquijtition of Land.   A Memorandum has been sub-mitt sd to the Tar Cabinet dealing nth the limitations of the Aoijuisition of Land (Assessment of Compenaation) Bill, 191S, and suggesting tnat certain matters, particularly in relation-to the oompuleery acquisition of land, tfhicb Cannot be dealt with in that Bill should form the subject Of a nev,&apos; Bill..
\TI.   HEALTH.(l)   Ministry of Health Act.   The amendments laade by the House of Lords in the Ministry of Health Bill were considered by the House of Colons on&apos;the 26th of May and all were accepted other than that which provided that one rarliamentary Secretary only should be appointed and another conseouential amendment. The amendment was, however, insisted upon by the House of Lords and subsequently accepted by the Kouse of Commons and the Bill was paeeed and ieceired the Royal Assent, oh the 3rd of June.An order in Council fi;-:ing a date for the coming into operation of certain provisions of the /.ct is in preparation. It is proposed that the . inistry of Health shall come into being and take over all the functions cf the local Government Board, at a very early date*( )   Smallpox.   During the month cases cf this disease have been reported in districts not hitherto affected.   In several instances the disease was introduced from abroad, in some cases by demobilised soldiers.   In no district has the disease so far become epidemic;   the season cf the year is unfavourable to epidemic prevalence of the disease.   In some districts the occurrence of cases apparently unconnected with one another, in which the source of infection has not been traced, gives ground for uneasiness.   Should cases continue to occur-through the summer and autumn, the disease may easily assume an epidemic character at the end of the year.The matter is receiving close attention by the Medical Department.   Advice is given to local health officers and infected localities are visited by medical Inspectors when this is thought advisabl-e.   During the month j&amp;edical Inspectors, visited the Isle of Wight, Croydon, Gra^esend and Southampton.Vaccine lymph is supplied to public Yaccinators end Medical Officers of Health on receipt of telegraphic or written application to the Government Lymph ISstablishwent.(3)   Habies.   It has been considered desirable to supplement the treatment centres that have been already established at Plymouth and London by others at Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester and :&apos;ewcastle-on-Tyiie.   Vaccine for the use of these centres will be prepared at the Board&apos;s pathological laboratory in London instead of being obtained from the Pasteur Institute, Paris.   One of the Board&apos;s pathologists has visited Paris to confer with the authorities of the Pasteur Instit^tensnd the.Board have also arranged ^ith Sir D. Semple that his services shall be available as a consultant in the preparation of the vaccine.   The 3oard have agreed to supply the Local Government Beards for Scotland and Ireland with any anti-rabic vaccine that ^ay he required in either of these countries.(4)   liccca Pilgrimage.   With reference to the note on this subject in the report for April, it has now been considered desirable that an officer of the Board should proceed to Egypt I     and, after local investigation, report on the subject.Dr. Wilkinson, one of the Board&apos;s Medical Inspectors, has been seconded to the Foreign Office for the purpose and has left for Egypt.
(5)   International control,of, disease.   This subject has assumed importance in connection with the&quot;proposed League of Nations, and Dr. Euchanan, the  Board&apos;9 acting Medical Officer, has gone to Paris to confer generally on the subject.The widespread prevalence of typhus fever in Central Europe ha3 engaged the attention of the Board and they have expressed their entire concurrence with representations for international assistance to combat the disease which have been made by a Conference of Red Cross Societies which met at Cannes. The Board have suggested to tho Foreign Office that the Army Council might assist by placing hoopital material and equipment ;*t the disposal of the Bed Cros^i and by lending the services of sanitary officers and others conversant with the latest&apos; methods of preventing the spread of infection.(6)   ftag Plock Act, 1911.     In consequence cf repres-eirta tiers as to lack of uniformity m&quot;the administration of this Act the Board issued a Circular to Local Authorities on the 26th of May drawing attention to legal decisions on certain points cf difficulty and urging that tho provisions of the Act and the Bcard*s regulations should be effectively carried out.(7)   &quot;Venereal Diseases.     By the end of the month of May, 145 Main Treatment Centres&quot;for &quot;Venereal Diseases were open, an increase of 4 during the month, and further facilities for -treatment have been provided by the opening of additional Auxiliary Centres and by the holding of additional clinics at some cf the Main Treatment Centos.   A31 the; information received by the Board shews that the number of attendances of patients at Centres is markedly in advance of the corresponding figures for the previous yeai.(Q)   Tuberculosis    The total number cf beds for the treatment cf tuberculosis in institutions approved by the Board for this purpose is 13, 841, an increase of 180 during the month. Proposals for the provision of some 600 f-urthssrbeds were received in the Month of May.At the end cf the month of April, 269 discharged men and 1,722 insured persons were on the waiting list for admission to sanatoria and hospitals.   The number cf vacant beds in institutions at the same date wa3 315.(9)   Maternity and Child Welfare.    During the past month the Board have approved proposals by&quot;55 Local Authorities for extending their schemes of maternity and child welfare.   In 5 of these cases .the extensions include the acquisition cf premises for hospital, creche and maternity and. child welfare purposes:; and in 2 cases loans amounting to  9,259 were sanctioned.   The Board also directed local inquiries to be held by their Inspectors into 4 applications for sanction to loans for maternity and child welfare purposes.   In a number of cases the Board&apos;s Inspectors have/made informal inquiries into proposals to purchase premises out&apos;of revenue.During the month the number of municipal Health Visitors was increased by 38;   the number of District Nurses employed as part-time Health Visitors by Local Authorities by 10; and the number of Municipal Infant Y/elfare Centres by 16.
W   Public ^orks.    There has been a large increase in the number ot applications received by the Board from Looal Authorities, for sanction to loans for public works.   During the month of May the applications received numbered 210 as compared with 117 in March and- 139 in April.The, total amount of ihe loans sanctioned during the month was  825,000 an increase of  108,000 over the amount sanctioned in April.   The principal purposes for which loans were, sanctioned were - electricity undertaking.? ( 356,000), sewerage and sewage disposal ( 117,000), street improvements  91,000), gas undertakings ( 84,000), land settlement of ex-service men ( 55,000) and  water supply ( 42,000).Applications for sanctions to leans were refused in two   cases only, the total amount involved being  9,400.The leans sanctioned for the purchase by County Councils of land for the settlement of ex-service men have now reached a^,total of  103,000 for the purchase of estates with a total area bfvabout&apos;. 2&quot;;&quot;2Gv acriv.It was stated in the report for the month of March that the board&apos;s Engineering Inspectors were visiting the places where unemployment was reported to be most serious in order to stimulate the Local Authorities to proceed with public works;   and a white paper (Cmd.140),   a copy of which was appended to the report for the month of April, was subsequently issued indicating the progress made up to the end of   the latter month.   The work of.cur Inspectors in this matter has been continued&apos; during May, although, owing to other demands on their time, fewer places have been visited.   A return is annexed (appendix 2) bringing up to the 31st May the information contained in Table II of the White Paper..In order that the President may be able to estimate to what extent the operations of Local Authorities are aiding in the re-establishment of industry a circular has been issued to all County Councils and all Councils of Boroughs and Urban Districts having a population of over 20,000.   The circular a3ks these authorities to furnish at the beginning of each.month of the present-financial year, a return.in respect of works conmenced during the preceding months which involve an estimated expenditure on labour or materials or both.of  1000 and upwards during the present financial year.   The .return will shOT the nature of the work;   the estimated expenditure during the financial year;   the estimated labour required in man-week units (a iaan-v/eek unit * the employment of one man for one week) and .tJae probable duration of &quot;the work.In order to secure the provision by Local Authorities of the maximum amount of work as soon as possible, sanctions to loans,are now being issued subject to the understanding that the works will be put in hand at once and Local Authorities are required to inform the Board when they have actually bean commenced.
In addition to the amounts mentioned above the Board have sanctioned the raising by Boards of Guardians of loans amounting to  10,000 for the purchase or improvement of Institutions.They have also given sanction for tho Metropolitan Asylums Board to proceed with their scheme, approved in August, 1914, but discontinued owing to the war, for additions to the Tooting Bee (imbecile) Asylum at a total cost of about  172,000.(2)   Third Register of Electors.    An Order in Council was made On the 8th of May f xing^as&quot; the qualifying period   for the Third Register the six months ending on the 15th of June.   The 4At.e for fch$ j&amp;bjica tion. of.. the electors lists in England and &quot;Wales will be&quot; &quot;the&apos; 19th of-July and the Register will come into force On the 18th cf October.   Certain special previsions as to voting by absent vcters put in f..rce temporarily by the previous Orders in Council have been made permanent..(3)   Duties of District Auditors.   A departmental Coicmittee was appointed last year td revise the Instructions relating to the duties of District Auditors.   A draft of the Instructions prepared by the Committee was referred to each Auditor and Assistant Auditor and as a result many useful criticisms were received.   The Instructions as finally revised by the Committee have been adopted by the Board and ^ere issued at the end cf last month (May) to the District Auditors.In issuing these Instructions for the guidance cf District Auditors, the Board soaxe that the primary object of the Instructions is to secure a thoroughly efficient audit based on the best known methods * &apos; They sta&amp;e that audit by District Auditors has been instituted mainly for the protection of the , ratepayers and that the intention is that the audit should encourage sound methods in all financial transactions, should check illegality and extravagance, snl should secure the proper realisation and application of&apos;all income, and, above all, should as far as possible, prevent fraud or waste of public funds.The instructions made it clear that the Auditors are to endeavour to secure that the accounts are $opt in such a way as to shew the true financial position and emphasise the point that where trading undertakings are concerned the account keeping should   be on commercial lines.(4)   Var Bonuses *   A Circular has been issued informing Local Authorities of the new scale of War Bonuses which the Treasury have recently authorised for permanent Civil Servants. The Circular suggested that Local Authorities generally might, take this amended scale as a guide svhen considering the award of Var Bonuses to./their employees. It was also suggested that differences between Local Authorities and their employees should be referred for settlement to the Chief Industrial Commissioner&apos;s Department, Ministry of Labour.(5)   Welfare of the Blind.   A memorandum was submitted to the Cabinet oiS the subject &quot;of Grants in Aid of the Blind, and the Cabinet subsequently decided that, a sum of  125, OCO. should be allocated as between Sngland and !/7ales and Scotland to be
disbursed *y way.of grant in aid of the aerrloea       to. Blind m*ntinned in the minutes of the Comalttee.   This is an interim gran  pending legislative treatment of th. whole profle* of thi Blind.   The cervices to he aided are (l) rorkshcps, (2  home workers attached to workshops,   3) home a ^d hostels, U) home-teaching, (5) hook production and (6) miscellaneous cervices.(6) Old Affe Pensions^   The number of appeals made to the Board against decisions of Local Pension Committees or Sub-Committees has increased considerably since March, 1916,, and there is at present no indication af any reduction. The total for the year ended karch, lvl9, was over 7,000 an increase of 67$ over the average for the three years ended March, 1916.   During Lay 635 appeals were received, compared with 591 in the previous month and 533 in the month of May, 1918.   Despite the increased number of appeals the balance on hand has been reduced since the end of Karen last from 1,154 to 1,040.   The number disposed of in April last was 659 and in May 731, as against 491 and 498 respectively in the corresponding months of 1918.(7)   Relief of War Distress. The grants made from the National Relief Fund upon therecomtaendation of the Government Committee during the month, were as follows:-To Local Representative Committees for the provision of direct assistance (including  4140 to Representative        Committees in East Coast Districts) .............       8390To Local Representative Committee for the Relief of Aid Raid Distress .............................        575To the Central Charities Committee for the Relief of repatriated civilians..................      1500Por the relief of distress among the professional classes..............Total 13020Applications were received from a number of the Canadian Fund Committees under the special East Coast relief scheme for grants to enable them to deal with applications from lodging-house keepers for assistance by the payment of rent or mortgage interest up to the end of last liarch quarter.   On the 29th of May a letter1was written to the Committee of the National Relief Fund recommending that grantB amounting to  19,350 should be made to fourteen Committees, leaving applications from three Committees still under consideration.In practically all cases the grants required are substantially less than for the corresponding period last year, and, in view of the prospect of a good season in the East Coast resorts this year, it is hoped that it will not be found necessary to continue the operation of the scheme.A letter has been receiTed from the Sub-Committee of the Bast Coast Conference drawing   tetntjion to those cases of lodging-house keepers who have been obliged;to part *rith their furniture, which is absolutely necessary if they are to resume2555
their letting thie year.   The Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that before these persona are able to entertain applications for rooms they will require assistance to enable them to replace their furniture and to do what is necessary in the way of repairs &amp;c to the premises.    It is thought that a sum of  10,000 would enable them to deal with the most urgent oases of this kind.   The Government Committee have written to the Coxamlttoa of th;* national Relief fund strongly endorsing the application&apos;and recommending that a sum of  10,000 should be set aside for the purpose.(8)   Assistance to Aliens.   The Board have asked the Treasury for authority to inform board of Guardians that the existing arrangements in regard to Government allowances and repayment of relief granted tc destitute -aliens may be continued at least up tc the end of the quarter which includes the date of the termination of the War.(9) Military occupation of Poor Law premises. During the month another 1&amp;,000 Teds in Poor Law Institutions which have been in use as Military Hospitals have been handed back to Poor Law Authorities, bringing the total known to be vacated or-in process of being vacated to 26,600 and leaving some 46,600 still in the occupation of the military Authorities.(lO)   Public Assistance.   The ^oard have been informed of a proposal for the leasing for five years of the St. Luke&apos;s Infirmary, belonging to the Bradford Beard of Guardians, to the Bradford Corporation, tc be used by the Corporation as a Hospital, after its-surrender by the Military Authorities (who have been occupying it as a Military Hospital).   The proposal is that the Guardians shall obtain from the Corporation an undertaking that their duties, so far as concerns the provision of hospital cr infirmary treatment for persons making application to them, shall be discharged in the Hospital, though no longer under the Guardians&apos; control.   Deputations from ths Guardians and the Corporation have been received by Officers of the Board, at which the difficulties were discussed and the matter is now the subject of local negotiations.(il)   Pauperism.   During the month of  April the number of persons receiving relief (other than lunatics in County and Borough Asylums, etc., casuals and persons receiving outdoor medical relief only) fell by 6,600 to a total of 457,000. This total is 9,400 less than the corresponding total at the end of April, 1916. &quot;;
