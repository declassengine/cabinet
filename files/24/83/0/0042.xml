From Viceroy, Foreign Department, ilk July 1910. (Received 5th.)982 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan.   Reference to my telegram 98.1 S.Second Part: &quot; As regards frontier tribes being inflamed and excited, and the demand that if they seek an asylum in Afghan territory they should not be allowed to remain there and should be ejected, 1 have understood this. I now write to Your Excellency that I was not particular cause of their being inflamed and excited. It is possible in some cases some of frontier officials of our Government did some things in opposition to certain actions of Your Excellency&apos;s. frontier officials, but in com-compliance with Your Excellency&apos;s earnest desire they have been warned to abstain from these ideas, and to take no such action iu future.&quot; As regards frontier tribes and others taking refuge in Afghan territory, it has been always the prevailing practice of the world that the extradition of persons taking refuge from territory of one Government into that of another is not allowed and an asylum is given to them. I would strongly urge Your Excellency to consider carefully how it is possible for me to expel and surrender such persons when this (corrupt &apos; group) law of nations and of humanity (? word omitted), Moreover, according to law of Islam it is quite (? unlawful) to refuse asylum to, and expel from country of Islam, people of any religion whatever who take refuge in it. These are matters for discussion in the peace meeting, which is to be convened between the two Governments, and it will be better to settle them there.&quot; I may point out to Your Kxcellency that it is no advantage and only a waste of time to get involved in such matters at such critical juncture: If it is intention of British Government to conclude peace what necessity is there then for worrying about such trifles. If there is no intention of making peace I request that I may be so informed so that we may understand each other. It has caused me much surprise that on one hand Your Excellency has indicated delight in agreement and unanimity, expressed a desire for the strengthening of relations, looking forward to a bright future, and given me glad news of re-establishment of friendly relations between two exalted Governments; while on the other hand you insist so strictly on unimportant matters referring to terms of temporary armistice which have no apparent advantage to Your Excellences Government as compared with friendship of Government of Afghanistan. This has made me somewhat uneasy at unexpected turn that affairs have taken. I write to Your Kxcellency with regret to say result of this state of affairs will be the avoidance of peace on my part also, otherwise I am not at all willing that the relations of unity and friendship which the sublime, independent Government of Afghanistan has for many years maintained with the illustrious British Government should be severed and converted into conflict and hostility. It is my earnest endeavour that relations of friendship and unity between the exalted Governments should be established more strongly than ever with honour to both parties.&quot;1 am glad to hear of appointment of Sir Hamilton Grant, Foreign Secretary, as chief of delegates of illustrious British Government, and trust that Your Excellency will communicate names of other delegates also for my information. The delegates of the sublime Government of Afghanistan whose names have already been communicated to Your Excellency are ready to start so that they may discuss matters with delegates of the illustrious British Government with a view to removal of the confusion and misunderstanding which has arisen between the two parties, the establishment of a clear understanding advantageous to both and the settlement of affairs in a manner honourable to the two exalted Governments. The numbers of persons who will arrive in India with, my exalted- honourable and dear brother Ali Ahmad Khan Sahib, Commissary for Home affairs of the sublime Government, will be 150, including attendants and military (escort) as follows, military, 30 cavalry, 50 infantry ; attendants 70.&quot; I hope Your Excellency will fix the date of their arrival so that they may arrive on frontier of illustrious British Government on that date.   Usual conclusion.&quot;Our comments follow.
