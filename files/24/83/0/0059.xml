This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.WAR CABINET.THE SITUATION IN RUSSIA. *Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note by M. V. Litvinoff-Falynsky oi49 who was formerly Assistant Minister of Commerce and a leading member of the Imperial 7354 Council of Defence, which had to do with the creation of war industries in Russia. He had great influence over the Grand Duke Nikolas Nikolaievitch and the Czar. He has the reputation of being a strong man and absolutely non-party, as he is more interested in economic and industrial questions, upon which subjects he has written books, than in politics.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.9th July, 1919.The political, economical and financial situation of Russia is such that without energetic assistance from outside she cannot rise to her feet. We, the Russian patriots who have never worked with the Germans, would notwithstanding our loyalty to the Allies, prefer to accomplish the regeneration of Russia independently, without foreign help. Unfortunately this is impossible and therefore there are two parties amongst those who look for foreign assistance: (1.) Those who expect it from Germany; and(2.) Those who want Allied assistance.m The first tendency will inevitably lead to another world war, the second will be the    jesurest foundation of the worhTs peace.   But Russia, exhausted by a long war and by the terror of Bolshevism does not want to &quot;be a tool for war in German hands, and * hence every patriotic Russian must look to the Allies for assistance.    As France is not able to help, we must turn to England, which. has a direct interest in the quickest re-establishment of order in Russia.England is the only country which is helping the Russian patriots wherever they are fighting, east and west, north and south, and Denikin&apos;s recent brilliant successes bear eloquent testimony to the efficiency of Englands help.   We earnestly hope that ..   this help will be continued.We view hopefully the military situation and we feel sure that the hour is near when the Russian Armies will, by force of arms, destroy the Bolsheviks, but we fear that all that Koltchak and Denikin will have done must perish unless the Allies help us to organize our economic life.The civil war has destroyed our economic apparatus; the transport system has collapsed, production has stopped, the industrial population has ceased to work, partly owing to the demoralization of the Bolshevist regime, partly owing to the impossibility H of getting raw material and fuel. The country is swamped with paper money whose purchasing power is rapidly vanishing whilst the cost of living is increasing in a fantastic ratio. Many articles of the first necessity cost now 400 600 even 1,000 times as much as they did before the war. The terrible cost of living leads to a further increase of wages and this again drives up the price of the most&quot; necessary articles. Under such conditions all production, all trade becomes merely speculation of the(B19/ 14)  70  7/19 H&amp;3  7303wo
wildest nature. Life in the towns is dead and only in the villages the peasants still do some work for the production of foodstuffs. But even this applies only to certain regions of Russia where owing to climatic conditions the production of foodstuffs is possible, whilst all over Russia the peasants lack fuel, light,&apos; clothing, iron, &amp;c. The towns are doomed to death through starvation because the peasants will not part with their foodstuffs for valueless paper money and the towns have nothing to give in exchange. Everywhere goes on a pitiless struggle between the moribund town popu-lation and the peasantry. In Soviet Russia grain can be extracted from the peasants only by means of machine guns.I maintain that the principal features of the economic picture are the same in Soviet Russia as in the territories re-conquered by Kolchak and Denikin. Especially the towns are for Kolchak and Denikin a terrible burden, which may destroy all that they have taken from the Bolsheviks, and the nearer they will get to the ruined centre of Russia, the more dangerous will be their position, the more acutely they will feel the economic disorganization in their rear, and this must in the long run lead to the disintegrate-tion of their armies. Kolchak&apos;s and Denikins efforts will be futile if immediate measures are not taken for creating more or less normal economic conditions in their rear. Kolchak and Denikin are powerless to do anything substantial in this respect; prompt and comprehensive assistance must come from outside. If England will not give this assistance, Kolchak and Denikin will perish, and then Germany will step in in her own way and the dying population of Russia will with the last gasp of self-preservation be compelled to turn to her.It is to England&apos;s greatest political, and economical advantage that she should promptly undertake the economical reorganization of Russia. I do not wish to suggest that England alone should undertake the solution of all economical problems of Russia, nor is this necessary. All that is wanted is that England should help to form an organization powerful enough to commence the re-establishment of our industries, our transport and the solution of some of our most intricate economical phenomena.Owing to the nature of the activities of our banks (very different from those of English banks) all the nerves of our economical life are centred in the banks. The banks were the regulating mechanism of our industries and our commerce, and there-fore they are the only apparatus by means of which economical order can be initiated..Many of the Russian banks were owned by the Germans, others were dependent upon them, and through the banks the Germans exercised their powerful influence upon Russia.The most important thing which England can do in her own interests and the interests of Russia is (1.) To assist in combining the majority of Russian banks into one powerful organization.(2.) In order to combat German influence in Russia to afford to such an organization .  her protection and influence.Both objects can be accomplished quickly. No assistance will be required on the part of the British Treasury, but it is essential that the British Government with a full knowledge of the political importance of such a measure, should extend direct protection and assistance to those private interests which aim at (1) combining all Russian banks into one organization ; (2) withdrawing the Russian banks from German influence; (3) bringing them within the sphere of British influence.If this is done, then Kolchak&apos;s and Denikin&apos;s cause can be considered safe, because the proposed organization will undoubtedly find powerful support in the widest business circles of England and obtain&quot; their close co-operation. Only then will such a combination obtain extensive credits on the part of financiers in all countries which are interested in the economic regeneration of Russia. Only such a combination will be able to carry out all that is necessary for the feeding and supplying of the starving population, the re-establishment of transport, industries, the exchange of goods, &amp;c. such an organization will not have, to ask for monopolies, concessions or privileges, because it will be actually supreme not only in the economic and financial domain in Russia but also in the political one in exercising its influence for the support of all those forces which work for the regeneration of Russia.In conclusion, I must cail attention to the exceedingly active work which is still being carried on by the Germans both in Russia and outside of it.   Their influence is
London,5th July, 1919.so great that some of the important posts in Kolchak&apos;s and Denikins Governments have been filled through their indirect influence by persons of Kussian origin but German orientation, A similar plan is now being attempted in the political entourage of General Yudenitch. The hidden hand of the Germans is felt in many directions and only the above outlined Anglo-Russian organization can successfully struggle against them. This organization would undoubtedly play a very great political part in support-ing the rising Central Government which to be strong and reliable must, above everything else, be independent of German influence.
