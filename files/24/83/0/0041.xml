From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 4th Juh/,\9\0.      : . .       -    J &quot;- .   (Received 5th, J.I a.in.) *.       : &apos;   . .Clear the line, -      -   .&apos; &apos; .. 1     r;./t981 S. Secret Afghanistan. Follb vingIVom General Officer Commanding; North-West Frontier, dated 3rd July&apos;:-- &apos; v &apos; ,       :. ,.v  - *   - &apos;&quot; 1st Pad. Alter compliments. &apos; Your Excellency^ friendly letter dated 22nd Ramazan, I;337 llijra, corresponding to 21st&quot;Juno 1919,. was received by :me on the 20th Ramazan, corresponding to (? 25th June), and was (? source) of augmentation of friendship and concord. I invite,Your Excellepcy&apos;s attention to my friendly and well-meaning ideas. The solo object of the two exalted Governments is to re-establish&quot; relations of friendship and concord between the two parties. Thus, when (? it omitted) is the intention of both parties in their mutual inierest to try and establish peace honourable to both Governments, it is necessary that both should devote attention to healing up of former wounds and to make an attempt to bring about a state.of affairs that may help to remove former misunderstanding and to firmly re-establish new friendship and unify, so that both parties may benefit by it.. Your Excellency&apos;s last letter, however, which has been quoted above, has not (ended to confirm the above views, and, as it does not correspond with the exigencies of the times, it has caused me some perturbation of mind and disturbed me. I have, therefore, considered it necessary to invite Your Excellency&apos;s attention to my wishes as to the armistice and to acquaint Your Excellency with what 1, as a well-wisher, consider desirable and advisable.&quot; As regards the first term that Afghan troops be removed to a distance of 20 miles from the nearest British force, 1 write to say that as I considered Your Excellency&apos;s idea of first (corrupt group) expressing a desire for peace and (corrupt group) it was Your Excellency&apos;s object to avoid bloodshed between the two exalted Governments, I believed and was convinced that Your Excellences intentions were good and rightly reasonable. 1 therefore became desirous of peace and asked for an armistice. At the same time, as I saw that Your Excellency was determined that Afghan regular troops should be removed to a distance of 20 miles from the nearest British force, I gave practical effect lo this provision in most parts of my territory, notwithstanding the fact that I had made no such promise in my letter to Your Excellency. I also gave orders to the troops on Chaman and Peiwar Kotal frontiers to take up their positions at a distance of about ten miles from your forces until the settlement of peace terms. Thus, in this manner, this request of Your Excellency was practically complied with in full. But, in response to my action in ordering my (? troops) be removed to a distance of ten miles in the limits of Peiwar Kotal and Chaman and (corrupt group) distance of 20 miles on my other frontiers, I consider it is necessary and advisable that the regular troops of the illustrious British Government should also be removed by Your Excellency from the new fort in the direction of Chainau to Chainan and from limits of Dakka to Landi Kotal and stationed at Maffey&apos;s former limit until the settlement of peace terms in order to avoid trouble of frontier raids, to allay extraordinary excitement prevailing amongst Afghan subjects and to prevent them from fighting. It is the rule of the world that when armistice and. peace aro arranged between&apos; two Governments the interests of both parties are kept in view, so it is not incumbent on one party to agree entirely to what the other party says. This is far fronj^ustice nor is (it) the law of the world. It is necessary for Yrour Excellency (to) consider this matter carefully. What need is there for Your Excellency (to) insist on this. Prolongation (of) correspondence distorting in such trifling matters will only lead to disturbance of feeling of both parties and have an effect, result of which would be that affairs will assume a different course and lead to misunderstanding and mischief, With clue consideration to the good intentions of and friendship between ,the two Governments, I do not consider that it is proper that such matters should be delayed.&quot; As regards movements of aeroplanes of Your Excellency&apos;s Government in Afghan territory, this is not at all necessary as there seems to be no advantage in it to the illustrious British Government. As requested by Your Excellency, stringent orders to the frontier tribes (by ?) Afghan Government have been issued strongly warning them that during the period of armistice no obtrusion or attack should be made by people within our country upon your troops. Your Excellency may entirely rest assured. The advent of your aeroplanes is certain to cause extraordinary excitement amongst our people, who will fire at them in spite of our strict orders not to.   The aeroplanes
will then bomb them as mentioned by Your Excellency. This will result in loss of life and property, the consequences of which would be very bad. Thus there will be no armistice (? or) peaceful settlement. Since both -Governments consider that conclusion of peace desirable and necessary in the interests of both parties, what need is there for bringing about such a state of affairs, and why does Your Excellency insist on this matter so much as it does not appear to be of any importance ? As the sole reason for the British Government sending aeroplanes is to reconnoitre and acquire information regaling $he state of affairs -in different directions round their eaiup and nothing else, this can be fully attained by flying aeroplanes above your own camp. M this is done, all agitation.and excitement amongst our people and exchange ^ of-shot and&apos; bomb between cur people, and your $ej/opla Lies will be avoided, and both parties -will remain iu peace and safety.&quot;In view of the safety erf both parties, I do not consider movement of your aeroplanes over parts of Afghan territory is adWsaMe in any case wliatexer.&quot;First part ends.
