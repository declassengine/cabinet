3- Document is the prcpor^l of,.j unnic Majesty&apos;s:Qotornnrt&amp;Ai * a o&apos; /   /,.   ;   / a ftFrom Viceroy, ilk July J9I9. (Received 5th, 10.45 a.m.)98-1 S. Secret. My 982 S. Afghanistan. Though there is much in AnnVs letter to which exception can be taken, yet it is clear that he is sincerely anxious for peace though he is striving to ignore his true position as unprovoked aggressor and suitor for peace, and to adopt an attitude of complete equality. &apos; Further peremptory letters will not move him from this. Resumption of hostilities might do, but would more probably lead to his flight or downfall and embarrassing consequences previously adumbrated. We recognise Amir has not strictly complied with letter of armistice terms, particularly term four, yet we believe that our wisest course to make the besta of his letter and to ask him to send in his delegates at once.We should then, at any rate, be able to ascertain through the real temper of the Amir and his advisers and the present conditions in Afghanistan, of which we are necessarily sadly ignorant. If we can by straight talk to his delegates, make the Amir see sense and accept our terms well and good, If the negotiations fail, we shall have proved to the world our sincerity and patience and can resume hostilities with a clear conscience. We propose then to address Amir as follows:-&quot;I am glad to learn how sincerely anxious you are for the restoration of peace. But my friend, both the whole tone of your letter and your advice that the British troops should now be withdrawn from Afghan territory on the Dakka and Chaman fronts force me to the conclusion that you fail to appreciate your true position. You appear-to forget that it was the Afghan Government that started this war and that it is the Afghan Government who are now suing for peace; and that it was for these reasons that armistice terms were laid down by my Government. You do not seem to realise His Majesty&apos;s Government have been very gravely affronted by what has occurred ; and that British people are indignant (? that a) (? great Power) should thus have been (group undecipherable) (? attacked). When I wrote to you of my desire for the renewal of the (? old) standing friendship between our Governments I did so on the assumption that having asked for peace you sincerely regretted what had happened and accepted, your proper position in the matter. I agree with you, however, that there is no advantage in prolonging this correspondence and that best course will be for our respective delegates to meet as soon as possible. Will you, therefore, please direct your delegates and their party to present themselves at the British lines before 10 a.ni. on 20th July. They will thence be honourably conducted by my officers to Rawal Pinch where arrangements for their entertainment will be ready. I shall be obliged if . you will let me know as soon as possible that you have issued the necessary orders in order that necessary arrangements may be made on this side: In -this connection you appear to suggest that your delegates will be accompanied in India by an escort of cavalry and infantry. This, however, is contrary to international practice and is not permissible. Every precaution for the safeguarding of your delegates will be taken by my officers. In these circumstances number of (? attendants) can doubtless be reduced, and I trust that you will limit their number to 50 persons.&quot;In addition to Sir H. Grant. Chief of British Delegation, I have appointed following to be my delegales : Air. Maffey, my Private Secretary, Brig.-Gen. Moberly, General Staff, Nawab Sir Mir Shams Shah and Sir Gurbaksh (? Singh) Bodi.&quot;We have advised as above on assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able to accept generally proposal in our telegram 954 S. of 29th June.
