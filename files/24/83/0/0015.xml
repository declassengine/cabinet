Generally faking, an early harvest and a light yield of straw is
anticipated. Meadow hay is nearly all cut and, though the weather had not been ideal for hay saving, there has been no prolonged rainfall to injure the crop. Yields, though not heavy, are in many places decidedly better than those of last year.

Attacks of potato ? are non reported from nearly every county, but the main crop is not, so far, affected. Spraying has begun, and the energies of the Department&apos;s agricultural staff are at present directed towards encouraging the general and thorough carrying out of this operation.

Strikes of farm labourers are in progress in parts of countries Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, and similar trouble is threatened in districts in counties Kilkenny, Wexford and Tipperary.

FLAX.

The temperature during the week has been abnormally low for the period of the year, Flax in exposed positions has suffered from the wind, and the crop generally has not made the progress that might have been expected if the weather had been warmer.

Labour. Large ?growers are again rather concerned to knew whether charged will be fixed for the pulling, handling and scutching of the crop. A resolution recommending that such charges should be fixed has been addressed to the Department by the Flax Millowners Association, and it is at present under consideration. The Department had hopes that it would be possible to have these matters arranged without Government intervention.
