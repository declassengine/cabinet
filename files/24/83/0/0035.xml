The present position of the French-Smith-Dorrien controversy and the political partisanship attaching to it in the House of Commons require further consideration by the Cabinet. Although I have hitherto endeavoured to parry, awkward arguments, I cannot feel that we can indefinitely maintain the position of refusing either to publish the facts ourselves or to allow the parties aggrieved by Lord French&apos;s hook to reply. The Liberal Opposition has put down a motion attacking Lord French. Lord Salisbury has written me the letter in the appended correspondence. Sir George Arthur is engaged in preparing Lord Kitcheners biography, which is to appear in the autumn. General Von Donop has visited me to ask permission to contribute his version of the shell shortage to Sir George Arthurs work. It would be a serious thing to refuse facilities to Sir George Arthur as the champion of Lord Kitcheners memory. On the other hand, General Von Donop&apos;s material will no doubt challenge, so far as possible, the early achievements of the Ministry of Munitions. Considerable party and personal feeling is inseparable from such a controversy.2. There is only one remedy that I can see, viz., the immediate preparation by the War Office and the Admiralty of a series of blue-books containing authentic documents bearing upon the various phases of the &quot;War. It would be easy to collect these and to present them in a fair manner with annotations by the Staffs which would render them intelligible and readable. The present Government have everything to gain by such publications. They have every -thing to lose by a continuance of the present state of things, i.e., isolated partisan publications by private persons, all of which, it can be claimed, have been provoked by Lord French, a member of the Government, coupled with unceasing reproaches that we have muzzled this or that aggrieved person and are trying to hide the truth.3. I ask, therefore, that a Cabinet decision shall be given (a) that this policy shall be announced, and (6) that drafts of these blue-hooks shall be prepared for Cabinet consideration before publication.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agrees with this view.WINSTON S. CHURCHILLUK July, 1919.(B19/304)  70 7/19 H&amp;S  7278-two
