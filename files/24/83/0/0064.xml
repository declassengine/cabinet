From Viceroy, 3rd July 1919. (Received 9th, 4 p.in.)975 S. Secret. Your telegram of 30th June. Afghan Mission to Peace Conference. We find it difficult to advise, in default of information, as to exact Baltic State in which and by whose orders Afghan Mission have been arrested. But if authority who have arrested them is amenable, it would seem desirable to get them handed over to us on ground that we control Afghan external relations and on the understanding that they would be treated with all respect and consideration and not as prisoners. This would impress Amir with length of our arm and hopelessness of trying to run on his own.
