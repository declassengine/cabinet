1  &apos; &quot;:&apos;ur\ is the Property of ^ rfcjfj^JX, s Government,3&amp;ADIRG WITH GERMANY. ) ^ ------------*Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.Simultaneously with the raising of the blockade of Germany, I propose:to take the fcllovdn,? action:-   % 1. Bemave prohibitions on trade with Germany underTTrading with the  nemy1 legislation. 2. Remove all regulations on general exports to Germany which do not apply to other countries for Conservation purposes (list C would, then be left applying only to Hungary and European Russia). 3. Make it a condition of the licenses under which limited quantities of prohibited imports are admitted that the goods brought in shall not be of German manufacture. (The&quot;legality of such discrimination is doubtful, but this risk has been run already in the case df other discriminations, e.g. Colonial Preference with regard to import restrictions, see Appendix). &apos;The position as regards imports will then be that goods not on the prohibits list may be imported from ;/ Germany; but the prohibited list has recently been increased with the object of extending the sfeield against German: competition for the time when trade should be resumed.The decision of the Cabinet is asfced for.A.C.GSDD3S.3.7,19.
