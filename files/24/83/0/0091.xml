ACCOMKOPATIOi! FOR MIHI3TRY Of HSALTH STAffF. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.fWith reference to the Memorandum dated July lot, G.T.7S98, of the j?iret Commissioner of &quot;Jorks on the General Question of Accommoda-tion for Government Departments in London, I viah to submit the follcvinf, observations: *(1) It is suggested that, on the removal of the ^dmir^lty Controllers Staffs from the few Public Offices., the Headquarters Staff of the Board of Trade, to the number of 1,100 should be&apos;accommodated in the building.While I appreciate the, importance to the. Board of Trade, of their staff ut uresent scattered, being housed in One building, I wish iacst strongly to urge that, in. view of the almost certain expansion of the Headquarters Staff of the ianietry, of Health, it would be extremely shortsighted policy to.place in the same building another Department, $hose staff is also likely to increase in numbers. If the course proposed is followed it will mean that when the staffs of the Board ii Education and the Office of ..orks have been provided for, every room in the Building will be occupied, and there will be no possibility of securing the additional accommodation which will be urgently required later v/hen the rork of the Ministry cf &quot;Health expands; expansion will- be inevitable later when the large programmes of Public Health Reform are oarried intl&apos;d effect..The- figure of 1,300 which, the First Commissioner of Works1 takes as the number to bo accommodated in ttfye ce.se of the Ministry of Health is a carefully ascertained figure to meet present minimum needs, which does not allow for any &quot;large expansion in the future,-I vrould therefore suggest that the available rooms should be allotted not ;to the Board of Trade, but to some Department whose staff is likely to be reduced in the future, or at any rate not likely to increase in numbers.(2) I should like to draw attention to the body to phieh has been entrusted during the war the responsibility for taking decisions jpn aocoaiatdatitn questions cf this sort, viz.&apos; the War Cabinet Committee-I en aco ommodation. &apos;This body is composed of a representative of the War Office, Admiralty, ministry of munitions and Office, of Works, and while the M war was in progress no exception could be taken, to these questions   m being dealt with by a Committee composed on these lines,,JTow, however, under Peace conditions I wish to submit that the existence of this. Body is no longer justified, and I think that all questions of Accommodation should be decided by the tfiret CpinmissionGr of hrorks as the Minister responsible to the Government y in this matter,0. AJDISO?!.in is try of Health.11.7.19.
