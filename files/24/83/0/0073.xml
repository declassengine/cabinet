Part V: Disputes.(a) Involving a Stoppaye of Work (6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The dangers of the present position from the point of view of the Ministry of Labour may be broadly summarised as follows: 1. Restoring Industry. The Governments policy since the armistice has been mainly directed towards stimulating the resumption of industry, with a view to providing employ-ment and meeting the financial position of the country. With this end in view, control has.been removed with great rapidity from a large number of industries, the excess profits tax has been reduced from 80 per cent, to 40 per cent., and the restriction of imports has been maintained. These measures have been very largely successful. Confidence has been created among the capitalists, which has induced them to restart their works on peace production as rapidly as possible, and has consequently made the absorption of the men demobilised from the Forces and from munitions work on the whole far quicker and easier than might have been expected.2. Profiteering-Oii the other hand, these very measures, which have created confi-dence on the side of capital, have only succeeded in doing so by forfeiting confidence on the side of labour, and it is this fact which constitutes the most serious factor in the present situation. At the present moment labour is in a very suspicious and resentful mood, which may be attributed to profiteering more than to any other single cause.There is no question that the result of decontrol and the diminution of the excess profits tax has been that large numbers of employers in almost every industry are making profits far in excess of not only what is reasonable, but of what they could hope to make under anything like normal conditions. The case of wool is a particularly notorious one. When control was removed, it was on the most explicit assurance from the manufacturers that prices would not rise, but would rather fall.   .Since the removal of control, however, prices have risen from 30 per cent, to 50 per cent, for most kinds of woollen manufactures, and there is every prospect of a further rise when, the demand for woollen goods in Eastern Europe begins to make itself felt.  It is,,(C 1830) 255  7/19 HAS APart I.-Dangers in the Present Economic Position.
in fact, stated that large quantities of goods are at present being withheld from the markets in expectation of this demand. The result is that prices are rising to an alarming extent. This is true not only of the woollen industry, but of almost every other industry which affects the domestic consumer. The position in the case of boots, furniture and most household utensils is similar. That prices are bound to be considerably higher than they were before the war is inevitable owing to the inflation of the currency, but neither inflation nor the rise in labour,costs due to increased wages and shorter hours will satisfactorily account in most cases for the prices now being charged. The effect of this on the minds of the working classes may easily be conceived. Every man and every woman is hit by high prices of domestic articles, which they know are largely due to excessive profits, and, if they had any doubts on the subject, they would be removed by the large profits which are being declared daily by industrial undertakings. For instance, a reel of cotton, which cost \\d. before the war, now costs 1\d., and the cotton is inferior.It is only necessary to look at Messrs. Coats&apos;s last balance sheet to see that a large part of this difference goes into their pockets. Pacts, of this kind are being sedulously propagated by the !i Daily Herald,&quot; and by speakers all. over the country. They point to the fact that the Government is doing nothing whatever to check the &quot; orgie of profiteer-ing,&quot; from which the conclusion is easily drawn that the Government and the House of Commons are working solely in the interests of the capitalists. It is probably not too much to say that the marked loss of confidence in Parliament is largely due to this fact, and until something is done to check profiteering, labour will remain in a discontented and rebellious mood.3. Wages. -Their present state of mind is, moreover, producing economic results which may have very grave consequences. The rise in the cost of domestic articles encourage legitimate claims for increased wages on the ground of cost of living, but in addition to this, as long as the workers know that their employers are making large profits, they are certain to claim some share in the spoils in the form of higher wages. In fact, fresh wage claims are being put forward every day of the week in almost all trades, and no end is at present in sight. The employers seldom or never put up any serious resistance, because they know that their profits are such as to enable them to pay, but not as to enable them to fight with, any prospect of public sympathy. Hence wages and prices continue to rise in a vicious circle, and unless some check is imposed, the cost of production in many industries will reach a point which will shut us out from foreign markets, when full corn-petition is resumed. The result would be a slump in our foreign exchanges, together with a stagnation of trade and drastic attempts to reduce wages, which would create a general situation which hardly bears contemplation.4. Output. Another effect of the suspicious frame of mind of Labour at the present time is to be seen in the decline of output. Some decline in the output per man was in any case inevitable. In the first place, the physiological and psychological reaction from the strain of the War is undoubtedly telling. Secondly, the reduction of hours was bound to reduce production. Neither of these causes, however, in themselves, need be regarded as very serious. The first is not likely to be more than transitory, and the second is largely counteracted by the similar movements for the reduction of hours in other countries. There is, however, a third cause, which will not be so easily discounted. It lies partly in the knowledge of the workers that excessive profits are being made out of their production, with the result that they are reluctant to work harder in order to give the capitalists a disproportionate return to what they will obtain themselves from their extra effort, and partly in the widespread belief that restriction of output provides more employment for others. It&apos; is needless to add that both these arguments are the subject of ceaseless propaganda by the extreme section. That there is very serious reduction in output is undoubted. The British bricklayer now lays about 200 bricks a day as against 300 before the Wax, and against 900 of the American bricklayers. The woodworkers are threatening a general strike in all woodworking trades unless payment by results is replaced by plain time work. This has already been done, on threat of a strike, by Messrs. Vickers, of Barrow, and the careful records, which they have kept, amply demonstrate the tremendous loss of output which has resulted. The same causes are at work in the coal mines and at the docks, and in a number of other industries. The need for greater production remains as great as it has ever been, but there is no hope whatever of obtaining it as long as Labour remains in its present frame of mind. In fact, the preaching of the gospel of higher pro-duction has probably had the reverse effect to what was intended. It is simply attributed by the workpeople to the desire of employers to swell profits, which are already abnormal, and therefore tends to induce further restrictions rather than greater effort.5. The Immediate Prospect-It is clear from the above that unless some drastic action is taken to alter the situation, a grave crisis must sooner or later occur.  The most difficult
period is likely to be between November and April next. If the prices of food, clothing and other articles continue to rise steadily during the winter, the exasperation that will be caused may produce very serious results, and it is quite certain that those who are interested in creating trouble will exploit the situation to the utmost. Any strike, and particularly one of a more or less general character, which affects every individual in the community, depends ultimately for its success on public opinion, that is to say, on the opinion of the great mass of&quot; consumers.&quot; A strike movement, which had the appearance of being a protest against profiteering and against excessive prices, would almost certainly be approved rather than condemned by the public. That means that its prospects of success, even to the point of upsetting the existing regime, would not be inconsiderable. A strike by the &quot; Triple Alliance &quot; against the community, and against the Government as its representative, for purely selfish ends, would almost certainly fail, but a strike which had the appearance of being directed against profiteering and against the Government as condoning it, might quite conceivably succeed.Remedies. The question of what should be done to remedy the present state of affairs admits of no easy answer.Broadly speaking, there appear to be two possible alternatives. On the one hand, it might be contended that the removal of the restriction of imports would restore foreign competition in the home market to an extent sufficient to reduce prices to something like a reasonable level. This expectation, however, must be qualified by several doubts. In the first place, it is doubtful whether it would be effective in time. Assuming that.all restrictions on articles of domestic use and consumption were removed in September, it seems questionable whether foreign competition would make itself felt in any considerable degree before the following Spring. It has to be remembered that America and, to some extent, Japan are the only manufacturing countries which are likely to compete seriously in the British market before next year, and it is quite possible that they will find the Central European markets more profitable until the acute shortage of almost all articles in the blockaded countries has been to some extent alleviated. In the second place, &apos;it may be found very difficult to remove the restriction on imports rapidly. Considerable pressure is certain to be put upon the Government by the manufacturers affected, and in some cases at any rate they may be supported by their workpeople. It is therefore very doubtful whether it is safe to rely on the removal of restrictions for the reduction of prices, and even if this were effected before the winter, it would still go but a short way towards removing the fundamental suspicions in the minds of the working classes.The second alternative is to resume some form of Government control. There has undoubtedly been a reaction in public opinion in favour of control since its removal has produced considerable rises in price. The decision to maintain the Food Ministry is, undoubtedly popular, and any measure which tended to restrain or reduce prices in other spheres would be equally welcome. On the other hand, if it is true that by giving confi-dence to Capital, Labour has been alienated, it is equally undesirable to attempt to regain the confidence of Labour by blighting the efforts of Capital. Much of the good work which has already been effected might be destroyed if the features of Government control which cripple enterprise and restrict the free movement of industry were restored. It is, however, worth consideration whether much could not be done by a simple fixation of maximum prices in a certain number of industries. The prices could well be fixed at a level which would give Capital a sufficient inducement to take the amount of risk which is inseparable from the present unsettled state of the world&apos;s markets. Representatives of the industries would be freely consulted, but it would probably be necessary to take power to inspect books in order to check the statements which were made as to profits. In the first instance those industries would be settled in which profiteering was known to exist, and the fixing of prices would be explicitly justified on this ground. The effect of this would be to have a moderating influence on other industries, which would probably show itself in the prices charged within a very short time. If it did not, the fixing of prices would have to be extended. But at present the Government is powerless, and the manu-facturers know it. The mere fact that the Government possessed the necessary powers would in itself modify the situation. Moreover, if prices were fixed, there would be some prospect of putting an end to the continual rises in wages. Unless this can be effected, our prospects when full international competition is resumed, in s*ay a year&apos;s time, are by no means bright.There is one further point to which attention may be drawn. Labour has now adopted, as a maxim, the principle that wages should bear some relation to profits. In trades like the iron and steel trade, wages are fixed on a sliding scale in relation to prices, and in the cotton trade, where the above principle has always been implicitly recognised, there have been very few serious wage disputes.   Until that principle is applied in other industries,(C 1830) A 2
there can be little hope of permanent industrial peace. It will be necessary, however, for the employers to submit to far greater publicity in regard to their financial position than they have hitherto been willing to accept. At present, Labour makes its claims for wages in ignorance of the probable effect oh industry because it has not the data on which to base a judgment, nor the knowledge with which to form one. As the organisation of Labour improves, this state of affairs becomes increasingly dangerous, and it is difficult to see any way of restraining excessive claims in well-organised industries, except by giving the men the true facts, and by associating them with the responsibility for maintaining the industry. This, however, is seeking a deeper solution, and one which must take time to effect; In the meanwhile, the present situation seems to call for some immediate steps to be taken, to prevent a really serious state of affairs arising during the coming winter.Part II. Demobilisation and Resettlement.The Resettlement of Disabled Men.In this report for the week ending the 28th May, 1919, attention was drawn to the difficulties experienced by the Department in the complete reabsorption into industry of disabled ex-Service men, and some account was given of the proposed scheme for their resettlement put forward by the Rotherham Employment Committee and endorsed by other Employment Councils and Committees. Since&apos; that date a modified form of the Rotherham scheme has been submitted to, and approved by, the Labour Resettlement Committee. The principle has also been accepted by a conference representative of a number of staple industries. In accordance with the recommendations of these bodies, the plan forms at the present time the subject of discussion with the National Trade Advisory Committees, Employment Councils and other bodies representative of organised labour and employers.The scheme is based on the assumption that some 80,000 to 100,000 men in receipt of disablement pensions will not be placeable in the normal course of industry by the Employment Exchanges. It is with this residue that the Ministry is especially concerned. It is proposed to appeal to all employers, except those employing less than 10 workers*, to take on as many disabled men as possible. The minimum suggested is 5 per cent, -of the total number of employees, except where special industrial considerations indicate that this proportion is not feasible. It is suggested that employers undertaking this obligation should be entitled to use a die on their correspondence paper, indicating the fact of their acceptance of the scheme, and that a register of all such firms should be kept by the Ministry of Labour. The undertaking Avould be binding for a year, and renewable at the end of that period. The Government would itself undertake to employ not less than 5 per cent, of disabled men, both departmentally and in its industrial establish-ments. Further, the House of Commons would be invited to insert a clause in all Govern-ment contracts, on the lines of the Fair Wages Clause, requiring Government contractors to employ an agreed percentage of disabled men. Local authorities would be asked to follow the Government^ lead in this matter. An element of compulsion would thus- be introduced.The disabled men, where they are not trainees under the Government Training Scheme, would be paid at the district rate, except where their disability reduces earning capacity. In that case, the Local Employment Committee would be asked to advise on the rate to be paid. The various National Trade Advisory Committees are now being asked whether they approve of the application of the scheme to their industry firm, by firm. They are asked to express their opinion as to the percentage of employees which each firm should be required to employ, and as to the basis on which the percentage should be calculated. While these negotiations are as yet far from complete, a summary of the results so far present a not unfavourable outlook.Sixteen National Trade Advisory Committees have considered the subject. The engineering and shipbuilding committee were not prepared on their own responsibility to &apos; recommend adoption of the scheme, hut decided that it must be referred to the constituent associations&apos; and unions. The remaining fifteen committees ail made definite recommen-dations on the matter. The principle was accepted in most cases ; differences have centred mainly round the question of compulsion1, the proportion-of disabled men to be absorbed, and the type of men fitted for the industry.Thcscheme was accepted; without qualification in the case of the musical instruments trade, and&apos;1 the-electricity, power and light industry.   The committee for the gold,, silver* The number originally proposed was 20.
and kindred trades also accepted the scheme in principle, fixing the proportion of disabled men to be absorbed at 5 per cent., taken on all employees, but advising the deletion of the clause referring to the use of a special die.The element of compulsion involved was strongly deprecated in the case of the tailor-ing trade. Subject to this exception, however, the committee expressed themselves as strongly in favour of the scheme, believing that the trade would absorb at least 5 per cent, calculated on the basis of the male staff alone.In the brush making industry the committee approved the scheme in principle, but were of opinion that it should apply to all firms irrespective of the numbers of employees, and that if the suggested clause were inserted in Government contracts, steps should he taken to extend its provisions to all employers of labour. In view of the large number of women employed in the trade, the percentage for absorption should be reduced to 3 per cent.In the distributive trades,&apos;the committee approved the scheme in principle. Reser-vations were made, however, by certain members who were unable to agree to the clause involving compulsory&apos; acceptance in the case of Government contracts, while others considered that it would be necessary to apply the scheme to the smaller firms if full advantage is to be taken of all possible openings for disabled men.The committee for the furniture trade agreed, after considerable discussion, that there were few, if any, openings for unskilled or semi-skilled men, but that a considerable number could probably be absorbed after training. The committee would not agree to fix on any&apos; percentage for absorption. In this industry, therefore, the future of the scheme, depends on the rapid progress of training schemes.The position as regards the basket making industry is similar, the Trade Advisory Committee agreeing that there were no openings for unskilled or semi-skilled men, and that it was necessary, therefore, to consider the scheme from the point of view of absorbing the required percentage of disabled men as trainees. Stress was laid,, however, on the influence of foreign competition in the industry, and the committee would only commit itself to a statement that it was prepared to use every endeavour to train as soon as possible as many men in the trade as the industry could absorb.The committee for dental mechanics, again, pointed out the lack of openings for un-skilled labour, but agreed that as many trainees as could be absorbed should be accepted. The prospects in this direction, however, were held to depend upon an extension of the training period in order to produce greater efficiency. The committee for the printing-industry was of opinion that the requisite proportion of men should be reached on trainees alone and asked for fuller training facilities. That for the leather goods trade required that all men should be interviewed by the Local Technical Advisory Committee to ascer-tain their fitness for training in view of the fact that they wish ultimately to train all. disabled men entering the trade. The committee for the glass industry also accepted the principle of the scheme provided that Local Technical Advisory Committees were consulted as to the suitability of the men put forward.The committee for building agreed that the trade should endeavour to absorb 5 per cent, of disabled men provided that the suitability of unskilled men were the subject of adjudication by Local Technical Advisory Committees and that the wages paid to such workers should be assessed by the same bodies. It is perhaps worth mentioning that the representative on the committee of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners was hostile to the scheme. The committee for vehicle building approved of the scheme provided that the introduction of disabled men should not lead to discharges of men already in the trade, that in the event of a surplus of labour being found women should&apos; be discharged before men previously engaged in the trade, and that as many as possible of the disabled men entering the industries in a non-skilled capacity should be encouraged to undergo a course of training. This committee also was of opinion that the scheme should not be limited to firms employing more than 20 men, as originally proposed.The committee for hosiery held that 5 per cent, was too large a proportion for the industry in view of the great amount of female labour employed, but expressed their willing-ness to absorb 2 per cent, immediately. That for the hand-sewn boot making and repairing industry, while expressing sympathy with any scheme for the employment of disabled men, held that this particular branch of the trade had already taken its 5 per cent, quota, and that the manufacturing section was therefore the body to approach.(C 1830)B
Part III.-Press Comments. (1) Labour and Socialist Press. (A) Foreign Affairs.The Treaty of Peace.The signature of the Treaty of Peace at Versailles on 28th June is the event round which the discussions of the Peace in the papers reviewed this week revolve. The majority of the papers (&quot; Bob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; is a notable exception) regard the act of signature as the formal end of the war, and the Woolwich &quot; Pioneer,&quot; as a result, is troubled by the fact that the blockade is to continue until the Treaty has been ratified by Germany. The observations of the papers are in the main upon three topics ; they discuss the question whether the Treaty is really one of Peace, they discuss the meaning which is to be attached to the German signatures, and upon the Treaty as a text some of them base lessons in history and politics.(a) Is it Peace ? Under this title there are many leading articles which answer the question.in the negative sense. The &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, expresses the opinion that there is no assurance of peace in the signature of the Treaty, because the Treaty does not settle the problems which caused the war, and has, indeed, made them more intense. Mr. Philip Snowden adds, in the same paper, that the Treaty has created new problems likely to disturb future peace and leaves militarism rampant in the Allied countries. The Woolwich &quot; Pioneer &quot; thinks that the only value of the Treaty is that for the moment it does not produce war: the possibilities of permanent peace, it thinks, are as remote as they were before the war. The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; declares that this is a primitive peace of spoliation and quotes M. Camille Huysmans&apos; opinion that there can be no peace when Great Britain alone has the right to colonies, when the Germans in Austria have not the right to unite with Germany and when Russia is not to be allowed to. live her own life. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; puts emphasis upon the 23 wars still in existence and declares that there can be no end of the war until the blockade has been removed and until our soldiers return home. The &quot; Nation &quot; remarks that French policy is insuring itself four times over, by reducing Germany to military and economic impotence, by the new Alliance with America and England, by the League of Nations and by the creation of a belt of minor Allies round Germany to serve as so many barriers to her expansion. In these, latter creations of the Treaty and in the Balkan States the 41 Nation &quot; sees the menace to future peace. &quot; Some of the fiercest and least controllable and least educated races have been given a power of disturbance they never had before.&quot; The opinion of the &quot; British Citizen &quot; is that the German must take his gruelling like a man. The &quot; Clarion &quot; maintains-that we have no monopoly of wisdom and no right to dictate the terms of re-adjustment to our Allies.(b) The Validity of the Treaty. The &quot; Clarion &quot; refers to the report that Herr Miiller went to Paris on 1st August, 1914, to urge the French Socialists to oppose war credits and to assure them that the German Socialists were determined to vote against war credits in the Reichstag. The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that the conclusions which may be drawn from this, as regards the validity of Herr Miiller&apos;s signature to the Treaty, are too obvious to need stating. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; thinks that no weight or moral authority can be attached to the signatures of the German delegates. &quot;They, like General Smuts, have signed the Treaty to secure temporary relief, from the horrors of continued war.&quot; (It may be noted that Mr. Philip Snowden summarises in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; parts of General Smuts&apos; statement on the Peace Treaty and thus turns it into a complete and bitter denunciation-ciation of the Treaty, which, in fact, it was not.) In the opinion of the &quot; Nation &quot; the Treaty is incapable of being fulfilled because it is unendorsed by the only signature which could have honoured it, in that the peoples of Europe have had no share in its making. The &quot; British Citizen &quot; approves of General Smuts&apos; declaration that joint effort is essential for the reconstruction of a ruined and broken world and thinks that there need be on our part not the slightest hesitation in making things easier for Germany, provided that Germany heartily co-operates.(c) Political and Historical Lessons. To the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;the moral of the Treaty is that those supporters of the war who are now advocating a revision of the Treaty must surely now realise what could have been achieved three years ago, if they had given their support then to the small minority of men who advocated a peace of mutual understanding and reconciliation. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the same paper, draws the conclusion that the statesmen of the old order have failed and betrayed us, and that the democracies must now take up the work. The&apos;&apos; Yorkshire Factory Times&apos;&apos; thinks that so long as we have conscrip-tion and armament firms, so long shall we have war.  The lesson of the &quot; Nation &quot; is that
(save for the unfree part of our own Commonwealth) the name of Empire has disappeared from the earth and that the cult of Imperialism has&apos; also ceased to be.Russia.Mr. F. W. Jowett urged, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; of 28th June, that the I.L.P. must make the Russian question the centre point of its propaganda^ This week the &quot; New Age &quot; expresses the opinion that the wisdom of this policy is unchallengeable. The Russian Revolution, says this paper, is important because it is the &quot; only visible symbol of a possible opposition to the impending regime of international Trusts.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; publishes the fourth and final instalment of Miss Sylvia Pankhursfs inter-yiew with a Russian-who left Moscow on 20th May.f It may be noted that this Bolshevist is hostile to co-operation. J He says that the Co-operative Societies were at first encouraged by the Soviet Government as a means of breaking down the system of private trading ; but because the societies in some cases tend to be counter-revolutionary (because the bourgeoisie may capture them) and because their structure is not fully communistic, the Soviets no longer encourage them and they will gradually disappear. This Russian is also of the opinion that&quot; the Revolution &quot; will come in Italy and France soon and without difficulty. In America and England it may show itself to be even more terrible than in Germany, Where it has been violent because large sections of the workers have fought against it. Mr. V. Isaiev, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; concludes his analysis of Russian Socialist Parties, the main point of which is that the Bolsheviks are entirely arbitrary in claiming to be the only defenders of the working classes. On the contrary, he says, the Bolsheviks severely prosecute all socialist parties, which proves that they aim not so much at serving -the interests of labour as at holding power in their own personal interests.Other.Mr. Philip Snow den, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses the opinion that the American Federation of Labour is still the most reactionary labour organisation in the world; but he do as not think that the Convention of this body is any more representative of the mass of American Trade Unionists, than is the Trade Union Congress in England.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; rejoices that Mr. Gompers has been re-elected President of the A.F.L.  This re-election, thinks the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; means that the Federation is determined to make a strong stand against the Bolshevist tendencies of the extremist sections of American Labour.  The &quot; New Statesman&quot; contains an article on &quot; International Co-operative Trade.&quot;  It regards the enterprise of the English C.W.S. in arriving at a direct trading arrangement with the Russian Co-operative Societies in the Rostov district as an experi-ment with immense possibilities.?   Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses his satisfaction with the fact that the Labour Party is no longer hostile to the direct representation of the I.L.P. on the International.   He thinks that it is the Inter-national instinct of the I.L.P., its political prevision (shown in its attitude to the war) and freedom from mechanical dogmas which, in spite of its lack of linguistic attainments and of sound Marxian faith, have won it the respect which, he says, it now holds all over Europe.  He outlines the attitude the I.L.P. and the International must adopt towards continental revolutions.   &quot; Instead of helping to separate nations into different groups, in accordance with the nature of the revolutions through which they go, they must strive to combine them in one revolution of many phases.&quot;   The I.L.P., in his opinion, can be of great Value in the pursuit of this policy because it has, he says, the coiifidence of all sections of importance, which it has gained and must keep by being &quot; All things to all men.&quot;(B) Home Affairs.Direct Action.The resolution passed at the Labour Party Conference, by which the Executive of. the party was instructed to consult with the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. with a view to the taking of ce direct action &quot; on the question of intervention in Russia, is the subject of much discussion. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; expresses the opinion that the resolution was less a general approval of the use of industrial action to attain political objects than an intense disapproval of the Allies foreign policy. If the abstract question of &quot; direct action&quot; had been under discussion he does not think the vote would have been so decisive. On the abstract question, he says that the full-power of labour can be utilised only by a combination of industrial and political action. On the specific proposal, he thinks that &quot; when a Government abuses its trust and departs on a new policy which has not the support of the country, it is within the legitimate rights,* See Report, 2nd July, p. 6. % Cf. ibid., p. 5.f Cf. Report, 18th June, p. 5. $ Cf. Report, 25th June, p. 12.(C 1830) &apos; B2
even of a minority, of the people to assert its disapproval by any means in its power.&quot; Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; similarly insists that this belief of Labour that &quot; the present Parliament has been elected on fraudulent issues,&quot; makes the case of Russia a very special one.   He is less confident than Mr. Philip Snowden, and argues that a strike on a political issue, and a general stoppage of industry, could never occur except when the Government did not represent the people ; and this conclusion seems to him to be a complete answer to the argument that the &quot; direct action &quot; policy would be an attempt on the part, of a minority to enforce its will on the whole of the people.   In any case of doubt he suggests a General Election would settle the matter.  He insists that the passing of the resolution does not -mean an abandonment of political action, and . expresses the opinion that industrial action does not mean the use of force, but is essentially passive resistance.   The &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen &quot; points out that the resolution is not one to take &quot; direct action,&quot; but one in favour of &quot; direct action.&quot;   It thinks that there are other matters, besides intervention in Russia, upon which it would be justifiable to take &quot; direct action.&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; defends &quot; direct action &quot; as a means of correcting political crimes, but against majorities fairly gained he thinks that argument alone must be used.   He maintains that constitutional arguments are irrelevant to the discussion; the only question is, &quot; Is the political strike practicable, and will it be effective ? &quot;  In nine cases out of ten he thinks it would fail, but its chance of success on the Russian and Conscription issues he thinks to be unusually great.   In any case he insists that it must be a strike limited in time ; if such strikes be prolonged, they may overreach themselves and become revolution, and not necessarily successful revolution.  The &quot; Railway Review &quot; publishes an answer by Mr. T. Craik to Mr. Clynes&apos; recent article in the &quot; Observer &quot; on &quot; direct action.&quot;   It may be noted that one of Mr. CraiFs main arguments is that Mr. Clynes &quot; conveniently kept away from such embarrassing matters as Russia and Conscription.&quot;   In its leading article this paper addresses the &apos;* hot-heads &quot; who are dissatisfied with the progress towards fighting, and says that the issues are too great for other than action which is carefully prepared.   It does not think that any action will be taken before the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress. This paper confesses that it does not think it a groundless complaint, that one heard too much of the Triple Alliance and that whatever trouble arose &quot; minor persons considered it within the sphere of their duty oratorically to threaten the Government with the power of the Triple Alliance.&quot;   &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; confesses that though lie has no illusions about Bolshevism, he is in favour of bringing every legitimate means of action to bear upon the Government to withdraw our troops from Russia.   But he does not think that a political strike would be a legitimate means of action.   He fears that a serious cleavage may result in the party in consequence of the resolution.   The opinion of the &quot; New Age &quot; is that the Russian question has far too many, political associations to give a clear industrial issue, and in view of the opinion of this paper that the strike would involve a split in the Labour movement and, in any case, would be purely negative in character, it thinks a political strike on the Russian issue would be inexpedient.   This opinion that a strike of this type would split the Labour movement is also shared by the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; which insists that the objects of a political strike must command over-whelming support not only inside the unions directly concerned but amongst the general population.  If the present Government were to repeal the Trades Disputes Act it thinks that the conditions necessary for the successful operation of a general political strike would be fulfilled ; but it rather doubts whether they are fulfilled in the present instance. In the abstract, it is not prepared to rule out &quot; direct action &quot; as a method which no circumstances could ever justify, pending the creation of a more effective democratic machine than the present.   The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; criticises the resolution as being vague.   It is disappointed that it was so carefully kept apart from the proposed demonstrations on the 20th and 21st July, and declares that nothing more will be heard of the resolution unless the rank and file force the hands of their Executives.   &quot; The Call&quot; is pleased with the resolution, though it does not pretend that it goes as far as could be desired ; the passing of the resolution is regarded by this paper as a sign of the influence the B.S.P. has over the rank and file of the Labour movement.   The &quot; Demo-crat&quot; and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; both unreservedly condemn &quot; direct action.&quot;Parliamentary Labour Party.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; expresses his pleasure with the dis-cussion at the Labour Party Conference as to the work of the Parliamentary Labour Party. He describes Mr. Adamson&apos;s speech as a &quot; laboured and ineffective address.&quot; Under his leadership he thinks the Parliamentary Party can never give satisfaction.Labour Party Conference.In addition to the voluminous discussion on &quot; direct action &quot; there are many general judgments of the conference.  Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks that
the most remarkable thing about the conference was the change shown in the opinion of the delegates, as expressed by the resolutions on the Peace Treaty and cognate subjects.. He compares these resolutions with the decisions of the Bristol Conference, held 18 months after the outbreak of the war. In a leading article, this paper remarks &quot; how different the present state of Europe might have been if the Labour Party had from the beginning taken the international view which now dominates its policy.&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot;Forward,&quot; expresses the opinion that the conference needed a more experienced chairman, and suggests that on the next occasion the conference must sit for an additional day. Mr. T. Kennedy, in &quot;Justice,&quot; thinks that the conference, as a vehicle for the-expression of Labour policy, was a failure. Mr. Kennedy is of the opinion that the com-bination between the I.L.P. and the direct actionists will not last long. In a leading article, in this paper, these opinions are endorsed. &quot; If the trade unionists wish to take a lead in a serious social and political revolution for the benefit of the whole people, they must take far more interest than they do at present in the work of the Labour Party, and not leave the task to men who are not trade unionists and who are mainly concerned about the Labour Party as a sounding board for their views.&quot; The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; thinks that the conference was a great triumph for the pacifist reformism of the I.L.P., but complains about the reception of the foreign delegates. &quot;The Call&quot; complains of the &quot;bias and incompetence&quot; of the chairman and of the way in which the platform monopolised the debates.Coal Industry Commission.Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks that there is abundant evidence that we are faced with a terrific contest between organised capital and national interests. He asserts that nationalisation of the coal mines cannot be carried without the support of the Labour Party. The Merthyr &quot;Pioneer&quot; expresses the opinion that &quot;the knell of capitalism has been rung and the report of the Coal Commission was its epitaph.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman&apos;&apos; this week definitely expresses the opinion that the Government is just as much pledged to adopt Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s second report as it was to adopt his first.* On Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s opinion of the peculiar and exceptional importance of the coal industry,^ the &quot; Clarion,&quot; after remarking that man does not live by coal alone, bases an argument for the national control of food, clothing and housing. The &quot;New Age&quot; fears that the miners&apos; leaders, after a formal resistance, are prepared to accept Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report as it stands, and warns them not to do so.Other.Mr. F. W. Jowett, in the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; and Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; favourably mention Mr. Kellaway&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on the 24th June on the work of the Ministry of Munitions. Mr. W. A. Appleton, in the &quot;Democrat.&quot; deals again with the vital importance of our export trade and the folly of any &quot; experimental revolution.&quot; The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; contains an article on &quot; Whitley Councils &quot; in which the opinion is expressed that the present state of organi-sation of Joint Industrial Councils is a disgrace to the employers and trade union leaders. On the other hand, the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; is somewhat pleased with the way in which South Wales tinplate workers have repudiated the recent decisions of the trade Industrial Council, and &quot; The Call&quot; refers to Whitley Councils as a &quot; device for fastening the shackles of wagedom still more firmly round the necks of the workers.&quot;(2) The Press on Demobilisation and.Resettlement.Unemployment Donation.The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (3rd inst.) reports that the National Union of Ex-Service Men had adopted a resolution condemning the action of the Government in reducing the rate of the unemployment donation after the first 26 weeks.&apos; The &quot; Democrat&quot; (4th inst.) maintains that the payment of&quot; semi-permanent unemployment doles is having a dangerous mental effect on the less perfectly educated people of the country.&quot; These people, suggests this journal, are coming to have an exaggerated and false idea of the Governments and the oountry&apos;s resources. &quot; The Government are laying up ruin for the country and ignominy for themselves.&quot;Building Trades.Mr. W. Bradshaw has been interviewed by a special correspondent of the &quot; Times,&quot; and this paper gave an account of the interview on the 4th inst. Mr. Bradshaw made it clear that the trade unions put together the Governments alleged exaggeration of the* Cf. Keport, 2nd July, p. 7.t Cf. Mr. Justice 8ankey&apos;s Report, $XXII (dud. 210, p. 10).(d 1830) C
amount of labour required in house-building, the retention of skilled building trades employees in the army, the failure to ratify agreements, and the demand for the abrogation of trade union customs in order to expand the amount of labour available, and in these four things are disposed to discover a deep scheme to undermine their industrial position. From a statement in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; (8th inst.) it appears that the National Council of the Amalgamated Society of Joiners and Carpenters thinks that thereare sufficient building trades operatives still in the army to satisfy what demand for additional labour there is, in view of the shortage of supplies and the limited number of authorities prepared to commence building operations.Trade Unions and the Ex-Soldier.The &quot; Daily News &quot; (4th inst.) contained a letter from Mr. Fred Bramley, Assistant Secretary of the Trade &quot;Union Congress Parliamentary Committee, in which he said that he agreed with Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s protest against the attitude the trade unions were adopting towards the ex-soldiers. But he thought that there was need for a little more investi-gation, and said that he knew of serious attempts to exploit disabled men on the part of employers who were seeking to use the pension as a means of securing cheap labour. He suggested a conference to discuss the matter ; a conference in his opinion would avoid the disaster of allowing a feeling of hostility to grow up between ex-Service men and trade unionists. The &quot; Morning Post &quot; (5th inst.) dealt with the matter in a leading article, and attacking the trade unions warned them: &quot;If the trade unions have alienated the ex-Service men they will have to deal with a united body little less powerful than them-selves, much better guided, and commanding the sympathy of the whole country outside the trade unions.&quot; Mr. G. N. Barnes is quoted in the &quot; Morning Post &quot; (8th inst.) as saying that he heartily approves of Sir Robert Horne&apos;s scheme for placing a certain proportion of disabled men in all big works at full wages. He hoped that a larger view of their duty might prevail over the sectional interests which were putting obstacles in. the way. . The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; (3rd inst.) remarks upon the matter, and dwells upon the services the trade unions rendered to the soldiers during the war in abandoning many of their customs in the nation&apos;s interests (which customs have not yet been restored); Sir Douglas Haig is assured that trade unions are with the soldiers, and are not going to allow any employer to use them at blackleg prices.Part IV. General Topics and District Reports.(1) General.National Industrial Conference.The amendments to the Minimum Wage and 48-hour Bills, which were submitted to the Minister by the Joint Sub-Committee of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference and accepted with certain modifications by him at his meeting with it on the 16th June, have been incorporated in the Bills. Drafts of the revised Bills have been sent to each side of the Joint Committee, and a meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee, to be held on Friday, the 11th July, will have the Bills before it for its joint consideration.Housing.A Conference of Building Trade Operatives, consisting chiefly of the Operatives&apos; side of the Resettlement Committee of the Joint Industrial Council for the Building Trade, was held at Montagu House on the 8th July. The Minister presided, and Dr. Addison, Sir David Shackleton, Mr. G. J. Wardle and Sir James Carmichael were also present. The object of the meeting was to confer with the Operatives&apos; representatives with regard to the national need of housing, and the steps to be taken to augment the supply of labour in the building trades. The Operatives&apos; representatives expressed their full sympathy with the efforts being made to speed up housing schemes, and intimated their willingness to help. But they were in agreement that &quot; dilution&quot; in the war-sense was impossible in the building trade, though they stated that &quot;augmentation&quot; of labour might in certain circumstances be possible. They were inclined to doubt Dr. Addison&apos;s fear that there was or would be a real shortage of labour in the building trade, and pressed for the full utilisation of all the labour that was or might become available. Mr. T. Otley, National Association of Operative Plasterers, and others emphasised the fact that very large numbers of building trade operatives were still in the army, and strongly advocated their release, while Mr. J. Armour, United Operative Masons&apos; Association of
-Scotland, suggested that thousands of building operatives had, during the war, gone into other trades, such as munition works, shipbuilding and engineering, timber-felling and so on, and would probably return to building as soon as work on a large scale definitely began again. Other representatives, notably Mr. Bradshaw, National Federation of Building Trades and Operative Stonemasons&apos; Society, stated that they could not expect their Unions to follow them unless they had some definite agreement with the Government securing them against the fear of unemployment after the boom. Dr. Addison stated that the Minister -of Labour and he had written a joint letter to the Army Council requesting the release of building trade operatives, and that enough work was in hand and in prospect to last for several years, so there was no fear of unemployment. In conclusion, Mr. R. Wilson, Amalgamated Society of Slaters and Tilers, speaking on behalf of the operatives as a whole, stated that the operatives wished to discuss the situation among themselves, with reference to (1) the existing and prospective demand for labour, and (2) the extent to which this demand might be supplied by the release of men from the army, by the return of men who had gone temporarily into other industries, by the possible extension of overtime and better utilisation of existing labour, and by taking steps to stimulate production.Nationalisation.At the quarterly meeting of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce held at the Connaught Rooms on the 2nd July, Mr. E. Manville Fenn, M.P., announced that Mr. Bonar Law was to receive a deputation from the Council of that body, before any action would be taken by the Government on the Coal Commission Report. Mr. Hobson, the Vice-President of the Association, moved a resolution in favour of State acquisition of-coal (royalties and wayleaves) with just compensation, but not in favour of the State undertaking the ownership or management of coal mines, and committing the meeting to the opinion that State ownership or management of coal mines would lead to dearer coal for domestic consumption, dangerously dearer coal for industry, and to a disastrous limitation of coal for export. Further resolutions against Nationalisation of coal mines reported during the week include Wolverhampton Chamber of Commerce, Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Nottingham Chamber of Commerce, Midland Iron Masters, and North of England Steamship Owners&apos; Association. It is reported that the Labour Party is determined to resist dilatory tactics on the part, of the Government with regard to the question of Nationalisation of Mines. It is also stated that the pending by-elections in. Swansea, Durham and Lanarkshire are to be fought by the miners&apos; leaders on the same question. A conference convened by the Midland District Council of the N.U.R., and attended by delegates from branches of the N.U.R., the R.C.A., and the A.S.L.E.F., held at Leicester on the 5th inst., advocated the State purchase of railways.Royal Commission On Agriculture.The terms of reference to the Royal Commission on Agriculture are as follows :-; To enquire into the economic prospects of the Agricultural Industry in Great Britain with -special reference to the adjustment of a balance between the prices of agricultural com-: modities, the costs of production, the remuneration of labour and the hours of employment.. The Chairman of the Commission is Sir W. Peat, F.C.A., ex-president of the Institute of) Chartered Accountants, and the Commission will consist in all of 23 members, including: Sir W. J. Ashley, Mr. H. S. Cautley, K.C., M.P., Mr. F. E, Green, Mr. J. M. Henderson and Mr. R. V. Lennard. Eight agriculturists and eight labour representatives are included. It is reported by the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; that a wider scope for the Commission has already been demanded by the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union, the Workers&apos; Union, and the Scottish Farm Servants, in order to enable the Commission to enquire into nationalisation.Textile Worlcers.The strike in the Cotton Trade is now settled. It was reported that 90 per cent, of the mills were idle and over 300,000 cotton operatives were out.. Some disturbances and riots are stated to have taken place at Ashton-under-Lyne, Staleybridge, Dukinfield and elsewhere. The spinners insisted that in future negotiations with the employers should be conducted not by the Legislative Council of the United Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association as heretofore but by the Joint Executives of all the nine constituent trade unions of the Association. The effect of this new arrangement is to give the spinners a much larger voice in the final decision. A meeting of the executives of all the unions was held at Manchester on the 7th July and was visited by the Management Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions. At the close it was announced that the following resolution had been passed : &quot; That this meeting of executives of the trade societies affiliated to the Textile Factory Workers&apos; Association approach the. employers for a further meeting with a view to getting the hours reduced and the time clause reduced ; and further we pledge ourselves to do the utmost in our power to bring the result arrived at to a successful issue.&quot;
The employers agreed, &quot;as a matter of courtesy,&quot; to meet the operatives&apos; repre-sentatives, and at this conference, held on the 9th July, a settlement was reached.   It was unanimously agreed to recommend for acceptance by all the various organisations :  (1) The 48-hour working week ; (2) an advance of 30 per cent, on the standard piece price&apos; list rates of wages ; (3) an equivalent alteration in rates of pay in the case of those work-people whose wages are not covered by a standard piece price list; (4) the 48-hour working week to remain in operation without change for a period of eighteen months from the date of this coming into operation, and after the expiration of that period one months notice to be given by either side of any desired alteration ; (5) the altered rates of pay to-come into operation Avhen work is resumed, and to remain in operation without change until the 30th April, 1920, either side desiring an alteration in such rates of. pay to give one month&apos;s notice, but such one month&apos;s notice shall not be. given at an earlier date than the 31st March, 1920.   It is strongly recommended that the mills be reopened for work on Monday morning next, the 14th July.   Thus the only alteration in the terms previously agreed on is that the agreement is to cover nine months instead of eighteen.Miners. .Great dissatisfaction is felt among miners at the recent circular issued by the Coal Controller which states that miners&apos; piece rates will be increased by 10 per cent, and that anj&apos;&apos; additional increase must come out of guaranteed profits. It is stated by the miners&apos; representatives that this will not bring the total earnings on the 7-hour day to the same level as they are on the 8-hour day. It is reported that South Wales miners are asking for 15 per cent, increase, and Yorkshire and Lincolnshire miners have already secured the addition of one-seventh to piece rates. A meeting took place on the 8th July between the Executive of the M.E.G.B., the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour,. Sir Auckland Geddes and the Coal Controller. The Governments final word was that miners and mine owners would be allowed to negotiate by districts for an increase of piece rates up to 12^ per cent. The miners warned the Government that if they hold to-their decision there will inevitably be strikes.General Federation of Trade Unions.The Annual Council Meeting of the General Federation of Trade Unions was opened in Scarborough on the 3rd July. Mr. T. Mallalieu, Vice-Chairman, referred critically to the Labour Party resolutions at Southport. He stated that while the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress would associate itself politically with the Labour Party it would be allied with the General Federation of Trade Unions for purposes of the Trade Union International. This is of some importance in view of the rivalry which has. to some extent existed in the past as to what body is to act in connection with the International Trade Union movement. Mr. E. Fimmer, Secretary of the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions, and Mr. H. Gosling, President of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federa-tion, spoke on International Trade Unionism. At the meeting on the 4th July, Mr. John Hill, Boilermakers&apos; Society, speaking with reference to the negotiations with the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, stated that there was an impression that the employers had met to determine on their policy, and were out for a fight. A resolution against conscription was carried. Mr. J. Cross was re-elected President, Mr. T. Mallalieu Vice-President, Colonel John Ward, M.P., Treasurer, and Mr. W. A. Appleton, Secretary.Other Conferences.A delegate meeting of the A.S.E. met at Manchester and among other matters decided&apos; against the admission of women into the society. It had under discussion a suggestion, of the Erith Shop Stewards^ to the effect that overtime shall be made inversely proportional to unemployment in the industry.An adjourned meeting between the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trade Union representatives to continue the discussion of working conditions arising out of the shorter working week was held at York on the 1st and 2nd July, but no decision was reached.The National Delegate Meeting of the Civil Service Union was held on the 4th and 5th July. Discussion took place on the application of the Whitley Report to the Civil Service. Proposals for minimum rates of pay were carried and a resolution for closer co-operation with the Labour Party was adopted. Sympathy was expressed with the National Union of Police and Prison Officers in its endeavours to secure official recognition.A delegate meeting of Steel Sheet and Tinplate Workers was held at Newport on the $th July, and it was decided to withdraw from the Joint Industrial Council, to ask the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation to make application to join the Triple Alliance, but to support the Workers&apos; Educational Association rather than the Central Labour College. The juxtaposition of the last two points is interesting.
A joint conference of building employers and operatives at Rochdale has passed a resolution asking the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives to endeavour to obtain an inquiry into the building trade on the same lines as the Coal Commission.Russia, &amp;c.In accordance with the decision at the Labour Party Conference at Southport, the Labour Party Executive is circularising Trade Councils, Local Labour Parties and Trade Unions, calling for demonstrations to be held on the 20th and 21st July, as a protest against the &quot; reactionary &quot; policy of the Government. The Executive Committee of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers arid Firemen is circularising its branches urging its members to support these demonstrations. The Leeds branch of the General Workers&apos; Union has passed a resolution calling on the Council of the Union to ask the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress to convene a special conference to discuss the withdrawal of British troops from Russia, the repeal of conscription, &amp;c. The London District Committee of the Dockers&apos; Union has decided to advise its members to abstain from working on ships bound for Russia, and to refuse to sell their labour power to the employer on the 20th and 21st July.Income Tax.A deputation from the Triple Industrial Alliance waited upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 4th July, to put before him a proposal for raising the Income Tax Exemption Limit to  250. The deputation was introduced by Mr. Smillie, and the speakers were Mr. Frank Hodges and Mr. .C. T. Cramp. It is reported that a large number of Belfast shipyard workers were placed under arrest on the 4th July for refusal to pay income tax, and several Mansfield miners have been summoned for the same reason.Amalgamation, &amp;c.By 3,492 votes to 423, the Scottish Shale Miners have agreed to amalgamate with the Scottish Mineworkers&apos; Union, on the understanding that they are to have separate repre-sentation in the new Union. Plymouth and Blyth members of the Boilermakers&apos; Society, Iron and Steel Shipbuilding Society, Ship Constructors and Shipwrights&apos; Association, and Associated Blacksmiths&apos; and Ironworkers&apos; Society are reported to be pledged to vote : for amalgamation of these bodies. The Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland have decided by a large majority to recognise membership cards of the Scottish Brassmoulders&apos; Union, who have also accepted a like arrangement.The One-Man Business Association established during the war, and reported to have attained a membership of 600,000, has been merged in the United Kingdom Business Men&apos;s Federation, which seeks to defend the small trader against the menace of the multiple shops, the co-operative system and the pressure of taxation.Unemployment Donation Statistics.The gradual increase and decrease of unemployment in the last six months is indicated roughly by the total number of unemployment donation policies remaining lodged for the United Kingdom at various dates. From December to March unemployment increased very rapidly. On the 13th December, the number of policies remaining lodged was 196,779, on the 17th January this number had grown to 519,606, on the 14th February to 804,642, on the 21st March to 1,003,326. Then for six weeks the figures remained almost stationary, increasing very slowly to a maximum of 1,093,400 oh the 2nd May. Since then they have steadily decreased, falling to 771,211 on the 30th May, and 606,125 on the 27th June.* It should, however, be remembered, in connection with the light that these figures throw on unemployment, that the conditions under which the donation may be drawn have been growing progressively more stringent.Court of Arbitration.During the week ended the 5th July, 1919, 36 cases were heard by the Court, 17 in London and 19 in Glasgow.The.principal cases heard in London were as follows: Heavy Chemical Industry. An application by the National Federation of General Workers and the Joint Committee of Salt and Chemical Trade Workers to the Chemical Employers&apos; Federation for all advances granted during the war to be consolidated as wages. A proposal was made by the employers for a reduction in the present war advances equal to the percentage reduction in the cost of living as between November, 1918, and July, 1919, as quoted in the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; at these dates.* It should be noted that the last two totals do not include short-time workers in receipt of donation Of these there were 90,558 on the 30th May and 74,301 on the 20th June.
Soap and Candle Trades.-An application by the National Federation of&apos; General&apos; Workers and the Joint Committee of Salt and Chemical Workers to the Soap and Candle Trades Federation for all advances granted during the war to be consolidated as wages,. and a further advance of 15s. a week and the establishment of a 44-hour working week. A counter proposal, was made by the employers similar to that in the case of the chemical industry stated above.The. principal cases heard in Glasgow were : -Building Trade, Scotland. An application by the Building Trade Operatives of Scotland to the Scottish Building Trade Employees for an advance in wages of 3d. an hour. A counter proposal was made by the employers for a reduction in wages corresponding to any decrease in the cost of living.Boilermakers, Clyde District. An application by the Boilermakers&apos; and Iron and Steel Shipbuilding Society to the North-West Engineering Trades Employers&apos; Associations for the extension of the award of the Committee on Production (No. 2542) to their members employed in the Clyde and West Of Scotland districts which gave an advance of 20 per cent, on pre-war piece-work prices to riveters and caulkers, 20 per cent, on net earnings to platers and 20 per cent, advance to lieu workers whose recognised &quot; lieu &quot; rates had not undergone any advance since the outbreak of war.Shipbuilding and Ship Repairing Trades. An application by the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, the United Machine Workers&apos; Association and the Amalgamated Tool-makers, Engineers and Machinists to the Clyde Shipbuilders&apos; Association for an advance of 10 per cent, to piece-work vertical machine drillers.Joint Industrial Councils.Government Industrial. Meetings of Joint Drafting Committees have been held in connection! with Industrial Councils for the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, Office of Works, ana1 Stationery Office.Wool (and Allied,) Textiles. A further meeting of the Apprenticeship Committee of the Council was held in Bradford on the 25th June for considering and completing a scheme for re-establishing in the industry men whose apprenticeship had been interrupted by war service. The Scheme was considered in the light of the concessions made by the Minister.wh.en he received a deputation from the Council on the 12th June. After successful negotiations an agreement was reached.Wire -Manufacturing. Music Trades. The first meetings of the Councils for these trades w^ere held at Montagu House on the 24th and 25th June respectively. Officers were elected and committees appointed.Waterworks Undertakings. At a meeting of the Executive Committee, held on 25th June at Leeds, a discussion took place with regard to the establishment of a minimum wage of 63s. per week for all male adults. It was agreed that a decision should be taken at a meeting on 31st July.Trade Boards.New Trade Boards. The Minister has established a Trade Board for the Boot and Shoe Repairing trade (Great Britain) and has signed the Regulations with respect to its Constitution and Proceedings. He has also signed the Regulations for the Corset Trade Board.Special Order.-The Minister has made a Special Order applying the Trade Boards Acts to the Jute trade.(2) District Reports.London and South-Eastern.UnemploymenL-The decrease in unemployment continues, and no substantial increase is expected in any direction.Resettlement. Transport difficulties contine to figure largely in the observations of employers and others interested in resettlement. Complaints are received of difficulty in obtaining transport of bricks, and of the poor quality now being manufactured. Road repairs and improvements of considerable extent are in progress in London. There is some evidence of a revival of private business enterprise in various parts of London.
South Midlands and Eastern.Unemployment. The decline in unemployment is less marked than in previous weeks, and there is an increase in the number of women unemployed, due largely to strikes in the Leicester area. Unemployment may result in Norwich from the closing down of aircraft works.Resettlement. The main factors retarding resettlement are lack of housing accommo-dation, and insufficient transport facilities. The Railway Executive are taking steps to relieve congestion in the Peterborough brickfields by providing more trucks.. South-Western.Unemployment. A general, though small, decrease in unemployment is reported.Resettlement.-1 The position taken up by local trade unions over the retention of semi-skilled and general labour is retarding resettlement in cabinet making at Barnstaple. The variety of district rates for general labourers is stated to be affecting employment. The china clay trade in the St. Austel. area is suffering from want of tonnage on the &apos; coasting route to Liverpool en route for the Potteries.General. Unrest is mainly experienced in the building trade, where strikes are in progress on questions of hours and wages. It is pointed out in some quarters that, while unions are calling for recognition of pre-war practices, they are not-recognising that there was also a pre-war practice on the part of employers in some cases not to recognise unions. .0n the whole, the labour situation is satisfactory.West Midlands.Unemployment. The number of unemployed continues to decrease, though there . are small increases in some centres, due in certain cases to the return of discharged . soldiers.Resettlement. In Greater Birmingham a certain amount of work is delayed pending negotiations, chiefly on piece-rates, between employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s associations. In the Potteries a shortage of coal and clay is reported, and complaints are still made as to the non-release of pivotal men.General.--Practical unanimity against co-operation with non-organised workers is expected on the part.of the societies in the engineering industry. In the matter of the advanced rates now payable to women, the position is becoming easier as each award of the Court of Arbitration is made. The clearer definition thus provided tends to diminish difficulties and dispose of disputes. Many employers are beginning to hold, as it was long ago expected that they eventually would, that women&apos;s wages have now attained such a level, that it is uneconomical to employ them, and the effect of any increase would be their dismissal, and the substitution of youthful male labour.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Unemployment. The reduction in unemployment is not so marked as in the three previous weeks. Unemployment is still serious in Bradford, Castleford, Derby, Ilkeston, Leeds, Nottingham and other districts.* Resettlement. Several large schemes are in hand which will provide employment for several thousand men and women. The National Ordnance Factory, Nottingham, is being converted into a locomotive and railway material works, and the National Projectile Factory, Templeborough, into a cutlery factory. A new typewriter factory at Nottingham is expected eventually to employ over 2,000 men and women.General. There is said to be a -possibility of some trouble in the Sheffield cutlery and edge tool trades, principally concerning old customs and practices which are survivals from the time when these trades were local domestic industries, and are not considered compatible with modern factory developments.North- Western.Unemployment. The improved condition of trade is again reflected by a fall of nearly 10,000 in the live register of the Exchanges. Small increases are reported from four areas, three of. these, however, are popular holiday resorts, and the increase is believed to be due to migration for holiday purposes. The number of unemployed in the engineering occupations has fallen substantially.
Resettlement.&quot;-Difficulties in railway transport are still complained of as one of the chief obstacles to resettlement. The paper industry is short of coal, and there is a lack of patternmakers and moulders in the engineering trades. Little progress has been made with schemes for public works.General. The outlook is somewhat stormv owing to the position in the cotton trade. [See Part IV.]The building industry is nearly at a standstill in Liverpool, and there is general unrest in the building trade throughout the division, owing to certain sections, of the men endeavouring to throw over their executive.The position is also serious at the Liverpool Docks and in the furnishing trade.Northern.Unemployment. A reduction is again reported in the number of unemployed, chiefly in building and construction, shipbuilding, engineering and. the iron and steel trades.. The women&apos;s live register has fallen considerably in the last month, largely through the. withdrawal of those whose claims for out-of-work donation have been refused.   Carlisle is the only centre where there is a demand for unskilled women.Resetilement-Tlie principal limiting factors reported are shortage of railway wagons, affecting largely the supply of road material, lack of skilled quarrymen in certain cases, and housing difficulties.General.--Opinion among union officials on the nationalisation of coal mines is divided, and the more level-headed officials do not appear to be very enthusiastic on the side of nationalisation. When enthusiasm is displayed it is rather in favour of the vaguer ideal: of nationalisation of industries generally than of the immediate project regarding the coal mines.In the Tees district the announcement that the Glasgow Tramway Department had ordered rails from America has aroused considerable interest. It is understood that the order was taken at a lower price and for earlier delivery than could be arranged in this country.Wales.Unemployment.-^J\&apos;h.eie is a slight reduction in the total number of unemployed workers. A temporary increase is reported, however, as regards women, but is due mainly to regis-tration for employment at the Eoyal Show at Cardiff. An increase may, however, be caused by strikes in the Merthyr and Ebbw Vale areas, which are likely to affect a large number of steel workers, and by the partial closing of the Mond Nickel Works in the Swansea area.Resettlement. The recovery of industry is seriously hampered by sectional strikes.. Shortage of railway wagons, lack of orders in the steel trades, and shortage of housing accommodation are also the subject of complaint. Local authorities appear to be slow to start public works, and. private building operations are retarded by uncertainty as to future prices.General.-The industrial situation is very far from settled. Miners are expected to press for a higher increase in piece-rates than the increase which has been recommended by the Coal Controller.  [See Part IV.]The movement for a minimum wage of  5 a week appears likely to become general. The craftsmen of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Steel Makers&apos; Association have not shown a disposition to resume work unless their demand for this minimum is conceded..Scotland.Unemployment. The figures of unemployed, except in a few areas, are decreasing steadily. At Inverness, the outlook is not good, owing largely to the depression of the fishing industry through lack of craft and equipment, and Wick is affected by the same difficulty. The position at Coatbridge and Hamilton is still serious, especially as regards women; there are no new industries to absorb those discharged from war work. Unemploy-ment among women is still serious in the Dumbarton, Clydebank and Falkirk areas. Among men, the general difficulty lies in the placing of the unskilled.Resettlement-Thtd primary need in all parts is that of housing. In Hamilton and Motherwell street-making is in progress, and actual building operations are likely to begin at an early date. In other centres road-making is in progress. Transport difficulties are the subject of complaint from Stornoway, Kilmarnock and Denny. Shortage of materials is reported from Perth, Paisley, and in the hosiery trade at Kilmarnock.

The Governments final word was that miners and mine-owners would be allowed to negotiate by districts for an increase of piece-rates up to a maximum of 12  per cent. The miners maintain that 14-3 per cent, is required to keep earnings up to the level under the old working week, and they have warned the Government that strikes will inevitably result if this decision is adhered to. The wages board of Lancashire and Cheshire has agreed to a 14-3 per cent, increase, and both owners and men are making representations
to the Controller that this should be sanctioned. Negotiations on the new piece-rates are also proceeding in the Scottish, Northumberland, Durham, and Warwickshire coal-fields.
