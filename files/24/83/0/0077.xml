From Viceroy, olh July 1919. (Received 11th, .12.5 p,m.)990 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Reference to last paragraph of my telegram of the 29th June, 954 S. Roos-Keppel asks us to make it clear he did not intend to express any opinion as to whether measures proposed would be acceptable to Afghans or not and that he did not mean to imply that operations against both Afridisand Mohmancls would be their inevitable consequence. He explains: &quot; Close of afridi and IVJohmand backdoor into Afghanistan would so weaken their position that they might possibly prove more amenable than before, but, in the event of their ever forcing war on us, we should find it easy task to subjugate them.&quot;This, however, does not alter our view that proposed measures might necessitate operations against both tribes.We are sending full papers by mail.
