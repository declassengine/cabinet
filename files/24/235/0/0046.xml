91V(THIS DOOTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC             majesty&apos;3 GOVERNMENT).COPY HO.SECRETCP.  446 ( 52)CABINET.INDIA        Appreciation of the Political Situation by theGovernment of India, dated 21st December 1932.        Circulated for the information of the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for India.
                                                    9-5 a confidential APPRECIATION OF THE POLITICALSITUATION IN INDIA, MED 2lst DECEMBER, 1952,ISSUED OK THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OP               STATS FOR INDIA,     In this, the last appreciation for the year 1932,there is, perhaps, reason for a note of optimism.   Ayear ago Congress threw out a challenge to the government by the renewal ox the civil disobedience movement;  theissue was uncertain, but the firm and consistent policyfollowed by the Government throughout the year  has worndown the movement and, though Congress still attempts to revive enthusiasm among its supporters by publishing a programme of further activities, it appears to be incapable of staging a serious revival.   This positionrests on the steadily growing belief that Governmentwill maintain their existing policy.     Even more satisfactory than the success of the measures taken by Government is the fact that their policy  has been endorsed by the Legislatures, for Bills introduced in theCentral Legislature and in the Provincial Councils of thoseProvinces where civil disobedience movement was most  intensethe North V7est Frontier Province, Punjab, United Provinces,Bengal and Bombay, have all been passed by substant ial majority and without serious opposition - a result which the mostoptimistic would not have anticipated five months  ago.   The Bills, which are a guarantee against any serious  revival of the movement, have been subjected to much criticism in thenational press, which in this and in other matters, hasshown that it does not truly reflect public opinion and has lost some of its power to influence it.   The India League                                             delegatIon/
                                                        2 Iffdelegation,  to which a reference  was made  in  the  appreciationfor October, have  stated categorically that  India is  a hundred per  cent Congress,  but the decisions  of the council&apos;s show that their coercive and tyrannical methodshave alienated a great deal of sympathy.   There is  alsoa growing recognition of the dangers of direct action andcontempt for the law at a time when power is about to be handed over to untried popular Governments.    Congresshave not however openly given up the fight; to  do so wouldinvolve a still greater loss of prestige, but it is  probablethat, if the new constitution appears reasonably satisfactory to nationalist opinion, many of them will devote themselvesmore and more to endeavouring to secure power under  it.Some hope for a revival of power by securing support forthe settlement effected at ixllahabad at the Unity Conference.But as yet  there are no signs that the views expressed lastmonth will  prove incorrect, or that the settlement will prove acceptable to Mohammedans, or even to the othercommunities.     On another front Congress are experiencing a growingopposition.   Mr. Gandhi is carrying  on a campaign for theremoval of  untouchabiiity with vigour but hardly with hisformer ability;  he still keeps his weapon of a  &quot;fast untodeath&quot; in reserve and used it on one  occasion during thelast month  in an attempt to coerce the Government to yieldto his demand that a high caste convict should be allowedto do scavenging work for which he had volunteered.Government  refused to accede to his specific demand,  but expressed their readiness to see to what extent volunteerscould be allowed to do this work and on this, his fast wasstayed.   January 2nd has,  however, been fixed by him asday for a renewal of his fast on the question of the entry                                               of/
of untouchables  into temples but  his statements  issued from day to day give him plenty of loopholes to renounce the fast.   Notices of Bills to secure removal of the legalobstacles to temple entry have been given both in theAssembly and in the Had re. s Council and an attempt may oemade to rash them through on the present wave of  sentimentresulting from Mr. Gandhi&apos;s activities.     In the last appreciation, the question whether the ottawa agreement would be accepted by the IndianLegislature v;as uncertain;  their attitude proved to be largely based on lack of knowledge, and the agreement,having been explained in detail to a committee appointedby the Legislative Assembly, now has been accepted, andthe necessary legislation to give effect to  it has been passed.   As in the  case of the Ordinance Bill, theagreement has been criticised  in the press,  but  satisfactory results show that  the Indian Legislature has  judged theagreement  on its merits, and has not been misled by so-called political considerations and has endorsed thepolicy  of the Government.     In Burma, discussions  in  the newly elected Council  onthe  question of separation  are still proceeding  and theissue is still in  doubt.    The discussions  are rendereddifficult   by  the  fact that many are in favour of  joining the  Indian  federation only  on  the condition  that they cansubsequently secede  from it.    In regard to  the  electionitself it  is report  that the  overwhelming poll againstseparation  has  been  cast under direct  influence, in somecases amounting to religious compulsion,  of  Pongyis.Propaganda  of the most unscrupulous description was usedthroughout  the country, propaganda being designed  tofrighten Pongyis and induce  them to  influence the  electorate.                                              This/
991(j  AThis propaganda is said to have been financed by Indianmoney and to have been organised by the more extremepoiitical Pongyis in touch with certain Indians.The results show how easily an illiterate electoratecan be cajoled or intimidated by interested persons.
