THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No..    9CP.  401 (32).CABINET.MEAT  POLICY.       MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.    1.  I AM reporting, for the information of my colleagues, the action whichhas been taken since the Cabinet discussed the question  of meat policy on the2nd November.    2.  The  Cabinet  on the 2nd November (Cabinet 58  (32), Conclusion 6)decided     (c) That the question was one of great urgency and must be settled  as soon          as possible.    (b) That it should be remitted to a Conference of Ministers presided  over by          the Prime Minister.    3.  The  Conference of Ministers met  on the  same  day and decided,inter alia     (a) That the Secretary of State for Dominion  Affairs, the President of the          Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should          be authorised to confer as soon as possible with representatives of the          Dominion Governments and the Dominion Meat Interests, and also          with the Argentine Ambassador and representatives of the Argentine          Meat Interests.    (&amp;) That at these meetings the critical present and prospective position of          the United Kingdom meat market should be carefully explained, that          the views of the interests concerned should be ascertained in regard to          a voluntary scheme for restricting imports, but that no mention should          be made of any  possibility of the Government taking further power          to impose restrictions.    (c) To invite the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to consider what          contribution the home producers of meat could best make in order to          ensure equality of sacrifice in a voluntary restriction scheme.    4.  Discussions with representatives of Australia and New  Zealand, and ofthe South American meat  importers  followed,  and substantial  agreement wasreached on the 7th November, in time for an announcement the same night, inthe course of the debate in the House of Commons of the Governments intentionto bring into operation  forthwith  a  voluntary scheme  for the restriction ofimports of meat into the United Kingdom.    5.  Discussions on the  basis to  be adopted in regard to bacon imports thentook place with representatives of bacon exporting  countries.  These discussions were  concluded on  Friday, the 11th November,  and  communications  wereaddressed to the respective Governments through the Foreign Office.  Denmark,who supplies  over  60 per  cent, of  the  imports,  has   already indicated  herwillingness to co-operate on  the lines proposed.    6.  The co-operation of the Canadian Government  has also been invited.It will be remembered that the  Ottawa Agreement with  Canada provides for a quota up to 2,500,000 cwt. of bacon per annum for that Dominion.       [7874]
    7.  The position is therefore as follows :     Mutton and Lamb.        The Australian and New Zealand  Governments  have undertaken  to    restrict shipments  during November and December to an amount 10 per cent.    less than the amount shipped during the corresponding months of last year.        South  American importers have undertaken to reduce supplies for the    -same period by 20 per cent, of the November-December 1931 figures.    Chilled Beef.        South   American   importers  have  undertaken   to   reduce  supplies    immediately by 10 per cent, of last years figures and by further cuts up to    20 per cent, if in the  next  two or three weeks  sale prices do  not respond    adequately.  This arrangement  also  operates  for the  calendar months    November and December 1932.    Bacon.        Representatives of  foreign countries  exporting bacon to  the United    Kingdom  market  have agreed to  recommend  to  their  Governments  that    exports  during  the  two  months the  23rd  November,  1932,  to  the    22nd  January, 1933, should be limited  to amounts which have  been the    subject of  individual negotiation.  These  provisional  amounts are set out    in Appendix I.  The  net effect is that  during the period of  two months    beginning the 23rd November the total bacon supplies from foreign countries    would  be reduced  by 15-3 per cent.  This percentage is calculated  on the    average exports for the three months November-December 1931 and January    1932.    8.  The announcement of the Government decision itself had an immediatesteadying effect on the  markets both for home and imported meat, and a generalrise  in  wholesale  prices has taken place.   An  appreciation of the positionfollows, in pursuance of my promise (Cabinet  61 (32). Conclusion 12) to circulate a weekly note.  Typical figures for Smithfield market are given in Appendix II.The overall rise in the  price of imported meat has been around  15 per cent., andthe increase in the price of home-killed meat for example,  8^ per  cent, for english long sides though smaller  is  yet substantial.   This  rise  has in  turnbeen reflected in the prices  of fat cattle, which in a number of  representativemarkets have advanced by about  1 per head, or about 8  per cent.  Values ofstore  cattle  show little variation. Although the regulation  of bacon  and hamimports does not begin until the 22nd  November, there  has  already been  ananticipatory rise in the bacon market, for example, a  rise of 18  per cent, inDanish bacon.  There  are no precise data to  indicate the course of  retail pricessince  the  7th  November;  so far as  can be  ascertained, there  has been  no-appreciable change.  Landings of Irish fat cattle were 6,617 in the week ended the 12th November  compared with 6.623 in the corresponding week  of last  year.    9.  The situation  will need  to be closely  and continuously watched, and theMinisters  concerned have agreed that  this can best be done by an  AdvisoryCommittee composed of trade representatives under an independent Chairman.Steps are  being taken  to set up such a Committee forthwith.    An undertaking has been given to the representative Governments of bacon-exporting countries that further consultation with them will take place  duringthe operation of the scheme.    10.  The immediate questions have therefore been dealt with.  The following subjects, which relate  mainly to long-term policy, are still  outstanding : (i) The Lane-Fox Report.    The Cabinet decided (Cabinet 55 (32), Conclusion 8) :          (a) That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should be authorised               to   prepare  a Bill,  for Inter-Departmental use  in  the first               instance, for the purpose of  setting forth with  precision his               proposals.  This authority was given entirely without  prejudice               to the final decision of the Cabinet on the subject.
                                     3        (b) To take note that the subject was under consideration between the               Departments concerned.        The preparation of a draft Bill is in hand.  Agreement between the        Departments  concerned  has  been  reached on  a  formula  for  use in        connection with the forthcoming trade negotiations with Denmark.(ii) Contribution  from the, Home Producer.    I was asked by the Conference of Ministers to  &quot; consider what contribution        the home producers of meat could best make in order to ensure equality        of  sacrifice in a  voluntary  restriction scheme.&quot;    I  am  giving  close        consideration  to  this problem as affecting home agriculture  generally        and I should  like to stress the administrative difficulties of reducing        home production, even  temporarily, and the  wide questions  of policy        which it involves, which I propose to put before my colleagues  in a        further memorandum.   In the meantime I have come  to the conclusion        that, as regards live-stock, until ;i review of the whole  position has been        made and an efficient scheme for the organisation of the home industry        has  been evolved  and put into operation, any  attempt  to regulate home        supplies  would be ineffectual.  I recommend therefore that as the next        immediate step in the development of the Goyernmenfs meat policy, a        Reorganisation Commission  for fat-stock  should be set up under the        Agricultural Marketing Act,  1931, as proposed  in my memorandum        CP. 368 (32) (paragraph 16).             The Secretary of State  for Scotland,  following on an Order  laid        before Parliament,  has  just constituted  the Scottish Agricultural        Organisation  Society  as  a  Reorganisation  Commission  under  the        Marketing Act  for the purpose of preparing a scheme for regulating        the  marketing  of fat-stock  in Scotland.   He  is reluctant and  I        appreciate his point of view for this Scottish Commission to be merged        at this stage into a Great Britain Commission.  The Commission which        I propose should be set up would, therefore,  be entrusted with the  task of        preparing a scheme applicable only in England and Wales, but I should        propose  to draft its terms  of reference on the lines  of the  Lane-Fox        Commission, that in liaison  with  the  Scottish Commission  and  with        Northern Ireland it would be in a position  to consider  the wider  United        Kingdom aspect  of  the problem.   An interim  report  from  such  a        Commission would be  of the greatest value in  connection  with the        proposed World  Meat Conference next year.
