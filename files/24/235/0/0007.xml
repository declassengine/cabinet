As a result of this conference the representativesof the various commercial organisations have expressed their willingness to co-operate in establishing a. voluntary body ofcontrol with a view to carrying out the recommendations of theSelect Committee and the requirements of the GovernmentDepartments.          This body will be a general consultative Committeewho will formulate general rules with which sky writingoperators will be expected to comply.   Inside the general body there will be a small expert body which will deal withthe operating and technical side of the matter and consult the conference was held.at the Home Office on the
                                                               9^                                                         - -    ol-^22nd November, 1932.    with the larger body at appropriate intervals. -  The    representatives were of opinion thai an organisation on these    lines will enable general trade interests to be considered in    connection with sky writing, without requiring particular    contracts or arrangements to exhibit in particular areas to    be scrutinised in detail by a large body.   Any such    requirement was regarded as impracticable, but it was felt    that the control exercised by the general consultative bod:/    should be sufficient to secure the protection of national    interests and to provide means for the investigation of any    complaints if need should arise.              The trade representatives undertook to ask their    Associations to nominate persons to serve on the consultative    body.              In view of the willingness of the commercial    representatives to establish a system of voluntarj&apos;- control,    it seems right to give this system a trial before embarking    on legislation.   The need for legislation is not urgent, and    if legislation should ultimately prove necessary/, the    experience of the working of the voluntary system will provide    useful knowledge of the practical difficulties for which    provision may have to be made.
