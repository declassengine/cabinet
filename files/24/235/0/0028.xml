THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT  j ; printed for the Cabinet.  December  1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.      42CP.  428  (32).                               CABINET.[E 6607/3880/34]                 -MEMORANDUM BY  PERMANENT UNDER-SECRETARY  OF  STATE    FOR  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  RESPECTING  THE  CANCELLATION    OF ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY^ CONCESSION.           ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON  PERSIAN GOVERNMENT^  REPLY.     1.  THE Foreign Office Memorandum of the 6th December (CP.  421  (32)) pointed out that the dispute was undoubtedly one which His  Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment would be entitled to take either before the Council of the  League of Nations under article  11 or  15  of  the  Covenant, or  before the  Permanent  Court of International  Justice under the Optional Clause.  As the dispute between His Majesty&apos;s Government and  the Persian  Government, which had  resulted  from the  former  having taken up the case of their national (the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), was  eminently a legal one. the Foreign Office recommended that, in the  event of  a  further  unsatisfactory reply being received  from the Persian Government, the matter should be  brought before the Permanent Court.  In their decision of the 7th December (Conclusion 85  (32) 3) the Cabinet, while recognising that there might be some doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court, decided that an attempt should be made to submit the case to that body, since, even if  the Permanent  Court  should refuse to admit the case,  the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government  would thereby be strengthened in taking whatever measures  might prove necessary to  protect the Anglo-Persian Oil Companys property.   The  Law Officers,  in their opinion  of the 7th December, stated that a decision upholding an objection to the jurisdiction of  the Court would not prejudice the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government to pursue their remedies either by a submission of the dispute to the Council  of the League of  Nations or in some other  way; indeed, they  thought  that  the  readiness  of His  Majesty&apos;s Government to submit the case to the Permanent Court would strengthen  their position.     2.  The Persian Government were accordingly informed on the 8th December (Annex 1) that, failing the withdrawal by the 15th December of the notification of the cancellation of the concession, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no alternative  to referring the  dispute to  the Permanent  Court under  the Optional Clause.     3.  The Persian reply has now been received (Annex 2). In it, after stating their grievances  against the Company and the grounds on which they considered themselves entitled to cancel the D&apos;Arcy concession, the Persian Government state that, in their opinion, the Optional Clause does not cover the circumstances of this particular case;  and they conclude by intimating their  intention  themselves to bring the matter before the Council of the League of  Nations,  on the ground of the &quot; threats and pressure which have been directed against &quot;  Persia by thiscountry.    4.  Should  the  Persian  Government  adopt this  course,  Persia  would automatically  acquire the right to demand the suspension of any proceedings instituted before the Permanent Court, because, when accepting  the  Optional Clause,  she  made  the following  reservation :  &quot; Persia reserves  the  right to      6646  [7982]                                                B
Foreign Office, December 13, 1932.require that proceedings in the Court shall be suspended in respect of any disputewhich has been submitted to the Council of the League of Nations.&quot;  A similarreservation  had previously been  made  by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  their acceptance of the Optional Clause.     5.  The situation now is that the decision of the Cabinet to the effect thatwe should inform the Persians that we would take the case before the Court hasbeen carried out; and the Persian Government have now intimated that, if  weproceed to  take  the case  to  the Court,  they  will  take  action  which  mightautomatically  produce the  result of the  proceedings before  the  Court beingstopped, and the time which had been spent on those proceedings being thrownaway.   Consequently, it is suggested  that the best course  for  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to follow now would be for them immediately to refer the dispute to the Council under article 15 of the Covenant, and simultaneously to informthe Persian  Government that we are doing so.  In so doing they can explain thatthey had intended to take the matter before the Permanent Court, but the PersianGovernment had intimated that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government did so, they would refer the matter to the Council.  If this course is followed His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will preserve before  the  Council the initiative which  they  had alreadyassumed in intimating that they would take the matter to the Court.     6.  The advantages  of His Majesty&apos;s Government forestalling the PersianGovernment by taking the initiative in having the matter referred to the council under  article 15 of the Covenant would be :  (a) That the dispute would be onour own ground, i.e.,  on the violation  of international  law  committed by thePersian Government in cancelling the concession, instead  of being on the general political ground of &quot;threats and pressure which have been directed against&quot;Persia by this country;  (b) that  we should thus be sure that the dispute was referred to  the Council  under article  15 of  the Covenant;  and (c)  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would thus be in the position of plaintiff, and able to press the Council to deal with the matter speedily.     7.  The advantage of referring  the dispute  under article 15 is  that theCouncil possesses wider powers under that article; in particular, it is bound tomake a report, and if that  report is not unanimous (the votes of the parties notcounting), His Majesty&apos;s Government would  be entitled  &quot; to  take such  action as they consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.&quot;     In view of the serious  nature of the dispute and the definite attitude whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government  have pursued, we should have no hesitation in statingthat the dispute is  &quot; likely to lead to a  rupture.&quot; and therefore within article 15.    8.  The  Persian Government are  no doubt  fully alive to the foregoingconsiderations, and it is therefore conceivable that they may now at any momentproceed with an appeal to the Council against His Majesty&apos;s Government on thelines indicated at  the end of  their latest  note  (Annex 2).   If,  therefore, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are to be sure of retaining the initiative, it seems  essentialthat their appeal to the Council under article 15 should  be made with the least possible delay.   It  is therefore submitted that permission be given to  take thenecessary steps for an immediate reference of the matter to the Council of theLeague under article 15 of the Covenant.     9.  If such authorisation is  given it may be possible to get the Council to begin dealing  with the matter before Christmas.  Otherwise  it would probably not be taken till mid-January.                                                      R. VANSITTART.
ANNEX 1.    Sir R. Vansittart (for the Secretary of State) to Mr. Hoare (Tehran).(No. 135. Most Immediate.) R.     Foreign Office, December 7, 1932, 9-45 P.M.    FOLLOWING is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram :          &quot; 1. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have had under    consideration your Excellency&apos;s note of 3rd December replying to my note    of 2nd December in regard to the Persian Governments cancellation  of the    Anglo-Persian Oil  Company&apos;s  concession.   I have the honour  to  inform    your Excellency  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  are unable to  admit  the    validity of a unilateral cancellation of  this  concession.  Such a cancellation    is a confiscatory measure and a  clear breach of international law committed    against a British company,  and His Majesty&apos;s Government feel obliged to    take the matter up in the exercise of  their rights to protect the interests    of their nationals.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government have from the  outset,  as    pointed out in my  note of 2nd December, and as repeated in the statement    made by the Under-Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs  in the House of    Commons on 5th December,  been anxious that an amicable settlement may    be reached between the Persian Government and the  Anglo-Persian  Oil    Company.   His Majesty&apos;s Government  cannot, however,  regard the Persian    Governments note of 3rd December as offering any satisfactory basis for    such a settlement.  As I explained  on 2nd December, His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-    ment  consider the  action of the  Persian Government  in cancelling  the    concession to be an inadmissible breach of the terms of that instrument, and    have therefore requested the withdrawal of the notification to the company    on 27th November.  Since the Persian Government in their reply adduce no    argument which can be regarded as in  any  way justifying their action. His    Majesty&apos;s Government must  reiterate their request.        &quot; 2. Should  the Persian Government be unwilling to withdraw their    notification of cancellation of the concession within one week from  the date    of the present note, i.e.,  before midday on Thursday,  15th December,  His    Majesty&apos;s  Government will have  no alternative  to  referring the  dispute    which  has arisen between them and the  Persian  Government  in regard to    the legality of the  Persian Governments action to the Permanent Court of    International Justice at  The Hague,  as a matter of urgency,  under the    optional clause.  In so doing His Majesty&apos;s Government would request the    court to indicate, under article 41 of the statute, the provisional measures    which ought to be taken to preserve their rights.        &quot; 3. Further, I am instructed to state that my Government do not accept    the attitude outlined in paragraph 3 of your note to the effect that the Persian    Government  cannot  regard  themselves  as  responsible for any  damage    accruing to  the company.  On the contrary, I have the honour to inform    your Excellency categorically that His Majesty&apos;s Government will  hold the    Persian Government directly responsible for any  damage to the  company&apos;s    interests,  any interference  with their premises  or  business  activities in    Persia, or any failure to afford  the company adequate protection,  and in the    event of any such damage occurring, His Majesty&apos;s Government will regard    themselves as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand    for the company&apos;s protection.&quot;    (Repeated to India, No. 26.)[7982]
        Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon. (Received December 13, 10 A.M.)                                                Tehran, December 12, 1932.(No. 225.  Important.)  R.                         (December 13,  12-5 A.M.)     MY telegram No. 218.     Lengthy note from Persian Government has just reached me.     1.  It begins by stating that, as my note had based reiteration of demand for withdrawal on [ ? fact 1 that Persian Government had not advanced any argument which would justify their action in cancelling concession, Persian  government propose to remedy this omission.  Then follow some 2,400 words describing the causes of dissatisfaction with company, including :      (1) Concession obtained by pressure, &amp;c.     (2) Amount of royalty unfairly arrived at.     (3) Persian Government not allowed to check accounts.     (4) No royalty paid during the war, in spite of repeated efforts by Persian           Government.     (5) Refusal to pay income tax.     (6) Reckless  expenditure in other  parts of the world  to  the prejudice of           Persian oil industry.     (7) Excessive cost of oil in Persia.     (8) Failure fully to exploit their Persian concession, combined with develop-           ment of fields outside Persia.     (9) Refusal to  send representative to negotiate last summer.    This part           concludes :  &apos;: Under above circumstances,  as I intimated in my former           note,  the  Persian   Government  consider  themselves  justified  in           cancelling D*Arcy concession, and they [ ? see no reason to withdraw]           cancellation.&quot;    2.  Persia has   always respected  her   international  obligations,  whileupholding her rights, and has therefore &quot; never refused to set forth its difficulties and to expose to competent international courts violations of rights of  country.&quot;    It continues : &quot; In the present  instance, as your Excellency, in the name ofyour Government and basing yourself on article 36 of statute of Permanent Courtof International Justice, alludes to  a reference to that court, I deem it my duty to draw your Excellency&apos;s  attention to the fact that, if stipulations of articlereferred to had placed examination of such question within competence of thatcourt,  the  Persian Government, of course, would not have hesitated  at all toaccept a reference to that court, but it appears that Permanent Court of Justiceis not competent for examination of differences which  have arisen between PersianGovernment  and  the company, because article 36  of said  statute designatescompetence of that court in such a way, in all cases where reference to PermanentCourt is made on basis of optional clause,  that circumstances of present case donot correspond with  them.&quot;     3.  Note goes on :  &quot;Your Excellency  repeats in paragraph 3 of your note that you consider Persian Government as responsible for losses which companymay suffer.  The  Persian Government cannot understand how,  while on the onehand they  have no participation whatever in activities of the company and onthe other hand they  have  not  interfered and do  not interfere with affairs of company nor cause them any inconvenience, any responsibility can devolve on them;  and it is on  the above grounds that I have the honour to reiterate that company itself is responsible for any losses which it may suffer.&quot;&apos;     4.  It then states, with reference to hope expressed in my note that PersianGovernment would come to terms with company, that they have never refused todo so, and  continues :          &apos;&apos;  And the reason why Persian Government  did  not take measures after     cancellation of D&apos;Arcy concession to interfere with company&apos;s institutions,     and still hold for the  time being to  same decision in  hope of  attaining     desired result, is that my Government have hoped that company, instead of     entering  into the sphere  of  disputes  over principles  and  of  judicialANNEX 2.
controversies, would not  lose opportunity of sending their duly authorisedrepresentative to Tehran in order  that he might enter into negotiationsforthwith with Persian Government with a view to concluding an agreement which  would safeguard legitimate interests of Persia.  But  in practice itappears, unfortunately, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are perhaps not infavour of such an  agreement between Persian Government and  company,because  threats  and intimidation  that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  arebringing to bear on my Government and unacceptable demands that are putforward prevent in practice  both Persian Government and company from taking a single step towards reaching a mutual  agreement;  and  althoughBritish Legation has so  far not interfered in  discussions between PersianGovernment and company it has now become an obstacle between two parties and has adopted an attitude which does away at once with  any  hope forsuccess in conclusion of a new agreement with  company, and  authorities of persian Government cannot but regret that, although His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are certainly  aware of deceptions practised on  Persian Governmentand of  their losses,  far  from advising and encouraging company to takeadvantage of good  faith of Persian  Government and to hasten ameliorationof their  situation,  are on the contrary encouraging company to  resist by pressure that they bring to bear  on Persian Government.   The PersianGovernment  consider  this  attitude  of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  asincompatible with  spirit of unrightness and desire for peace that shouldprevail amongst friendly Powers and members of the League of Nations,  and consider themselves within  their rights in bringing to notice  of Council of league of Nations the threats and pressure which have been directed against    (Eepeated  to  India,  No.  123;  Bushire.
