Report  of  an  Inter-Departmental Coziference held             at the  Foreign Office on  Tuesday, November 22v             1932, at 3o50 paiiio ,  to discuss the position which             has arisen in the Bureau  of  the Disarmament                            Conferenceo           (Circulated  to  the Cabinet  by  direction of the Prime Minister)      With the approval of the Prime Minister, a special meeting was held at the Foreign Office on November 22nd,with Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey in the Chair, Captain Eden(who had just returned from Geneva), and representativesof the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office and the three service Departments, with a view to discussing the diffi-culties which had arisen at the Disarmament Conference  inconnection with the proposed prohibition of chemical warfare and, in particular, the possible isolation of theUnited Kingdom Delegation in insisting on retaining theright of retaliation.  A list  of those present  is givenin Appendix  I.      2. It  will be recalled that,  following  a  discussion at the Cabinet held on Wednesday, November  16,  1952fCabinet 61  (52), Conclusion 10), a telegram  (No.560)was sent to  the Secretary of State  for Foreign  affairs^s,at Geneva,  in which it was made clear that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in the United Kingdom could not  possibly agreeto for pro in  all circumstances  the use of the  right of retaliation  if poison gas should be used against  thiscountry (Appendix IT) .  On November 19th a  telegram was sent to the  Dominions explaining the circumstances,pointing out the embarrassment involved in  the  isolation                          -1-
*5 c?of the United Kingdom representative at the nu?eau,  andinviting a very early expression of the views of tTisMajesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions on the issues involved (Appendix III).      3. It was explained to the Conference that if theUnited Kingdom Delegation were to persist in maintaining the right of retaliation they might be found to be in a minority of one at the Bureau, and that Sir John Simonfelt some doubts as to the grounds on vhich we based our defence of retaliation and considered that to persistwould result in our being accused of rendering impracticablethe prohibition of poison gas in war.      4. The Conference feel the utmost sympathy with the embarrassment of any United Kingdom representative whofinds himself in a minority of one at Geneva.  They venture,however, respectfully to point out that the Bureau is acomparatively small   body,     and that in any largerassemblage of the disarmament Conference we shall probably have the support of some, if not all, of the Dominions^-and perhaps of some other countries, among whom might veilbe Germany, when that country returns to the DisarmamentConference.  For reasons which will now be discussed,however, it may be possible to avoid our being placed ina minority of one even at the Bureau.      X Since this was drafted information has been        received that the Union of South Africa is at        present disposed to support the attitude of the        majority of the Bureau &quot;subject to the condition        that a substantial reduction in armaments be        agreed upon and effected&quot;.  The Government of        the Commonwealth of Australia are in general        agreement with His Majesty&apos;3 Government in        the United Kingdom.
     5. Before coming to the main suggestions for avoiding isolation, there is one technical aspect ofthe question to which the attention, of the UnitedKingdom Delegate at the Bureau might be drawn.   Gaswarfare differs from most other lethal weapons inthe respect that it does not require a long period or the provision of special machinery, or very elabor-ate apparatus to bring it into operation.   some important kinds of gas, including (according to the expert Report submitted to the Washington Conference)&quot;such useful materials as chlorine, bromine, phosgene,chloropicrin and hydrocyanic acid gas&quot; are extensivelyused in peace.   By prohibiting retaliation, therefore,the Disarmament Conference would not exclo.de the raanu-facture of several forms of lethal gas, or even rendertheir use by a belligerent, who was prepared to break the Convention, impossible at relatively short notice.So strong are the facts that experience both at theWashington and Geneva Conferences has shown that reference to chemical experts is likely to produceunanimous Reports on t is aspect of the question.   TheBritish representative at the Bureau might perhaps beable to make use of previous Reports on this question,or even, if the circumstances were favourable, suggestthat the matter- should be referred to a Special Committeof Chemical Experts.   Their Report would be likely tostrengthen his case.     5. The Geneva Gas Protocol of dune 17, 1925,which has been ratified or acceded to by 56 countries,
proscribes the use in war of &quot;asphyxiating, poisonousor other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materialsor device a&quot; between Powers that have ratified it.When ratifying this Protocol, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom made the following reservations,on the advise of the Committee of Imperial Defence:-     (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government is bound by the         Protocol only vis-a-vis those other         State;, which have sighed and ratified         the Protocol or adhered thereto:     (to) His Majesty&apos;s Government ceases to-be         bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis any         enemy State whose armed forces or whose         allies do not respect the Protocol.Reservation (to) reserves to us the right of retaliation.By adhering to retaliation, therefore, we are continuinga policy which was arrived at in 1029 after carefulconsideration and has been adhered to ever since.Many other nations ratified or acceded to the Protocolwith similar reservations.   These include not only themembers of the British Commonwealth of Nations tout alsosuch important States as France, Belgium and the soviet union.     7. The Report rendered by M, Pilotti  (Rapporteur)to the Bureau on the question of prohibition of chemical warfare (Conf. D.142, October 25, 1952, inSection 4, paragraph (iii) on page 10) also providesfor the right of retaliation.   This throws on to the critics the burden of proof  that the Powers who madethe above reservation  to  the existing Geneva Gas Protocolas well as their Rapporteur  on the new Draft convention are in  the wrong.
      8. The Conference were informed that there are three schools of thought in the Bureau on the question d?prohibition of  chemical warfare.  The first school desiresthe  complete abolition not only of chemical warfare butalso of any retaliatory measures, and of any form ofdefence, including  even gas-masks.  The second school of thought supports the proposal to abolish all forms of chemical warfare, including retaliation, but would notprohibit countries   row. providing themselves with gas-masksand, presumably, small quantities of poison gas,forpurposes of test and experiment in the evolutions of efficient protection.  mhe third school of thought, whichat present is represented by the United Kingdom, v/hilesupporting the  entire abolition of &quot;chemical warfare, wishes to retain the right of retaliation.  Among the representa-tives of the first  and second schools of thought there isa strong feeling that there can be no practicable prohibi-tion of chemical warfare unless retaliation is also barred.The  President o^ the Disarmament Conference has strongly supported  this  view.      9. The French school of thought also favours theimposition of rigid and even possibly automatic sanctions.It is undeT-3toodf however., that unless the French Delegates.are  satisfied as to the reliability of the sanctionsprovided, they will probably wish to retain the right to retaliate:   that i^ to say, their support to the abolitionof retaliation is linked up with the provision of strongsanet ions.      10. This  consideration opens up the possibility, and almost a probability,  o&apos;0 our being able to avoid being placed in a minority of one at the Bureau.  The sanctionsincluded in the present Draft Convention are so indefinitethat  there  is  a considerable probability that  the French
                                                                9 rtDelegate may himself refuse to surrender the right of retaliation.This would solve our immediate difficulties.   Mr. Eden said itmust be remembered that the attitude of the United Kingdom aloneis at oresent reserved.   \:/e shall be asked to state our position at once and the French attitude will,no doubt, be made dependentupon it and the responsibility will thus be thrown on us.     11.  The United Kingdom representative at the Bureau will nodoubt be subjected to further pressure to agree to sanctions of amore definite character.   The Conference presume that this would be resisted.   The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom has always been opposed to the acceptance of precise commit-ments involving military or economic pressure, even in cases wherelarge political considerations were involved.  One reason, among others, for this policy is that His Majesty&apos;s Government is not willing to undertake commitments which they are well aware publicopinion may not permit them to honour when the moment arrives.  Inthis attitude they have had the support of the Governments of allthe Dominions.  The Conference have no reason to  suppose that HisMajesty&apos;s Governments have altered their general  view in the matterof automatic sanctions, or that they are more ready to accept commit-ments for offences of a technical character than  for a militaryaggression on a large scale.  It is presumed, therefore, that therepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government  on  the Bureau will con-tinue to resist any further military commitments.  No doubt this willexpose us to the charge that we are making  impossible the adoptionof a new and, as its advocates would say, an improved Poison GasConvention.  Refusal of commitments, however, is  a ground on whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will receive widesupport from most if not all parts of the Empire.     12.  In the course of their deliberations the Conference gavesome consideration to the question of how the representative ofthe United Kingdom at the Bureau could best present the Government&apos;policy  in order to avoid isolation.  In this  connection attention was drawn to a  suggestion by the Prime Minister,
as recorded in tlie telegram in Appendix  II,  that,  ifpossible, the United Kingdom Delegate  should avoidliaving tc take a simple attitude for or  against  retaliation-tion.  Following this line of thought, it was suggestedthat the Delegate should,  so far as  possible, avoidpresenting a purely British case, and should deal  withthe matter, so far as he was able, in an objective manner-as one concerning the whole Conference.   For example,  he might address a question pointedly to one of the Delegateswho had been a belligerent when poison gas was introduced in 1915, and ask him whether, in similar circumstances,his Government would abstain from retaliation even if their nationals, both military and civilian, were beingexposed to poison gas attacks on a large scale for aconsiderable period while the league of Nations  wasendeavouring to establish the facts and to secure sanctionswith which to enforce its demand for a cessation of the offence.  The Delegate might be reminded how, in 1915,the Governments concerned were told by their responsiblemilitary advisers that the mora.l of their armies wasbeing undermined by abstention from retaliation.  the civilian inhabitants of large towns might also be sufferingheavy casualties .   In a future war a Government  would not even have the exowse of technical inability to retaliate                  as mentioned in paragraph 5,within a short period, sinceycertain toxic gases areeasily produced and everything is now known about their use.  The Conference were informed that the reply wouldprobably be that if there were any long delay they wouldbe compelled to retaliate.      13, &quot;his suggested the possibility that a  way out  ofthe difficulty might be to lay down a time-limit withinwhich the league&apos;s machinery would seek to obtain a cessation of the employment of toxic gas, but that afterthe expiration of that limit retaliation should  be permittee                            -6-
   This proposal has the merit that in England retaliation .   would require at least a few days to brinp poison gas into   effective use - And a good deal v/ould he gained if this   device resulted in averting the preparations which nations.   may otherwise make for using poison gas.         14. Attractive at first sight, this solution, however   was found to involve dangers and difficulties.  If, by   breaking the Convention, the offender had succeeded in   gaining possession of some vitally important strategic   objective (and wars often begin with a coup-de-main   against some such point), it would be but a small consola-   tion to the victim to have  procured  the cessation of an   offence which might already have lost him the war or put   him at a serious disadvantage in its prosecution.         15. Apart from this danger, there are considerable   practical difficulties both in fixing the length of the   time-limit and the moment from which it is to operate.   If the time-limit is too long it might enable an enemy to   obtain decisive advantages before retaliation could be   employed.  If it is too short, the Leagvie of Nations   might not have time to establish the facts, much less to   arrange the sanctions by which its demand for cessation   o^ the offence was to be enforced.  Moreover, a short   time-limit would offer opportunities to a nation that was   attempting by false accusations to establish its right to   use poison gas on the pretext of retaliation.  In this   connection it is worthy of mention that the first German   gas attack of April 22, 1915, was preceded by a statement,   in the Wolff Wireless Communique of April 17th that   &quot;Yesterday,  east of Ypres, the british  employed shells and   bombs  of &apos;asphyxiating gas&apos;&quot;.   This is a precedent thatOff icia 1  History. military.ry&quot;&quot;o&quot;peratTolisTl?o&quot;ITITf^-p7l64, footnate
might well &quot;be followed by an enemy desiring to  -cloak a &quot;breach of the Convention under the pleaof retaliation if the time-limit for the League&apos;transaction was too short,16.   The fixing of the moment from which the time-limit is to operate involves similar difficulties.If it is fixed from the moment of the offence,  oreven from the moment of the ajjpeal being lodged atGeneva, the time may be too short for the League to conduct its investigations and arrive at decisions.If it is fixed from the moment of the League&apos;decision as to the validity of the appeal, the time may be too late.17.   These considerations led the Conference to doubt whether the expedient  of a time-limit v/ascf any real value.   They suggest, however, thatthe Defence Departments should examine the mattermore closely in case the proposal may be less objectionable than appears at present.18.   In the course of the Conference&apos;s delibera-tions it was suggested that retaliation is more rapid in operation and a more formidable deterrent to a breach of the Convention than sanctions.19.   The above considerations led the conference to discuss whether any sanctions were in factlikely to prove reliable or sufficiently promptin all circumstances.    The first act of theLeague, on receipt of an appeal, would be to verify the facts,   This may not be easy,particularly in the case of a war of movementwhen the units concerned may still be actively  engaged  and  the/                     -8-
                                                         p. 1scene of hostilities changing rapidly.  There will beaccusations and c ount er-ac CXTP n t ions .  The evidenceobtained from one belligerent may not tally with thatreceived from the other, and the representatives of theLeague may differ in their appreciation of the facts .It may be necessary to visit more than one theatre of war.and points widely separated, in each theatre. A belligerentwho has decided to break his engagements is not likely to fail to arm himself with every plausible device for delay and every argument in justification.  Even after verifica-tion has been determined, the real difficulties begin in securing that sanctions are applied.  If the hostilitiesare between large nations, o^ groups of large nations,the smaller countries on their borders will probably haveneither the power nor the weapons to apply effectivesanctions.  They may well hesitate to indulge in action that may involve them in the struggle.  Even strong, neutralmay hesitate.  If the strong neutrals are at a distance from the scene their application o** sanctions would be slowExperience has shown how reluctant nations are to undertakeresponsibilities in distant fields .  Even in a European warthe difficulties would often be great.  In rore distant-theatres they might well be insuperable.  With all its merits, the Council of the League has not proved in thepast very rapid in action, and, except possibly in thecase of wars between only two small States, it seems&apos;&apos;improbable that action could be taken promptly in response to a claim of violation of the Convention.      20. &quot;&quot;he Conference does not share the view- that aPoison Gas Convention that permits retaliation is valuelessUnfortunately, as already mentioned, many forms of poisongas are, or can be, produced so easily that no Convention,either with or v ithout retaliation, can prevent its
employment at an early stage of a war by a nation thatis prepored to risk the odium attaching to a breach ofthe Convention.   In any event, therefore, the actualdisarmament obtainable is am?11, and in this respect itis not likely to make much difference whether retaliationis permitted or not.     21. The force of world opinion is probably theprincipal sanction in any event.   Although many rules of war were broken during the Great War, there were others which,, broadly speaking and subject to clebateable exceptions,were kept;  e.g., those dealing with the Red Gross;  thetreatment of prisoners of war;  the poisoning of wells;the vise of explosive and expanding bullets.   In all thesecases it was not worth while for any belligerent to disregard its undertakings.   Similarly, in the case ofpoison gas it would seem probable that in many wars theexistence of a Convention might be sufficient to deterbelligerents from its employment, at any rate for aconsiderable time.                        SUMMARY.     22. The Conclusions of the Conference may be  summed up as follows:-      (1) In carrying  out the  policy  of  the  Cabinet         the British  representative  on  the  Bureau         might consider the following methods,         according  as circumstances  permit, for         avoiding isolation:-          (a) To adhere firmly to  the policy hitherto             pursued  by His Majesty&apos;s Governments             in the United Kingdom and  the  Dominions             of refusing to enter into  definite             commitments  )r exercise of  sanctions.             This will probably compel  the  French             &apos; and other Dt. legations&quot;&quot;Tb refuse  to&quot;             abandon  the right  of reTaliation:         (b)  To present the matter not  as  a statement             of the  British case, but  as  objectively
         as possible  and as a matter affecting         all  nations,  as suggested  in paragraph.         12.     (c)  To emphasise the point  that abolition         of the  right of retaliation will  not         prevent or  impede  the production  of         those  important forms of gas which,         as shown by  earlier  international         expert  investigation at Washington and         Geneva, are  produced in time of peace         for  commercial purposes.    If  he  thinks         it likely to strengthen his  case, the         United Kingdom Delegate might  ask that         this aspect  of the question be referred         anew to inquiry by chemical experts.(2)  Even if  the United Kingdom  representative is     unable in the last resort to  avoid isolation     at the Bureau in carrying out  the  policy  of     the  Cabinet, he  can  reasonably expect to  have     the  support of most  if not  all of  the Dominions     and perhaps of some  other nations  (including,     pessibly,  Germany) in any larger  assemblage     at the  Disarmament Conference.(3)  Even if  His Majesty&apos;s Governments  were willing     to reverse their previous policy towards     commitments, sanctions are  not likely, except     possibly in cases of wars between two small     States,  to be sufficiently  reliable or prompt     in operation to be depended on to prevent the     use of gas, for reasons given in paragraph 19.(4)  On a hasty examination, the Conference cannot     recommend the proposal for  a time-limit within     which the League should endeavour to secure     desistance from the  use of  poison gas by a     belligerent, and during which resort should not     be made  to retaliation.   The Defence Depart-     ments,  however, should give further considera-     tion to  the suggestion.(Signed)  M.P.A.  HANKEY,          CHAIRMAN.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.     November 25,  1932.

JTovembe-r 193S.  10,50 p.m,.No, 560.IMMEDIATE,     Your telegram No, 595,    (Chemical warfare).     Cabinet discussed, to-day - questions of retaliation andsanctions.   It was felt to be inconceivable that governments represented at the Disarmament Conference could possibly -intencL..to allow their nationals whether soldiers or civilians to begacsed and in no circumstances resort to retaliation and thatit was equally inconceivable that they would entrust the safety*?f their nationals to vague and uncertain sanctions.     It war. decided that His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the UnitedKingdom could not possibly agree to forego in all circumstances.the use of the right of retaliation if prison gas should beused against this country.   Public opinion would nevertolerate in the future (as it had not tolerated  in  the past)our abstention from the use of this weapon ifjit were firstused againot us.   Nor could His Majesty&apos;s Government errtrust.lives of British subjects to vague and  distant sanctions such asthose contemplated in your telegram No, 391,   To have not the smallest intention ourselves of resorting to chemical warfarebut use of pojson gas against the enemy is the only effectiveform of retaliation that can be devised if gas is used against us,     The Cabinet appreciate difficult position of United kingdom representative.   Other delegations appear to have  shirked the true issues and the Cabinet request that, while  in  no circum-S-tancea a-c-ceptijag. the-ae impracticable proposals,.you do all in                          -i-
your power to avoid United. Kingdom being placed &quot;in-a^-mlovsrijtyof one, or supported only &quot;by other members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.   They leave ycu full discretion asto how to secure this hut suggest that you should, testhona fides of other states by pressing them either in public or private or both as to whether they oould really guarantee that in no circumstances whatever would they resort to poison..gas as a measure of retaliation in kind and an to whether,, ifthe proposed clauses in your telegram No.. 391 are adopted,they intend to relinquish all measures of protection, againstpoison gao including gas masks and elaborate steps they aretaking with the widest publicity to protect their  civilpopulation against the use of gas..     The Prime Minister would much profer, if possible, thatyou should avoid having to take a simple attitude  for or&apos;&apos;against retaliation.     The Cabinet were impressed by the importance  if possible of securing a oommsn. attitude en the part of all members  ofthe British Commonwealth  in a matter of  this nature, and accordingly of obtaining  the support of  the ItoniljiiAns-^r-^the-..attitude which the United Kingdom, delegatipn are forced toadopt.   The Cabinet would like you to discuss  the matter withsuch Dominion representatives as can be  made available  atGeneva with a view to securing this end.   If  there is  anyhelp which you would like us to give herp, e.g.  by telegraph-ing to Dominion governments, please let  us know at once.

(Sent 6.0 p.m.   19th November, 1932).Important.          Circular Telegram B No. 136.  Secret.          The Bureaus of the Disarmament Conference has beendeliberating upon methods of enforcing the prohibition of chemical warfare, and the United^Kingdom Delegate has been obliged to putin reservations against the view expressed by the other membersof-the Bureaus on the following two points:-          (1) retaliation and (2) sanctions.     (1) Retaliaa^Ttnn.   With the exception of the UnitedKingdom Delegate all the members of the Bureaus have beenin favour of a ruling that a State against which chemicalweapons have been used shall in no circumstances retaliateby the use of the same weapons.  They argue that to allowretaliation would be to weaken the prohibition by making it longer absolute and by affording a legitimate excuse forStates to continue to make preparations for chemical warfare.     (2) Sanctions.  The Bureaus has been working on thefollowing texts-     1.  It will be the duty of third states individuallyto take coercive measures to be determined in accordance
        with the circumstances  and  in  particular with the situation        in which each state  is  placed  in regard to the &quot;belligerents        to induce the State  which has  used chemical  etc. arms  to        abandon use of such  arms  or to prevent it from continuing        such uae.             (2)  Consultation  of third States through the medium        jf the Disarmament Commission  will take place in the        shortest period to determine measures to be  taken in common        and to decide on collective sanctions of  all kinds to  be        applied.   Such decisions will he  taken by the Disarmament        Commission by a majority  (to be specified by the Conference)        of its members;  the minority  will not be bound by such        decision but -will undertake not to obstruct  the action con-        templated.             (3)  Third States  belonging  to a particular region may        moreover pledge themselves  to  undertake urgent common        action of rigorous and  effective  nature agajnst a guilty        State and to constitute for this  purpose  a collective  forceends).   of police in advance.                  Subject to the  reservation of the  United Kingdom        Delegation this text appears to have been accepted        unanimously by the Bureau except  as regards  point 5  to        which the Italian Delegation has  objected.    The provision        (in paragraph 2) whereby a  minority cannot be to-^und by a        majority decision of the Commission to  apply collective        sanctions was no doubt_i.nte-ru.i3d to make the  text more        palatable to His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the United-Kingdom,        thnugh in fact it has the following disadvantages:-             (a)  it might in a flagrant  case be  extremely        difficult trt cast a  vote against  the use  of  collective        sanctions               (to) the fact  that  the minority is not bound very                                   (ii)
(ill)much detracts from the effectiveness and utility ofthe sanctions.          His Majesty&quot;s Government in the UnitedKingdom hold the general view that it would not be possible to agree to forego under all circumstances the right to resort to retaliation if poison gas were used against this country, or to entrust the lives of British subjects to distant and vague sanctionssuch as those apparently contemplated.          It is however appreciated that it would bevery embarrassing if the United Kingdom representative on the Bureau were placed in the position of being theonly opponent of proposals, however impracticable, whichwere supported by all the other members of the Bureau.          The matter is one which concerns all theMembers of the British Commonwealth.  Hi6 Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would appreciate avery earljr expression of the views of His Majesty&apos;governments in the Dominions on the issues involved.
