                                                  1r:\the property of His Britannic Kajesty*s Government.                                             Oj                                     Copy No. . ./. . .           CABINET. Use of Totalisators in Tote Clubs    and Greyhound Racing Tracks.         Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.          The High Court on Friday last delivered judgment on an appeal by way of a case stated by the Leeds Stipendiary(Shuttleworth v. The Leeds Gres^hound Association Ltd.) onthe question of the legalit3r of the use of the totalisatoron greyhound racing tracks .          The effect of the judgment makes it clear that theuse of totalisators is illegal on such tracks;  and by implication their use in tote clubs is also illegal.          The immediate question that arises is what action should be taken regarding tote clubs and greyhound racingtracks .          As regards tote clubs, there is no doubt that thegrowth of these clubs is viewed with great misgiving bya large  section of the public.   The main opposition to them is that  they offer increased facilities for betting andappeal to a section of the conimunity (particularly women ofall classes) which has not previously been a.ccustomed toindulge  regularly in betting.   Strong objection is alsotaken to these clubs by the racecourse interests who regard them as  serious competitors by the facilities they offer for betting off the course, and by the licensing trade whocomplain of the effect on their trade of the unfair competition of the clubs, which pa3^ only a registration feeof 5/- and an excise duty of 3d. in the pound on their purchases of intoxicating liquors.    Strong pressure has accordingly been brought to bear on the Government tointroduce legislation to make these clubs illegal, butdocument is RET.439 (32)
                                                          -;- tj ,j                       -2-Parliament has &quot;been informed that,  &quot;before deciding on their course of action, the Government saust await the authoritativedecision of the High Court on the question of the legality of these clubs .          As regards greyhound racing tracks, the position is different.   These tracks are recognised as giving to poorpeople means of enjoyment which have long &quot;been available tothe better off on horse racecourses.   There can be no doubtthat people frequenting greyhound racing tracks have cone to regard the totalisator with favour and there is equally nodoubt as to the general view that the totalisator is lessopen to objection than betting through bookmakers.          If the tote is abolished in the tote clubs, theseclubs will in most cases disappear.   On the other hand,the abolition  of the totalisator on greyhound tracks willmerely result  in the recrudescence of the bookmaker.   Itmust further be remembered that in the establishment of thetotalisator on greyhound racing tracks as distinct fromclubs a very large amount of capital is engaged on thestrength of an interpretation of the existing law which hasnow been shown to be incorrect.          In default of amending legislation, the use of thetotalisator both in tote clubs and on greyhound racing tracks,and indeed anywhere other than on horse racecourses approvedunder the Racecourse Setting Act, 1928, is illegal, and itwould be impossible for the police and. the authorities toconnive at a defiance of the law as it has now been declared.The Fetropolitan Police a.re informing the proprietors cftote clubs and of greyhound racing tracks of the effect ofthe decision of the High Court and are warning them that ifwithin a reasonable period the use of the totalisator is notdiscontinued they render themselves liable to prosecution.The police authorities outside London will no doubt follow
a similar course .          As regards tote clubs, I assume that the lav/ willbe -allowed to take its course.   Steps will accordingly betalcen to prosecute proprietors of these clubs if within areasonable period they do not discontinue the use oftotalisators.          As regards greyhound racing tracks, two courses ofaction see:: to be open, .and I shall be glad to obtain thedecision of the Cabinet on the question of policy involved:     (l)  to leave the law unaltered, with the result that   in course of time the totalisator on greyhound racing   tracks will be replaced by the bookmaker;     (2)  to introduce legislation providing for the use   of totalisators on greyhound racing tracks under   safeguards similar to those now enforced in respect of   the use of totalisators on approved racecourses.                                  J.G.mm OFFICE:     17th December, 1S32.
