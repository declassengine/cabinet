THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTRUSSIAN COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT  NEGOTIATIONS.  THE QUESTION OF RUSSIAN DEBTS AND BRITISH  CLAIMS  AGAINST RUSSIA.         Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    NEGOTIATIONS have already begun with the Soviet  Government for anew treaty or agreement to replace the Temporary Commercial Agreement of the16th April,  1930,  which was denounced  by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the17th October, 1932.    Considerable pressure is likely to be exerted by interested parties both in and out of Parliament to make these negotiations conditional upon a settlementof the claims of British subjects and  companies against the Soviet Government,as was explained in Annex  I to the memorandum submitted to the Cabinet onthe 8th October, 1932 (CP. 337 (32), p. 17).    I am of the opinion that the introduction of the question of debts and claimsinto the forthcoming commercial negotiations would merely lead to fruitless delay,and might in the meantime have an adverse effect on British trade with the soviet union, and I believe this opinion  is shared by my colleagues, but I wish to havedefinite guidance from the Cabinet on this point, which may in the future  giverise to criticism.    At the same time I am averse  from tying the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment by a final decision, without seeing how the negotiations may develop.  Apartfrom  other considerations, it may well become necessary  in the  course of thenegotiations to threaten to insist on some clearing arrangement or the impositionof some special duties, in order to get a settlement with Russia on trade questions.In that case, the claims of private British creditors could not be ruled out from consideration.    After consultation with the Chancellor of  the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, I submit  the following recommendation for  cabinet approval:         &quot; Inasmuch as notice has now been given to terminate the Temporary    Commercial Agreement  with  the Soviet Union,  and negotiations for a  new    agreement have now begun, and inasmuch as it would seem inadvisable to    introduce the question of Russian debts and British claims against the Soviet    Government  into  the course of these negotiations,  the  Cabinet  should    provisionally  decide  to maintain the previous policy of His Majesty&apos;s    Government in  keeping the question of debts and claims  apart from the    negotiations for a commercial agreement.&quot;    While I demur to making the negotiations dependent on the satisfaction ofthe claimants or even to pressing  the claims in the course of the negotiations, Ido not suggest  that the existence of the claims and our  expectation of theireventual settlement should go by  default  on this occasion.   I therefore suggestPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1932.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.  9O.P. 440 (32).CABINET.6651  [7999]
that at an early opportunity in the course of the negotiations  the British repre-sentatives should make the following reservation of our-rights-in-this-connexiom-         &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom remind the Soviet     Government that there  are debts and claims, both Governmental v/and     private,  outstanding against them; that the existence of - these-debts-and-     claims has been recognised  on several occasions by the Soviet Government;     that  their  settlement was  one  of  the conditions for the  resumption of     diplomatic relations between the two States  in  1929; and that the negotia-     tions on this subject which took place during 1930 and 1931 were discontinued     owing to the insistence of  the Soviet  Government that financial facilities     should be placed at their disposal, before they would  consider compensation     for any  categories of claims.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the United     Kingdom desire to record that they maintain and assert both their own claims     and those of their nationals.         &apos;&apos; They trust that the Soviet  Government are  till  animated by the desire     which they have expressed  on former occasions to settle this  question by     negotiation on a just and equitable basis at the earliest  convenient oppor-     tunity.   They consider that the negotiation  of a  permanent Treaty of     Commerce and Navigation must be accompanied by a satisfactory settlement     of these  debts  and claims; and they must therefore regard any commercial     agreement which may be negotiated meanwhile, as being of a temporary and     transitional character  pending a final disposal  of this question.&quot;!                                                                     J. S.December 16, 1932.
