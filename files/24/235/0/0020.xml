HOUSING POLICY.                        &apos;            Note circulated by the Minister of Health.            I have to report to ray colleagues that  I  have discussed   with the  representatives  of the Building Societies the arrangements   (previously referred to in paragraph l(iii) of CP.386(32))  which   can be made if Parliamentary sanction is given to  a proposal of   a joint guarantee  by the  State  and by local authorities of a   proportion of  advances made by  Building Societies  for the purchase   of small  houses to be let.            I conferred with, representatives of the  Societies  on   Friday, December  2nd,  and I am  able to report that the 3uilding   Societies have reduced the  level of the terms which. I had previously   been informally given to  understand they would require.   They   now propose that  the  advances under guarantee should be made for   periods as long as thirty years and at 1 per cent, under their   current rates  of  interest for ordinary loans.    This  means that   they are  prepared at present rates to  make advances under   guarantee at rates not exceeding 4-g- per cent,  in London and  the   home counties,  and 4 per  cent,  in the  provinces.    These rates   are actually below the rates which the Societies now pay.   While   there are indications that  in particular areas even lower rates of   interest  may be possible,  and while the position may be generally   improved  by variations in the market rate of interest or by joint   arrangements made  between the Building Societies,  which I   understand they will now  take Into consideration,  I was unable to   secure their assent to any further immediate reduction of the   general limiting  rates of interest.            I am satisfied  that the revised proposals submitted  on    their behalf  will,  if Parliamentary sanction is obtained for  the   guarantees, enable them to  play a very useful part in a field  which   is  new to them, namely, the provision  of small houses to bo  let to   members of  the working classes  whose circumstances are such  that   they cannot ordinarily acquire  houses  themselves.5th December,  1932,(Intld.)
