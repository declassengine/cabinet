MACDONALD said that they had  to consider the troublesome questionof the American debt. He really had not thought that the Americans would havebehaved quite in this way : but they must recognise the political difficulties ofAmerica.  At the moment there was, in fact, no political head, and no man could say that such and such a policy must be carried out. What the representatives ofthe French  and United  Kingdom  Governments  had to  do was  to preserveLausanne, and that they were going to do.   As Mr. MacDonald had  said at lausanne, they could not  present what was a united front,  but they could striveas long as possible for equal treatment, perhaps not the same, but equal treatment.He was glad to say that the United Kingdom Government had received a telegramfrom their Ambassador in Washington saying that it had been admitted to him that the United States Government recognised that Great Britain had taken upthe Lausanne position, and that the arguments which the United  Kingdom wasinvoking in that connection were very important.      6642  [7966]               &apos;                                 B
    MR! . CHAMBERLAIN tnuught that what they had to do was to make itclear to each other that they  were agreed regarding the maintenance of the lausanne position.  The Lausanne agreements were subject to ratification.  Ithad been agreed  that  ratification could not  take place  unless a satisfactory arrangement was  made  with the United States.   They had asked the UnitedStates Government to enter into discussion to see if such a satisfactory arrange-meut could  be obtained.   In effect the United  States Government had agreed, tothat, but not to the discussions taking place immediately; and the United StatesGovernment were not willing,  like the  European Governments at Lausanne, to suspend  payments until  discussion  could be completed.   Mr.  Chamberlainwondered if even at that late moment  they would not still receive some freshproposal which would make it possible  to avoid payment on the 15th December.But time was short, Congress was obstinate, the  United States administration was very frightened, and the probabilities were that by the 15th December noaccommodation would have been arranged.  What would happen if that was theposition on the 15th  December ?   The French Government knew  the british position. The United Kingdom Government regretted very much that&apos; they hadnot obtained an agreed  suspension.   If that could not be obtained before the15th December, the United Kingdom must either default or pay.  She could not say that she could not pay. That would not be true.  She could pay.  All thenthat the United Kingdom Government could say was that  it would be better forthe world that payment  should not be made.  The United Kingdom government thought it unfortunate for the world to pay; but they thought that if they didnot pay when they could, the effect would be very bad too.  They thought that itwould have effects on other countries which had debts to pay and difficulties inpaying, and that  those countries would be glad of the excuse not to pay.   TheUnited Kingdom Government thought that public opinion in Great Britain wouldbe shocked  if, when the country was still able to pay, it did not pay.   british public opinion would feel humiliated and ashamed, and, perhaps, nervous of theeffect on private debts.   Therefore, when it came to the point, and if there wasno agreement, the United Kingdom Government intended to pay. But they didnot feel that they should pay without saying anything,  as though they were beginning the old  payments again.  They would propose in paying to tell Americathat they regarded any  payment as a capital payment and one to be taken intoaccount when the  question of the whole debt was discussed, as part of any finalpayment.    Mr.  Chamberlain said that,  from the moment when they had  agreed at lausanne to a further and final payment by the German Government,  it had been clear to him that they  could not expect the  United States to  accept completecancellation; something would be sure to be asked  from them.  Well, if theUnited  Kingdom Government  paid  on  the  15th  December,  they  would paysomething which would  have to be discussed later.   That payment would not bean ordinary normal instalment of interest; but it would  be a  capital  payment,which would have to be regarded as part of  the final settlement.   They wouldalso have to point out to the United States that it was extremely desirable thatthey should discuss  and conclude the  discussion before  the 15th  June, whenanother payment became due.    Mr. Chamberlain did not yet know  what was the view of the French Govern-ment on this question or what action the French Legislature would sanction. Buthe wished to mention one other point, that of the French  debt to Great Britain.He thought that the situation was perfectly clear.  They had agreed at Lausannethat debts  between the former Allies should  be suspended until Lausanne wasratified or until it was decided that it was not to be ratified.  Neither contingencyhad yet arisen.  Therefore, there could be no question of any claim being made onFrance by  the United Kingdom for payment  now\  That would arise if Francesaid that she would make no payment to America and that she would not ratifyLausanne, or if France said that she would pay America and demand reparationsfrom Germany.  Otherwise,  the position of the French debt to  the  UnitedKingdom would remain as it was under Lausanne.    M. HERRIOT said that he understood Mr. Chamberlain  to have said thatas things were  at present the United Kingdom would not ask for the French debtunless  France  said  that she  would not pay America and would  not ratifyLausanne, or, alternatively, unless she said that she would pay America and wouldreclaim from Germany.
     He  wished, first, to thank the Prime Minister  and Mr. Chamberlain for making this meeting possible, when there were so many signs in the international situation to discourage men of goodwill.  It was very comforting to him to note the loyalty and cordiality  with which the British Ministers had treated&quot; him. That had not surprised the French Cabinet.  It was  natural on the part of the representatives of a,great nation like Great Britain.     Mr. Chamberlain had  said that he did not know the views of the French Government or Parliament.  The views of the  French Parliament were public. The French Parliament was not in a state of mind favourable to America or to payment, but the British Ministers might rest assured that they were faced with a French Government which would not be swayed by outside movements of passion. The French Government wished only to know what was its duty.     M. Herriot had received that morning a very important telegram from the French Ambassador at Washington which he read to the meeting.  A paraphrase of that telegram is attached as Annex I to these notes.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN wished to  give certain explanations respecting the bonds referred to in the telegram from the French Ambassador in Washington. Information had been conveyed unofficially to the  United Kingdom Government that if they were to propose, instead of the 15th  December payment, to hand over bonds payable in one, two or three years in lieu of the payment,  and to be held by the United States Government until maturity, that  solution might be accepted. That had been an unofficial communication.  The  United Kingdom Government had asked the British Ambassador in Washington to  put to the Secretary to the United States Treasury a proposal of that kind, and also to ask whether, if it were accepted for the United Kingdom, it would also be accepted for the other debtors.   The  reply was that  it might perhaps be accepted for the United Kingdom, but not for France.  The United Kingdom Government had replied that that might make its acceptance by them difficult; they might have to refuse it, for they did not wish any  distinction made between the United Kingdom and France.   The  British  Ambassador  in Washington was then  told, that  the President of the United States must be consulted on  this matter; and then the United Kingdom Government heard that their proposal would not be  acceptable to Congress.  They were told  that Congress might accept  a proposal under which the bonds would be marketable; and this meant  that they would be marketed and turned into cash so far  as the United States Government  was concerned; and that this was all that Congress would accept.     The  United Kingdom Government then informed the United  States Govern- ment that the proposal made by the Secretary to the United States Treasury was totally inacceptable to them.  Mr. Chamberlain thought that the explanation which he had given was not  quite in accordance with the explanation given by Mr. Ogden Mills and reported in the telegram from  the French Ambassador in Washington which M. Herriot had just read.    M. HERRIOT asked if  the United Kingdom Government knew  of certain American approaches to Germany which had been made in order to obtain a settlement of that part of the German debt to America independent of The Hague Agreement.  M.  Herriot believed that such approaches had in fact been made.    MR.  MACDONALD said that Baron von Neurath had given him no indication at Geneva that such approaches had been made.  He had as a matter of fact mentioned the matter briefly to Baron von Neurath.    M. FIERRIOT  said that  he understood that the  United States Governmenthad  in fact  asked  for  25  per cent,  cash on the special  annuity;  and  that dr. Luther had refused.    M. GERMAIN-MARTIN said that he could not at  this moment  make any suggestion for a definite solution. On the other hand, he was ready to explain the  different  courses which were open to him  and  M.  Herriot./ The FrenchGovernment was faced  with  a problem which, at the  time being, was  morepolitical  than financial.   In  fact, and  in  all loyalty, he must admit  that the december payment was possible for France.  France had the funds available, andno disturbance  in the French exchange  was to  be feared as  the result of the.December payment, if made.  But Fi-ench opinion,  notablv that of the ex-service.      [7966]                                        7.         B 2
 men and in the Chambers, did not understand that, after the reductions which had been made in the debts due to France, and the suspensions granted at the time of the Hoover moratorium and again at the Lausanne Conference, America could  refuse to grant a  moratorium  which would  in no way prejudice the execution of the French undertakings.  The French Government had never meant to use their request for a moratorium  as a means of avoiding the execution of agreements signed by them; but they thought that, on the lines of  the  Hoover moratorium and in accordance with the apparent intentions of Mr. Hoover, who had declared that the moratorium must inevitably be  followed by a meeting of debtors and creditors to revise agreements concluded, it was natural themselves to ask for some kind of postponement of payment.    M. HERRIOT wished to make French opinion quite clear to  the  British Ministers.   He had spoken  on the preceding day with MM. Caillaux and Beranger  (the  author of  the Franco-American  Debt  Agreement),  Laval and Francois Albert (President of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chamber). All these responsible personages based their views on two texts.  One of those texts was a sentence in the Washington  communique of the 25th October, 1931, at the time of M. LavaFs visit to Washington.  That communique had been signed by President Hoover, and  the sentence in question read :  &quot; As regards inter- governmental obligations, we recognise  that, before the expiration of the  Hoover year,  an arrangement covering the period of  the economic depression  may be necessary, an arrangement on the terms and conditions of which our two Govern- ments  make  all reservations.  The initiative  with respect to this  Agreement should be taken  by  the  European  Powers  principally interested,  within the framework of the Agreements existing  on the 1st January, 1931.&quot;    M. Herriot  said  that  the leaders of  French  Parliamentary  opinion considered  that, apart altogether from the Lausanne  Agreements,  Mr.  Hoover had committed himself by the sentence in the communique of October 1931, whichhe had just quoted.  That sentence explained  the  resistance to  payment in the French Parliament.  The  leaders of the  French Parliament said that, on that occasion, Mr. Hoover undertook an engagement.  Mr.  Hoover had  sent the European  Powers to Lausanne.   Those Powers  had  done their  work there. Mr. Hoover had pledged his word.  How had he kept his word 1  The leaders of French  Parliamentary opinion said that there was more than that.   BeforeLausanne,  the  Basle experts,  including an  American  expert Mr.   Walter Stewart -had signed a  report,  the  final text   of  which (which  was often misquoted)  contained the  following words :  &quot; An adjustment  of  the whole of inter-governmental debts (reparations and other war debts) (N.B. These words had been suppressed in certain texts of the Basle Report), an adjustment which must take place at once if it is desired to avoid new disasters, and  as the only means of restoring economic stability and real peace.&quot;    The following was the thesis of the  French Parliament: They did not dispute the validity of the Franco-American war debt agreement; but they thought that both in the juridical and moral  sense there had since that agreement been a &quot;novation,&quot; a new fact.  Mr. Hoover had destroyed the mechanism of reparations and debts by the Hoover moratorium and  the Washington communique and the co-operation of the American expert in the  Basle report; and now  he was the last man in the world who was entitled to refuse a &quot;moratorium to Europe.  This was not necessarily the view of the French Government, but it was  that of the French Parliament.    M. Herriot said  that feeling in the Chambers was very strong that, in  these circumstances, the French  Government  was, whilst waiting for a revision of the war debt agreement, entitled to demand an arbitration under the Franco-American arbitration agreement, and that  the British  Government  was entitled to do the same  thing under its arbitration agreement.    M. GERMAIN-MARTIN said that it was upon the basis of the texts and pacts just recalled that the French  Government had, like  the United Kingdom, asked for  a moratorium.  He could  not at the moment say what influence the feeling in the Chambers  would have upon the French Cabinet.  In theory the French Cabinet, like the French nation, desired to respect contracts entered into.    He would now examine what solutions of the question were possible apart from a moratorium.  In the whole of the examination which they had conducted
the French Government attached  importance to finding a solution which couldbe accepted both  by Great Britain and  France.   It  would be a disaster forcivilisation and humanity if America succeeded, in what was a question of money,in dissociating the two countries.   The French  Government had considered thepossibility of many solutions : (1)  a payment by means of a deposit at the Bankof International Settlements; (2)  the delivery of bonds  to the United  States;(3) the creation of a bond like that proposed under the Hoover moratorium whichwould be  amortized  in  ten years; (4) a  cash payment.  Whatever method of payment was adopted, in agreement, he hoped, with  the United Kingdom, France-would be absolutely decided to say that that was the last payment; that it wasnot a payment of interest or otherwise; but that it was  a payment  to be creditedagainst the final settlement; further, France would require that final settlement to be inspired by the  methods of Lausanne.   In justice it could not be otherwise.The insistence of the  United States to treat separately with the various european powers meant that one day France might be a heavy debtor whilst  germany would be free of all  obligations.  On the other hand, if, as America told  themunofficially at the time of Lausanne, she would take account of the lump  sumfixed at Lausanne and the methods followed at Lausanne which had been inspired by a desire to find a basis of settlement with her,  Europe would  then be goingto a settlement with America  within  a general  framework.   They would be working towards it with the advantage that henceforward they would leave  aside the calculations so disastrous in the past,  regarding capacity of  payment, andthat they would be clinging to a universal settlement based on normal transfersbetween nations.  M. Germain-Martin thought that one of the great advantages of Lausanne had  been to have  made clear the truth that no  massive paymentsbetween nations were possible  unless goods were  moved to  cover them.  Hewondered whether  the British representatives wished  to  give any  furtherexplanations of their point of view.    M. HERRIOT  thought that Mr. Chamberlain had  explained clearly  thatthe tendency of the British Government was to make a payment, not as a normal and automatic payment  under  the existing agreement, but  as a last  paymentunder a final settlement, a payment in cash.    MR. MACDONALD said that there was no question of paying in instalments..    M. HERRIOT thought that the most important question was to know if theywould act together or separately.  He was well aware of the American objectionsto the single front; America&apos;s policy was &quot; Divide and rule.&quot;   She always  madeconditions  and  accepted none.  If his  English   friends preferred  to  treatseparately and answer separately  after this frank explanation, he would accept their decision in view of their loyalty and the confidence which he had in  them.    M. Herriot wished to make the following observations: First, the very factthat they had met  to-day  showed that  they were  consulting.  The world and america knew that they were consulting.   Secondly, if they succeeded in agreeingon the conformity, if not the identity, of their answers, there would be one great advantage;  Italy would  be with  them.    For the  Grand Fascist Council had decided to make a payment in December as a last payment; and that, he under-stood, was generally the British attitude.  Belgium would also probably followsuit.  Thirdly, if they agreed now to make their answers conform to one another,they would appear not merely as  recalcitrant debtors, but as  nations anxious tosecure the restoration of the economy of the world by recognising the importanceof the possibility  of  transfer.   They would be standing together on the basis ofthe doctrine enunciated at Lausanne.  Fourthly, though he was not going to allowhimself to be influenced by French parliamentary opinion,  he would  in  such-circumstances have more chance of carrying the French Chambers with  him..    M. Herriot understood that the British Ministers were in favour of separatenotes, though the contents would  be generally the same, i.e., there would be. thesame general conditions, payment against a final  settlement,  &amp;c. It was very important for him to be able, in the forthcoming debate, to show that the FrenchGovernment was acting generally on the same lines as the United Kingdom and as.other European debtors.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that M. Herriot had put two alternatives.   Thefirst was separate action, though not without prior consultation.  So far.as he knew they were not disagreed  as to the  general lines they were each  to follow.       [79GG]  &apos;                                                  B  3   &apos;&quot;&apos;H
Therefore, the effect of their answers would be the same.   The second alternative was that  Great Britain and France should  act  together.   In that case,  wasM. Herriot in favour of a joint note; he understood not; hie thought he meantseparate replies saying the same thing generally.  What was the exact differencebetween these two methods?     M. HERRIOT said that the position was more embarrassing for him than for the United Kingdom Government.   Might he ask if the  United KingdomGovernment had definitely decided the line which they would follow ?     MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said that  subject to anything  which  happenedbetween now and the 15th December, the United  Kingdom  had prepared a  note to America on the lines already described.     M. HERRIOT thought that they could  conclude from these conversationsthat they  were  moving towards an identical action.     M. GERMAIN-MARTIN  saw  the situation  as  follows:   The  FrenchGovernment  was less  free than  that of  the United Kingdom because  of thedifficulties with their Parliament.  M.  Herriot had  given undertakings to the commissions.     MR. MACDONALD  said that they could not  have British policy  explained by a French  Minister in a French Parliament.     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that it was very important that there shouldbe no  misunderstanding.  M. Herriot had said that they seemed to be movingto an identical conclusion.  As the British Ministers saw the position at  present;they would not say that the December payment was a final payment;  but  theywould say that it was not a resumption of ordinary payments;  it was a capitalpayment,  and must be  taken into account in any final settlement.   That wasdifferent from saying that this was the last payment of all.  He did not thinkthat that would be at all a diplomatic procedure.     M. HERRIOT said that the British Ministers had explained the generaltendency  of  their Government and  the  probable sense of their  answer.  TheFrench Ministers had explained the facts and the documents and the reasons which, in the present state of French  parliamentary  opinion would justify a refusal to pay or a demand for arbitration. He would like the British ministers to examine that possibility.     He had  promised to go before the Commissions on the following day andto inform them before the French Government  took its decision.  Then would comethe decision  of the Cabinet and a  meeting in the Chamber probably  on the12th December.  He would endeavour to turn French policy towards the  solution to which the British Ministers inclined.  The direction which they were followingwould be an element  in  the decision of the French Government; and if theFrench Government could come to the same decision  the two countries would be acting in  agreement.  But before converting the Chambers M.  Herriot said thathe and M. Germain-Martin would have to convert the Government.  Should theBritish Ministers change their  point of view he would be glad to know at once.Otherwise the  French  Government  would know  that  if they paid under theconditions explained by the British  Ministers the two Governments would  be acting on similar lines.     MR. MACDOJMALD said that the British Ministers would certainly reflecton, all that had been  said, and  that  if their general  point of view was  changed the. French Government would be informed at once,  lie would, however, beg hisFrench colleagues to  think not only  of Franco-British  relations, but also of thefuture relations of the  two countries with America.   Were  anything  done to unite  America  against Europe  these  conversations would  have  been a badbusiness.  It seemed to him that  the two Governments were moving in much thesame direction, and that nothing more needed to be said.  They were both trying to carry out Lausanne,  and America knew that, and  it was  not necessary forthe two Powers to use exactly the same language to convince America of that;     MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that they must always try&quot; to keep their objective in front of them.  Their objective was an agreed  settlement with America whichwould be satisfactory to them  all.   The British  Ministers would now  consider-
-what had been said by their French colleagues, but he  did not think that theBritish Government would change its decision.  As regards arbitration, he didnot think Congress would accept that, and as the  time was so very short he didnot think it practicable.  As regards any other arrangement he wanted his Frenchcolleagues to understand the importance  of  feeling in Great  Britain.  He wasthinking  of the moral sense of his countrymen.  If that was shocked the  british ministers would be doing irreparable harm.   The moral opinion of Great britain was not at present prepared for default.    If, on the other hand, America  continued  to  be obstinate she might raisesuch feeling in Great  Britain that it would be possible to take the course whichhe had mentioned, but the moment for that  was not yet.   He did  not think theBritish Government were likely to change their minds.    If France took one course and Great Britain and Italy another, he  wanted the French Ministers to realise that America  might say that the arguments which the French had used about the Hoover-Laval communique and the Baslereport had not been sufficiently powerful to induce Great Britain  and Italy torefuse  payment.  Why, in  those circumstances,  should  France attempt  thosearguments?   He was told that feeling against France in the United States was strong  and growing.  If France took a different line  to the other european countries that feeling would increase.  It was not in the long run the interestof Great Britain that France should be in a worse position than she or  in aposition  in  which  she  could not ratify Lausanne.  British opinion  wantedLausanne ratified and did not desire that anything should make that ratificationdifficult.    If Great Britain was thinking of her own position without Europe, she might say that  it would have been a good thing that she should pay and that france should  not have paid.  For  if France did not pay, Great Britain could say to america  that she could  not be treated worse than  France.  But while that factmight encourage America to give Great  Britain better  treatment than  France,that would mean the collapse of Lausanne.    Mr. Chamberlain thought that if the French  Government and Chambers could take the  same view as the British Ministers, it  would be advantageous for bothGreat Britain and France.    Mr.  Chamberlain asked, lastly, whether, since they wanted a concrete settle-ment with America, the British plan was not the best devised for that purpose.Congress would not like hearing that the 15th December payment must be takeninto account against  the final settlement;  but the Administration would not object; and in this  connexion Mr. Chamberlain referred to the telegram which m. Herriot had read from the French Ambassador in Washington (see Annex 1).America  had  asked Europe to make payment as the  best means  of securing asatisfactory settlement, and  to do so  would be the  best way to begin discussionsfor the final settlement and to end the bad feeling in the United States.    M.   HERRIOT  said   that  there  was  nothing  contradictory  between mr. Chamberlain&apos;s statements and his own.  The duty of the French Ministerswas to explain the  position to the French Parliament,  which might overthrowthem in the near future.  It was also to explain to the United Kingdom Govern-ment why France was so badly disposed to payment.    He and his colleagues were well aware  of the anti-French campaign  in the United States, and theycould do  nothing against it in view of the attacks of the Hearst Press, &amp;c.  Butlet them not forget that the United States had signed and not  ratified the Treatyof Versailles.   France could oppose her national conscience to that of America.France would not incline her national pride before America.  France was not now acting from  motives of cupidity.  She had accepted the loss of her creditsolde at Lausanne.  But she would ill admit that America, who had abandonedVersailles after writing reparations into the fourteen points, should treat Francelike this; and she would say so frankly to America.  He would not now refer to the cynical attitude of America at Geneva and the  manner in which she hadadvocated an aviation regime for Europe whilst refusing it for herself.  france would not take lessons in morality from a people like the United States, whichabandoned the obligations such as Versailles, which they  had signed.    The  reasons dictating the conduct of  the French nation were honourable anddrawn  from its feelings  of justice.  If that nation revolted against America, itwas because Mr. Hoover, who had tried to make France  accept a moratorium in
 three days, now treated her like this.  Mr. Hoover sheltered himself behind the Monroe  Doctrine; and when  he wanted  something from  Europe  he  treated Europe as though she were a colony, and as though the Europeans were negroes.     M. Herriot said that he had now explained the point of view of France, and the  British Ministers  had explained that of the  United Kingdom.  He and M. Germain-Martin perfectly understood the British position and they would do all they could to meet it.     There remained a point to which he wished to call the attention of the British Ministers; they hesitated to say that the December payment would  be the last payment under  existing agreements,  at least as far as he understood.  In the important telegram which he had read to the meeting the French Ambassador in Washington had said that Mr. Ogden Mills had definitely stated  that the best solution would be that Europe should say that the December payment was the last payment to be made in virtue of existing agreements.  M. Herriot understood that certain Americans realised this, but  they did  not  dare  to do what Europe had done at Lausanne.  He thought they ought to say definitely that the December payment would be the &quot;last payment in virtue of existing agreements.&quot;     MR. MACDONALD said that the words used  by the Chancellor  had meant that they had  made the last payment under  the  old  agreement and that the December payment was the first and last of its kind.  The British position was that they had made their  last  payment under  the  old agreement, and they said that they were going to  say that, when America presented them with a note under the old agreement, it was not the payment asked  for in the American  note which was being made, but a payment equivalent to that asked for in order to show that the United Kingdom would not default.  But it was also the first and last of this kind of payment.  Before June they hoped that there would be a meeting and that a new agreement would be  made.    M.  HERRIOT said that he understood that Mr. MacDonald had said that the United Kingdom was going to pay in December in order not to default, but that it would not pay under the old agreement but against the new  agreement.    M.  GERMAIN-MARTIN  asked  if he  might put one more question, as the answer  to it would  facilitate  the  task of the French  Government  before the Chambers.  Were the United Kingdom Government inclined to payment by bonds or by deposit or in cash ?    MR. CHAMBERLAIN replied that the payment, if  made, would be made in gold; cash in gold.    M.  GERMAIN-MARTIN  said  that he was  very much  obliged for this answer.    MR. MACDONALD said that he thought that they had now done all that they could do.    The press communique was then drafted and  is attached  to these notes  as annex II.                 (The meeting then adjourned at  2-15  P.M.)
Translation of a Paraphrase of a, Telegram from French Ambassador in  -             Washington to Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Conversation between Mr. Ogden Mills and M. Monick, Financial Attache  to                            the French Embassy.    MR. OGDEN MILLS.  It is true that we are preparing a note in reply tovour second communication.    M. MONICK.  Will you hand it to us in the near future ?    MR. OGDEN MILLS.  I do not think we can wait any longer;  we shall therefore hand it to you in the very near future.    M, MONICK.  Will  the President  also send a special message to congress on the Debt  question?    MR. OGDEN MILLS.  In my opinion the President  will, in fact, send aspecial message to Congress.  Nevertheless, we are not very sure at the momentwhat  to put in this message.   We  have  announced to  Congress that we wererecommending  special messages  in the  case  of  those  countries which  areexperiencing transfer difficulties.    We  have approached Great Britain on thispoint, but we have not received a reply.  All possible advances have been made toher; in particular a proposal for three-year bonds.  &quot; Make us some suggestions &quot;we said to her.  We have received no reply,  unless it is &quot; Are you offering the sameto the French ?&apos;&apos;  We said &apos;&apos; Yes,&apos;&apos; knowing, of course, that there was no chanceof Congress  making  any concession to France.   Nevertheless,  Great Britainpractically refused to speak; and to-day  the British Chancellor of the exchequer is going to Paris.  In our opinion there is between France and Great Britain amuch more solid understanding than has been announced.    M.  MONICK:   Do  not  delude  yourself with  ideas  of  a  plot.    Itis  quite  natural  that  France  and   Great  Britain  should  take  up  acommon  attitude.   This attitude  results  from the  facts   of   the  case,and   that  is  what   gives  it   its  strength.    The  United   States  desireto  force  Europe to choose  between  the  execution  of  Lausanne,  which represents the Future, and the execution of the Debt settlements, which are thePast.  We  have deliberately  demanded  of  them to  avoid this very graveeventuality by granting the suspension of the instalment due on the 15th December.I would also point out to you that you are  insisting upon this payment, althoughthe President-elect has made no firm promise of revision, and although on the otherhand your own Government is not in a position to make such a promise.    MR. OGDEN MILLS :  1 fully  appreciate the difficulty of your situation.We understand better now  the European position.  The  debtor nations haveresolved to bring about at all costs a revision of the debts.   By what means  can best be determined the character of this  final  settlement,  such  is the questionwhich Europe is asking itself : is  it by default or by one payment with a solemnreserve showing that it is the  last  payment to be made in virtue of existing agreements ?  This last solution would be very much the best.  Between these twoextreme solutions there is nevertheless room for an intermediary method such asthat of negotiable bonds which were suggested to England.    M. MONT.CK :  The  European  nations can always  borrow  directly on  themarket; this solution therefore does not  constitute a genuine offer on the part ofthe  United States.  The adoption of this  compromise would not produce on theAmerican  public any effect whatever.   The  debt question would  not  have advanced a  single step.   What is  required  now  is a  definite solution in  theinterests of all  and even of the United States.    MR. OGDEN MILLS :  I recognize that there is some foundation in this argument, but in  that case it would  be necessary to adopt the solution of a last
ANNEX II.                           Communique to Press.    The two Governments have explained to one another the state of  public feeling in Great Britain and France.  In a very exhaustive exchange of viewsthey have considered their position in regard to the Lausanne agreements; andthey have examined the difficulties arising out  of  the nayments  due on the15th December, 1932.    While reserving their independence  of action in  dealing with this matter,they have affirmed their common determination to continue to act in order  toobtain by international  co-operation the measures calculated  to promote theeconomic restoration of the world.    December 8, 1932.opayment preliminary to a revision.  It is this solution which would produce thegreatest effect upon American public opinion.    On taking leave M. Monick reminded the Secretary of the Treasury that inFrance it was the Parliament which was master of the decision to be taken.
