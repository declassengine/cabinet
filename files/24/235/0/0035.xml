THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT138Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.     9CP.  435 (32),                                CABINET.                                 MALTA.           Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    A BILL  entitled &apos;1 An  Act to Amend the  Criminal Laws &apos;&apos;  has recentlybeen introduced by Ministers in the Maltese Legislature, and had its first reading.The Bill is of a very sweeping character, designed to penalise any expression of opinion derogatory to the Roman Catholic religion.   It contains  a clausewhich is equally designed to  penalise criticism of any cult tolerated by law, butprovides that  in that case the punishment shall be reduced by two degrees (i.e.,by about half).  The effective clauses form an appendix to this paper.    I am advised that the Bill is not in conflict with any particular section  inthe Malta Constitution  and  is  therefore  within  the  powers of  the  localLegislature.   I think, however, that my colleagues will agree  with me  that ameasure of this kind is not only obnoxious and improper, but also  a clear abuse of the powers  which have been conferred on the Legislature.  Power exists underthe Constitution by which  the Governor  may reserve any  law passed  by theLegislature for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.  The relevant sectionsrun as follows :          &quot; The Governor may reserve any Law passed by the Legislature for the    significance of Our  pleasure thereon,  and unless he shall have previously    obtained Our instructions through a Secretary of State upon any Law of the    nature hereinafter described,  or  unless  such  Law  shall  contain  a clause    suspending the operation thereof until the signification in the island of our    pleasure  thereupon,  he shall reserve          (a) Any Law whereby persons not of Maltese birth or descent may  be               subjected or made liable to any disabilities or restrictions to which               persons of Maltese birth  or descent are  not also  subjected  or               made liable.         (&amp;) Any Law of the nature described in subsections (3), (4) and (5)  of               section 41 of  these our Letters Patent.         (c) Any Law which may repeal, alter or amend,  or is  in any way               repugnant to or inconsistent with, -such provisions  of these Our               Letters Patent or such provisions of Orders in Our Privy Council               extending to  the Island as may under these  Our Letters  Patent               be repealed or altered by the Legislature.         &quot; A  proposed Law reserved for Our pleasure shall  not have any force    unless and until, within one year from the day  on which  it was presented  to    the Governor for Our  assent, the Governor  makes known, by speech  or    message to the Senate and the Legislative Assembly, or by proclamation, that    it has received  Our Assent.&quot;  (Sections  48  and 49 of  Malta  Constitution    Letters Patent.)    I consider, therefore, that the correct course is to proceed under these sectionsand to instruct the  Governor to exercise  his  powers of  reservation if the Billis passed by both Houses of the Legislature substantially in its present form, andto inform him that in due course I shall advise His Majesty not to signify his.assent to it.                                                 (Initialled)       P. C.-L.    Downing  Street, December 17.  1932.      [7998]
