WHILE the Cabinet were meeting on Wednesday, the 30th November, we received notice that the Prime Minister desired us to meet as soon as possible toconsider certain aspects of the situation created by the unilateral  cancellationby the Persian Government of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s concession and possible threats  to  the Company&apos;s Oilfields.   We met the same afternoon at P.M., when Sir Maurice Hankey  communicated to us the  Cabinet&apos;s Terms ofReference contained in a Cabinet Minute which is reproduced in the Appendix tothis Report.    2. We held a second meeting  on Thursday, the 1st December, at which wehad the advantage of learning something of the views of the Anglo-persian oil Company from Colonel H. E. Medlicott, D.S.O.,  Deputy Director of theCompany, who  has always co-operated loyally in the schemes that have been drawn up for the protection of the Persian Oilfields.    3. As  a  result  of  this second meeting we are now able  to present a preliminary Report, although  there are certain aspects of the question  which require a more exhaustive examination.    4.   The Cabinet and the  Committee of Imperial Defence are aware thatthere  is  in existence an emergency scheme  for  the defence  of the PersianOilfields.  That scheme, however, is subject to considerable limitations.  Firstly,the contingency envisaged is limited to the  defence of the oilfields in the eventof local disturbances, due to a weakening of the authority of the  Central Govern-ment in Persia.  Aggression instigated  by the Persian Government itself is not considered.  Secondly, the scheme depends upon the despatch of reinforcements from India (which may  or may not be available), prior to the arrival of whichthere may be no organised means of defence whatsoever.  As the present PrimeMinister remarked when it came before  the Committee of  Imperial  Defence :&quot; If an emergency occurred, whatever forces could be made available would haveto be employed &quot; (C.I.D. 253rd  Meeting  (7)).    5.   The situation at the moment at which this Report is produced may be summed up as follows :  On the 28th November the British Minister at Tehranreported that Mr. Jacks, the representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil company the Existing Defence Scheme.The Present Situation.[7941]B
 at the Persian Capital, had on the previous evening received a note from the Minister of  Finance declaring the Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company&apos;s concession cancelled, in view of the Company&apos;s failure to accept modifications.  At the same time the Minister of Finance had expressed willingness to examine the possibility of giving a new concession.  On the following day,  the 29th November,  it was learned that the police were removing or obliterating the Company&apos;s signboards, and  that the illumination of the town had been ordered to  celebrate  the event. This  celebration  has since taken  place.  In the meanwhile,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government has lodged  an emphatic protest (F.O.  telegram  to Tehran, No. 132, of the 30th November).     6.  Colonel Medlicott reports that up to date there has been no interference with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s property, whether on the oilfields or  at Abadan,  where the refineries are situated and the oil is  shipped.  Work  is proceeding  regularly and without interruption of any kind.     7.  In  carrying out  the Cabinefs instructions we have considered the subject under the following heads:       (1) Immediate  action of a military character to assist the diplomatic repre-            sentations of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     (2) Preparatory action for later emergencies.     (3) Military action  if the crisis should develop unfavourably.                      The Question of  Immediate Action.     8. We rejected at  the outset any  movement of troops for the  protection  of the Persian Oilfields or any Air operations involving flight over Persian territory, as provocative and  inappropriate to the  present situation.     9. As requested by the Cabinet,  we have given  special attention  to the question  of whether the movement of men-of-war would be advisable  at the present juncture.   The  present dispositions of His  Majesty&apos;s  Ships are not unfavourable to appropriate naval movements if required.  There are four Sloops at Henjam Island,  within between 36 and 48 hours&apos; steam of Abadan.   They could be sent at any moment to Abadan, though the Persian  Government  should receive notification.   The  Fourth Cruiser Squadron  is at  Bombay, and the Flagship  (H.M.S. Hawkins) is due to visit Muscat  on the 9th December and afterwards  to carry out  an arranged cruise in the  Gulf, spending  Christmas  at Basra.  The  Flagship or, if  necessary,  the  whole Squadron could  be  moved forthwith.     10.  We had, of  course,  invited Colonel Medlicotfs attendance  primarily to give us assistance on the local aspects of the military  question, but we thought it right to take advantage of his presence to ascertain the attitude of the Anglo- Persian  Oil  Company  towards  the  question of  movements of  warships. Colonel Medlicott, speaking, of course, solely from the point of view of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, was averse from the movement of Sloops to Abadan,  or any other naval movements bearing obviously and  publicly  on the present situation until there  was a clear threat of interference with the Company&apos;s property. He traced, for our benefit, the course of the negotiations which have been proceeding for some  time past  between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the PersianGovernment for an&apos; alteration, and probably a lengthening,  of the Company&apos;s concession.  These negotiations, he informed us, had  broken  down  owing  to the exorbitant demands of the Persian Government.   The present crisis  had been precipitated by the fall in royalties to the Persian Government owing to reduced profits resulting from  the world depression.  He laid  emphasis on the  ignorance of the  Shah himself and most Persian Ministers as to world conditions, and, indeed, conditions in Persia outside of the High Plateau, and  ou the changes that are taking  place in the  authority  of the  different persons who  exercise  power under the Shah. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, he informed us, have their own representative  at Tehran, who is  always in close touch with the British Minister, but who does his best, so far with  success, to keep the affairs  of the. Company segregated from  the numerous questions at  issue between London and Tehran.  He was by  no means unhopeful  that the Company might succeed  in settling the present dispute, and he  did  not  anticipate that the action  of the
 Persian Government in cancelling the concession would be followed by direct action on the oilfields.   In these circumstances, so far as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were concerned,  he deprecated any action calculated to embarrass the Company&apos;s negotiations by giving provocation to the Persian  Government.  At the same time Colonel Medlicott did not conceal his satisfaction  that the Sloops were within two days&apos;  steam of Abadan, though, if they were moved at all, he suggested that it would be preferable  to send them to Basra, where they would be close at hand, rather than to Abadan, so long as the present situation prevails. He thought also that there would be positive advantages in the Flagship carrying out the cruise, already planned, to  Muscat and the Persian Gulf.     11.  We do  not pretend to judge of the political  aspects of the situation. Unless the Foreign Office, from  their wider aspect, consider that naval movements are required to strengthen  the hand of  their Minister at Tehran, we do not at the moment recommend  either that the Sloops should be  moved  from Hen jam to Abadan or  Basra, or that  the programme of  the Flagship should be interfered with.  The ships are available at short notice, and the situation should be watched carefully in case fresh dispositions may  become necessary.                    Preparations for  Later Developments.     12.  As just mentioned, His  Majesty&apos;s Ships are available at short notice. We have considered whether there are any other preparations that ought to be put in hand immediately.     13.  The existing scheme provides that, in  the event of trouble at Abadan, Air forces would make a demonstration at that port.  Such action would be taken from Basra, and certain stores  (such  as barbed wire,  pickets,  bombs  and ammunition), which are held in immediate readiness at Hinaidi,  could be moved down to Basra.   The Anglo-Persian  Oil Company, however, have  always  been very much opposed to our taking any measures,  such as storing material for use- in Persia, or even labelling them for use there.  As Colonel Medlicott was hopeful that the situation need not necessarily  deteriorate, we do  not recommend moving these stores at present.     14.  At the moment we do not recommend the moving of any troops, or even the issue of special orders.     15.  If the situation should deteriorate,  the earliest possible notice shouldbe conveyed to the War Office and Air Ministry, as well as to the Admiralty, inorder that appropriate  orders (wdiether for movement or  mere warning) may beissued in regard to ships, troops, aircraft or stores.             Possible Action if the Situation should  Deteriorate.     16.  This part of our Report must be considered under two headings :      (1) Trouble in the oilfields of a secondary order, such as is provided for in           the existing  defence  scheme.     (2) Forcible interference with the Company&apos;s property or military aggression           by the Persian Government.     17.  Before discussing these two  contingencies there is one point made by Colonel Medlicott which to some extent affects both contingencies.  He was veryinsistent that, if troops were to be employed, British (white) forces should be used.Although the Shah has  clone his utmost, by inviting the leaders of the Bakhtiaritribes  to Tehran to secure their allegiance, the tribesmen  are by  no meansenamoured of the Central  Government, and they have material interests in themaintenance of  the  Anglo-Persian Oil Company.   Colonel  Medlicott suggests that these tribes are likely to resent action against the Oilfields  by  the Persian Government.  The tribesmen, he reports,  despise Assyrian or Iraqi troops, and have  no liking for  Indian troops. British forces, however,  and, above all, if accompanied by some judicious expenditure of British gold, would produce a decisive  effect. - Their presence would  bring back memories of the War period,when British prestige  was very  high.  It might  be  possible to bring troops by air from Egypt,  and Colonel Medlicott reports that the Anglo-Persian Oil       [7941] &apos;                                                    B 2
Company could arrange to house and maintain them.  If British troops are notavailable,  Indian troops are preferred to Assyrian or Iraqi troops.   We are considering, further, the possibility of utilising British troops in either of thecontingencies contemplated.Local Disturbances.    18.  Minor troubles in the oilfields, involving sabotage or threats of sabotage,might  arise either  owing  to the  Bolsheviks taking advantage of the present dispute or from the initiative of the Persian Government.  The  Company&apos;s firstmove  should  be, as on past occasions, to ask for protection  from the Persianauthorities.   If the trouble was instigated by Bolsheviks, it is probable that suchprotection would be forthcoming.  If it were stimulated by the Persian Govern-ment, that would not be the case, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would askfor assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government.    19.  In  the latter case the Government would  have  to  take  an importantdecision, as to whether they were  prepared  to intervene on Persian soil for theprotection of the personnel and dependants, and the property of  the  Anglo-Persian Oil Company.   If they should decide affirmatively, the existing defence scheme, or some modification thereof, would have to be implemented without delay.It involves evacuation of  the dependants of the Company&apos;s employees from the oilfields to Basra, and, if necessary, of the employees themselves: local protectionof the Company&apos;s installations at  Abadan, and,  so far as possible, of vulnerable points inland, by means of naval landing parties in the first  instance,  air forces from  Iraq, and later of a Battalion from Karachi,  to be strengthened later by three further Battalions.    20.  How far these arrangements might prove applicable to a deterioration of the existing situation is problematical, and is being investigated further.  Inaddition the  political objections to requesting India to send troops to the Gulfrequire most careful consideration.Military Aggression by the Persian Government.    21.  If the situation should deteriorate  further and the Persian Governmentshould show signs of military action for the  seizure of the oil wells, a much more serious situation would arise,  for which the present  defence scheme does not provide.    22.  In that event it would be necessary to consider not only concerted naval,military and air action for the local defence  of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;sproperty in Southern Persia, but  also retaliatory action against such objectivesas the Sloops of the new Persian navy, Custom-houses, or other possible objectivesat the ports, and, possibly, islands such as Henjam and Basidu. We are exploringthese matters further and will deal with them in a later Report.  In doing so wedo not overlook that care might be necessary to avoid action calculated to prejudice our position in the various questions that are under consideration  by the Leagueof Nations at Geneva.    23.  There  is  one  general point to which we desire  to  draw  attention.Colonel Medlicott stated  that  on  past  occasions much harm had been done  byfalse reports that were spread all over the  world  by Press Agencies,  emanatingsometimes  from places comparatively remote from the Persian  Gulf, such  asBaghdad, Amman or Jerusalem.  Such reports were liable to scare the employesof  the Anglo-Persian Oil  Company in the Gulf  and their relations at  home, andto  encourage the Bolsheviks to egg on the Persian  Government.  We  do  not know if any action can be taken to forestall or promptly to contradict such reports,but we commend the matter to the Foreign  Office and  Colonial Office.                          SUMMARY  OF  CONCLUSIONS.     24.  The conclusions  and recommendations of-  this interim report may be summed up as follows :      The Question of Immediate Action.         (1)  Any movement of troops to Persia or air operations involving flight     over Persian territory would be provocation and inappropriate to the present     situation (paragraph 8).
    (2)  The present dispositions of His Majesty&apos;s ships are favourable, incase it is desired to move them to Abadan to make a demonstration in thePersian  Gulf  (paragraph  9).    But the  Anglo-Persian   Oil  Companydeprecate any movements which might embarrass their negotiations by givingprovocation to  the  Persian  Government  (paragraph 10).   In  thesecircumstances we do not recommend any movement of His Majesty&apos;s ships or that the programme of the Flagship (H.M.S.  Hawkins) for  a visit toMuscat, followed by a cruise in the Persian  Gulf, should be  interfered with(paragraph 11).Preparations for Later Developments.    (3) Although  at the  present  moment we do not recommend that  and preliminary action should be taken  involving  the movement  towards thePersian  Gulf of  His  Majesty&apos;s  ships,  troops, aircraft or  stores   (para-graphs  13  and 14), we recommend that the situation  should  be carefully watched, and the earliest possible notice of any  deterioration therein shouldhe conveyed: to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.Possible Action if  the Situation  should Deteriorate.    (4) A  representative of the  Anglo-Persian Oil Company has impressed on  us the  importance, from the  point of view of the  Bakhtiari tribes, of using British (white) troops in preference to Indian or, above all, Assyrianor  Iraqi forces  (paragraph 17).   We are examining this proposal further,as it might be possible to convey British troops by Air from Egypt.Local Disturbances.    (5) If local disturbances should arise, the first move of the Anglo-persian oil Company should be to invoke protection from the Persian Government.1 f the disturbances were instigated by Bolsheviks, who had taken advantageof  the  present  dispute, it is probable  that  Persian protection would be forthcoming.  Otherwise the Company would  ask  for  assistance from HisMajesty&apos;s  Government, who would have to decide whether  to  employ forcein  Persian Territory (paragraphs 18 and 19).    (6) The question of  how far the existing defence scheme,  with some modification, is applicable  to a  deterioration  of the existing situation isbeing investigated  (paragraphs 19 and 20).Military A ggression by the Persian Government.    (7) In the event of overt action by the Persian Government against the oilfields, or a military aggression of any kind, a more serious situation would arise, for which the present defence scheme does not provide (paragraph 21).This  contingency,  including the  possibility of retaliatory  action, is beingconsidered and will form the subject of a later  Report (paragraph 22).Miscellaneoxis.     (8) The attention of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office is invited tothe desirability of forestalling or promptly contradicting false reports, fromwherever they emanate, relating to difficulties in the Persian Gulf, since such reports are liable to scare the employees of  the Anglo-Persian Oil company in  the Gulf and their relations at home, and to encourage the Bolsheviks toegg on the Persian Government  (paragraph 23).

(6) That in his Note he should not mention the possibility of referring thequestion to the Permanent Court of International Justice.    (c) That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should be invited at  once toconsider and report on the question of how far it was possible to provide in thelast resort for the protection of  the  Anglo-Persian  Oil Company&apos;s  property,including the pipe-lines, by military means; that is to say, whether by local and direct action or by  retaliation elsewhere or by both.    (d) That, in the event of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee recommending the movement of men-of-war in the Persian Gulf or any other action of that kind to impress the Persians with the seriousness  of  the situation, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should have authority to sanction it, if he deemed itwise and appropriate, without reference to the Cabinet.         ^                       ^                      ^          ^o
