THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  i- J O                 Printed for the Cabinet. December 1932.CONFIDENTIAL.                                                   ^OP,  431  (32).CABINET.DISCUSSIONS ON MANCHURIA AT GENEVA.    1.   MY Cabinet memorandum CP. 404 (32) of the 19th November was anattempt to forecast the probable course of discussions at the League of Nationsabout the Report of the Lytton Commission.  If my colleagues will re-read that paper, they will find that matters have proceeded very much along the lines thereindicated.  After four days spent by the Council of the League in consideringthe Report, or, rather, in listening to contradictory speeches from the Chinese and Japanese  representatives about the subject, the discussion was transferredvia the  Committee of Nineteen to  the  Assembly.   The debate in the Assemblylasted for four days; it began, and ended, by a pair of challenging statements byChina and Japan,  and the rest of the time was occupied by the observations ofother  Powers.  Following the suggestion  approved by  the Cabinet (64 (32),conclusion 4), I left others to take part in the debate and avoided taking a lead,but on the first two days many of the speeches made by the smaller Powers were so universally hostile to Japan, and so one-sided in their references to the LyttonReport,  that the Great Powers had to intervene. France spoke first of these, andthe line taken  was really the same as that of Italy, Germany and Britain.  But,as seems always to happen at Geneva, the British speech was the only one whichattracted much attention.  I thought it necessary  to point out that the LyttonReport  did  not excuse  China  from blame, but,  on the contrary,  described a situation which had aggravated, even if it had not brought about, the Manchuriany y^cthadStrouble.  Japan&apos;s action was not in accordance with the Oowiiaul&apos; of the League, *but I did not consider that it could be fairly judged unless proper emphasis was laid on those passages in the Report which criticised China.    2.  This intervention had a double effect.  It undoubtedly steadied the toneof the debate and relieved tension which was near to breaking-point.  On the otherhand, it inevitably provoked criticism, and even resentment, from those who hadbeen espousing the cause of China up to the point of condemning Japan out of hand.  The Chinese delegation are great propagandists, and it is noticeable thatthe criticisms in the London newspapers, which are hostile to the Government, are obviously  derived, in every detail, from the same  source.   It was, of course,impossible for the British delegation to  avoid speaking,  and I consider that itwas necessary, especially in view of ultimate possibilities, to take this correctiveline.  At the same time I emphasised our determination to act as loyal membersof the League, and I privately told both  the Japanese and the Chinese that our effort to promote conciliation must not be misinterpreted as indicating that wewould be prepared to disregard as unimportant the breaches of the Covenant that had taken place.    3.  After much private manoeuvring,  it was  arranged that the assembly should transfer the whole matter to the Committee of Nineteen, who will  in due course prepare a Resolution  which will  be put before the  Assembly and votedupon there.  The real difficulties now begin.  It is probable that the Committeeof Nineteen can be induced to regard their  first function as that of promoting asettlement, but, if  accommodation between China and Japan cannot be reached,the time is not distant when the Committee of Nineteen and the Assembly itself      6644   [7977J
will want to proceed to judgment.  And after judgment comes execution, whichwould bring up the alarming subject of sanctions and Article 16.    4.   The Committee of Nineteen is likely to favour the suggestion made inmy speech that  the  United  States  and Soviet Russia  should  be. invited tocontribute a member each to that body for the purpose of its efforts to promote asettlement by conciliation.  I have urged the Japanese Government to  assent tothis course, and the American representative here indicates that the United StatesGovernment might also be willing.  It is much better to make America share theresponsibility than to leave her as an outside critic of the efforts of others, and american help  would be  valuable.  As  for  Soviet  Russia,  M. Litvinov  hasunexpectedly arrived at Geneva for what purpose is not yet known.  Apart fromthis, I anticipate that the Committee of Nineteen will want to recommend (1) theacceptance of the Lytton Report, or  at any  rate the first eight chapters of it,which consist of conclusions of fact; and (2) some reference to the Resolution ofthe League of March last that it is &quot;  incumbent upon members of the League ofNations not to recognise any situajjon^treaty or agreement which may be broughtabout by means contrary to the ^z&amp;se&amp;at of the League of  Nations or to the pact of Paris.&quot;  It  would be impossible to deny this  abstract proposition,  but, as I pointed out in paragraph 6 of my previous paper, the real difficulty will arise ifit is attempted to apply  it in concrete terms to &quot;recognition,&quot; in the  technicalsense of  the State of Manchukuo.   The Americans have already been enquiringas to our attitude about  this,  and I have replied by saying that the question of diplomatic recognition is  purely  academic, since the State  of Manchukuo inpresent circumstances is not one which we should in any case  regard as qualified for such recognition.   But  if this matter is pressed by the majority to  the point when a declaration has to be made, I must then say that I could not bind the handsof my successors for an indefinite future on a question which must be determinedby practical considerations as a matter of executive judgment at the time.     5.   I cannot formulate questions for the Cabinet to answer at the moment,though I shall be grateful for any advice and guidance. But I am more and moreimpressed with the feeling  that the Manchurian question is going to give us, both at Geneva and  at home, a great deal of trouble before it is disposed of.                                                                    J.  S.Geneva, December 11, 1932.
