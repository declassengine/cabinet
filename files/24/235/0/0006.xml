IN  the conclusions  to  our Interim Report  (CP. 307  (32)) which  wepresented to the Cabinet on the 24th October, 1932, it was stated that we proposedwithin our terms of reference  to examine the  possibilities presented by smallholdings and land  settlement as a means of ameliorating  the unemployment situation.    2.   In approaching this problem we wish to emphasise several  new factors and considerations which have led us to believe that land settlement, planned onbold lines, wall make a real contribution to the solution of our present difficulties.    3.   These new considerations are as follows :          Until quite recently mass unemployment in  this country was currently    believed to be a passing phase.  To-day it is generally accepted that, even    after a world recovery, we shall have a large permanent core of unemployed.    particularly in the neighbourhood of our derelict heavy industries.    The    Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his speech in the House on the 8th November,    called special attention to this new aspect of the problem.    4.   To  quote the  words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, there are  &apos;&apos; alarge number a million or more of persons for whom we cannot expect to findregular employment in their own trades either  this  winter or  next winter, or,perhaps, for many winters  to  come &quot;; it follows that, unless  something more constructive is done, public funds will have to go on pouring out year by year, inbenefit or relief of one sort or another, upwards of  60,000,000 a year nearly one-third of the total pre-war budget without the provision of a single productiveasset, but with increasing physical and moral deterioration in the men themselves^    5.   Allowing for the effect of the Anomalies Regulations, the increase in maleunemployment during the past year (over 300,000) has coincided with a decreaseof over 100,000 in the  case of females.  If there is any substantial change-over from the primary industries, in which men are mainly employed, to the secondary industries, which are largely women&apos;s industries, an  already difficult problem of male unemployment may easily become acute.    6.   We are agreed that unemployment relief works are  no remedy.    Theexperience of recent years has shown that, after the expenditure of  hundreds ofmillions of pounds on such works, not only does the total of unemployment remainpractically  unaffected,  but  the problem may  even  be  aggravated by  the accumulation of heavy national and local debt charges. Moreover, it is recognisedthat relief works provided only temporary employment at a cost many times thatof unemployment benefit.     We would stress the fact that land settlement has nothing in common withthis policy in that it provides permanent employment.
2    7.  Fortunately, within the last year there has been a complete change ofnational policy in regard to agriculture.  The fiscal changes already in force whencombined with other measures now in contemplation  are expected to secure forthe cultivator of the land (particularly for the small cultivator) a reasonable levelof prices for his products.  The question then of small, holdings and land settle-ment must be reviewed in the light of this change.  Moreover, the recent debates on unemployment in  the House of Commons have  shown  that all  parties areprepared to support a really national effort intended to redress the balance betweenagriculture and  industry.    8.  The change in national policy  in respect of agriculture should,  in anycase, stem the  drift from the country to the town, and cause the re-employment ofthe increasingly  high proportion of agricultural  labourers now out of work.    9.  But this alone is not enough.  Considering together the new aspect ofunemployment and the new outlook on agriculture, we  are impressed  with  theevidence that in distressed  areas adjoining derelict coalfields and along  thenorth-east coast  a big proportion of the unemployed men were either themselvesformerly engaged in agricultural pursuits of one kind or another, or are of the type of men that will  provide the best settlers on the land.    10.  We are therefore convinced that expenditure of public money on care-fully  planned schemes  of  land settlement  can be demonstrably  justified as  a constructive contribution to  the national emergency, which will  create  capitalassets retaining  permanent value long after the money has been spent.    11.  We have in Part I of this report  examined the existing arrangementsfor the provision of  small holdings for the ordinary applicant possessing thenecessary capital to cultivate a holding, and in Part II we have considered theprovision of small holdings for special purposes  for unemployed persons, agricul-tural labourers  and ex-service men who have been  trained  in agriculture :  themajority of whom will not  possess the necessary working capital.                                  PART I.  The Provision of Small Holdings for the Ordinary Applicant Possessing the                  Necessary Capital to Cultivate a Holding.England and Wales.    12.  Briefly the Small Holdings  and Allotments Acts, 1908 to 1926,  impose on the Councils of Counties and the Councils of County Boroughs the duty of meeting the demand for small holdings if it is possible to provide them without incurring a loss, and also empower Councils, with the approval of the Ministry,*to provide holdings notwithstanding  that a loss  may be incurred.  In  that casethe Ministry may  contribute up to  a  maximum of 75 per cent, of the loss whichit is estimated will be incurred in each year.    13.  For various reasons, mainly because of the liability for 25  per  cent.of any annual deficiency, Councils,  speaking generally, have not been very active in the exercise of their powers under the Act of 1926, the total area of  new land aquired or proposed to be  acquired  during the  five years 1927-31 being 27.500acres, providing 960 holdings, a yearly average  of 5,500 acres.  In consequenceof the national crisis in  August 1931, and the steps taken by the Government bycircular letter to restrict expenditure by  local authorities as far as possible, thearea of fresh land acquired by Councils during the past twelve months has been less than this average.   It is true that Councils were informed by the ministry on the 21st September, 1931, that  they could continue to submit proposals, butonly a few schemes have been submitted during the past twelve months, the totalarea comprised therein  being about 2,100 acres, to provide some 100 holdings.    14.  We feel  that  the  financial  basis of this scheme has  probably led to acertain extravagance in the equipment of holdings and has given little inducement to County Councils to press for the  full economic rent of the holdings created.       * In this Report the Ministry means the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
A  basis of grant which made the County Councils more interested in reducingthe annual deficiency  or the direct provision of holdings by the Central Govern-ment as is practised in Scotland would, in our opinion, make possible considerableeconomies.    15.  The  Agricultural Land (Utilisation)  Act, 1931, gives the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries power to act  in default of  County Councils who havenot provided sufficient small holdings, but in existing circumstances the exerciseof these powers has not been contemplated.    16.  Demand. The following  table shows  the  position as  regards the outstanding  demand  for  small  holdings  (Councils)  at the end  of the  last five years: -	Approved Applicants awaiting Holdings.

The present agricultural  depression is doubtless having  its effect onthe demand for small holdings, but we are informed that, apart from a few areasin England where  the holdings are predominantly arable, suitable  applicantsare forthcoming for any good holding that is known to be vacant.  Many potentialsmall holders prefer to wait until a particular holding suitable for their require-ments is vacant before they make an application and then confine their applicationto that particular holding.  Such men  are not included in the  general lists of applicants on which the returns  made  by Councils  in England and Wales are based, which returns to this extent understate the real demand.    18.  In Scotland we are informed that when a new small holding scheme isprojected the list of applicants is invariably increased by well qualified personswho had  not previously made application.    19.  Owing to the falling  prices of agricultural produce, there is no doubtthat the applicants have not been very insistent, but when a revival in agriculture is experienced, with better prices for small holders&apos; crops and other agricultural produce,  it may well be that the existing approved applicants will press for their demands to be satisfied and new applicants will be forthcoming.    20.  Cost and Annual Deficiency of  Holdings. Under the  Small holdings and Allotments Act, 1926,  the average capital cost of  new holdings providedby  Councils,  a proportion of which are part-time holdings and some of whichare not fully equipped, has been  1,325 10s.  The annual loss in the first normalyear per holding has been  30 9s. 4(7., of which the Ministry&apos;s contribution (whichmust  not exceed 75  per cent.) has  been  22 16s. 8d.  As  short-dated loans for equipment, &amp;c, fall in, the Ministry&apos;s contribution is lessened.    21.  It  is important to  remember  that small holdings  provided  by  a council range from a bare land holding of just over an acre of land to a 50-acreholding equipped with house and buildings.  The capital cost of a dairy holding in a milk-producing county might amount to  2,300, made up of  40 acres at 30 per  acre,   1,200;  brick and  tile  or slate house  of the type  regarded as necessary for a holding of the kind,  500; buildings,  600.    22.  It will be  realised that the greater the proportion of fully-equippedholdings  provided  (equipped with house, buildings, &amp;c), as compared&apos; with bareland holdings,  the greater the  capital cost, and, generally speaking, the largerthe annual deficiency, inasmuch as the  return received in the shape of rent for expenditure on equipment falls  short of  the loan charges on such  cost.
    &apos;2&apos;S.  Possible Result of Economies in Cost of Equipment. As a result of theissue of the Circular Letter by the Ministry on the 21st September, 1931, whichemphasised the necessity of restricting to the lowest practicable figure the capitalexpenditure on holdings, some  County Councils  have been induced to reconsiderschemes for the provision of small holdings and have adopted a more economicalstandard  for  equipment.  There is  no  reason  why this policy should not becontinued and extended, in which case the Ministry is of opinion that, assuming the proportion of bare land holdings remained as in the past, the average capital cost per holding could be brought down to  1,100.    24.  Capital Charges and Return on Expenditure. Loans for small holdingspurposes are obtainable from the Public Works  Loan Commissioners.  The rateof interest has just been reduced from 4-^ per cent, to 4 per cent.  Examinationof  the large  majority  of  non-self-supporting  schemes  carried out  under theAct of 1926 shows that the estimated net rents (excluding loan  charges from consideration) have averaged  3 per  cent, on the capital expenditure, these netrents being available towards the payment of loan charges.  Of a total expenditureof  1,325,000 in respect of land purchased since  1926 approximately  257,000was borrowed at an interest rate of 5^ per cent.;   584,000 at 5 per cent;  20,000at 41 per cent.;  378,000 at 4f per cent, and   86,000 at 4  per cent.    25.  It is, we think,  noteworthy  that  even  though,  as we  have already indicated, some features of the 1926 Act scheme may have  tended to encourageextravagance in the past, the return  on capital invested in the shape of net rentshas averaged 3 per cent.   Such deficiency as there has been on Council schemes hasbeen due to the net rents being insufficient to meet loan charges based on ratesof interest ranging from 5\ per cent, downwards.    26.  Statistics  of  Statutory  Small Holdings. -The following tables givesparticulars in a summarised form of the area of land held by Councils in Englandand Wales for the purpose of small holdings at various dates :  			Sold to Small Holders.

In addition to the above area of 25,724 acres, the Ministry has approved schemes comprising a further 2,961 acres to provide an additional 123 holdings,which will make a total of 28,685 acres acquired under the Act of 1926, to provide1,042 holdings.Scotland.    28.  In  Scotland local  authorities have no  statutory duties in connectionwith land settlement  and  the  Department of  Agriculture for Scotland are-directly  responsible for  the provision  of holdings. for  qualified applicants.The Department have, in fact, formed numbers of holdings of the type and sizecontemplated in Part II of this Report.  The average cost per holding is greaterthan the amount estimated  by the Ministry of Agriculture  and Fisheries to benecessary in England.  This is due mainly to the cost of buildings.  The standardadopted  as the result of experience is considered to be the  minimum that willmeet the requirements  of Scottish conditions, keeping also in mind the questionof future maintenance.
    29.   Apart  from  the  necessary roads, water  supplies and fencing,  eachholding (poultry and market garden) is equipped with  a dwelling-house built ofbrickwork (three bedrooms, kitchen, scullery,  &amp;c), and a  brick shell  steading.The average costs of dwelling-house and steading are  450 and  150 respectively.The  cost of land varies with locality as also does the  cost  of  roads, water supplies, &amp;c.  For example, in cases where a country water  main is available thecost of water supply works is much reduced, but the land normally costs more toacquire.  The following statement shows average costs of schemes carried out bythe Department: 5-Acre Holdings.	Land.	Buildings, House and Steading.	Roads, Water, Fencing, &amp;c.	Total Initial Cost.

The figure in Column (6) is arrived at by an actuarial valuation of allpayments and receipts on the system adopted by the Committee on Land Settle-meni  in Scotland  presided over by Sir Gordon  Nairne (192S).   The actualincidence of  the annual cost to the taxpayer would of course  depend upon themethod of financing the proposed operations.    31.  The applicants settled by the Department are required to be qualified inknowledge, experience and capital.   The amount of capital  considered to benecessary varies with the knowledge and experience of the applicant, but it  isconsidered that it would be practicable to start a reasonably efficient man on apoultry holding with working capital of  200 and  on  a Market Garden holdingwith  150- 200.   If the working capital was reduced to these figures, part of the earnings of  the holding  in  the  earlier years would be  required  to build upstock, &amp;c.    32.  Effect on unemployment of provision of small holdings for the ordinaryapplicant. Persons coming within the ordinary description of  unemployed,rarely figure  amongst the applicants under these schemes as, in order to secure a holding, they must not only possess the necessary knowledge and experience to run it, but they must also possess the whole of the working capital necessary fora holding.  Land settlement,  conducted on existing lines, would not, therefore,directly affect the  question of unemployment, except to the extent that vacancies in employment would be created as a result of settling applicants, and in so far as temporary employment was provided in connection with the work of the equip-rment  of the small holding created.                                 PART II.Provision of Small Holdings for Unemployed Persons, Agricultural Labourers,         and Ex-Sennce Men who have been Trained in A griculture.    33.  While the existing schemes are useful and  should in our opinion becontinued, their effectiveness is limited, in that  those taking advantage of themmust be possessed of the necessary capital for working a holding.  For this reasontheir effect on unemployment is only indirect.   We have accordingly turned our attention to consideration of the possibility of settling on the land unemployed persons, agricultural labourers, &amp;c, who are not in possession of capital resources.    34.  The question is whether a practicable scheme of land settlement forsuch persons can be worked out.  In this connection we would point out that -    (1) small holders have on the whole weathered the economic depression better          than other agriculturists  (see extract from Ministry&apos;s Land Division          Report for 1931 attached as Appendix I);
     (2) while in the depressed areas there are a large number of workers definitely           surplus to the requirements of  their industries,* it is  known  that           among these communities  there  are  to be found many persons  who-           were in agricultural occupations up to the period of  the war;  whilst           in the last eleven years 172,000 have left the land, many of whom are           presumably  helping to swell the numbers of the unemployed  in the           towns.  There are also a considerable number of agricultural labourers           unemployed,  especially in  the winter, who, though not in receipt of           unemployment benefit, are being supported out of the rates;     (3) experience shows that  selected urban dwellers have been as successful as.           agricultural workers on  small  holdings.  An analysis of figures for           Scotland shows  that of  3,965 new holdings created  only  3,000 were           taken up by agriculturists and fishermen,  the  remaining thousand           being occupied  by  men from various  industrial  and commercial           occupations.   Comprehensive  figures are not available for  England           and Wales,  but we are  informed that of 145 men settled on small           holdings in  Lancashire,  only 56 were from agricultural occupations,           the remaining  89 having  previously  carried on a  wide variety  of           urban trades.  We understand that experience in the Dominions tends           to the same conclusion.     35.  Under the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)  Act, 1931. power is given tothe Minister to provide  small holdings with financial assistance for unemployed persons,  agricultural labourers  and ex-service men  who have  been  trained  inagriculture.   Under that Act it was contemplated that  training facilities wouldbe provided, if  necessary, for selected unemployed,  including  wives, that  land would be acquired,  sub-divided and equipped by the State as small holdings, thattenants would be provided with capital on loan, receive an allowance in lieu ofunemployment  benefit during  their first  few months  on  the  holding,  and  beprovided with local expert supervision so far and as  long as might be necessary.Having regard, however, to the paramount necessity for economy in regard to expenditure, the Government decided in  September 1931 that  it would  not  bepossible at present  to ask Parliament  to vote any money for these purposes, andthis decision has since been confirmed by the present Government.     36.  If it were decided now to reverse this policy  and to exercise these powers,the type of holding to be provided requires to be considered.  The figures givenin paragraph 21  as to the cost of a fully equipped small holding devoted to theproduction  of  milk  give an  idea  of the comparatively high cost which theprovision  of an ordinary equipped  small  holding would entail.  .Moreover, theamount of working capital required, which may amount to  15  an acre, rendersa holding of 30 to 50 acres expensive to contemplate in connection with the settle-ment of unemployed persons.  We  attach importance, however, to the inclusion in land settlement schemes, where possible, of a certain proportion of agricultural workers  and  ex-service men who have had  a  suitable course  of  training  inagriculture (e.g., at Chisledon).     37.  Apart from the question of capital cost, the fall in the prices obtainableat present for what may be described as ordinary agricultural produce appearsto indicate that a more desirable  course,  so far as  unemployed  persons areconcerned, is to consider the establishment of holdings devoted primarily  to aspecialised form  of production,  such  as poultry-keeping and market-gardening.     38.  With regard to poultry holdings,  it should be possible for an assuredmarket to  be obtained through the  medium of the National Mark organisation for  the marketing of eggs.   This  would not rule  out the possibility of saleotherwise,  e.g., to retail customers, but the estimate of the purchase price of the    * The five surveys of depressed ureas made at the request of the late President of the Boardof Trade which have recently been  published suggest that, after  making all allowance for anyprobable improvement in trade,  there  are workers surplus to the  requirements of industriesdistributed as follows:             Mersey Side ...      ...      ...   .   ...      ...     ...     25,000           Lancashire (excluding Mersey Side)    ...      ...     ...    160,000           North-East Coast    ...    &apos;  ...      ...      ...     ...     64,000           South-West ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     ...     30,000           South-West Scotland ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    100,000
land (see paragraph 47) is based on  the acquisition  of  land  which may not be close to a local market.    39.  With regard to the provision of  market garden holdings, a review ofthe position  reveals the fact  that, as a result of the low prices received for cereals, many farmers have turned their attention to the production of vegetables,such as brussels sprouts, cabbages,  peas, &amp;c, which  they sell in public marketsat j)rices with which the small holder could not compete.  On the other hand,there are districts in England and Wales where the local production of vegetablesis deficient in relation to local  requirements, and it is believed  that it would bepossible to  establish a  limited  number of market  garden  holdings in  these districts.    40.  The question as to  whether  the  expansion of the  vegetable canningindustry would permit of the establishment of a larger number of small marketgarden holdings has been considered.  It is  understood, however, that the canningfactories prefer to make contracts for comparatively large areas  in  individualoccupation,  thus facilitating the handling of the produce, and  it is doubtfulwhether it  would  be  possible to establish small market garden holdings the produce from which would be taken  by factories.   On the other hand,  as thedemands of canning factories increase, the activities of the larger farmer may be diverted from ordinary vegetables, thus giving a better opportunity for the smallmarket gardener.     41.  The effect of the Import Duties has also been  considered.  While it istrue that imports of plums, cherries and pears have been reduced considerably,the fact that the capital cost of planting and bringing the trees to fruiting stageis as high as  60 an acre, and that no return can be expected  until the fifth orsixth year, renders this form of cultivation unsuitable for the holdings proposed.Similarly as regards currants, gooseberries and strawberries,  it would  take atleast two years for a grower to secure any return from his capital.     42. As regards tomatoes, cucumbers and early salads,  these constitute  atype of glass-house and frame production where the initial capital cost would be high.   The capital required for the production of asparagus  is also high, while no return can be expected for at least three years.  There is room for  expansionas regards onions and broccoli, but the latter can only be produced in a  few ofthe southern countries at a similar period to the imported.     43. For the foregoing  reasons, therefore, it might be desirable  to  confine the pi*provision of market garden holdings, at any rate in the first instance, to the localities where the local production of vegetables is deficient.     44. The details of the working capital required, the method of stocking and working, and the return which the tenants might earn from holdings of the kindsindicated have been worked out, and, provided the tenant possessed the necessaryworking capital, or was provided on loan  with such  part of the working  capitalas he did  not possess, it is believed  that  the tenant would  be able  to  make  areasonable living from the holding.     45.  The types of holding intended to provide full-time  occupation whichhave been under consideration are        (i) Holdings  not  exceeding 5  acres  for  poultry-keeping  with  house           (incorporating packing room and food store).      (ii) Holdings not exceeding 5 acres  for market gardening with  house and           buildings.     46.  By reducing the standard of housing accommodation to the minimumconsistent with reasonable comfort, a substantial economy in  capital expenditure could be secured.   A bungalow of the type shown in elevation  and plan anddescribed in the short specification attached to this report (Appendix II) would doubtless be suitable for the purpose.  The cost of such a dwelling house, at prices current to-day, is estimated at  300, to which must be added the cost of any road- making, fencing, water supply or exceptional drainage work.  It would be equally suitable for either a poultry or a market garden holding except that in the latter case the packing room and store could be dispensed with at a  saving of (say)  20, but it would be necessary to provide on the market garden holdings a small range
of buildings to cost an additional  100.  If more than twenty houses were erectedat one  time  on a particular area  of  land,  some saving  in capital  cost  might reasonably be expected.    47.  The  average cost of holdings  in  England and  Wales  of the typesindicated above may work out as follows :      (i)  Poultry holding of 5 acres with dwelling house                                                                              Capital cost of land  ...       ...       ...       ...    100           Capital cost of house ...       ...       ...       ...    300           Capital cost of fencing, water supply,  road and               path  making (say)       ...       ...       ...    100                      Total     ...       .......       ...    500    (NOTE. As regards the cost of the land; if the holdings were established in isolated districts..eg., certain  parts of East Anglia, Wilts and Hants, it might  be possible to purchase land at as-low a figure  as  10 per acre, but probably  20 an acre would be  a safer figure to adopt as anaverage.  Cheapness of land may, of course, be offset by absence of water or adequate approaches.by existing roads.)    (ii)  Market Garden Holdings of 5 acres with dwelling house                                                                              Capital cost  of land,  including fencing,   water    supply, road and path making    ...       ...    350Capital cost of house ...       ...       ...       ...    280Capital cost of buildings     ...       ...       ...    100           Total     ...       ...       ...       ...    730    (XOTK. As regards the cost of the land, market gardening can only be carried on successfullyon suitable land which usually commands a good price.  To ensure success, these holdings shouldbe near a centre of population for marketing reasons, and frontage to a good road  is desirable.)    48.  No special provision has been made for payments which will have to bemade as compensation to outgoing tenants on the acquisition of land.    Everyeffort should be made to acquire land  with vacant possession, in which  casecompensation for disturbance of the existing tenant, which might be a substantialsum, would be  avoided.   Payments may, however, have  to be made to outgoingtenants for improvements and tenant  right, which  will  not be recoverable fromthe incoming small holder out of his working capital, but as  a rule it should bepossible to meet such payments out of the amount estimated for the capital costof the land.    49.  The following table shows as  regards the two classes of  holding the gross rent  which should be obtained for  the holding, and net rent after allowing for the ordinary deductions, maintenance, &amp;c.

Eor the purpose of illustration, a possible scheme for sub-division andequipment as poultry holdings has been evolved in the case of a block of land atpresent in the  ownership  of the Ministry at Amesbury, Wiltshire.   Particularswill be found in Appendix III to this Report, together with a plan showing thelayout adopted.  We also add  as Appendix IV an outline of a scheme for the-
 conversion into poultry holdings by trainee  labour, of farms  at Claydon and Brandon now in the possession of the Ministry of Labour.  The  disposal of these farms is in any event contemplated, and we wish to recommend the adoption of this scheme as the most profitable method of achieving this object.     51.  Additional Factors to be taken into  account in the case of  Unemploijed Persons, Agricultural Labourers and,  Ex-Service Men  who have  been  trained in Agriculture. The figures in paragraph 49 give the capital cost and the return likely to  be received on the provision- of holdings  if let  to  normal  tenants possessing all the necessary working capital and experience.  While it is believed that  there  is a  considerable number  of unemployed  persons  who  would  be applicants for holdings, and who already keep poultry or are cultivating allot- ments successfully,  yet if such  persons are  provided with  holdings  these  are further factors to be taken  into  account.     52.  Risk of  Abnormal  Losses. In  the  case  of County Council  small holding schemes, the margin  for contingencies adopted for the basis of  State contributions is usually put at 1\ per cent, of the gross rents.  In preparing the estimates for the purpose of consideration of  the present scheme, the small type of holding and the  one type character  of  the undertaking appeared to make it desirable to increase this margin for contingencies to 10 per cent.  Failures of tenants above the normal would depend upon many factors, particularly the care with which the selection  of families for settlement is made and the  degree of supervision provided in the first two years.   Moreover, it would be  unwise to ignore other considerations, such as the fact  that the men will be,  to a certain extent, inexperienced, in the management of an agricultural undertaking and will not  have  invested  their own  capital in the  undertaking, but  it is difficult to express these additional risks in terms of percentage  of rent.     53.  Cost of Local Expert Supervision. It should further  be observed that the  cost of management allowed for is 5  per cent,  of the  rental.  It  may be assumed that it will be necessary to provide for expert local supervision of the general operations  of inexperienced small  holders at least during the first  two years and the  cost of such supervision would be in addition to the expenses allowed  for.  During  this period the annual cost  of  this  supervisory and administrative staff for 60  contiguous  small holders may  be estimated at   600. It would  doubtless be  desirable  to carry out the  purchasing  and marketing- arrangements centrally, and  additional staff  and expense  would be  thereby incurred, but this would have to be borne by the product.     54.  Cost  of  Transport. It  would  be   necessary to  meet the costs  of transporting the settler and his  family from  his old home to the holding.   We have adopted for an estimate in this connection the average cost of removing a family under the Ministrv of Labour&apos;s Household Removals Scheme, namely,  14  5s.     55.  Working   Capital. The  working capital   required  in  the case  of poultry holdings for stock, fowl houses and  equipment  obviously  depends  on the  amount  of laying  stock which is provided by  or for  the tenant at  the commencement of  his occupation.  It  is believed  that a sum not  exceeding  350 should ordinarily  be  sufficient to enable a  man to earn approximately 30,s.  to  2  a  week on the average during  the  first two years while  building up sufficient stock to enable him to continue to earn a reasonable living subsequently. The  provision of this maximum amount should make it possible to reduce theamount of  the maintenance  allowance referred to later.     56.  It may be noted that the Department of Agriculture for  Scotland inthe early  part of this  year carried out a brief survey of  specialised  poultryfarming.   The  accounts  of 29 holdings were examined,  and  the  investigatorreported that &quot; the average labour income per person was  155, which is probablyabove the  average   return on  specialised poultry holdings for the  whole  ofScotland.&quot;  If account is taken of the necessity to reserve part of the earnings ofthe holding to build up stock, &amp;c, the  above  figure is not  inconsistent with theconclusion  of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as to the approximateearnings of the holders in the earlier years of settlement.
     57.  The working  capital required as regards the two  types of holdingsmentioned may therefore be taken as :                                                                             (i)  Working capital  (including birds and neces-                 sary housing, runs, &amp;c.)       ...       ...     350           (ii)  Working capital         ...      ...       ...     170The figure as regards (i) assumes that the tenant will devote the first three monthsof his occupation of the holding to making his poultry houses, erecting wirefencing, &amp;c., under supervision.     58.  If  the  prospective tenant did not possess  the  capital to work  the holding, it would be necessary to contemplate its provision.   The loan of working capital would presumably be made  on  the basis of payment of interest (afterthe  first  year) and repayment of the  sum  advanced over a period of years.Although for the jDurposes of this memorandum the working capital is expressedin terms of money, it  would certainly be  preferable in  practice  to  advanceworking capital not in cash but supply it  to the  tenants in kind in the form of stock, implements, seeds, fertilisers, &amp;c.   It is difficult to make any close estimateof the loss which might be incurred in  this connection.  Careful selection and supervision  of  the  tenants in the earlier  stages  would decrease the  risks, but,having regard to  the  experimental  nature of  the  scheme,  the likelihood of loss  under this heading must be  contemplated.  In this connection it should beremembered that an obligation to repay working  capital during the first fewyears of business is a burden not  usually borne by small holders.     59.  Maintenance Alloivance. It would also be necessary to make provisionfor the maintenance of the small holder in the initial stages of his occupationof the holding if he had no other resources.  The Agricultural Land (Utilisation)Act, 1931, contemplated an allowance &quot;not exceeding   50 in  the aggregate and30s.  in any week during the first year of occupation, the amount of the allowance to be proportionately reduced having regard to  the value of the benefit Avhichthe  man might reasonably be expected  to  derive  from the holding.&quot;    As a corollary to the  payment of such  allowance the man would  cease to  drawUnemployment Benefit or Transitional  Payments.   Financial Estimates respecting the Establishment of 1,000 Holdings in                            England and  Wales.    60.  For the purpose of the preparation of a summary, of expenditure wehave assumed the establishment of 1.000 holdings in England and Wales, suchas are described in this Report, in the following proportions:              Poultry holdings         ...      ...       ...     800             Market garden holdings  ...      ...       ...     200the men not requiring training.    61.  We are informed  by  the Treasury that, following the decision of  thepresent Government, all such expenditure must be met  out of  current revenue,and on this basis the following table  gives the estimated cost  and receipts  forthe two financial years 1933 and 1934 :

These figures are based on the assumptions that     (1) it will be possible to adhere to the capital standards proposed  (which are lower than have         previously existed under schemes carried out by  local  authorities) in  the  face  of         Parliamentary pressure  for higher  standards  (especially  for employed  agricultural         labourers and ex-Service men)  and    (2) net rents of 3 per  cent,  will be obtainable at the present  time of low prices and in         addition to interest and sinking fund on working capital.    The net cost will, of course, be materially increased if these assumptions prove to be unsound.    This Table  makes  no provision for training costs, which would  normally amount to  7,000-per 100 persons + administrative expenses (see paragraph 78).     62.   We feel,  however,  that any  decision  as to financing  expenditure  on.unemployment out of revenue cannot reasonably be made applicable to a schemeof land settlement.   Settlement through County Councils in England and Wales,involving the purchase of land and the erection  of dwelling houses, is at presentcarried out on a loan basis, and while it is true that under the post-war scheme(Land  Settlement  (Facilities) Act, 1919)  the amount  required  for  capitalexpenditure was in  the  first  instance provided  by the Treasury out  of revenue,the money was advanced by the Public Works Loan Board to the County Councilson  loan.   It  must  be borne  in mind that land settlement is permanent  work,which will permanently remove  the unemployed  man from the field of publicmaintenance, and, in the event of his vacating his holding, it will remain availablefor another tenant.   Moreover, the annual return in the form of rents for theholdings  represents a permanent  annual revenue.   The  provision of  working capital for tenants of the holdings is undoubtedly a more speculative undertaking.But we have felt justified, judging from past experience and assuming  the greateramount of supervision  to which the proposed settlers would be subjected, intaking an overall loss of 10  per  cent, (in the case of the poultry holdings over50 per cent, of the working capital will be in the form of poultry houses, wire,&amp;c. 10 per cent, of the total figure therefore means over 20 per cent, on live-stock).   We are therefore of opinion that any future scheme of land settlement should be  financed by way of loan.     63.   We are fully alive  to the objection  to  a  proposal that the  Government,through the Ministry of Agriculture, should increase and accelerate the presentmoderate expenditure so far as Land Settlement  is concerned, but,  nevertheless.we think  that  the  proposal  is desirable.  In our view there  would  be positiveadvantages in  removing the administration  of the new settlement policy fromthe necessarily limited sphere of a Government Department and also from thatof politics.  We feel that the institution of an  ad hoc body (referred to later as&quot;the  Commission&quot;)  on  the  lines of a Public. Utility Company or the  central electricity Board would, not only  meet the  particular difficulty about reversingeconomy  decisions,  but  also,  because of its  greater  freedom of action, wouldprovide a more effective and more  permanent basis  for the  scheme.
     64.  We  recommend that the  Commission should either be supplied  with capital by the State, winch would borrow for the purpose, or should raise capital in the market with State guarantee.  In  either case new legislation would be required.     65.  Pending any arrangements for the formation of the Commission which we propose, we recommend  that authority should be given to the Ministry of Agriculture and  Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland to proceed with  an  experimental scheme for the provision of 1,000 holdings.  If and when the Commission is set up, we are of the opinion that it should aim at a minimum five-year programme of 1,000 holdings  in  its first year and 2,500 holdings in each  of the four subsequent years.     66.  We are informed by the Treasury that it would not be safe to assume that  the  Commission could now  obtain money  under either of  the  above alternatives at a  lower rate  than 4 per cent.,  and the estimates below have been prepared on that basis.     67.  As  against  the liability  assumed,  the State would have as  security national  assets  represented by  the land,  houses and  other  property of the Commission,  subject  to  any prior  charges.   We assume that the Commission would be required to  make provision for repayment by means of a sinking  fund over 80 years  for land and 40 years for buildings.   (These are the periods for which County Councils can at present borrow  for similar purposes.)     68.  As regards the money borrowed for the purpose of advance of working capital for the tenants, the period  of loan must necessarily have regard to the purpose of the advances, and we  are advised that an average period could not be taken in excess of twelve years.   We anticipate that although the tenants should be required, and should be in a position to pay interest on the amount advanced during the first two years,  they would  not be able to commence repayment  of capital by instalments until the third year of their occupation.  This would mean that the Commission  would borrow on a twelve years&apos; basis, and, after the first two years obtain  repayment, from the  tenants on a ten years&apos;  basis.  We  have already indicated our view that it would be prudent to anticipate an overall loss of 10 per cent, on the advance of working capital, which it would  be necessary for  the State to meet.   The  remainder of  the capital advanced  to  tenants would be repayable in instalments over ten years, though further advances will be required on changes of tenancy.     69.   If these proposals were adopted  the financial details of the Commission^ yearly operations in connection with the provision of 1,000 holdings (England and Wales), the men not requiring training, would work out as follows on a loanbasis : I.--Estimate of the average cash payments and receipts of the Commission over                          the first twelve years.PAYMENTS.Provision of holdings   Expenditure on land,  150,000; interest    (4 per cent.) and sinking fund repay-    ment over 80 years ( 4   lid. per    cent.)

Repayment of  capital  with  interest  subsequently on a  10-year  basis  at 12 4s. 8d. per cent.    I In addition, fresh issues of working capital would be required in a proportion of the casesduring the first 12 years and on changes of tenancy thereafter, but no estimate can be given ofthe amount which would be required as the circumstances of each case will vary.
    70.  On this estimate the excess of recurrent payments over receipts wouldaverage  11 per small holder per annum for 12 years, when the working capital would  be repaid : for the following 28 years the excess of payments over receiptswould  average  8 per small holder per annum.  In addition non-recurrent costs would  be incurred as set out below.         II. Non-recurrent Costs (in respect of every 1,000 holdings).    71.  Some of the  initial expenditure incidental to the establishment of thesmall holdings and the settlement of men thereon would not, however, be a propersubject for borrowing, and it will, in our opinion, be necessary for the Govern-ment  to meet expenditure on the following items by way of grant: Maintenanceallowances,   34,000;  Central accommodation,   13,000; Removals,  14,000.    72.  In addition,  the administrative expenses and cost of local supervisionwould have to be met by the State. These are estimated at  12,500 and  10,000respectively during  each of the  first two  years.   In our  view the State  canjustifiably undertake expenditure of this character, in that a saving to public funds may be anticipated in the increase of employment that would result, andin the permanent removal  of the settlers from  the sphere  of UnemploymentInsurance and Public Relief.    73.  These expenses may be summarised as follows :                First Year.                                   Removals ..    .     ......14,000Maintenance allowances ..    ..    ..  34,000Central   accommodation  ^temporary  character)    ..    ..    ..     ..  13,000*Administrative expenses ..    ..    ..  12,500Local supervision ..    ..    ..    ..  10,000 83,500              Second Year.                                    Administrative expenses ..    ..    ..   12,500Local supervision ..    ..    ..    ..   10,0(10 22,500                                                   106,000    74.  The foregoing figures are prepared on the assumption that the settlershave no  available capital or other sources of income. We have also made theassumption that on the land purchased there would be no buildings in the formof cottages,  barns, &amp;c.   With regard to  the question  of capital,  we  believethat experience of the Means  Test shows that there are,  in fact,  a  number ofunemployed men who are in possession of some capital, and it would not only becheaper,  but better, if at least a proportion of the settlers had some personal stake in their working capital.  This would also provide a &quot;cushion &quot; for the securityof the loan of working capital, which would constitute a first charge.  We attachparticular  importance to this  in  the case of the market garden holdings  as a longer period will elapse before full production can be ensured and the tenantsfirmly established.  For these reasons we are  of opinion that, in order to lightenthe burden of repayment of borrowed capital in the case of these holdings, itwould be desirable for the selected tenants to provide some of the working capital.    75.  The estimates visualise the purchase of the land required for settlement,but we  have  reason  to  suppose that Government  Departments  such  as theCommissioners of  Crown Lands and the Forestry Commission, in addition to theMinistry of Labour and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, already own aconsiderable  area of land which might be suitable for  the purpose, some of whichland is  at present in hand.   So far as  this land  can  be made  available for settlement, capital expenditure would be saved as regards the purchase of  land.                 III. Cost of training inexperienced persons.     76.  We anticipate that at the inception of the scheme sufficient experiencedmen will  be  found  to  render special training unnecessary,  apart from the supervision which will be exercised during  the first two years of the tenancies.As, however, it may be necessary to provide  at a later stage for the settlement of    * A return  of  050 a year will be received from the  small holders  on  account  of this-expenditure in connection with purchase and supply of feeding stuffs, marketing, &amp;e., during thefirst six years, at the end of which period the buildings would have a small saleable value.
inexperienced  persons, we have  asked  the  Ministry of  Labour  to give us-provisional-estimates of cost for training in poultry keeping.     77.  Under the scheme proposed by them, selected unemployed married men would be drafted to one of the Department^ farm training Centres, assuming the farms to be  still available, for six months&apos; intensive training including the months of  January,  February  and March.   Their wives  and families  would remain at home under maintenance.     78.  At  the end of the six months, the man would be placed on the holding and  his wife  and family and belongings would be transported there.  He wouldbe under supervision and instruction from the supervisor, whose appointment  is part of our earlier proposals, for  two years.  The cost of training 100 men onthis  basis is  estimated to be  7,000 without allowing  for wastage.  Costs on a comparable scale would, we assume, be incurred in the case of market  garden-holdings, where training was necessary.             IV. Financial Summary (see I,  II and  III above).    79.  Average cash payments  and  receipts over the first twelve years inrespect of every 1.000 holdings (England and Wales) :     (i) Recurrent payments and receipts                                                                          Payments  per annum ...       ...      ...     59,393             Receipts per  annum   ...       ...      ...     48,189        Excess of payments   ...       ...       ...     11,204*             (After twelve years in virtue of the sinking fund arrangements.        adopted, the annual excess of payments over receipts will fall to-         8,700.)(ii) Non-recurrent payments, irrecoverable     (a) Initial expenses other than training                                                 1st year    ...      ...       ...       ...     83,5002nd &quot;year    ...      ...       ...       ...     22.500Total  ...       ...       ...    106,000             Later years :  Very small  additional  costs will be                 incurred.         (b) Training expenses                   7,000  per  100  men  trained (the proportion of  the  LOOO1             settlers  requiring training is uncertain).     NOTE. The costs in Scotland will be on  a higher scale.     80.  These figures as regards England and Wales mean an initial payment by the Exchequer of  106  per settler and  an  annual contribution of  11  persettler (in  addition to costs  of  training amounting to   70 for each  settlertrained).     The capital (though not the  annual)  cost would be reduced      (1) If  land  already  in the ownership  of Government  Departments (see           paragraph 75) were utilised.  This would  save the capital cost of the           land.     (2) If  some of the settlers provided from their own  resources the whole or           a portion  of the working capital required.&apos;&apos; Bare Land &apos;&apos; Holdings.     81.  It is possible that holdings of the kind  with which we have dealt might,in certain circumstances,  be provided in  the vicinity of the intending tenants&apos;homes, thus avoiding  the cost of erection of dwelling-houses and also the cost of   * Plus some later costs under the head of fresh working capital on vacancies occurring.
                                            9 A transport, together with  the risk attending the removal of tenants  to strange surroundings.  For example, it is conceivable  that near mining villages  where the pits have closed clown, land might be acquired at a reasonably low figure for the purpose of providing unemployed persons with &quot; bare land &quot; holdings which they could work while retaining their present housing accommodation.  There are, however,  certain  difficulties, the most serious of which arise out of the fact that the enjoyment of the land would depend on the enjoyment  of a house not  in the same ownership.    82.   We are, however, of the opinion that these difficulties can be overcome in certain of the depressed  areas,  where the local industry has collapsed entirely and there are opportunities of providing the residents with small holdings.   It has not been possible for  us to make detailed enquiries into the subject, but we have requested the Departments concerned to make a sample investigation.    83.   It will be understood that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who has been unable to attend the meetings of the Committee, at which the question of land  settlement has been considered, is not committed to the  conclusions  and recommendations contained in this Report.             SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS   AND CONCLUSIONS.    84.   We submit  to  the   Cabinet  the following recommendations  and conclusions on the subject of Land Settlement:     (a) Introductory. We point out that recent changes in fiscal policy with regard  to agriculture, the  fall in  interest rates, and the new aspect  which unemployment  has taken  on  in  the depressed  areas, make a reconsideration of land settlement policy  urgent and desirable (paragraphs 1 to 11).    (b) Existing Provisions. We have examined the existing provisions for small holdings, through the County Councils in England and the Department of Agriculture in Scotland.  Although, as regards England and Wales,  we are not entirely satisfied with these  provisions, we do  not  feel justified  in present circumstances in recommending any change in them.  We think, however, that they should be supplemented in other  directions  (paragraphs 12 to 32).    (c) Possible  Developments. We  point out that  the existing schemes only deal with experienced persons  possessing  the necessary  capital for  working holdings.   We believe  that many unemployed persons in industrial occupations could successfully be settled on  the land,  and quote evidence in support of  this view.   An examination of various jx)ssibilities leads  us to the conclusion that market gardening,  to a  limited  extent, and  poultry keeping, are the main occupations in which small holdings development is practicable, on a basis, which, taking all things into  consideration,  would be  profitable to the State. Detailed estimates  of cost and probable receipts are made (paragraphs 33  to 60).    (d) Method of Operation. While the Land Utilisation Act  contains powers which would enable a  policy of  land settlement for unemployed men, &amp;c, to be undertaken by the Government, we do not recommend this method, which, among other  things, would involve a revival of direct  borrowing by the State, since the major costs of the scheme could not reasonably be financed out of revenue.  We accordingly  suggest  that powers  be  taken  to  set  up  a  Land  Settlement Commission on the lines  of a Public Utility Company, with power  to borrowmoney under State  guarantee.   The  Commission would  equip holdings  and advance working capital;  other expenses in connection with the scheme, such as removals,  training, supervision and temporary maintenance of settlers, would be borne directly by the State and financed out of  revenue (paragraphs 61 to  ?4). js&quot;    (e)  Immediate Programme. We recommend that the Ministry of Agricul- ture and  Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland should be authorised to proceed  with an  experimental scheme for the provision of 1,000 holdings for unemployed men, &amp;c, and that, when the Commission is set up,  it should aim at a minimum  five-year programme of 1,000 holdings  in its first year, and 2,500 holdings in each of the four subsequent years (paragraph 65).    (f)  Training. While we consider that attention should, in the  first  place,be concentrated on experienced men not  in need of training, and, where possible,
in possession of some working capital, a provisional scheme on which training forpoultry keeping might be conducted is put forward (paragraphs 76 to 88). ft^.    (g) Special Scheme. In Appendix IV  to this Report we give details of ascheme for converting into small holdings, by means  of trainee labour, farms atClaydon and Brandon, now in the possession of the Ministry of Labour. We pointout that the disposal of these farms is under  contemplation, and we consider thatthe suggested method of disposal is that most desirable and profitable.    (h) Before, however, any progress on the lines suggested in this Report canbe made, it is imperative that the  Government should reach definite conclusions on the following questions of policy :     (1) Should  an  ad hoc Commission be  established  as recommended  in           paragraph 63 ?    (2) If the State is to provide the capital required by the Commission, is the           money to be found by borrowing  (as we think is inevitable) or out of           revenue ?    (3) If by borrowing,  should the State  advance money to the Commission           direct; alternatively should  the  Commission  borrow&apos;  in  the  market           with a State guarantee ?    In conclusion, we wish to observe that the Scheme set out in Part II of thisReport can only be  successful if the small holders are assured of economic prices for their produce this implies a continuance of the present policy of affordingreasonable protection to the agricultural industry  including the small  holderswith whom this Report is particularly concerned.

APPENDIX I.                         SMALL HOLDINGS IN 1931.            Extract from Ministry&apos;s Land Division Report, 1931.    From  reports  received from the  Ministry&apos;s Land  Commissioners  it  is apparent that, generally speaking, small holders have so far weathered the presentagricultural depression in a remarkable way, and that in all parts of the countrythey have been &quot;doing better&quot; than  the large farmers.   Among the reasonsadvanced for the small holder&apos;s greater resistance to low prices are :     (a) he has fewer payments to make, e.g., for labour;    (&apos;&amp;) less credit is given to him, and consequently when he incurs a &quot; paper &quot;           loss through fall in value of stock in trade he is less embarrassed by           pressure for payment of debts;    (c) he is rarely burdened with heavy mortgage interest;    (d) most of  his stock is reared and grows into money, whereas the farmer           purchases for running on or fattening, and thus has to meet the full           effect of falls in prices;    (e) he can generally  change his type of farming much quicker to adapt           himself to changing conditions; and    (/) he is often a larger consumer, proportionately, of his own  produce.    Although some counties are experiencing difficulty  in collecting  rents,  ingeneral the proportion of rents collected has been surprisingly high, and abate-ments  have been small.  This  is all the more remarkable when it is rememberedthat the small holder is usually unable to obtain the same credit facilities fromtradesmen as is the large farmer, and, generally, has to pay off other  creditorsbefore he can pay his rent. In one of the largest small holdings counties, no lessthan 82 per cent, of the statutory small holders had a clean slate with regardto rent.    There are indications, however, in several parts of the country that  smallholders will be severely tried if the present low prices continue much longer.[7883i)

APPENDIX III.                            POULTRY  HOLDINGS.    Possible utilisation of a block of 345 acres of EarVs Down at Amesbury.    This  345  acres  was  recently  reported  on by a  firm of  land  surveyors ofrepute and  scheduled  as worth  9 per acre  subject, with  other lands, to aterminable tithe redemption annuity of  3s. 8d. per acre.    The area  possesses facilities for division into numerous holdings of smallareas, viz. :         Existing road frontage to three public  roads.        Chalk subsoil making the foundation work  and roadmaking less than            normal.        Gradual south-westerly slope.        Availability of own water supply.    The following considerations  would  influence lines  of development anddivision :     (1)  The main road frontage is short relatively to  the area (about 1,000 feet),          and as any plots fronting this road would be intersected by the course          of  the prehistoric ditch dotted on the plan, the frontage has been          excluded  and  the division commenced from the  south side  of  the          ditch.    (2)  On each of the two by-road frontages as many plots of approximately          5 acres each have been shown as could be formed with a proportionate          shape.  On the Salisbury Road are 16 plots with an average frontage          of 200 feet and depth of 1,000 feet;  on the eastern road are 18 plots          with frontage 180 feet and depth 1.200 feet.    (3)  To develop the back land two cul-de-sac roads are formed, each 500 yards          long, giving access to 14 and 12 plots respectively.  A  strip 40 feet          in  width is  reserved for road and connecting footpath, but  9 feet          width only to be metalled.  Intentionally the roadway is not carried          continuously  through, as it  has  been found that this attracts cross          traffic and necessitates upkeep.  The outlet to the west faces a private          road, by which the route to  Amesbury would be shortened for most          occupants of the new plots.    (4)  The present reservoir is at a height of  about  370  feet,  whereas Earls          Down rises  to 450 feet.   Supplementary  pumping  and  a  higher          auxiliary reservoir would therefore be needed, with extension of  the          present 2^-in. main, and branches therefrom.    (5)  The lay-out suggested permits each bungalow to have a southerly aspect          unobstructed by neighbouring buildings.    (6)  A fence has been allowed for on both sides of the new  road  and foot-          path in view of  its probable use for the  purpose of  access to more          than 30  holdings, while the  divisions between  the various holdings          are  marked by quick fencing, partly  from consideration of amenity          and shelter.    (7)  The bungalows along the  present i&apos;oad frontages  are singles,  those on          the inner holdings (chiefly on account of narrower frontages)  are in          pairs.  There would be little or no saving in pairs, since with wholly          timber construction it would presumably be necessary  to take special          precautions in party wall work.
The total capital cost might amount to  27,840, made up as under:                                                                  Land 333 acres (deducting main road frontage), say    3,000    Cost of extinguishment of tithe redemption annuity    1,340    Cost of new access roads (9 feet wide, metalled)  ...    1,000    Fencing both sides of roadway and path  ...       ...      300    Supplementary pump, main and reservoir  ...       ...    2,160    60 bungalows at  300 each     ...       ...       ...   18,000    Quick fencing  between holdings, average 500 yards,        say,  34 each      ...      ...       ...       ...    2,040                                                     27,840                  Number of settlers :  60.Capital cost of land, buildings, &amp;o, per holding  ...      464    In  addition,  other  costs would be incurred  on maintenance allowances,working capital,  local  supervision,  removals,  training   and  administrative expenses.

TRIAL LAY-OUT TO6OKXIOTOH0IJaNGSEARLS FARM DOWN -  345 ACRES( PART OF THE MINISTKVS AMESBURY FARM SETTt-EMENT
APPENDIX IV.   CONVERSION  OF  MINISTRY OF LABOUR  FARMS INTO POULTRY  HOLDINGS.     The Ministry of Labour have  two farms,  at Weeting,  near Brandon inNorfolk, and at Claydon, near Ipswich, which were acquired for the purpose oftraining farm labour for Canada and Australia, and recently,  since training formigration ceased, have been conducted on a care and maintenance basis.   TheTreasury have now asked that, as there is little prospect of training for migrationbeing necessary in the near future, the farms should be disposed of.  They cannotanyway  be  sold  before  next  autumn,  and,  unless  agriculture  improvessubstantially, it will be difficult to  get rid of them at all,  and the price  wouldinvolve considerable capital loss.  At each place there is an instructional centre,housed in hutments at Brandon, and in a disused workhouse, at Claydon,  whereunemployed men are being reconditioned on work for the Forestry Commission,or on the farms  in unskilled  land work.  The cost of removal  or replacement ofthese instructional  centres will exceed  any probable  proceeds of the sale  ofthe farms.     It would be possible to establish a number  of small holdings  at each place and  to equip them by  trainee labour with bungalows, fencing,  roads, &amp;c.         (a) Brandon. The farm consists of 824 acres, of which 514 are held by     the Office of Works on behalf of the  Ministry of Labour, and 310 are rented     from the  Forestry Commission. On the Office of Works land 28  5-acre     holdings for poultry keeping  could  be provided, and   on  the  Forestry     Commission land, if it were made available, 50 more 5-acre poultry holdings     could be provided.    This would leave in the centre of  the  estate a good     compact dairy farm, which  would probably  be saleable.         The capital cost of providing by  trainee labour bungalows,  poultry sheds,     roads, water and fencing is estimated at  220 per holding.   This includes     the capital value of the land as valued by the District Valuer.         (b) At  Claydon, where there are about 400 acres, the property of the     Office  of  Works, 21  5-acre  holdings could be  provided  and equipped     at a cost of about  237 each. The rest of the  farm would provide, in addition,     6  good holdings  of  about 40 acres each,  on each of which  a practically     complete range of buildings is already standing.   These holdings  would     probably let in the open market, or might be taken over by the Suffolk County     Council.     There are buildings at both  Brandon and Claydon, not included in the aboveschemes and not likely to be saleable under any conditions except at scrap  value,which  would be  suitable for central administrative purposes.     On the basis of these estimates, the total capital cost, including the assumeavalue of  the land, of providing 78 holdings at Brandon, would be about  17,000,and  21 holdings  at Claydon about  5,000.  In addition there would be other costs as set out in paragraphs 52 to 59 of  our Report, incurred in settling men on theseholdings.     If  authority were given for   the  work  to be  begun  before Christmas,28 holdings at Brandon and 21 at Claydon could be ready for  occupation by theend of September, 1933.     This scheme is  of limited application in that its costs do not include itemsnow borne on the Training Vote of  the Ministry of Labour.  These can properly be ignored in so far as the work is undertaken under the existing training andreconditioning programme of  the Ministry.   If, however, a larger scheme on theselines involving increased provision  for training were adopted, these costs could not longer be ignored.
