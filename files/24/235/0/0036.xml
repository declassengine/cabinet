I circulate, for  the information of my colleagues,     a note of  the  proceedings at a  deputation which I     received from  the British Committee on  3mpire Trade  on     the possibility of  discrimination in India against     British  trade, industry and shipping.

!S5I w wive&apos;Note of deputation from the British Committee on Empire Trade, on the subject of India,  received    &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade on      Wednesday * 14th December at .3.15 p.m.The deputation consisted of   Sir Alan  Anderson, K.B.E.   Sir William Currie   Mr. P.G. Allen   Mr. H.M. Cleminson   Sir Hugo Hirst, Bart.   Mr. John Taylor   Mr. Moir Mackenzie   Mr. Watt   Sir Stephen Demetriadi, K.B.E   Mr. T. Barlow   Mr. A.de V.

Poloy                    Mr. W,B.  Brown                    Mr. R.J.  Shackle.     Sir Alan Anderson, who opened the proceedings,  emphasised the great importance of avoiding racial differentiation in thenew Constitution and of incorporating in it full safeguards against such discrimination in the matter of trade,  industryand shipping.   These safeguards should be operated as rules oflaw, the veto of the Governor-General and of the provincialGovernors being retained only as&quot;an additional safeguard.   Inany case, persons who considered that they had been injured bydiscrimination should have an appeal to the Supreme Court andChamber of Shipping.Federation of British     Industries.London Chamberlain	er	Of	Commerce.Manchester	tt		ttLondon	ii	tt	ttManchester .	11	it	ttAssociation	of	British	 Chambers of Commerce.        -do-Association of Insurance      Offices.
                                                       1 0 Jultimately to the Privy Council,,    He recalled that  some   703millions of British capital were estimated to he invested inIndia, and that United Kingdom exports to India amounted to7$ of all United Kingdom exports and to 18^4 of our exports tothe Empire.   Already there had been threats to depriveBritish-born subjects and British enterprises of their commercial rights in India and to hand them over to  the natives of the country.   It was vital that the safeguards should heprovided in the Constitution.     Sir Stephen Demetriadd said that British commercial interests asked for no preference over Indians, but  only  forthe same rights.   In law Indians had always enjoyed equalityin this country, and commercial bodies here, particularly theLondon Chamber of Commerce, had taken steps to secure thatextra-legal disabilities were also removed as far as possible.Thus, Indian business men here had in the past been  somewhataggrieved because none of them were members of the variousLondon Exchanges.   As a result however of appeals which  hadbeen made by the Chamber, Indians had now been admitted to membership.     It was of paramount importance that the principle of equality should be embodied in the Constitution and  not merelyin  a trade treaty.   Presumably a power of veto vested in theGovernor-General and provincial Governors would be effective against any measure that conflicted with the Constitution, butthat alone was not enough, because the power would not beexercised till legislation had already been passed,  and thus it would assume a very definite political complexion.  Itcould not be exercised purely on the merits of the case but would be subject to extraneous political considerations andthe procedure would tend to keep anti-British agitation alive.
4 Of!lie -would prefer to see the Speakers of the LegislativeAssemblies rule out discriminatory measures in advance as&quot;being  unconstitutional.   Should such measures however be passed and not be vetoed, an appeal should lie to the Courts.     Mr. Barlow, speaking on behalf of the Manchester cotton trade, emphasised the main points made by previous speakers.     Sir William Currie. speaking for shipping interests,laid stress on the need for constitutional safeguards.   Thereport of the Simon Commission had suggested that a safeguardingclause in the Constitution would not meet the case, becauseadroit lawyers or politicians could find means to evade it.The Commission accordingly recommended the employment of the governors&apos; veto.   But in a crisis the use of this power of veto would be impracticable for reasons suggested by previousspeakers.   The certification of the Salt Tax duringLord Reading&apos;s Viceroyalty, which had roused a gx^eat deal of feeling in India, was an illustration of this danger.     As regards shipping, there was constant policicalpressure to drive British shipping out of the coasting trade of India and the trade between India and Burma.    If the attack on shipping succeeded, no doubt other interests would find it was their turn next.    He urged that specific mention of shipping should be made in any clauses which might beprepared for embodiment in the Constitution.    It was true thatthe last Imperial Conference had agreed that self-governingparts of the Empire should have the power to legislate fortheir own merchant shipping.    At the same time  however theyentered into the Imperial Merchant- Shipping Agreement(operative for an initial period of 5 years)  which provided.that there should be no differentiation as between british ships registered, in different parts of the Empire.   India wasnot a party t^ that agreement, but it might be asked why she                               -3-
                                                          ion                                                          X. 0 ishould not have the same rights as the Dominions.   Tneanswer to this was that the Indians&apos;  intention to  excludeBritish shipping from their coasting trade was already known.liven in Australia there was no formal prohibition  against  our ships engaging in the coasting trade, but such a requirementas had been proposed in India, that 75$ of the shareholdingand directors of the companies concerned must be Indian,would suffice to kill our coasting trade there.    Moreover,India relied on the British Navy for protection in war andshould therefore treat fairly the British mercantile  marine onwhich the British Navy was so largely dependent.   It was estimated that some 400,000 tons of British shipping  would be thrown idle if excluded from the Indian coasting trade.     The safeguards against such discrimination should beincluded in the Constitution.     Mr.  Taylor (Messrs. Mather &amp; Platt) emphasised theimportance of India as a market for United Kingdom engineering products.     The President.replying to the deputation, said that hewould report to his Ministerial colleagues the strength  ofthe deputation&apos;s feelings in this matter.   Warning them thathis remarks Bhould be treated as strictly confidential,  heassured the deputation that it was His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;intention to include safeguards against discrimination In  theConstitution,   He recognised that such discriminationconstituted a very special danger for shipping.    It was thedesire of the British representatives at the present session ofth4 Round Table Conference to give to the Indian people  allthat was required for their freedom and self-governmentconsistently with the safeguards he had mentioned.   Thesesafeguards would in the first plaoe be incorporated in theConstitution and would further be reinforced by a power  of veto                               r4-
o ovesting in the Governor-General and the provincial Governors.It was to be expected that the exercise of this power of vetowould be rarely required;  nevertheless, it might be a usefuladditional safeguard.   Provision would be made for an appealto the Courts and from them to the 1&apos;rivy Council in the eventof any discriminatory action being taken contrary to theprovisions to be inserted in the Constitution.     Sir Stephen Demetriadi once more stressed the importanceof giving the Speakers of the Legislative Assemblies powers to rule out of order in advance measures contemplating 1discrimination.     Sir Alan Anderson then thanked the President on behalfof the deputation, and they withdrew.Board of Trade,   16th December, 1932.
