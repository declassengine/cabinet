(Previous Paper No. CCS. 300.)                                 Report.    IN our Interim Report* we promised a further report  dealing with  theconcerted naval, military and air action which might be necessary for the local defence of  the  Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s property in South Persia if  thesituation deteriorated and  the  Persian  Government  showed signs of military action for the seizure of the oil wells.    We forward herewith a Report, with the conclusions of which we are in full agreement, prepared under our instructions by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee.    There is one possibility which is not dealt with  in this Report,  namely, a sudden coup-de-main on  Abadan by the Persian military forces at Ahwaz.  Theonly measure which could be taken in anticipation of such a contingency wouldbe the strengthening of the available naval forces by ordering H.M.S. enterprise and H.M.S. Emerald from India to the head of the Gulf.  It is for His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment to  decide whether in existing  circumstances such a  move would be politically desirable.                                        (Signed)      G. F.

                             ENCLOSURE.C.O.S. 300 (J.P.).]               -(Also Paper No. J.P. 81.)]         Protection of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s Property.   REPORT  OF THE JOINT PLANNING SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE CHIEFS OF STAFF                                COMMITTEE.                            Terms of Reference.     The Chiefs of Staff at their 104th Meeting on Wednesday, the 30th November, 1932, directed          &apos;&apos; That the Joint Planning Committee, with a member of the Staff of the     Military Secretary of the India Office, should meet without delay to consider     and report on the measures that could,  if necessary, be taken  to protect the     Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s  property.&quot;     In dealing with this reference, the Joint Planning Committee should consider to what  extent the recommendations of the Special Committee in 1924 (C.I.D. Paper No.  227-C) were  applicable to the present situation, and should also consider any possible measures of retaliation, such as rounding-up the Persian sloops, seizing the Persian Customs, &amp;c.     The Joint  Planning  Sub-Committee submit  their  Report  herewith,  the conclusions of which are summarised as follows                             Summary of Conclusions.     (a) Owing to the very limited forces available, and to the time it would take for them to reach the Persian Gulf,  immediate protection could not be afforded to the oilfield and pipe-line.   The latter must, therefore, be considered as open to forcible occupation by the Persian Government, and recapture could  not be effected until reinforcements on a large scale were provided from India or Home, i.e., for several months.     (b) Our  initial action must, therefore, be  limited to ensuring,  as far aspossible,  that British nationals are  safely evacuated from the oilfield and  pipe- line area to Abadan, and to protecting  the Company &apos;s refineries and other  plant at this place, which would become  the base for more extended operations at alater stage.     (c) Evacuation being  completed, and  our position at Abadan consolidated,various retaliatory measures would  be possible in the Persian  Gulf area.    (d) We have considered the problem in three phases       (i)  The present period of discussion.     (ii)  The period when evacuation  of  the employees  and dependants of  the           Anglo-Persian  Oil Company becomes necessary owing  to  aggressive           action by the Persian Government.    (iii)  The period  when retaliatory action becomes  possible  owing to  the           completion of the evacuation or opposition to it by  the Persians.     (e) Phase  1 :  Period  of Discussion. During this period any  action by ourselves which might precipitate forcible  action on the part of Persia should be avoided.  Any  movement  of troops  or  any air operations involving flying overPersian territory should, therefore, be avoided. If, however, there are indications that the  Persians  intend  to take forcible steps to prevent  the working of  the oilfields, it would be advisable to take the following preliminary measures     Movement of sloops to Basra.    Advance the programme of H.M.S. Hawkins.    Move additional air forces to Shaibah (Basra) from Hinaidi.    Prepare for movement of one battalion from Egypt by air or in  His Majesty&apos;s         ships.    Notification of the situation to  the  Indian Government.
    (f)  Phase 2 : Evacuation. Although the Company  would,  we understand,prefer to leave their employees as long as possible in the oilfield area, we  feel strongly it would be inadvisable to allow British nationals to remain as potentialhostages in that area, if it is intended to bring pressure to bear on the PersianGovernment by forcible measures.    The following action should, we consider, be taken during this phase       (i) Immediate movement of sloops and HALS. Hawkins to Abadan and the          landing of a party to protect the refinery and establishments.     (ii) Despatch H.M.S.  Enterprise and H.M.S. Emerald to Abadan.    (iii) Dispose naval forces to contain the Persian sloops and cover evacuation          of refugees to Basra.     (iv) Despatch troops by air from Egypt to Basra or by cruiser to the Persian          Gulf for landing at Abadan.     (v) Institute Air Reconnaissance over  Abadan and the  oilfield area.     (vi) Move a further squadron from  Baghdad to Shaibah and replace it at          Baghdad  from Egypt.               Steps would have to be  taken to  ensure  that Iraq raises no          objection  to locating military forces temporarily at Basra.    (vii) As soon as possible relieve the naval landing party at Abadan by troops,          and thus release our sloops, &amp;c, for retaliatory action elsewhere.    (g)  Phase  3 : Retaliation. The  following retaliatory  measures would be feasible and might have considerable moral effect       (i) Capture of the  Persian gun-boats.     (ii) Seizure of  Persian Customs at Abadan, Mohammerah, Henjam  and          Jask.    (iii) Bombing of selected military objectives and troop movements in the          oilfield area.     (iv) Stopping of visits by the British  India Steamship Company&apos;s vessels          to Persian ports.    To  guard against counter-attack in force by Persian Regular forces againstAbadan, a second British battalion should be moved from Egypt by sea or air assoon as  this  phase is  put into operation.    We consider it important, however, that the  first troops to arrive in Persiashould be white and not Indians.    (h)  If  the above action fails to  bring the Persian Government to reason,and the occupation of the oilfields is considered necessary, large-scale militaryoperations, entailing at the outset the employment of at  least two divisions, and additional  Air  Forces,  would be  involved.  The first division,  if from home,could not arrive in less  than 2\ to 3 months from the date of mobilisation.-    (i)  Any military action, even on a small  scale, in South Persia might havethe following  repercussions :       (i) The  Persians  might  create  diversions  by  advancing on  the Anglo-          Persian Oil Company&apos;s field at Khanikin in Iraq territory, or create          trouble in the Kurdish area.  &apos;     (ii) The  Shiah  population  in Iraq  (55 per  cent, of the population) might          seize the opportunity of giving trouble  as a means of gaining their own          ends and assisting their co-religionists, the  Persians.    (iii) Russia  might  intervene  on  behalf of Persia in  accordance with the          terms of the  1927 Treaty.  This  would  result  in an incalculable          extension of our commitments.     (iv) Ibn Saud might attempt to bring pressure to bear on Kuwait or  take          a more determined attitude towards Trans-Jordan.                                  (Signed)       R. H.

                                  REPORT.                           General Considerations.A ssumptious.     1.  In   consideration  of  this  problem,  we  have  made  two  necessaryassumptions :       (a) That the implications due to the fact that both Great Britain and Persia           are  Members of the League  of Nations and have signed such instru-           ments as the &quot;Optional Clause&quot; are matters for political considera-           tion and need not be dealt with by us in this appreciation.     (6) That the initiative in forcible action does not rest with  Great Britain;           and that it is both inexpedient and otherwise undesirable for any           Military move to be made until the action of the Persian  Government           forces such movement upon us.     2.  It follows from the second assumption that there  can be no question ofthe forcible  protection  of the Company&apos;s property in the oilfields area and atAbadan nor of taking  any  retaliatory  measures until the Persian  Governmenthas actively  interfered  with the normal operation of the oilfields.     It would therefore appear that, although it would be possible to afford promptprotection to the Company&apos;s property at Abadan,  the actual oil-producing area and  the pipe-line must be considered open to occupation  by the  Persians, andthat a recapture of these areas by us will be necessary before they can be forciblyprotected.Existing Defence Plans.     3.  We are of opinion that the recommendations of the Special Committee ofthe Committee  of Imperial Defence set up in 1924 to consider the  question of protecting the Anglo-Persian Oilfields (C.I.D. Paper No. 227-C) and  the existingDefence Scheme (referred to in Paper No. C.O.S. 300) are not  applicable to thepresent situation for the following reasons :      (a) Since 1924, when the Special  Report (C.I.D.  Paper  No. 227-C)  was          written,  the situation has altered, in the following respects :             (i)  A portion of the Persian Army (numbering about 2,000 men and                 18 guns) is now situated in the oilfield area at Ahwaz  and is                 charged with the protection of the Anglo-Persian oilfields area,                 while another similar  force is situated 200 miles away.           (ii)  It is estimated that the Persians could, in the  early stages and                 if  unopposed, concentrate a total force of some  15,000-20,000                 men, backed by 60-70 guns, in the oilfields area.          (iii) The total Persian Army numbers some 48,000 men,  inclusive of                 cavalry and  150 guns.          While not considering that the Persian Army attains a high standard          of efficiency, it would, we feel, be undesirable to send small bodies of          British  troops  into  the  oilfields  area to   protect the  various          installations.    (6) In  the  present situation the  Persian Government  is definitely our          opponent  from  the  start,   whereas   the 1924  scheme,  although          mentioning the possibility of the  Persian Government being hostile          at some  period, primarily envisaged that trouble would come from          local insurgents,  over  whom the Persian Government might have no          control.     (c) Similarly the 1930 Scheme purports to deal only with unorganised attack           in a situation in which the  Persian Government had been unable to           provide  adequate protection. Moreover, though the Government of           India have been requested by His Majesty&apos;s Government to earmark           a Brigade for the defence of the oilfields, as  proposed  in the 1930           Defence Scheme, the despatch of this Brigade must  be conditional on           the  situation in India  at the time, and in addition, as explained in           paragraph  17 of Paper No. CCS. 300,  the  early  appearance of           British troops in the initial  stages might have a great moral effect on           local tribes.
Description of the A nglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s Property (see Map, Appendix D).    4.  The  main oilfields of  the  Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd.,  are  atMasjid-i-Suleiman and Haft  Khel,  as shown on the attached sketch map.   Aswill be seen,  the distances involved  are considerable; for example,  from GodarLandar, on the Karun River, in the North to Abadan Island in the South  is some130 miles.    5.  At Tembi are situated the pumping and power stations; through it pass the pipe-line, the power and telegraph  cables and  the  local  light railway;  inaddition, the water supply of the oilfields is dependent on the power station atTembi.    Godar Landar, on the Karun River, is the site of the main pumping stationfor the water supply for the oilfields.    6.  Ahwaz is the site of important Anglo-Persian Oil Company workshops,stores, and  transhipment  equipment,  and  is  the  centre  of  the  pipe-lineorganisation. In addition, it is the capital of the Province of  Khuzistan  and  animportant military and political centre.    The boosting oil pumping stations at Mullathani, Kut Abdullah and Dorquainare (with the exception of Mullathani, which is not used at present)  vitally-necessary to the transit of oil  along the pipe-line from the oilfields to Abadan.Tiiese boosting  stations are spaced  at about  40-mile intervals on the pipe-line from Tembi to Abadan.    7.  Dar-i-Khazineh is the  railhead  of  the 2 ft. 6 in. gauge  railway in the oilfields, and is  also the riverhead on the Ab-i-Gargar.  Here also is situated thealternative water  supply, if it is necessary to abandon Godar  Landar.    At Rugizard  is the pumping station for Haft Khel water  supply.    At Abadan are the refineries and a modern port well equipped  for oil tankers.It is an island 50 miles long by 2 mil\es  broad, inhabited  by 600  Europeans and56,000 others; of  the latter, 12,000 are in the employment of the  Anglo-persian oil Company.    8.  It should be noted that the pipe-line itself is not considered especiallyvulnerable, as any damage can be easily repaired.    Occupation of, or damage to,  the pumping stations and generating plantwould put the whole oilfields out of action  for a long time as replacements are for the most part  unobtainable in the oilfields and may have to be obtained from england.Communications.    9.  The River  Karun  is navigable for river steamboats as  far as Ahwaz,where there are rapids.  Above the rapids the river is again navigable  as faras Dar-i-Khazineh.    The road between Abadan and Ahwaz may be out of action for weeks inthe early spring owing to floods.    Portions of the road from Ahwaz to Dar-i-Khazineh may be out of action for two or three days at a time after heavy rain.    The road Dar-i-Khazineh to the oilfield is metalled and very seldom outof action.    There is an excellent all-weather metalled road with steel bridges and concreteculverts from Maidan-i-Naftan to Haft Khel.    The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have a  Junker monoplane  in constant use for communication work, but it is not fitted with wireless.    The Company maintain Wireless Stations at Abadan (range 600-1,000 miles)and at Masjid-i-Sulaiman (range 150-200 miles).   There is no wireless at HaftKhel, but there is a land-line to Masjid-i-Sulaiman.    Landing grounds exist at Abadan, Ahwaz, Maidan-i-Naftun, Tel Bazun andHaft Khel, and information regarding them is included in Appendix B.    The above road and railway communications are  illustrated in the sketchmap at Appendix D.

Personnel in Anglo-Persian Oil Company Employ,    10.   The  employees (and  their  dependants) of  the Anglo-Persian  oil company in South Persia are as follows :     Abadan            527 Europeans (including 108 women and children).          1,138 Indians (including 179 women and children).         12,000 Natives.    Masjid-i-Suleiman Haft  Khel Pipe-line, &amp;c.            338 Europeans (including 78 women  and  children).           460 Indians (including 85 women and children).          4,700 Natives.    Further details are given in Appendix A.          Persian Military Strength and Disposition in Oilfield Area.    11.   For some years past the Persians  have been  carrying out a policy ofdisarming the  tribal guards in the  Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company  area  andreplacing them with Persian troops.   Considerable progress has been made incarrying out this policy, and at present Persian forces in and around the Anglo-Persian Oil Company area are as follows (according to an Order of Battle as atthe 1st April, 1932, forwarded by the British Military Attache, Teheran): Luristan Independent Brigade.    A total strength of 2,400 infantry, 450  cavalry,  8  guns, with headquarters at Khurremabad, and detachments at  Hassanabad (150), Burujurd (600), and atposts along the Khurremabad-Dizful Road.Khuzistan Independent Brigade.    A total strength of 2,400 infantry, 450 cavalry,  18 guns, with headquarters at Ahwaz, and detachments at Beni Turuf (15), Mohammerah (135), Shimhtar(15),  Behbehan (136  and 20 cavalry),  Dizful  (400  infantry, 50 cavalry,  and2 mountain guns).    These troops form  the normal garrison, and in the  event of disturbancesforces would  be sent from the  Central Garrison  at  Tehran,  which totals11,400 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, 48 guns.Persian A ir Force.    12.    The  present serviceable strength totals  some  18 aircraft of thefollowing types :     In addition there are a number of various types, Avro, Breguet, Spad, &amp;c.,.which have not flown for some time, and may be considered unserviceable.    Twenty Tiger Moths (a  training  type  of little military  value) have been ordered from the De Havilland Company, and seventeen are at present en route for Mohammerah and Bandar Shahpur.    The Persian Air Force is normally stationed at Tehran.  Its efficiency is low,and although  offensive operations  might be attempted in the oilfields,  or evenagainst the Basra area, it is  not expected that these could be sustained on anyscale against active opposition by  our own air force.  A list  of aerodromes inSouth Persian Oilfield Area is attached as Appendix B.Our Naval, Military and Air Forces Available.    13.  The following is a summary of British Forces immediately available or which, could  be made  available at short notice  (further details are given inAppendix C) : Russian-built D.J. 9A type.Junkers Monoplane of F. 13 type  ...Potez 25 type12 5 1
(a) Naval Forces.     4 Persian Gulf sloops could reach Abadan in 1-2-1 days.     3 cruisers of the East Indies Squadron could reach Abadan in 1-3 days.     3 8-inch-gun cruisers from the Mediterranean Fleet could reach Abadan in-9 days.     A landing  party from the Persian Gulf sloops and cruisers of the east indies Squadron could amount to  837 men with 615 rifles, 41 Lewis Guns and4  machine guns.  Ships  could have steam for slow  speed  and a proportion ofthe armament manned.     In an emergency a further 140 men could be landed, but this would completelyimmobilise the ships,  so long as the  landing party were ashore.     If ships were required to be detached to contain Persian gun boats,  or forany other duty, the number would be correspondingly reduced.(b) Military Forces.     2 British battalions in Egypt (provided the situation in Egypt permits).*     Transported by air,  a first contingent of 140  officers and men could reachBasra in 3 days.     A second contingent could reach Basra in 5 days.     A third contingent could reach Basra in 9 days.     A fourth contingent, bringing the total to 560 officers and men, could reachBasra in 11 days.     If cruisers of the Mediterranean Fleet were employed, a complete battalion from Egypt could reach Abadan in 8-9 days.t     It will be for consideration at  the time whether it would  be better to convey the  first battalion in H.M. Ships arriving as  a  complete  unit  in  8-9  days,with the necessary  transport and stores,  rather&apos; than by  air,  which  would entail the   battalion  arriving in  contingents without  stores or  transport atseveral days&apos;  interval.   Only 280  officers and men,  if  conveyed by air,  would arrive earlier than a whole battalion transported by sea.     The arrival of 8-inch-gun cruisers at Abadan from the Mediterranean, witha battalion  on board, might have considerably more moral effect than the arrival at Basra of troops in  comparatively small contingents.     There  are only  three 8-inch-gun cruisers  available in  the mediterranean fleet, and this number of ships would be insufficient to transport both battalionsto Abadan.     The Government of India has been asked, with Cabinet approval, to earmarkone brigade to be held in  readiness, but the despatch of this brigade will dependon the political situation existing at the time.(c) A ir Forces.     (i)  The following units are located  in Iraq, and could be made available ifthe situation in that country permits :              3 general purpose squadrons.             1 bomber transport squadron.             1 flying boat squadron.     Of the above, one general purpose squadron and the  flying boat squadron arealready at Basra, which is their normal location.     One general purpose squadron and one bomber transport  squadron  could arrive at Basra from Hinaidi in six hours from the time of issue of orders tomove, on the assumption  that the bomber  transport squadron was not employedin the carriage of troops at the time.     (ii)  Available in the  Middle East            The following could probably be made available :                One general purpose squadron.               One bomber transport squadron.           Further details are shown in Appendix C.   * It is doubtful whether more than two  battalions could he spared from Malta and Egypt withoutTeplacement from home.   t NOTE__Owing to the need for frequent overhaul of aircraft and engines of the existing type, itis probable that a further 14 days would be required for the move of the second battalion by air.
                   Development of the Situation in Phases.    14.  The situation may be summed up as follows:     The Persian Government are at present in a position to order work to ceasein the oilfields and, if necessary, to see that their orders are carried out by force,and that the personnel of  the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are evacuated.  Atthe same time they are obviously not  in a position to work the oilfields themselves and would  lose money if work stopped.    The British Forces immediately available are extremely limited, and protec-tion  against organised Persian aggression could not be afforded  to the oilfieldarea and the pipe-line until reinforcements on a large scale are provided from india or Home, i.e., for several months.    15.  Our  initial  action must,  therefore,  be limited  to ensuring  as far aspossible that British  nationals in the oilfield area  are  safely evacuated, and toprotecting  the  Company&apos;s  refineries and  other  plant at  Abadan,  which wouldbecome the base for more extended operations at a later stage.    Evacuation being completed and our  position at  Abadan  consolidated,various retaliatory measures of varying degrees of effectiveness would be possiblein the Persian Gulf  area.   Finally, if and when the necessary reinforcementscan be provided for  the reoccupation of the oilfields, a  major operation  couldbe considered.    16.  We have, therefore, considered the problem before us in three distinctphases: Phase 1 :  Period of Discussion.    The present period during which discussions take place between the Anglo-Persian  Oil Company and the Persian Government and/or the British andPersian Governments.Phase 2 :  Evacuation.    The period when, discussions under Phase 1 having failed, action is  takenby the Persian Government involving the evacuation of employees and dependentsand the occupation of the oilfield area by the Persian Army.Phase 3 : Retaliation.    The period when evacuation is sufficiently far  advanced  to  permit ofretaliatory action  being taken without imperilling  the safety of the evacuation,.or alternatively, when opposition by Persian authorities necessitates such action.-                       Phase 1. Period of Discussion.Action by Naval, Military and Air Forces.    17.  Any action by the forces of the Crown during Phase 1 which mightibeliable to misinterpretation is not  only inappropriate, but might also be provoca-tive and might precipitate forcible action on the part of the Persian Government.For this reason  any movement of troops  or any  air operations involving flying-over Persian territory are to be avoided.    18.  Notwithstanding the considerations put forward in the last paragraph,.we consider that, should any definite evidence be obtained that the Persians intend to take forcible steps to prevent the working of the oilfields, it would be advisable to take some preliminary measures for implementing the action proposed in the succeeding paragraphs.   Such action would  consist of the following:     Movement of sloops to Basra.    Advancing  the programme of H.M.S. Hawkins.    Movement of additional air  forces to Shaibah (Basra) from Hinaidi.    Preparations for movement of troops by air  or in His Majesty&apos;s Ships from         Egypt.    Notification of the situation to  the Government of India.                s
                            Phase 2: Evacuation.      19.  Though we understand that it is the desire of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that their employees should remain at their posts as long as possible, partial or complete evacuation may be forced upon them in a number of &quot;ways, e.g. :-      (a) by peremptory orders from the Persian Government to the Anglo-Persian           Oil  Company to cease  work in  the  fields,  but without physical           interference;      (b) by interference by Persian military  or police  authorities  in the oilfield           area  acting either  directly or indirectly under the orders of the           Persian Government;      (c) by local disturbance actuated by hostile propaganda resulting in  acts           of sabotage and  danger to the lives of the employees.      20.  The Company&apos;s attitude towards Contingency  (a) is worth recording. We  understand  that if  they received orders from the Persian Government  to cease work in the oilfields on the ground that their concession had been annulled, they would  not  hesitate to obey, but they  would wish  all  their male British employees to remain at their stations in the oilfield and pipe-line areas.      21.  They anticipate that  the  Persians would  not have any objection  to British nationals remaining in their present residences, and seeing that the plant was kept in proper order, and they fear that the local tribes and native  employees who are normally well disposed towards the Company might seize the opportunity for looting if all the personnel  were evacuated.      22.  We have no reason to  doubt that this is a correct appreciation of the situation from the Company&apos;s point of view, but we feel very  strongly that  it would  be inadvisable to allow British nationals to remain as potential hostages in the oilfield area, if it  were intended to bring pressure to bear on the Persian Government by forcible retaliation and occupation of Persian territory by British troops.  In  the  contingency contemplated, it would  therefore  be necessary  in our opinion to request the  Company to evacuate  all their  personnel  as far  as Abadan.      Evacuation, when  it becomes necessary, would have to be carried out by road under the Company&apos;s direction and with their own transport, which we under- stand is adequate, from  the outlying stations to Ahwaz, and thence by river  to Abadan and finally to Basra.      23.  The question of evacuation  by air has been considered, but must  be ruled out except  as a last resort for the reason that, with the Persian Government hostile, landing  grounds for the aeroplanes in the neighbourhood of the oilfields wrould most probably be too strongly occupied  by the Persian military authorities. We  recommend,  therefore, that evacuation by air should be  attempted only  if there is no other  means of saving life, and that it should be left to the Air-Officer- Commanding, in consultation with the Company&apos;s  officials, to decide whether the risks are warranted by the circumstances  existing at the time.      24.  If, however, it  be decided that one  flight of troop-carrying aircraft  be moved  to Shaibah (Basra) as  soon as evacuation is  decided upon, it  should  be borne in mind this would entail modification of the times required to move troops-from Egypt.      25.  We are definitely  of the  opinion that any action on the part of  His Majesty&apos;s Government which is likely to prejudice an unimpeded evacuation  is undesirable, unless the evacuation is interfered witlrthe Persian Government. Action by Naval, Military and Air Forces.      26.  This phase of the operations involves the entry of British forces  into Persian territory, but no offensive retaliatory  action is suggested.  The  following- are the principle measures which should be taken in this phase :       (a) Immediate movement of sloops and H.M.S. Hawkins to Abadan and the           landing of a party to protect the refinery and establishments;      (&amp;) Despatch of H.M.S. Enterprise and  H.M.S. Emerald to Abadan;
     (c) Naval  dispositions to contain  the Persian  Naval  forces  and  cover           evacuation  of refugees to Basra;     (cl) Air reconnaissance over Abadan, the pipe-line and the oilfield area;     (e) Despatch of troops by air from  Egypt to Basra; and by cruiser to the           Persian Gulf for landing at Abadan;          ^     (/) Movement of a further squadron  from Baghdad to Shibah and its replace-           ment at Baghdad from Egypt.In connection with  (e)  above, it is to  be noted that though in accordance with theAnnexure to the Treaty with Iraq transit is permitted the retention of troops inIraq is only allowed for in the event of a threat  of  war, and then only afterconsultation with the Iraq Government.   It will be advisable,  therefore, to ensurethat the Iraq Government would raise no objection to the proposed temporarylocation of troops at Basra.   In the event of any  such  objection they could be flown direct to Abadan.     27.  The troops from Egypt would relieve the naval landing party at Abadanas soon as possible  and should be sufficient to protect the refinery and deal withany  local attacks or disturbances.     23.  The object of the action proposed in this Phase is to cover the evacuationand  to consolidate our  position at Abadan as it would  be of cardinal importanceto maintain our position at Abadan while taking  such  retaliatory measures as are possible elsewhere.     29.  We would here again emphasise that any action on the part of HisMajesty&apos;s Government which is likely to prejudice an unimpeded evacuation is most undesirable, and that any display of  force on or over Persian territory shouldbe avoided until the safe arrival of refugees at Abadan is assured, or until it becomes clear that  the withdrawal of the employees  from the oilfields is beingforcibly interfered  with.                           Phase 3 : Retaliation.     30.  It is necessary to consider what retaliatory measures can be taken whenthe position at Abadan is  consolidated,  or if the Persian authorities oppose a peaceful evacuation. We do not deem it feasible to despatch our limited militaryforces up-country in the first instance in the face of a hostile Persian Government,but the following measures might be  considered :      (a) Capture of the Persian gunboats;     (b) Seizure of Persian  Customs at Abadan, Mohammerah, Henjam and Jask;     (c) Bombing of selected military objectives in the oilfield area.     31.  It is proposed to discuss these measures seriatim :      (a) The capture of the Persian gunboats should present  little difficulty, but           it must  be  remembered that  these gunboats are officered by Italian           officers.  After the Shah&apos;s recent visit of  inspection, such action would           be a great blow  to his prestige.     (6) Seizure of Customs has proved efficacious in other countries in the past,           and though in  this particular instance it would not result  in the           appropriation of many dues, it might have a considerable moral effect.           The principal ports affected are Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Mohammerah,           Abadan,  Henjam  and   Jask.    The  Customs  posts  at  Abadan,           Mohammerah, Henjam and Jask could be effectively occupied with           small forces supported by a sloop. The Customs-House at Bushire is,           however, out of  sight of the ship in the anchorage, and, furthermore,           Bushire, like Bandar Abbas, is a garrison port.  As regards Henjam,           there is little trade done in this island, but&apos;its  seizure and the removal           of Persian  officials would be a blow to the  Persians in view of their           claims to sovereignty.               It should be noted that the seizure of the  Customs at these ports,           with the exception of Abadan, would necessitate a sloop being detached           to each place.
    (c) As regards the question of bombing selected military targets, the most           suitable objectives for such action would obviously have to be chosen           according  ito  the situation at the time.  There are military head-           quarters at Ahwaz, Dizful, and other smaller towns within air range,           while any  troop movement on a large  scale from Central Persia into           the oilfield area would produce  very  favourable targets, as there is           practically a  single road only available.  We mention this form of           action because no other is feasible inland for several months, but we           do not regard air action by itself as an effective means of physically           preventing interference  with the  oilfields,  if  the  Persians  were           determined upon it, though we consider it might conduce to a desire           on the part of Persia for a speedy settlement of the dispute; on the           other hand, an extension of  the conflict by this means  might have           far-reaching and incalculable political effects.               The Committee assume that the political aspect of the use of Iraq           as a base for naval,  military and air operations may be considered as           covered by Article 4 of the Treaty,  the final sentence of which  reads           as follows  :              &quot; The aid of His  Majesty the  King of Iraq in the event of war or           the  imminent menace  of war  will  consist in furnishing  to His           Britannic  Majesty on Iraq territory all facilities and assistance in his           power,  including the use of railways, rivers, ports,  aerodromes and           means of  communication.&quot;    32.  Retaliatory  measures might involve a risk of a counter-attack by thePersian Regular Forces  against Abadan.  To meet this contingency, we recom-mend that the second  British battalion should be moved from Egypt by sea or airas soon as Phase 2 is put into operation.Economic Pressure.    33.  We have considered  the question of exerting  economic  pressure, andhave reached the conclusion that the economic results likely to be obtained from such action would be  almost negligible.  Persia is self-contained so far as food-stuffs are concerned, with the sole exceptions of tea and sugar.  While practicallythe whole of the latter comes in from the Caspian ports, the former comes from india and China through the Gulf ports,  and could, therefore, be stopped by action at sea or at the Persian Gulf ports; and, owing to its general consumption in Persia,  the stoppage of tea by  the cheapest route,  even if of small economic value, would, we suggest, have a widespread effect.  Persia&apos;s principal exports are oil, carpets and  dates, the oil  export  being through Abadan.  The date-exporting season is now closed for the year, and the carpet export can be regardedas immaterial.    34.  Some inconvenience might, we suggest,  be imposed upon Persia by the cessation of visits by British India Steamship Company&apos;s vessels to Persian ports,though it is for consideration whether this inconvenience would not be directedmainly towards the inhabitants of  South Persia, whose  friendly relations  weshould desire to retain.   The principal  ports  affected are Bushire,  Lingeh,Henjam, Bandar Abbas and Jask.   A considerable movement of Persian subjectsup and down the Persian coast takes place by means of these steamers and the cancellation of these visits might have the effect of impressing the Persian Govern-ment at Tehran.    An objection to this  step  is that an opportunity would be given to Russianships to capture trade at present carried in British bottoms.    35.  The retaliatory measures outlined  in the preceding paragraphs  mightwell cause the Persians to modify  their attitude and to seek terms for a renewal of negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.    Should this assumption prove to be incorrect and His Majesty&apos;s government consider it desirable to occupy the oilfields area this would entail a considerablemilitary expedition, the size of which would vary by the length of the operation;for it is probable that it would  not be possible to work the oilfields after they hadbeen  recaptured  without military  protection.   It  is  estimated that for  an operation of this  nature, a force of at least  two Divisions  initially would berequired, and  a third  should  be  available for relief purposes in the event of
operations being prolonged; while our Air Forces in the Middle East would haveto be considerably reinforced.     36.  This  would, in the  case  of troops from  Great Britain, necessitatemobilisation  with its inevitable repercussions  and delay.   It is probably noexaggeration to say that it would be impossible to land one complete division from home for  the recapture of the oilfields in less than 2\ to 3 months from thedate of mobilisation, while the second and third would be correspondingly later.     The provision of troops from  India,  for a major operation has not been investigated, as it is mainly a  political matter.   If a division or divisions couldbe provided, a reduction  in the  times stated would be possible.              Possible Repercussions to Military A ction in Persia.    37.  We  desire to invite  particular attention to the possibility of reper-cussions  as  the result of any military action which it may  be  decided  to  takeagainst Persia.   Such repercussions may be anticipated from four directions :     (a) Ibn Saud,  if he thought  there was any weakening in our attitude, or          taking advantage of the fact that we were preoccupied with  Persia,          might             (i) bring more pressure to bear  on Kuwait;          (ii) take a more determined attitude in the direction of Transjordan.    (b) The Persians, as retaliation for any action taken in the south, and  as a          means of creating a diversion, might             (i) advance on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s field in  the region                 of Khanikin (in Iraq territory);          (ii) create trouble in the Kurdish area.    (c) Operations in Persia are against a  Shiah power.   The Shiah population          in Iraq (approximately 55 per cent, of the population) are dissatisfied          with  the present regime, and might well  seize  the opportunity of          giving trouble,  both  as a means of  gaining their own ends  and          assisting their co-religionists.              We consider that regard must be paid  to the above in the event          of  any  operations  in  Persia,  as, should any  of the eventualities          materialise, they would have a considerable effect on the availability          of air forces in particular,  both  in Iraq and the Middle East.    id) The attitude which Russia might  adopt  should British military inter-          vention be necessary in South Persia, is one which, we  suggest, must          be  given  due consideration, and in this connection  we would invite          attention to paragrahph 12 of  the Memorandum by the Permanent         - Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 421  (32)) :-               &apos;&apos; The  second  protocol annexed to the Perso-Soviet  Treaty of          Guarantees  and  Neutrality  of 1927  expressly  provides for  the          maintenance in force of article 6 of the Perso-Soviet Treaty of 1921,          which lays down that &apos; if a  Third Power attempts to realize, by armed          intervention, a policy of violence on Persian soil  . .  . ., and if, after          due warning by the Soviet Government, the Persian Government show          themselves to be not sufficiently strong to avert this danger, the Soviet          Government  shall  have  the right  to  despatch  troops  to Persian          territory in order to take such military measures as may be necessary          for self-defence.&apos; Whether or not the armed intervention of  British          military forces solely to protect the oilfields from attack could properly          be  described as &apos; an attempt to  realize .... a policy of violence on          Persian  territory,&apos;  it  is certain that  Persia  would describe it as          such, and if,  as may confidently be assumed, she were unable  to  offer          effective resistance to a British expeditionary force, she might in the          last resort be forced to countenance an armed incursion of Russian          troops into Persian territory.  Such  a  contingency  is admittedly          remote, in view of Persia&apos;s  traditional fear of Russian aggression, but          the relevant  article is couched  in terms  so vague that it might be          possible for the Soviet Government to claim  the right,  in the  last          resort, to decide without reference to Persia whether a situation had          been created which would justify their intervention on Persian soil.&quot;
     We are unable to forecast the probable reaction on Russia of forcible Britishaction in South Persia, but we feel bound to invite attention to the fact that the intervention  of Russia  would  result  in an incalculable  extension  of our commitment.APPENDIX A.Employees (and Dependents) of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in South Persia.-	Europeans.

It is doubtful whether more than 2 battalions could be spared from malta and Egypt, without replacement from home.    The Government of India has been asked to earmark one brigade to be heldin readiness, but the despatch of this brigade will depend on the political situationexisting at the time.Movement of Troops.    No. 216 Squadron earring the 1st contingent of 140 officers and men could reach Basra^ from Egypt on Z+3 day.    The 2nd contingent of equal strength (carried by No. 70 Squadron) could arrive at Basra on Z+5 day.    The 3rd contingent of 140 men (second trip of No. 216 Squadron) could leaveEgypt on Z 4-6 day and arrive Basra onZ+9 day.    The 4th contingent of equal strength (second trip of No. 70 Squadron) couldleave  Egypt on Z + 8 day and arrive Basra on  Z 4-11 day.    The transport of  the 2nd and 4th  contingents  would preclude  the use ofthese  aircraft  of No. 70  Squadron  for the  evacuation of  the oilfields.  Ifevacuation of the oilfield by air were decided upon, troop movements by air wouldbe thrown out accordingly.    It is considered that, with the present type of bomber-transport aircraft,the move of the second battalion would not be completed by air until about Z 4-25days;  and even this estimate is dependent  upon a higher degree of reliabilitythan can perhaps be expected when using the present type of engine.                               (c) Air Forces.    (i) The following Units are located in Iraq, and could be made available ifthe situation in that country permits :          3 General Purpose Squadrons (Nos. 30, 55 and 84).         1 Bomber Transport Squadron (No. 70).         1 Flying Boat Squadron (No. 203).
    Of the above, 1 General Purpose Squadron and the Flying Boat Squadronare already at Basra, which is their normal location.Available in the Middle East.    (ii) The following could probably be made available :         1 General Purpose Squadron (No. 45).        1 Bomber Transport Squadron (No. 216).Movement of Squadrons.    (iii) One additional General Purpose Squadron and one Bomber TransportSquadron, could arrive at Basra from Hinaidi, provided they were not engaged introop carrying at  Z +1 6 hours (Z being the time of issue of instructions tomove).  It would  be necessary to replace the General  Purpose Squadron atHinaidi.   This  replacement could  be carried out  by  No.  45  Squadron byZ  -f 2 day.
