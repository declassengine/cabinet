December 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy  No.  9CP. 437  (32).CABINET.MEAT  POLICY.         Memorandum by the Minister of A gricidture and Fisheries.    I.   IN my memorandum CP. 401 (32), I reported the action which had beentaken by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the President of the Boardof Trade and myself since the Cabinet discussed the question of meat policy onthe 2nd November.    2.   This action  resulted  in a voluntary agreement with representatives ofDominion and foreign Governments or importing interests, for a reduction inthe supplies of all the chief kinds of imported meat for  a period  of about twomonths.    3.   These arrangements terminate early in January in the case of all meatsexcept  bacon and hams,  though the  reduction in shipments from the Dominionsis  only now beginning to be felt.   The arrangements with the bacon-supplying countries terminate on the 22nd January.    4.   Experience of the arrangements to date has shown that     (a) on the whole, they have worked smoothly and well,    (b) the fall in prices has been stopped and confidence restored,    (c)  there has been the least possible interference with  normal trade channels.          An expert Committee (the Linlithgow Committee) has been appointed          to watch the working of the arrangements in the field  of distribution.    5.   The improvement in the situation has been appreciated not only by homefarmers, but,  it is believed,  by the other participants as well, and it would generally be regarded as  unfortunate if matters were allowed to get out of handagain.    6.   It seems  advisable,  therefore, that the position  should be reviewedforthwith in consultation with Dominion and  foreign interests with due regardto the provisions of the Ottawa Agreements  Act.   These  consultations will take some little time and they  must be begun at once as shippers are naturally anxious for as  long notice as possible of any modification  of their  programmes.  in anticipation, the South American importers have already arranged to continuethe reduction of chilled beef shipments for a period of six weeks in the New Year.    7.   It is. therefore, important  that,  before  --ie  Cabinet  disperses1 for christmas, the Ministers concerned should bo authorised, to negotiate for such further measure of co-operation as may be considered necessary  in the light of expert  advice, it  being  understood that  no  reductions  beyond those  already authorised are contemplated.    8.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the President of theBoard  of Trade concur in the terms of this Memorandum.                                               (Initialled)       W. E. E.    Ministry of A gricidture and Fisheries,            December 16,  1932.[7997]
