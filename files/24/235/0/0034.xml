[IS DOCUMENT IS T.HE PROPERTY OP HIS BRI TAHITI C MAJESTY&apos; S GQVEESMENT.)1.   At their Meeting on November 33rd, 1932, (Cabinet 62(32)Conclusion 2), the Cabinet agreed that a Cabinet committee composed as follows should meet to consider questions relating to hunger marchers . -The Home Secretary  (In the Chair)The Minister of health the Minister of labour the Secretary of State for scotland the Attorney-GeneralThe Lord Advocate.2.   7/e have examined the question of the prevention ofconcentrations and processions similar in character to therecent concentration in London of the hunger marchers in thelight of a Memorandum by the Home Secretary, covering aMemorandum prepared by a Conference of representatives ofthe Departments concerned, and of Memoranda by the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate.3.   The present legal position may be briefly summarisedas follows :-   England and Wales.  There are no provisions in theexisting law by which organised processions   can be prevented from marching to London or elsewhere provided thatX o.p.  434(52)C A 3 IKE T.COMMITTEE ON THE KUNGTR MARCHERS.INTERIM REPORT.
                                                               1 77they are orderly and well-behaved.  The existing provisionsof the criminal law dealing with me&apos;* tings and processionsare applicable, broadly speaking, only where obstruction is,or may be, caused or a breach of the peace results or may reasonably be apprehended.  In London, apart from the SeditiousMeetings Act of 18.17 (which prohibits the calling of meetingsof more than fifty persons in any open place within one mileof Westminster Hall when Parliament is in Session) the onlystatutory powers possessed by the  Police relate to the regulation of the route of a procession, but there is no powerto prohibit a procession or to require it to disperse so longas it is orderly.  The powers of local authorities in theprovinces are equally defective.   Scotland.  In Scotland the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act gives the magistrates much wider powers than exist in England tomake byelaws and issue notices and orders for the regulationof street traffic, including &quot;prohibiting or regulating publicprocessions&quot;.  These powers are of course of strictly localapplicat ion.4.   The difficulties caused by public meetings and processionsin London have been repeatedly considered by the Home Officeand the Law Officers and during the last 150 years, while muchlegislation has been passed, the policy of successive government -mants has been against legislation to interfere with the rightof holding meetings and processions simply because they may beconsidered as likoly to lead, in certain circumstances,  to a breach of the peace.5.   We are advised that no amendment of extension of theexisting regulations designed to prohibit processions from entering London could certainly be relied on. to prove effective in practice.                              -2-
                                                            1 7Pand that no satisfactory solution of the problem can be found by continuing the present policy of withholding from themarchers facilities for drawing transitional payment orunemployment benefit at Exchanges which they may pass en route.k strengthening of the law so as to give the Poor Lawauthorities more drastic powers as regards the conditions ofthe grant of relief to hunger marchers is desired by theMinister of Health, but we are advised that it would bedifficult to enforce and in an3r case it would not in itselfprovide a solution of the difficulty.6.   We have carefully considered various proposals for strengthening the existing lav/ so as to enable theauthorities to  deal with the problem presented by processionsand concentrations of mavtbhers such as those which haverecently taken place.  The more important cf these proposals are     (a)  That the Secretary of State should be          empowered to prohibit the concentration of          persons, whether by processions or othersiee,          outside the areas in which they ordinarily reside          if he is satisfied either  that serious disorder          is likely to results or that abnormal demands          will be made on the Poor Lav authorities of  the          area in which or to which  the  concentration  or          procession is  to be directed.  Under this propos-          al processions could be dealt with at a distance          from the ir ob jective.     (b)  That the Secretary of State should be          empowered., on representations  from the locality          affected? to prohibit for  a limited period either          all processions or particular  processions within          that locality  if disorder  is likely to result.                            -3-
     (c) As alternatives to (a) and (b)  above, that the        Secretary of State should be empowered to prohibit        a concentration or procession designed or intended        for a definitely illegal purpose, for example, to        create or incite to public disorder or tumult, and        that the Local Authority should be empowered to        prohibit in cases where a concentration or pro-        cession is for a purpose not in itself unlawful,        but where owing to its magnitude or its locality,        or by the attraction to it of unruly elements, it        is likely to result in serious disorder, or to        entail abnormal demands upon Poor Law Authorities.        The organisers of a procession to be given the        right to make representations to the Local Authority        against any order made hy it.    (d)   That powers   should be conferred on Local        Authorities in England and Wales, and in country        areas in Scotland, to prohibit, regulate and control        concentrations or processions of such a nature as  to        cause serious obstruction to traffic or undue        demands to be made upon the Police Force, having        regard to the necessity for preventing dangerous        congestion in the streets of a tov/n or city.7.     On examination it appeared that these proposals were open to various objections.    The Attorney-General has informed us that in his opinion the existing provisions ofthe criminal lav/ go as far as is advisable in dealing withconcentrations or processions where there.is reasonableground to apprehend a breach of the peace, and that accordingly he considers that it v/ould be unwise to ask parliament to pass new legislation based on considerationssuch as the apprehension of  a breach of the peace.                           4.
8.     The question oi&apos; what authority should he  vestedwith any new statutory powers also presents  very greatdifficulty.   It would he an innovation for  the  Secretaryof State to exercise a jurisdiction in matters of public order in the absence of any grave general  emergency,and it might be more appropriate that any  powers whichmight be taken should be exercised by Magistrates sitting in Petty Sessions.    (if it were deemed sufficient to take powers covering the London area only, the  powers mightbe entrusted to the Bow Street Magistrate).   The mainadvantage of this alternative would be the removal of thematter from politics.    Magistrates are not  responsible to Parliament and cannot be put upon their defence there.       On the other hand it is thought that  the  public might feel more confidence if the proposed jurisdiction in what is really a central problem, were  part of theexecutive duties of the Secretary of State.   He alone would be in possession of the information, whethersecret or public, received from all parts  of the country,on which a judgment could be formed.9.     The Attorney-General has suggested  to us  that before resorting to new legislation, further trial shouldbe given to the procedure under an Act of  Edward III  bywhich a Court of summary jurisdiction may, upon  complaint,order anyone to enter into a recognizance  and findsureties to keep the peace or he of good behaviour.Considerable use has been made of this procedure inrecent years and it is reasonable to suppose that in  viewof the very serious disturbances which accompanied therecent concentration of hunger marchers in London, the
magistrates will be prepared to use their powers under thisStatute against the organisers and leaders of concentrationsand processions of similar character to those whichrecently invaded London.       It iss cf course, impossible to forecast the resultsof a more general recourse to this procedure, and it maybe found to work unsatisfactorily in practice owing, forexample, to the absence of uniformity of interpretationby  Courts of Summary Jurisdiction throughout the country.\ve recommend, however, that the attorney-Generalfssuggestion should be adopted on the understanding that ifthe further trial of this procedure proves unsuccessful,the question of strengthening the existing law v/ill bere considered.10.    We are informed that the existing powers relatingto matters such as the importation of funds destined forseditious purposes ana communist propaganda in the services have been found insufficient, and v/e propose, if the Cabinetso wish, to submit a further Report on these matters in due course.                 CONCLUSIONS- AND leCOHKBHDATIGIIS.11.    Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarisedas follows:-        (i) That before resorting to new legislation           further  trial should be given, to the procedure           by which a Court of Summary Jurisdiction may,           upon complaints order any person to enter into           a recognizance and find sureties to keep the           peace or be of good behaviour.       (ii) That if  this experiment proves unsuccessful           the question of strengthening the existing           law should be again considered.
-I OS)I. (.&apos; IO(iii)  That  the present  Committee should he      authorised to proceed v/ith the examination      of the existing powers relating to matters      such  as the importation of funds destined      for seditious purposesj and communist      propaganda in the Services.Signed on &quot;behalf of the CommitteeJOHN GILMOURChairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. ,      lutii December, 1932.
