                       (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP         h                     HIS BRITANNlO MAJESTY \ 5 GOglggTOTJ                                    CABINET.^nT3Tm                 PROGRAMME OP NEW CONSTRUCTION F6R 1933.P.  444/32.            -                    Memorandum by the First Lord  of the Admiralty.               Tho following  is  the New Construction Programme  which      I  ask  the  Cabinet to approve for inclusion  in the Navy Estimatee      for  1933.                    1  Cruiser (LEANDER Clans)                    3  small Cruisers  (ARETHU5A  Class)                    1  Leader  and 8 Destroyers.                    3  Submarines (one Minelayer Submarine  and                                  two  &apos;3&apos;  or Patrol type)                    3  Sloops  (one General  Service type.                               one Sloop Minesweeper,                               one Convoy Sloop)                    1  Special Service Vessel,                    3  small Vessels  (namely, one  Coastal Sloop,                                      one Boom Defence Vessel an^                                      one Sailing  Barque)               The Cruisers,  Destroyers and Submarines proposed to  be      laid down  constitute the fourth and  final instalment of  the Now      ConstructiLon Programme  due for  completion by  the 31st December      1936 under the term of the London Naval  Treaty.               The inclusion  of  4 Cruisers, instead of 3 as in      previous years,  is due  to  the unfortunate Inability  of tha j      Commonwealth Government to undertake the  construction of a      Cruiser to replace H.M.A.S. BRISBANE., which is  one of the      ships  due  for replacement  before  the 31st December 1936.               Aa Foreign Powers are  constructing 6&quot;  Cruisers  larger      than the LEANDERS and much more powerful  than the ARETHUSAS,      whilst ao  many  of our  existing  Cruisers are small vessels of      older  types, it  would have been far  preferable  to have laid      down 2 LEANDERS  and  2 ARETHUSAS in  this last  instalment.                                                            This ......
This would have given us IQ LEANDERS and 4 ARETHUSAS,  as was originally Intended In 1930.   Unfortunately,  the  tonntgeremaining out of our permissible 90,720 tons does  not  quiteadmit of this, and It is necessary therefore to accept9 LEANDERS and 5 ARETHUSAS, which will leave us 720 tonsshort of our Treaty allowance in under-age Cruisers on31st December 1936.         The numbers of Destroyers and Submarines  proposedto be laid down are the same as in previous building programmes since the Treaty,   I should point out  that,  even after the completion of these vessels, we shall be below our treaty allowances on the 31st December 1936 to the extent ofapproximately -         60,500 tons in under-age Destroyers          4,400 tons in under-age Submarines.This, of course, is without taking into account the question ofadditional Destroyer building under Article 21 of  the  Treaty(the Escalator clause).         As regards the smaller vessels, two of the Sloops areof types Included in previous New Construction Programmes.The Convoy Sloop and Coastal Sloop are of new and simple types and are in-tended for the protection of Merchant Shipping againstSubmarines.   When the designs have been tried out andstandardised, we shall be able, in the event of war, to make arrangements for increasing the numbers of these vesselsvery quickly.   The Sailing Barque Is proposed in order to test in a practical way the advantages of training in sail asa means of developing seamanlike qualities and morale.   Duringthe past year, it has become evident that there is a large bodyof experienced opinion both in the Navy and out of it whichholds that the Sailing Training Ship is the most efficient,and much the most economical, school for developing thosequalities.

         The Special Service Vessel is to replace H.M.S.TRIAD,which is now 23 years old, for service in the Persian Gulf.         It is proposed that the ships shall, as usual, bo orderedtowards the end of the financial year, with  the exception ofthe Sailing Barque, which will be ordered soriewhat earlier soas-, to he available for a cruise before the end of the summer of1934.   The provision required, on this basis, In the estimates for 1933 for starting the programme i3 only  50,000.         A financial statement showing the total estimated costof the Programme and the manner in which the expenditure would normally be spread ever the years of building Is attached.
