THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY  OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.      TRIPARTITE PREPARATORY TECHNJC;\L QCl^ISENCE         ON THE REDUCTION JDP HOURS G? LABOUR.        MEMORANDUM  BY  THE  MINISTER  CP  LABOUR     A Preparatory Technical Conference Is to he held at Genevafrom 10th January onwards, under the auspices of the InternationalLabour Office, to consider the subject of the reduction of weekly hours of labour by international agreement as a remedy for unemployment.    The subject has teen put on theagenda of the annual International Labour Conference to beheld in June and an atteirpt will he made at the PreparatoryConference to secure the adoption of a draft &quot;40-hour week&quot;Convention.     In the discussions that have led up to the position, wehave urged the necessity for closer and more realisticexamination of the pre clem before any attempt is made to framea Convention;  a Convention hastily improvised which fails toprovide satisfactorily for the very real difficulties which mustarise will not be ratified and will do more harm than good.   Wehave maintained  that a Preparatory Conference is not the best method of making progress and that it  is premature  to place the subject on the agenda of the Annual Conference before thePreparatory Conference has been held.   But  the decision to holda Preparatory Conference  having been  taken, we must take part and do what we can to secure that  the  proceedings are conducted with a due sense of  realities.     At the Conference  our representative  should oppose  the,*adoption  of any  draft Convention at this  stage and  should press for a thorough examination  of  the  possibility or otherwise  ofthe proposal  before  anything further  is  done.

Both employers and trade unions will &quot;be represented at the Preparatory Conference, and loth attach great importanceto the proceedings, from opposite points of view.    I havehad discussions v/ith representatives of the National confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations and of the T.U.C.    The former were opposed to any reduction of hours;  the latter press for sucha reduction hut only, as they informed me, on condition thatweekly earnings are not to he reduced.

         TRIPARTITE PREPARATORY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE.       Instructions to the British Governaent Delegate     The object of this Conference, as understood byH. M. Government, is to investigate the possibility of reducing unemployment by a reduction in weekly hours of labour,to be effected by international agreement,,   H. M. Governmentare anxious to adopt any practicable measures for reducingunemployment - this is indeed one of the main objects oftheir general policy - and they are therefore desirous of assisting in the fullest degree in the investigation to beundertaicen by the Preparatory Conference.   At the same time they wish it to be clearly understood that their attitudetowards any proposals that may emerge from the Conferencemust be determined by the extent to which such proposalsappear likely to be effective for the purpose towards whichthey should be directed, namely, the reduction of unemployment.The policy of H. M. Government in this respect was stated inthe House of Commons on 20th October as follows:-      &quot;Experience shews that an International Conventionregulating hours of labour will not be ratified by thecountries which are industrially important unless it can be so framed as to make-&apos; provision for the very real difficulties that must be encountered in its practical application.H. M. Government, therefore, while favouring a full examinationof the problem of reducing hours of work without reducing thestandard of living of the wage-earning population, have opposedany attempt to improvise a Convention which evades thedifficulties instead of solving them.   Such a Convention will beof no effect save to cause friction and misunderstanding andto delay the solution of the problem with which it professesto deal&quot;.                                                 /The
                                                           1 00     The action of H. M. Governments representative at theConference should he governed by the general considerations set out in the preceding paragraph.    One of his mainobjects should be to secure that all the practical difficultieswhich must be faced and overcome before any international agreement on this subject can become effective are broughtclearly and definitely before the Conference and he should oppose any proposals which v/ould have the effect of evadingrather than solving these difficulties.   In particular heshould emphasise the connection between hours an - wages andshould lay stress upon the point that however difficult it maybe to deal with wages in an international agreement it is most unlikely that such measures as those now in contemplation for reducing hours &quot;would become effective if the question of wagesis not regulated at the same time.    In pursuance of thispolicy he should oppose the suggestion contained, in the preliminastudy compiled by the Office of the I.L.O. which while proposing a Convention for reducing hours of work relegates the relatedquestion of wages to a Recommendation, which of  course willhave no binding force.   The points of detail to which attention should be called  are for the most part v/ell-knownfrom experience of the difficulties arising from the termsof the Washington Hours Convention:  specific mentionneed be made here only of the problem of regulating overtime,in such a manner as to be industrially practicable and yet notto defeat the  object of the proposals, which is that of reducing unemployment.
