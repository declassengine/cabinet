NOTE BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  INDIA.    When  the  Lord  Chancellor and  I circulated  on  30th July &quot; Proposals for a federal Constitution,&quot; 0.1. (32)  13, a further note on  certain aspects of &quot; FinancialSafeguards&quot; was promised.  I now circulate this note.   It  needs  to be carefullystudied, as it deals with one of the most difficult questions to be decided in connectionwith the Federal  Constitution.    INDIA  OFFICE,                                                       S. H.    10th August 1932.    The declaration by the Prime Minister on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s  Government atthe close of the first Round Table Conference, which has subsequently been reaffirmedand received the general endorsement of Parliament, contained the following passageregarding financial safeguards :        &quot; As regards finance,  the transfer of financial responsibility must necessarily     be subject to such conditions as will ensure  the fulfilment of  the obligations     incurred  under  the authority of the Secretary of State  and the maintenance     unimpaired  of  the financial stability and credit of India.   The Report of the     Federal Structure  Committee  indicates some  ways of dealing with this subject,     including a Reserve Bank, the service of loans and Exchange policy, which, in     the view  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have  to be provided for somehow in     the new  constitution.  It is  of  vital interest  to  all parties  in India to accept     these provisions, to  maintain financial confidence.  Subject  to these  provisions     the Indian  Government  would have full financial responsibility for  the methods     of raising revenue and for the  control of expenditure on non-reserved services.&quot;    2. The creation of a Reserve Bank on  a sure foundation and free from any political influence has always been one of the conditions deemed essential for the transfer ofIndian finance under safeguards&quot;8 to the control of a popularly appointed  Minister.Paragraph 20  of the Second Report of the Federal Structure Committee recognised thefact that it  might  be difficult in  existing conditions  to set  up a Reserve Bank of sufficient strength and equipped with the necessary  reserves, and  that, until this hadbeen done, it would be necessary to secure to the Governor-General, by some special provisions, adequate control over monetary policy and currency.    Unfortunately, this is the position with which we have to deal.   A Reserve Bankhas not been created and it is impossible to state when it will be possible to create it.    There must, therefore, be an interim period with  special provisions.   The financialadvisers to the Secretary of State, after giving  the matter their  fullest consideration^.came to the  conclusion that, until a Reserve Bank had  been established, the only hopeof maintaining  Indian  financial stability would be to appoint  during  the  interim period an official Finance Minister not responsible to the Legislature.    3. It was proposed in the first outline  Constitution (B.D.G. (31) S)  to link up  the interim period with the creation of a Reserve Bank  and to provide  that it shouldterminate  when  the  Bank was brought into being.   It cannot, however, be  too     * The safeguards contemplated are briefly summarised in the Appendix to this Memorandum.     1498    65  12.32
strongly emphasised that  the  successful operation of  a Reserve Bank to control the currency presupposes not  merely the  passage of the appropriate  legislation and the-acquisition of the necessary reserves, but also aud  this is vital the restoration ofthe general Indian financial position.  This in its  turn  postulates the clearing up ofthe  present  weaknesses in the  budgetary situation of  the  Central  and provincial governments and the reduction of the short term debt  in India and London tomanageable  and  safe  dimensions.   Unfortunately, we  are  far to-day from realisingthese  conditions,  which depend  largely on recovery from  the  world crisis and  the rehabilitation of  the price level.  Furthermore, before  the control of  Indian financeis transferred  to  a responsible  Finance Minister it  is  desirable that  the  reserve bank  should have justified  its  existence  by functioning satisfactorily for a briefperiod and should so  have  established confidence in  its  capacity  to discharge its responsibilities.    4.  If the Statute provided  for the transfer of responsibility on the creation of aReserve Bank, Indians  would inevitably demand its establishment before  the situation was ripe and the conditions essential for the successful functioning of the Bank wouldaiot  be appreciated.  For these reasons it is suggested in the present Proposals not tolink up the transfer of Indian finance to the specific event of the creation  of a reserve bank, but to leave it to be decided by Order in Council when financial control, undersafeguards, should be transferred to a Minister responsible to the Indian Legislature.   Looking at the matter from a broad point of view we have no hesitation  in statingthat the reservation of  finance is at the present  time of crisis necessary both in theinterests of  India and of this  country in order that the credit of  India may bemaintained at a period  of unparalleled difficulty.  It will be  readily appreciated  thatto transfer financial control  at, such  a time would be fraught with danger, and  thisconstitutes a  strong argument to persuade Indian opinion that  they should, in  theinterests of their country, acquiesce in  the postponement of the transfer of financial responsibility until conditions improve.  In proposing the  reservation of finance wehave not overlooked the difficulties which, in spite of the above considerations, will be involved.   5.  The first of these  is the disappointment which will be caused  in view of the expectations raised by the pledge quoted at the beginning of this memorandum andby the genei-al  trend  of  discussions at the Round Table Conference.   It has alwaysbeen understood  that  defence and foreign  relations  should,  so far as the IndianMinistry is concerned, be completely reserved to the Governor-General and shouldbe  outside their purview.    While  the  need  for  financial  safeguards  has been recognised  by Indians, though  not  by all,  it will undoubtedly  come  as a  shockthat finance should also be reserved.  Though, in practice, there  would  no  doubt be-continuous  consultation  between the officiLl  Finance Member and the responsible ministers, the constitutional  effect of the proposal to reserve finance would be that all aspects of finance would be legally outside the scope of the responsible  Ministry andwould be left  for the time   being, and, indeed,  for an undefined period, the  soleconcern of  the Goveivnor-General and  an  official Finance  Member acting under hisdirections.    6.  Secondly, the reservation of finance is likely to be represented by Indian criticsas tantamount to a denial of responsibility at the Centre.   It will be urged that financedominates all branches of administration and that if finance is reserved the scheme ofresponsibility with safeguards becomes a sham.  The  position of the official FinanceMember in relatiou to his colleagues, even if they are  induced to accept the scheme,is likely to be  one of great  delicacy.  Finance  pervades to  such an  extent the-activities of all Departments  that it would  be , exceedingly  difficult to work  thisscheme  unless there was willing co-operation  between the Finance Member and the-other  Ministers.   The scheme   bears  very marked similarity  to  dyarchy  in  theProvinces.   On the financial  side  at  least  dyarchy has  not  proved impracticable,but, as is explained in  the Simon Report, there were forces which tended to drive theMembers and Ministers to co-operate.   These forces centred round the existence of anofficial bloc in the Legislature whose votes  the Ministers were very anxious to secure.There will be no such official bloc in the proposed  new Federal Legislature.    7. We have, none  the  less, come to  the  conclusion  that,  judged by financial considerations alone, the reservation of finance oilers the  only adequate prospect ofmaintaining financial  stability until conditions favourable  for  the transfer  of financeunder safeguards to an Indian Minister have been established.  The next best coursewould be to reserve finance temporarily and to link up in the Constitution the question-of transfer  with the creation of a Reserve Bank and to provide that finance should be
transferred after a Reserve Bank  has been functioning for, say, 12 months.   But the risks in  adopting this course are  great, and it would  be necessary to make it clear toIndia that His Majesty&apos;s Government had  no intention of being stampeded into thecreation  of  a  Reserve Bank  before conditions  were  ripe.   This would  almost inevitably lead to political friction in the future.  Realising, however, the difficultiesof  treating finance as a  reserved  subject, we  only  reached our conclusions aftercarefully considering  whether any alternative scheme  could be  devised  which wouldenable a  responsible Finance Minister  to  be  appointed at the  inception of  the newConstitution.  We  have  accordingly examined  a plan  under which a responsibleFinance  Minister would  be appointed  while the  duties connected  with  currencycontrol  and  management and Ways  and Means would, pending the  creation of aReserve  Bank, be  vested  in a statutory Controller of Currency  responsible to theGovernor-General.  The scheme  assumes  that  the other safeguards regarding theGovernor-GeneraTs reserved powers and  the creation of a Financial  Adviser areapplied.    S. A somewhat similar scheme, based on the separation of the high finance side fromthe  budgetary side of Indian Government finance, was examined in a memorandum submitted  by the Secretary of State to the Cabinet in.October 1931  (R.T.C. (31) 9).The conclusion  of  this Memorandum,  which was  written by  the Controller of the currency in  India,  was &quot;that the difficulties of separating the high finance  side ofIndian Government from  the budgetary side are so great that  any attempt  to do so would be  found-to lie unworkable and  would in present  circumstances lead to a breakdown.&quot;    A variant of  this  scheme, under which a responsible Finance  Minister would beappointed  and the control of monetary policy and currency would be entrusted  to a currency  Board  under the  supervision of the  Governor-General, has  recently been examined by the  Government of India.   They point out that  the financial activities ofthe Government would be seriously affected by the operations of the Currency Board,over which it would have no control, while the Government on its side would impingeupon the Currency Board  with the result that  the latter might be  impeded in  thedischarge of their duties as regards the control of credit.  Their conclusion regardingthe  workability of the scheme  is  as follows: &quot;In  short,  there  would be so manypoiutsof contact  between an independent currency authority and the  Government that-the  currency authority would not be able to maintain  its independence  unless it had sufficient resources of its own, while the possibilities of friction between  the currencyauthority and the Government would be so great that the frequent intervention of theGovernor-General would probably be necessary.  The conclusion is, therefore,  thatmanagement of the currency by a Currency Board would not be a satisfactory methodof providing for  the interim period, and in fact that, pending the  establishment  of aReserve Bank, there  is  no  satisfactory alternative to leaving the administration of- currency and exchange in the hands of the Government.&quot;    9. On the other hand,  the Government of India consider that the attempt to transfergeneral  responsibility without  financial responsibility is likely to produce almostinsurmountable  difficulties in  the working  of a Constitution  framed on the general lines indicated by the Prime Minister at the  Round Table Conference.   The Govern- ment of India recognise, however, that the Reserve Bank cannot be brought into being unless substantial funds,  estimated at about  oO millions, can be provided from some- external source,  either hy the conversion of  a substantial  part of the  existing silver reserves into gold or the raising  of  money on  a  guarantee from His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  As these suggestions appear to us to be impracticable  of realisation we- do not pursue this aspect of the case further.     10. On the broad issue as to the workability of a scheme, under which the financial functions of the  Government would be divided between a responsible Finance Minister and a statutory Controller or Currency Board under the supervision of the Governor- General, we find  ourselves in  essential agreement with  the conclusions of  the Government of India and feel convinced that such  a  plan  would,  in  present  circum- stances, be productive of such constant friction  that  there would  be great  risk  of a breakdown.  It  may, however, be  asked why the scheme  should be  condemned if division of  financial functions between a responsible Finance Minister and a Reserve Bank is regarded not only as workable but as a sound practical plan.  Theoretically, there may appear to  be little difference between handing over the functions of currency control to a Reserve  Bank and handing them over to a statutory Currency Controller, but those who are  conversant with the  working  of Reserve Banks  and their relations with Government Treasuries will realise that there is  all the difference in  the world
between the two schemes.  A Reserve Bank, in  utilising its resources for the controlof credit and the maintenance of exchange, is disposing of  reserves that are its ownproperty and not the property of Government.  This, in itself, would serve to diminish the friction between the two authorities that would arise  if  a  statutory Controller of currency were utilising the reserves  of  Government for  the support of a policy to&quot;which the responsible Finance  Minister  was opposed.  The  authority attaching tothe Governor  of  an  independent Reserve  Bank  should  help him  to carry publicopinion with him  when  it might oppose, and  in  the circumstances of India would almost certainly oppose, similar action if taken by a statutory Controller of Currency.This officer, being an official, would in effect be  debarred  from the opportunities ofeducating and mobilising outside opinion which  would be open to  the Governor of anindependent Reserve Bank.   Psychological considerations thus enforce the practicalarguments which have led to  the general adoption of the system under which currencycontrol has been handed over to the management of independent Reserve. Banks.  InIndia we feel that  a division of functions, following the experience that lias provedsuccessful  in other countries, should work, whereas  a division of functions withinGovernment itself  would be  a source of continual discord  entailing the Governor-GeneraFs constant intervention.                                         ,   11. The Secretary of State&apos;s advisers, when formulating their scheme of safeguardsin association with a Reserve Bank, expressed the view that these safeguards could notbe regarded as a sure protection  against financial disaster, but rather as checks orbrakes that might  serve to limit or  delay it, and that  far  from weakening  them asdemanded by some of the Congress leaders it would be desirable, if it were possible,to strengthen them.  The plan for the creation of  a statutory  Controller of Currencyor Currency Board in lieu of a Reserve  Bank cannot be regarded as giving increasedstrength to the structure.   We remain, therefore, of the opinion that from thefinancial point  of  view the complete  reservation of finance pending the creation of aReserve Bank  is the only sound  course if there is  to be a fair chance of maintaining the credit of India  under the new dispensation.   12. For the reasons explained above  there would  be grave risk in linking up  thetransfer of financial responsibility  with the creation of  a Reserve Bank even if it werestipulated  that  the transfer  should  not  take  place   until the  Bank had  been insuccessful  operation for, say, 12 months.  In our  view the only satisfactory course-would be to retain a free hand to His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide when financial control under safeguards should be transferred.    Other plans for dividing the financialfunctions of Government between a responsible Minister and a  statutory Controller of currency or Currency Board can  be devised, but we wish to make it. clear that theseare alternatives which, on financial grounds, we cannot recommend.

The following is a brief summary of the financial safeguards included  in the draft constitution which would come into operation after finance has been transferred ;        (a) The Governor-General is  given  a  special  responsibility for &quot; tho safe-    guarding of the credit of the Federation,&quot; and, supported by the  advice of a    statutory  Financial Adviser, will have, in order  to  exercise this special responsi-    bility, the  power  of overriding the  advice of  the  responsible  Ministers  if    necessary,  of securing  the passage  of legislation by  certification (including    legislation for the  purpose of raising revenue) and  of  securing  supply.  (His    powers will extend to the supervision of borrowing.)

(c) The Budget   proposals  cannot  be  laid  before the  Legislature  by the    responsible Ministry without the approval of the Governor-General.       (d) No measure  affecting  currency  or exchange  may  be  introduced  into the    Legislature without the approval of the Governor-General.

The signatories of  this  Memorandum  wish at the  outset  to  emphasise thestatement, made in the Memorandum of the 17 th June  1931, which was repeated  inthe Memorandum of the 2nd  August 1932, that the financial  safeguards put forwardwere not to be regarded as a sure protection  against financial disaster,  but rather  as-checks or brakes that might  serve to limit or delay it, and that far from weakeningthem it would be desirable, if it were possible, to strengthen them.   2. Briefly, their view is that, if the Central Government is to be made responsible to the Legislature, it  is impossible to devise any financial safeguards w-hich couldconfidentby be relied upon to obtain the objectives specified in the Prime Ministers-Declaration of 19th January 1931, viz. to &quot; ensure the due fulfilment of the obligationsincurred  under  the  authority  of the  Secretary of  State and  the  maintenanceunimpaired  of  the financial  stability  and credit of India.&quot;   The  mere fact  that a constitutional change has taken place is bound to affect the credit of Tndia, especiallyin the present state of financial depression prevailing  in the world generally, and  allthat the writers of the Memoranda were able to  do was to frame a scheme, which,.assuming that it was decided  to set up  a responsible  Central  Government, would  intheir view afford the best chance of  averting a financial breakdown.   3. That scheme depended on the vesting of control of currencj^ and credit  in  anindependent  Reserve Bank,  the  appointment of  a Finaucial  Adviser  with  special responsibilities, and a reservation of certain special powers to the Governor-General.Pending the establishment of a Reserve Bank, the appointment of an  official finance minister (in other words, the  reservation of finance) was considered necessary in viewof the extent to which currency control and financial administration are interlocked.   4. It should be remembered  that  the scheme  was recommended in June 1931before the crisis had reached its present acute stage.  It would  in ottr view only  be-possible to  put the  permanent plan into operation  with a reasonable prospect  ofsuccess when economic and  financial  equilibrium in the world has been restored.The collapse in the  price level,  which  has been  exceptionally  severe in countriesproducing raw materials,  has completely upset the normal economy  of india.  the values of lndia&apos;s export trade have greatly shrank, with the result that the balance oftrade in private merchandise has  become adverse in the last few months  instead&apos;of exhibiting the normal large surplus.  The real weakuess of the position has beenconcealed by the exceptional  exports of gold.  It is, however, impossible to count  onthe indefinite continuance of  these exports,  which  have been the source  of the considerable  remittances obtained b3&apos; the Secretary of  State in recent months.   A lossof confidence in the stability  of the rupee would stop the outflow of gold and mightwell produce a reverse current  of  gold imports.   The restoration of the  Indianeconomic position is bound  up with the restoration of the world position, and until this  has been achieved the future remains obscure and must give cause for anxiety,whatever may be the constitutional position.    1338  65 12.32
    5. Much  still  remains to  be clone  before the creation of a Reserve Bank can be contemplated.   The  actual  shortage of reserves to-day is  in the neighbourhood of  30 millions.*  This shortage of gold  aud sterling assets  is only one-and  possibly not the most formidable obstacle to the establishment  of a Reserve Bank.  Before this  could be contemplated  it would  be essential  that  the  short-term indebtedness&apos;!&quot; should  be  reduced  materially and  that  a  substantial  recovery  from  the present. economic depression  should  have  taken place.   To establish  a Reserve Bank before these conditions were  satisfied would,  even under the  existing regime, be extremely hazardous, since there would be a risk that it would break down within a few months and  be obliged to  seek support from the Government.   To establish it at a time when, in addition to the above  difficulties, constitutional chauges are taking place  would be to invite disaster.    G. The  contingency has  therefore to  be faced that,  when the time comes for the inauguration of Federation, conditions  may not yet be  appropriate for the establish- ment of a Reserve  Bank ;  and the temporary reservation  of finance  was indicated in our previous  memoranda as, on  financial grounds, the  best way of dealing with  this situation.  Various plans  have been  suggested as  alternatives to this, and  these we now  examine.    (1) The President of the Board  of  Education has  suggested  that, in addition to &quot;the safeguards (a) to  (e) and (g) in paragraph  7  of  his Memorandum,  provision should be made that the Financial  Adviser should be  consulted  by the responsible Finance Minister upon day-to-day monetary  administration and  should  be   responsible for keeping  the  Governor-General informed  if  the  responsible Finance Minister  was acting  unwisely in this sphere, and  that  the Governor-General should  be  invested with powers to enforce  a correct policy.  This plan contemplates  that the Controller of Currency,  the officer  charged with day-to-day currency administration,  would be a subordinate of  the Finance Minister.  To enable the Financial Adviser to exercise his functions, it  would be  necessary that in all matters of any importance he should be informed of orders  which the  Finance Minister proposed  to issue to the Controller of Currency.  This, in a branch of  administration  where prompt  action  is necessary, would be prejudicial to efficiency, even if it did not prove completely unworkable. Moreover, it  would seem to  afford the  maximum scope for friction, as it is especially in this branch of administration that  a  conflict of  view  between the Finance  Minister and  the Financial Adviser would have to be anticipated.  It would not suffice to limit the Adviser&apos;s right to be  consulted to major questions ; for  serious trouble might easily occur as  the cumulative effect of faulty decisions each of which in itself might not seem of sufficient  magnitude to  justify the intervention of the Governor-General. If the Financial Adviser  found it necessary  to  intervene  frequently in  the details of currency management in  opposition  to  the Finance  Minister, the  prospects of his becoming the Ministers trusted adviser on  questions of general financial administration would be jeopardised.    (2) The Marquess of Lothian has put forward a scheme  under which there would be in the Cabinet a &quot;Finance Member of first-rate ability of the necessary competence and authority to argue on equal terms with the  responsible  Finauce  Minister.&quot;   The officer in question, it  is suggested,  should hold the  appointment of Revenue  Member    * This figure, which, owing to the increase in the  note circulation, is somewhat higher than it was 12 months ago, is calculated on the basis of the recommendations of  the Indian Currency Commission of 1925-6.  The shortage on this basis would be  less if the gold ( 33 millions, valued at par&apos;) at present held in the Gold  Standard and Paper Currency Reserves were revalued  in accordance with the present higher sterling  value  of  gold.  On the other hand, the percentage of gold and sterling assets  in the Reserve which was recommended  by the  Commission might, in the light of recent events, be considered no longer adequate.    f  Though some progress  has been made, during the last 12 months, in the reduction of  Indian -Government short-term indebtedness, the amount- outstanding remains largo.    The total maturities during the next six years are:             Sterling  debt                                     46 millions.            Rupee debt                                      Rs. 116 crores ( =  87 millions).    (Where a loan has  alternative dates for redemption, the latest has been, taken.)    The above figures relate only to the Central Government.   Further, they exclude :       Indian short-term  Treasury Bills  (amounts varying from time to time ; at present about Rs. 36 j        crores  ^. 27 millions) ;      Indian Railway Debentures  (about  7 millions) ;      The capital portion of Indian Railway Annuities (about  2 millions per annum).
and  be  entrusted with  the  administrative duty&apos;  of  collecting the customs and/orincome tax, while control of the Treasury, which would  include  monetary policy.\vould be  held   by  the   Finance Minister.    We understand  from  a subsequentexplanation given by Lord  Lothian that there would  be  no separate appointmentof Financial Adviser to the Government, but that the Revenue Member would act inthat capacity.  This  appears to contemplate an arrangement in  direct conflict  withthat proposed in  C.I. (32) 13 (paragraph 17, page 12), which is that the additionalMinisters appointed  to assist the Governor-General in the  administration of depart-ments under his own control arc not to be members of  the Cabinet  of Ministers andare only to be summoned to meetings  of the Council at  the Governor-GeneraPsdiscretion  wheir  matters  affecting their special departments are  under  discussion.The Revenue Member would be unable, therefore, to  discuss questions of  financial policy in the Council of Ministers unless special provision were made.   Apart  fromthis, we see considerable difficulty in providing that one of the official Ministers shouldbe kept in touch with work in the department of one of the responsible Ministers, andtmless this were done it would  not be possible  for the Revenue  Member to influencedecisions.   The  scheme,  moreover, does not meet the special  difficulty of ensuring that during the  transitional period pending the establishment of a Reserve  Bank a sound currency policy should be adopted.    We understand that Lord Lothian claims as an incidental advantage of this olanthat the funds  ueeessary for  the reserved services would  be secured.  We must,however, point out. that, unless the proceeds of the customs  and/or income  tax werehypothecated for this purpose and paid into a separate account at the  disposal of theRevenue Member (and  no-one has suggested such  an extreme measure), these headsof revenue, payable as they would be into the Government Treasury, which would beat the disposal of the Federal  Government, would be indistinguishable  from  otherreceipts.    For these reasons we cannot recommend this plan either as a permanent  arrange-ment or as a temporary measure during the transitional period.    (3) Sir  Malcolm Hailey in his paper doubts the  practical working of the system ofa Financial Adviser, and suggests that the Governor-General&apos;s powers should beexercised in the  event of  need on the advice of the Auditor-General, who would be equipped with a  competent expert in matters of high finance.   This involves anextension of  the  Auditor-GeneraVs functions in  a  manner inconsistent with thegeneral conception of his duties.  The  Auditor-General reviews expenditure ex postfacto and.is responsible for bringing to the notice of  the Legislature cases  in whichmoney has been spent without due authority or the canons of linancial propriety havebeen violated.  His functions are in no sense executive.  It would,  in our judgment,be fatal to the independent position of the Auditor-General  if  he  were dragged intothe political arena by being involved in  controversial  questions of executive policy.Moreover, it would be impossible as a  practical matter to vest in one individual the wide responsibilities that the Auditor-General must  in any case discharge  and theadditional duties of confidential adviser to the  Governor-General on high finance andwatch-dog  over the Finance Minister.    7.  There remains the scheme criticised in paragraphs 7 et seqq. of the Memorandumof 2nd August  1932, which contemplated the  appointment of a  Finance  Minister,subject to the vesting of  currency control and  the management of  Ways and Means-in  a statutory  controller of  Currency responsible  to the Governor-General, thisarrangement  being  associated  with  the other standard  safeguards, including theappointment of  a Financial Adviser.  This plan leaves the  day-to-day management of currency in  the  hands of  an official responsible  to the Governor-General, and provides two officers, viz.  the Controller of Currency and the  Financial  Adviser, as acounterpoise to a Finance Minister who might be disposed to  pursue unsound courses.The  scheme  oilers  more points of approximation to the Reserve Bank plan than any other, but differs from it fundamentally in that the reserves would continue to be the reserves of the Government and that control over the banking reserves of the country,and therefore  over credit policy, would not be exercised by the authority  responsiblefor  the  control of  the  currency.   In  paragraph 10 of the  Memorandum of the2nd August 1932, C.I. (32) 17,  the  view was expressed that such  a  plan would beproductive of  constant friction  and  that there  would  be grave  risk of a breakdown.To this opinion we adhere.    The  alternative  suggestion, similar  to  the  above,  but with  a statutory Currency,&apos;Board substituted  for a statutory Controller of Currency,  is open to the same
criticisms, with the added drawbacks that a Board would be less efficient and might-be more subject to political pressure.   8. We are thus forced to the conclusions :        (a) That  the establishment  of a  Reserve Bank is the only satisfactory method     of making the function of currency control independent of the Finance Minister,.     which has  always been  recognised  as one of the essential  conditions of the     transfer  of financial responsibility at the Centre ;  and that none of the alternative     schemes can be recommended as workable.       (b) That  a Reserve  Bank  cannot  be set up  until not  only  have  adecpiate-     reserves been  created, hut also the difficulties  of the  present  acute  economic     depression have been overcome and a material reduction been made in the short-     term debt.   9. It may be that, when the time arrives for bringing  into force the part of theAct conferring responsibility at the Centre, conditions will  have changed sufficiently to enable a Reserve Bank to be set up.   But it  would be unsafe to frame legislative proposals on  this assumption.  For the transitional period, the financial positionwould be safeguarded b3&apos;  deferring the  coming into force  of  the part of  the  bill relating to the Federal Government until  a  Reserve Bank  has been established  andis seen to be working satisfactorily.  If  this is  ruled  out,  the only alternative which seems to  us to offer a reasonable prospect  of security  is the temporary reservation of&quot;finance.                                                          it.

We have been instructed to consider the provisions that will be required  in  theBill to give effect to the provisional decision reached  by the Cabinet Committee at its-meeting  on  the 4th November.  Before making our recommendations it is perhapsdesirable, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that we  should state in  as precise terms as  possible what we understand that  decision to be.   The  Committee in the first place accepted without modification the &quot; normal &quot;safeguards which are summarised in the  Appendix  to C.I.  (32) 17,  and which  arealready   embodied  in  the  proposals  for  a Federal Constitution now before  theCommittee.   The Bill would  contain no provisions governing a transitional  period between  the establishment of Federation and the settipg up of  a Reserve  Bank,  buton the assumption that  a Reserve Bank would  be in existence on the establishmentof Federation would provide for a responsible Finance  Minister from the outset andfor the transfer of financial responsibility, subject to the &quot; normal &quot; safeguards.  TheBill would, however, contain a provision that the part of the Act setting up a federal government could not be brought  into operation until  a Resolution to this end hadbeen  adopted by  both  Houses.   The proposals for a Federal Constitution alread3rcontain such a provision.  But  at  the Conference and in Select Committee it  would,no doubt, be explained that Parliament would not be asked to pass such a Resolutionuntil  the general conditions Avere such that this part of the Act could be brought intoforce  without endangering the financial stability of India.   If this be a correct appreciation of the  provisional decision of the Committee wesuggest  that, in addition to the insertiou of  a clause in  the Bill providing thatFederation could not be established until  a Resolution to this end had been adoptedby both Houses, it would be desirable to work into some part of  the Bill a referenceto the fact that the Reserve Bank  would be entrusted  with the management  of  the currency.  This might  be done by  an amplification of clause 64A of the  proposals,which provides that no  legislative proposal affecting the  constitution of  a reserve bank may be introduced without the consent of the Governor-General.  It is  suggestedthat the  words  &quot;which under act of  the Indian Legislature  has been entrusted withthe control of the currency &quot; might be inserted after  &quot; Reserve Bank &quot; in section 64A.This  would indicate  clearly  that  a  Reserve Bank would  be in existence from  the outset.   Under this  scheme,  it follows  that  Reserve Bauk legislation will  have  to  beundertaken by the jn-esent Legislature and could not be deferred until the federal legislature has been set  up.   In  the  impending  discussions  it should be made clear that one,  though only one, of  the conditions precedent to the introduction of federation  is that a  Reserve Bank should be constituted on sound lines.   It would be well  that the main principles of  the Reserve Bank Bill  should be stated and ifpossible accepted by the Conference.  On the other hand, it is also desirable  that      1434    65  12.32
too much, stress should not be laid on the establishment of a Reserve Bank, lest theimpression be created  that this alone would stand in the way of the introduction of federation and that Parliament would  be asked to adopt the necessary Resolutionbringing the Act  into force as  soon as  a Reserve Bank had been established.  &quot;Inexplaining the conditions under which  Government would ask Parliament. to pass the Resolution, emphasis should, we suggest, be laid on the restoration of. normalconditions-financial,  economic,  and,  it may  be,  political  also.   Otherwise  the pressure to establish  a  Reserve Bank before  conditions  are favourable might bedifficult to resist.                                                              It. A.
