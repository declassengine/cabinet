THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the  Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.CP.  404 (32).CABINET.THE LYTTON  REPORT.  JAPAN  AND  THE  LEAGUE  OF NATIONS.    1.   THE  Lytton  Commission,  appointed  by  a  Resolution,  dated  the10th December, 1931, of the Council of the League, has presented a unanimousReport, which comes before the Council (under the Presidency of Mr. de Valera)on the 21st November.  The Report is unanimous, being signed by the American,French, German and Italian members, as well as by the Chairman.  It is dividedinto ten chapters, the first eight of which deal with matters of history and fact.while Chapter IX is entitled  Principles and Conditions of  Settlement&quot; and chapter X *&apos; Considerations and Suggestions to the Council.&quot; Japan applied for,and was given, time to prepare observations  on  the contents of the Report andthese observations are  being circulated before the Council meets.  It  may  beassumed that  they will strongly  challenge the conclusions  of the Commission.On the other  hand,  as the  representatives of five  nations, after hearing bothsides and visiting the ground, are in agreement on the Report, it is difficult to suppose that the  Council will reject its findings.  As  regards the recommenda-tions of the Report, these J^ake the form of suggestions to^China and Japan e.g., the granting by the Government&quot; of &quot;China of autonomy &quot;to &quot;Manchuria, the negotiation of a Sino-Japanese Treaty providing for  Japan&apos;s special interests,&amp;c. rather than  of  explicit advice to  the Council of  the League as to what itshould decide to do.  But the deliberations of the Council, in view of the  attitude taken up by Japan,  are not unlikely to result in a  serious situation, and I feelthat I  should  place before the Cabinet some information about it and  indicate the course of action  which may have to be taken.     2.   I will not trouble the Cabinet  with questions of procedure :  the compli-cation  arises because there are three bodies (i) the Council, (ii)  the Committeeof Nineteen, appointed by the Assembly, and (iii) the Assembly itself,  all  ofwhom will have something to say.  The Report  is  made to the first named, andit  would be possible for  the Council to pass the matter over  to  the Committeeof Nineteen forthwith.  But before this happens  the Japanese  representative,Mr. Matsuoka. who has been sent  specially from Tokio,  will present the Japanesecase to the Council and, no doubt, the Chinese representative will reply.   after that everything  is  uncertain.  Sooner or  later the  Committee of Nineteen,presided over by M.  ILymans, will take the matter  in hand and will  presumablyframe  a  Resolution which  will be recommended  to the  Assembly  for  its acceptance.  The  presence of a majority of small States and the very successfulpropaganda conducted  by the Chinese representative constitute conditions underwhich things are  likely to go unfavourably to Japan in  the Assembly.     3.  . The first  question is whether the Council should approve the Report, or at any rate the first eight chapters which contain conclusions of fact.    Thesechapters give an  admirable  account  of the  quite  unique  character  of  theManchurian controversy, and lay stress on the shortcomings of  China, and of theabsence of any settled  government as a contributory  cause of the Manchuriantrouble.  They also recognise fully the special interests of Japan  in Manchuria,e.g., in connection with the South Manchurian Railway  which Japan acquiredfrom Russia.  But the authors of the  Report are unanimously of opinion that      6612   [7884]Copy  No.   55
the explanation put forward by Japan for starting military operations, viz:, the. -alleged blowing; up i by-, the -Chinese: of.- the. railway line, is not at sufficient &apos;j ustifiea-&apos;.;tion for its military activities in  Manchuria during the past yeai&quot;, and,^indeed,the Report throws grave doubt on the Japanese version of  the  incident.  Also.the Report reaches the conclusion  that the creation of Manchukuo was not due tothe spontaneous action of Manchurian  inhabitants, but was due to the organisedintervention of Japan.  As T have  said,  I do not see how the Council of the Leaguecan  be expected to do  other than  accept the unanimous  Report  of its  ownCommission who have investigated matters on  the spot, and  I should expect this to be the first decision reached at  Geneva.     4.  But this decision, however natural in itself, brings in its train some veryserious consequences.  If the  Commission^ findings of fact are accepted. Japanappears to be  responsible for a disregard of the Nine-Power Treaty, by the termsof which she, along with the other signatories, was bound to respect the  integrity of China.  This, of course, is Mr.  Stimson&apos;s view.  If the truth is that Japan hasdeliberately promoted the creation of the new Manchurian State, and has followedthis up by recognising it. it is natural to contend that she has broken the Treaty.There will be those on the Council who will also  contend that, on these findings,Japan has disregarded the Covenant, alleging that she has resorted to war without taking the preliminary steps to  resolve  her  controversy  with  the  Chineseauthorities which the Covenant provides.  The authors of the Report appear todesire to ward off this latter conclusion by an important paragraph in Chapter IX,Avhich runs as follows :       ,  &quot; It must be apparent to every reader of the preceding chapters that  the  issues    involved in this conflict are not as simple as they  are often represented to be.  They are.    on  the  contrary,  exceedingly   complicated,  and  only  an   intimate  knowledge of    all the  facts, as well as of this historical background, should  entitle anyone  to express    a definite opinion upon  them.  This is not a case  in which one country has declared war    on another country  without  previously exhausting the opportunities for  conciliation    provided in the  Covenant of the League of Nations.  Neither is  it a  simple  case of the    violation of the  frontier of one country  by  the armed forces of a neighbouring country,    because in  Manchuria thei-e are many features without an exact  parallel in  other parts    of the  world.&quot;*     5.  None the less, the League organs which are considering the matter will find it very difficult not to pronounce what amounts to a condemnation  of Japan.Yet this may produce some very  embarrassing, and even dangerous, results, for mr. Matsuoka, the Japanese delegate, has recently told me that if the Leaguearrives at conclusions which  conflict with Japan&apos;s sense of dignity, Japan  will leave the  League.  Apart from the deterioration of relations with Japan whichthis might imply,  Japan &apos;s withdrawal would  be especially regrettable, becausethe  opportunities  of  contact  with and influence  over her  would  be  seriouslylessened.   I do not for a moment imagine that Japan  wants to leave the League,and there may be a considerable element of bluff in the warning I have received,but it makes it very necessary to act with extreme caution.     6.  Another issue which is likely to be raised is that of a League declarationrefusing to recognise the acceptance of the State of Manchukuo.   Last March theLeague,  endeavouring  to  put itself  in  line with  Mr.  Stimson,  adopted  aResolution :          &quot; That it is incumbent upon the  members of the League of Nations not to recognise    any situation. Treaty or Agreement which  may be  brought about by means contrary to    -the Covenant of the League of Nations or to the Pact of Paris.&quot;That, however, was an abstract  declaration,  whei&apos;eas the attempt will now bemade from some  quarters  to apply  it specifically  to  the findings of the LyttonReport.   Recognition is not a right  which any new  State may claim; it  is  aprivilege which existing States  may confer on the newcomer.  But it is also  aconvenience to both sides, and I  should hesitate very much,  whatever may be therights and wrongs of the origin of Manchukuo, to pledge the British Governmentto all eternity never to recognise the new State  if it becomes definitely established,notwithstanding its illegitimate  origin.   At any rate, indefinite non-recognition* lytton Report, p. 121!.
                                     3is a.practical, poiiey&apos;only if all other; States, do the same, and  there are Statesoutside .fche [league .interested in tradevwith Maiiehukuo who would not1 be bound by a League; Resolution.       T :-I I*! -  ;!&apos;;;-      ...  - n;/b N; NI-NIITII -;M -II.MI;    7.  Lastly, there is the  question  whether there is anything which the Leaguecan properly do or suggest to promote a reconciliation  between China and Japanor to establish a compromise in regard  to Manchuria.   It has been suggested that though the League  can do nothing directly, it might invite the  Powers withspecial interests in the Pacific (including  the United  States,  Soviet Russia andGermany) to organise a Conference  to consider the future of Manchuria.  Thisis much the kind of  proceeding which is  contemplated in the Nine-Power treaty in case of  trouble arising  affecting China and involving the Pacific  Powers.While there may  be no objection  to this course in principle, I am disposed tothink  that Japan will decline to have anything to do with it on the ground.thatshe has done nothing wrong and that  there  is nothing to  investigate, and, Isuspect that the United States would  much prefer to disclaim  responsibility byleaving the League of Nations to grasp  the nettle itself and  then bewailing, theineffectiveness of Geneva if a League of  Nations solution is not forthcoming.  ...    8.   In  these difficult circumstances  it seems to me that British policy mustkeep in mind the following desiderata; though it will be difficult to pursue the mall at the same time.  We ought to act as a  loyal member of the League and avoid,as far as possible, bringing down on ourselves the condemnation which would,attach to isolated or prominent individual action.  It is impossible to abandonloyalty to the League and its principles merely because Japan  would prefer this :we must explain to Japan that the course  we  take is pro  League and  riotanti Japan. Even if other  considerations  did not compel this course, we have to remember the serious consequences to our trade of antagonising China.  In fact,we must strive to be fair to both sides.   But we must not involve ourselves introuble with Japan.                                                     (Initialled)      J. S.Genera, November 19, 1932.
