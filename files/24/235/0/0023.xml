[This Document is  the  Property of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1932.SECRET.                                                  Copy No........u.^CP. 423 (32).                                                                 /                                  CABINET.Burma; the  present Position with regard to Federation.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR INDIA.   It will he remembered that the Government statement on 12th January at the endof the Burma Itound Table  Conference began by stating that &quot;if and when they aresatisfied  that the  desire of the people  of  Burma is  that  the  government of  theircountry should  be separated from  that of India, His Majesty&apos;s  Government areprepared to take steps,  subject to  the approval of Parliament,  to separate  Burma &quot;and grant her a constitution such  as the Prime Minister then proceeded to outline.Later on in the statement  the Prime Minister  observed that  an  election  for theProvincial Legislative Council had to  be  held before  the  end of this  year and suggested that the  decision  of the people of  Burma, whether or not they are in favourof separation from  India, might  be taken after  a general election at which the broadissue had  been placed before the electorate.  Consequently  at the election which washeld in Burma on the 9th November last it  was  intended that the main  issue  shouldhe that of separation from or federation with India.  It was indicated by the PrimeMinister on 12th January and stated by myself  in the plainest terms on 27th June inthe House of Commons that the issue  lay between,  on the one hand, Separation,with a constitution as outlined by the Prime Minister, and, on the other, remaining a province of British India, and subsequently entering the projected Indian federation on the same terms as any other Province.   Accordingly the bulk of the 220 or more candidates for  the SO elected  seats inthe Burma Council ranged  themselves under the Separationist  or Anti-Separationiststandard.   The result of the election came as a complete surprise, not only to the Government,.but also  to  Burman political leaders, whether  Separationists or Anti-Separationists.Ten  days or  so before polling day Governments information was  that  61 con-stituencies were practically  certain  to  return  Separationist members; it was not until  three or four days before tho poll that the Burman  Separationist leaders had any  misgivings  as  to  the  outcome of the election ;  their only preoccupation was whether, of  the Separationist  group/the  People&apos;s Party  (purely  Burman,  and in opposition  to Government tinder  dyarchy)  or  the  Independent  Party  (Burman,.European, Anglo-Indian and Chinese;  supporters  of  Government under  dyarchy)would command a sufficient  proportion of the majority to  be able to take office.Less  than  a  week before  the poll  the leader of the  largest party  in  the  Anti-Separationist group had no hope that more than 15 Anti-Separationists at  the most-would be returned.   Actually, 44 Anti-Separationists of  one party or  another were returned  ami29 Separationists,  while seven members proclaimed themselves neutral on the main issue.  These seven include the members for the Indian coustituencies  who hadreceived  instructions from  India not to vote in the Council for an Anti-Separationmotion (which is,  of course, the natural  tendency of Indians)  unless it were certainthat at least 25 Burman members  of the  Council would also  vote that way.   Thefact that on these instructions Indians stood as neutrals on the Separation issue showsthat they had as  little expectation as any others of   the result that was  achieved.Yet  it is increasingly  clear that  the  main  cause of  the surprising  result of theelection was Indian influence brought to bear on the Burman electorate in two ways.!Anti-Separationist  politicians in  Burma  (except, of  course,  the  Indians)  belcugwithout exception to one or other G.C.B.A.  (General Council of Burmese Associations).These G.C.B.A.&apos;s are traditionally &quot; agin the Government,&quot;  particularly  government under dyarchy.  For many years they have been  in liaison with Congress in  Indiaand  under the inspiration of Congress they have  been opposed to separation from indian the belief that separation is the fixed policy of  the  British Government,  designed,for  &quot;Imperialistic&quot; purposes,  to bring  Burma  into  more complete  subserviencethan would  be her lot as an Indian province.  Relying on the  promises of the Indian1514    GO  12.32
Congress (openly made in resolutions passed  by the Karachi  Congress) the Anti-Separatioihsts have clung (despite  the  Burma  Conference  by which one  prominentG.O.B.A.  leader  was converted to Separatism he has failed  to  get  elected and despite the categorical statements of the Prime Minister and myself  to  the contrary)to the belief that, if Burma enters the Indian Federation, she cau do so on speciallyfavourable terms,  can  leave it  whenever  she  wishes  and,  by  doing so whenthe Indian Federation  has nearly attained  &quot; Dominion  Status,&quot;  will  be able  to start  her  own independent career practically with the status of  a Dominion.  This isthe general  attitude of all Anti-Separatiouist  leaders.   There are,  however, twoG.C.B.A.S in  particular whose natural opposition to  Government goes  much further than  that of the rest ;  they are the G.O.B.A.S presided over by U Chit Hlaing andU Soe Them.   They are in  particularly close connection  with  the  younger and politically-minded Pongyis (yellow robed Buddhist  priests  or  monks).    On thesetwo leaders and their  G.C.B.A.S Indian influence of a rather different, order has beenbrought to bear.  As my colleagues know, one of the ambitious of the more extremelynationalistic Indians is to  reserve India&apos;s coastal trade to  purely Indian control.   Atpresent by far the most important and  profitable  branch of Iudia&apos;s coastal trade isthat between  continental India and  Burma.  If Burma were separated from Indiaone consequence would be that that  trade would cease to be  coastal  ; and there is,I understand, ample evidence that Mr. S. JS&apos;. Haji, who sponsored the Indian coastal trade Reservation Bill  in the Indian Assembly some  years ago aud  is now managing director in Burma of the Scindia Steam Navigation  Company,  is fully  aware of  thisconsequence  and has spared neither trouble nor expense to prevent it from becoming a fact.    To cut short what might be a long account of the various devices  and machinationsemployed, the two  G.C.B.A.S I have mentioned, well supplied with Indian money,mobilised the Pongyis, who are debarred  by the rules of their order from taking partin politics (though  these rules are increasingly disregarded by the younger monks)and are in the main utterly ignorant in political matters, but  have a.most completehold over the villagers a  hold probably even greater  and more thorough than thatexercised by the Parish Priests over  the rural population in pre-war  Ireland.   ThePongyis were &quot; stuffed &quot; by the emissaries  of U Chit  Hlaing  and U Soe Thein withthe most incredible tales as to  the  effect  of Separation  on their order and on  theBuddhist religion.  They were  stampeded,  and in turn stampeded  the villagers,whom the Pongyis, for the  most part out  of  sheer innocent  credulity rather thanmalice, terrified by the stories which had  been retailed  to them  of  the increased taxation and  the interference with the villagers&apos; daily life and social  and domestichabits which Separation would  bring in its train.   When polling day came theydrove the  terrified villagers, in thousands, on pain of  ex-communication, to vote forthe  Anti-Separationist candidate whatever particular  party   he  might  belong  to.Nearly double the number of votes cast  in  any previous election were polled on this occasion and, contrary to  all expectations, the  Anti-Separationists, whether of ChitHlaing.&apos;s party or another, have won a handsome victory.  In actual fact the largest partyamongst the Anti-Separations is that led by Dr. Ba Maw, which may be described asthe more orthodox  Anti-Separationist party, drawing  its  inspiration from Congressdoctrines rather than from commercial Indian influence.    The  election has been a farce so far as it might serve as  an  indication of  thedesire of the people of Burma ; that  is quite clear.   It  is  no less clear that whateverelse the electorate  of  Burma  may have voted  about, they  have  not, by their votes inthe election,  satisfied His Majesty&apos;s Government that it is their desire that the govern-ment of their country should be  separated  from that  of  India.  Unfortunately theyhave equally failed to show that it is really  their desire to  enter  an Indian federation.&apos;    His  Majesty&apos;s Government  did not,  of  course, ever  intend to take the electionresults themselves as the final register of the decision of  the Burman  people on  theissue of Separation or Federation ; their intention has been to await a formal resolution by the Council  elected  on this issue.   It is, however, not very likely that  the council will be able  to record a clear decision, at any rate for some time.    Of the 44 Anti-Separationist  members the greater number follow^ Dr. Ba Maw. Since the election he has made it  quito clear  to the Governor in conversation that he is not opposed to Separation on principle ; he wants Separation, but he wants with  ita more liberal constitution than  that outlined by  the Prime Minister.   If he cannot get this (and the constitution outlined is as liberal as is possible) then,  relying on  the promises of  Congress, he would go into the Federation, but only for a time and  onlyon special conditions which, quite apart from the right to secede at will, are a negation
of federation,  lie lias tabled a motion for debate on 12th December and succeedingdays which is worth reporting,   lie opposes Separation on the basis of the constitutionoffered, and demands  that all  &quot;reserved subjects M be transferred to popular controlwithin a &quot;reasonable&quot;  and  specified  period; failing these  improvements  of theconstitution he recommends entry into the India U Federation subject to (i) the  rightto seceile at will; (ii) financial adjustments between India and  Burma suitable to burma&apos;s  peculiar  circumstances, and (iii) revision of  the proposed distribution of.Central and Provincial functions in the Indian Constitution so as to provincialise, for burma&apos;s benefit, additional subjects.   (What is in mind here is, inter alia, that Burmashould have  her own  Burman  Army, even in  the Federation.)  The motion  furtherdemands for Burma special facilities of acquiring experience of federal and reservedsubjects.   [J Chit Hlamgs party are committed to the Indians to  the  extent&apos; that theypositively wish  to enter the Indian Federation ; but they also wish to enter it only fora time and only on conditions  which  no self-respecting Indian advocate of Federationcould concede,  if it lay with him to concede them.  In the motion  which they have put in they  demand a  conference between  Burmans  and Indians to  settle  these terms, which  by  all accounts are   too  extravagant to  stand detailed exposition.(Q Chit Hlaing himself, I should  mention, has  been  elected &quot; Speaker&quot;  of the new council.   As he has hitherto been a consistent non-co-operator  and  has never sat inany Council, and as, moreover, he is clearly far from being unbiassed, his performance of the duties of the^Chair is quite likely to be  a factor of some  importance in the waythe debate on  the separation question  is conducted ;  it  is not impossible that theconduct of the debate may  develop some novelties, if not crises.)   Of the Separatiouist group, the People&apos;s Party, which is&apos; thoroughly Burman, showan inclination to flirt  with  Dr. Ba Maw&apos;s plan of trying to  squeeze  further concessionsout of the British Government  as  a  condition  of  Separation.   This party  firmlybelieves in Separation, but  it wants with Separation &quot;  Dominion Status &quot;  expressed ina constitution modelled  on that of the Irish Free State.  It accepted the constitutionoutlined after the Burma Conference only as  a suitable basis for further negotiationswith  His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   They have tabled a  motion   typical  of  thisstandpoint.   The Independent Party are  in  favour  of Separation  and  would  accept theconstitution offered as affording all, and more than.all,  that Burma could expect or isfit for.  Unfortunately  this party is  a  heterogenous collection of oddments andcommands no support except in  a few urban areas.   They have, however, put in  a motion accepting Separation on the terms offered.   To put the  position as summarily as possible, the people  of Burma have beenasked to  choose  between two clearly stated alternatives.   Of the four main parties into which their  representatives fall, only one,  and  that  the least representative,  isprepared  definitely to choose either  of these two alternatives.  The other three allwish  to  choose something each something  different from the other which is notoffered.  There  is indeed  a fifth group the six or seven who posed as neutrals inthe election ;  they are Indians  and would certainly vote for unconditional entry intothe Indian Federation,  but they do not represent Burman feeling at all, but only thefeeling of Indians in Burma.   I  think it is not wholly  inconceivable that after sufficient debate in  the  Counciland   after it  has  been sufficiently  often  and  emphatically  stated that the  onlyalternatives are  Separation on the  basis of the constitution outlined on the 12thJanuary  and unconditional entry into Indian  Federation, the majority of the membersof the Council could be convinced that their proper course is to accept Separation onthe terms offered ;  but I  do  not think that they could be  induced to express this opinion publicly for some time.  Most of  them  have probably bound themselves byoaths to  the Pongyis  to vote  against Separation, and until they are absolved  fromtheir oaths  by  their Pongyis they will not  dare to take  another line publicly.To convince the  Pongyis  will  take  time ;  and if the  debate on  Separation  whichbegins on 12th  December  is  brought to the point of vote, it is unlikely  that any definite and  unconditional choice between Separation or Federation will be recorded.If unlimited time were  at  our disposal  it  might be  possible  to wait until theCouncil  could  not  only  clear  their  own  minds  but also those  of  the   Pongyisand  the  villagers too; hut  so  long  as it  is uncertain whether  or  not Burma isto become a unit of the  Indian Federation it is impossible  to conclude  the task of  filling in   the  details of  the  Indian Federal  Constitution.  The  inclusion  or-exclusion of Burma has obviously an important bearing on Federal Finance,  and not
only on  the composition of the  Federal Legislature,  but on  the proportions of seats in the two Chambers to be allotted as between the States and British India, andas between  the various communities  on the British Indian side.  Unless, therefore,progress with the Indian Constitution is held up by intrinsic difficulties, it will become necessary to reach a decision within a month or so on the question of the inclusion orexclusion of Burma ; and if the Burmans cannot make the decision themselves,  it will eventually become  the  duty of the British Government  to  make the  decision.  Butevidently it will be most dangerous to do so in the  immediate future.   In the face ofthe result of the election, it would not be possible  for the British Government to saythat, they are  satisfied  that the people desire to separate from India; and tolnfposesuch  a decision  would, I am told, and readily believe, probably involve  rebellion in upper Burma at any rate.   Nor, on the other hand, is it possible for  the BritishGovernment,  knowing as they  do what the real views of the Anti-Separationists are,.to decide that it  is really the desire of the people  of Burma  to enter  the IndianFederation unconditionally.  Were a decision in this sense taken,  and were the peopleof Burma to discover, as they shortly would, how they  have  been   deceived, the result would be, in  the first  place, anti-Indian  riots (which, as  experience shows, are verymurderous affairs),  and at a subsequent stage  a demand  for the revision of the wholequestion.   At the present moment the only course open seems to be to wait for as long as wecan afford to wait, and  to  use  every endeavour to  educate the members  of  the new council  and  through  them  the Pongyis  (who are  the really dominant influence in..Burma) and the rural population  in what direction their interests  really lie.                                                                         S. II.       India Office,  12th December 1932.
