SECRET.C P  409 (38)                                           COPY NO._^     -----               CABINET.                    COMMITTEE  ON HOUSING POLICY.                      REPORT.1.   At their Meeting on November 23rd (Cabinet 62(32)Conclusion 9), the Cabinet agreed inter alia that memoranda on Housing Policy by the Minister of Health (Paper CP.  386(32)) and the Secretary of State for Scotland, should bereferred in the first instance to a Cabinet Committee composedef -               The Minister of Health               The Chancellor of the Exchequer               The Secretary of State for Dominien Affairs               The Secretary of State for Scotland.2.   w*e have considered these Memoranda, and have reached thefollowing conclusions in regard to England and fifales and scotland respectively.                 ENGLAND AND WALES.      The Minister of Health&apos;s proposals in Paper C0Po386(32)may be summarised as follows -   1. The early introduction of legislation determining      subsidy under the Housing (Financial Provisions)  Act,      1924 and the Housing (Rural Authorities) Act, 1931,   2. The opening of negotiations with the Building      Societies and the Local Authorities on the lines      indicated in paragraph 1 (iii) of C.P. 386 (32)      and the early introduction of authorising      legislation.   3. The consolidation of subsidy under the Housing Acts      of 1919,  1923 and 1924.   4. The concentration of State aid for housing on slum      clearance.    The subsidy for slum clearance to be  ue-      tained for the time being at the existing figure  in      order to encourage local authorities to transfer  their      housing energies to. this service.   This is estimated      to involve an acceleration of annual commitment      under the Act of 1930 of  75,000.   5. The continuance of the subsidy towards the cost of      re-conditioning rural cottages under the Housing (Rural      Workers)  Acts, 1926 and 1931.
3o   With regard to (2) above, the main proposal made bythe Building Societies is that a scheme should beauthorised under which they would advance 90 per cent, ofthe valuation of houses erected by builders, subject to athree-party guarantee (to be shared between the Exchequer,the local authority and tie Building Society) of thedifference between this percentage and the percentage(70 per cent.) which would normally be advanced by theBuilding Society under its rules.  We recommend (1) that inthe proposed negotiations with the Building Societies, theMinistry of Health should endeavour to secure the most favourable terms as regards rates of interest and period of replacement for loans advanced by the Societies for the building of working class houses;  and (2) that any Exchequer guarantee should be conditional on the rate of interest and period ofthe loan being approved by the Treasury.                      SCOTLAND o4.    The Secretary of State for Scotland has informed us that he is in general agreement with the views expressed inthe Minister of Health&apos;s Memorandum as to the desirabilityof withdrawing housing subsidies whenever it is possible todo so, but has suggested certain modifications to meetspecial circumstances in Scotland in regard to housing.  TheSecretary of State&apos;s proposals may be summarised as follows:-      (a) Negotiation with the Building Societies and Local          Authorities as contemplated in England and Wales;      (b) The introduction of legislation -          (i) terminating subsidy under the Acts of              1923 and 1931.          (ii) terminating subsidy under the Act of 1924              so far as payable  to private builders,  and              reducing subsidy to local authorities under              that Act to a sum  of  4 ( 5c10/- in rural              areas) - the reduced subsidy to  continue              for a period of two years;  (the foregoing              to be subject to the understanding that,              in practice, the subsidy will be made              available only  in  respect of houses              erected for the abatement of over-
crowding and for the a accommodation  of  lowwage earners);   and   (iii) facilitating the sale and the  letting at        a higher rent of houses erected under the        Act of 1919, if on further investigation        such action is found to be practicable.5.      Having regard to the fact that  throughout  theperiod of the reduction of Housing subsidies Scotland  hasalways remained a step behind England and Wales, we thinkthat the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal  to continue for aperiod of two years a reduced subsidy to local authorities under the Act of 1924 can be justified, but we have pointed out that, if the two countries are to be kept  instep, the termination of the subsidy in England and wales should mean a subsidy in Scotland, not  of  4 but of  1.10.0 .Moreover we are informed that local authorities inScotland, either now or in the near future, should be  ableto produce houses at an all-in cost ranging from  300  to 325.   We think that it would be most  difficult tojustify a subsidy as high as  4 in Scotland, and we have requested the Secretary of State for Scotland to confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to agreement being reached on the amount of the reducedsubsidy to be paid for a period of two years to localauthorities in Scotland under the Act of 1924.We recommend the Cabinet:-(l)  That as regards England and Wales the  Minister     of Health should be authorised:-     (a) to negotiate with the Building Societies         and the Local Authorities on the lines         indicated in paragraph 1 (iii) of         CP. 386 (32), on the understanding:-         (i) that in the proposed negotiations             with the Building Societies, the             Ministry of Health should endeavour to             secure the most favourable terms as             regards rates of interest and period             of replacement for loans advanced by             the Societies for the building of             working-class houses;        (il) that any Exchequer guarantee should be             conditional on the rate  of interest             and period of the loan being approved            -by the Treasury.
    (b)   To introduce legislation for termlJi2rting         subsidy under the Acts of&apos; 1924 and 1951 and for         authorising arrangements on the lines indicated         in paragraph 1 (ill) of C0P. 586 (52),    (c)   To proceed with the consolidation of subsidy         under the Housing Acts of 1919, i923 and 19240(2) That, with a view to the proposed Housing Bill    receiving a Second Reading before the Christmas    Rece3s, the Minister of Health should he authorised.    to introduce the Bill in the House of Commons early    in December in the form approved by the Committee    of Home Affair3*(5) Tiiat as regards Scotland, the Secretary of State    for Scotland shoxiid bo authorised to proceed on    the lines proposed, by him (see paragraph 4 above)    subject to agreement being reached with the    Chancellor of the Exchequer on the  amount of    the reduced subsidy to local authorities in    Scotland under the Act of 1924, during a period    of two years, and subject also to the application    of (l) (a) (l) and (ii) above to the negotiations    in Scotland, with the Building Societies and Local    AuthorltieSo3igned on behalf of the Committee         E0 HILTON YOUNG              CHAIRMAN o2, Whitehall Gardens, SJIoL      25th November, 1952*
