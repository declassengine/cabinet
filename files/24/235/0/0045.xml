Summary  of Reports.... submit ted, by jiembers of the Board            of  Trade Advisory Council.&quot; ITsiiPplementea in some             cases with information from&quot;other sources).        Employment -  On  the 21st November the total number of   persons  on  the registers of employment exchanges in Great Britain   was nearly  2,800,000,  an increase of 52,800 compared with   24th October;  all the divisions of the country shared in this   increase, the  main variations being in London, South Eastern and   South Western  England  (-j-21,600) ;  in the North Eastern and North   Western Divisions of England (+19.700) and in Scotland (*9,400).   Insured workers in employment at 21st November, numbered 9,373,000,   decreases of 24,000 as compared with a month earlier and of   149,000 as  compared with a year earlier.   The decline in   employment was chiefly due to the continuance of the seasonal   decline in the building industry, public works contracting,  the   distributive trades and the hotel, boarding house,  road transport   and shipping services;  on the other hand slight improvements   were shown  in  the iron and steel, motor vehicle and cotton   industries;  and in textile bleaching and finishing.        Overseas Trade -  The excess of imports over exports of   merchandise in the period January-November 1952 was  263.2   million, or  106.5 million less than in the corresponding period   of 1931.   In  the same periods of 1932 and 1931 imports of   merchandise were valued at  642.6 million and  785.2 million   respectively and exports of goods of United Kingdom produce  or   manufacture at  332.6 million and  357.1 million respectively.        Rail and. Road Traffic - During the 4 weens and the 47 weeks   ended 27th November compared with the corresponding periods  of   last year railway traffic receipts declined by  852,000 (or  7.56   per cent.) and  12,988,000 (or 9.11 per cent.),  respectively.
                                                        I .    I Ifi                                                           &amp; 11-.     The following statement  shows  the percentage declines inthe various classes of traffic  during  the same periods ended27th November,  comparison being made in  each case with thecorresponding period of last  year.---	4 weeks ended 27th November, 1932.	47 weeks ended 27th November, 1932.Passenger train traffic .......	3.59	6.60Coal, coke &amp; patent fuel traffic	1.53	7.03Other freight train traffic ...	14.60	13.42	7.56	9.11		     New registrations of motor cycles in October,  1932,  comparedwith October, 1931, increased by 15 (0.6$) and of other motor vehicles by 2,127 (or 13.6$).     Coal-mining -  During the 13 weeks ended 19th November theaverage weekly output was 3,983,000 tons, a decline of 8.3 percent, compared with the corresponding period of last year  theaverage number of persons employed weekly in the same period tjjas774,500, - 53,400 less than in the corresponding period of 1931.The export trade for the four weeks ending 26th November,  ascompared with the period ending 29th October,  showed appreciableincreases for the Bristol Channel, North East Coast and Humber,and a small decrease for East Scotland.   The Scandinavianmarket was more promising and showed a tendency to buy ahead of immediate requirements;  in South Wales the export position was practically unchanged.   The quantity of anthracite exportedduring January-November, 1932; was greater by 488,-000 tons thanthe quantity shipped during the corresponding period last year.The demand for coal for domestic use and for inland purposesgenerally continued at a lower level than last year.     Iron and Steel -  Fifty-nine blast furnaces were inoperation at the end of November, the same number as in October,but elevec less than a year ago.   Production of pig iron in                            -2-
*     November amounted to  267,700 tons  compared  with 275,600 tons      in October (in which  month there was one  more working day) and      296,400 tons in November,  1931.    Steel output in November      (473,SQO tons)  was the highest  in  any month since February last      but production was still well below 5Gf5 of  capacity.   The      effect  of the dutjos  was  reflected in the large decrease  in      imports;  exports of  iron  and. steel and manufactures thereof      of United Kingdom production amounted in  November to      170,300 tons, the highest  figure registered in any month  since      April.    There was little  change in general market conditions      but the efforts of home producers  of pig  iron to reduce stocks      resulted in a certain amount of domestic  competition.           Shipping and Shipbuilding  -   The freight index figures      advancod from 79.49 in October  to  SI.67 in  November - an  increase      which was attributed  to the higher rates  which were paid  in the      &quot;long&quot;  trades.    Chartering was active for  the shipment of wheat      from Australia - and the Argentine.    Outward rates for coal      continued on an unsatisfactory  level.   Shipbuilding showed a      little  more activity;  a  small  ocean steamer, a passenger      steacier, two 5,-o.00 ton Cargo boats,  one 2,000 ton collier and      one sea-going tug were ordered.    Purchasers have been found      for several modern ships  and a  good number  of old ships were      disposed of to shipbreakers.           Machine Tools -   Whilst the home trade was in a somewhat      depressed condition the value of exports  of machine tools of      United  Kingdom manufacture increased from  1,726,000 in the      eleven  months ended November 1931  to  2,972,000 in the      corresponding period  of this year.           Electrical Industry -  Compared with October a  small      seasonal increase was reported  in  the productive capacity      occupied in November  in the lighter branches of apparatus;  so      far as  heavy plant was concerned there was  a slight decline.      The index of home orders for heavy plant  fell from 58 in  October      to 54 in November; the index for  exports rose, however,                                -3-
2 points to 69, thus continuing the upward  movement which^i.^started in the previous month.   Orders for lighter materialwere well maintained &quot;but prices were regarded asunsatisfactory.     Motor Industry -  The home trade showed a tendency to decline;  the demand for light trucks was fairly satisfactoryhut for the heavier type of commercial vehicles the demand waschecked to some extent by the uncertainty arising from thepossible application of the &quot;fialter&quot; report.   Employment in theMidland area  was better than a year ago.   Exports, owinglargely to the exchange position, continued to expand.   steps were being taKen by the industry to prepare a case for aredtiction of duty for submission to the Australian Tariff Board.     Ootton -  The improvement which was expected to follow thesettlement of the wage dispute in the Weaving Section was not fully realised owing to the stoppage which occurred in the spinning section at the beginning of November.   Deliveries ofraw cotton to mills rose from 73.0 million lbs. in September,to 101*5 million lbs. in October, and to 103.0 million lbs. inNovember;  sales, after a temporary improvement following thesettlement of the dispute,  declined in the latter part of themonth.   Unemployment among spinners at the end of november was slightly higher than a year ago but there was less unemploy-ment among weavers.   The general seasonal improvement in cotton industries abroad which normally takes place at this timeof the year was less than usual,  except in the case of IndiaY/here the activity was at a higher level.   The competition of japanese piece goods continued to be severely felt in our overseas markets.   Exports from Japan of piece goods averagedSCO million square yards per month in July-October or over halfas much again as in the corresponding months of last year.     7ool -  The home trade showed no marked expansion and therewas a certain amount of caution and hesitancy in placing orders.                             -4-
With the exception of wool tops, exports of woollen and worsted yarns and manufactured goods were at a lov/ level;   inthe case of wool tops of United Kingdom manufacture the valueof exports during January-November increased by  971,000compared with the corresponding period of last year.     SilK and Artificial SilK -  In the manufacturing section aslight Improvement was reported traceable to seasonal demands for the Christmas trade;  the Keen competition from japanese and Continental manufacturers was detrimental to &quot;bulic&quot; business.The spun silK section showed little change and employment  waspoor.   The making-up sections worked full time but purchaseswere for immediate requirements only;  the hose Departments ofthe industry were busy and, owing to the import duties, therewas little foreign competition.   The silk sewing thread sectionswere ouiet for the time of the year.     Other Industries -  The conditions in the chemical industry were fairly satisfactory with a moderate volume of business;the glass industry increased in activity;  the home demand fordyestuffs declined as compared with October, when the highestfigure fot the year was reached;  business in pharmaceuticalproducts and coal  tar products was moderate.   The seed-crushing industry showed an advance of Ipjs on the business for october and was slightly better than for November,  1931;  forthe eleven months ended November trade was,  however,  about 9%less than for the corresponding period of last year.    The home market for motor tyres was steady and comparable with thefigures of last year;  in overseas market competition was  severe.     The wheat,Situation -  The produotion of wheat in canadian  1958 was 127 million bushels in excess of that of 1931  but,owing to the heavy shipments which have been taking place  inrecent months from the Dominion the quantity available forexport and &quot;carry over&quot; on 31at October (34-1 million bushels)was only 76 million bushels more than on the same date of  1931.
According to Canadian estimates more than 50$ of the volumeof world movements of wheat during the present crop year(August-November) were from the Dominion.   During January-November when the total imports of wheat into the UnitedKingdom declined by nearly 14 million cwts. compared with thecorresponding period of 1931 the quantity imported from Canadaincreased by over 15 million cwts. and that from the UnitedStates declined by nearly 6 million cwts.     Retail Trade -  The sales of the Co-operative wholesale society Limited during the 4 wee^s ended 5th November showed anincrease of 1.5 per cent, compared with the correspondingperiod of 1931.     Finance -  The new 5% Conversion Loan (which was qu.icKlyoversubscribed) and the Notes to the American Government on thesubject of Debts were the chief topics of interest in financialcircles.   The re-opening of the War Debt problem &quot;broughtfinancial business to a standstill.   The banking situation wasunchanged;  deposits remained at a high level and advances totrade and industry continued to contract;  money rates for shortterm loans and hills showed a tendency to rise;  the average rate at which 3 months&apos; Treasury Bills were allotted was 16s.5dper cent, in November compared with 14s.9d per cent, in october and 11s.Id per cents in September.   The foreign exchangemarket was particularly sensitive.   In Prance the atmospherewas described as one of deepening &quot;gloom and despondency&quot;.A report of the German Institute of Economic Studies for thethird quarter of the year indicated a general improvement inmost of the leading industries in Germany.     Canadian Trade -  Business operations, generally speaieing,were at a slightly lower level in October than in the precedingmonth, the business index figure declining from 77.1 inSeptember to 75.3 in October;  the figure for manufacturing                           -6-
                                                            i-J .:. \Jproduction declined from 74.3 in September to 70.6 in October;on the other hand the index for mineral production increased from 89.5 in September to 99.3 In October.   &quot;\ftiolesale prices in October reached the lowest point since the war when theofficial index was 65.0 compared with 66.9 in September.     Australian Trade - For the period July-October trade (in australian currency) was as follows:-  Imports  25,910,000,Exports  22,916,000, compared with  18,469,000 and  21,459,000respectively for the corresponding period in 1931.   Exports ofwheat for the season ended in November amounted to 122.2 million bushels compared with 133.6 million bushels in 1930-r-l;  flourexports for the same seasons totalled 600,000 tons in 1931-2and 548,000 tons in 1930-1.   The quantities of butter,  cheeseand eggs shipped since 1st July to the last available date were greater than in the corresponding period of last year.     Indian Trade -  The trade figures for the period January-October showed a shrinkage compared with the correspondingperiod of 1931 (which was itself a bad year).   During thisperiod in 1932 imports and exports of private merchandise amountedto 112 crores and 115 crores respectively;  the corresponding figures for 1931 were 118 crores and 140 crores respectively.In spite of the considerable fall in the value of imports thevalue of cotton piece goods imported increased from 1,116 lakhsin January-September 1931 to 1,605 lakhs in the correspondingperiod of 1932.   The wholesale price index number for allcommodities has remained at 91 since August last - a fact thatwas regarded as a hopeful sign of impending improvement.     (A lakh a 100,000 Rupees;  A crore = 10,000,000 Rupees).
