 QUM33JT IS Tm PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY18 (X)VERNMi3?T.      3 J                                                    COPY NO.       ^2 (32).                                QABIH  T.                        Indian  Round Table Conference.                Provision  against Comaercial Discrimination.                      Position  of the Shipping  Industry.             Memorandum &quot;by, the President of -frhe Board of  Trade.            The  Secretary of State for India has circulated a       memorandum  (CP,  484(32)) on the general question of the       provisions  to he  inserted in the Indian  Constitution as a       safeguard against commercial discrimination.    I think it may       &quot;be convenient, in view of the desire  of  the Secretary of State       to he able  to discuss these questions in the Round  Table       Conference, if the Cabinet oould also aome to a decision on       the  question of the  protection against discrimination to be       given to  British  shipping.   This question was discussed       (^although no conclusion  was reached)  at  an early meeting of       the  Cabinet Committee, and I should not have troubled my       colleagues  in the Cabinet were it not for the question of       urgency.            I have received most urgent representations from the       shipping industry to the effect that definite safeguards       should be inserted to prevent discrimination against British       shipping.            My colleagues will be aware that discrimination against     ,  British shipping has  been definitely threatened on more than       one occasion,- and in the faoe of definite threats it is only       reasonable, to provide definite safeguards.   I attach the       greatest possible importance to express provisions in the       constitution against shipping discrimination, and I would ask       that the following&apos; / amendments be made to the draft Const!tutio
(l)   &quot;A specific article should be inserted on the    lines of Article 10 of the Imperial Merchant    Shipping Agreement, to make it absolutely clear    that there shall be no discrimination against    British ships.   The Article should, in my opinion,    be to the following effect: -         British ships shall be granted access to      Indian ports on equal terms with ships      registered in India, and no laws or regulations      relating to sea-going ships in India shall      apply more favourably to ships registered in      India, or to the ships of any foreign country,      than they apply to British ships.(2)    I wish it to be made clear that the Indian    legislature shall not have power to lay down    conditions as to the constitution or directorate of    companies carrying on trade in or with India, so    as to restrict either the shareholding or the    directorate or the principal officers (including    agents) of the Company to an Indian majority.  So    far as I am aware this is possible under the    present draft of Article 170.       I think that this limitation should be of genera!    effect and should not apply to shipping only.         I think Article 170(1) should be amended so as    to make it clear beyond doubt that it extends to    the holding of shares in, and being a director
     of a company carrying-on trade or business,     including shipping,  in or with British India,     I would further propose that subsection (3)  he     amended hy the addition of the following     clause J-             &quot;The enjoyment by a British Company of          the benefits of the preceding paragraph          shall not he dependent on the fulfilment          hy the Company of any condition as to the          reiiBft or domicile of any of its shareholders,          directors, or principal officers,&quot;(3)      The proviso to Section 170, relating to    subsidies, would make it possible for any    legislature to pass a law giving a subsidy to    a particular company carrying on a particular    trade (e.g, engaging in coastwise shipping),    Subsequently to the passing of such a law, the    Government of India would he empowered to    impose conditions as to the directorate etc. of    companies engaging in the subsidised industry,    provided that this power should apply only to    companies formed tafter the date of the law.         My colleagues will be aware that new    companies may he formed after the present crisis,    and that existing companies may be reconstituted    in such a form as legally to be new companies,    I think therefore that the provision as drafted    is most dangerous.   In my view, the provision    as to subsidies ought to he deleted altogether,    or failing that, the Government of India should    be empowered to Impose conditions only with regard    to the individual company actually subsidised.
               I  therefore  recommend  that at the least the               following words of line 4 of the proviso be               deleted.:-  &quot;on companies formed after the date               of the  law&quot;.     There are two further  questions  of a general character and not confined  exclusively to  shipping, in connexion., withthe proposals for the  prevention of comuercial discriminationto which I desire to refer, viz:-          (i)        I am anxious that in any definition of               the companies which are to receive protection,               a  formula should  be adopted which will  clearly               include not  only  commercial companies properly               so-called, but also, e.g. banks and  insurance               companies.   An appropriate wording might be               &quot;limited liability and other companies,               partnerships and  associations formed for the               purpose of commerce, finance, industry,               transport, or any other business&quot;.         ( ii)       There should also in my view be some               specific mention  of taxation.   I fear  that if               any doubt is allowed to remain as to whether               discriminatory forms of taxation are covered,               the other safeguards may be rendered ineffective,     Finally, I should add  that  I strongly support  theproposal to make  use in the Articles  of some such phrase as&quot;disabilitjr or discrimination&quot; instead of referring todiscrimination only.
