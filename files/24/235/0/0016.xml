S S C R E To             REPLY TO  UNITED STATES NOTE. lo      In the Note of  the  10th November, His Majesty&apos;s Government put forward a request to the Government of the United  States of America to enter upon discussions with a view to  the  adjustment of the British War Debt, and at the same time they  suggested a suspension of the payment due on the 15th December,  their purpose being to avoid the financial and political  unsettlement which must follow a resumption of War Debt payments, to avert the intensification of the present world depression by further disturbance of the exchanges, to foster  the revival of  commercial confidence, of which some hesitating signs have recently appeared, and finally to allow of a close examination between the United States and this country of the whole subject in preparation for the International Economic Conference. 2.     His Majesty&apos;s Government warmly welcome that part of the reply of the United States Government in which they express their willingness to facilitate such discussions, and, noting that it does not appear to the United States Government that sufficient reasons have been given for their request for the suspension of the December instalment, they now propose to set out in greater detail the considerations which actuated them in presenting their previous Note.                          I. 3.     The War produced a profound disorder in the course of international trade, and after 14 years this disorder has cul- minated in a crisis of unparalleled severity.  It has resulted in a general collapse of trade throughout the civilised world, with widespread unemployment and a disastrous fall in all national incomes including those both of the United States ofAmerica and of the United Kingdom.                             -1-
       The  causes  of  the  depression may he manifold, hut it                                                 have been ens has  b.en generally-recognised  that &quot;&apos;ar Debts and Reparations/ of the major  causes,  and that  a  settlement of these debts  which will  relieve the world of anxieties under this head, is an  indispensihle condition of a revival cf general prosperity.   As  the Basle Committee declared in December last the &quot;adjustment  of all Reparations and War Debts  to  the  troubled circumstances of the world is the only lasting  step capable  of re-establishing con- fidence, which is the very condition of economic stability and real peace.&quot;  The Committee proceeded &quot;We appeal to the Governments on whom  the responsibility for action rests  to permit of no delay in coming to decisions which will bring an amelioration of  this grave crisis which weighs  so heavily on all  alike.&quot;  While in  so...e respects it may be difficult for  Governments to remedy the troubles of the world, there  are  certain steps which it  is clearly -atthin their- powers  and  their  responsibility tc take. 3.         The system of  war debts was called into beingby the war requirements  cf the belligerent nations.  The resources in  man power and production of the Allied countries had from 1914 been wholly employed in the prosecution of the War;   their normal tracing activities were to a large extent suspended and they had therefore less than their normal resources available for purchasesabroad.  But  the vast requirements for war purposes in any case far exceeded any normal means of payment and couldonly be financed by means of loans from the producing countries.   The loans raised, whether they were marketloans or Government loans, were taken,  not in the form ofmoney, but  in the form of goods and enormously augmentedthe volume  of exports of  the lending countries.   Per example, before 191b the U.S. export surplus normallyvaried from 0200 million  to  600 million.   In 1917  and
1918 it was about $3,000 million and in 1919 itexceeded 84,000 million.   The United States madeloans to the Allies (including the United Kingdom)totalling approximately $1.0,000 millions ( 2055millions at par);  the United Kingdom made loans toits European Allies amounting to  1600 millionsequivalent  (at par) to ^7,800 millions;  the FrenchGovernment had made similar loans equivalent (at par)to ^2,237 millions.   In the aggregate these loansreached the colossal total of approximately $&quot;20,000millions (equivalent at par to over  4000 millions).5.   If the course of commerce were deflected to theextent required to repay these war-time debts, itwould entail a radical alteration in the economy bothof the debtor and of the creditor countries.   Duringthe first few years after the war this -was recognised and no attempt was made to collect them.   But it proved impossible to secure a general agreement fortheir remission and the debtor Powers were calledupon to fund their engagements.    Prom 1923 onwardsa series of agreements v/ere concluded providing fortheir repayment on varying terms and in 1924 a pro-visional settlement was reached of German reparations on the
Q -5O J.basis of the Dav/es Plan.  The annuities providedfor  in most of  these agreements were low during theearlier years and their payment was rendered possibleTY the flow of  investment capital from the UnitedStates of America to Continental Europe, which wasthen taking place.  But the prosperity of theperiod from 1923 to 1929 was to a large extentillusory and the seeds of future trouble hadalready been sown.6.   In the summer of 1929 the storm that wasbrewing v/as not yet visible and it was hopedthat conditions were sufficiently stabilisedfor a final settlement of reparations in theform of the Young plan under which Germanyundertook to pay annuities of about $500million ( 100 millions at par) of which the major part was passed on as War Debt payments.Unhappily almost before the ink had dried on theagreements embodying the Young Flan, the storm hadburst upon the world.  Startled and alarmed, thelenders who had for five years so liberally pouredtheir capital into Continental Europe withdrew suchfunds as were immediately recoverable.  The debtorsmade desperate efforts to meet their liabilitiesbut confidence became more and more shaken and towards the middle of 1931 something like a panic prevail-ed.  Since then the world has been living under the stress
U (4of repeated shocks,  which have completely underminedthe confidence on which the system of private in-vestment depended.  The process of disintegrationhas been pursued to  the point where it has become an attempt to liquidate not only private fortunesand industries but whole countries.  Currencies are threatened with instability, if not with collapse,and the controls and restrictions intended to remedy the trouble have merely aggravated it.  Everywheretaxation has been ruthlessly increased and expendi-ture drasticall3^ curtailed, and yet Budgets are in deficit or are balanced with ever increasingdifficulty.  In all directions there are signs ofthe paralysis of trade, and the threat of bankruptcyand of financial collapse.  The international monetary mechanism without which the modern worldcannot effectively conduct its daily life is beingbroken into pieces with all the manifold forms ofprivation and distress which this involves.   Thecountries of the world cannot even begin to consider how to restore this mechanism until the causes whichundermine confidence have been removed.  One of themost important of these is the system of inter-Governmental debts.7.     These inter-Governmental debts are radically &apos;different from the commercial loans raised by foreign Governments on the markets for productivepurposes.  Such commercial loans are normallyself-liquidating.  The market Loans thus raisedduring the last hundred years have converted whole
                                                      Goterritories from desolate swamps or uninhabited plainsto flourishing provinces teeming with human life and producing- great additions to the real wealth ofthe world.  Such productive Loans directly afford the means whereby the borrower can repay them with interest and at the same time become more prosperous.But Reparations and War Debts represent expenditureon destruction.  Fertile fields were rendered barrenand populous cities a shattered ruin.   such expenditure, instead of producing a slow and steadyaccumulation of wealth, destroys in a few hours thestored up riches of the past.  Like the shells onwhich they were largely spent, these loans wereblown to pieces.  They have produced nothing to repay them and they have left behind nothing butfresh complications and perplexities.8.   The repayment of these war debts necessitatesunnatural transfers which provoke widespreadeconomic evil.   Insofar as they have been paidin the past, their payment was made possible, directly or indirectly, by further foreign lending on the partof the creditor countries, which temporarilyconcealed but eventually aggravated the difficulties.In the long run, inturnational debts can only be paidin the form of goods or services.   But as theBasle Report of August 18th, 1931, truly pointed out&quot;In recent years the world has been endeavouring to pursue two contradictory policies in permitting thedevelopment of an international financial system which involves the annual payment /
of large, sums by debtor to Creditor countries,while at the s erne time putting obstacles inthe way of the free movement of goods.    Solong as these obstacles remain, suchmovements of capital must necessarily throwthe world&apos;s financi al b alone e out ofequilibrium&quot;.9.     The creditors insofar as they have refused to accept payment in goods havecompelled their debtors to pay in gold.This has led to a drain on the Cold reserves of many countries and  this in turn has forcedup the price of gold in terms of cocaxoditiesor, in other words, has forced down  the priceof commodities in terms of gold currencies.This process has brought about the presentcalamitous fall in prices and lias thereforecaused widespread ruin to producers ixi debtorand creditor countries alike and threatens disastroussocial and political repercussions.   It hasseriously increased the burden of commercialdebts5   but it has rendered intolerable the peculiar burden of unproductive war debts.10.     The difficulties in maintaining thepayments fixed under  existing agreements firstbecame acute in the case of Germany and despite the Moratorium adopted as the resultof President Hoover&apos;s  initiative lastyear the apprehensions created by thesituation in that country caused largewithdrawals of credits which, in turn,                   -7-
 involved London as a leading international centre.   The consequent movements of capital forced the United Kingdom to abandon the Gold Standard and, while sterling has remained more stable in terms of goods than the gold currencies, the events of September 1931 gave a profound shock to confidence in the monetary system throughout the world.  Thus the baneful effects of these unnatural transfers in respect of reparations and war debts have gravely accentuated the difficulties of all five Continents including many countrieswhich were neither debtors nor creditors in  the  &quot;tragic book keeping&quot;which resulted from the War.  Confidence and credit cannot reviveuntil an end has been put to these attempts to force the stream ofcapital to flow uphill.11.      In this connexion, it is pertinent to recall the statement made by the Secretary of the United States Treasury in his annual report for 1924-25, that the principle of capacity to pay doesnot require the foreign debtor to pay to the full extent of itspresent or future capacity.  The debtor Government must, he continued &quot;be permitted to preserve and improve its economic position,to bring its budget into balance, and to place its finances andcurrency on a sound basis, and to maintain and, if possible, toimprove the standard of living of its citizens.  No settlement whichis oppressive and retards the recovery and development of theforeign debtor is to the best interests of the United States or ofEurope.&quot;  A resumption of war debt payments in the present circum-stances appears altogether inconsistent with the principles herelaid down.         Experience has, in fact, shown that when dealing with international transfers of the character and of the unprecedentedmagnitude of the post-war inter-Governmental obligations, theprinciple of &quot;the capacity to pay&quot; of the debtor - even if thusapplied - can only be regarded as of secondary importance comparedwith an even wider principle, viz. that of the capacity of theworld to endure the economic and financial consequences which thosetransfers would involve.
 12.    It is  in the  light of these  wider  economic and financial consequences that  successive British Governments  have  framed their  well-known policy on this question which is referred  to in a  later passage of this note.        His Majesty&apos;s Government  are aware that any remission of war  detts may he  criticised as merely transferring the  liability from  the taxpayer in the &quot;borrowing country to the taxpayer in the lending country and  in this  respect the  taxpayers in the United Kingdom and  in the  United States  of America  are in much the  same  position.   Both  are already hearing a  large share of  the burden of War Detts and would continue  to  bear  it,  even  if all the  existing war debt arrangements between the Governments  could be main- tained.   For example,  in  the  case  cf the United Kingdom the  effect of  its  reparation and  v/ar debt arrangements was  to provide  a  sum sufficient  to  cover the current payments  to  the United  States  Government.   But this does not  mean that the  British taxpayer  v/as relieved frem his  burdens  in  respect of the  advances made to the Allies during the War;  on  the  contrary he was left to find over  80 millions  a year  (^39C million at par) for  interest  on the  internal loans  cut of which those advances  had been made.   For  all  xhe  reparation and war debts receipts of the United Kingdom  are required to cover  the  current payments  due on  its  own War Deet to the United States Government, and the UnitedKingdom taxpayer has had e a ash  year  to find from hisown resources the amount required for the interest on the advances made by the United Kingdom to theAllies which, as stated above,  amounted to a total
 of about  1,600 million ($ 7800 million at par-). In the case of the United States of America, the amount due from foreign Governments in respect of war  debts is new $ 27J millions a year, and if this is not received, it would increase by that amount the burden on the American taxpayer.   It will be seen therefore that the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently advocated  is one  which,  if it involves sacrifices  on the part of the American taxpayer,  has involved similar sacrifices on the  part of their own taxpayers.    The interests of the  two countries  looked at from this  standpoint are  the  same.     But  it would he taking altogether  too narrow  a  view to  regard those interests as  being limited  to securing payment  of these  war debts from the borrowing  Governments, 13.     Fayments  across  the  exchange,  restricted as they are by  the effect of  tariffs  and tradeCarriers,  are essentially different from paymentsiaade by the  taxpayer  in his own  currency and  theburden  of these vast  inter-Governmental  debts mustbe judged by  comparison not with  the volume ofinternal  revenue, but with  the balance  of trade.So long as  debtor  nations  are  compelled
by every means to augment their exportsurpluses; in order to meet these inter-Governmental debt burdens, they cannotplay their part in the normal economicoperations of commerce and their diminishedpurchasing power will reflect itself indiminished receipts for the producers inthe creditor country, with consequent fallin prices,depression of industry and unemployment.   Even a partial recovery ofbusiness activity in the creditor countries as a consequence of the removal of theseabnormal conditiDns would result inadditional receipts from taxation sn theexisting scale which would compensate the exchequers of the creditor countries many times ever for the loss of revenue involvedin the revision of the War Debt Settlements.14.  The immediate loss which both theUnited Kingdom and the United States ofAmerica taxpayers would suffer from areconsideration of war debts cannot be measured  in  the same scales as the untoldloss of wealth and the human misery causedby the present economic crisis.   Thevalue of  international trade had alreadysix months ago decreased  in three yearsby 50%, or by the equivalent of  5 millions
s for every hour, night and day, that passes, ana the situation has since deteriorated even further.   It will not profit a creditor country to collect a few million pounds or dollars if it thereby perpetuates a world disorder which, reacting on itself, involves losses of revenue many times greater;  and a settlement, however generous it may seem, v/hich relieves the economic machinery of the world by qlearing up these inter-governmental payments, would be repaid again and againby the contribution which it would make to world revival. 15.    For this loss and suffering isnot due to the niggardliness of nature.The triumplis of physical science areever growing and the vast potentialities of the production of real wealth remainunimpaired.    It is in the power of theGovernments of the world, and particularly of the United States  of America and of theUnited Kingdom as the two greatest creditornations, if they unite in co-operation, tomake the first and essential step towardsaverting disaster, financial,  economic andpoli tical.
     16.  For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs H.M. Government &quot;base their request fora re-examination of the whole situation on the fact                               in their viewthat the payment of War Debts has/been proved tobe inconsistent with the present economic organisation of the world, and. that any resumptionof these payments is bound to accentuate gravelythe present crisis and to compromise fatally allefforts to counteract it.    But apart fromthese general considerations H.M. Governmenthold che sincere conviction that this requestis fully justified on the grounds of the pastrecord of the United Kingdom in the matter of inter-Governmental debts, and of their presentposition.     17.  In the first place they would draw attention to the unprecedented efforts whichhave been made by the United Kingdom.   The total british War expenditure in the U.S.A. amountedto approximately $18,000 million ( 2,400 million at par).Of this total, only about one-third was financed by borrowing from the U.S. Government. Approximately$3,000 million ( 600 million) was obtained bythe sale of gold and of securities representingthe available capital assets which K.M.Governmenthad. at its disposal, the transfer of which hasof course reduced -permanently the wealthof this coiintry.   In addition H.M. Governmentraised commercial loans on the U.S. market before
 the entry of the United States into the War,  to the amount of about $1,480 millions ( 304 millions at par).   The balance of British War Expenditure in the United States of America was financed by the export of British goods,  and by the re-imtursement on the part of the United States Government of expenditure incurred by his Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of the Allies and of sterling supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government tc the United States troops0           Of these market borrowings $1,340 millions ( 275 millions)  have been repaid,,   In respect  of the debt  to the United States Government  payments have been made amounting to $1P352  million ( 278  million  at par)  of which $202 millions (cS42 million at  par)  were in  respect of the principal of the debt as  funded.   Furthermore,  in addition to the payments under  the  Funding Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government have paid $253  million ( 48 million)  in respect of  the War Debt before funding,  and  they  have  repaid in full both the Loan for  the purchase  of  silver  amounting to  $122 million and the debt of  $16 million  for  relief  supplies  tc Austria,  The total cf these debt payments which His Majesty&apos;s  Government have made to the United States since  the War  amount  to the sum of $3,063 million ( 629 million), 18.        Meanwhile  the  United  Kingdom had claims on its Allies in  respect of  the War Loans  it had  made.  The  advances made by this country  anmumted, as  stated above,  to  1,600millions ($7,800 millions)  and had increased subsequently by the  addition of unpaid Interest  to  capital,  Shortly after theWar His Majesty&apos;s Government offered to  join in any equitable arrangement for the reduction or/
0 9cancellation of inter-allied debts provided it was  of  anall-round character.  That proposal was  not accepted andHis Majesty&apos;s Government were called upon to fund  theirdebt to the United States of America. They then announcedthat they would limit their demands on their own debtorsto the amount that they were themselves  required to pay totheir creditor.  The fact that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere the first to fund their debt to the United  States ofAmerica, and that some time elapsed before their debtorscompleted funding agreements with them has resulted intheir receipts from their debtors being  less than  halftheir payments to their creditor.  The relative  positionis that the United States of America made loans  amountingto $10,000 millions ( 2,055 millions) and the UnitedKingdom made similar loans amounting to  $7800 millions( 1,600 millions);  the United States of America havereceived for the benefit of their taxpayers $2112  millions( 434 millions) and the United Kingdom have received forthe benefit of their taxpayers nothing,  have passed on all their receipts to the United States of America,  and have paid out of the pockets of their taxpayers to the  UnitedStates of America $651 millions ( 134 millions).  In factwhen interest has been taken into account some   200 millions($973 millions at par) has been found by the British tax payer.  It may be observed that, while the British  shareof the total indebtedness to the United  States  of  america is only 40$, of the total debt payments  made to the UnitedStates of America 80% has come from Great Britain.  The  efforts which this has involved to the British nation,  coming  as  theydid after the losses resulting from the  war, constitute,  inthe view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, a  strong claim  to consideration on the part of the United  States Government.
 19.   Moreover,  His Majesty&apos;s Government feel justified  in  calling  attention  to the changes of circumstances which have  increased the burden of their obligations.      In the first place the British debt is expressed  in terms of gold, but the burden on the British people  is measured in terms of sterling. The payment due on December 15th is owing to this circumstance increased from  19f million to approximately  30 million.   The importance of this from the national standpoint needs no emphasis.     In fact, however, as already stated,  the discharge  of all international debts must in the long run take the form of a transfer of goods or services.   The average wholesale price index in the United states of America during the period when the debt was incurred was 189 and is now under 94 (taking 1913 as a basis in each case).The debt therefore represents today in terms of goods not less than twice the amount which wasborrowed.     In this connection HoM.  Government would point out that the effect of the American Tariff has beenrestrict rather than to facilitate the import of the manufactured goods which the United Kingdomproduces and the difficulties in this respect havenot decreased in recent years.    In 1923 when theBritish War Debt was funded,  the War Debt annuity amounted to  35 million or approximately half thevalue of the British domestic exports to the United States ( 60 million).----
                                                      OAFrom 1933 onwards the annuity which we should haveto pay  in respect of the War Debt would amount atpresent rates of exchange to approximately  60million, whereas the British domestic exports to theUnited States of America amounted to only  18 million in 1931 and are not likely to exceed  16 million for1932.     The imports into the United Kingdom fromthe United States show an equally remarkable fallfrom  211 millions in 1923 to  104 millions in 1931and  59 millions in the first nir.e months of 1932.The total trade between the two countries from thetime of the Funding Agreement has fallen from about  300 millions a year to  100 millions.20.  If, therefore, War Debt payments had to be resumed, it is apparent that the exchange positionof this country would need to be strengthened by areduction of the very heavy adverse balance ofvisible trade between the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America, which amounted to 78 millions in 1931.    In present circumstances,this could only be done by adopting measures v/hichwould further restrict British purchases of Americangoods.    The United Kingdom has up to the presentgenerally been the best customer of the UnitedStates  and the result of such restrictions would inevitably be to reduce specially the market inthe United Kingdom for American farm products.To the  extent therefore that payments were resumed
to the United States Treasury a definite and unfavourablereaction must follow to the United States producer.      Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government would also haveto guard against the effects which would follow if thefacilities offered by the British market were used by theether debtors of America to obtain sterling which theywould then sell across the Exchange in order to meet their obligations to the United States Government.  After thewar, the United Kingdom attempted to maintain its traditionalsystem of free imports with the result that debtor countriesthroughout the world sold their goods on the British market and took the proceeds away over the exchange or in gold tomeet their obligations elsewhere.  Under the stress of thepresent crisis His Majesty&apos;s Government have had to modify their system and to adept tariffs;  but the UnitedKingdom still imports from abroad goods to the valueof several hundreds of million pounds in excess ofwhat it exports and it would be necessary to consider what action could be taken to secure that the sterlingproceeds of these imports were used more largely forthe benefit of the British market.I
21*   President Hoover, in explaining his proposal fora suspension of inter-Governmental payments for theyear beginning 1st July, 1931, stated that its object was &quot;to relieve the pressure of the difficultiesresulting from the fall in prices and lack ofconfidence in economic and political stability, andto assist in the re-establishment of confidence,thus forwarding political peace and economic stability in the world.&quot;     The action then taken gave a much needed respitebut it was not sufficient to r estore confidence.   Thedepression still continues and a resumption of war debtpayments today would, for the reasons outlined above,involve economic reactions which must intensify theinstability of the world.   If President Hoover&apos;s hopesare to be realised, definite remedial action requires to be taken to deal not merely with the British war debt to America but with the whole system of inter-Governmen-tal obligations with which it is related.22.  The initiative in devising a settlement of reparations was taken by the Creditor Governments ofGermany at Lausanne with the cognizance and approvalof the United States Government.  An arrangement was there signed, under which Germany would be substantiallyrelieved of a burden which had become intolerable andthe participating creditors agreed provisionally among themselves to a waiver of their inter-Governmentaldebts.  It was in the nature of things inevitable thatthe settlement was provisional and that its completionwas dependent upon a satisfactory settlement in respectof the debts for which the creditor Powers themselveswere liable to the United States Government.                         -19-
23.     The United States Government have frequently reiteratedthat they do not admit any connection &quot;between reparations and war Debts;  but this differentiation in the matter of inter-Governmental obligations arising out of the War is not acceptedby other countries which have creditor claims on the GermanGovernment and whose ability to meet their own debt payments to the United States of America and to the United Kingdom is undoubtedly affected by the extent to which they are themselvespaid by Germany.  Whichever view is academically correct, thereis a de facto connection between these two sets of inter-Governmental obligations and this was by implication admitted bythe Unixed States Government when they proposed a Moratoriumon all inter-Governmental obligations last year.  Moreover HisMajesty&apos;s Government take it for granted that preferential treatment would never be claimed for the War Debts due to theUnited States of America as compared with those due to thiscountry; and a situation in which this country was required tocontinue war debt payments while foregoing the war debt payments due to it would be admitted at once to be unthinkable.  Thus, ifthe payment of the sums due in respect of the British War Debt tothe United States Government were to be resumed His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be obliged to reopen the question  of payments from their own debtors - Prance, Italy, Portugal, Jugoslavia,Roumania and Greece, and also the British Dominions.  The debtorcountries would, in turn, have to demand the payment byGermany of her obligations under the Young Plan, and theUnited Kingdom would have to do likewise.  Without a readjustmentof war debt obligations the Lausanne Agreement could not be ratified;  the question of reparations would remain unsettled?
the improvement in confidence which followed the lausanne Agreements would he undone, and fatalresults might well he found to have accrued tothe solution of many grave political, LS well as financial, problems now under discussion.24.     His 1,&apos;lajesty&apos;s Government understandthat the Government of the United States ofAmerica have already appreciated the force ofthese considerations in the light of which theyhave recognised the desirability of a discussionof the major point stressed in a previouscommunication, namely the revision cf the existingdebt obligations.    But His Majesty&apos;s government wish to emphasise their conviction that their proposal for a suspension of the Decemberpayment, a proposal which would in no way affectany ultimate settlement, is necessary in orderto create the conditions favourable to a successful issue of the subsequent c onversations0The difficulties of making the transfer inpresent circumstances are so great and wouldinvolve such far-reaching reactions, both financialand political, that the resulting doubts andanxieties in regard to the immediate situationv/ould distract the attention of the Governments and peoples when the chief need v/as an objective andsystematic approach to the problem to be solved.
25.     Allusion has been made in the last paragraph to the  difficulty of any attempt to meet the payment on the  15th December by transfer across the exchange.It lias  been the object of His Majesty&apos;s Government totake  all possible steps to mitigate the fluctuations in the  relative value of sterling and gold currencies.To this end having  in the first place repaid in fulllarge temporary credits borrowed in connection v/lth thefinancial crisis of the preceding year they have acquired certain reserves in gold and in foreign exchange, but though these reserves are adequate forthe purpose for which they v/ere designed they were not intended and would not suffice to cover, as well, thepayment of $9 5-g- millions due on 15th December.
