    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1932.SECRET.                                                Copy No.    war . 402 (32).                                  CABINET.The Unity Conference at Allahabad and Mr.  Gandhi.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   I circulate,  for  the information of  my colleagues, copy of a telegram from theGovernment of India, dated the 17th November.   The &quot; Unity &quot;  Conference between Hindu and  Sikh representatives and theCommittee appointed by the Muslim Conference met towards the end of October, its object being to  try to reach agreement on the communal problem, following which anAll Parties Conference was to be convened  in  order  to arrive at a final settlement.On the 28th October Shaukat  Ali  asked the Viceroy to release Mr. Gandhi to enable him  to take part  in  the  &quot; Unity&quot;  Conference,  and Nationalist  newspapers havesuggested that the refusal to release him in response to this appeal has impaired theprospects of success of  the  &quot;unity&quot;  conversations.   The present telegram forms acommentary on  this allegation and gives a general appreciation of the negotiations.   From Press  telegrams dated the 20th November it appears that such  degree  ofagreement as was reached  at Allahabad has now been decisively repudiated by theMuslims.       India Office,                                   &apos;                 S. H.  21st November 1932.         Telegram from  Government of India, dated  17th November 1932.   As indicated  in  our telegram of the 12th instant, 2531, the proceedings  of the unity Conference at Allahabad must be viewed in close connection with the Gandhisituation and what appears to be a phase of intense Hindu activity in order to recovertheir position.  Until recently it appeared that, with the departure of Shaukat Aliand some of the Punjab delegates and with the unyielding attitude of the Hindus  inregard to Sind, the Conference could end in nothing but failure.  Within the last fewdays, however, great efforts have been made to revive it.  They have resulted in anagreement about Sind, and, according to to-day&apos;s Press reports, some compromise withthe proposals about joint electorates which are not likely to be well received by thoseMuslims who favour separate electorates.  But  apart from  these formal results  itappears that the Hindus have been making the most lavish promises, which, temporarilyat any rate, have had some effect on Muslim opinion.   The  effect is likely to be only temporary, for, as far as we can judge, there is no intention of really making substantial concessions and indeed  my attempt to  do  so would arouse strong hostility of Mahasabha.   But Birla and Malaviya are very busytrying to persuade Muslims that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  will come to  terms withHindus, to which they  will be  compelled  by pressure of  commercial considerations,and that unless Muslims come to an agreement with Hindus they may find themselves,in the  end, left out.   Use is being  made of  argument  that power under  the newconstitution must pass  to the Hindus  and it is wise,  therefore, for Muslims  to makefriends with them.   2. Actually  the  Muslims  still  remaining  at Unity  Conference are  practicallyconfined to those with Congress sympathies, and proceedings of Conference are  looked.upon with  considerable suspicion  by Punjab Muslims and  probably also by BengalMuslims.  Nevertheless,  Hindus are likely to try and maintain among Muslims an attitude of expectancy  by endeavouring  to arrange  for a further and more  rep re-sentative conference to be held later.  In this connection Shaukat Ali  may have his part to play in London.   We  (sis, he)  will probably represent that the Hindus and Muslims have made-remarkable  progress towards an agreement,  and  that  with a little more effort  asatisfactory agreement could be reached, but that what is now required to clinch the     1453    60  11.32
matter is the release  of Gandhi.   The  Hindus have succeeded  in  making someimpression on  the Muslims  by  agreement about  Siud, persuading  them  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will  not agree to tbe separation of Sind, and  consequentlyMuslims  will get on this point, from  the  Hindus, what they cannot  expect  to get from  the British.  It  is doubtful  whether there is  any  other  substantial  point onwhich the Hindus  can  really commit themselves to anything that the Muslims arelikely to  find acceptable.   3. It  appears that the Birla school are hoping to make a considerable impression on British opinion by using commercial arguments.   Their line  will  he  that theBritish cannot  expect  to secure trade with  a  discontented India.   If only their demands  for a new constitution are accepted, then there are  unlimited  opportunities for British trade.   They also  appear  to  think  that,  by  throwing out  the ottawa agreement,  they can bring  home, in a striking way, to the British people the injurythat  can  he clone to them by a discontented India.
