 noCUMEHT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTlfj3 GOVERNMENT. &apos;K &apos;J J                                                  COPY No.    Si42(32) .                               CABINET.                          TRADE WITH RUSSIA.                           EXPORT CREDITS.          MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE.        1.  On  the  4th August the Cabinet authorised the Export    Credits Guarantee Department to guarantee  1,450,000 of    additional credits for trade vath Russia by the end of December,    provided that:-               (a) No credit should exceed  18 months, and               (b) A substantial proportion should be at                     12 months.    The figure has since been  rounded up to  1,500,000 with the    authority  of the Treasury, and in view  of the difficulties to    which condition (b) give rise, the Export Credits Advisory    Committee  were given discretion to obtain the best terms possible    provided alwayB that the length of credit covered by the    guarantees should not in any case exceed 18 months.        2.  The Advisory Committee have been considering what    recommendation they should make as regards the guaranteeing of    credits during the early part of 1933,  pending the issue of the    negotiations for a new Commercial Agreement which we are    about to undertake with the Soviet Representatives.   They hold    the view that  Russia cannot for the present place any    considerable orders on a cash basis and that if exports are    to  be maintained, further  guarantees will be necessary.   The    financial  psosition of the Soviet Government seems to them to    be  bja no means free from anxiety, but after considering their    experience over the past three years, the continued refusal of    the Soviet Government, even under great pressure, to accept    shorter  credits than they  feel able to  repay, and other factors,    such  as  the  great  interest of Germany in keeping the structure    of  credits to  Russia from  breaking down, they do not feel  that
                                                           9 ft A                                                           fV V &apos;yjit would be possible on financial grounds for them to justifythe serious step of refusing all further credits at thepresent time.   The risk involved in giving further guaranteeswould probably, in their view, be increased by any importantrestriction  of the market which this country provides for russian products but until some decision has been taken in thismatter and the effects of that decision can be appreciated theythink that a moderate amount of credit can justifiably beprovided.   5. In these circumstances they would be prepared if theBoard of Trade see no objection to recommend further credits,and in order that British exporters may be placed in no avoidable uncertainty as to what credit facilities will beavailable in the near future, they think that an early decision should be taken.   Unless and until circumstances arising outof the negotiations for a new Commercial Agreement or otherwiseshould necessitate a further review of policy in connectionwith the guaranteeing of credits, they would propose to continuesubstantially at the present rate and on the present terms.That is to say, they would continue for the present torecommend guarantees covering exports at the rate of some 5,000,000 a year on a maximum of 18 months credit.   allowing for the Russian credits which are due to be paid off during1933 this would not involve any considerable addition to theDepartments existing liability.   They recommend that, as before,  no announcement should be made as to the amount ofcredits available and they would endeavour to maintain astrict control of the rate at which these facilities are madeavailable to British exporters, taking account *f all the relevant factors.   4. I am impressed by the Committee&apos;s desire to maintaincontinuity as far as possible in the provision of                               -2-
credit facilities and that- exporters  should he left in no avoidable uncertainty,  In view of the additional employment which  would he provided by the credits recommended by theCommittee and of the negotiating advantage  which we should,in my opinion, derivo from maintaining an uninterruptedflow of guarantees on a moderate level throughout the currency of the expiring Commercial Agreement, I came to  che conclusion-chat the Committee&apos;s recommendations  should be accented.With the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer whohas agreed to these proposals on  &amp;he  understanding that weare not committed to guarantees amounting to more than.Z4.6 millions In xhe year, (ohia being the amount of billsrnati;-&apos;&apos; r.p during the year), I have requested  che AdvisoryCommittee to proceed in accordance with the proposals set out\n paragraph o aDove.W.R0ard of Trade, 19th December,  1932.
