THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1932.                                                                    4&apos;SECRET.                                                Copy No.CP.  415  (32).CABINET.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on Persia written by thePermanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.                                                                    J. S.    Foreign Office, December 2, 1932.                                 PERSIA.    1.  I HAVE read with great interest the memorandum circulated by theSecretary of State for India on the 31st October (CP. 371/32), which reflects,with well-adduced grounds, on the policy of late pursued in the Middle East.This  policy  has habitually  been  hammered  out  by  the  five  interested departments,  including  the India  Office.  It is  a cumbrous,  but no  doubtnecessary, process; and I should have felt that it was hardly my place to offercomment, were it not that I have found a general tendency to interpret thememorandum  as particularly directed  to the Foreign Office.  I trust, therefore,that I may be permitted to put  forward some of the considerations that haveweighed with us;  and, in doing so, I also trust that reply may be distinguished from controversy, which I would emphatically and respectfully disclaim.                               (A) Bahrein.    2.  In dealing with this subject I am not, of course, attempting to challengethe conclusion already reached by  the Cabinet;  but I should, in justice, explain the motives underlying the  Foreign  Office attitude.  Sir Samuel  Hoare and theGovernment of India urge that His Majesty&apos;s Government should resist, so longas is reasonably possible, by every  means in their power, any attempt to secure a reference of the Persian claim to Bahrein to arbitration, or, as the Foreign Officeprefer to put it, to a judicial settlement.  This recommendation is based on theassumption that it is most improbable that the  Persians will be able to oblige usto accept a judicial  settlement of  the Bahrein  question against our will.   now have an uneasy  feeling  that this is skating on rather thin ice.    It is true, as stated in paragraph 7 of  the India Office memorandum, that  Persia cannot takeus to arbitration on  this issue under the Optional Clause.  In the opinion of theForeign Office Legal  Advisers, however, it would be easy for Persia to find a meansof raising the question before the League Council.   The  Persians could, forexample, inform the  Council that in their view Bahrein is territory under Persiansovereignty; that  they wish to establish their  authority over this part of  their territory; that His Majesty&apos;s Government contest their claim, maintaining thatthe sovereignty of the islands is vested in an independent Arab ruler under Britishprotection; that His Majesty&apos;s Government, professing to  be under an obligationto this  ruler to defend his&apos; independence and  to resist any effort by any other government to establish their authority over Bahrein, have made it clear that ifPersia attempts to use force against the Sheikh of Bahrein,  they will help himto offer  resistance;  and  that this is therefore a case to be  dealt with  under      6614  T7885]                           .                      *
                                      2article 11, and possibly under article 15, of the Covenant.  Were the Persians totake this line it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent the issues involved from being examined by the Council, or, in practice, to preventthe Council  from  referring the  matter to a  Legal Committee or seeking an advisory  opinion from the Permanent Court of International Justice.   It seven  possible that  the Council might seek to set up some kind of arbitral corn-mission to deal with the matter, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government might  put themselves in an invidious position by resisting such  a proposal. It is necessary,therefore, frankly to face the situation; since the fact that Persia  could without serious difficulty secure the reference of the matter to arbitration, is a considera-tion which must not be lost sight of, fundamentally affecting as it may the wholeissue     3.  The Secretary of  State  for India  then gives,  in  paragraph  6 of his memorandum, three main reasons why he considers that a reference  of the Persianclaim to Bahrein to  arbitration should be  resisted.    4.  The first  of these is  the &quot; undesirability  of arousing internationalinterest in the Gulf, or of bringing foreign Powers  into closer contact with itthan  can  be  avoided.&quot;  This necessitates a glance both at the existing  situationand the present trend of events.   Internationa] interest has indeed already been thoroughly aroused in the Persian Gulf, and must  inevitably become  greater.In the first place the Gulf is now an international air route of the first importance.French and  Dutch lines already operate this  air route along the  Persian coast of the Gulf; and both the French and the Dutch Governments have  formallyapplied for  permission, should  they so desire, to use  the Arabian route  fortheir air  services.   It has been agreed that it will be impossible for long torefuse to  grant this  permission.  The French and Dutch have indeed alreadybeen  informed  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government have no objection  to theirarranging to use Bahrein and  Gwadar.   Secondly,  the United States Govern-ment have  now  actively,  and  rather  acidly,  intervened  with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  on behalf of  American oil  groups  interested in oil  concessions in the  Gulf.  American  interests have  already secured  the exploitation  ofan  oil concession  in  Bahrein and have  applied for  a  similar  concession  inKoweit.   (In the  latter Mr.  Mellon is personalty interested.)  They  are  alsointerested  in other  areas.  This interest  is  unlikely to decrease.   In  anycase  there  is  a  23-75   United  States   interest   in  the   Iraq  petroleum company, which, even when the pipe-line to the Mediterranean is constructed,will cause the  United States  to take an active interest in the Persian Gulf asbeing the only maritime approach to  Iraq.   Thirdly, a small Persian  flotillain charge of  Italian naval officers has now arrived in the Persian  Gulf.  It  hasalready been necessary, in view  of  this development, to  discuss the  politicalsituation  in the  Gulf  with the  Italian  Government, who  are showing an increasing interest  in the Middle East.  Lastly, with the admission of Iraq tothe League, it will become even more difficult than it has been hitherto to treat the Gulf,  as  was done in the 19th century, as a kind of purely British  preserve.In view of the above considerations, the  argument,  that  to refer the Persianclaim to Bahrein to a judicial  decision by an international court will &quot;arouseinternational interest in the Gulf,&quot;&apos; would not be a commanding one if it stoodalone. On the contrary, it would have seemed to me that  the existing and inevitably increasing international interest in the Gulf appears  to afford a strong arguement for regularising our position, and for disposing finally of such vexatiouscomplications as the  Persian  claim to  what Sir S. Hoare rightly calls our  keyposition there.  It was our disinclination  in the past to face the necessity of doing everything possible  to regularise our position,  which has brought aboutthe present unsatisfactory  state of affairs and our inability to point to anythingbut long usage in justification of that  position.  Would it not be wiser now totake a leaf out of history and avoid any risk in future ?    5.  The second  and third arguments,  adduced  by Sir S. Hoare  againstaccepting a reference of the Bahrein issue to a judicial settlement, are respectivelythat the risk is too great and that the Persian claim has no substance.  these arguments would appear to contain an internecine element.  I  have always held the second view,  and see some  difficulty in  holding  both, though, being  provedwrong, I would willingly accept the first.
    6.  As  regards the question  of risk,  we have  by  now tied  ourselves uppretty tightly in these methods of settlement.  I daresay that the abortive Austro-German  Customs Union may be in the mind of Sir Samuel  Hoare, and  thatdecision, though on  the whole fortunate, shook many confidences  in the PermanentCourt of International Justice.  That case, however, was a highly debatable  one;and in this  case the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office have considered  thatthere is  no  need to fear an unjust judgment, if our claim is as strong as ithas been represented.  The Foreign Office have hitherto  shared the India Officeview that the Persian claim is wholly  unsubstantial.  But it is obvious that thereal strength or weakness of the claim is  an  essential factor  in the method of handling  it.  For this reason I had held  that it was important  to obtain an authoritative legal opinion on the strength  of the British case.  And,  since there seems no doubt that the Persians could eventually oblige us to accept arbitration.I would still deem it valuable that we should know without delay, if only for ourown information,  what  precise value our case possesses.  If  the  Law  Officersconfirm the view, hitherto so confidently held,  that our case  is overwhelming andthat the Persian case is frivolous, a reference of the  matter to judicial decisions would only be dangerous if it were disturbingly maintained that no  arbitrationcan he trusted.  This may furnish an argument  against the whole principle ofinternational arbitration, but once that  principle has been fully accepted  (andit has, in fact,  been accepted by successive Governments of His Majesty  as acardinal principle of their policy), no  valid ground would have seemed to me toremain for refusing arbitration in so good-looking a case.  All things  considered,including human nature, on  which Sir Samuel Hoare so rightly has his eye, Iwould sooner go freely to The Hague  than be  taken to Geneva, with the consequent risk that the matter might be dealt with by some  other body under conditions more favourable to Persia.                         (B) General Negotiations.    7.  The difference of opinion between the Foreign Office and the India office would appear to turn on the conflicting views held by the two Departments (a) asto the value of our &quot; assets,&quot; or of the concessions which we have hitherto beenprepared to offer to Persia in return for our desiderata, and  (b) as to the degreein which the concessions, described in paragraph 13 of Sir S.Hoare&apos;s memorandum as having been wrung  from us by Persia in the course of the negotiations, werein fact  so  obtained, and whether  we could have avoided  making them in any circumstances.    I would here also interject a slight difference of opinion as to the diplomaticskill of Teyniourtache.   From my short personal acquaintance I should judge himto be epicene, or at least similar to Benjamin Constant, who observed how cleverhe would be if he only  knew what he wanted.  He is an intelligent oriental witha touch of the rastaquouere. concerned for his own physical  and political welfare;ghosted, besides, and even more legitimately than the Ghazi, by Soviet Russia,which is within 200 miles of his  capital a fact of which  we must in justicenot lose sight in accounting for his  moods and attitudes.  He  is never likelyto throw himself into  our arms;  indeed, we should  find him an  embarrassmentif he did so and then looked to us for relief from inevitable Russian &quot; sanctions.&quot;One Afghanistan is enough.  Voltaire once observed that  fate is temperament;had he been talking of individuals in the mass he would have said  that fate isgeography.    8.  As regards the relative value of  what we have been prepared to offer to persia, and what we are seeking from Persia in return, our  &quot; assets &quot; and theirtrue value in each case are the following :     (1)  The remission  of the ivar and post-war debt, i.e.,  about   1^ million  ofthe so-called &quot; agreed  debt &quot; of   2 million.  (The half-million of pre-war debtis acknowledged by Persia, and 7 per cent, interest is regularly paid thereon.)  the persians have  already repudiated this  debt,  Avhich they assert not  withoutjustice was spent chiefly  on maintaining British forces in Persia during thewar, and  in prosecuting British Imperial rather than  Persian  national aims.There are no means of  obtaining its repayment, and the Persians  are well aware      [7885]                                                      B  2
                                     4of this. The Treasury have long abandoned hope of its recovery. No international tribunal could extract it from Persia;  and if the matter were referred to such a tribunal, the whole question of the violation of Persian neutrality by the allied armies during and after the war might be brought into question which for various reasons is undesirable.  The remission of the debt can thus scarcely berepresented as a concession, while  insistence on its repayment could certainly notbe  utilised as a  lever,  though, from Mr. Hoare&apos;s telegram  No. 181  of the11th November, it might at most be a small trump in the game.  And here I should say that the decision taken by the Cabinet, to utilise  this debt as a means ofremaining in Hen jam,  causes me  great uneasiness.  I will later  develop  more fully the  reasons  why I consider this line would prove  untenable.  It may besufficient here to note that many other countries have recently defaulted on  theirrecognised debts;  but in no  other case has there been any  idea  of a  forcibleoccupation of territory for their recovery.  It would need no more than the skillof the Chinese representative at Geneva to produce a  Persian portrait of Englandwith a cross-bred Japanese look about it in the eyes of the little Powers of whomalso more anon.     (2) The rendition to Persia of the British concession at Basidu. Our claimto this small concession is, however, extremely doubtful, being based on an obscuregrant by the Sultan of Muscat in 1820, while he was  in occupation  of the island of Kishm, on which Basidu is situated. The concession  has long been practicallyabandoned.    (3) Recognition of Persian sovereignty over the Island of Sirri. This island was occupied by Persia in 1887 and has since remained in her effective possession;but, if we had to arbitrate about Bahrein, we should, of  course, also challenge thePersian position in Sirri.     (4) Transfer  to Persia of the Persian section of the Duzda-p railway, andreopening and continued working  of the railway by  the Government of India. We cannot prevent  the  Persians  from taking  over  the Persian section of therailway track, which  was built by  us as a war necessity; while the real reason forwhich we are prepared to agree, on conditions, to the  reopening and continuedoperation of the Indian section at a financial loss to  the Government of India isthat we think this would be  to the ultimate advantage of Indian trade.   the persians are well aware of this, and there is good  reason to believe that they, fortheir part, attach comparatively little value to the re-opening of the railway.    (5) Abrogation   of  the  Slavery  Convention of 1882. This  Convention,intended to deal with  the extinct negro slave trade from Africa, is out of date, andof little value.  The  new Persian  legislation  against slavery  appears effectively to have replaced it, and the  question  is now far more one of sentiment than of practical importance  to either party.  British war ships would in  any case stillbe able to carry on effective anti-slavery work on  the Arab coast, the main danger-point in connexion with any possible recrudescence of the traffic.     (6) Removal of the  British Residency from Bttshire. The Political Residentis already regarded only as a Consul-General in Persia.   It is entirely anomalousin any case that,  under modern conditions, his headquarters should remain inPersian territory; while, if there is a breach with  Persia, we shall have no choicebut to remove him.   The transfer could therefore hardly be described as a con-cession of real value.   Indeed, we should,  if anything,  gain by  voluntarilyremoving the Residency from Persian soil, thus making ourselves less visiblydependent on Persian goodwill.   It is, in my view, nothing but a disadvantageto His Majesty&apos;s  Government that the Political  Resident,  who is an official ofgreat  importance  and influence to the Arab States  of the Persian Gulf, shouldreside as  a mere consular officer in Persia, where he can be treated accordinghrand worse.     This hand has not much trick-taking power.     9.  In the other  hand are the tricks to be taken, i.e., (a) a lease of the  navalstation at Henjam; (6)  the abandonment of the long-standing Persian claims toBahrein and  to various other  islands;  (c) a  settlement of outstanding  Britishclaims against the  Persian  Government; (d)  a guarantee  of non-aggression against the Arab  Sheikhdoms under  British  protection on the Arabian side ofthe Persian Gulf.  The Persian hand is not easily forced in view of the present.ultra-nationalist spirit,  which has affected Persia in common with other minorlowers since the war.
    10.  As regards, the points of which, according to paragraph 13 of the IndiaOffice-memorandum, we have  gradually  been  &quot;stripped,&quot; a brief  examinationwill  show  that  they were not  peculiar to the Persian  situation, -but..ratherinevitable developments in view of the general world situation.  They are no morethan the changes which had to be accepted in the case of the majority of other powers where a  similar pre-war situation existed.   The Capitulations have, forexample, been abolished  in Turkey, and  in  other  Middle  Eastern countries.Their termination has been acknowledged even in the Hejaz.   We enjoyed themin Persia,  not in virtue of any specific  instrument, but in virtue of our most-favoured-nation  rights only.   They therefore depended on the rights enjoyed byother  countries  in  virtue of  treaties which Persia was  entitled to terminateunilaterally.   Persia  having terminated these treaties,  our own  capitulatoryprivileges  automatically  lapsed, and there was  no question of a gratuitousconcession to Persia on our part.  Tariff  autonomy would have had to be grantedto Persia in any case.   It had long been advocated by the American advisers tothe Persian Government, and the  principle was  recommended by the LeagueOpium Commission which visited Persia  in May 1927.   It has, moreover, proved impossible  to refuse the grant  of tariff autonomy in other cases, e.g., China.   Inregard to the control of quarantine, His Majesty&apos;s Government were faced beforethe present negotiations began with a fait accompli, which could not have been prevented.   The withdrawal of the Indo-European  Telegraph Department  wascarried out in order to serve our own convenience.  It is true that we endeavoured.with some apparent success, to represent it as a concession to Persia,  but it cannotjustly be regarded as a sacrifice wrung from us against our will.  As for the air route, the transfer to the  Arab coast was decided, mainly at the instance of theForeign  Office in view of the  political and  technical advantages which  this represented.   Politically,  this voluntary transfer removed an important leverfrom Persian hands. Technically, it enabled the civil route to be run jointly withthe military route to the considerable advantage of both.    11.  On these points, therefore, the Foreign Office  view is that we were ineach case on weak ground, that Persia was, in  practically  all of them, in aposition legally to secure what she wanted, and that no  exercise of diplomacy orfirmness, based, of course, on an element of bluff, would have enabled us to retain our pre-war position.  These outworks, to extend Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s metaphor,were captured less by the Persians than by the march of time, together withstronger positions elsewhere.    12.  In  paragraph  12  of the India  Office  memorandum,  considerableemphasis is laid on the instability of the present regime.   I should be reluctant to speculate on this.  On present form I should agree with the Secretary of State,but I have  heard the same thing said frequently in the past of Italy and Turkey,and in these cases every year  that passes makes less probable the prophecy  thatchaos would follow the  removal of Mussolini or Mustafa Kemal.  In the case ofthe Shah also much must  depend on time.  He has now reigned for nearly sevenjrears; he has extended  the power  of the Central Government over the whole of persia, and the country now looks to Tehran as the only centre of authority. Ifthe Shah lives a few years more the odds would increase against disintegrationon his death.  Nor should we be served by a reversion to anarchy or revolution.All things  considered, and this time including Moscow,  I would certainly prefer the Shah as a lesser evil. It is true that  the  break up  of the present regimemight at first somewhat strengthen our position in the Persian Gulf, enabling usto retain Hen jam and to develop the position of the Political Resident on pre-war-lines.  The ultimate consequence, however, could only be the advantage of SovietRussia and the development of a far more powerful centre than at present exists for Bolshevik intrigue in  the Middle East and India. It is no less important forus than for  Persia  herself that she should not fall completely  under  Russian:control.     13.  The India Office now recommend that we should take  &quot;a: firm line&quot;with Persia.  This could most easily, and  perhaps only, be translated into practice by a threat to break off negotiations.  But, as has been shown above, Persia atpresent, in so far as material considerations  are concerned and from  her  owncrudely Nationalist point of view, stands to benefit less  than  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  from  a general  settlement; while, in  the event of a rupture of   &apos;:&apos;  [7895] &quot;  &quot;&apos;                                        - -       B 3      -
Gnegotiations, our hostages in Persian hands are of considerable importance.  It isworth while to review them, an unpleasing ceremony, but one to which post-warforeign affairs have inured one for the reasons arrayed at the conclusion of thismemorandum.  Hostages are, indeed, the descendants of pioneers.  Persia,  then,-could probably, in the first place, obtain all her main desiderata, i.e., the reference of Bahrein to a judicial settlement, our evacuation of Hen jam,  the removal of theBushire Residency, and the complete repudiation of the debt. Secondly, she  could bring strong pressure to bear on His Majesty&apos;s Government through the vulner-ability  of the Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company, which  is now the most importantBritish interest in the Persian  Gulf.  This is a hostage with a vengeance ofwhich, in the course of these negotiations, I have been more than once remindedby the interested parties.  The royalties payable to the Persian Government haverecently fallen  heavily (from  1,300,000  to   300,000), a  campaign  has been launched against the company in  Persia, and it is not possible to count on thetruculent density of Persians to realise what is in their own ultimate interest.Here we may  well in the future be faced with the necessity of a firm and indeedvery strong  line,  which we could  not apply with  equal  justification on theother issues.     Thirdly,  there would be little hope of concluding, while the going  is yetgood, the proposed Shatt-el-Arab  Conservancy Board Convention,  to which sir  F. Humphrys  attaches  just importance.   It would in such case  probablybecome  impossible  to maintain the  Shatt-el-Arab waterway  to Basra.  Graveinjury would  thus  be caused to British shipping, the only Iraqi port would be cut off from  the sea.  with danger to the communications of the British  forces stationed in Iraq under the 1930 Treaty, and the operations of the Anglo-persian oil Company at Abadan wfould  suffer serious detriment.     14.  Nor is it clear how by  the suggested policy we should make Persia  appreciate  that  friendly relations with  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are not without their value.&quot;   A firm line  now. combined  with this  argument, wouldseem no more likely to achieve this object  than in  the past;  while it is  morethan likely to drive Persia into the arms of Russia, with consequences already described in another connexion.  Incidentally I should say that of course I  mademuch play with Teymourtache,  during his visit to England,  on  the  theme ofthe value of friendly relations with us, coupled with hints at the danger, in caseof estrangement, of being left en tete-a-tete with Soviet Russia.  Owing, however,to his native indecision the epithet is perhaps appropriate I produced novisible effect upon him, except satiety.     15.   And the policy of the strong line cannot safely be considered except ona field wider  than  that of Persia only.  There is  a world-psychology of  thesematters.  Account  must therefore be taken  of  the developments which  have occurred all over the world since 1922 a key date when Turkey called the bluffof the great  PoAvers,  and particularly of  this country, and  became  the firstaggressively-independent and  nationalist Middle Eastern State.  This examplewas soon contagious (for example, the attitude of Mexico to the United States).The minor, minimus, and all the uppish Lower School of Powers were quick toassume that they had no violence to fear from their war-weary and paper-boundmajors.  A  mental reservation is  made in the case  of more impulsive and lessconscientious  peoples, such as Italy or Japan.  But not in ours.  We  pass toour credit or  detriment for a &quot;good European,&quot; perhaps the only one.   Ourwords are our bonds, and others mark the trammels.   In these days of LeagueCovenants, Kellogg Pacts, and  General Acts, &quot;strong lines&quot; are difficult to execute, for  the  small Power is alive to its enhanced position.  We cannot eat all our words; we have said too many mouthfuls.  And &quot;would it  not be electorallyrather expensive if we tried?   In this particular case the real &quot;strong line&quot;seems that which I have advocated, namely, that we should seek to make ourselvesindependent of Persian goodwill as far as possible, so as to be able to negotiate with her on more equal terms.  But, if we cannot have a strong line because itcosts  100,000, we must expect that others are aware of our limitations.     16.  The above considerations apply to any continuance of the negotiationswith Persia on  a normal basis.  Meanwhile, however, a distinct and immediate problem has been created by the Persian notes of the 19th and the 22nd Septemberasking  for our  evacuation of. Hen jam.  On this point the Foreign Office view.
1(*is that we should be guided as far as possible by the advice of the man on the spot.It appears  doubtful  whether the Persian  Government mean this demand as more than a move in the general negotiations.  It is essential, however,  that this demand for immediate evacuation should be withdrawn, or at least shelved, ifthere is to be any question of further negotiations in any circumstances.  this seems to render some form of ultimatum inevitable, serious though the dangers of such a course may be.   Mr. Hoare has already been authorised to deliver tothe Persians a virtual  ultimatum on this issue,  and only comparatively minorquestions of tactics now  remain unsettled.   In the view of  the Foreign office mr. Hoare&apos;s advice on these points of tactics should as far as possible be  accepted.Too  categorical an ultimatum may, in Mr.  Hoare&apos;s opinion,  merely  precipitatea rupture and involve the evacuation of Hen jam -with all its attendant draw-backs and possibly without sufficient  delay to enable us to prepare another  baseelsewhere before  it is certain that such evacuation is absolutely inevitable.     17.  In conclusion therefore the Foreign Office view is      (a) That  as regards the immediate  issue of the reply to  be returned to the           Persian notes of the 19th and 22nd September, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-           ment should be guided as far as possible by the advice of His Majesty&apos;s           Minister at Tehran, the general line being that every effort should be           made to induce the Persians  to withdraw their demand.     (b) That  as regards the question of  Bahrein, it would in any case  be useful           and  prudent to obtain from the  Law Officers  of  the  Crown an           authoritative opinion on the  strength of our position.     (c) That  in the light of the Persian attitude over (a) and the  Law Officers&apos;           opinion on (6), the question of our  attitude and our assets should be           reconsidered.     ] 8.  On the score of the latter, I  venture here to offer some further and more detailed considerations on the question of linking our position at Hen jam withthe Persian debt.     Our uses of Hen jam  for coaling and recreational purposes may be brieflydescribed as a tacit revocable licence.   As to the debt, it is quite clear that thereAvas no agreement giving to His  Majesty&apos;s Government any rights in Henjam, or elsewhere in Persian territory, as a security  for the repayment of these monies.     It would, however, now appear to be suggested that we might, in spite ofthe Persian request for evacuation, continue to use Henjam, and to justify this-action on one  or all of the following grounds :      (a) that we intend to remain in Henjam until the debt is paid;     (b) that we have clearly stated that  our continued presence in Henjam is an           essential factor for the continuation of the treaty negotiations, and the           Persian Government have not terminated the treaty  negotiations;     (c) that having been  there for  many years, we are at the least entitled to a           reasonable notice before we leave, in order that we  might have time to           make suitable alternative arrangements  elsewhere, reasonable notice           in  our view being two years.    The British naval forces  are not,  I  think, continually present in largenumbers on Henjam, but go there from time  to time, leaving, in their absence, oneor two caretakers.   It can therefore not be overlooked that  persistence on  our part in using  the station,  in defiance of the Persian request to evacuate it, might lead to a situation where the naval forces on their return were met by a Persianofficial, possibly accompanied by some  armed force,  who would indicate  that under instructions from the Persian Government he was ordered to prevent theirlanding.  The continued use of the station might therefore mean the use of force by the British Navy against the Persian authorities.     But I leave this possibility  aside to pass to a stronger probability.  Underarticle 11, paragraph  2, of the  Covenant, Persia has the right  to bring to theattention  of  the Council  &apos;: any  circumstance whatever affecting  international relations that threaten to disturb international peace or the good understandinghetween nations upon  which peace depends.&quot;  There can, I  think, be  no doubtwhatever that Persia could therefore  bring this matter before the Council of theLeague of Nations under article 11.   It will  be remembered that in the recent case with regard to the Finnish ships, the Council recognised the right of Finland to
                                      sbring her claim for compensation to their shipowners before the Council underthis article clearly, in every sense  of the word, a far less serious or dangerousdispute than one between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Persia arising out ofthe continued use of the station at  Hen jam.  It is true that under this articlethe Council can only make recommendations and not give any binding decision,but  it is also true that, if the matter  were brought before the Council underthis article, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be forced to justify their action.     I might also add that Persia could bring the matter before the Council ofthe  League of Nations under article 15  if she  was prepared  to say thai thedispute was one &quot; which was likely  to lead to  a rupture.&quot;   The interpretationsof this article  hitherto followed by  the Council  go to show that if Persia wereto say that she considered the  dispute  likely to lead to a rupture, the council would have to  accept her statement and, if any forcible measures upon Persianterritory had been involved, it is not improbable that the Council would considerthat Persia was not exaggerating the matter in bringing it under article 15, where-under the Council is bound to investigate the case in all its legal aspects, and tomake a report.    . But  a  further  avenue   is open  to  the  Persian  Government.   HisMajesty&apos;s  Government  have  accepted the  Optional  Clause  subject  to the reservation (i) of reciprocity, and (ii) of the exclusion of disputes arising before.or arising out of, facts or situations  existing before His  Majesty&apos;s governments acceptance of the Clause.  I  do  not think that  the latter reservation would serve to take the present dispute out of our acceptance  of the Optional Clause, seeing that the  dispute would only  have arisen after Persians  request made this  year,that we  should evacuate the  station, and the situation out of which it arises is substantially the situation created  by this Persian request.   Persia has alsoacceded  to the  Optional Clause, and therefore (subject to the Persian reserya-tions) our  condition of reciprocity  is satisfied.   Persia has excepted disputesrelating to the territorial status of Persia, including disputes as to the sovereignty of Persia over its islands and forts.  Seeing, however, that we do not dispute the sovereignty  of Persia over Henjam,  it would appear that we could  not cite thisPersian  reservation  to dispute the jurisdiction of the Court under the optional clause.     I have set out above the  three defences which  it is  suggested  we  could make if  Persia brought this matter before the Council,  Permanent Court or anyother international body.  I do not believe that the defence that we were entitledto remain at the station until Persia had paid the alleged debt would in any waystand legal  examination.  The debt  was not  secured upon any rights in Persianterritory, and under international law to-day a State has no right  to occupy or use the territory of another  in  order to enforce  the repayment of a debt.   Thedefence with regard to the negotiations clearly Avould not be of much use to us,seeing that Persia could, even if she had not done so at the moment, rob it  of allvalue by terminating the negotiations.  The only defence,  therefore, for whichthere would be  anything to be said at all would be the one to the  effect that, evenif we had used the station under revocable licence, and  even if that licence hadbeen terminated, we were still entitled  to a reasonable  notice before we had to evacuate; but,  in order to entitle us to  use this defence, we should clearly haveto have  admitted the  fact that the  licence to use the  station had  been validlyterminated.  It is difficult to say whether it  could be established that as long astwo  years is reasonably required to evacuate;  but it is at least doubtful whether any  Court would consider that so long a time was necessary.     For  all the foregoing reasons I submit that it would be dangerous to  proceedwith the idea of linking Henjam and Debt.     19.  Since this memorandum was written the Persian Government have madea direct attack upon the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. As stated in paragraph 13above, I  regard the  company&apos;s concession as in a class by itself.  I have alwaysthought  that a show-down on that issue might be inevitable.  But in that eventour  case against Persia must surely be weakened by its extension  to cover less essential and less tenable &quot;outworks.&quot;     20.  I  venture, summing  up  briefly,  to  submit that  it has  been the considered  policy of  our  successive  Governments since  the war  not  to  takethe  &quot;strong line&quot; in  an  advanced  and vulnerable   position,  but rather towithdraw in an orderly manner to  positions materially and morally  defensible.
Policy and necessity have combined to impose this upon us; and if we have in public emphasised the former factor, the foreigner in private has noted the latter.In the case of Germany there is a  renascent misgiving whether the leopard  hasreally changed its spots through a hiding.   Our case is, of course, different;  ourpacific professions are universally received, and have been fortified by long-currentdoubts of our financial and military strength. The former category has been largelyremoved  since last year, but the latter remains;  indeed, we have frequently andpublicly made a virtue of the extent of our disarmament as well as of our fidelity toour obligations.   We have encouraged the little  Powers in a manner that wouldhave  astonished  Lord  Palmerston or a  relative  of  mine  who, forty  yearsago, was removed from Her Majesty&apos;s Service for the monotony  of his gambit:&quot; Mais vous n&apos;etes qu&quot;une petite puissance.&quot;  Now many  of them, and  Persiansin particular, are making up for that lost  time.  They are very possibly settinga pace too hot to last, seeing  that  they are often totally, not to say hopelessly,unfitted for the position to which they have been promoted in a world professedlyathirst for order and reason.  Whether the League can eventually endure withits present relation of  major and minor Powers may be questioned in  our time.We may already observe that it is sometimes unwieldy,  as in the case of  theDisarmament Conference, and sometimes,  as in this matter  of the  Far  East,dangerous.                                                                    R. V.    December 2, 1932.
