THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1932.SECRET.                                               Copy No.      9O.P. 421 (32).CABINET.CANCELLATION OF ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY&apos;S                       CONCESSION.     MEMORANDUM BY THE PERMANENT UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR                             FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    IT will  be  remembered that at their meeting on the 30th November theCabinet discussed the action of the Persian Government in cancelling the Anglo-Persian  Oil  Company&apos;s  concession, and  reached  the  conclusion  (see cabinet conclusions No. 64 of that date) that a very strong protest should be immediatelymade to the Persian Government by His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran, and that meanwhile the possibility of protecting the Company&apos;s property in Persia, whetherby local and direct action or by retaliation elsewhere, or both, should be further examined.    2.   Mr.  Hoare&apos;s  own recommendations  had  not  arrived  when  these conclusions were reached,  but when received they were found to suggest a lineof action no less  strong  than that already  decided  upon by  the Cabinet.&quot; A definite challenge,&quot; he said in his telegram No.  193, &quot; has been issued, witha latent threat of force, and both the challenge  and the threat must be definitelymet.....  It is conceivable that an endeavour will be made to explain mattersaway on lines similar to  the Henjam  case, but circumstances  are so differentand so greatly aggravated by publicity that no explanations short of the definitewithdrawal of the letter would appear adequate.   Our case is so good, and the offence so flagrant,  that considerable gain to our position  here may result fromdrastically bringing the matter to an issue.&quot;    3.   Meanwhile, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s representative in Tehranhad  replied to the Persian Minister of  Finance  in a letter in  which,  afterrepudiating seriatim the latter&apos;s accusations against the Company, he requested the withdrawal of the Persian Government&apos;s public announcement regarding the cancellation as a preliminary to any further negotiations.  This was followed up(on the 2nd December) by Mr. Hoare&apos;s official note  to the Minister for ForeignAffairs, which contained a definite demand  for the immediate withdrawal ofthe notification of cancellation and a threat that His Majesty&apos;s Government would&quot; take all legitimate measures to protect their just and indisputable interests &quot;and &quot;would not tolerate&quot; any interference with the Company&apos;s  activities onPersian soil.    4.   It is  clear from telegrams received, both  direct  from  Mr. Hoare and through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, that the Persian Ministers (as distinct from the Shah himself, regarding whose views  no indication has been received)were greatly perturbed by this firm line on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Minister for Foreign Affairs sought to minimise the gravity of the matter&apos;&apos; in view of the expressed readiness of the Persian Government to conclude a newconcession,&quot; and the Minister of Finance,  in the course of  a conversation with aPersian confidential employee of the Anglo-Persian  Oil Company, expressed theview that the withdrawal  of the notification of cancellation (which had alreadybeea unanimously approved by the Persian Chamber) would endanger the position       6635  [7950]
not only of the existing  Persian  Government,  but also  of the  Shah himself.Apparently both the Shah and the Minister of Finance had anticipated that the cancellation of the concession would at once bring the Company  to its kneeswithout provoking any definite reaction on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.  -  5.  Mr.  Hoare has  since  suggested  (see  his  telegram  No.  206  of  the2nd December) that it may well be impossible for  the present or  any other PersianGovernment to persuade the Shah to accept the humiliation involved in a definitewithdrawal of the cancellation.   He  thinks (see his  telegram No. 207 of the2nd December) that persistence in the demand already officially made for with-drawal must lead &quot;to one of three situations, viz. :     (1)  A protracted stalemate;    (2)  The capitulation  of the Shah, whose position  may thereby be seriously           endangered;    (3)  The  refusal  of  the Shah  to  capitulate,  followed  by  some  form of           demonstration  on  his  part,  which  would  necessitate  the  forcible           occupation of the oil-fields.    6.  Mr. Hoare urges that, in view of these three possibilities, the possibility should now be considered  of devising some compromise which would enable the shah  to retreat from the dilemma  without too great a loss of face.  He suggeststhat we should not maintain our  insistence on the definite withdrawal of the note of cancellation,  but should induce the Persian  Government  to  give a formalassurance that they will regard  the  Company&apos;s freedom of negotiation as in no way impaired by that note, and will respect the staUcs quo with regard to theCompany until the negotiations are brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.    7.  The Foreign Office, on the other hand, feel that the suggested compromiseis incompatible  with the  firm line already taken on  the basis of  the  cabinet conclusions of the 30th November and originally  approved by Mr. Hoare himself;they consider that  it would involve  too great a loss of face for  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  In the last four years we have constantly put ourselves out to deviseways  of saving  the Persians from humiliating  situations, and the dilemma inwhich they now find themselves provides us with an excellent opportunity to teachthe Shah a long-overdue lesson.  The Foreign Office see no reason to anticipate that the Shah&apos;s position would collapse if he were forced  to capitulate over thisquestion; he is for all practical purposes an absolute despot,  and, though  he iswell hated, there is no apparent organised opposition which could overthrow him.    8.  The  Anglo-Persian Oil Company  have received from their  Tehranrepresentative a recommendation on  similar lines to Mr. Hoare&apos;s, but going stillfurther  in  the direction of conciliation and compromise.   They are content toleave  the question of immediate policy entirely to Flis Majesty&apos;s  Government.They  consider, however, that in the long run it will probably be necessary to devisesome  form of compromise if a stalemate is to be  avoided.    9.  Further consideration has, meanwhile,  been given by  the Foreign OfficeLegal Advisers to the  situation  in international law which would be created bya resort to any of the various forms of direct action contemplated by the cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ifsuch action were taken without,  in the first place, exhausting  the legal remedieswhich arbitration provides.  In  its present stage the dispute is undoubtedly onewhich His Majesty&apos;s Government would  be entitled to take  either before  theCouncil of the League of  Nations  under articles 11 and 15 of the Covenant, or before the  Permanent Court of  International Justice  at  The Hague under  the optional Clause.    If, disregarding  these means  of  pacific  settlement of  thedispute, His Majesty&apos;s Government were to resort to any act of force on PersianSoil or against Persian warships  in order to protect the interests of the Company,their  action would be similar from the legal point of view to that of the JapaneseGovernment in Manchuria, but without the excuse that the lives of their nationalswere  in  danger.   In that event, the Persian Government would, in their turn, beable to bring the question before the League Council under articles  11 and  15 ofthe Covenant, or before The Hague Court under the terms of the Optional Clause.If they were to appeal under article 15, it must  be emphasised that the question to be  decided by the Council would be, not the  legitimacy or otherwise of  the
original  Persian  action  in cancelling the  Concession  (in  regard to which thecase of His Majesty&apos;s Government is extremely strong), but the legitimacy orotherwise of  the  action of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  resorting to force onPersian territory in order to protect the interests of a British company, althoughthe means of recourse  to the Council and to The Hague Court were both opento them.   If the matter were to come up in this form, the question of the legiti-macy of.Persia&apos;s action in cancelling the Concession  would  tend to sink  intothe background, and it Avould be the action  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not that of the Persian  Government, which would be  under adjudication.  In theopinion of the Foreign Office Legal Advisers,  it is almost certain that a majorityof the Council would  in such an eventuality  regard the action of Flis Majesty&apos;sGovernment as illegal  and unjustified under international law;  and it is quite certain that if the same question were to be referred by Persia to the Assembly,and not to the Council, the votes of the small States and of the Latin Americanmembers would  ensure a  large majority  against  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.Were the matter  referred to the Council,  His Majesty&apos;s Government  wouldprobably be able to count on the support of Japan alone to prevent a unanimousrecommendation under article 15 that His Majesty&apos;s Government should with-draw their troops or cease the forcible action  which they had embarked upon;and the general consensus of international opinion would.undoubtedly be that ifthe action of Japan  in  Manchuria  had weakened and rendered  doubtful the efficacy of procedure before the League and The Hague  Court, the action of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Persia  had completed in this respect  the destructivework of Japan.    10.  In  the  opinion of  the  Foreign Office  Legal Advisers, it is to beanticipated that a verdict even more unanimously unfavourable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  would be given in  the  event of recourse by Persia to The Hague court under  the  Optional Clause  for damages, on the  ground that the forcibleaction of His Majesty&apos;s Government was unjustified under international law.    11.  It will be seen from the foregoing observations that, were His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to disregard all international means of pacific settlement and proceedforthwith to  forcible measures, even  under the strongest provocation on the partof the Persian  Government, they would place themselves in a position in whichthe tables could be completely turned on them by Persia, and from having  the lawon their side, would become liable to be shown to be entirely in the wrong byany international tribunal to which the Persian Government chose to take them.    12.  There is a  further  reason (though a less cogent one) for refraining from forcible measures on Persian soil so long as there remain other and peaceablemeans of securing the withdrawal of the Persian note cancelling the  Company&apos;sconcession.   The  second  protocol  annexed  to  the  Perso-Soviet  Treaty of guarantees and Neutrality of 1927 expressly  provides for the maintenance inforce of article 6 of the Perso-Soviet Treaty  of 1921, which lays down that &quot; ifa Third  Power attempts  to realize,  by armed intervention, a policy  of violenceon Persian soil ..... and if, after  due warning by the Soviet Government, thePersian Government show themselves to be not sufficiently strong  to avert this danger, the Soviet Government shall  have the right to despatch troops to Persianterritory in  order to take such military measures as may be necessary for self-defence.&quot;  Whether or not  the armed intervention  of British  military forcessolely to protect  the oil fields from  attack could properly be described as &quot;anattempt to realize ....  a policy of violence on Persian territory,&quot; it is certainthat Persia would describe it as  such, and if, as may confidently be assumed, she were unable  to offer  effective resistance to a  British  expeditionary force, she might in the last resort be forced to countenance an armed incursion  of russian troops  into Persian territory. Such a contingency is admittedly  remote,  in viewof Persia&apos;s  traditional fear of  Russian aggression,  but the  relevant article  iscouched in terms so vague that  it might be possible  for the Soviet Governmentto claim  the right, in the last resort, to decide  without reference to Persiawhether a situation had been created which would justify their  intervention onPersian soil.
    13.  The recommendations of the Foreign Office may therefore be summarisedas follows :       (i) That Mr. Hoare&apos;s new proposal, involving a radical modification of the          demand already made to the Persian Government for the withdrawal          of the note of cancellation, cannot be adopted without serious loss of          face for His Majesty&apos;s Government.     (ii) That consequently His Majesty&apos;s Minister should  continue to take a          strong line and to press for the definite  withdrawal  of the note of          cancellation  as  an essential  preliminary  to  any  resumption  of          negotiations between the Persian Government and the Company.    (iii) That if the official demand for withdrawal already made should elicit          an unsatisfactory reply, or if no reply should be received by, say, the          10th  December, Mr. Hoare should inform  the  Persian Government          that the matter will be brought by His Majesty&apos;s Government before          the Permanent  Court  of International Justice  at The Hague under          the Optional  Clause, unless the cancellation is  withdrawn within a          week from the date of that notification.     (iv) That this threat should be put into effect by His Majesty&apos;s Government          without hesitation if the need should arise.     (v) That even in the face of grave provocation, such as a serious  attempt to          hamper the activities of the Company, His Majesty&apos;s Government          would be on  weak and dangerous ground  in  resorting to forcible          measures, whether of protection or retaliation, until the resources of          pacific settlement provided  by  the League  Council  and The Hague          Court have been exhausted.    (vi) That  it is nevertheless  essential to  provide  against  possible Persian          attacks on the Company&apos;s property and premises in Persia while the          proceedings are pending before the Court.   The Statute and Rules of          Procedure of  the Court, however,  provide a procedure intended for          use in such circumstances, and it is the view of the Foreign Office that          recourse should be had to this procedure before anything in the nature          of forcible action on Persian territory  is contemplated.   Article 41 of          the Statute of the Court provides as follows :                &quot; The Court shall have  the power  to indicate, if it considers that          circumstances so require, any provisional measures which ought to be          taken to reserve the respective rights of either party.               &quot;Pending  the final decision,  notice  of the measures suggested          shall forthwith be given to the parties and the Council.&apos;&apos;    . ;          And article 57 of the Rules of Court is in the following terms :                &quot;An application made  to the  Court by one or both of the parties,          for  the  indication of interim  measures  of protection, shall have          priority over all other cases.  The  decision thereon shall be treated as-          a matter of urgency, and if the Court is not sitting, it shall be convened          without delay by the President for the purpose.               &quot;If no application is made, and  if the Court is not sitting, the          President may convene the Court to submit to it the question whether          such  measures are expedient.               &quot; In all cases, the Court shall only indicate measures of protection          after giving the parties an opportunity of presenting their observa-          tions on the subject.&quot;        It is  obvious that in the event of the Court  indicating  &quot; measures of          protection &quot; and the Persian Government refusing to carry them out,          the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government  for taking such action as might          be absolutely necessary to protect the property of the Company would          be greatly strengthened.  We could, of course, inform the Persians          of our intention to apply to the Court for &quot; provisional measures,&quot;          and indicate that, in the event of  their not complying with any such          measures which might be indicated by the Court, we must reserve our          right to take such action as the circumstances might require.
